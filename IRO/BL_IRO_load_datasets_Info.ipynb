Some block designs signify collections (such as the Cottons or Harleys) much like individual coats of arms relate to hereditary lines. Other blocks are purely decorative. The block is positioned and fastened into a heated platen on a blocking machine. After reaching the correct temperature, the operator applies gold leaf or gold foil (powdered gold on a plastic film) onto the surface to be blocked, then aligns the surface under the platen. At the pull of a lever, the surface rises to meet the block and an impression is made. The trick is to get the right temperature and impression pressure.

In order to enable access to web archives, UKWA uses CDX files to act as indexes so that it is possible to look up which ARC or WARC files contain which URLs and responses. In partnership with the Internet Archive and JISC, UKWA had obtained access to the subset of the Internet Archive’s web collection that relates to the UK. The JISC UK Web Domain Dataset (1996 - 2013) contains all of the resources from the Internet Archive that were hosted on domains ending in ‘.uk’, or that are required in order to render those UK pages.
