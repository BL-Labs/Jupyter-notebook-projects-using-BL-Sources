# Jupyter Notebooks using BL Collections data and Sources
A list of Jupyter Notebooks' projects using BL's Collections data and Sources.

Jupyter Notebooks is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

- [Applied Data Analysis](https://github.com/mromanello/ADA-DHOxSS2019) as taught at DHOxSS 2019: covers tidying data, visualization, modeling, and advanced applications of data analysis. By Giovanni Colavizza and Matteo Romanello (run them on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mromanello/ADA-DHOxSS2019/master));

- [LibCrowds Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/LibCrowds/notebooks) - explore the data created via the British Library's [LibCrowds](http://libcrowds.com/) platform, which includes crowdsourced transcriptions of historic playbills and catalogue data from card catalogues (run them on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/libcrowds/notebooks/master?urlpath=lab)).

- [topic-modeling-billing Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/hibernator11/notebook-texts-metadata/blob/master/topic-modeling-billing.ipynb) - Topic Models are a type of statistical language models used for discovering hidden structure in a collection of texts; this example is based on a dataset that comprises 264 volumes of digitised theatrical playbills published between 1660 – 1902 (mostly 19th century) from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Digitised from the British Library's physical collection of over 500 volumes of playbills, the dataset contains text files in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) format. More information about the dataset at https://data.bl.uk/playbills/ (run it on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hibernator11/notebook-texts-example/master?urlpath=notebooks/topic-modeling-billing.ipynb)).

# In this Repository (Work In Progress)
- [Microsoft19thCenturyBooks / base.ipynb](Microsoft19thCenturyBooks/base.ipynb): examples of different types of access and ways to load source data from The British Library Collections; includes some basic processing and visualisation;

### Other projects using BL Collections data and Sources

- [r-for-newspapers-data](https://github.com/yannryan-irl/r-for-newspapers-data) - The repository for the in-progress open book, 'R for Newspaper Data'. By Yann Ryan.
