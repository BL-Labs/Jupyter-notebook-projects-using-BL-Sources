Translated from Burger. I had forgotten all about the other letter with its correct English address, and it probably would have decayed on the spot where it had fallen but for its being recalled to my remem brance later on in the evening by the receipt of a somewhat bulky packet, the outside of which bore my name in the same well-formed though rather stiff characters. The letter had been dated from the ' Hotel des Trois"], [57, "LETTER NUMBER TWO 45 Rois ' in Lucerne ; the packet came from the primitive Wirthschaft ' Zum Goldenen Lowen ' in the village of Brunnen. My unknown cor respondent was following me up with a ven geance. I began to think it was high time to see what he wanted. I went out again upon the terrace, picked up the neglected letter, opened it, and read as follows : ' Sir, \u2014 Your sister Aileen has commis sioned me to give you a packet containing a manuscript in her own hand, and a few other trifles which she hopes you will do her the kindness to accept. I shall be in Brunnen to-morrow evening, and will send them up to you by a special messenger, according to promise. Should you wish to see me after perusing the MS., I will do myself the honour of calling upon you. I shall remain twenty four hours in Brunnen.

' Your present address I obtained from the proprietor of this hotel. I regret to hear that you have been ill. ' Yours faithfully, ' Gerald Malcolmson.' This very dry, matter-of-fact, yet puzzling epistle contained two or three rather startling clauses. 'Your sister Aileen.' For the world, my sister Aileen was Miss Aileen Smythe, of course ; what on earth did this absolute stranger mean by writing so familiarly about her ? ' I shall presume that you prefer not to know me.' Why should my sister's trusted messenger imagine the possibility of that ? There being nobody to answer these questions, I turned my attention to the packet that might contain the solution of"], [59, "LETTER NUMBER TWO 47 them. It did contain it in a very lengthened form. Swathed in two or three utterly useless articles of feminine handiwork, fit for nothing but a bazaar, I drew forth a bundle of paper, neatly sewed together, and closely written upon. This handwriting I instantly recognised as no forgery to impose upon me, but really and truly that of my sister Aileen. Now I liked Aileen. I am not sure that the small modicum of affection I bestowed upon her could be dignified by the name of love, but she was not totally indifferent to me. I had taken up arms against the dragon Atkinson principally on her account. I could not think of her moist little kisses upon my cheek without a sensation of tenderness. I had long ago made up my mind that when I was lord of Ballyacora Hall no one should hector my little Aileen but myself, and above all things she should never have a husband to scold her, untd I had fully satisfied myself"], [60, "48 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE that he would do it mildly. Indeed I some times thought, when my tenderness was at its climax, that I would never let her marry at all. If this Mr. Gerald Malcolmson therefore had come to Switzerland to get my help to enable him to approach Aileen as a suitor, he would have to submit to being called pretty smartly over the coals. Of course communications of some kind or another came to me from time to time from Ballyacora Hall. My father's epistles were usually full of glowing anticipations concern ing a man child yet to be born into a world anxiously awaiting his advent \u2014 his grandson and a Duke's \u2014 but, as they also usually con tained money, I put that thought away from me as something that would wait till to morrow. Florence's, Mabel's and Aileen's were short rehearsals in various keys, from F sharp to G minor, of their own dull lives and"], [61, "LETTER NUMBER TWO 49 their wish that something would happen to enliven them: 'Even a murder' \u2014 so, on one occasion, had written Mabel, who seemed to be developing, according to promise, into an odd character \u2014 ' would be refreshing. I look round sometimes and wonder whether I should not be a public benefactor by getting up some such variation.' But only Aileen's \u2014 pretty, blue-eyed Aileen's \u2014 ever contained a word of genuine love. The last month, however, had witnessed the advent of no letter at all \u2014 and, to tell the truth, I had neither sorrowed nor won- dered over the omission. Since that memo- rable event on the promenade of Lucerne, the current of my life had set in a fresh direction, and, fascinated by the new scenes and im- pressions among which it had conducted me, I had almost forgotten the stagnant pool of home and its forlorn inmates.

I nearly sprang out of my ambush \u2014 should have done so if he had touched her. But the impetuosity of his forward movement had been but the mechanical yielding of the body to the passion of the soul. He had evidently resolved to exhaust argument before resorting to force.

Dost remember it ? ' ' Yes, oh yes, yes !

I stayed my hand for a moment, angry at the interruption ; then forgot my fell purpose in watching thee. ' As thou earnest onward at first only a tiny bright speck at the extreme end of one of the dark stately avenues all converging towards me, I fancied the very sunbeams above the mighty trees were all enamoured of thee, for, whenever it was possible, one of them was sure to creep in to nestle warmly Dn thy golden hair.'

She sighed, and moved slightly, with an evident sensation of relief, while the violet came back into her raised orbs, deepened by a tear. His gentleness alarmed me more than his anger. I began to doubt whether her heart could resist it. ' Thy hat was in thy hand, Kathchen, and thy fair hair fell unconfined around thee ; thy cheek, usually a little pale for one so young, was flushed by warmth and exercise : now and then I saw thee stoop to pick up a fallen cone. Every one of thy movements was full of an in describable grace \u2014 not the studied grace of our court ladies, taught by a dancing-master : only nature had been thy mistress.

If my heart were softening under it, how much more must hers ? ' Thou earnest on through the lonely wood, my Kathe, like an embodied innocence. Thy sweet presence calmed even me and stayed my intention. The fowling-piece fell from my hand. ' Thou hadst not seen me yet, Kiithe, hidden as I was behind a tree-stem, the dark grey and green of my shooting costume harmonising almost completely with the tints of nature ; but now thy guide's more practised eye caught mine, meeting his frowningly, and he stood still, petrified with terror, probably knowing"], [227, "HE AND SHE AGAIN 215 that he had sinned, and conscious of deserving punishment.

Have pity on me, Kiithe, have pity ! ' She was in an agony of weeping now, her slight frame convulsed. I looked pleadingly at Moppert, but he shook his head still. ' Weine nicht, mein Liebling, or, rather, weep on until that frozen, implacable \" No\" in thy dear eyes is dissolved for ever. I let my untried patience break where it should have been strongest, and frightened my timid bird. Men are not like women, Kathe ; their passions will not always obey the curb.

The desperate struggle between passion and self-control was grim and fierce, but the latter, though with trembling hands, kept the reins still. His voice, when he could make it audible again, was gentler, tenderer than ever. ' Thou wast not afraid of me that morning in the forest, Kathe, nor shrank then from my presence. Thy own heart was thy teacher, unbiassed by prejudice, unpoisoned by base words of calumny. Men are not women, as I said before, and very narrow-minded must be the woman who would measure them by her standard of right and wrong. We must learn to be good, Kathe, by sinning.

No suspicion clouded thy fair face when I dismissed thy guide and offered to conduct thee myself to the palace.

I have forgotten the story ; hardly listened to the words of the song, so matchless was the voice trilling it. Something about a dead father, an unhappy home, a hard stepmother who had made escape from that home like release from a prison, and a few bright hopes for the future. Thou hadst suffered, Kathchen, and thy song, my bird, was very plaintive, tremulous and unsteady. But soon in the new and unaccustomed sunshine it swelled into a gladder key, and thy tender heart peeped out of the dreary convent where it had been educated, to sun itself in the ripen ing light of love. Thy blue eyes looked up into mine as fearlessly as they had looked into the guide's, but differently too. When turned on him, though very gently, they had commanded ; now they sued.' Oh, I had reason to fear for her ! With"], [232, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 220 inimitable skill, with matchless art, he was playing on the chords of her too susceptible heart, and every quivering nerve responded. ' And they did not sue in vain, my Kathe. I walked by thy side only as a protector, the yearning of my heart as pure as thine. There was no lack of Wurde in thy matchless Anmuih, and where dignity and grace are combined, the woman rises above the man's level and is stronger than he. Every word, every look, every movement of thine, re vealed the inborn lady, that man-subduing element in women which even a queen may be without. Thy Anmuih, even more than thy beauty, attracted me, as the butterfly yonder is attracted by the sweet scent of the flowers ; but thy Wurde held a shield before thee, an impenetrable one, which has resisted all attack, and kept me in perpetual check until now.

I would make compensation to thy sex for the wrong I had done them by unceasing goodness to thee.' The very stones might have been melted by the pleading pathos of his voice. Even Moppert's inflexibility seemed to falter. A perceptible tremor passed through him. The Prince continued : ' Was it wrong to lead thee further into the wood, to determine to finger to the utmost in the first absolutely pure com panionship I had ever known ? Yet I never touched thee till thy foot stumbled against some obstacle, and thou, of thy own accord, put thy hand upon my arm. Oh, the magic of that touch, Kathchen ! The magic of a touch which no man, even the most blessed, ever feels but once.' I could not help echoing his deep sigh ; and I think Moppert echoed it too. The"], [234, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 222 tears of his beautiful companion had ceased to flow, and she sat listening to him in a momently deepening trance. I seared she was lost ; and I feared, too, that we were losing the power to help her. ' We passed out of the pine-wood into an adjoining one of oaks and elms and stately beeches. Thy hand touched a bramble-bush, the tender skin was torn and bled. I led thee to a pond I knew of to wash away the tiny blood-drop. The colour had left thy cheek and I moistened thy face with water. I rent my handkerchief in twain to bind up the wound : I have it still, the torn morsel, stained with thy blood.

Thou hadst nearly driven me to hurt thee, and when a man, forced thereunto by keenest suffering, hurts what he loves, the pain he inflicts falls back upon him self again like an added curse.

The ever-watchful instinct, the undaunted courage of the true soldier, must have been an integral part of his nature in spite of all his wickedness \u2014 wickedness which on account of its very excess raised him above contempt, placed him upon a pedestal of crime, and forced you, looking up, to do involuntary homage to the grandeur of the terrible. His face, so violently agitated but a second before, grew hard and cold as iron. The smile hovering round his mouth changed instantaneously into the haughty sneer of con temptuous recognition. No shadow of either surprise or fear modified the intense virulence"], [242, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 230 of the conscious hate with which he honoured the implacability of the two enemies before him. For he knew us. With the most admirable self-possession he gently laid the lady on the sward, stooped to pick up his fallen walking-stick, and ad vanced towards us. The supple ease of his movements \u2014 that rare combination of strength with lightness which arises from the perfec tion of proportion \u2014 ravished my eye in spite of myself. A prince of darkness he was, maybe, but nevertheless a prince \u2014 his patent of nobility given him by Nature. ' You have disturbed me, gentlemen,' he said courteously \u2014 the courtesy of defiance. ' Nevertheless, since you are here, we may as well settle our accounts with one another.

' Are you going to summon the universe to be your witness, as you did last time we met, monsieur? That was rather a fine bit of acting, by-the-bye. There was a spice of real tragedy in it.

You need a deal of thrashing to teach you humility. You have recently had a dose which ought to satisfy you, but there is plenty more of the same sort ; wuchtige Deutsche Hiebe, smart English slaps with the flat of the sword, the stinging lashes of Austro-Hungary.' Still Moppert was silent. ' Pour moi, j'ai eu assez de tragedie aujour d'hui. 1 have been having a private rehearsal, and it has exhausted me. I am weary of it.

I started forward, uttering an indignant exclamation. ' Ah,' said the Prince, pretending to recog nise me for the first time, ' it is the young English chanticleer, burning with emulation to win his spurs in the sacred cause of friend ship. It is touching. I feel almost tempted to break out into those world-renowned lines of Schiller's : Ich sey, gewahrt mir die Bitte, In eurem Bunde der Dritte ! only I have the sense to see that I should be a very incongruous element.'

Saying which, he suddenly shifted his walking-stick, called out to Moppert, and I became spectator of a desperate struggle.

I was in no sense of the word a free agent, only one working wheel in the complicated machinery of circumstances, driven to action by an over powering force beyond and outside me. Then the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of brilliant colours arranged itself afresh. The Prince had wrenched himself free from the iron grip with which we held as we chastised him.

Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small ; Though with patience He stands waiting, with exactness grinds He all. Translated by Longfellow from Feiedrich von Logan. It was in Saxon Switzerland, not far from the beautiful city of Dresden, that Katherine Ludovica Theda von Mandelsloh first became conscious of life. From out the confused and misty memories of early childhood two or three pictures still stand out prominently, painted in vivid colours by pleasure and pain. Behind these pictures, forming, as it were, their ever-shifting background, rise visions of sharply-cut hill-tops, piercing a deep-blue sky ;"], [259, "IN SCHLOSS MANDELSLOH 247 broad meadows and narrow vales at their base, through which rivulets foamed and fretted or broad streams flowed eagerly in their onward striving towards the sea. Stately forest trees \u2014 now bright with the fresh green of spring, now red, golden and russet brown \u2014 grew around and among them ; and thick and dark pine woods filled the evening air with their spicy odour. For sounds there were the tinkling bells of the cattle ; the Jodeln of the herdsman ; the deep bay of the hounds ; the gentle ripple of the rivulets ; the love-sick song of the nightingale ; the croaking of frogs in the marshes ; the on coming sough of the hurricane ; the roar of the cataract ; the whirr of the spinning wheels ; the stern voice of the house's master ; the gleeful songs of the maids ; and, sweetest and best-remembered of all, the gentle voice of the mother. And these sights and sounds sank into"], [260, "248 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE the heart of the child and became a part of her. Very early too came the knowledge of superior rank. Little Kathe knew almost before she could speak what it meant to be a Countess of Mandelsloh. Whether romping among the fragrant hay with the maidens, or sitting poppy-crowned on some broad shoulder among the reapers \u2014 whether gathering with numbed fingers snowdrops for the Miitterchen or wandering bare-headed among the roses, she was ever conscious of superior dignity. And even when tripping by her mother's side to the village church amidst the sweet chiming of the bells, and smilingly returning the salu tations of the common folk, she would keenly notice any omission on their part and proudly resent it. For, was it not in the natural order of things that the peasants should labour for the high-born ? Were they not created to till the"], [261, "IN SCHLOSS MANDELSLOH 249 ground for them, and face for them an enemy's musketry ? Was it not her home \u2014 the still stately Schloss on the hillside, its turrets gleaming white against the dark background of the woods, and looking down, even in its ruined splendour, for ever looking down on the humble homes of the people? These things seemed to her the natural sequence of immutable law. For how could she know of the mighty change going steadily on in the hearts of the down-trodden people? a change destined to shake to its very foundations the so-called rights of the high born ! The household consisted of the master, the now rather feeble Graf von Mandelsloh ; his daughter, little Kathe's mother ; one man servant ; two maidens ; and last, not least, a noble boar-hound, called Ino \u2014 the child's sole playfellow. Of her father Kathe knew nothing. On"], [262, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 250 the few occasions when she had spoken of or asked about him, she had been instantly silenced even by her gentle mother, and once so sternly by her grandfather that she had not dared to mention him again. And now comes one of the pictures painted so vividly on her memory \u2014 painted there by humiliation and pain. Part of the castle, now so pitifully reduced from its former grandeur, was quite in ruins. To this part Kathe had been forbidden to go, but, child-like, she longed all the more ardently to do so, for what is so attractive as the forbidden? Already, accompanied by Ino, his conscious tail between his legs, she had tasted the delights of disobedience, and as yet Retribution was in abeyance. But Retri bution only bides its time. They used to sit there, the child and the dog, both equally conscious of wrongdoing, listening to the cry of the owls, or starting in"], [263, "IN SCHLOSS MANDELSLOH 251 terror from the bats, or watching the curious creeping things, battening on decay, which crept out of chinks and crannies in the ruins, looking at them bolder than they, conscience stricken, dared look back. And these crea tures \u2014 the offspring of corruption \u2014 seemed to say \u2014 at least the child fancied so \u2014 ' Your time has come and gone ; the turn is now at us, little Frblen.' It was on one of these occasions that Ino, starting up from a doze by the side of his little mistress, uttered a furious bark, instantly strangled by his perfect consciousness that he must not bark in that place. Then Kathe became aware that a stranger had approached them, and was gazing at her with a look of interest which terrified her exceedingly. The little Countess never forget the ap pearance of this stranger. He was very beautiful, far more beautiful than anyone she had ever seen before, and though his"], [264, "252 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE face was strange to her, yet it was somehow familiar too. It was like some other face \u2014 whose she could not say, but it was one she knew well. He was tall, this stranger, and his figure was gracefully, although powerfully, moulded. But what the child noticed most was the beauty of his golden hair and bright blue eyes. The expression in these eyes repelled and attracted her at the same time. And when he smiled, she felt a strange tremble at her heart, as if something had touched it that had a right to touch, awakening a long-lost echo. But Ino was not attracted. His bark had subsided into alow growl of fierce defiance, and his teeth were displayed, and he stood there, ready to tear the intruder to the ground. ' Send the dog away,' said the stranger. Trembling and frightened as the child was, she felt constrained to do as she was bidden. She"], [265, "IN SCHLOSS MANDELSLOH 253 bade Ino return to his kennel in the court yard. But the dog, accustomed to obey her every sign, refused to go, absolutely. ' Take him away,' said the stranger in a sweet melodious voice, wholly dissonant to his words, ' or I shall kill him.' Kathe, again awed by the same strange sensations, took Ino by the collar, and was leading him away when the stranger called after her. ' Come back again, you. I want to speak to you.' He spoke with the easy confidence of one who was sure of submission, and sat down carelessly among the ruins, waiting. Kathe, trembling, led the dog back to his kennel and chained him there. But this occult power, stronger than her own will and desire, forced her to return and stand alone before him. She was not used to stand thus, while"], [266, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 254 another lay on the ground at her feet. Poor and almost ruined as was the high-born house of Mandelsloh, its traditions still lingered. Nevertheless something stronger than her pride kept her where she was, awaiting his pleasure. His pleasure seemed to be to keep her wait ing ; to test to its utmost the strange power he felt, and she felt, he had over her. Then he said, carelessly and smilingly \u2014 with that same smile that made her heart throb again \u2014 ' You are a good girl, little one. At all events they have taught you to obey.' ' They ? What did he mean ? ' As if he had read the unspoken question in her dilated eyes, he answered it : ' The old fool in yonder, Graf Mandelsloh, and his too submissive daughter.' ' They are my mother and grandfather,' answered the child, strangling the sob in her throat."], [267, "IN SCHLOSS MANDELSLOH 255 ' Are they fond of you ? ' he asked abruptly, with that same strange smile, so bright and yet so heartless, which fascinated while it repelled her. Fond of her ? Kathe had never asked herself that question, nor could have answered it. They were hers, and she was theirs. The same pulse throbbed in their veins ; the same proud, passionate, yet intensely loving heart beat in their bosoms. ' They are my mother and grandfather,' she repeated falteringly, and now the great tears began to fall. ' Ha ! Yet thou art not like them, except for thy haughty carriage and that proud and defiant look in thy blue eyes. Little aristo crat, knowest thou not that your time has come and gone, and that the turn is now ours ? ' He was repeating the very words she had heard the lizards say, and the bats, and the"], [268, "256 THROUGH LOVE TO LIIE creeping things about the ruins. Was he too born of corruption ? ' Thou art going to be beautiful,' he con tinued, using the form of address of an acknow ledged superior, and now rising and look ing down, his shadow full upon her. ' Very beautiful, I should say. Well, little one, they gave thee rank, but they did not give thee beauty. And to-day rank is doomed. Trust to the beauty, little one ; there is safety in that.' Kathe neither understood nor could answer him. Suddenly he stooped and took her in his arms. ' Kiss me, little one. Nay, do not turn away thy head. I am fond of thee too, and soon thou wilt be fond of me. I am going to take thee with me.' ' Nay, do not struggle,' he continued, look ing down smilingly on her agonised efforts to"], [269, "IN SCHLOSS MANDELSLOH 257 escape. Soon thou wilt love me, and I am going to save thee from their fate. Besides, this too will be a punishment \u2014 a short pre lude to the greater punishment hereafter.' But now the spell was partly broken, and Kathe's wild scream had rung out into the air before he could stop it with his hand upon her mouth. A moment later, and, half-unconscious, she heard Ino's furious bark and the lash of a horsewhip. Then Joi-g, their sole retainer, was beside her, and her grandfather had her in his arms again. She was saved, and the mysterious stranger gone. That very afternoon a stout ancestral rod \u2014 always hung, a perpetual warning, by the side of the rarely-used Kamin \u2014 was put into requisition, in spite of the tears and entreaties of the mother.

And this is the first picture which stands out in the Countess's memory, eternally al fresco, painted there by terror, pain, and mortification ; the mortification greatly en hanced by the commiseration of the maidens and tender-hearted Jorg. The second picture is painted in livelier colours, and sunshine from a cloudless sky streams upon the canvas. It was Hochsommer, and the limes, heavy with blossom, filled the air with fragrance, while a few nightingales still warbled their love-songs among the foliage. And it was Jorg's wedding-day. Linda, one of the maidens at the Schloss, was the happy bride, and the little Countess thought that anything more lovely was no where to be found."], [271, "IN SCHLOSS MANDELSLOH 259 Her embroidered bodice was tightly laced over an ample bosom, harbouring nothing but good-will. Her long flaxen hair, well oiled, was tightly braided. Her round blue eyes twinkled perpetually between smiles and tears, and her plump cheeks were as red as peonies ; almost as red as the ribbons which fastened her hair. She wore a short, narrow petticoat, hardly reaching to her knees, and revealing garters, wonderfully embroidered, on legs that would have done honour to a Scotch Highlander. Upon her head, gorgeous and indescribable, sat a crown fit for a queen. Nobody but an Altenburgerin could have worn it without suffer ing martyrdom, but Linda was used to carry ing heavy pails of water on those fair plaits of hers, and could dance you a jig into the bargain without spilling a drop. The Countess always remembered the walk to the village church through the crowd of 8 2"], [272, "260 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE admiring spectators, and the intoxicating scent of the limes. ' They always smell strongest before a storm,' someone whispered, and Kathe looked up to the serene blue sky, with wonder at the remark. There was plenty of laughing and feast ing and dancing and merriment that evening in the usually silent great dining-hall of the castle, and it might have been only the little Countess's fancy that she saw scowling brows, and heard muttered menaces through the music. It was her own little mother who carried her to bed that night. ' When shall I be married, my Mut terchen ? ' the child asked, while the Countess plaited and brushed her thick golden hair. ' God forbid that thou shouldst ever marry,' said the lady, pressing the child's head to her bosom, upon which a hot tear fell."], [273, "IN SCHLOSS MANDELSLOH 261 ' Why do you weep, my little mother ? ' asked the wondering child. ' Does marriage hurt, like my grandfather's Birkenruthe ? ' But the lady only wept more and did not answer, and the sandman came and weighted the child's eyes and ears till she could neither see nor hear. Now for the third and last picture in the old ancestral Schloss. Kathe was too young to notice how her grandfather's health was failing. She only remembered how querulous he grew, and how anxious for news from France. She only re membered how he used to sit there muttering, while her mother grew paler and paler. Sometimes the old Count would seem to confound the grandchild with her mother, calling her Theda, her mother's name, and summoning her to his side. ' I am only Kathchen, grandpapa.' ' Kathchen ? Who is she ? It was a boy"], [274, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 262 I wanted, yet I grew to love my daughter above all things. She was the apple of my eye, mein Herzblditchen. Ah, she is lost to me ! ' And he would sink into reverie, from which he would rouse up furious, cursing someone for having thwarted his desire. ' To marry him, the base-born foreigner ! Go ! I know thee no more.' Then he would add proudly : ' But he acknowledged the claim. For more than once I stood between him and death. Once in the grand-ducal forest in Sachsen Meiningen, when I rushed between him and the infuriated boar. Once again, when I received the ball levelled at the monarch.' And he would add : ' Forget the other name, my Theda. It is thine no longer. For he, wiser gnddigste Kbnig, has granted my request for thee and for thy heirs. Thou wilt remain Countess"], [275, "IN SCHLOSS MANDELSLOH 263 of Mandelsloh. I have the royal letters patent.' All of which the child could not under stand, but infinitely dreaded. The red sun was slowly sinking in the west, and the evening meal over. And now Jorg and Linda brought out the spinning-wheels for the evening task. The old Count had supped heavily, for the supper had consisted of his Leibgericht \u2014 Puffer (potato-cakes baked in oil and served hot and crisp), salad made from the celery-root, and stewed plums from the orchard, gathered and dried in the autumn. He was now lying on the Kanape at the far end of the hall, breathing heavily and ster torously. ' Go and kiss the dear hand of thy grand father, my child,' said the grave Countess of Mandelsloh. ' I will take thee to thy rest.' The whirr of the spinning-wheels made a sort of dreamy music, which mingled"], [276, "264 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE not discordantly with the deep breathing of the old man upon the couch ; and outside, Ino's deep bay was heard from time to time. The child never forgot the mingling of these sounds and the sensations they awakened. And now the maids began to sing : 'Sgibt nur 'ne Kaiser-Stadt, 'Sgibt nur 'ne Wien. Alas, how heavily it had nearly cost them, that leaning of Protestant Saxony and her Catholic king towards the soft, sensuous arms of demoralised Austria ! ' Now, my Herzchen,' said the Countess, ceasing her spinning, which she had been doing with two hands at once, unlike the maids, who only span with one; while she moistened her thread in a basin at her side, they using a handier moisture, afforded by their own mouths. ' Now, my Herzchen, thy time is un.'"], [277, "IN SCHLOSS MANDELSLOH 265 Thine too, gentle little lady, thine too, on earth ! For what were those shadows on the floor, thrown there by the rising moon ? And what was the meaning of that loud cry from the maidens ? And now Ino's fierce, furious bark died away in a howl of mortal agony. The child had no time to scream, for her mother's hand was on her mouth, and her mother's sweet voice was saying resolutely, ' Remember that thou art a Man delsloh, little Kathe.' And now the thicken ing shadows grew into stalwart men, and stood armed around them. They were all peasants from the village. Kathe knew them all, yet knew them not, for they were strangely altered. They bowed no knee before the Herrschaften, nor stood aside to let them pass. They had been re created since yesterday. They had become men."], [278, "266 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE Men like unto themselves. The old Count \u2014 a moment before weak. helpless, and almost unconscious on the Kanape \u2014 rose to meet them as quietly as if they had only come at his summons to receive ' gracious punishment.' His glazed and dimmed eye grew bright and keen, as he drew himself up to his magnificent height and stood facing them. One of the troop, a huge peasant, advanced towards him. The child never forgot the look on her grandfather's face as he stood confronting them \u2014 one against a hundred. The velvet cap had fallen from his white head ; a won derful light irradiated his massive features ; his lip was defiantly curled. And he seemed to say, ' This is the work for which I was born \u2014 to suppress such as these. Let me die with my foot in the stirrup.'"], [279, "IN SCHLOSS MANDELSLOH 267 ' What is the meaning of this, Johann Faullenzer ? ' he asked haughtily. ' Has he forgotten the time, long years ago, when he was brought before me to be chastised? Do his scars want renewing ?

' He has a good memory,' answered the Count, as coolly as if no hundred armed men \u2014 armed with the weapons of revolt : flails, hoes, spades, rakes \u2014 stood behind ; 'it is exactly, as he says, forty years ago.' There were muttered curses to be heard as he spoke, and the men behind pressed hard upon their leader, while a humpbacked cripple, mounted upon the Countess's spinning wheel and armed with her basin, made as if"], [280, "268 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE he would have hurled it at the resolute white head of the speaker. Johann's big bulldog face paled a little. The old Count proceeded : ' Could he not learn the lesson taught him ? Does he want it repeated ? ' ' It has been learned, Graf Mandelsloh. Ay, and taught to others as well. And we are come here to-night \u2014 that's what we are come for, Herr Graf \u2014 to reward our teacher. Gott hob' ihn selig ! ' ' Gott hab' ihn selig ! ' repeated the others. And the cripple in the rear laughed, a shrill ' he ! he ! he ! ' of scorn and mockery. ' I was then only twenty years old, Graf Mandelsloh, and had been taught that I owed love and obedience to the hohen Herrschaften. I was willing to learn. I owed them no grudge then.

And for that, Herr Graf, you condemned me to the lash and to the dungeon.' ' Wilddiebe must be punished,' said the old Count, somewhat uneasily. ' Freili, freili, Count Mandelsloh, and Bauernmadel must die. Aennchen drowned herself, foolish Dime, in despair at my dis grace. And my love and respect for the hohen Herrschaften were turned to hate.' The old Count was silent. ' A drowned Bauernmadel ; ein unter drlicktes Volk ; a whipped Bauer ; what is that to the hohen and the hbchsten Herr schaften ?

'He ought to know, knowing so much,' said the Count, ' that the cellars in Schloss Mandelsloh have been drained dry long ago, and that our Feldbett is harder than his own.' ' Knock him down, Johann ! ' shrieked the cripple. ' Tell him that in another hour the Red Cock, the banner of the people, will be seen far and wide, floating from the turrets of Schloss Mandelsloh. Hurrah ! the harvest is there, and Johann, sickle in hand, at the head of the reapers.' Then there was an onward rush, the old Count still standing erect as long as his grand daughter could see him. After this, the picture grows confused and dim.

There they halted. Besides the man who called himself the child's father, and who, as she learned after wards, really was her father, were two other men, dark-haired, close-shaven, and fierce-eyed. Of these men she felt afraid, although they rarely noticed her, mostly passing her by in sullen silence except when she was in their way. And then they would push her aside as if she had been an insensate log, with a muttered curse. There was also a woman, and she too was dark-haired and fierce-eyed.

Sometimes the terrified child witnessed hor rible scenes between them. Occasionally the passionate words of the woman would rouse her companion's wrath, and once roused it knew no limit. He would beat her cruelly. At other times he would caress and fondle her, and then to please him she would caress and fondle the child, calling her ' petit ange,' and the like, and declaring she was the image of her father, the most beautiful of men.

But she bore with him, forgave him, until the final offence which struck at the root of her one virtue and turned the fountain of her love into a deadly poison. Even then she shared his fate, dying upon his bosom. The storm-tossed hearts of the people had finally beaten themselves numb against the iron barriers forged by wealth and power."], [296, "284 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE They grew quiet at last. New voices, loudest among them Monsieur l'Anglais's, were heard in the streets and in the faubourgs. ' Vive Napoleon!' succeeded to, and finally over powered, ' Vive la Revolution I ' So it was that the fruit he lusted for ripened under the sunny sky of France, and when the ex-prisoner of Ham landed at Boulogne, it was with a sigh of satisfaction that many a weary heart in the capital heard of the eagle which had flown to meet him and settled on his head. ' An omen from above,' they cried, for Paris longed to feel the pressure of a firm heel again. She had had ' assez des revo lutions.' 'It is a sign from above, Hortense,' Monsieur l'Anglais had said, forestalling the people. ' Vive Napoleon ! ' ' Thou wouldst cry, thou, \" Vive le bon Dieu I \" if Satan ceased to be of service to thee,'"], [297, "LOUIS L'ANGLAIS 285 answered Hortense. ' There is not a drop of true blood in thee, Louis. But what about the bacon in the Prince's hat ? ' she continued, ' and who tamed the eagle ? ' And she laughed, the hysterical laugh of a wounded heart. But why follow the details of this ever recurring strife? Soon the little Countess, by the mercy of God, was removed into a healthier atmosphere. The coup d'etat, which speedily followed the proclaiming of the third Napoleon as President of the Republic, raised Louis l'Anglais to a very different position. He no longer lived in a remote street, but in the centre of one of the great boulevards, where Hortense, now called Madame l'Anglais, ' entertained ' to her heart's content. Nay, more than this. For some unex plained service Louis l'Anglais was ennobled by a grateful Emperor, and received the title"], [298, "286 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE of Comte de Grise. He had worn grey on the occasion when he met a grtater adven turer than himself on the pier at Boulogne, and had been jocularly accosted by him as Monsieur Couleur de Gris. Hence his title. But poor Hortense never rose beyond Madame l'Anglais. Many of the greatest gentlemen of the new court came to her receptions, but the ladies accompanying them had nothing wherewith to reproach their hostess. She was to the full as honourable as they. Now, as only child of the Comte Louis de Grise, and also, by virtue of royal letters patent, Countess of Mandelsloh in her own right, it became necessary to care a little for Kathe's education. She was sent to a convent school. Fortunately the choice was a good one. The little Countess received excellent teaching"], [299, "LOUIS L'ANGLAIS 287 and made rapid progress. Several peaceful and happy years succeeded. And so she grew into a tall demoiselle of seventeen. One morning she was hastily summoned to the Lady Superior. She obeyed without emotion. The current of her life had flowed so peacefully of late that the painful recollec tions of her murdered mother and grand father and the horrible life she had led afterwards were partially obliterated. It was a letter from her father which awaited her. It commanded her instant return. With a trembling heart she obeyed. She had not seen him since she had left him for the convent. But with the proud resolution which was an integral part of her character, she kissed her companions, embraced the Lady Superior, and, accompanied by one of the sisters, returned to Paris. There the sister left her."], [300, "288 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE The Count Louis de Grise was alone in his grand hotel, lying upon a silken couch ; his golden hair damp and tangled, his blue eyes bloodshot and haggard.

' She was an angel,' answered his daughter, roused by the strength of her love. And his cruel words did what the kind ones at the convent had failed to do \u2014 they loosed the iron bands round her heart, and she wept. ' Sit down,' he said, disregarding her emotion.

' Didst thou ever dream that thou wast dead ? That all was over ? That superior cunning could avail thee no more ? ' ' No, I never dreamed that.' ' Oh, it was horrible.

His daughter stood aloof, aghast that not one impulse in her tempted her to approach him nearer. He went on : ' I dreamed that I was dead, yet, though I was powerless to move, I could both see and hear. ' And I saw a woman standing beside me, a little woman with a face like mine and thine, only not so beautiful. And I could see right through this woman into her heart, and it was white as snow.' His daughter still stood aloof, gazing at him. And he trembled as he returned her gaze, seeming to see something terrible even in the frightened eyes of his child. He went on slowly, speaking as if in self-communing : 'Then I saw in the centre of that pure heart one bleeding spot.

Where she had stood something was lying on the ground, covered with a cloth. ' I drew off the cloth and looked, and it was an image of myself, the face white and ghastly, the golden hair red with blood.' The colour had died out of his face as he spoke, and his eyes grew fixed and glassy. ' I forgot,' he said hoarsely ; ' I forgot that I must die.'

I am going to be married. Canst keep a secret, child ? And Hortense is gone ; she shall not ill-treat thee any more.' He said this as if he had made a sacrifice of her for his daughter's sake, playing the old double game even with his own soul. Then he added, hardly conscious that he was giving himself the direct lie : ' It is she who is dead. She grew old and ugly, child, and her tears wearied me.' He then bade his daughter fetch a casket from an adjoining table. 'See,' he said, 'this is for thee, Kathe. There are a few things in it that will be of"], [305, "LOUIS L'ANGLAIS 293 value to thee.

Now this horror was deepened by a vague impression that someone else was listening too. The curtain at the head of his couch moved slightly ; the air seemed suddenly suffused with a sulphurous vapour. Almost choking, she hurried away. The Count sank back again upon his silken couch. He had talked away his fear and his remorse. His lips smiled. His blue eyes sparkled. His attitude was full of voluptuous ease.

In his own magnificent hotel, Louis, Comte de Grise, had been found dead in the arms of a woman \u2014 a mistress whom he had abandoned.

After the state of bodily and mental in capacity which succeeded her father's death, Katherina, Countess of Mandelsloh, found herself almost destitute. Her father's goods were claimed by creditors. Her letters to London were returned to her by the post officials. She wrote to the Lady Superior of the convent where she had been educated, but she was dead.

She had been struggling with her fate until, like a little bird in the snare of the fowler, she was getting worn out with the struggle. Nothing seemed left but the cruel waters of the lake, and her young life shrank from that alternative.
