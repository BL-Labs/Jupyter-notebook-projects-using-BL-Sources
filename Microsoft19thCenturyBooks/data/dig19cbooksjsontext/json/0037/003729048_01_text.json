Treasury Department, April 1, 1868. Sir : An appropriation having been made by Congress to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to collect reliable statistics of the mineral resources of the United States, a special appointment was conferred upon Mr. J. Boss Browne, under which he performed this service in the States and Territories west of the Rocky mountains. To Mr. James W. Taylor the duty of collecting similar statistics east of the Rocky mountains was assigned. The position held by Mr. Browne having become vacant, and it being in the opinion of tfie department important that the work should be con tinued, you have this day been appointed a special commissioner for the collection of statistics in the western division above specified. A copy of the instructions under which Mr. Browne performed his duties is herewith enclosed. Laasmuch as his preliminary report, printed by Congress in 18G7, and his subsequent report for 1868, now in the hands of the public printer, cover the material points embraced in the instructions, it will be unneces sary for you to enter into similar investigations in detail, except in cases where omissions may have occurred, or where the information obtained may appear to be erroneous or imperfect. The most importa_at subjects for inquiry at present seem to be \u2014 First. As to the different processes of treating the ores, their chemical combinations, and the system demonstrated by practical experience to be the most successful. Second. The relative merits of the various inventions, machines, and mechanical contrivances now in use or projected for the reduction of the precious metals, and for all other purposes connected with the busi ness of mining and metallurgy. Third. The special needs of the great mining interest, how it can be encouraged and rendered most productive, how far individual enterprise should be left untrammelled by legislative action, and to what extent and in what instances government might properly lend its aid to facilitate the development ofthe mines aud thus arrest the present annual decrease in the production of bullion. Fourth. What has been the experience of other countries, resulting from the establishment of national institutions for the education of miners, and how far would the systems prevailing in Europe be appli cable to our people or appropriate under our government ? General suggestions of this kind cannot of course always be implicitly carried out, but it is expected that your scientific and practical experience will enable you to furnish valuable information on the subjects indicated. It will be necessary, in the performance of the duties assigned to you, that you should visit in person the principal States and Territories embraced within your division. You will be pleased to submit your report to this department on or before the first day of October next. I am, verv respectfully, ' \" HUGH McCULLOCH, Secretary of the Treasury. E. W. Eaymond, Esq., Hew Yor% City."], [12, ""], [13, "LETTER FROM EOSSITER W. RAYMOND, COMMISSIONER FOR THE COLLECTION OF MINING STATISTICS, TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY Washington, D. C, January 18, 1869. Sir : The report which I have the honor to transmit herewith is mainly my own work. At the time when I received my appointment as Com- missioner of Mining Statistics, there was but a small remnant of previous appropriations left in the treasury which could be applied to the work with which I was charged. Preferring to go into the field as soon as possible, and prepare myself by personal observation for my task, I decided, with your approval, not to wait for the necessary appropriation, but to use the money already applicable, to enable me to see as much as possible of the districts within my department. I am happy to say that by the almost universal courtesy of railway, steamboat, stage, and express companies, my expenses of travel were much reduced, and I was able, with the small sum at my disposal, to complete during the summer a journey of some 13,000 miles. In this connection it is my duty especially to acknowledge the interest manifested in my mission, and the facilities put at my disposal by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, the North American Steamship Company, the California Steam Navigation Com- pany, the Union Pacific Eailroacl Company, the Central Pacific Eailroad Company, and Wells, Fargo & Co. The lack of means put it beyond my power to engage competent assist- ants, or even to employ a clerk for tabulating and calculating statistics. Obliged to do the whole work myself, I am nevertheless indebted to numerous gentlemen of the States and Territories I visited for their hearty sympathy and assistance, and feel bound to mention particularly the members of the California Academy of Sciences, Mr. Sherman Daj*, Mr. Titus Cronise, Mr. William Ashburner, and Mr. Henry Janin, of San Francisco; Messrs. Watt, Grossman, Lee, Merchant, and others, superin- tendents at Grass Valley; Messrs. Brumagim, connected with the Mari- posa company; Mr. A. P. E. Safford, United States surveyor general, Mr. Louis Janin, and Mr. C\u00e6sar Luckhardt, of Virginia City; Messrs. Boalt, Stetfeldt, and Eiotte, of Austin ; Messrs. Eaton, Keyes, Be Lacy, and others, of Montana. Many of these gentlemen put themselves to trouble and expense to further my objects; some of them furnished me with valuable information, which will be found credited to them in the proper place. Under these circumstances, the report now presented is necessarily partial. I have not attempted to make it comprehensive, at the cost of accuracy. It contains my own observations and such others as I have"], [14, "4 resources of states and territories collected from perfectly trustworthy sources. Many papers promised to me, which I would be glad to have included in it, have not yet arrived ; and as the writers are under no obligation but that whicii their own courtesy imposed, I cannot well hurry or blame them. The report is in two parts, the first containing such observations of the present condition of our mining industry as I could collect, and the second discussing at considerable length the subjects involved in the relation of the govern ment to that industry. The subject of methods and processes of mining and reduction I have entirely postponed, proposing to treat it in my next report with more care and thoroughness than would have been possible in the brief period, and with the limited means, at my disposal last year. I hope to be able to present such a description and discussion of the different methods and apparatus used or proposed in this country as will be of practical value, not only as a means of determining the progress of the country in these respects, but also as a convenient summary for the benefit of the mining communities, and the great number of our citizens directly or indirectly interested in mining and metallurgy. As my object has been to make a plain and simple statement, I have avoided, as far as possible, the use of technical or obscure terms, using only, I believe, such as can be found in the ordinary English dictionaries, or readily explain themselves from the context. There are also introduced a few sketches of underground workings, selecting* such mines as were capable of being represented by simple profiles. These profiles are taken on the plane of the rein, (local irregularities being disregarded,) and show the quantity of ground already excavated, and the quantity remaining, either unopened or so far opened as to come under the head of \" reserves,\" which includes the portions of a vein where \"stoping,\" or extracting ore, may at once be commenced, the preparatory shafting and drifting (or opening of galleries) being complete. The Eureka mine, of Amador county, California, and the Social and Steptoe mine, of Egan caiion, Nevada, are examples, in whicii the amount of reserves, or ground opened in advance, is very large. Many of the Grass Valley mines are charac terized by the same peculiarity, as the sketches show; and iu this case, the prudence of the management is worthy of high praise, since the Grass Valley veins are narrow and hard, and the maintenance of large reserves is a matter of difficulty and expense. I ought to add that many mines of celebrity and interest are not represented by sketches, not because I desired to omit them, but because (as is the case with the Com stock mines) they could not be shown in simple profile, or because the expense of makiug the necessary measurements aud drawings (in cases where none were accessible to me) was greater than I felt justified in assuming, or finally, because the character of the underground workings was so irregular and unskilful as to confer no credit upon the owners, and convey no instruction to the public. The bullion product of the present year is more difficult to be esti mated than that of almost any preceding one. The bullion tax having been abolished, the best source of knowledge on the subject is taken away. Wells, Fargo, & Co.'s express returns, which have hitherto been an important aid in estimating the movement, and thus the product, of bullion on the Pacific coast, have lost their comprehensive character by the establishment of a rival express company (the Union Pacific,) the amount of the business of whicii is said to be considerable, but has not been, to my knowledge, thus far authoritatively reported. From the best"], [15, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 5 authorities, and such official returns as I can collect, I estimate the pro duct of the whole country as follows : California $22,000,000 Nevada 14,000,000 Montana 15,000,000 Idaho 7,000,000 Washington and Oregon 4,000,000 Arizona 500,000 New Mexico 250 000 Colorado aud Wyoming 3,250000 All other sources l',OOo'<) 00 67,000,000 This is a decrease of $8,000,000* from the product of 1867, which showed a falling off of some $8,000,000 as compared with that of the year before. Montana, Idaho and Colorado manifest a satisfactory im provement ; but there is a decrease of $5,000,000 from California, and $6,000,000 from Nevada, the latter being due to the exhaustion of many of the Comstock ore-bodies. It is an instructive fact that the greater part of the product from deep mining is furnished by the same mines this year as last year and the year before, indicating* that a more general adoption of systematic and economical methods would result in greater stability of production. The yield from placer mining must be expected to decrease, and its place must be supplied by the cement and quartz mines. The causes of the decrease in our production of bullion may be enumerated as follows : 1. The exhaustion of many surface deposits. 2. The reaction following upon a period of excited speculation, and the collapse of numerous dishonest schemes. 3. The increasing and novel difficulties attendant upon the manage ment of deep mines and the reduction of refractory ores. 4. The lack of communications, capital and knowledge, such as are required for the creation of enterprises based on the extraction and reduction of ores of low grade in large quantity \u2014 the only stable form of mining. 5. The vexatious and ruinous litigation which waits upon mining on the public domain, and which is most troublesome aud expensive where mining is, in other respects,, most profitable \u2014 thus operating to destroy those enterprises which have overcome other difficulties. All these may be summed up in one sentence. Mining has been found in too many instances to be unprofitable ; and the individuals who have lost money have retired from the business. It certainly is not the duty ofthe government to give bounties to bolster up mining industry, if that industry is by the nature of the case an unprofitable one. Yet it cannot be denied that the decrease of the product of gold and silver in this country is a matter which particularly concerns the government at this time ; and it may well be inquired, whether the causes of it are reme diable. I believe that time will remove many of them, and that the action of the government, based upon a just appreciation of its relations to the mining industry, will do away with the rest. Concerning the extent of our \"mineral resources,\" the half has never been told; but those resources are but one factor, which must be joined with labor and * Part of this apparent decrease may be accounted for by tbe item of $5,000,000 iu Mr. Browne's estimate from \" unknown sources,\" which I have reduced to $1,000,000."], [16, "6 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES, ETC intelligence to make the product wealth. When the industry of mining in these rich fields is based upon a foundation of universal law, and shaped by the hand of educated skill, we may expect it to become a stately and enduring edifice, not a mere tent, pitched to-day aud folded to-morrow. This industry has been the pioneer in our far western terri tory. It has founded States, attracted population, enlarged the bound aries of civilization ; and it has done this great work iu a lawless and careless way, without much regard to the future. All other parts of society springing from it, are gradually becoming systematized aud con solidated, but the primitive industry remains in its primitive condition. Establishing everything else, it has not established itself. I believe that with the extension of the government surveys over the public domain, and the reduction of its vast area to order and law, the consolidation aud definite adjustment of the miniug interests will become imperatively necessary ; and inasmuch as mining outruns all other activities in our new territories, and needs more than any other the aid of judicious legis lation, I believe it should receive immediate attention. I may venture to hope that the views and suggestions contained in the following- pages, based as they are upon much personal observation, experience and study, will not be without value to the government and the country.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRESENT CONDITION AND PROSPECTS OF THE MINING INDUSTRY."], [18, ""], [19, "SECTION I. NOTES ON CALIFORNIA. CHAPTER I. NEW ALMADEN QUICKSILVER MINES. The traveller visiting these mines leaves San Erancisco by rail for San Jose, a pleasant city at the southern end of the bay. At several inter vening* stations and along the road may be observed the good effects of irrigation, in beautiful gardens and orchards. At one place, a magnifi cent stream of water is supplied by an artesian well. The numerous windmills used for the elevation and distribution of water are a most picturesque feature in the landscapes of California, and might be intro duced with advantage in many older States, perhaps for other purposes than those of irrigation. The boring of artesian wells is doubtless des tined to be widely practiced, since there are few countries where they are rendered at once so necessary by climatic conditions, and so success ful by topographical features. The valleys along the mountain ranges aud their foot-hills do not receive, in surface streams, an adequate pro portion of the water which so vast a mountain area must collect, partly because the excessive evaporation dries up the streams, and partly because they sink into the sandy soil. But the water thus apparently lost in the earth can be recovered by artesian borings, in which it fre quently rises in vast volume and force. Wells judiciously located in such a region could hardly fail to be perennial fountains. In fact, the disappearance of water by sinking, which seems at first sight a great disadvantage to the country, is probably the means of preserving for man that necessary moisture without which the land would remain a desert, as it appeared, in many places, to the eyes of its discoverers. If the rivers ran in tight channels, doubtless this dry and ever-shifting air would carry away the last drop of their moisture, and deposit it in the sea, or on remote mountain summits out of reach. The mines of New Almaden are about 13 miles from San Jose, in the Coast range. The drive thither, through the valley, and winding up among the hills, is beautiful in the extreme. There is a good deal of timber along the road \u2014 that is, a good deal for California. The valley looks like some large park. Magnificent oaks overshadow the smooth wide road ; great gardens and wheat fields, such as never Atlantic States dreamed of, border it on either hand. The distant mountains, seeming near at hand through the clear air, are constant companions of the jour ney. New Almaden itself is, perhaps, the prettiest spot for residence in all California. The mines and furnaces have been frequently described. At the time of my visit the ore from the deepest and newest labores was among the best that I saw ; and the prospects for suture production were as good as ever. There is quicksilver, irregularly distributed, at so many points in the Coast range, that the business of mining and reducing the ores would be open to ruinous competition, but for the peculiar commercial status of the question. As, from time to time, quicksilver mines are"], [20, "10 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES offered for sale in New York, and many persons imagine that this branch of mining involves large, prompt, and sure profits, it will be worth while, perhaps, to exhibit the commercial aspect of the question for the benefit of the public. The quicksilver trade of the world is substantially an armed truce be tween Spain and California. The mine of Old Almaden, in Spain, sup plies the market of London and a large part of Europe, and ships its product as far west as the city of Mexico. Until recently, it also con trolled the great Chinese market, but Mr. Butterworth, shipping 10,000 flasks to Hong Kong, and selling at far below the cost, forced the re-ship ment to Spain of all the Spanish quicksdver ; and the market has since been in his hands. The same tactics on the part of Spain keep him from the London market ; and the two great producers are thus forced to divide the world between them. But the New Almaden company is not the only producer of quicksilver in California, and is obliged for self-preservation to accede to a combination with the New Idria and the Redington ; and it is this combination which now controls the produc tion of quicksilver, and will probably, for a long time to come, prevent the successful establishment of any rival enterprise. It must be borne in mind that the consumption of this metal is limited. A certain amount for manufactures, a certain amount for metallurgical purposes, and the diminishing quantity required for calomel, with what the Chinese manufacture into vermilion, comprise the principal demands. Now, the quantity used in metallurgy, which is the most considerable, is hardly affected by the price of mercury. If it were $1 a pound instead of 60 cents, there would be no less consumed ; if it were 25 cents, the. demand would scarcely increase. In fact, the cost of quicksilver lost in amalgamation is (to wasteful men, like our mill-men) very trifling. In Mexico, where the patio process is employed, perhaps a pound and a half of quicksilver is lost for every pound of silver extracted ; but in Washoe the loss is (I am told) not more than a third as much. The Pacific States aud Territories require altogether about 1,200 flasks, or 91,800 pounds per month ; Mexico and South America, 1,000 flasks each ; China, 1,000. The total annual demand does not exceed 50,000 flasks, the production of which is divided among different companies as follows : New Almaden, 21,000 ; New Idria, 10,000 ; and Redington, 10,000. These three companies have agreed to confine themselves to the above limited amounts (the Avorks at New Almaden, for instance, are only run to half their capacity to furnish the allotted 21,000 flasks) and to buy up the quicksilver made by all other companies. There are a number of smaller mines, like those of Guadalupe, which I visited, about eight miles from New Almaden, and which produce perhaps 150 flasks monthly. All these mines are forced to sell to the before-mentioned combination, which pays them 10 cents a pound, and sells to the public at 60. This margin of profit may seem excessive, but it must be remembered that the returns from sales are extremely slow. The metal is sent to distant agents, and must be sold at retail before the money is received by the producer. It takes perhaps two years to work off the whole of one annual crop. With money at two per cent, a month, this delay is serious. The present combination, which includes the Barrons, (who were in a certain degree forced to go into it, to save their profits on a large amount of quicksil ver, which they had scattered through the western hemisphere at the expiration of their well-known contract with New Almaden,) is able to command foreign capital at comparatively low rates; and hence can afford to wait for the slow remuneration of the trade."], [21, "11 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS, The following is the number of flasks of quicksilver (76\u00a3 pounds each) produced at the New Almaden mines, California, during* the year 1868 : Flasks.

It is not easy to describe that formation known in this State as the Mother Lode, and extending, it is said, from Mariposa through three counties, into the neighborhood of Placerville. I traversed it through nearly its whole length, and studied with some care its general charac teristics ; but I confess myself puzzled to answer the very first ques tion which arises concerning it, namely, is it a lode at all . In spite of the statements so often and so positively made, there is not the evidence of a continuous outcrop for 60 miles to support that supposition. Fre quently the vein cauuot be found on the surface ; frequently it is \" split up\" (according to theory) into seA*eral branches. Nor haA*e careful sur veys established the identity of the indiA*idual outcrops exposed. In fact all that can be held as proATen is, that there is a certain belt of the slates, within which occur, parallel with the stratification, the outcrops of veins or layers of auriferous quartz, which bear, on the whole, a certain resem blance to each other in general features. Yet eA*en this resemblance is not invariable. Different mines on the Mother Lode haAre different kinds of rock, different quality of quartz, different associated minerals. The Pine Tree and Josephine, adjacent mines, and known to run together, carry distinctly different ores. It is only fair to say, however, that the Mother Lode itself is held by some to be a double vein, the two halves being of different ages, (as is always the case in a double fissure atcui,) and showing, throughout the course, a steady antithesis of character. This question I will not argue. At many points, the double nature of the deposit cannot be recognized. At other points, especially inTuo lumne county, there is a talcose companion vein east of the main quartz deposit, and at the celebrated Amador mine, by Sutler creek, there is a so called boulder vein in the east. It is very difficult to identify these various formations so as toproA*e(whatitis quiteas difficult to disprove) that the Mother Lode is indeed a great master ATein, occupying the cen tral fissure in a system. It is even almost impossible to decide whether the different veins which are included under the one name are really fissure veins. Ashburner hints that they are A'eins of segregation, intercala tions among the slates ; Blake thinks them true fissures, though always or nearly always conformable to the layers of slate. I incline to the latter view, but I cannot bring forward absolute proof of the pre-exist ing fissures. Without any doubt, there are evidences enough of the movement of one wall on the other, of dislocations of vein matter, pro ducing \" slickensides,\" which sometimes run directly across the vein,"], [22, "12 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES The quartz is sometimes (as in the Amador mine) knit to the hanging wall by ribs or cross-flaws of quartz, at right angles to the vein sheet ; and these can be traced into the vein mass. If is hard to explain this without the hypothesis of a fissure gradually filled. \" Horses\" are not uncommon\u2014 another significant fact. The quartz itself has lost the comby structure so often seen in fissure ATeins, and appears dense, lamin ated, and streaked parallel with the Avails. Some of it actually has a cleavage like felspar ; and one intelligent man whom I have met believes most positively that the so-called quartz of the Mother Lode is felspar. He is mistaken. Felspar sometimes appears in these mines ; but it is yellow, not white ; and the gangue is genuine quartz, but quartz whicii has undergone so severe and long-continued a pressure as to lose the traces of its original structure, and receive new peculiarities from cir cumstances. In the Eureka at Grass Valley I saw (and no doubt the same might be observed on the Mother Lode) portions of the Arein Avhere the comby structure coidd still be traced, though with difficulty, in the solid mass of quartz. All these, aud other signs, are interpreted by me to mean \" fissure A-ein.\" If I am right, then the Mother Lode presents to us either a huge continuous fissure, or a succession of similar ones, remarkably regular in strike and dip, and remarkably free from cross-courses or branches. This regularity results, no doubt, from the conform ability of the fis sure or fissures to the slate-strata. But what force could open those strata in such a Avay, to such an extent, and with so little disturbance of the walls, or creation of faults and cross-courses \"? In reply to this question I can only offer a suggestion. Future observation may throw the needed light upon the subject. Let it be borne in mind that the auriferous slates Avhich here flank the Sierra Nevada do not dip AvestAvard, as one would naturally expect them, tilted by the upheaval of that range, to do ; but on the con trary, dip towards the east, at A-arious angles, though in general very steeply. This strange phenomenon, analogous to some Alpine occur rences which long perplexed the geologists ot Europe, finds its probable explanation in the observations made by Professor Whitney, the State geologist, in the ridge between the north and middle forks of the Ameri can riArer. \"This ridge,\" I quote from Cronise's Natural Wealth of California, \" is cut by deep canons or gorges, in one instance 2,000 feet in depth, with sides sloping at as high an angle as 45 degrees. The auriferous slates beneath are sometimes eroded to a depth of 1,500 feet, and peculiar facilities are thus afforded for the study of their structure. It was in this Adcinity that Professor Whitney observed the A*ery inter esting fact, illustrative of the probable fan-like structure of the strata flanking the central portion of the Sierra. These usually show an east erly dip, towards the chain; in these deep A*ertical sections, it was noticed that the upper 1,000 or 1,200 feet had the normal dip to the east, but below this there was a gradual curve, and at the bottom the dip was to the west, as if the upper portion of the strata had been forced back by immense pressure from above.\" If the slates, first lifted on the east by the rising Sierra, were afterwards slowly overborne by its weight, we have precisely the cause requisite for longitudinal Assures on a grand scale. Further speculation would lead us too far. An account of one or two of the principal mines, visited during my examination of the Mother Lode, taken together with the details given in the report of my predecessor (1868, pp. 14-19,) will throAv some light on the nature aud commercial importance of this extensive deposit. The Mariposa mines, Mariposa county, the property of the Mariposa"], [23, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 13 company, are now being worked under a neAv arrangement by the com pany itself. The financial adjustment Avhich has been effected does not come within the province of this report; nor shall I repeat the general description ofthe property, with which the public has been made familiar, but content myself with adding, by way of illustration to what is said in Mr. Browne's last report, (pages 21-30,) two profile sketches of the Josephine and Pine Tree mines, showing their present condition and amount of reserves.

The pro blem here, as everywhere, is the reduction of the second-class ore. By the Eyerson process, the company expects to do this successfully. The working results obtained by that process are giA*en below. The Josephine and Pine Tree are the two mines on which the imme diate development of the Mariposa estate, and the recovery of the com pany's fortunes, depend. The Princeton is iu a bad condition, and would cost too much to reopen and extend ; the Mariposa is for the present exhausted; the Ophir and Green Gulch otter no knoAvn produetiA*e ground.

The ore, however, at the extremity of drift A, yielded $60 per ton. All the aboATe yields, except in a siugle instance, refer to the ordinary process of stamping and amalgamation , as practiced in the two mills on the Merced, known as the Benton mills, and celebrated in California for their cheap crushing and great loss of gold. The Ryerson process of amalgama tion, Avhich has beeu tried for more than a year on the estate, is more expen siAre, but more thorough than that formerly in use ; and for the ore of the Josephine and Pine Tree mines appears to haA*e giAren Arery encouraging results. At the little Bear Valley mill, 1,500 tous of Josephine rock haA*e been reduced, yielding $36,944 83, or $24 66 per ton. When it is remem bered that the Josephine was abandoned because it would not pay $8 per ton at the Benton mills, the gain by the new process is apparent. The ore is first coarsely crushed with stamps, then reduced to powder in reA'olving drums, containing chilled iron balls, about as large as musket balls, and then introduced into a cylinder, in Avhich it is exposed to mercury and steam. The Josephine rock Avorked by this process at Bear Valley is the same in appearance as that which formerly yielded $6 to $8 per ton at the Benton mills. Mr. Hicks, in charge of the Bear Valley mill, thinks the Piue Tree ore still better. Since my visit, the Bear Valley mill has been"], [25, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 15 destroyed by fire, and the company has finished once more the dam across the Merced, and will soon be producing* large amounts of bullion, the Benton mills having been adapted to the Ryerson process.

Water is lifted from this mine in buckets, like those formerly used iu the Hay ward. The heavy gouge along the footwall renders extraction of rock easy, as in the Hayward also, q. v. Mr. Morgan, the superin tendent, states the cost of mining at $3 25, and milling at $1 25, per ton. Giant powder has beeu tried, but not adopted. The circum stances neither require nor favor it. The mine is heavily timbered, and in good condition. The yield of rock in 1867 was $22 per ton ; this year the ATein is broader and not so rich, yielding, on the average, only $16 per ton. The shipments of bullion from this mine were, in March $21,500; in April, $10,500; in May, $18,300, and in the first shipments of June, $10,100 \u2014 the variations being due to the times of cleaning up, once in three weeks, and the aA'erage monthly shipment being $15,000.

This profile is the same as that given in the report of Mr. Bowie, of San Francisco, except that it is not a vertical section, but a map on the vein, showing the amount of grouud open aud the extent of reserves. The far-famed Amador, alias Eureka, alias Hayward's mines, is sit- uated at Sutler creek, in Amador county, on the \"Mother Lode.\" Sutter creek is about 18 miles from Latrobe, a station ou the Sacramento rail- road \u2014 which was intended to run from Sacramento to Placerville, but stopped ingloriously at Shingle Springs, aud now that the Central rail- road has adopted the river route via Dutch Flat, OArer the mountain, may perhaps never get any further. The difference Avhich railroad and river transportation make in some of the incidental expenses of mining opera- tions is illustrated by the fact that freight from San Francisco to Latrobe costs but $5 50 per ton, Avhile the cost from Latrobe to Sutter creek is $12 per ton. The claim now owned by the Amador company is 1,850 feet in length upon the course of the ledge, north 22\u00b0 west. The aArerage dip is 71\u00b0 east, and the width varies from 3 feet to more than 20, being 15 feet in the lower stopes at the present time. Mr. Browne's report, based upon such data as were attainable in June, 1867, represents the main or Eureka shaft to be 1,230 feet in depth. Accurate surA*eys made since that time establish the exact depth as 1,109 feet on the incline, or 1,054 feet vertically. The loAvest level is 1,084 feet on the A*ein, the remaining 25 feet being used as a sump. This was especially required by the system of drainage employed. Up to the present time there have been no pumps in the mine, the water being hoisted in large buckets. Most of the water Avas from the surface. Old exhausted stopes in the upper part of a mine are often ATery trouble- some in collecting Avater and conducting it into the deeper workings, from which it must be hoisted or pumped at considerable expense. Tlie system of bailing instead of pumping is practicable Avhere the water is not too abundant ; aud this was the plan adopted aud obstinately adhered to by Mr. Hayward, as long as he owned and managed Eureka. The system has certain advantages. The plant is inexpensiA*e and easily kept in repair. There is no trouble in sinking deeper, such as the readjust- ment of pumps, or perhaps replacing them with others of larger calibre. The same hoisting gear may raise water part of the time and ore the rest. On the other hand a pump works steadily, without interfering with other operations in the shaft, Avithout constant manual labor in emptying buckets, &c, and is adequate (if selected with proper fore thought) to all the sudden or climatic variations in the quantity of water entering* the mine. The Eureka- mine at its present depth needs two shafts constantly available for hoisting rock. Mr. Hayward's positive ness as to the superiority of buckets, enforced by his great pecuniary success in managing the mine, Avent far to convince many minds that, for this mine at least, pumps Avere not necessary. But Mr. Inch, a very experienced mining captain, now superintendent for the company, no sooner took charge than he determined to change the system of drainage. He will run a drain-tunnel near the surface to catch the water on the vein and keep it out of the loAver leA-els ; aud the drainage in depth Avill be effected by means of pumps, to be placed in the south or Badger shaft, (now being deepened for the purpose,) while the Eureka and middle shafts will be devoted to hoisting rock. This is true economy. It is possible that the popular reports that the profits of this mine amount to $50,000 monthly, were at oue time true. But it is difficult to arrive at a just estimate of such a point, without considering the condi tion in which the mine and mills are kept. About the first of Mtirch last H. Ex. Doc. 54 2"], [28, "18 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES Havward & Company sold the property to the Amador company for about $750,000. (The Amador company which was formed in October, 1867, seems to have been merely Haywood & Co. under a new name.) The production of the mine for several months preceding and following this transfer is as follows : October. Production '. $38,371 00 Expenses 14,123 04 Profit 24,247 96 NoA*ember.

There were 3,700 shares, the par value of which was $400. The dividends were $6 per share monthly, or 18 per cent, annually on the capital stock, yet the mine was sold at $200 per share. This is a fact which eastern capitalists would do well to ponder. In the San Francisco market, where the value of mines is best under stood, the stock of an active, successful mine is not intrinsically worth par, unless it is paying from 30 to 40 per cent, annually. In other words, a mine earning profit at the rate of $300,000 per annum is worth in cash, under the most favorable circumstances, only $750,000. I say \"under the most favorable circumstances,\" for it is not often that a mine is sold while it is in good paying condition, with ample promise for the future. When mine-owners look forward to selling they are apt to neglect the necessary preparatory work for the future, to make old timbers, old ropes, aud old machinery last a little longer, and in every way to get as much immediate profit, and postpone as much inevitable expense, as possible. This was sadly true of the Mariposa mines. And, to a certain extent, it may be said of the Hayward. The new company has spent a good deal of money in repairs, and will have to spend more in necessary improvements. But the mine itself was well opened. Messrs. Ashburner and Jauin, two of the most careful and impartial engineers on the Pacific slope, examining the property for the purchasers, measured tlie quartz in the slopes, calculated its value from the actual returns of large amounts worked in the mills, and computed the total reserves in sight at 108,027 tons, with a gross value of $1,778,366* The cost of mining and milling does not exceed $6 per ton, leaving au apparent profit of $1,130,204.

At the present rate of about 2,000 tons a month, it would take some five years to exhaust the ore actually in sight and ready for extraction.

The Eureka mine, the foremost in California, is described in Mr. Browne's report, page 130. At the time of my visit in July, there were 122 men at Avork in the mine, and 21 in the mill, besides 19 surface hands, and five in the sulphuret works. Average Avages were, at the sulphuret works, $2 75 daily ; at the mine, $2 75 above ground, $3 under ground ; foremen under ground $5, shift captains $4. The pro duction Avas 376 tons weekly, yielding $40,000 to $60,000 per month. The mill has 30 stamps, 10 at 700 pounds, dropping 68 per minute, aud 20 at 850 pounds, dropping 60 per minute. The light stamps crushed without a rock-breaker 16 tons daily, and the heavy stamps 40 tons ; the relation between them is, therefore, as 1.6 to 2 in favor of the hea\\*y stamps. A large Varney rock-breaker increases the capacity of the mill 40 tons in six days. Screens, No. 5 Russia-punched, equiv alent to 40 brass wire. The pulp flows over blankets, and the tail ings of these pass through \"Eureka amalgamators;\" the blanket washings are passed through Atwood amalgamators first and Eureka afterward, the Avhole finally passing OArer broad copper-plate sluices into a system of tubs and settlers, Avhence it is finally drawn into large im proAred Stevens buddies, 18 or 20 feet in diameter. The more quickly the sulphurets are concentrated the better, since they lose in specific graATity by oxidation. The last concentration from the buddies is put in a tossing tub, after which it is ready for chlorination. The sulphurets in the Eureka amount to about 1 per cent, of the quartz. In this mine the richer the rock in sulphurets, the richer the sulphurets in gold. The Eureka sulphurets formerly yielded $420 per ton, then $400, then as low as $115, and now $200. Some of this is free gold that escapes the amal gamating apparatus. Mr. William Watt, the ATery able and successful superintendent, and Mr. Deetken, the chemist in charge of the chlorina tion works, say that when the Eureka amalgamator was introduced, the yield of tbe sulphurets in the tailings fell off at once $100 per ton, so much more free gold being saAred in the'first process. The chlorination works of the Eureka mine are under the charge of Mr. G. Deetken, who was the first to introduce the process successfully iu California. In accordance with my resolution to abstain in the present report from all discussion of processes, I postpone the description of chlorination until a future occasion. Statement ofthe Eureka mine, Grass Valley, California, for the year ending September 30, i868. The amount of quartz worked during the year was 15,944 tons. The apparent cost of mining and milling was $12 54 per ton; but as there was an excess last year of 610 tons of quartz on the surface and 500 tons in the mine, the actual cost of working is reduced to $12 44. The appar ent yield for the year is $30 36 per ton; but as $14,000 belonging to last year's account was carried OATer to this year, the actual yield has been $31 24 per ton.

The gross proceeds of bullion from this mine in the sixteen months between July 6, 1867, and NoATember 11, 1868, were $320,390 66. Further particulars are not in my possession. I judge that 50 per cent, of the above sum must haATe been net profit. DiscoAreries of great importance are said to have been made in the mine since my visit to it in July last. The value of the ore was then about $34 per ton, and total cost of mining, milling, superin-"], [36, "26 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES tendence, and interest account, about $12 per ton. The A-ein varies from 10 inches to four feet in width, averaging about 14 to 18 inches. Contracts for mining only are let underground at $1 50 to $2 50 per ton of quartz raised, which seems A*ery reasonable for a narrow A'ein. The arrange ment of pumps to be hereafter employed is a 16-inch plunger from the fifth level up, and lift below, for sinking. This apparatus Avill have a capacity of 1,000 gallons per minute. The maximum of water last winter (a very wet season) was 668 gallons per minute. There were 208 men employed in the mine and mill. The North Star mill now contains 24 stamps, (950 pounds,) with a crushing capacity of 45 tons daily. The power is supplied by a 40-horse power eugine, built in this county, where excellent mining machinery is made. A similar engine in the same building does the mine-pumping. The pulp from the batteries is run over blankets, which are washed every 10 minutes. The Avashings are slowly fed into a close Atwood amalga mator, and run afterwards over riffles with quicksih^er. All tailings are concentrated in Hendy machines. The rock contains five to eight per cent, of sulphurets, of Avhich about four-fifths are saved; buddies Avill be introduced to save the remainder. The sulphurets are sold or Avorked at custom chlorination works in the neighborhood. They yield $80 to $200 per ton, (being* from $4 to $18 per ton of quartz.) The clean-up of the mill, July 8, after 12 days' run Avith 16 stamps, was $22,000, exclusive of sulphurets. This is extraordinary, as it shows an average of $61 per ton, or thereabouts. The high result is due to the occurrence in the lower levels of quartz thickly filled with free gold. EMPIRE MINE, OPHIR HILL, GRASS VALLEY. Profile\u2014 Scale, 300 feet to the Inch.

The following letter was written at my request by Mr. W. A. Skid more, of San Francisco, an intelligent and experienced observer : San Francisco, July 21, 1808. Dear Sir : In accordance with a promise made to you at Grass Valley, I herewith trans mit an account of my observations on my return trip to this place through the \" Blue Lead \" range of Nevada county, Placer county, and the quartz district among the foot-hills near Auburn, Placer county I had only leisure to remain one day at Dutch Flat, one at Gold Run, and one at or near Auburn ; and such information as I can communicate is more the result of previous acquaintance with the country than of present research. Throughout the route traversed as above, I was principally impressed with the decay of the miuing towns and the depopulation of the country. If this should continue in the same ratio as it has progressed since, my first acquaintance with the part of country referred to, (some five years since, ) we will soon have deserted towns and a waste of country torn up by hydraulic washings, far more cheerless in appearance than the primitive wilderness of 1848. The causes for this stagnation and the remedy are subjects for your observation aud reflection. I shall proceed to give the simple facts of the condition of the country. Immediately to the east of the basin in which are situated the towns of Grass Valley and Nevada, is a ridge running nearly north and south, and known ' as Greenhorn mountain. On the east slope of this mountain we find the ancient channel known as the Blue Lead, and on which are situated the towns of Hunt's Hill, Red Dog, You Bet, and Little York, in Nevada county, and the towns of Dutch Flat and Gold Run, in Placer county. The lead referred to is well defined to the north o! Deer creek, Nevada county, and to the south of the North Fork of the American river, in Placer county ; but my remarks apply only to that part of it lying between those streams, some 24 miles in length, but embracing at least three fifths of the mills employed in crushing cement on the Blue Lead. For convenience of description the mining interests of this section may be classed under three headings, viz : hydraulic mining, cement mining, and river sluicing, the latter referring to the washings of the tailings in the present water courses. hydraulic Mining. \u2014 The auriferous deposit of this section is from three-fourths of a mile to one mile in width, and the depth of pay dirt varies from 80 to 180 feet from the surface to a bed of hard, cemented gravel, which is not sufficiently rich to crush under stamps, and too hard to be disintegrated by the force of water. This bed of gravel, some fifty feet in thickness, is underlaid by the peculiar blue cement which gives the channel the name of \" Blue Lead.\" Probably no part of this State has yielded as rich returns to the hydraulic miner as the range here described ; but this kind of mining is now only systematically car ried on in one district on the range, known as Gold Run, Placer county. This district was opened about four years since, and still has enough ground left for two more seasons, exclu sive of the present one. The yield for 1800 of this district alone, about two and a-half miles in length, was estimated by the local bankers at $350,000; for 1807, $500,000. The yield of the present year will not probably exceed $400,000; but this is owing to a miners' strike against the ditch companies, which prevented the early opening of the claims, and not to a deterioration of the character of the auriferous deposit. The present price paid for water in Gold Run district is 17 cents per inch for 24 hours, a reduction of nearly 20 per cent, from prices of previous seasons, but still not enough to satisfy the demands of most of the ground owners, who prefer to await a further reduction. These compauies use from 350 to 000 inches. This water passes out of the gauge, boxes with a pressure of six inches above the feed aperture. The banks here are from 100 to 200 feet in height, and of more uniformly a gold-bearing character than any district now being worked in the State. The tailings from this district run into the North Fork of the American river, and are there lost. In the Nevada county end of the range described, hydraulic mining is still carried on extensively in places, but not with as good results, though water is much cheaper in some cases, being as low as 10 cents per inch for 24 hours. The towns of Hunt's Hill, Red Dog, You Bet, and Little York were formerly the centres of active hydraulic operations ; but this kind of mining is now laboring under the depression incidental to this business throughout the State, though there is still a vast field for it. Cement mining. \u2014 The gold- bearing cement lies next to the bed-rock ofthe ancient stream, and can be worked with profit where the channel has been reached, for a thickness of from 10 to 20 feet, and a width, which varies with the conformation of the channel, of from 20 to 40 feet \u2014 the pay being richest where the channel is narrowest, as a general rule. This channel is, doubtless, as continuous as the auriferous deposits above it, but has only been opened at spots which are designated by the location ofthe towns heretofore named. No branch of mining is attended with more risk and uncertainty than this, but when successful the yield is enormous. This kind of mining will eventually be extensively prosecuted throughout this range, but not until some cheaper process is discovered than the one now in general use that of crushing with stamps. Whether the \" Cox* pan,\" with some improvements, will * A new pan, in which the cemented gravel is broken by revolving arms, and the auriferous cement drops through a grating which retains the barren boulders. The object is to avoid tbe necessity of crushing the whole mass. \u2014 R. W. R."], [41, "31 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. not present the facilities desired, is a question which the experience of this year will decide. It is estimated that a stamp will crush quite as much of the hardest cement as of quartz. The larger boulders are thrown out at the dump-house, where the cement is broken up pre paratory to the cement being fed in the batteries. The gold, being mostly free, is caught in the batteries by amalgamation ; the pulp thence passes over copper plates and in sluices. Without claiming to be an expert in such matters, I have no hesitation in saying that 20 per cent, at least of the fine gold is needlessly wasted and lost, for want of longer sluices and settlers. Probably 33 per cent, of all the gold is lost, as some of it is rusty and needs grinding. Ofthe 17 mills located on this channel, but two are run by steam, the others having water power. One of these claims, which I visited two years since, was being run at an expense, for mill and mine, of $500 per week. This claim was open by a bed-rock tunnel 1,000 feet long, with sufficient fall to drain and carry the cement to a ten-stamp mill run by water power. The receipts ofthe owners, at that time, were not less than $2,500 per week, and it has steadily paid large profits ever since. An adjoining claim was noted for a production of $00,000 in 90 days, about the year 1805. A few miles above I visited a claim which had cost its owners $30,000 without getting any return. This latter claim took out their cement through a shaft 135 feet deep, and were much troubled with water. This mill, (ten-stamps,) hoisting and pumping works, were run by water-power, which alone cost $25 per 24 hours. I learn that they have struck pay dirt this season. The claims in the vicinity of the town of You Bet have proved the richest on the channel. Two and a-half miles southerly of Gold Run the same channel has been found at a point where it crosses the North Fork of the American, or, more properly speaking, where the North Fork has cut through the ancient channel. At this place (Stone's Mill) the bed-rock terminated abruptly, about 1,000 feet above the present level of the water of the North Fork of the American, and the cemented mass was plainly exposed to view. An eight-stamp mill was erected, and the mass worked by breaking it down, having first loosened it by heavy explosions of powder, in drifts run for the purpose. In consequence of the great facilities thus presented, this claim has steadily paid since the commencement of the enterprise. I visited this ground a few days since, while at Gold Run, and do not think they are in the centre ofthe channel, but on a shelf of bed-rock I form this opinion from the absence of the large boulders, petrified treas, brush, sand-banks, &c, usually found in the channel. This channel runs northerly under the Gold Run district to Little York, and perhaps Dutch Flat. Southerly, it makes its appear ance at the same elevation on the opposite bank of the North Fork of the American, near Iowa Hill, from whence it is easily traced for many miles. The town of Dutch Flat, which lies to the north of the Gold Run district, is not on the direct north and south line which the channel seems to follow ; nevertheless deep explorations there this summer have disclosed the presence of the Blue Lead, but whether on a bend of the main channel, or on a feeder or affluent, cannot be positively known. The following are the number of mills and stamps erected on this part of the Blue Lead : Note.\u2014 Of these 164 stamps not more than 80 are running this year. The channel is often said to be \"lost,\" and this accounts for the number of claims lying idle. More properly speaking, they have come upon au unprofitable spot in the channel not favorable to the deposition of gold\u2014 though sometimes it meanders out ofa particular claim. River sluicing. \u2014 The range I have described presents extraordinary attractions for this class of operations, which are now prosecuted but on a limited scale, but destined to become one of the greatest interests of this part of the country, on account of the number of large streams crossing or running parallel with the best miniug ground, and which are filled to a depth of from 30 to 50 feet with the accumulated tailings of 10 years of extensive hydraulic mining. The most prominent of these streams are the Bear river, Steep Hullow creek, and Greenhorn creek ; there are, besides, many ravines and canons, noted tor the extent ot then accumulations and the former rich character of the adjacent ground. In the early days of hydraulic mining, no allowance was made for the existence of fine gold, and this character of wealth was carried off by the strong and rapid streams of water running over the sluice boxes, which were then of a steeper grade and much shorter than those now used ; besides, Locality.

The result was that a large proportion of the gold was lost\u2014 probably one-half\u2014 and now lies on the bottom ofthe streams which were the receptacles of the tailings. A preliminary survey ot Bear river was made several years since with a view to the inauguration of an extensive system of tail-sluicing, but the fall of the stream not being sufficient to carry off the tailings, the pro ject was temporarily abandoned. This object can, however, be accomplished by running a tunnel, a mile and a half in length, through the ridge dividing Bear river from the North Fork of the American, which latter stream is several hundred feet lower than Bear river, and laying the sluice boxes in the bottom of this tunnel. Should the project of Sanford & Co.. of running off the tailings of Greenhorn creek, prove remunerative, this immense work will doubtless be undertaken. Sanford & Co. have purchased and located ten miles of Green horn creek, and commenced putting in their sluice boxes last year. They were much dam aged by the extraordinary high waters of last season, and their experiment has not yet dem onstrated the profit of this class of operations, but practical men express no doubts of their eventual success. Present condition and future prospects.\u2014 If the condition of the mining towns along the route I have laid out is to be taken as a criterion of the mineral wealth of the country, then a very discouraging picture would be presented. But to do this would be to do an injustice to a district which I believe is yet destined, with the aid of capital, to add millions of dollars to our circulating medium. The causes of the decay of those towns are easily found. The large sums of money which the mines have yielded have not been spent here in making homes and opening new channels of mining enterprise, but in the majority of cases the miner, as soon as he made his \"pile,\" has gone elsewhere to spend it. With the new population which thee ountry requires this will not again occur. The soil, which a few years since was thought worthless except for the gold it contained, is now demonstrated to be productive, if not of all the necessities of life, at least of all that make a home luxurious and pleasant. The grape, fruits, and vegetables of all kinds grow here with a profusion elsewhere unknown, and the new class of miners will learn that here they can provide themselves with homes which will make life endurable without the enormous gains expected in early times. Nearly all these towns have, at some period, been destroyed by fire and rebuilt in a day, but now they are suffering from the equally sure but slower ravages of time The town of Red Dog has not one-half its buildings occupied, and at present none ofthe cement mills at that place are running. You Bet still retains some of its former prosperity. Little York has deteriorated nearly as much as Red Dog. Dutch Flat, a few years since, had a population of 2,000 ; at present I should judge the population to be about 1,000. On the main street, here, we find dilapidated sidewalks, vacant hotels and stores, and an occasional ruin of a house which has fallen from the rotting of the timbers which supported it. Hunt's Hill (known in early days as Gouge-Eye) is supported by the cement mills of the Gouge-Eye and eastern companies, whose claims have steadily paid for several years past. Gold Run is the only prosperous town ou the part ofthe Blue Lead range I have visited. This part of the country is now passing through a crisis. It is an interregnum in which mere labor has nearly exhausted its efforts, and capital has not yet come to its assistance. The gold is in the ground, but not so near the surface as to be extracted by mere labor. Enterprises of great magnitude, requiring capital aud engineering skill, must be prosecuted, and when completed this region will enter on a career of prosperity which will last for 20 years or more, and repay their projectors 100-fold. This is not a mere visionary statement, but is founded on observation and an acquaintance of several years with the resources of this range. The tailings of the rivers must be worked over ; bed-rock tunnels must be run in the ridges, for the double purpose of drainage and the extraction of the lower deposit. To give a few instances : The hydraulic ground of Dutch Flat, one of the richest localities in the State, is not all washed off, but operations have ceased for want of fall. Let a bed-rock tunnel 2,000 feet in length be run from the level of the Bear river, under the ground to the back of the town, and a new bench, 100 feet in thickness, can be run off over sluice boxes, to be placed in the bottom. The existence of the blue lead under this ground has been demon strated by the prospecting shaft of Mr. James Taef, of this place. The cement could be taken out through such a tunnel, which would necessarily drain the whole lead ; but it lies so deep here that iudividual enterprise on each claim, in raising and pumping, will not pay. Such a tunnel, by means of drifts, would work the whole lead at this place. There is au abundance of gravel here, aud the miners in some cases offer half their claims for machinery to work it. Such machinery, with water power, and including an extra $1,000 for putting the claims in better working order, would not cost more than $4,000 \u2014 a high estimate. It has been esti mated that the main tunnel above referred to would cost $25,000, but I think this too low. Near Gold Run it is contemplated to run a large tunnel, with double set of sluice boxes and tramway for cars, a distance of 5,000 feet. This will uot be needed for several years, as there is yet plenty of fall, but it is wisdom for the miners to take time by the forelock. The ground under which this will run is as rich as any in California, and the blue lead is developed both to the north and south of its proposed course. The estimated cost of this project is over $150,000, and work will be commenced this season. This tunnel will begin to pay when the first 1,000 feet is completed, and at 2,000 feet it will strike the channel ot the ancient stream, and thence run at right angles parallel with it. Millions of cubic yards of auriferous dirt and"], [43, "33 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS gravel must run through this tunnel, which debouches into a deep ravine, from which the tailings will find their way into the North Fork ofthe American. When it is considered that the usual two weeks' \"clean up \" on the smaller of these claims, using 350 inches of water, is rarely less than $3,000, can any doubt be felt of the necessity of this work? There are many other projects which could be mentioned, but being of the same nature, these will suffice. The best mining properties in California, at Smartsville, Yuba county, and San Juan, Nevada county, owe their value to extensive works of this nature. The capital necessary to prosecute these great projects must come from the east or from Europe. Here in California we are accustomed to high rates of interest aud punctual pay ments. No man puts his money out without the expectation of realizing in a few months, by a sale, or getting his interest promptly every month. The capital required here is of that class which can wait patiently for a year or two without a return ; but when that return comes it will be nearer ten per cent, per month than oue per cent, on the investment. CHAPTEE IV. GIANT POWDER AND COMMON POWDER. A ride of eight miles over somewhat steep and stony bridle-paths, from Bear Valley up Mount Oso, over its crest and along the other side, leads from the Mariposa estate to a very interesting mine, in the same county, known as the Oaks and Eeese, or Hunter's Valley mine. A Arein, bearing the local name of Blue Lead, strikes northwest through Hun ter's A^alley, parallel with the Mariposa veins. It is generally found to yield a low grade of mill-rock ; but at various points it is joined by small quartz cross-feeders ; and these are often rich, and sometimes appear to \" enrich \" the main lode. At the junction of one of these, known as Little Lead, with the Blue Lead, the Oaks and Eeese mine is situated. The average thickness of the Little Lead in this mine is fourteen inches; that of the Blue Lead, about two feet. Both are Arery hard quartz, Avith \" greenstone\" (probably altered conglomerate) walls. There is no selvage or \"gouge\" on either Avail, of which advantage can be taken in drifting or stoping, aud the faces and natural headings of the quartz incline in such a way as to increase the difficulty of back-stoping. Indeed, the stopes in this mine are all underhand. The workings comprise a shaft 233 feet deep on the junction of the A'eins, levels of 228 and 85 feet, at the depth of 150 and 200 feet respectively from this shaft, west, on the Lit tle Lead, and a level at 130 feet, southeast, on the Blue. As the veins (especially the Little Lead, which has furnished about three-fifths of the quartz sent to the mill) are so narrow, a good deal of hard country rock is blasted in stoping, and besides this it is necessary to keep driving levels and preparing new ground. It is easy to understand that these circumstances make the cost of mining very great. In fact, while the crushing and amalgamation of this quartz are effected in the beautiful ten-stamp mill belonging to the mine, at an expense of about $3 per ton, the extraction costs some $20 per ton. The average yield of the quartz in mill is said to be $30, and the quantity crushed daily is about 15jtons. The mine is owned by a company of San Francisco capitalists, and super intended by Mr. Cassell, an intelligent, enterprising and experienced miner, whose name will be remembered by Washoe or Eeese Eiver pioneers. Mr. Cassell had been using the new Giant powder exclusively, for more than a month, at the time of my visit, in June, and very cour teously placed at my disposal the results of his experience with it. To make these results useful to others, they should be accompanied with a description of the conditions under which the work is performed; and H. Ex. Doc. 54 3"], [44, "34 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES hence I have given the above details, which I consider essential to the full statement of the case. It is evident that this mine is one which would profit largely by a reduction of mining costs, since so large a proportion of its expense lies in that item. At some of the mines on the great Mother Lode, where hundreds of tons are not unfrequently throAvn down at a blast, and where a wide, soft \"gouge\" along one wall enables the miner to keep two or three sides of the rock free, and give the powder the greatest opportu nity to \"lift\" without waste of power, the cost of drilling and blasting per ton is so Ioav that a reduction of one-third, even if it could be made, would not greatly affect the general count ; but mines like the one I am describing have comparatively little timbering; and the various expenses of hoisting, transportation, &c, are overshadowed by the great item of labor, which forms, I think, in this case, more than one-third of the cost of extraction. In the second place, it is in just such hard rock, disadvantageous for common powder, and especially in running levels or sinking shafts, that instantaneous and poAverful explosives like nitroglycerine and Giant powder show their superiority. They never go out of a hole as if it were a gun-bore, or leave a large portion of it standing, so much labor Avasted. They tear to the bottom, and act in all directions Avithout waiting, as it were, to find the line of least resistance. The richness ofthe ore is another reason for using the new powder, as I shall explain hereafter. The ventilation of the mine is good, and the smoke of the powder soon disappears from the stope. This is a most important consideration, if, as some say, the smoke from nitroglycerine is injurious to the health. The experiments in which I participated did indeed give me a severe headache; but the blaster who fired the shot, and entered the stope immediately to observe its effect, said that, now he was accustomed to it, he suffered no more incoiwenience from it than from common powder. I fancy that the talk to the contrary is inspired by the prejudices of the miners, who are generally hostile to anything new, and haAre special reason to oppose this material. Before proceeding now to present the comparative statement of cost and work performed by the two systems, I will mention one interesting fact, for which Mr. Cassell ATouches. It is popularly supposed that the Giant powder can only be exploded by means of the fulminating cap. But Mr. Cassell having on one occasion charged a hole with it, and tamped lightly with clay, the charge fired itself in about 15 minutes. On another occasion a hole was charged, aud water poured in, as usual. (No tamping is required; the water softens the mass of powder iu the hole, aud the fuse, with cap attached, is theu run down into it, just before firing.) Leaving the place for a few minutes, Mr. Cassell, on his return, found the water boiling. Thinking it best to fire the hole as soon as possible, he inserted and lit the fuse, and retired precipitately. The explosion took place before the fire could have reached the cap in the ordinary way. These facts seem to show that when the poAvder is con fined, it generates a gas which causes sufficient pressure and heat to explode the whole. The powder under water, Mr. C. thinks, would not have exploded without the fuse, as gas was apparently escaping through the Avater. It is well that persons using Giant powder should take care not to leave loaded holes standing, but, in all cases, load and fire imme diately. The true way (adopted at this mine) is to employ for every shift two powder-men, whose business it is to fire the holes and clean out the stope. Meanwhile, the gang of drillers can be putting in neAv holes in another stope. Where the rock is very rich, there is a great"], [45, "35 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. incidental saving in this plan, since no one but the powder-men has any chance to pocket valuable specimens; and these men can be selected for honesty. It is much easier to fiud two trustworthy men in this respect than twenty or thirty. I saw quartz from this mine so plastered and filled with gold that a single shift of miners, doing their own blasting, on the usual system, could have carried off hundreds of dollars iu their pockets, and no one the wiser. Mr. Cassell has found it most economical to reduce the quantity of the new powder and the size of the drills, keeping the amount of rock moved per foot of drilling as it was before. Increasing the quantity of powder does not increase the effect in the same proportion. This system renders it easier to institute a comparison. I should remark that the most economical point, as to the size of charges, had not yet been reached. There was still powder wasted in the blasts, and it was anticipated that the figures given below would be still further reduced. The results were as follows: With common powder daily \u2014 Two shifts, 15 drillers, at $3\u201415 strikers, at $2 50 $82 50 Two foremen, at $125 and $100 per month 7 50 Powder, one keg, at $3 3 00 Candles 3 60 Total 96 60 Total work, 105 feet drilling, with the large l\u00a3-inch steel \u2014 cost per foot $0 92 With Giant powder daily \u2014 the same number of miners \u2014 Two shifts, 30 drillers, at $3 90 00 Two foremen, as above 7 50 Four powder-men 12 00 Powder, 10 pounds, $1 50, less 5 per cent, for cash 14 25 Candles 3 80 Total 127 55 Total work, 266 feet of small 1-inch drilling\u2014 cost per foot $0 51 Now since the small holes with Giant powder do as much execution as the larger ones with common powder, the comparative cost of using the two materials is as 51 to 92 in favor of the former. This gain arises from the fact that in boring small holes, each man works by himself, and two men drill at this mine in this way 200 inches of small holes in a day, against 84 inches of large holes on the other system, where one holds and the other strikes. It must be borne in mind, also, that in this case the drillers have no time wasted in charging or firing. All that, as well as cleaning out the slope, is done by the powder-men, while the rest are at work drilling elsewhere. The miners foresee that this change reduces the necessity for skill on their part, and will lead to the introduction of unskilled labor. With only a small drill, a foreman to set the holes and a powder-man to fire them, a Chinaman is as good as anybody, say they, and the skilled drill ers aud strikers will be superseded. This will not happen while there is so much else for Chinamen to do, and so little desire on their part to engage in underground work. Still our miners would do well to con sider that if they persist iu demanding of a struggling industry, wages which are (in many parts of the Pacific States) out of proportion to the"], [46, "36 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES cost of living, that industry will be revenged upon them by betaking itself to cheaper labor. In this connection the following account will be ot interest, as showing what can be done with common powder in blasting, when conditions are favorable. By the courtesy of Colonel George H. Mendell, of the United States engineers, San Francisco, and his assistant, Captain C. W. Eaymond, I obtained some facts on this subject, relating to operations last spring in the bay of San Francisco, which are Avorthy of preservation. Colonel Mendell is in charge of the government works at Alcatraz island and Lime Point in the harbor of San Francisco, and elsewhere on this coast. In connection more especially with the work of Lime Point, some very successful blasting has been accomplished under his direction. Lime Point and Fort Point are the two side-posts of the Golden Gate, through which the commerce of all nations passing enters the bay. It is intended to occupy these points with twin forts ; and Fort Point, as its name implies, is already fortified. At Lime Point, however, there appears, where the fortifications should be, a rocky hill, about 250 feet high, and inclined some 45 degrees. This hill it was necessary to remoA*e in order to prepare a site. The estimate of cost made before hand demanded a large sum ; but the skill and ingenuity ofthe engineers, and the favorable character of the rock, haA*e already made it evident that the necessary work can be done at comparatively light expense. About 20 feet above the water a small tuunel was driven into the hill for 60 feet, and from its interior terminus a second gallery at right angles to the first, and parallel Avith the face of the hill, was driAren for a like distance of 60 feet. Two chambers were excavated in the second gallery, one at its extremity and one about 45 feet nearer the corner. These two chambers receiATed charges of 4,000 and 3,500 pounds of blasting pow der, manufactured by the California PoAvder Company. The charges were connected Avith each other and with Beardslee's magneto-electric appara tus outside, and both tunnels were tamped with clay and sand to the mouth. The tamping was tightly rammed. The effect of such a blast of 7,500 pounds of powder, and the relattve economy of the operation as compared with ordinary methods, haA^e as much interest for mining as for military engineers. The state of affairs previous to the blast may be recapitulated thus : The aboA^e-named charge of blasting powder, in two portions, occupied a line 50 feet from the face of the hill. Above it was the Aveight of 250 feet of rock, and behind it a practically immovable mass. The rock is the well known San Francisco slate, considerably contorted, fractured, and decomposed, yet lying on the Avhole so that when the blast should have thrown out the foundation along the line of least resistance, the superincumbent mass, to an unknoAvn extent, might be expected to tumble into the sea. It should be noted that the line of effects ATe Avork (50 feet) exceeded the distance between the two charges, (45 feet,) hence the forces of explosion would meet before they could find vent through the lifted rock. The arrangement secured a maximum effect. The sagacity and accuracy of these calculations was confirmed by the thoroughly successful result. The simidtaneous explosion ofthe two charges was perfectly accomplished. There was no violent noise and no scattering of fragments \u2014 in other words no power was wasted. A little smoke and flame escaped, and the whole lower face of the hill moved silently and majestically outward, falling down into the sea, and followed by immense portions ofthe o\\*erlying rocks. For several hours the effects of the blast continued, until some 40,000 cubic yards or 80,000 tons of rock had been displaced, and a large portion of it actually"], [47, "37 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. rolled into the sea. The entrance tunnel, up to the point of turning, was left intact, Avith its tamping, so thoroughly had the force of the explosion been utilized. The tunnel being* reopeued, a short elboAv was made on the side opposite to the former gallery, and a chamber constructed fora second blast of 2,650 pounds. The tunnel being tightly tamped as before, the blast was fired with equally favorable results. The rock being con siderably disturbed, even Avhere not actually removed by the first blast, there was naturally more noise, and many small fragments Avere pro jected a considerable distance; but this incidental Avaste of power was compensated by the greater ease with which the masses of rock already losened were moved ; and the apparent effect of the second blast Avas eAren greater than that of the first. Some 20,000 cubic yards Avere added to the 40,000 already displaced. The economical aspect of the case is conclusive enough. A hundred and twenty thousand tons of rock thrown out with two blasts at a cost somewhat as follows : Por tunnels, powder, aud tamping, first blast $2,000 For reopening tunnel and second blast 500 Total 2,500 Or two and one twelfth cents per ton! The powder costs 10 cents per pound. Labor about three dollars per day. All these sums are reckoned in coin. I do not hesitate to say that no other explosive now known would do as well as this under these circumstances. Both nitroglycerine aud dynamid or \" Giant powder\" are far too rapid in their action to be employed Avhere lifting, and not shattering, is the effect desired. In tun nels and shafts, and frequently in stopes, Avhere there is great tension of surrounding rock, and little working face, these A-ioleut agents are more in place. The dynainid is rapidly disarming the feeling of appre hension so generally entertained towards all forms of nitro-glycerine, and coming into extensiAre use among the mines. The secret of its manufacture is not very profound. The engineers, in opening the tunnels to which Ave have alluded, employed dynamid which they pre pared for themselves, at first by saturating saAvdust with nitro-glycerine, and afterwards by substituting for the former material fine sand. The effect of the mixture is purely mechanical ; and this being the case it is much better to employ a substance of indifferent inorganic character, like silica, than to absorb the nitro-glycerine into organic fibres, Avhich may induce a spontaneous decomposition (not to say explo sion) analogous to that of gun-cotton. When sand is used, there is no absorption, but an enfilming ofthe particles Avith nitroglycerine, which answers the same purpose. There is a deposit near San Francisco of infusorial earth, which is sold under the fanciful name of \" electro-silicon,\" as a polishing powder. This fin e siliceous earth is admirably calculated for the manufacture of dynamid, and the article, as manufactured by the regular agents there, is appar ently (and most probably) nothing more than \" electro-silicon,\" saturated with nitroglycerine. It is true that the Giant poAvder has more the appearance of moist sawdust ; but the grains are soft and pulverulent, like those of moistened flour. In spite of the high price of a dollar and a half in gold per pound, the neAv powder is iu great demand, and its use in many cases effects a great saving. Half inch bore-holes and sin gle miners are taking* the place ofthe great two-inch drills with \"two to strike and one to hold ;\" and the high cost of dynamid (fifteen times that of powder) does not outweigh the great saving in labor aud room which it involves."], [48, "38 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES SECTION II. NOTES ON NEVADA. CHAPTEE V. PRESENT CONDITION AND PROSPECTS OF THE COMSTOCK MINES. Frequent reports and descriptions contained in pamphlets and period icals, and the voluminous evidence adduced in numerous litigations, together with the decisions of judges and juries, have given to all per sons interested in mining a general notion of the topography and geol ogy of the Washoe country, through which courses the Comstock lode ; while the forthcoming Avork of Mr. Clarence King* and his party Avill doubtless embody the results of patient and thorough scientific research into the details of the character ot the vein. I do not know to what conclusion those gentlemen have come, as to the points discussed in this report ; but Avhile I Avillingly leave to them the task of description and discussion, I feel justified in putting forward with some confidence the following opinions as to the present condition and prospects of the mines, based partly upon my own observation, andpartly upon thenotes of Mr. C\u00e6sar Luckhardt, (author of a valuable paper on the concentra tion of ores, in the preliminary report of J. Eoss Browne,) a mining engi neer, whose thorough familiarity with eArery foot of the Comstock enti tles his views to the highest consideration. To explain the sequel I shall premise a partial statement of the GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VEIN. The Comstock is situated in a heavy belt, consisting principally of metamorphic rocks, but trachyte occurs in many places in the immediate vicinity of the vein. It has a general north and south course aud an easterly dip, and has been traced ou the surface for more than 27,000 feet. Of this great length about 19,000 feet have been actually explored, and comprise the locations of the principal mines. The western bound ary or footwall of the vein consists of a syenitic* rock, which is divided from the A*ein-matter by a seam of bluish-black crystalline rock, resem bling aphanite, and locally termed \" black dyke.\" The eastern boundary, or hanging- wall, is not so well defined. For about 16,000 feet along the most developedt portion ofthe vein, it consists of a ferruginous felspathic porphyry, in A*arious stages of decomposition, up to that of plastic clay; but both north and south of this, it gradually giA*es place to diorite, and finally to a syenitic rock which can scarcely be distinguished from the foot-wall. The notion that the Comstock is a \" contact vein,\" between two distinct formations, appears, therefore, to be an erroneous oue. The width of the vein, as far as developed, may be said to average about 175 feet. Near the surface it was in places 1,100 feet ; aud in other parts, * I write this chapter purposely without reference to the masterly essay of Richthofen on the Comstock vein \u2014 not because I do not acknowledge its ability, aud, in the main, agree with its conclusions ; but because an adoption and free use of them would add little to the authority of that work, and detract from the independent value of this. t Developed, I mean, by mining work."], [49, "39 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. especially the northern portions of the vein, the walls were found to come very close together \u2014 in miners' phrase the vein is \" pinched.\" As the outcrop runs along the steep eastern slope of Mount Davidson, the vein appears, judging from the east Avail, to dip under the mountain ; and many of the early vertical shafts, sunk to pierce it in depth, were therefore located on the western side, while the true dip is to the east. The popular expression is, that the vein is \" overborne\" by the mountain and changes its dip near the surface ; but this, like almost all the min ers' terms in all countries, is the statement of the exact reverse of the truth.* The fact is that the eastern part ofthe surface, loosened by the formation of the Comstock fissure, slid or subsided, opening a wide gap, into which fragments of the couutry rock, always from the east, fell. These, acting as wedges, preATented the fissure from closing by the weight of the hanging Avail, until it Avas filled with mineral. There is nothing abstruse in this explanation ; but it must be borne in mind that neither the opening of the fissure, the movement of the country rock, nor the deposition of mineral matter Avere necessarily sudden and violent. Sir Charles LyeU has ably shown that in all probability the most stupendous geological disturbances haA*e been the result of the slowest processes. The only sudden geological operations with which we are familiar are volcanic ones ; and these are seldom connected with the immediate pro duction of mineral deposits valuable to man. The large masses of rock Avhich fell into the fissure all came, as I have said, from the east wall ; and this partly explains the irregularity of that Avail, while it also produces the appearance of a A*ariable dip, first west, then vertical, and finally east. There was much money lost by the early belief in a Avest dip, since expensiA*e buildings and machinery Avere neces sarily removed, when the truth was discoA*ered, from the west to the east side of the Arein, and much costly excaA*ation was wasted. Whether the ore and gangue of the Comstock came from the east or west, or from immeasurable depths, I shall not discuss. It seems to me that the uon metalliferous portion of the vein matter, near the surface, has been affected more or less by the decomposition and re-crystallization of the constituents of the country rock. But I shall not pause to undertake a discussion for which I do not feel sufficiently prepared. Such sugges tions as I may ATenture will be more appropriate in the sequel. One very prominent feature in the Comstock is the occurrence of alter nate metalliferous and unproductive courses or bodies of ore, imbedded in the matrix. The unproductive masses constitute by far the larger * It is a curious fact that miuers always \" put the cart before the horse,\" in describing the phenomena of their profession. For instance, if a vein, in some rich zone or pocket, is accompanied by side crevices or \" stringers,\" which also carry valuable ore, it is said that the \" stringers have enriched the vein ;\" if a \" horse,\" or mass of country rock lies in the middle of the vein, aud the ore continues around both sides reuniting beyond, the vein is said to have split and come together again ; if a vein is broken along the line of a cross fis sure, and by the slipping of the country rock, one half the vein is moved along, so that it is no longer opposite the other half, and the cross- fissure, afterwards filled with mineral, be comes itself a vein, it is said that the new vein has \" heaved\" the old one. Veins are talked of as bulging, contracting, changing their strike and dip, as though the intrusion or deposition oAheir mineral contents were itself an acting cause in determining their form ; whereas the form of a vein is generally determined by the previous fissure, and the changes which may take place after the opening of the fissure, but before it is filled with mineral. This way of speaking, however, is convenient, and does no harm, if we bear in mind that it is merely fictionary. I cannot agree with Professor Silliman, who, (ifcorrectly reported,) holding to the theory that many veins are filled by sol safari c and thermal-aqueous agen cies, nevertheless says that the fissure is frequently widened by the forces of crystalliz .tion. The manner in which thermal waters deposit their precipitates, and the phenomena observed in veins themselves, (vugs, empty spaces, and many other things,) as well as the analogies of hot springs, where veins are actually being filled, contradict this hypothesis emphatically."], [50, "40 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES portion of the whole bulk of the vein. The productive masses (ore-cham bers, chimneys, zones, bodies, bonanzas, or what not) are irregular in shape, Avith a general tendency to a lenticular form, giving a crescent in cross-section, something like a concavo-convex lens. They lie obliquely betAveen the walls, generally originating near the foot Avail, and termi nating somewhere in the vicinity of the hanging wall. They appear to be secondary in form to the local influences of the dikes or \"horses\" of unproductive ground which separate them, and render them Avider or narrower as the case may be. While most authorities noAv agree that the \"one ledge theory,\" famous in the courts, is for all practical purposes the true one, and that the Comstock ledge includes all these bodies of ore, there is still no doubt that within the limits of the original fissure these deposits are in a certain sense separate. Doubtless the same thing occurs in many fissure ATeins; it is the \\Tast proportions of this one which render it difficult to understand. Yet after all, no small fissure vein could produce the same conditions. The Axery processes which here resulted in the deposition of independent bodies of ore might, in a smaller Arein, have produced a continuous \" pay-streak,\" or central zone of ore. The Comstock was begun by nature on a vast scale ; but the vehicle (whatever it was) that brought in the ore was not so much more abundant, as the receptacle was more capacious, than in ordinary cases. To illustrate this argument, (which is equally true, AvhateA^er be the hypothesis as to the method of filling the fissure,) I will suppose that the gangue and ore were deposited from solution. This process often produces in narrow veins a banded structure. It can be observed in great perfection in many vein of Lander Hill, Eeese Eiver district, where there are alternate layers of gangue (quartz, manganese spar) and ore in the veins, parallel Avith the Avails, and symmetrically arranged ; showing, for instance, a band of quartz along either wall, then a band of spar, then in the middle of the Arein a band or pay-streak or ore. The same A^ein may, however, have in one part a single central pay streak, and in another wider part tAvo pay-streaks with quartz between. The reason is obA'ious. If the entrance of metalliferous fluids Avas abundant enough to fill with its deposit all the space not already occupied by preA'ious deposits of quartz or other gangue aloug the walls, then a single pay-streak Avas formed; but in a wider part of the same ATein, the deposit of ore merely lined the sides of the fissure, aud left room for a subsequent entrance and deposition of quartz. This gaAre the appearance of two pay-streaks, sometimes errone ously called a double vein.* Now if the ore-bearing solution Avere not eA*en abundant enough to make a continuous deposit along the walls of the fissure, and its entrances were fitful and comparatively sudden, Avhile the deposition of barren vein matter went steadily on and almost con trolled the whole space, the result might resemble the present aspect of the Comstock, and this explanation is equally applicable to the theory of solfataric action. It tends to confirm the belief that the Comstock is a true fissure ATein not different in kind, but only in degree, from other fissure- veins; that it will therefore be found to continue iu depth, and that, as the fissure in depth contracts its dimensions, the appearance of the ore deposits may change, and new conditions be developed. Perhaps a continuous deposit of low grade ore may be found instead of the present segregated masses. The 19,000 linear feet along the Arein which have been for the past *A double vein is the result of the reopening of a fissure- vein after it is once filled, and the intrusion of new vein-matter by the side or in the middle of the old."], [51, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 41 seven years explored and vigorously attacked, comprise all the locations from the Utah mine to the south part of the Overman, as follows : Feet.

The deepest point at present attained is about 1,410 feet below the outcrop of the vein. They have yielded about $80,000,000 since 1862, when Avork was systematically and vigor ously commenced. Some estimates put the total value of bullion, pro duced since the discovery, at $100,000,000. As it is my desire to discuss chiefly the possible future productiveness of the Comstock ATein, I shall mainly confine myself, in this description, to the ground which has yielded the above enormous product, and to those bodies of ore which are still being* worked. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ORE-GROUND. The Comstock A*ein (by which I mean, at present, the 19,000 feet which have been explored) may be divided into two parts \u2014 the northern part, extending from the Utah to the Chollar Potosi inclusive, and the south ern, from the Imperial North to the South Overman. Between the two is the ground occupied by the Bullion, Exchequer, Alpha, and Treglone, which is topographically a \"divide,\" the surface sloping away to the north and south on either side. This is on the boundary between Vir ginia City and Gold Hill ; and, what is still more important, it seems to be also a dividing point underground, since it is that portion of the vein whicii appears to have presented, at the period of the filling of the fissure, sufficient obstacles to prevent a uniform deposit, both north aud south * The Sierra Nevada mill has been, during the summer, successfully reducing the low grade surface ores of the northern end of the Comstock. They contain some gold."], [52, "42 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES of it, of the siliceous as well as the metalliferous matter of the vein. So far as deep workings have vet penetrated, there is a difference between the northern and southern portions. The ore bodies north of this divisimi have without exception a southerly pitch, while those immediately south of it stand almost vertically, and those still further south, without exception, pitch northward. The ores also differ, the vein matter can be in a great many instances distinguished, and even the barren portions of the A*ein, enclo sing and often penetrating the ore bodies, are not the same m character north and south of the point I have mentioned. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCTIVE GROUND I. Worth portion of tlie vein. \u2014 We have here four distinctly .separate ore bodies. First body. \u2014 This Avas found to commence near the centre of Cedar Hill, extend soutliAvard for about 200 feet, and continue 140 feet below the surface. It carries a great deal of gold, and was formerly Avorked by hydraulic means, but afterAvards abandoned. It is irregular in form, in places 35 feet AA*ide, and pinches out at the vertical depth of 140 feet. It lies in the ground of the Sierra Nevada company, Avhich is now working the ore, with results varying from $3 to $12 per ton. The company has explored the ground for 500 feet vertically beloAv the lowest point of this body, and found the vein to be filled with fragments of country rock from the east Avail, clay and clayey matter, and a little quartz in very irregular seams of small dimensions, carrying mere traces of metal. Second body. \u2014 This commenced in the Ophir North, pitched southward into the Mexican, South Ophir, Central, and a portion ofthe California companies' ground, showing a horizontal extent of about 600 feet of aA*ailable ore-ground, the whole of Avhich yielded ore abundantly ; but especially the portion in the Mexican mine, which displayed in places a breast or width of 59 feet of splendid ore. The body terminated at a vertical depth of 650 feet below the surface. It is practically exhausted, only a little ground, containing ore of Arery low grade, in the Central mine, being left. Explorations in the Ophir and Central for 200 feet below where the ore gave out failed to discover any other bodies. It is true a northern extension of this large ore-body is still standing in the North Ophir. It has been thoroughly explored in almost eATery direction, and found to extend 375 feet below the surface, and to contain thousands of tons of ore of low grade ; but this ore is mixed with a good many minerals Avhich render it, for the Washoe wet amalgamation process, very refractory, such as zincblende, galena, arsenical pyrites, &c, and man ganese ores. It is therefore at present ATalueless, and will so remain until it can be smelted with the argentiferous galena of Washoe Aralley. South of this second ore-body there is an interval of 1,384 feet, reaching to the Gould and Curry, and o*wned by Ararious companies (see catalogue above) which have explored it in an ineffective way, without finding anything, to depths varying from 150 to 400 feet. It is quite possible that the large Ophir-Mexican body may ha\\Te in this ground some out-runners or \" feeders\" (as the miners call them) or that there may be a new ore body in depth ; but, thus far, the developments made have not proved the existence of either. Third ore-body. \u2014 This is the largest and best defined yet discovered on the Comstock Arein. It commenced at the Gould and Curry claim, and extended through the Savage, Hale, and Norcross and part ofthe Chollar Potosi, a horizontal distance of 2,700 feet. It Avas found to be accom panied Avith many ore-seams and smaller bodies of ore, running parallel"], [53, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 43 Avith it and sometimes dipping into it. It began to be productive 200 feet south ofthe north line ofthe Gould and Curry, and extended 1,200 feet southward along the outcrop, when it descended below the surface, and reappeared again in the Chollar. It has been worked for its Avhole length in the Gould and Curry, to a depth of 650 feet. In the Savage it \" split\" into a north and south body, and has thus far been worked in that mine to the depth of 950 feet below the outcrop. It is proved to extend in the Savage at least 1,050 feet vertically below the croppings, and at the deepest point exposed shows a continuation still deeper. In the Hale and Norcross, the southern extension ofthe south branch in the Savage was split again into an east and west body, which descending southward, terminated in that direction, the one 146 feet and the other 310 feet south of the north line of the Chollar, in the Chollar Potosi ground. In the Gould and Curry, this body has been extracted to its lowest line. It was over 60 feet wide in some places. Only some low grade ore is now left near the outcrop ; and this the company will, in six months' time, completely exhaust. Explorations have been carried on both east and Avest of the ore-body, and for 500 feet of vertical depth beneath it, but residts have not been encouraging.* The ATein is filled with siliceous porphyries and clayey matter, and limestone in A*arious forms begins to show itself through the whole 500 feet of vertical depth above mentioned. The Savage has produced immense quantities of ore from this body. In this mine it has been exhausted to an average depth of 800 feet below the outcrop, and presented in places a breast, 96 feet wide, of very rich, solid ore. There now remains about 180 feet (A-ertical) of ground below the 800 feet above named, which has been explored and proved to contain the downward continuation of the ore-body. According to a very careful estimate, this ground will yield oA^er 56,000 tons of $35 mill-ore \u2014 that is, ore which will yield by the mill process $35 per ton. As the extraction of ore from the Savage amounted to 87,342 tons during the year ending July 1, 1868, or nearly 250 tons daily, the ground thus measured will be exhausted in less than a year from November, 1868. The latest developments iu the Savage, however, shoAv that although the northern branch of the ore-body pinched out at a A^ertical depth of 850 feet below the outcrop, (or 650 feet beloAv the mouth ofthe company's new shaft,) the southern branch still continues at a depth of 1,050 feet below the outcrop. The most encouraging fact is the discoATery of what is apparently an entirely neAv body of ore, Avhich was met with in explora- tions about 100 feet below the termination of the north branch. It sets in near the centre of the mine, has thus far shoAvn a southerly dip, and, if further developments should prove it to be extensive, Avill most import- antly affect the future of both the Savage and the Hale and Norcross. In the Hale and Norcross, the third ore-body now under discussion is represented by a southern extension from the Savage, split into an east and a west branch. The east branch has been worked to a depth of 1,000 feet below the croppings. At this depth the ore grows narrower and poorer, and divides into separate seams, some of which are more expensive to Avork than productive. These seams stand more nearly ver- tical than the body above ; and all the surroundings indicate the ap- proach of the southern terminus of the body. The lowest workings in the mine, 1,100 feet below the outcrop, show these seams still, but only close to the Savage line ; and as no new deposits of value have been yet * Since this report was written there has been a little stir about the discovery of a body of ore in depth, by the Bonner shaft. This is a mere quartz body, such as frequently occurs along the wall ; and is no proof of the neighborhood of a profitable ore-deposit."], [54, "44 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES discovered, the quantity of ore now Adsible in the mine is very small indeed. In the Chollar-Potosi, as I have said, Avas found the continuation of the west branch of the south part of the Savage body, which had passed through the entire Hale and Norcross ground. It extended about 560 feet below the outcrop, at Avhich depth it terminated. It has been worked out for about 290 feet horizontally iu the Chollar, to its terminus in depth. A small branch of ore, coming from the east branch of the southern part of the Hale and Norcross body, Avas found in the Chollar about 200 feet east ofthe continuation just described, as worked out on the Avest. It seemed as if it had been torn aAvay from the main body; commenced to show itself 342 feet below the surface; was Avorked for a length of 100 feet; descended along the east wall vertically for 150 feet ; and terminated on all sides in small, valueless seams of quartz. It is uow entirely exhausted. The company has carried on explorations for 700 feet beloAv the lowest portion of this branch, giving a total depth explored of 1,310 feet below the outcrop. These explorations showed the vein to be filled principally with clayey matter, carrying very little quartz and no ore at all. The absence of quartz at the depth attained is not encouraging. Fourth ore-body. \u2014 This Avas situated west of the southern portion of the third body, above described. It made its appearance close to the north line of the Chollar, (in what Avas formerly the Potosi and Bajazetto ground,) at the surface ; extended along and near the surface for 900 feet ; aud found its terminus at the depth of about 500 feet. It varied materially in character from No. 3. Its ores were more highly oxidized and more irregularly distributed. In places it Avas 125 feet Avide ; it was often split into three or four parallel courses ; and it has yielded immense quantities of ore. Iu 1867 it yielded for months together from 500 to 550 tons of ore daily. (The company's report for the year ending June 1, 1868, puts the whole amount of ore extracted in tAvelAre months at 70,330 tons; but this was not equally distributed through the year, as the yield from the \"Third Santa Fe\" station, in the body of ore now under discussion, ceased in February, 1868.) The Chollar-Potosi has been noted, even among the Comstock mines, for the extraordinary rapidity Avith which its ores haAre been extracted ; but it may fairly be questioned whether the policy pursued has been wise. This ore-body ought to haA'e giA*en the company three years at least of Arery profitable mining ; but the largest and by far the best part of it is already extracted, and a large portion has undoubtedly been wasted by a too speedy extrac tion. There is enough ore of low grade left to occupy the company nine months more ; but the average value has been so reduced by the extrac tion of the best portions, that the remainder Avill pay but little more than the cost of mining and milling. This concludes the description of the northern portion of productive ground on the Comstock vein. The ore-bodies described are distributed through more than 13,000 of the 19,000 linear feet under development. South of all this occurs an interval of about 2,100 feet of unproductive ground, including part of the Chollar, the whole of the Bullion, and part of the Exchequer claim. The BuUion company has expended, it is said, more than a million dollars, and explored the ground to the depth of 1,210 feet beloAv the surface Avithout finding any ore-bodies. II. South portion of the vein. \u2014 Here we meet with seven ore-bodies, much more irregular than those of the north portion, already described. First ore-body. \u2014 This appertains to the outcrop, and commenced at the Alpha mine, extending about 2,300 linear feet into the Crown Point. It"], [55, "45 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. lies west of all the bodies to be described hereafter. In no case was it found to extend deeper than 275 feet. It was in places more than 200 feet wide ; so that in the exploitation of it the whole side of the moun tain, from the Imperial to the Confidence, has been excavated. Its yield of ore has been immense, especially for the last eighteen months, previ ous to which period its ores Avere thought to be of too low a grade for profitable extraction. By far the largest portion of the bullion produced in 1867 came from this body; but it may be considered as practi cally exhausted, only here and there a patch of ore, of very low grade, now remaining. Second ore-body. \u2014 This commenced in the south portion of the Exche quer ; passed through the Alpha, Treglone, Imperial, Bacon, Empire, Eclipse, Trench, Empire South, Plato, Bowers, Piute, Consolidated, Eice, and part of the Imperial South, showing a horizontal length of about 810 feet. This body divided into many smaller ones ; but the axis of its main bulk stood almost vertical in the Arein. In the Imperial North it reached its deepest point, 750 feet beloAv the outcrop, and here it lay pretty close to the west wall, while south of this mine it nowhere extended to so great a depth. Between the Imperial North and the Empire North it attained its maximum width (iu places 115 feet) and split into A*arious smaller bodies, some of which, especially those near the surface, still continue to yield ore in the Alpha, Imperial, and some of the smaller claims ; but the quantity now remaining is limited, and will not yield great profit. The Imperial and Empire companies, conjointly, have sunk a A'ery large new shaft to explore the A*ein below the point where the ore terminated. This shaft, with its drifts, has partially explored the ground for 200 feet deeper (in all 900 feet below the surface ;) but the work has thus far not given encouraging results in the form of ore, though the quartzose gangue has beeu discovered at the depth named. Third ore-body. \u2014 This body commenced south of the Imperial South, aud extended, with a slightly eastward dip, into the Challenge, Confi dence, New York, and Washoe, and the north part of the Yellow Jacket, having thus a horizontal length of about 600 feet ; it proved to be very irregular iu form and dimensions. Its deepest point was 600 feet below the outcrop in the Confidence ; from there it rose to the southward, and in the North YelloAV Jacket it proved to extend only 475 feet below the outcrop, where it abutted abruptly against the east wall, which it fol lowed doAvnward for some distance, growing narrow aud poor, and finally pinching out. Its heaviest portion lay in the south portion ofthe North Yellow Jacket, 370 feet below the outcrop. It is now exhausted. Some ore is left near the surface all along the course ofthe body, but it is of too low a grade to be extracted at present with profit. The Yellow Jacket is the only mine on this body iu Avhich explorations have been continued below the terminus of the ore. That company has sunk 450 feet deeper, found some small detached bodies to the east, worked them out, and came finally into entirely barren ground, filling the whole fissure. At the deepest point attained in this mine the vein shows the phenome non of a dislocation of the vein matter from west to east, Avhich will be discussed further on. Fourth ore-body. \u2014 This commenced in the south portion of the Yellow Jacket, 430 feet south from the one last described. It went through the Kentuck, Crown Point, and part of the Belcher ground, showing a hori zontal length of 1,160 feet. It was much more regular than the fore going, had a general western dip, and proved to be widest in the Yellow Jacket, near the Kentuck line, in places 90 feet. In the Belcher it"], [56, "46 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES extended 300 feet vertically, in the Crown Point 400 feet, in the Kentuck 450 feet, and iu the YelloAv Jacket about 500 feet below the surface, and in all of them it Avas cut off very abruptly in or near the centre, of the vein. It may be said to be entirely exhausted of its ores. (See descrip tion of No. 6, below.) The Belcher company explored for 600 feet verti cals beloAv the south portion of this body, but so far Avithout successful results ; the vein is entirely barren at the depth attained. The explora tions of the Crown Point and YelloAv Jacket fully demonstrate the \" fault\" iu the vein matter, to be described beloAv. Fifth ore-body.\u2014 In the Segregated Belcher, (south of the Belcher mine,) and about 900 feet south of the southern terminus of ore-body No. 4, commences a piece of ground Avhich extends about 1,100 feet southward, and has contained a series of very irregularly distributed ore-bodies, which haA^e, in places, been very productive. They all had a general incline to the north, and dipped east with the vein. This 1,100 feet of ground has proved remunerative to an average depth of 450 feet below the surface. The outcrop is \" blind \" or hidden. North of the Segregated Belcher and south of the Overman this ground terminates. The princi pal portion of it is already worked out ; a good deal of loAV-grade ore still stands along its course, but the only good ore known to remain is in the Overman, where there is enough to occupy the company, at the present rate of extraction, for probably six or eight months. Some small seams aud stringers of this great mass extend below the depth at present attained by the Overman; it is quite likely that some of these may Aviden out at still greater depth ; but, as yet, they only contain loAV-grade ore, and do not exceed six feet in width. Sixth ore-body. \u2014 The large body described as No. 4 of the Yellow Jacket, Kentuck, Crown Point, and Belcher, extended to the depth of 400 to 500 feet vertically below the surface, where a body of clayey mat ter, originating from a heavy dike of felspathic porphyry, cut it off very abruptly. In the Yellow Jacket, explorations were carried on for 100 feet vertically beloAv this line, but Avithout success iu finding ore. In the CroAvn Point, explorations were made both eastward and doAvnward ; aud the A*ein matter to the east of where the ore gave out was found to be replaced, frequently for a horizontal distance (east and Avest) of 150 feet, with various species of porphyry, of Avhich felspathic porphyry pre dominated. As the prospecting Avork advanced eastward, the A*ein began to carry quartz again, aud, about 450 feet east of the place where the ore was abruptly cut off, this quartz began to carry ore. Fifty feet further east, in the 500-foot level of the Crown Point, a very fine body of ore Avas discovered. West drifts from the first body to the west Avail proved the gound to be barren. This conclusively demonstrated that the vein matter had suffered a dislocation from west to east, and the ore found east Avas locally termed the \"East Vein.\" This body has thus far been explored and Avorked for a horizontal distance of 400 feet. It has its southern terminus about 200 feet south of the north line of the CroAvn Point ; its northern limit has not yet been determined. Its upper edge is 75 feet above the 500-foot leA*el of the Crown Point ; it dips Avith the east Avail slightly to the east, and inclines so decidedly to the north in depth, that the 900-foot level of the Crown Point has not a trace of it, even at the Kentuck line. (The ore has therefore made 200 feet \" north ing\" in 400 feet vertical depth.) The terminus of this body in depth has not yet been found. The YelloAv Jacket explorations (850 feet vertically beloAv the surface) show it still continuing- downward and northward. In the Crown Point it is nearly exhausted. A careful estimate of Avhat is still standing shows about 4,000 tons of ore that will produce $30 per"], [57, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 47 ton by the Washoe wet-crushing and amalgamation. The Kentuck has also extracted a great deal from this body. At the time of my examina tion of this mine, some 450 tons of ore daily were hoisted from ground not exceeding 93 linear feet upon the vein. The amount of ore standing in the Kentuck is estimated at about 25,000 tons of $35 mill-ore. The Yellow Jacket has extracted large quantities, and still retains in view about 19,000 tons of $36 50 mill-ore. As the lower line of the ore-body has been found in CroAvn Point, the above estimate for that mine is very nearly correct ; but, in YelloAv Jacket and Kentuck, the ore extends in depth beloAv the ground included in these estimates ; and they are there fore too low. This completes the description of all the productive ground of the Corn stock vein, thus far deA*eloped;* summing it up, Ave have a total of nearly 19,000 feet explored on the vein, and an aggregate length of 5,396 feet of productiA'e ground, Ariz: Whole vein.

The foregoing description shows that very little of the productive por tion of the vein is noAv standing. Nearly all the mines contain low-grade ore, some of them eATen in large quantities ; but these ore reserves lie, for the most part, at or near the surface. The Hale and Norcross croppings, for instance, have scarcely been touched. They cannot profitably be worked at the present current expense of beneficiation. Considering- that the average width of the Comstock is 175 feet, and the greatest depth attained is only 1,210 feet below the surface, (Bullion shaft,) Avhile the work of testing the ground in horizontal directions has not kept pace adequately Avith the depths attained, we may say that explorations have not been very thorough; but the fact remains that, although there is much undeATeloped ground on the Comstock vein, the work thus far does not present very encouraging results for the imme diate future. On the north portion of the vein there are only tAvo mines, (the Savage and the Hale and Norcross,) which show at present a verti cal continuation of ore-ground. Many others, as I haAre said, haA*e con- * C.ncerning a more recent discovery iu the Yellow Jacket, the Enterprise of December 30 says: \"This strike is one of the most important ever made in the mine or upon the great Comstock lode. We say so for the reason that it is the first large deposit of extraordinary rich ore ever found at so great a depth upon the lead. Two big deposits have been found \u2014 one in the 900, and one in the 800-foot level, but the former is by far the richest and in every respect the most important. The vein iu the lower level is fully nine feet in width, aud is composed of what is called 'sacking ore' \u2014 ore so lich that it is not rudely shovelled and tumbled about, as is the case with that of a lower grade, but is put up in sacks and tenderly cared for. It is ore that will yield some thousands of dollars per ton, (we don't exactly know how many, as we have seen no assays.) and is just the next thing to finding the silver already moulded into bricks. The ore is composed of both chlorides and sulphurets, and is of a soft and crumbling nature ; at least such was the character of all the specimens shown us yesterday. In the 800-foot level, about !)0 feet north ofthe south shaft, has been found a large deposit of very rich ore, though it contains more iron and is not so much like the pure bricks as those below. Let us hope that the barren belt of the Comstock has at length been passed, and that at least one mine has entered upon the rich deposits of a second and more valuable belt than that found near the surface. This strike is certainly most encouraging to all mining companies holding ground on the Comstock, and we hope soon to hear of others striking down into the new AVhite Pine of our own big lode.\" I confess that I do not share the sanguine expectations above set forth The \"strike\" in the Yellow Jacket is, I am informed, very important; but later and more detailed accounts must be awaited before any opinion can be formed. In the mean time I see no reason for modify ing the views expressed in this chapter."], [58, "48 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES siderable reserves of low grade; but in every case the limits are known, and are near the surface. On the south portion of the vein the prospects are a little better; yet even here there are only three mines, (Kentuck, Yellow Jacket, and Overman,) which insure us at present a vertical con tinuation of ore. The low-grade reserves of other mines are considerable ; but their limits are known. It is now established that all the ore in this vein exists in zones or bodies which terminate somewhere; and it is impossible to say at what point the descending bodies in the five mines enumerated may find their loAver limits. The only hope for the future is the discovery of uew bodies of ore, (one such as has been discovered in the Savage; see description above, under ore-body No. 3 of the north portion of the vein.) Judging from present appearances only, and regardless of probable or possible new developments, I should say that remunerative operations on the Comstock proper* can only continue for a period of eighteen months or two years longer. Of course it is possible that new and brilliant dis- C0Areries may at any time completely change the face of affairs. All speculation of this kind is, hoAvever, only speculation ; and so far as we have any indications afforded, they are, I think, unfavorable to the hope of immediate discoATeries of ore. In this connection the following con siderations may be of Aralue : Since the beginning of operations on the Comstock, the ores have diminished in quality and quantity as the work advanced iu depth. No later than last year, the waste-piles of 1864 were overhauled, and immense quantities of $40 mill-ore f were obtained. In 1864 this ore was discarded as too poor; now many a mill-owner Avould be glad to buy a large dump of $15 ore. With one exception, (where the vein-matter has been dislo cated from Avest to east, in Belcher, Crown Point, Kentuck, and Yellow Jacket,) the productive ground has been the downward continuation ofthe outcrop. The bottom of this outcrop-zone has eArerywhere been reached, and an unproductive period of vein has been entered, the extent of Avhich is unknoAvn. The explorations in depth are not yet sufficient to lead to any decisive conclusions ; but some things there are which seem to indi cate that this barren ground will continue further than many suppose. For instance, it has been observed throughout the Comstock that, wher ever quartz forms the larger portion of the vein-matter, there the heavier deposits of ore haAre beeu found. Now it is found that in depth, especi ally in the northern portion of the Arein, limestone in various forms gradu ally replaces the quartz ; and no traces of metal have yet been found where the limestone predominates. Should limestone eventually form one of the principal constituents of the vein-matrix, it is quite evident that the character of the ores Avill be changed from that which they bear when accompanied with quartz ; aud this change or transition in both ore and gangue Avould be likely to occupy a considerable period of the vein, through which the mines would have to pass, Avithout meeting with much ore-ground of value. On the other hand, should further developments prove the limestone to exist only subordinately and not to interchange with the quartz, then the present barren zone might be regarded as the alternative of the productive ground aboATe ; and, from present appearances, it is Ukely to continue in proportion to the amount of the latter. In the southern portion of the Comstock, the same phenomena have not been met with ; and prospects are not quite so discouraging. Here * For a description of the metalliferous veins of the neighborhood, outside of the Comstock see below. ' t That is, ore that yielded $40 per ton in the mills, not by fire assay merely."], [59, "49 AA-EST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. we have a decided dislocation of the A'ein-matter from west to east, by a dike of porphyry ... the vein. The Avest Avail, where it has been reached, through this immense dike, Avhich lies immediately upon it, seems not to have been disturbed. The dike consists principally of porphyry of A*arious characters, imbedded in A\\*hich are smaller bunches of trachyte. It has been explored for 1,300 feet in length, and in places cut across, showing a width of 400 feet and less. Further explorations must prove whether this dike originated before or after the filling of the Comstock fissure, or contemporaneously Avith that process. It is possible that the first of these will prove to have been the truth \u2014 there are so few decisive signs of motion in the vein in this vicinity \u2014 and in that case the A'ein matter Avill gradually recede from east to Avest again ; and we may from analogy expect ores in suceess.A'e bodies until the west wall is reached. But should this dike be of more recent date than the filling of the fissure, or, still Avorse, of contempora neons origin; and should its course proATe to haA*e been upward between the AA'alls, (Avhich is possible, since it is not knoAvn to haA*e broken either Avail,) it may have filled the entire ATein for a considerable distance; and the chance of immediate discoAeries of ore Avould naturally be ATery small. The irregularities and alternations of the Comstock may naturally be expected to occur on a scale proportionate to the magnitude of the ATein, and the present barren zone, hoAveAer extensiAre, is no indication that the ore-bodies will not recur in depth. The great practical question relates to the manner in which prospecting work shall be continued. The present method of isolated shafts and exploring drifts is A*ery expen siA'e; and it is to be feared that, Avhen the ores hoav in sight shall have been extracted, the perseA*erance and capital of the companies will not be equal to the task. Besides, the ore may be expected to be more refractory in deeper zones; the large proportion of native gold and sih'er which forms the chief yield of the simple \"Washoe process\" of direct amalgamation, aud Avithout which that process could not be employed, may giA*e place to the sulphurets, Avhich are now subordinate. The cost of drainage and hoisting will increase with every hundred feet of added depth, and, in many mines, neAv and more powerful machinery will be required. Ventilation must be improved \u2014 a matter which has yet received but little attention. The newspapers lately called attention to the extremely oppressiA-e temperature in some of the deeper workings, and, ascribing it to the internal heat of the earth, expressed apprehension that it might prove a bar to future operations ; but the internal heat of the earth will not trouble the mines for many a day, if provision is made for the removal of foul air and the heat of lamps and humau bodies. All this entails grave expense, which few of the companies can bear, unless very rich deposits are soon discoA'ered. If, on the other hand, the bar ren ground to be traversed by \\*ertical workings should be as extensiA*e as those barren intervals which have already occurred on the horizontal course ofthe vein, (some of them 1,300 feet or more in length,) the out lay required for explorations would be enormous. It is important to bear in mind that, while the discoA'ery of neAv ore-bodies would postpone the eA'il day, it Avould not relieve the mines from the constant expense and burden of the present system of Avorking. The true economy is to open the A'ein by a deep tunnel and drifts, reduce the number of shafts, and consolidate the management of the mines in many respects. (Own erships of course may remain as they are, but administration should be modified by association.) H. Ex. Doc. 54 4"], [60, "50 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTIVE MINING GROUND SITUATED OUTSIDE OF THE COMSTOCK VEIN. Both east and west of the Comstock many locations have been made, and considerable prospecting has been done. On the Avest occurs a series of small quartz veins, imbedded in the syenite, and carrying pre cious metals, principally gold. They run, as a general rule, parallel with the Comstock, but are narrow ; and none of them has yet given en couragement for the outlay of time and capital. In the low hills of meta morphic rocks, west of Washoe valley, is a well-defined A*ein, carrying argentiferous galena, which will undoubtedly, at some future day, become very valuable. Several attempts have been made to Avork its ores ; but want of confidence has prevented adequate investment of capital ; and the ill success of the initial operations in treating the ores tended to destroy all faith in the enterprise. It is for the present abandoned. East ofthe Comstock, and 1% ortA\\ro miles distant, isa \"contact- A-ein,\" which has been traced for three miles northeast and south Avest, and found to A-ary in width betAveen 10 and 50 feet. The matrix in the north por tion is quartz. Near the surface in the south portion occur heavy layers of lime rock, which yield in depth to quartz. The vein dips east, the foot- Avall is diorite, and the hanging-wall trachyte and trachitic rocks, separated from the vein by a heavy band of argillaceous matter. A large number of locations, Avith an aggregate length of about three miles, have been made upon the A*ein. Many of the companies formerly at work sank shafts and ran prospecting drifts and tunnels, but, finding the ores unremuner atiA'e, abandoned operations. Since the cost of milling has been reduced, (it is uoav $12 per ton, I belieA*e, at the custom mills,) several companies IniA'e resumed Avork. The principal ones are the Lady Bryan, St. George, Occidental, and Metropolitan. The largest developments haA*e been made by the Occidental Company, which has opened the A'ein to the depth of 600 feet, and is now running a tunnel to cut it at 850 feet. In this mine an enormous body of loAV-grade ore has been exposed, yielding $17 to $28 per ton, and a large amount of it has been already extracted ; but the greater bulk is still standing in the mine, and promises, so far as it is developed, at least tAvo years of profitable mining to the company. The vein has thus far continued productive in depth, and it will not be long before the entire length of the locations will be under actiAre deA'el opment. One great advantage of this Arein is its accessibility in many places by means of cross-tunnels from the slope of the hills, rendering expensive hoisting Avorks unnecessary. Another advantage is the sta bility ofthe enclosing rocks, enabling the miners in excaA'ating ore to dispense with the costly item of timbering, Avhich is absolutely required in the Comstock. An estimate shows that for a length of more than 1 ,000 feet on this vein the ores can be extracted to the depth of 800 feet beloAv the outcrop, at an average cost of $1 75 per ton. In other parts of the vein the conditions are not quite so favorable. In many places this cheap extraction could only be carried 300 feet beloAv the outcrop. The productiveness of this vein is a A'ery fortunate circumstance for the numerous mills which have heretofore reduced the Comstock ores, and are now likely to find employment here.for a long time to come. THE SUTRO TUNNEL. It is sufficiently evident from the foregoing description that the future of the Comstock mines depends on the discovery aud successful explora tion of new bodies of ore, and the reduction of expenses so far as to per mit the extraction and beneficiation ofthe low-grade ores which are"], [61, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 51 expected by good judges to predominate in depth. (See report of Baron A'on Eichthofen.) For both of these results some change in the present system of mining is vitally important. Sir. Sutro's plan for a deep adit, starting near the Carson riA*er, and cutting the vein 1,970 feet below the outcrop, presents one solution of the problem. The plan for the construction of the Sutro tunnel has been before the country for several years and is sufficiently well known. A full account of it is contained iu the two reports of Mr. J. Eoss BroAvue, and I can only say here that the developments of the past year, and the present condition and prospects of the Comstock mines, discussed above, tend to establish more positively than eA'er the absolute necessity of this great Avork. The barren ground hoav presenting itself should be underrun with a tunnel, and the necessary dead-Avork cheapened. A few remarks will show what interest the government possesses in the question: 1. The bullion product of the United States is decreasing eA-ery year. There are various reasons for this decrease. Some of them are beyond the reach of legislation, while others are themselves the results of unwise legislation. Everybody admits the decrease to be, especially at this time, a national misfortune. 2. One great cause of trouble is the fact that mining has not on the whole been profitable to individual adventurers. And of this fact the Comstock lode has furnished a striking example. Nearly $100,000,000 have been extracted from that one lode within the past nine years, yet the aggregate cost to owners has been almost as much. The reason is simple. Unnecessary labor has been employed, and A'ast sums of money wasted in extravagant speculations and litigations ; and the root of the Avhole eA'il lies iu the system of scattered, jealous, individual activity, which has destroyed, by dividing, the resources of the most magnificent oredeposit in the world. Thirty-five or forty companies, each owning from 10 to 1,400 feet along the vein, and each (almost without exception) working its oavu ground independently ; 40 superintendents, 40 presi dents, 4(J secretaries, 40 boards of directors, all to be supplied Avith salaries, or, worse yet, with perquisites, or, worst of all, with opportunities to speculate; an army of lawyers and witnesses, peripatetic experts, competing assayers, thousands of miners, uniting to keep up the rate of wages ; these things explain the heavy expense of Comstock mining. Aside from this immense drain of money, amounting to 20 per cent, of the AA'hole production, the labor actually performed has been, for want of united action, often useless. There have been tunnels enough run by different companies into the Comstock lode to make, if put together, the Avhole length of the Sutro tunnel. Hardly one of them is good for any thing to-day. The Bullion company, which has the deepest shaft on the lode, never had any ore, but has spent more than a million of dollars in prospecting, while some neighboring mines, like the little Kentuck, have been in bonanza for long periods. Noav this division of a A-ein, which gives the rich chimney to one oAvner and the barren intervals to another. is not conducive to economy. The result has proved to be that both owners waste money. All the explorations in the barren mines of the Comstock could have been executed with the money flung away by the mines that have had, for a time, rich ore. 3. Those errors in legislation, or the want of it, which have permitted the growth of such a condition of things, canuot noAv be repaired. It is not wise to interfere Avith existing privileges, even though they have no other foundation in right than a custom of 10 years' standing. The com panies on the Comstock lode must be allowed to go on until the stern fact of failure forces them to adopt some system of association."], [62, "52 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES 4. At present, however, the tendency is more than ever the other way. As the prospects of mining on the old wasteful plan grow darker and daiker, officers, agents, and stockholders bend their energies to save what thev can by speculation out of the approaching wreck. We might well afford to leave them to their fate, but for the fact that the effect of an abandonment of the Comstock lode would be almost fatal to syste matic and permanent mining in the Pacific States. It would confirm the mischievous feeling that mining is half grab and half gamble; that the only way to make money at it is to dig out what rich ore you can get, and then find a fool to buy the property; or failing that, to make a fool of that collective individual, the public, and to \" unload\" yourself of your stock. 5. The Sutro tunnel will do four most important things : it will settle the question of the continuance of the Comstock in depth ; it will inevi tably unite the mining companies in many respects, and remove much of the expense of separate pumping, hoisting, prospecting, and general administration;* it will render possible the beueficiation of low-grade ores, absolutely the only basis for rational and permanent mining ; and, finally, by assuring the future, it will kill that speculation which thrives on ignorance of the future. 6. I do not think the tunnel would prove a total pecuniary loss in the worst event, since it would also explore in depth a country which is very likely to contain other bodies of rich ore. All the indications are that the origin ofthe Comstock bodies ivas east of the vein, aud jjromising deposits are already known to exist in that direction. VIRGINIA AND CARSON CITY RAILROAD. A movement is on foot, looking to the passage of a bill by the present legislature of Nevada in aid of the construction of a railway from Vir ginia City to the Sierras by way of Carson City. This project is urged by the Milling Association, which owns most of the mills about Virginia. They also expect aid from Comstock and Story counties. Its .success will enable them to bring wood in abundance and at low rates to the mills. These will then be arranged to work large quantities of low-grade ores, and the mines will be gutted to supply them. This plan will be beneficial, whether the Sutro tunnel should be run or not. It will pri marily facilitate the reduction of the bodies of low-grade ores now ex posed in the Comstock vein \u2014 all of which are near the surface, and can be more cheaply extracted by shafts thsin by a deep tunnel. It will also establish a permfiuent communication between the district and the for ests of the Sierra, on which all dependence for fuel must be placed ; and it will materially cheapen the cost of all materials and supplies, and place Virginia City en rapport with the great Pacific railroad. Finally, it will run by the Spring Valley mines, which will probably be again * The direct saving in drainage is doubled by the fact that the water now lifted at great expense, by steam, would, if allowed to fall instead, itself generate a motive power, to take the place of steam. Hydraulic engines utilizing this source of power are common in the deep mines of Europe, hut have never been introduced in this country. In the case under discussion, the conditions would be extremely favorable, permitting a hydraulic column of 2,00. feet. Fifty gallons of water per secoud. with a fall of 2,000 feet create a working capacity of 1,800 horse-power. Another way of utilizing the water of drainage would be the erection of water-wheels uuder ground, by which various operations requiring machinery could be conducted. This, too, is very common in Europe, and, like the use of hydraulic engines, may be introduced with advantage wherever there is deep tunnel-drainao-e In the a!;-, nee of deep drainage, both these economical devices of science are out of the question If the Sutro tunnel is completed to the lode, and connected with deep shafts the conditions fur further cxp'orations to still greater depths will be more favorable than they were al the verti surface ; sii.ee the immense power ofthe hydraulic column will be at the service ofthe miner"], [63, "53 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. opened, and will be likely to furnish a large quantity of rock worth $20 to $25 per ton. It is evident, however, that nothing but a deep tunnel can secure the future of mining on the Comstock lode. All other plans are merely ex pedients to save as much as possible from the approaching wreck ; and even the discoveries of new bodies of ore by the present deep shafts will but prolong for a time a system of working which has proved in the main, unprofitable. TAILINGS AND SLIMES AT VIRGINIA CITY. The tailings are those portions of fine sand and gold, silver and quick silver which escape from the settlers, suspended in water, and are either allowed to run off entirely, or caught in reservoirs, or concentrated upon sluices. Tbe slimes are finely divided sulphurets, which are even longer in settling than the tailings, and have hitherto not been successfully caught and worked. There are thousands of tons of tailings and slimes in the cauons where the Comstock mills are situated ; and their econom ical treatment is a matter of great importance. I am indebted to Louis Janin, esq., late superintendent of the Gould & Curry, for considerable information on this subject, which will be more appropriately given in a future report on methods and apparatus of American mining. In this place a few remarks will suffice. The tailings vary in value according to the quality of ores worked in the mills, the economy and thoroughness of the mill treatment, the ad mixture of slimes in the reservoirs, &c. Twelve assays at different points in the Carson river reservoir gave results varying from $7 68 to $24 31 per ton, the average being $12 79. The richest results were nearest the embankment, where the slimes had settled. The slime pit below the reservoir gave assays of $19 22 per ton. From one-third to one-half the value of bullion is gold. A good deal of amalgam and quicksilver is obtained from tailings in actual re-working; but this is not a constant quantity, and is not included in the results of the above assays, which were made upon samples washed free from quicksilver beforehand. The Gould & Curry reservoir mill worked from July to November, 1867, S61 tous of tailings in Varney and Wakelee pans, with the following results: These were evidently concentrated tailings. From the Park reservoir 764 tons of tailings, worked in the fountain pan, yielded 60 pounds 11 ounces of amalgam, worth about $3 98 per pound or $241 54, making the average yield per tou $3 16. It is not necessary to point out to the educated engineer that the foregoing data as to the value of tailings and slimes are inconsistent with the popular notion that only HAj per cent, of the silver iu the Comstock ore is extracted by the Washoe process. A loss of 35 per cent, should leave richer tailings. In poiut of fact, Lot No. 1. Lot No. 2.

Dr. j. P. Kimball, of the American Bureau of Mines, speaks* of a loss of $9,000,000 from this source in 1807, and Mr. J. Ross Browne falls into the same error. (Report of 1868, page 364.) The truth is that the assays are made with dry powered samples, aud the ore is sent to the mills with more or less moisture, varying, it is said, from three to 10 per cent. Sixty-five per cent, of the assay value _per dry ton, applied to the moist ton means therefore, in reality, from 67 to 72 per cent., which is what the mine receives. But besides this, the amalgam caught by simple concentration from the tailings is a perquisite of the mill. In fact, the low rates of custom mills are made possible by the margin of profit left between the 67 to 72 per cent, which the mills guarantee, .and the 75 to 80 per cent, which they actually extract. The Washoe process is not a rude aud imperfect one in principle ; it is scien tific and remarkably successful \u2014 better for the circumstances than any European process. A little more economy and care in managing the details, and above all such a study of the process itself by the mill-men as would settle its real nature and priuciples, aud lead to some uniform rules as to the management of certain parts of it, would make it a credit to American ingenuity and skill. A great improvement has been made since Mr. Guido Kiistel t described the W7ashoe process, in the introduc tion of large pans; and the necessity for increased economy is now lead ing to still other improvements. In this respect the Comstock mining enterprises have nothing to be ashamed of. The comj-arison often made with the Reese River mills, which charge high prices and guarantee 80 per cent., is thus seen to be based on an apparent, rather than a real difference. No doubt the loss by the Washoe process will be much larger if the proportion of native gold and silver in the ore decreases in depth. The amount of tailings and slimes collected in various reservoirs, since the practice of saving them was introduced, amounts to many thousand tons. Janin's Dayton mill, which works tailings only, has (or will soon have) a capacity of fifty tons daily, and supplies assured of some 75,000 tons. The large Dayton reservoir contains some 140,000 tons, and the Carson River reservoir (which being furthest from the mills contains most slimes) about 200,000 more. There are numerous others, but the occasional floods in the narrow canons have carried away a large amount of tailings to the Carson. *Memoirs of the American Bureau of Mines, I8B7. tNevada and California processes, &c, San Francisco, 1_63."], [65, "55 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.

Amount of ore extracted from the mine, 70,330| tons, of which 29,792 tons came from the third Santa Fe station, and 15,671 from the Blue Wing. The total quantity of ore milled was 77,957J tons, and the following figures will illustrate the cost of production : Average yield per ton $24 14 Cost of milling per ton $14 75 Actual cost of extracting per ton 4 24 Filling mine and dead work per ton extracted 33J Taxes per tou 22\u00a3 Expenses at new works per ton 1 87 Incidentals per ton 26 21 68 Net yield per ton 2 46 The amount expended for account of new shaft was $131,835 86. In the old mine, as nearly as can be calculated, there are 33,000 tons of ore that will afford a small margin over expense of mining aud milling. The new shaft penetrated the west wall at a depth of 913 feet from the surface. Here a station has been made, and an incline at an angle of 45\u00b0 has been driven to the extent of 266 feet. Two stations have been made in the incline\u2014 one at 1,000 and the other at 1,100 feet, leaving 247 feetof unprospected ground overhead. They are about to drift east from the 1, 100 level, and the incline will be continued down to another statiou. These deep driftings are of great importance, as upon their favorable development depends the success of the company in the future. RECEIPTS.

OR3ISBY, WASHOE AND CHURCHILL COUNTIES. The following letters, addressed to Surveyor General A. P. E. Safford, of Virginia City, who kindly made inquiries for me, will show the con dition of mining for the year in the counties above mentioned : Office of the County Assessor, Ormsby County, Nevada, Carson City, August 24, 1868. Dear Sir: Your communication of the 24th instant is before me, and contents noted. In reply I have to say that at present there are no producing mines iu Ormsby county. All the ores worked in this county are from mines situated in Storey county, of which there is no such statistical information as you desire in this office. During the years 1865 and 1866 some work was done upon the Athens mine, owned by the Athens Company, and situated in the foot-hills about three miles west of Carson City. Some 20 or 30 tous of ore were extracted from the mine and reduced at the Carson mill sitfiated near by. Of the amount of the precious metals produced therefrom I am not informed, but believe it was not sufficient to warrant the further prosecution of work upon the mine, as since that date no work has been done. I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, GEORGE W. CHEDIC, County Assessor. By H. H. BENCE, Deputy. Washoe, September lsi, 1868. Dear Sir: Yours of August 21 came during my absence, and was mislaid and not dis covered until yesterday. In reply I will state that there are no paying mines in this county. A great many experiments have been made with some galena found near the town of Washoe City, but with poor success, aud no work is being done at present. In what is known as the Peavine district there is copper ore, but it has never been worked successfully, and is pretty much abandoned. No returns have been made from any mines in this county. Yours, respectfully, T. A. READ, Assessor of Washoe County, Nevada. St. Clair's Station, Churchill County, Nevada, September 14, 1868. Dear Sir: Your note of inquiry came to hand. I will say. in answer, that there are no mines working iu this county this year. The report of 1866 will give you all the informa tion that I can in regard to mines and mills in this county, except one small five-stamp mill near New Pass, in the east end of the county. The company is prospecting its ledges with favorable results. There are no quarterly reports to be made this year. The mills are all lying idle. Yours, with respect, C. ALLEN, County Assessor. The New Pass mill, to which allusion is made in the foregoino- letter was formerly the Ware mill of Austin, and has been purchased and removed by Mr. Slauson and others, to work the ores of the New Pass district. This district, situated about 22 miles west of Austin, but on the other side of the county line, and in Churchill county, is remarka ble for containing gold instead of silver ores, and for certain beds of iossililerous limestone which I believe to be of Jurassic age. The Sho shone range, forming the western boundary of Eeese Eiver valley divides south ot New Pass into two chains, which unite again north of the district The eastern chain is called Mt. Airy, and the western New Pass The district is not large, but very diversified in surface, and remarkably abundant in springs, timber, fine grass, and arable land.

I visited the district last summer, and was much impressed with its advantages. I have not since heard of the results of the treatment of the ores in the mill. All or nearly all the veins above named belong to the same company. CHAPTEE VI. LANDER COUNTY. Reese River district.\u2014 This district has been frequently and fully de scribed, and I propose to offer, not a detailed account of the different mines, but a few general remarks concerning the results of seven years' experience. Having been familiar with the history of the district, I can speak with greater confidence. The rich veins of Lander Hill have always been known to be very narrow, rarely more than two feet in width, and only in brilliant instances carrying a \" pay-streak\" of more than six inches. At the same time they are unmistakably fissure-veins \u2014 perhaps the most distinct specimens of that class in all the west. They show very clearly the manner in which their fissures were filled, by successive depositions of quartz, manganese .spar, silver ore, &c, along their walls. Tlie seams in the granite of Lan der Hill are very numerous and very close together ; and on the surface one looks as promising as another. Almost all of the thousands of out crops which have been located here carried rich chloride ore in pockets or streaks. It was inevitable, therefore, that in the beginning both the miners and experts sent to examine the veins should consider them as generally of equal value. Some praised them all alike; others con demned them all alike. The first step of progress was the distinction made between the veins in granite and those in slate, and between the northwest and southeast veins and the north and south ones. Tlie veins running northwest and southeast were pronounced by experts the most valuable system. The developments of actual working have siuce determined sever.il highly important facts, among which are the follow ing: , , _ _ , \u201e 1. It is found that the mines on the western half of Lander Hill contain in depth large quantities of base metals, whicii render the profitable reduction of their ores at present rates impossible. This is the case with mines which, on the surface, produced chloride of silver of great purity and richness. The Diana is an example. 2. It is found that many of the outcrops on Lander Hill do not con tinue as independent veins\" in depth. At least, in one or two instances, deep cross-cuts, iinderriinning the outcrops, have not exposed the veins. I believe this is owing either to the fact that these surface veins are merely spurs of persistent fissures, with which, at no great depth, they unite themselves, or to the closing of the small futures by the weight of the hanging wall, and the partial or total obliteration of the seam by infiltration and slight decomposition of the granite. The latter seems to me most probable. The flat dip of most of the veins makes a"], [88, "78 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES permanent unsupported open fissure impossible ; and all the signs show that the fissures of Lander Hill, subsequent to their formation, and pre vious to their filling, closed up wherever it was possible, and only remained open where fragments or projecting points of the wall-rock prevented them from closing. 3. It is found that all the veins of the eastern and richer part ot Lan der Hill have been obliquely cut off in depth by cross-seams, and that the whole country rock, above these seams, has slid southward carrying with it the upper portions of the veins. It seems likely that there are one or two great slides common to all the mines of this group ; but this point is not fully established. It is certain, however, that the veins are cut off at various depths, and must be sought again by northeastward cross-cuts, below the faults. 4. It is believed that the distance to whicii the upper portion ot a vein has been heaved is often greater than the distance on the surface between the outcrops of two veins ; consequently, when the miner drives his cross-tunnel to find again the downward continuation of his vein, he may strike first the vein of a neighbor; and it is extremely difficult, in view of the great similarity mineralogically, and the great variability in size, of the Lander Hill veins, to decide which is the continuation in depth of a given vein, cut off by a cross-seam. This difficulty can' be illustrated to every mind by a simple experiment. Take a card and draw across it several parallel oblique lines, not of uniform thickness, but bulging and narrowing, as when the pressure upon the pen is made alter nately heavy and light. Let the lines be, say, half an inch apart. They will then answer to represent cross-sections of different parallel A*eins. Now cut the card in two, along an oblique line nearer to the horizontal than that ofthe veins, and slide the upper half of the card down hill , as it were, for one inch. The newposition of thelines will represent a section ofthe veins after the slide ; and the difficulty of deciding (without knowing exactly how far the upper portion has moved) \" which is which,\" is sufficiently evident. This is the precise nature of the difficulty on Lander Hill. There is scarcely a producing mine on the hill which is not working a vein claimed by some one else ; and the question of title is generally settled by the financial position of the parties. Eich and prosperous companies hold their ground. In cases where both parties have capital, the strug gle is likely to be prolonged unless they wisely compromise at the outset. The root of the trouble is the absurd and unreasonable nearness to one another of the Lander Hill locations. The United States law can scarcely be applied, and if it could, would not help the matter. There is no help for it, except the gradual acquirement, by a few strong com panies, of the whole of the hill. These companies should then unite to construct a tunnel from Clifton to Mount Prometheus, cutting their veins at a depth of 1,000 or more feet. The tunnel scheme is now in the hands of energetic men, who, if they carry it through, will claim all the veins they cut, and thus a new element of chaos will be added. The foregoing remarks as to the nearness of locations and the slides in the veins, are partially illustrated by the rough sketch here given of the portion of Lander Hill now producing ore. But a very smallportion of the locations is shown on the sketch. They are frequently only 50 feet apart. The distance between the two shafts of the Manhattan (about 500 feet) shows how far the North Star and Oregon ledges of that company have been thrown by the slide. The North Star is cut by the lower shaft at the depth of 310 feet, and it is supposed to cross the upper at not more than 4(50 feet. If the vein were restored to its original posi tion, the two shafts cutting it would probably be less than 200 feet apart."], [89, "Topographical sketch showing the locations of the principal mines of that portion of Lander Hill now producing ore"], [90, ""], [91, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 79 5. It is found that the veins of Lander Hill frequently \" pinch,\" and contain large barren intervals, sometimes only showing a clay seam where the A'ein should be. This is a disastrous peculiarity for mining on the present system of small ownerships. The profits of the bonanza are wasted in the administration of the mine, and there is nothing saved for the period of dead work in exploration. None of the mines have exten sive reserves. But on the other baud, these narrow but persistent veins may be followed in the firm faith that they will widen again and contain ore. What is needed is a proper system for prospecting work, reducing it to its lowest cost. G. There is a great deal of low-grade ore not sent to mill. Small as the veins are, their product is still further reduced by wasteful sorting. The rich ore only is sent to mill, and has, therefore, to bear the cost of the whole extraction. Of course the second class ore is made all the poorer by such handling, (the average ofthe whole being reduced,) and is less likely than ever to be profitably reduced. Concentration of the dry pulp, so as to give a rich product for roasting and amalgamation, if it could be successfully carried out, would work a great and beneficial change in the management of the mines. A great many persons (see Mr. Browne's last report, page 401, note) seem to think the cost of the ordinary concentration is what prevents its use in Eeese river, and not to be aware that it is the actual loss of silver ore in the operation which renders the use of concentration by water impossible. This loss some times amounts to 80 per cent. At the Comstock mines there are exten sive sluices and other apparatus for catching and concentrating tailings, but the lightest portion of all, which floats further than the tailings themselves, is the sulphurets of silver. The desideratum is a dry con centrator. The particles of sulphurets are specifically heavier than quartz ; it is their shape and fineness which make them float in water. But the thinner medium, air, if properly employed, might give better results. I have never heard of dry concentrators being tested in Neva da, but I presume they will be tried before long. 7. The necessity of roasting the ores with salt before amalgamation is a serious addition to the cost of treatment. Mining and milling cost subtracted, there is uo margin of profit, in most cases, on ore which assays less than $75. This is the real secret of the high milling results from Eeese Eiver ores, so often boastingly compared with those of Washoe. Mining is never on a sound aud prosperous footing until low-grade ores are successfully reduced. Even on the Comstock vein, as I have shown, this is not the case to such an extent as might be wished; but in eastern Nevada the waste of low-grade ores is still greater. In a certain sense the high yield per ton reported from these districts is a measure of the wastefulness of mining. It represents, not the average quality of the vein matter but the quality of that portion of it tchich is rich enough to pay for m illinq These remarks do not at present apply to White Pine ; but there is little doubt that, sooner or later, the profits of mining, even there, will depend upon the cost of reduction and the treatment of low-grade ores. I have already spoken of concentration as a possible cure for this evil; and it remains to be added that any reduction of mining or milling cost will sensiblv increase the amount of ore reduced in Eeese Eiver and simi lar districts. The gradual fall in wages and living expenses will do some thin\"'; and among inventions for the saving of expense the new chlond izing furnace of Mr. Stetefeldt promises to be highly beneficial. It saves a great deal of the cost of roasting, and, what is even more import ant a part of the saving is in fuel\u2014 the scarcity of which m Nevada, and the 'disastrous consequences of its exhaustion, are not to be measured by its present money value."], [92, "80 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES 8. I do not see any reason to believe that the resources of Eeese Eiver district are exhausted. On the contrary, they have but just been skimmed. Not a single mine is deep enough to be upon the undisturl >ei I and settled portion of its vein. At the same time, it is evident that a consolidation of properties and a new and more economical system ot mining will be required for the adequate future development of the dis trict. The principal producing mines at the present time are the Manhattan North Star, the Buel North Star, the South AmericanLand one or two others. The old Yankee Blade, in Yankee Blade canon, three miles north of Austin, has been reopened with success; and the Chase mine, one mile further north, supposed to be the same as the Tuolumue vein in Yankee Blade canon, is producing rich ore in small quantities, aud is being gradually developed for systematic working. The valleys of Nevada.\u2014 Like a great many other so-called deserts, the great American desert is not so bad as it is painted. There are spots in it whicii seem to be forsaken alike of nature and of man; but a greater part of the sage-brush country \u2014 even the alkali country \u2014 is inhabitable, and capable of sustaining a rural population. Nevada, in an agricultural point of view, perhaps at present the most forbidding of all the States, will ere long supply her own people with the necessaries of life. The lauds of Nevada may be divided into three classes \u2014 those which are absolutely worthless, (say one- third ofthe whole area;) those whicii could be made productive by irrigation ; and those which may be occu pied as ranches without irrigation. The latter class is far more abundant than a casual observer might suppo.se. The history of eastern Nevada furnishes a curious illustration of this fact. For the first year or two after the country was opened by the pioneers it was thought impossible to keep stock in these mountains and valleys through the winter. Now liorses and cattle of all kinds are turned out for the winter, and actually fatten on the white sage and the \"bunch grass.\" The latter is a product remarkably adapted to this climate. It starts very early \u2014 as soon as the snow disappears from the valleys \u2014 comes speedily to maturity, and, when the rains cease, wisely dries up and turns into a nutritious, stand ing hay. Its most useful peculiarity is the tenacity with which it clings to its seeds, which (in the variety known as sand-grass) are small, dark grains, which the Indians thresh out and convert into bread, and which cattle devour with avidity, even digging in the snow, sometimes, to obtain them. This grass grows in bunches, almost as if planted in hills ; and the traveller may frequently discern at a great distance patches of these bunches, sometimes several square miles in extent, contesting with the sage-brush the occupation of the arid soil, and forming, with their light straw-color, a striking contrast to the dusty green and gray of the latter. I should think this grass might be cultivated with success on many sandy soils of the east, and would convert useless waste lands into valuable pastures. Ou the other hand, it is likely that winter wheat and barley would do pretty well on some of the land here, even without arti ficial irrigation, since they would escape the destructive effects of the dryest season. At present there are many ranches in the valleys of Nevada where stock-raising, haying, a little cultivation of grains, and a little dairy-work are carried on with success. The topography of eastern Nevada is formed by a succession of valleys, separated by meridional ranges of mountains. An travelling eastward from Virginia City, by the overland road, the stage, for days together alternately climbs over these ranges, or traverses, often enveloped in clouds of irritating and suffocating alkaline dust, the level lands between."], [93, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN!.. 81 A remarkable peculiarity of these valleys is that they are not con- nected with one another. Each has its own water-system and its own level. Smoky valley lies much lower than Eeese Eiver valley, yet there is no water flowing from one into the other. They are rather'like ter- races than ordinary river valleys. Frequently they do not contain anv main streams at all; when they do, it is merely the snow-water from the mountains which unites in the centre of the lower lands. All the rivers, creeks, brooks, and .springs finally stop short, and \"sink\"\u2014 that is, spread into pools, and disappear, partly by absorption into the porous soil, and partly by the rapid co-operation induced by this dry and ever-shifting air. That evaporation has a great deal to do with this phenomenon may easily be proved. In Smoky valley, for instance, whicii has no river, almost all the tributaries from the mountains \"sink\" before they can find their way to the middle of the vast plain. One or two attain the barren honor of reaching the goal, and ignominiously disappearing in a puddle there. But riding along the road in the early morning, one will find many a musical brook of clear, cold water, rippling across the way, and, with vain ambi- tion, attempting the passage through the desert, through which one can trace its path for miles by the livelier green of the brush, or perhaps by a scanty fringe of willows along* its banks. Eeturn in the afternoon, and the same channel will be as dry as though it had forgotten the taste of water; yet the snows above are melting abundantly, and the soil cannot absorb more at one time than another. It is the evaporation which makes the difference. The ground is covered in many places with efflor- escence of alkaline salts, formerly in solution in the springs. These alkaline deposits have not been utilized, except in Humboldt county, where they furnish soda and lime fluxes for smelting. The salt-marshes, however, which are formed by the evaporation of saline springs, are eagerly occupied, and the salt is collected and sold to the quartz mills, where it is used in chloridizing the sulphuretted silver ores to prepare them for amalgamation. The manner of obtaining the salt is very simple. It is shaved from the smoothed surface of the ground, and packed in sacks for transportation. In a short time there is a new coating of salt on the same ground. Experience has shown that more is obtained by frequent gathering in this manner than by waiting for a greater depth of salt to accumulate. The product is, of course, not pure. It contains many alkaline salts ; and, from the color which I observed in some of the flames of the reverberatories, I believe that considerable chloride of potassium is mixed with the chloride of sodium. In purchasing salt, however, the mill-men only care to know what proportion of chlorine it contains, and on this basis the price is regulated. Some of the marsh-owners, I believe, have attempted to refine their salt by boiling or by re-solution and evaporation \u2014 but I doubt whether the manufacture coidd be made profitable. The impurities in the salt are not known to be greatly inju- rious in the furnaces; and the mills woidd hardly be willing to pay more in proportion for their chlorides for the sake of getting them pure. Cortez district lies about 60 miles northeast of Austin. In topographical and geological features, it strongly resembles Eeveille district. The prin- cipal mountain chain runsnorth and south. It is the range eastof the Toi- vabe and comprises the high peak of Tenabo. The western declivity is a steep cliff of granular dolomite. Near the summit is an intercalation of quartzite more than 300 feet thick, and stretching along the range for miles. This quartzite belt was considered to be a vein by the first dis coverers, and christened the Nevada Giant. It carries no ore, but both above and below it are found masses of ore similar to those of Eeveille district, but on the whole not so rich in silver, and more debased with H. Ex. Doc. 54 fi"], [94, "82 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES zinc, blende, galena, iron and copper pyrites. Neither are the ore masses in Cortez district so numerous. They seem to be more confined to cer tain zones of the dolomite. (This has hitherto been the case also in White Pine.) These bodies of ore, like those of Eeveille, and, I thmlj, of White Pine also, probably owe their origin to the formation ot cavi ties in the dolomite, and the subsequent filling of these cavities with ore by means of mineral springs. The formation of the cavities, a frequent phenomenon in dolomite and limestone, might take place in several ways, as, for instance, through the action of carbonic acid waters, which carried away the lime as bicarbonate in solution ; or by the contraction of the dolomite itself, in changing from its sedimentary to its crystal line form ; or finally, by the penetration of the same solfataric (sulphur ous acid) currents which began the metamorphosis of the porphyry. These gases, piercing the dolomite, may have converted portions of it into gypsum and sulphate of magnesia ; and these being washed away the cavities remained. A change of conditions then took place, and while gases and silicious waters completed the transformation of the porphyry into quartzite, similar, but metalliferous, springs found their way into the cavities ofthe dolomite or limestone, and deposited there the metallic ores. This theory is strongly confirmed by the actual process now going on at the many hot springs of Nevada. But a thorough dis cussion of it would lead me too far. The mining operations in Cortez district have not been carried on with much wisdom or economy. The Cortez company, owning some of the best deposits, has made thus far a partial failure. The district is nearly but not quite abandoned. A few men are still at work, and doubtless the completion of the railroad, which passes within some 25 miles, will stimulate a renewal of operations. There is a steady, though limited, transportation of rich ore from Cortez to Austin for reduction. As the hauling costs some $45 per ton, and the milling about $45 more, it is evi dent that onlyr rich ore can be profitably handled in this way. The Saint Louis mine, next north of the Cortez, on the Nevada Giant, is steadily worked ; and the ore sent to mill has regularly increased in value and quantity during the present year, as appears from the assessor's reports, according to which there were reduced in Austin, from this mine \u2014 It is such formations as Hot Creek, Eeveille, Cortez, and White Pine, that reqmre skilful miners, and certainly revenge themselves upon the ignorance and carelessness of those who treat the irregular ore deposits as if they were simply fissure veins. The management of mines whicii show at one time rich bonanza, and at another time, nothing at all is a matter of difficulty ; and -when to this is added the small proprietorship of mines without capital, each man working with mingled extravagance and penuriousness his own petty claim, the certain result is' disappoint ment. l * Big Smoky district, about 12 miles from Austin, (five miles bv air line . in a southerly direction, and in the Toiyabe range.

There is no banded structure in the veins, or at least a very indistinct one. The silver ores are sil ver-copper-glance and native silver. In contact veins, between the granite-porphyry and belts of metamorphosed slates, occurs gold also, both free in the ferruginous outcrops and with pyrites in depth. Some veins in the slates, as for instance, the Big Smoky, appear to me to be merely large segregations of quartzite. Southward, towards Santa Fe, there is a zone of very steeply dipping sedimentary strata, comprising lime, dolomite, and slate. The slates contain faint'remains of corals, the age of whicii cannot, on present evidence, be determined. The limestone contains caves of considerable size, some of which can be entered from the deep canons which here intersect the mountains. Small crevices, one or two inches wide, in these caves contain a white or yellowish crystalline salt, soluble in water and containing nitrates of potassa, soda, and lime, and chloride of sodium. The largest streams in the Toiyabe flow through this district, and fine wood is abundant, (white pine aud cedar, as well as nut pine.) No ore has yet been obtained in the district that will pay for milling at present rates. A New York company, owning the Big Smoky mine, erected at great cost a handsome 20-stamp mill at the mouth of the Birch Creek canon, in Smoky valley. There were many tons of ore taken from the mine, (the estimate was 4,000 tons,) and supposed to be rich. If this was really the belief of the superintendent, he must have been deceived by spots of graphite in the quartz, mistaking them for silver glance. The mill has no roasting fur naces, and has never run but a few days, as the ore extracted at so much cost, and in such great quantity, was found to contain but $10 or $12 per ton. The Commercial company are at work with a long tunnel, which is to cross-cut the same ledge at a considerable depth. Of many mines which have been begun in the district, the Commercial is the only one now being worked. The rest are for the present abandoned. Santa Fe district, about 20 miles in a direct line, south of Austin, and in the Toiyabe range, which is here very precipitous, and rises some 5,000 feet \"above the level of Smoky valley. The formation is slate, much broken and disturbed by dikes and masses of greenstone, basalt, and porphyry. The principal vein of the district lies in the .slate, to which it conforms in dip aud strike. It is a porous mass of quartz, show ing no banded structure whatever, and, although cubes of iron pyrites have apparently been washed out of the outcrop by snows and rains, yet the mass is not at all ferruginous. One would hardly call such a deposit a vein. Yet this nondescript shows here and there handsome selvages aud casings, and even \" slickensides.\"* The vein matter con- tains fragments of slate, which often usurp the whole width of the vein. The ore of this \" Veta Madre,\" or mother lode, as it was called, contains only gold as obtainable metal. Wonderful specimens are said to have been discovered on the surface; but they have never been found in depth. The vein outcrop is distinct for several veins, and can be seen from the stage-road in the valley below, some five miles distant. It is the only vein ever worked in the district, and, so far as I know, the only one ever discovered.

A splendid roiid was cut along the face ofthe mountain to the mine; but the ore still continued to yield less than expenses, and the company finally abandoned the mine and, I believe, removed the mill to Newark, where it has recently produced a good deal of bullion from White Pine ore. Santa Fe district contains fine timber and water. The saw-mill formerly there furnished excellent lumber. The natural advantages of the location are such that some good mining engineers do not hesitate to say the Veta Madre may yet be worked with success, the ores being reduced in Kingston canon. Perhaps this will be the case when labor and provisions shall have grown cheaper. Bunker Rill and Summit districts are situated on the eastern slope of the Toiyabe range, about 25 miles south of Austin, and on both sides of Big Smoky creek, which flows into Smoky valley. The geological forma tion is argillaceous slates, interstratified with calcareous and graphitic slates, the whole being broken and uplifted in many places by dikes of greenstone and diorite. The ledges occur in the slates, or between them and the diorite, and generally coincide with the slates in dip aud strike. A few ledges run across the course of the country rock, but these are poorer in precious minerals than the others. There appears to be one mother lode in the district, with several subordinate ones parallel or only slightly divergent in course. The ores are antimonial sulphurets, chlo rides, &c, combined with considerable quantities of copper and lead minerals, such as malachite, azurite, aud silicate of copper, and carbon ate, chloride, and sulphate of lead, with occasionally* some galena. Gold occurs native in most of the ledges, and in some forms the most import ant constituent. Among the principal mines are the Victorine, Eeal del Monte, Gold Point, Ph\u0153nician, Brown, and Jackson. Much of the ore, especially in the first two, is stained with copper minerals. The porous ore from the Gold Point assay*s high in gold. A selected sample from this vein yielded by assay $220 12 per ton in silver, and $886 29 in gold. There is abundance of fuel in the district, and the stream flow ing through the caiion on both slopes of which the mines are situated is one of the largest that enter Smoky valley. The Sterling Silver Mining Company constructed a handsome twenty stamp mill, run by a turbine wheel, in the mining town of Kingston, in this district. The battery is one of the best in the State, and the capa city of the reverberatories is sufficient for the stamps. This enterprise was ruined by the failure of the mines on which it was based, and the company's mill is now owned by its creditors. Half a mile below the Sterling mill is the twenty-stamp mill erected by an eastern company for the treatment of the ore from the mother-lode in the neighboring Santa Fe district. This mill also failed on account of the poverty of the ore. C. Coover, a practical mill-man, in company with others, under the name of the Bunker Hill Mining Company, afterwards erected a five stamp mill, run by water-power, for wet crushing, without roasting. In this mill 1,000 tons of unassorted Victorine ore were worked, with an aggregate yield of $19,500. This mill has now been moved to White Pine. The ore of these districts is generally of low grade; but the large quantity in sight, and the ease with which, by means of tunnels, etc., it can be extracted, render inevitable a future recovery of the lost activity and the inauguration of a new prosperity. Northumberland district. \u2014 This district lies in the Mootay ran->e which lies opposite and parallel to thc Toiyabe, forming the eastern boundary of Smoky valley. Tl\"> district is about 25 miles south of the overland"], [97, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 85 road, and the same distance north of Belmont. The principal rocks are granite, (chloritic and syenitic,) porphyry, (generally much decomposed,) and lime. The mines occur almost exclusively in porphyry. The ores are sulphantimoniurets, (ruby silver, etc.,) with the usual products of decomposition, (chlorides, etc.,) and occasionally copper minerals, such as malachite and azurite. The principal veins are the Northumberland, Lady Cummings, and Detroit; but there are, as usual, numerous loca tions the value of which is unknown as yet. From the Northumberland and Lady Cummings some 20 tons of ore were sent to Austin last year, and yielded, it is said,* from $ 70 to $ 150 per ton. The Quintero Company have recently erected a ten-stamp mill, with roasting furnaces, to work ore from the Northumberland vein. The machinery was obtained by dismantling Hunt's mill at San Antonio. Considerable money was expended in miners' dwellings, etc., and the mill closed soon after start ing, on account of financial embarrassments. The Northumberland is a large vein, but the ore is of low grade. Wood is abundant in this district, and water is supplied by several springs. White Pine district was organized in 1865, but did not become the scene of successful operations until the fall and winter of 1867, when the rich mines of Treasure Hill were located. Previous to that time a com pany, called the Monte Cristo, was engaged, with no very flattering prospects, in the development of certain mineral veins on White Pine mountain, from which the district derives its name. It is said that an Indian, seeing the ore piled in the Monte Cristo mill, offered to make known a place where there was plenty of such material, and guided a party to Treasure Hill, sixteen miles distant, where the Hidden Treasure mine was located September 14, 1867. The White Pine mountain, so called from the species of timber with which it is abundantly covered, is about 120 miles south of east from Austin, and 60 miles southwest from Egan canon, a station on the over land road. It is said to be situated in latitude 39\u00b0 10' north, and longi tude 38\u00b0 30' west. The mountain is ten or twelve miles long, and rises boldly some 2,000 feet above the level valleys, having a total altitude of perhaps 10,000 feet above the sea. On the western slope are the veins first discovered, some of which were worked by the Monte Christo Com pany above mentioned. They are said to have been tolerably rich, but small. Parallel with White Pine mountain, on the east, is a ridge some 1,500 feet lower, and five or six miles long, in which mineral veins occur carrying ores of silver considerably contaminated with baser metals. This is called the Base Eange. Still farther east is the mountain known as Treasure Hill. It is comparatively bare of timber, about 9,000 feet above the sea, and separated by deep canons on every side from sur rounding ranges. All these mountains have a generally north and south course. _ The geological formation ofthe district is extremely simple, resembling that of all the so-called limestone districts of Nevada. An upheaval of limestone strata by porphyry, and a subsequent metamorphosis ot struc ture by solfataric and thermal-aqueous action, is evidently indicated. My brief examination did not extend to the minute local details of the for mation, but I believe this neighborhood, when thoroughly studied, will throw much light on the geology of other districts, where the effects ot these agencies are more obscure and the exposures of rock less exten sive and distinct. ...-._. j.. +. The limestone strata of Treasure Hill have been tdted from the east, 'See J. Ross Browne's last report, page 423."], [98, "86 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES and have a general course north and south, and a dip of about 20\u00b0 west. The uppermost layers now remaining from the extensive denudation which has degraded aU the mountains of Nevada form a rugged summit of limited area, which has been (strangely enough) described as \"trap, but consists of highly fossiliferous limestone, containing mainly crinoids. Below this is a thin stratum of calcareous shales, colored yellow and red with iron, and beneath these again is the limestone stratum in which the rich deposits of silver ore occur. This limestone is highly siliceous, and contains little or no traces of fossils so far as I can learn at present. The eastern side of Treasure Hill is precipitous, and exposes the out crops of successive strata ; and here it may be seen that fossiliferous limestone appears again beneath the metalliferous layers. It is believed by many that a second stratum of ore-bearing rock will be found beneath the lower fossiliferous limestone, but this has not been proved. Across the canon to the eastward the precipitous face of a parallel range shows the continuations of the limestone strata ; but the range is of inferior height, and the upper metalliferous layer is consequently wanting, hav ing probably been carried away by denudation. This range dips east ward, and the caiion between it and Treasure Hill probably occupies an anticlinal axis. \" The formation of the White Pine district,\" says an otherwise intelli gent correspondent, \" is an anomaly, and sets at defiance all known laws and rules of geology.\" This is the common expression of miners and tourists, readily adopted by speculators, who have learned by experience that \" anomalies\" sell best in the market. The truth is, there is nothing unusual in the formation of the district, except the enormous value of its ores. These occur in irregular masses and impregnations throughout a certain stratum of the limestone, and, fortunately for the miners, this stratum is the very one which the processes of disintegration and denu dation have left uppermost. The ore consists of chloride of silver, with some enargite and stetefeldtite, and (in rare instances) native silver in capillary form. Of the extent of the deposits nothing can be said at present. They are probably bounded above and below by the planes of stratification, but laterally they seem scarcely to be separated from one another \u2014 what has been considered barren rock between them being mainly low-grade ore, which will hereafter be extracted like the rest. The accompanying minerals are quartz and calc-spar. The copper stains upon most of the ore showthat this metal was a constituent ofthe original deposits; and I conclude that the remarkable purity of the chloride ore of the Treasure Hill mines is the residt of chemical changes subsequent to their original formation, in the course of which soluble chlorides, sulphates, and bicarbonates have been removed. It is possi ble, therefore, that the ore deposits of Treasure Hill have a common ori gin with those of the Base Eange, and that the present differences are due to the concentrating and purifying action of thermal waters carry ing chemical reagents in solution. There is no radical distinction in nature between the filling of a fissure and that of a cavity in limestone. The metalliferous fluids, whether solfataric gases, aqueous solutions, or molten masses, find their way wherever an opening is offered, aud leave their deposits wherever they are checked for a sufficient time to cool or evaporate, or wherever they meet with chemical agencies which produce in them insoluble precipitates. Experience has shown that upheavals of stratified limestone do not generally produce fissures so extensive and well-defined as occur in some other kinds of rock. The solubility of the limestone itself in carbonated waters, especially under high heat and pressure, tends both to fill up the fissure with calc-spar and to open out-"], [99, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 87 lets from it into irregular cavities, and, finally, to cause a general altera tion (sihcification, often) of the country rock, and its impregnation with the metallic contents of mineral waters. Hence the miner's maxim, that lime is a \" good gaugue, but a poor country.\" The ore deposits of Treasure Hill are richer than any that have been discovered during the present century ; but, according to till the data that have yet been collected, , they are not fissure veins. These data, though they all point one way, are necessiirily incomplete, since no shaft on the hill is deeper than 60 feet, and no horizontal drift longer than 100 feet. Not long before my visit, the miners of the district held a meeting, at which they were strongly urged to adopt at once the system of \" square locations,\" and abandon the farce of staking out claims on ledges which do not exist. This proposition was defeated ; and every man on Treasure Hill now claims so many feet of a vein, running, he does not specify in what direction, and dipping, he cannot tell .it what angle, from a hole which he has made at random in the neighborhood of some already exposed body of ore. If he gets down to the ore, all the better ; he can then work night and day, extract a large quantity of rich chloride, and send it away, before the neighbor, who has a prior location, can prove the identity of the deposit. In the utter absence of any real distinctive features of lodes, the principle has been set up by the White-Piners, that proof of such identity must consist iu absolute continuity of chlo ride of silver from the working of the prior locator to those ofthe alleged trespasser. In one case, that of the Eberhardt and Blue Bell, this astounding demand was satisfied. A drift from the Eberhardt opening 30 feet to the Blue Bell shaft, passed through a mass of horn-silver, such as human eyes have rarely looked upon ; and, as a consequence, the Blue Bell was united to the Eberhardt. The Keystone is, without the shadow of a doubt, on the same deposit as the Eberhardt. There is only a wall of two feet between them ; but this wall is amicably let alone, and the \" two veins\" are therefore held by miners' law to be distinct ! In another case which came to our knowledge, a claimant was endeavoring to protect himself from robbery, by tracing the ore into the works of a new-comer, close by, and had successfully arrived within a yard of his object, when the occurrence of a piece of calc-spar across his path defeated him. The intruder, protected by that bulwark, laughed his claims to scorn, and continued to extract and carry away the ore, which was, under miners' law, in a distinct vein, separated from the other by a \" wall.\" All the \"walls\" thus far discovered on Treasure Hill are of this wholly indefinite and untrustworthy character \u2014 mere seams of calc-spar in lime stone ; and, under the present regulations, there is no such thing as security of title. Even if one had a regular fissure vein, he might be cheated out of all but a few feet of it by some accidental shoot of calc-spar across it ; and when we consider that calc and limestone are chemically the same, and that a little trickling of water might deposit one of these so-called walls anywhere, we shall see what protection is offered to capi tal by such a rule as has been adopted in White Pine. This is an instance of the danger of allowing the first miners in any district to make, without limitation, such laws as they please, governing the rights of property. This splendid district is now subjected to two styles of operations\u2014 grabbing on the spot, and gambling away from it, A great many worthy, honest, and industrious men are at work there; but they will acknowledge that they are merely putting off the evil day of litigation and chaos. Others are interested in claims, which they want to sell to capitalists ; and they may sincerely believe their claims to be"], [100, "88 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES vabd and well-defined. No one is accused of intentional deception m the matter ; it is only to be lamented that the inhabitants did not, by adopting at once a rational basis for mining titles, introduce order among conflicting claims. To their credit be it spoken, there has been thus far little quarrelling among them. White Piue has been notably a quiet, industrious, and good-natured mining camp. But that is because there was room for all, and profitable work for all. Unless some radical change, of which I have now no knowledge, has taken place since my visit in September, White Pine is a good place for men who live there, and can watch and defend their own interests, and for custom-mills, which will doubtless do a good business for months to come, in reducing the marvellously rich ores of the different deposits; but I must again repeat that I cannot find in the circumstances of the case any protection for permanent investment of capital. Some of the mines, as for instance the Hidden Treasure and the Virginia, standing a little apart from the great crowd, already extensively worked, and having moreover a sem blance at least of defiuiteness in their deposits, are better off than others; but they all suffer under the absurd regulations of the miners. It is the natural tendency, when men with nothing but their own industry to depend upon gather in a new district, that they should make such laws as will favor industry, and that only. When I was in White Pine, many a man with pick and shovel, and now and theu a little gun powder, was making good wages out of his small prospecting shaft. The retail mining business suited him well enough ; but capital must work on a larger scale. Insecurity of title is no trouble to one who, if he is ejected to-day, can pack up his tools, move away a rod or two, and have a new mine iu full blast to-morrow ; but capital requires a certain basis for the investment of its thousands in permanent works. The only cure for this evil now possible, is that which the inhabitants may themselves supply, by uniting conflicting claims, and arranging amicably their boundaries. Perhaps it is not too late to establish square locations by general agreement, and to adjust the claims for damages that may arise from such a change by means of a commission elected by the citizens. I adopt, with such alterations and additions as my notes of personal observation suggest, the following account of different mines, &c, from the letter of a San Francisco Alta California correspondent, who visited the district in November, two months after I left it: The mines from which nine-tenths of the treasure now being produced in the White Pine district is being taken are located along the broken edge of the dolomite formation, in a line running southwards from the town of Hamilton up to the summit of Treasure Hill, and thence in the same direction over the declivity on the other side. The length of this lode or line of deposits is, so far as is known, between two and three miles \u2014 say about that of the Comstock ; the Virginia at the northern end answering, for the purpose of illustration, for the Ophir and Gould and Curry, and the Aurora, Keystone, and Eberhardt, near the south, for the Crown Point, Kentuck, and Yellow Jacket. The principal claims thus far opened along this line of deposits are located in succession, as follows, commencing at the northern end: Virginia, Mammoth, Ellersly, north of the crest of Treasure Hill; Hidden Treasure, near the summit; South Extension of Hidden Treasure, North Aurora, South Aurora, Keystone, and Eberhardt. There are numerous other localities along this line, or nearly parallel with it on the west, but these are the principal claims opened. There is an apparent break iu the line of deposits, as evinced by the croppings at the crest of the hill, south of the Hidden Treasure and north of the Aurora; but from that point south the deposits crop out so near together that they may practically be said to be continuous."], [101, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 89 Virginia.\u2014 Located at the northern end of the Treasure Hill belt, or line of deposits, half a mile south of Hamilton, and 500 feet higher. This claim is situated on the eastern side of a ravine near the top of a ridge, running north and south. It includes 600 feet north and south, and 200 feet in width from east to west. It has been but partially opened, but the ore crops out nearly its whole length, at points from 40 to GO feet apart, east and west, and at a depth of 20 feet, solid rock, with a large, well-defined pay streak of bonanza, has been exposed. On the top of the ridge, above the Virginia shaft, a claim was located, and called the Aladdin's Lamp. This claim ran directly across the Virginia, and though the prior claim exhibited no evidence of a ledge, excavations on the Alad din's Lamp ground soon disclosed rich ore in detached masses, and the whole hill appears to be full of it. The Virginia ore, though not so exceedingly rich as that of the Eberhardt and Keystone, which is so near pure silver as to be hardly describable as ore, runs from $100 to $2,000 per ton, the average being probably not under $225. Sixteen tons recently crushed and worked yielded $226 net per ton. Hidden Treasure. \u2014 This mine was discovered by an Indian, who guided white men to it, September 14, 1867. There was considerable secrecy maintained for a time, but the facts which were attempted to be sup pressed soou leaked out, and the result led to the discovery of the great Keystone and Eberhardt deposits, lower down the hill, on the south, and the sudden development of the whole district. The present owners are T. J. Murphy and J. E. Marcband. It includes 600 feet. The line of deposits has been stripped for nearly the entire length of the claim, and in places to a depth of 20 feet. The lode, if such it may be called, pitches westward at an angle of 20 degrees, and its thickness has not yet been clearly determined. Three hundred tons of the ore \u2014 no rich speci mens included \u2014 hauled to the Monte Cristo mill, on the west side of White Pine mountain, 16 miles by the road via Hamilton, yielded $160 per ton. The cost of reducing it was $65 per ton. Next year it will cost not over $20 per ton to reduce the same ore. The owners now have 100 tons of ore of superior quality out ready for crushing, and the lode is increasing in richness. The mine is entirely uncovered, and no work will be done on it after the heavy snows fall, until next spring. Picked specimens show horn-silver in abundance, worth $1,000 per ton and upwards. Aurora. \u2014 This mine is located on the south of the crest of Treasure Hill\u2014 the Hidden Treasure being on the north\u2014 and just east of the town of Treasure Hill. This is properly the South Aurora, the North Aurora being above it, near the summit of the hill, and being but little devel oped. Work was commenced ou it with two men, September 22, 1868; 30 men are now worked. One hundred and fifty tons of rock from this mine, worked at the Newark mill, in the Diamond range, 90 miles to the northwest of Hamilton, yielded an average of $185 per ton\u2014 the highest being $202, and the lowest $155. The cost of hauling was $20 per ton, and of working $35. There is more quartz here than lower down the hill on either side, and the indications of a regularly defined deposit are better than elsewhere. The shaft is 20 feet deep, and the drift westward 60 feet. The entrance to the miue is roofed over, and work can be carried on all winter. \u25a0 . SJl\u00b1 tlLtS III'U-J. . Keystone.\u2014 Descending the hill southward past a number of claims, we come upon the Keystone, which is situated some distance below the edge of the dolomite croppings, on the eastern face of the hill. Here the chloride deposit crops out in almost incredible richness, and the develop ments are astonishing. The claim covers 800 feet, and the deposit was discovered by a party following \" float\" ore up the hill from the ravine"], [102, "90 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES below. At the point where the shaft now is, one of the party, a mere lad, named John Turner, struck a pick into what seemed to be a mass of dried putty. This proved to be pure chloride of silver, worth $15,000 to $25,000 per ton, and under it was found more of the same sort, and masses of almost pure metallic silver. The original location was mixed up with that of the Eberhardt, but a compromise has been effected ; a neutral line, beyond which neither is to pass, has been agreed on, and on the 1st of August next the two claims are to be consolidated. At present each company works its own ground. The amount already taken out of the Keystone is not stated by the owners, but it is very large, and all came ous of an opening in the hill, not more than 50 feet long horizontally, and 20 feet deep. A shaft has been sunk 60 feet through successive layers of dolomite, at the entrance of this open cut, and ore is said to have been found at the bottom. Much of the wealth of this mine consists of dull yellowish brown colored dust, which is run through screens to free it from rock, and placed in bags. This is clear chloride of silver. One piece of this chloride, shown me while at the mine, weighed 143 pounds and was worth, as it lay on the ground, over $1,500 in coin. In one pile were 100 tons of ore which will work $300 person; iu another, 150 tous which will yield $300 to $500 per ton ; in another, 600 tons which will yield $100 and upwards; iu another a large pile of chloride dust in bags, worth \u2014 one hesitates to say how much. Two lots of the ore from this mine, worked at the Newark mill and the Manhattan mill, at Austin, yielded an average of $1,000 per ton, or $100,000 in the aggregate. Eberlutrdt. \u2014 Next south, and adjoining the Keystone, is the most cele brated of all \u2014 the Eberhardt. So rich is this mine that its name has become almost synonymous with that of the cave entered by Aladdin. The location was made in December, 1867, and covers 800 feet, north and south.* At a depth of 20 or 30 feet from the surface drifts have been run iu several directions through solid masses of chlorides, and other ores of silver for 20 to 50 feet, and the end is not yet reached. Tlie entrance of the tunnel has been closed, aud admission to the mine can now only be gained by descending the vertical shaft in the company's building. Descending the shaft on a rope, we found ourselves among men engaged in breaking down silver by the ton. The light of our candles disclosed great black sparkling masses of silver ore on every side. The walls were silver, the roof over our heads silver, the very dust which filled our lungs and covered our boots and clothing was a gray coating of fine silver. Prom a chimney in the Eberhardt ground $85,000 worth of silver was taken in a few days, aud the party taking it out then compromised with thc company, being allowed to hold all he had taken out and release to the Eberhardt company the ground in dispute. The silver is now piled up in a cabin at Treasure Hill. The proprietors have $50,000 worth of similar specimens piled up in another place. One of the owners of the Eberhardt, but recently a poor man, values his interest at $1,000,000, and we presume the others would refuse to sell for less money. Down the long canon a road leads to Silver Springs, where the Oasis mill, now owned and run by the Eberhardt company is situated. This is the old Keystone mill, which was burned at Austin last summer Mr. Page, after settling with the underwriters, took the machinery to this place and rebuilt it. It has ten stamps, eight Varney pans and three settlers. No roasting, chlorination, or other expensive process is employed ; the wet process of crushing aud direct amalgamation known as the Washoe process, being found for the present sufficientlv remunera- * Or, according to White Pine law, in any other direction which the locators may subse quently choose, lhe present assumed course is nearly east and west, I believe.\u2014 R. W R"], [103, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 91 tive, Mr. Page erected the mill on a contract to work the Eberhardt and other ores ; but the company soon found it for their advantage to purchase the establishment. The mill cost $30,000, and the mill and con tract were sold to the company for $75,000. Chloride Flat is a slope comprising from five to ten acres on the west ern side of the hill, adjoining the town of Treasure Hill. It is perfo rated like a sieve with shafts, sunk often within from 10 to 30 feet of each other. The holders claim 400, 600, or 1,000 feet each, and the claims, being located on the old ledge theory, run into each other, cross and interlace in every direction. At present the lucky holders of claims in which metal has been struck are too busy getting out rich horn silver and other forms ofthe metal to quarrel with each other, but as soon as they work out the horizontal deposits, and run into each others' claims, as they soon will, shooting and lawsuits will be the order of the day in what is now a peaceful and highly prosperous community. The great mistake of organizing the district on the perpendicular ledge theory \u2014 each claimant being allowed 200 feet on the ledge, \" with all his dips, spurs, and angles,\" and the discoverer 200 feet in addition \u2014 was made at the outset, and it is now too late to remedy it. Had the lociition been made by the square yard it would have been all right, and many a law suit and shooting affray saved. Already difficulties are arising iu the vicinity of the Eberhardt, and more must follow. From 10 to 30 feet through the limestone brings the prospector on Chloride Flat to his deposit of silver, or to the certainty that he has missed it and must seek elsewhere. The owners of the Bobert Emmet mine, on Chloride Flat, who are taking out rich horn silver, reject as base rock, unworthy of being worked, all yielding less than $50 per ton. This deposit is at least seven feet thick, and not yet worked through. The Gene see, Stonewall, Delmonico and other mines in the vicinity, are among the richest on the Flat. There are 1,500 locations recorded in this district, and of this number 500 at least are within rifle shot of the above named mines. There are three towns in the district, Hamilton, north of Treasure Hill ; Silver Springs or Shermantown, south of the hill, and Treasure City in the midst of the miues upon the hill itself. Chloride City is a part, I believe, of Treasure City. Hamilton, the town which has grown up in the canon at the entrance of the hills on the north, contains perhaps 600 inhabitants. From thence a graded road winds up the hill to Treasure City, which stands below the crest of Treasure Hill, within the line of rich mines named on the east and Chloride Flat on the west. Here the principal mining population is congregated, the inhabitants (regular and transitory) numbering from 800 to 1,000. The distance from Hamilton to Treasure City is not over one and one-half miles in a direct line, though two and one-half by the toll road, and the difference in altitude is estimated at from 1,000 to 1,200 eet. The town of Silver Springs, sometimes called Shermantown, is located at the southern end of the Base Metal Range, two miles south w*est of Treasure Hill, the road winding down a deep canon to reach it. It is probably 1,500 feet lower than the town of Treasure City, or 7,500 feet above the level of the sea, and containing 400 or 500 people. Hamilton has a supply of water, and is the stage and express depot, and the primary depot for supplies for the district, Treasure Hill is exposed to the full sweep ofthe winds on the summit ofthe mountain, and has no water save what is hauled up there from Hamilton or Silver Springs and sold at eight cents per gallon, but it is in the heart of the mineral deposits, and must be an important place despite its unpleasant ocation."], [104, "92 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES Silver Springs is sheltered from the winds, and is the more desira ble\u2014rather endurable\u2014 place of residence. Hamilton was first called Cave City, from a number of caves below the town in which the people first found shelter. It consists of board and cloth shanties, tents, and brush, rock and earth cabins. Treasure Hill ditto. Silver Spring has two or three good brick buildings, and is generally better built than either of the others. There is a saw mill, quartz mill, brick yard, (not now in operation,) and large slaughter-house, at Hamilton ; two banks and .sev eral assay offices at Treasure Hill ; aud a quartz mill, smelting furnaces, assay office, and saw mill at Silver Springs. The entire population of the district may be put down at 2,500 or 3,000 at this time, and increas ing at the rate of 50 per day. A very few women have found their way into the district, but as yet'there can hardly be said to be anything like female society there. The wages paid in the mines are $5 per day, coin, and those not at work for themselves get employment easily at some thing, if so disposed. Lots whicii sold <it $25 in Hamilton and Treasure Hill two or three months since are now in many cases worth $600 to $1,200, and \"jumping\" is as lively as in San Francisco, though attended as yet by no bloodshed. Nearly every building spot along the road, from Hamilton up to and through Treasure Hill and down to Sdver Springs, is already claimed by somebody, and holders always ask an advance on yesterday's prices. The climate \u2014 Necessary outfit. \u2014 The peculiarities of the climate of White Pine are not so well known as they will be when the district shall have been inhabited for a few years, instead of less than a year. Treasure Hill is from 8,000 to 9,000 feet above the level of the sea, and exposed to the full sweep ofthe winter winds, which are fearfully severe at times between the Eocky mountains and Sierra Nevada. Spring is late, cold, and wet ; summer short, dry, aud tolerably pleasant ; autumn long and pleasant, with fine days and cold, frosty, freezing nights. It is reported that snow falls to a depth of 15 feet on the White Pine range in winter, but this story is not well authenticated, and the vegetation and general appearance of the country would lead to the belief that the annual fall is not extremely large. Up to the 20th instant there were but a few inches of snow on the highest peak of the White Pine mountains, and only au inch or two, iu scattered patches, on Treasure Hill and tlie Base Eauge. It was snowing on the 20th and 21st on the Toiyabe and other rauges south and southeast of Austin, aud probably also at White Pine, but the storm did not appear to be of long- duration. The win ter, however, must be intensely cold, and those who propose to remain there until spring must be well provided with good heavy woollen under clothing, heavy pilot, beaver or blanket cloth outer-clothing, and at least two pairs of the heaviest and best San Francisco or Oregon blankets \u2014 the best are the cheapest in the end, and will always find ready sale. It is difficult to get goods over the railroad at this time promptly, owing to the pressure of material for extending the line, which must go forward whether or no; but parties intending wintering in the mines must either take over a stock of provisions, and have them hauled from Argenta, or go provided with means to purchase them at Hamilton day by day for four or five months, probably at an advance on the prices quoted below as the present ruling rates. The climate appears to be exceedingly healthy, but owing to the great elevation of the country, and consequent rarefaction of the atmosphere, no person with weak lungs should attempt to winter there. Colds, rheumatism, and fevers will doubtless prevail to some extent before spring, as the result of exposure, ueglect, and carelessness."], [105, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 93 Present cost of Urine/.* \u2014 At present the necessaries of life are high priced, but of good quality and abundant. At Hamilton and Treasure Hill are quite a number of restaurants at which a tolerably good meal may be obtained. The price per meal is $1, and board by the week is $12. There is no hotel in the district, and but one or two places where a bunk to sleep iu can be rented. The price of a single bunk bed, with a mattrass and blankets, at the store of Wakefield & Wheeler, in which Wells, Fargo & Co.'s office is kept, in Hamilton, is $1 per night. This is the general resort of all new-comers, and a man who is in season tobe booked for a bunk is looked upon as a favored mortal. Others, less for tunate, sleep in their blankets on the floor of the store, in saloons, res taurants, tents, hovels, or in the open air, as they can catch it. The prices of various articles of food for man and beast are as follows : Flour, $16 per hundred pounds ; potatoes, (grown in Nevada and of superior quality,) 12J cents per pound; onions, 15 cents per pound; sugar, (brown,) 3\u00a3 pounds for $1 ; crushed sugar, 3 poundsfor $1 ; coffee, (ground,) 75 cents per pound \u2014 (no facilities for grinding it in the district;) bacon, (sides,) 37\u00a3 cents; hams, 37 J and 40 cents; shoulders, 35 cents per pound ; beef, fresh and of good quality, 25 cents ; pork, 37|\u00ae50 cents per pound; eggs, from Salt Lake, (so-soish,) $1\u00ae$1 25 per dozen; eggs, (fresh,) $2 per dozen; tea,$l 25perpound; candles, 35 cents per pound ; barley, 10^12^ cents per pound; hay, $150 per ton ; drinks, 25 cents each, and no credit at the bar. Wood of good quality is abundant, and can be had for the cost of catting aud hauling. All the wood land in the vicinity is being claimed by parties who propose to cut wood for the mills and to supply the miners. Lumber costs $150 per 1,000 feet for ordinary, $175 per 1,000 feet for choice at Hamilton, where there is a little steam saw-mill with a single circular saw constantly engaged in cutting lumber from the \" bull pine,\" (or \" nigger pine,\" as it would be termed in the south,) which grows on the White Pine mountain proper, in considerable quantities, and of sufficient size to afford saw logs 20 to 25 feet in length and two feet thick. At Treasure Hill $200 and upwards per 1,000 feet is charged for boards, which are hauled from Hamilton or Silver Springs, or from remote districts by heavy teams. Half a dozen men clubbing together could in a few days put up a shanty of cedar posts chinked with stones and mud, and roofed with cedar boughs and earth, which would afford comparatively comfortable quarters for the party through the winter. Those erecting buildings of sawed lumber at present line them with cot ton cloth to exclude the wind, then shingle or tin the roofs. A horse will \" eat his head off\" in a week or two, and parties coming into the dis trict at this time will do well to send them off to the lower valleys, 20 to 50 miles away, where they can winter on bunch grass and white sage in the open air, only requiring the attention of a herder. Clothing and blankets cost about 50 per cent, more than in San Francisco. There are as yet, no agricultural developments in the district itself. Some fine ranches on the road to Austin produce hay and grain, and considerable coarse hay is cut in the next valley eastward. Teams from Salt Lake via Egan canon have found their way m great numbers to the White Pine cities, and their owners have done a flourishing business m e-rain, vegetables, etc. . . Mills and reduction worles.\u2014 The Oasis mill at Silver Sprmgs,(10 stamps,) the White Pine mill at Hamilton, (10 stamps,) and the Monte Onsto, * Since this chapter was written, in November, 1868. the great influx of prospectors and speculators into White Pine may have enhanced these prices still further."], [106, "94 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES (5 stamps,) are, I bebeve, all running. The old Butte mill, (5 stamps,) from Sau Francisco canon, Eeese Eiver district, has been transported to White Pine, aud will soon be in operation. There are also two smelting furnaces, which will start in the spring, for the treatment of the richest ores, and of the ores from the Base range. The product of White Pine for 1868, including the value of the ore extracted, but uot yet reduced, may fairly be estimated at a million dollars, perhaps more, At present there is but one route by which the White Pine district can be reached from San Francisco, viz: via the Central Pacific railroad, Argenta and Austin. The distance from San Francisco in round figures is about as follows : San Francisco to Sacramento, by rail or steamer, 100 miles ; Sacramento to Argenta, by rail 400 miles ; Argenta to Austin, by stage, 97 miles ; Austin to Hamilton, by stage, 120 miles\u2014 total, 717 miles. The cost of the trip for passage alone, only 25 pounds of baggage being allowed, is as follows : To Sacramento $5, to Argenta $40, to Aus tin $15, to Hamilton $25\u2014 total, $85. After passing Eeno, meals are $1 each along the whole route, and $15 is a moderate allowance for the ex pense of eating on the way, which would bring the cost of the trip to $100 in round figures, providing one has no extra baggage, does not stop to sleep on the way, and indulges in no luxuries. By purchasing a through ticket at Sacramento for Austin $10 can be saved on the above estimate, but the stage by which one engages passage from Argenta to Austin may be filled in advance, in which case it may be necessary to remain for days at the former point. If no detention occurs, and travelling is kept up night and day, the trip through from San Francisco to Hamilton may be made in five days. There are two regular stage lines, Wells, Fargo & Co.'s mail line and Miller, Wadleigh & Co.'s passenger aud fast freight line, running between Argenta and Austin. Between Austin and Hamilton there are two regular stage lines, viz: Len Wine's (connecting with Wells, Fargo & Co.) and Shannon's and half a dozen guerilla lines, which make about half as good time as a man can make on foot. Fare the same all round. Ina few weeks \u2014 the weather permitting \u2014 it will be possible to reduce the staging on the trip by one-half. From Hamilton to the nearest point at which the railroad can be reached \u2014 near Fort Halleck, east of Grav elly Ford \u2014 the distance is not over 110 miles, possibly not more than 100. The new road will leave Austin far to the westward, and passing down an open valley country directly northwards, will present no heavy grades. It can be constructed cheaply, aud must be opened immediately. It may run through Euby valley, or it may leave it to the right, aud pass to the westward. There are now probably 3,000 people in White Pine district aud vicinity wholly without mail facilities, aud dependent solely ou Wells, Fargo & Co., for their letters, papers, &c. A mail route should aud probably will be opened between the railroad, near Fort Hal leck, and Hamilton immediately on the cars reaching the former point. The future productiveness and importance of this district caunot now be foreseen ; but much may be expected from the active explorations of next season, in a broad belt of countiy as yet comparatively unknown. As for the deposits of Treasure Hill, they are certain to yield large amounts of silver before they are exhausted ; and the prospects of the mines would be most encouraging, but for the confusion and waste which an injudicious system of titles will be certain to generate."], [107, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 95 SOCIAL AND STEPTOE MINE, EGAN CANON. Social and Steptoe mine, Egan canon, Nevada. Profile, 100 feet to the inch. Course of the vein, northeast and southwest magnetic, (variation 16\u00b0 east, ) and dip 50\u00b0 to 60c northwest ; A A, main incline ; B, prospecting shaft ; C, shaft in ravine, to be con- nected as air-shaft with the mine ; D, drift northeast on the vein, cut off at D by a green- stone dike, beyond which the vein has not yet been found ; 1 1, 2 2, workable ground com- puted to contain 20,200 tons of ore, worth $60 per ton and upwards ; 3 3, reserves containing within the length ot E E and depth of A, 6,800 tons of ore. The vein has been stripped and distinctly shown along the outcrop for 500 to 600 feet southwest of incline A. Egan canon is a pass of great natural beauty, traversed by the over- laud road, about 250 miles west of Salt lake, and half as far east of Austin.^ I believe the name of the mining district here organized is Gold canon. It has been the scene of some mining \" excitement,\" but operations are at present confined to a small arastra gold mill, which is said to be paying on a limited scale, and the mine of the Social aud Step- toe Consolidated Company, on the Gilligan vein. The mountain range through which Egan canon rims has a north and south course, aud con- sists of slates, quartzite, and porphyry, (or altered sandstone,) wliich is highly ferruginous. On the east side there is a kind of trap, and run- ning north tind south through the centre a greenstone dike ; the strata dip west being apparently tilted by the trappean rocks. The Gilligan vein shows itself along the northern mountain side in the canon. It has been traced on the surface, or in depth, for more than 1,000 feet horizon- tally, and the mine workings have attained a depth of 400 feet. Every- where there is a ledge of four to five and more feet, averaging four and one-half feet, carrying quartz with some calcspar and decomposed auri- ferous silver ore. The ore originally contained, probably, argentiferous galena aud antimonial suliihurets. It has been tested for four years past in a little five-stamp mill belonging to the company, which has pro- duced in all some $80,000 bullion from ore running from $50 to $150 per ton. The superintendent, Mr. O'Doughcrty, and Judge Eiley, estimate that 3,000 tons are now lying on the dumps, which will yield $50 per ton. The bulhon from this ore is worth $2 per ounce, on account of its gold contents. The mine is an excellent one and remarkably well opened. The reserves of 27,000 tons above calculated do not include the ground outside of the 300 feet opeued by the level E. By drifting along the whole length of the lode traced, (1,000 feet,) ground of great"], [108, "96 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES. extent and value will be opened at httle expense. This enterprise is ripe for a good mill; and the company are taking steps to put up one. The development of the mine has been slow but sure, and now the harvest may be gathered. If the rich mines of Eeese river, Twin river, and some other districts, had been opened to the depth of 400 feet, and all necessary levels ruu, before actual exploitation on a large scale was begun, they would have realized much greater profit, and for a longer time. Premature extraction of ore has well-nigh ruined some of the best mines in Nevada, Mr. O'Dougherty is to be congratulated on having pursued a contrary course. Egan canon being in Lander county, the yield of the mines is reported to the assessor at Austin. Product of mines. \u2014 The only means for arriving at the product ofthe mines of Nevada, outside of the Comstock, is afforded by the returns of the county assessors ; these are unfortunately made out with considerable irregularity, and are especially liable to error from the fact that all values are calculated in currency, according to the State law, for pur- poses of taxation. I applied for these returns to all the assessors in the State, but was only able to obtaiu in time those of Lander county for the first three quarters of 1868. The tables subjoiued have been partly copied and partly calculated, by myself, from the memoranda furnished. Tlie grand totals are correct, and the different items approximately so. The designation \" chloriders\" is given to parties who bring in small lots of ore, without reporting the mine from which they obtained it. In the second quarter there were 109 of these, but they are now considerably diminished in Eeese Eiver district, by the stampede to White Pine. assessor's returns OF BULLION-PRODUCING mines of lander county.

This sum includes the bullion of Nye county, aud possibly of some other localities. Railroads.\u2014 The great benefits which Humboldt and the northern part of Lander county have experienced already from the construction of the Pacific railroad naturally indicate a most important means of developing and maintaining the industry of central Nevada. Nature has provided, in the series of magnificent level valleys which stretch from north to south through the State, a system of highways unequalled in the world. Eeese Eiver, Smoky, Steptoe, and other valleys, along the sides of which are located numerous mining districts, offer extraordinary facilities for the laying of railroads, and at no distant day, when the supply of fuel has become in many localities insufficient, no doubt the ores will have to be transported to the more favored localities on the Pacific railroad for reduction. Eeno, on the Truckee river, is expected to become an important centre for operations of this kind, and the Cen tral railroad is extending every facility to those who desire to ship ores for treatment. The route for a cross-railroad must be determined by more careful examinations hereafter. In some respects an oblique route, traversing the mountain ranges by the low passes which abound in most of them, would be the most beneficial. At all events, it seems advisable that such a road should terminate, if possible, in an agricul tural district. I am inclined to believe that a road might easily be con structed, say through Eeese Eiver valley, and through a pass in Esme ralda county, into the Owens Eiver valley, California. This is, at least, the opinion of intelligent men, and I have examined a part of the route and found it quite feasible. Probably the first step towards a cross-railroad system will be the construction of short branches from the Pacific railroad to the nearest mining districts. The railroad proposed to Virginia City is an example; and if the developments at White Pine increase in importance, the con nection of that district with the Pacific road at Gravelly Ford (110 miles) may be undertaken, as the road would lead through a level valley most of the way. One such road, reaching into the heart of the silver-mining districts of Nevada, would effect wonders for their future prosperity. The same may be said of the proposed northern lines, connecting Idaho and Montana with the Pacific railroad. An interesting discussion of this subject will be found in the section on Montana. The policy of granting land in aid of such enterprises is heartily to be recommended. The government is not only enabled to double the price of the alternate sections which it retains, but to sell them at that double price; whereas, without the railroads, such lands are of no value to anybody. CHAPTEE VIII. NYE COUNTY. Mammoth district, situated about 00 miles west of south from Austin, and 12 miles west of the Union district, on the Mammoth range of moun tains. The district has been known for some years, and the Mount Ver nou company in particular expended considerable money there ; but the ore, though abundant, seemed to be of low grade, and the mines declined in the estimation of the population. The company alluded to stopped"], [112, "100 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES work early in 1808. During the summer, however, discoveries have been made which promise a bright future. The ledges formerly known lie in granite, characterized by unusually large and regular crystals of felspar, sometimes several inches in length, generally twins, but occa sionally single. The old claims in this district are fine specimens of fissure-veins, regular, well-defined, and dipping steeply. They are from two or three inches to as many feet in width, and contain a good deal of antimony, in silver ores of medium grade. The new discoveries are several miles west of the old Mammoth silver-belt, in limestone, which in some places passes over to a kind of greenstone. These claims are remarkable for containing gold, as well as silver. The Marble Falls, owned by Hatch & Company, located April 25, 1808, is a very large lode (10 feet wide) and shows native gold throughout nearly its whole extent. The gold is light-colored, evidently being alloyed with silver, in what proportions is not yet made public. The owners are shipping the ore in sacks to San Francisco. Union district. \u2014 This district is situated in the Shoshone range of mountains, about 50 miles south of Austin. The Shoshone mountains are parallel with the Toiyabe, and form the western boundary of Eeese Eiver valley. Union district was organized in 1803, and the town of lone, then commenced, was for some time a flourishing settlement. In the geological formation porphyritic rocks predominate, and occur in great variety of form, color, and texture. In many places the porphyry appears to be stratified, and this, with other indications, leads to the inference that it is not a true eruptive or igneous porphyry, but rather a metamorphosed sandstone. A kind of gabbro also occurs, enclosed with porphyry. The veins are in the porphyry, which in their immediate neighborhood assumes a closer texture and shows few or no crystals. They vary from a few inches to two or three feet in width, and are in some places considerably broken. The minerals occurring in the veins are native gold aud silver, horn-silver, (chloride) antimonial sulphurets of silver, copper and lead, with carbonate and silicate of copper and carbonate of lead. Galena, very rich in silver, is also frequent. Among the principal mines are the Mountain Brow, Yolo, Pleiades, Stonewall, Franklin, Revenue, Andrew Jackson, Hobart, and others. In the Moun tain Brow an exceedingly rich galena has been found, while handsome gold specimens have been taken from the Franklin. About 12 miles south of the town of lone is the mining camp of Grantville, now nearly deserted. Here are several large ledges which have been considerably prospected. The Great Eastern is situated on a hill north of the camp, and consists of several parallel locations on what appears to be one large outcrop. The ore is porous, and contains some gold with its silver. The ledge is much broken, and the explorations on it have not, on the whole, resulted favorably. Union district has an abundance of fuel and water. The Pioneer mill at lone has ten stamps and four roasting furnaces. It formerly worked the ores of the neighborhood, but is now closed. A few miles south of lone is the Knickerbocker mill, of twenty* stamps owned by a New York company. It was employed in working the ore of the Great Eastern, but has recently been run as a custom mill. In the spring and early summer its yield of bullion was quite regular and the owners of some ten mines were kept at work to supply it. It is' said that the Indianapolis, a mine belonging to the company which owns the mill, contained no water at the depth of 240 feet \u2014 a phenomenon remark able in mining generally, but not very uncommon in eastern Nevada. It is observable in San Antonio, Trinity, and other districts. lone like"], [113, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 101 Whlt^plne^\u212211 SUff6r fl\u00b0m the excitement 110w drawing thousands to Twin Eiver district, (see report of J.

The vein is cut off, as the sketch shows, in the 10-fathom level at 320 feet north of the incline ; iu the 20-fathom at 340 feet, by a slide, coursing north 75 east, and dipping about 00 north. The indications are that Ihe continuation of the vein will be found to the west, but this should be doue once for all on the 30-fathom level, as a re-discovery in the 10-fathom would not open any great amount of ground. Two hundred feet and more of drifting and cross-cutting have been done on this upper level, in the dead rock, to satisfy the anxious desire of the stockholders to find the vein again as soon as possible. As the sketch shows, the immediate reserves of the mine tire small, (4 and 5 of the sketch,) but the comple tion of the 30 and 40 fathom levels to the Macdonald line on one side, and to the line of the slide on the other, would give an amount of pro ductive ground larger than that already worked out. A great difficulty in this mine has been the extraordinary density and hardness of the rock. Eighteen thousand drills are sharpened monthly for less than 40 men. In sinking the incline, three shifts of three men each, or nine men daily in all, have sometimes not made ten feet in depth in a month. It is, therefore, impossible for the mine to be worked to the best advantage, and to supply the large 20-stamp mill of the company, (see J. Boss Browne's report, 1808, page 410,) uuless a considerable amount of ground is first opened in advance. True economy requires that the levels should"], [114, "102 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES be 120 instead of 60 feet apart, and that a new level should be com pletely open before the one above it is exhausted of its ore ground. The mining work of the Twin Eiver has been thoroughly well done, and the mine is in good condition, and one of the most valuable wliich I have seen during the year. It is proposed to stop the mill and open mining ground for six mouths. Giant powder and the diamond drill will be tried, and Stetefeldt's roasting furnace, which has been tried here and found successful, will replace the rever beratories in future. I think the rock of the Twin Eiver mine would give good results with the giant pow der, but experiments only can decide. Since the above notes were collected, during a personal examination, the company has gone into bankruptcy, with property amounting to $300,000 outside of its mine, and a debt of some $60,000 covered by the cost of winter supplies on hand. This remarkable proceeding is said to be owing to the discouragement ofthe stockholders, who have received no dividends, although its mine has produced more than three-quarters of a million of dollars. My opinion of the mine, expressed above, remains unaltered; nor do I perceive any ground for such a feeling as is said to exist among the stockholders. If the property is sacrificed, it will perhaps fall into the hands of a set of proprietors who understand its nature and value.* The Twiii Eiver mill reduced in 1867 and 1868 ore as follows : Quarter ending March 31, 1807, 1,161\u00a3 tons, yielding per ton * $84 18 coin. Quarter ending June 30, 1808, S05| tons, yielding per ton 92 94 coin. Quarter ending September 30, 1807, 800 tons, yielding per ton 179 24 coin.

The usual rate assumed is 75 cents gold per $1 currency; but I do not know positively that all the assessors invariably adhere to it. I obtained the last item in the above table from the assessor of Nye county, before the calculation of currency value had been made. The following table of production is compiled and calculated from the books of the company, and has reference only to coin: *The above account of the present condition ofthe Twin River mine must be understood as an add. hon to the account in Mr. Browne's report.

The average of pay-rock last year was about 2 feet, out of an average of 0 feet vein-thickness. The ore was sorted one in three ; and lor every ton worked, two were mined and not worked. The dumps of low grade ore at the mine are very large. The average cost of run ning the mine is $10,000 per month, and the mill $15,000. When the mill runs virtually at half capacity, as for several months in the above table, it loses money. San Antonio district\u2014 This district lies across the southern portion of Smoky valley. The settlement is called Indian Springs, and its position relative to other well-known points will be seen from the following: TABLE OF DISTANCES. Direction. E.

The San Antonio district is a very large one; it stretches from the southern line of the Marysville district nearly one hundred and fifty miles southward, and extends from a point fifty miles east of Indian Springs to a point a hundred miles west of that place, covering, there fore, an area of almost 150 miles square. Of course, surveys have never been thought of; and, in point of fact, I have no doubt that this vast and vague district, if its limits were ouce determined, would be found to overlap a good many others of later date. Whatever its real boundaries may be, it is certain that it contains the short range called San Antonio mountain, about eight miles southeast of Indian Springs. The district was regularly organized November 1, 1803. There is a provision iu the mining laws of San Antonio district, according to which any claim opened to a certain extent (expressed in the number of feet of drifting or shaft ing \u2014 and I think the number is fifteen !) remains forever the property ofthe claimant, and can never be relocated on account of subsequent abandon ment. This provision is highly absurd and detrimental to the general interests of the district, which is full of claims, abandoned (for a time, at least) by their locators, who were without capital to work them, and yet completely shut out from development by other hands. The Toiyabe range of mountains, separating Eeese Eiver and Smoky valleys, consists of slate, quartzite, granite, porphyry, greenstone, and trachyte, the mere enumeration of which is sufficient to prove that the formation is the pro duct of different ages, and the structure by no means regular. The San Antonio mountain, which may be regarded as a southern extension of the first range east of the Toiyabe, seems to contain no granite, but to consist mainly of slate, quartzite, porphyry, greenstone and volcanic rock. Obsidian, which is an unmistakable volcanic product, is found on the mountain. Judging* from the character of ihe debris on the southern and western sides, where the Liberty and other mines are situated, I"], [116, "104 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES should think the predominant rock of that flank to be porphyry. The evidences of disturbance are quite sufficient to account for the numerous fissure-veins found in this locality.

At the end of this cross cut, not shown on the sketch, is a winze about 20 feet deep. The vein is 30 feet wide in the cross cut, and filled at that pcint with low-grade quartz. I, surface working ; 2, 2, ground partially worked out on a supposed course of very rich ore ; 2' 2', portions of the said course uot yet worked ; 3, 3, ground worked on a second course of rich ore, southeast of the incline ; 3' 3', supposed continuations of the said course ; 4 4, ground containing, so far as explored, second aud third class ore, with $40 to $75 per ton. The Liberty vein lies in the foothills on the southwest side of San Antonio mountain, about twelve miles from Indian Springs. Its general course is northwest and southeast, and the dip, as measured in the incline, is 43\u00b0 northeast for the first hundred feet in depth, and 50\u00b0 northeast below that point. At the lowest workings the vein stands yet steeper, according to the measurement of Mr. Eigby7. The outcrop may be traced on the surface, with an insignificant \"heave\" of about 20 feet, occurring some 50 feet southeast of the incline, for a distance of 700 or 800 feet. The company's claim includes the whole of the visible out crop. Northwest of the incline the vein sweeps towards the west, describing a curve of some 45\u00b0. The fissure varies from four feet in width upwards. Two or three hundred feet northwest from the main incline, at the end of the curve alluded to, it is 80 feet wide, as shown by a cross cut, connecting a shaft and incline on opposite sides of the vein, at the depth of some 70 feet. Excluding- this extraordinary aud local development from the calculation, I should put the average width of the"], [117, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 105 vein at 8 to 10 feet. The country rock on both walls is porphyry. The walls are tolerably well defined, the hanging-wall being on the whole the most regular and distinct. It is my impression that the change of course above alluded to, being accompanied with a widening of the vein, and a decrease of dip to 30\u00b0 north, is largely a superficial matter, and that in depth both the course, dip aud width of the fissure will be more nearly uniform. This notion may be illustrated by taking a pamphlet and holding it with the back downwards, inclined so as to represent the average dip of the vein. The edges of the leaves, opposite the back, will represent the outcrop of the vein. If now the pamphlet be bent with thumb and finger at one of the upper corners, three results will follow. The dip of the whole upper edge will be decreased, especially near the corner bent; the course ofthe edge will be deflected at that comer; and the leaves will spread under the thumb and finger, thus widening the outcrop. Precisely these phenomena are observable in the Liberty mine, and this is my reason for the theory above advanced. The vein-matter of the Liberty is mainly clay, porphyry and quartz \u2014 the latter being* accom panied with ores of silver. The rich ores are distributed in pockets and chimneys, but a good deal of the vein around and between these pockets is ore of the second and third class. The lowest quartz found is a little damp; but there never has been a drop of water struck, thus far in the mine. Probably the next 100 feet in depth will bring water. With this will come sulphuretted ores, without doubt, and the vein may be expected to show its permanent structure and character. Hitherto all the ore extracted has been chloride (and other haloids) of silver, native silver, aud oxidized metals, together with disintegrated sulphurets. The Eigby mill (four stamps) is at Indian Springs. The stamps weigh about 700 pounds each, and are run at 85 to 100 drops per minute. A reverberatory and two Varney pans complete the apparatus of reduction. The stamps and pans are run by means of a small upright engine of about 15-horse power, receiving steam from a 30-flue tubular boiler. The maximum capacity of the battery and pans is probably greater than that of the furnace; but, as it does not equal that of two furnaces, there is no economical way of increasing the yield of the mill beyond the two tons daily which can be roasted by the present apparatus. The actual opera tions of the last year show \"that oue and three-quarters to two tons of ore have been the average quantity treated daily, when the mill was running\u2014 that is, from April 1, 1807, to July 10, and from the middle of October of the same year (with a loss of more than a month for repairs, last spring,) to the present time\u2014 or rather the lst of September\u2014 about a twelve-month in all. The amount of ore reduced, and its yield, may be found in the following statement. The tailings are not subjected to further treatment. No doubt, in working on a larger scale, they could be saved and profitably treated. Statement of bullion produced by the Rigby mill up tu August 1, 1868. ACTUAL RUNNING TIME ABOUT ONE YEAR. i ! : !

The attempt of the company to carry on this enterprise by skimming the richest ore out of their splendid mine lasted about one year, and has been wisely abandoned. The mill has been stopped, and the mine is now being thoroughly opened, so that when reduction of ore is resumed, it may be upon a scale large and certain enough to allow expenses per ton to be decreased, aud ore of average richness ($60) to be worked with profit. In this way a large and prosperous business will doubtless be established on the only sound mining basis \u2014 reduction of ore in g^eat quantities at low rates.

Reveille district is in Nye county, about 130 miles south-southeast of Austin. Iu order to reach it from the latter place five ranges of moun tains must be crossed, viz: the Toiyabe, Smoky Valley, (or Mootay,) Monitor, Hot creek, and Eeveille ranges. From Hot creek to Eeveille is about 40 miles. The journey from Austin requires three days for a horseman and six for a loaded wagon. The geological character of the district is that of a steep dolomitic range, forming the western side of the Eeveille mountains. The surrounding porphyritic mountains, and many of the sloping foot-hills, are wooded. In the valley is an extensive salt marsh. The supply of water is poor, there being no running streams. Water is obtained, however, by wells in the porphyry. Six miles from the mines it is abundant. The dolomite range above mentioned is not continuous, but is divided into a northern and a southern portion by a wedge-like body of porphyry, and this rock also constitutes the mass of the mountain range on the eastern side, which doubtless caused the upheaval of the dolomite. The processes and products of metamorphosis can be here studied to great advantage. The porphyry in the neighbor hood ofthe dolomite loses its solidity; the crystals of felspar are altered to kaoline ; the color of the rock changes or disappears ; efflorescenses of alum occur ; in short, there are many evidences that the alteration of"], [120, "108 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES the rock was begun by solfataras, or springs of sulphurous acid gas. The metamorphosis has, however, gone still further. After the solfataras had transformed to sulphates the iron, alkalies, and the greater part of the alumina in the porphyry, and these had been washed away, mineral springs began the work of silicifying and otherwise solidifying the decomposed mass. In this way it comes to pass that the porphyry appa rently passes over into dense, colorless rock, iu which the original struc ture is no longer visible. Even the quartz granules have become indis tinguishable in the mass, and one observes only here and there pseudo morphs of felspar. Even this feature vanishes at last, and fine grained sandstones are formed, now colorless as white marble, now striped with red and yellow ; and these finally pass into hard quartzite. All these stages of metamorphosis may frequently be observed within a limited space. A fine opportunity to study them is afforded by a caikm in Atlantic mountain, in this district. It should be added that the por phyry had not merely lifted the dolomite, but also broken through between its layers, and separated some portions of it from the rest. The forego ing description will apply with general accuracy as an explanation ofthe apparently chaotic variety and confusion of the so-called porphyries, quartzites, greenstones, granites, limestones, &c, of the Nevada moun tains. The full understanding of these phenomena is to be sought by careful and detailed stratigraphical studies with the key afforded by the known results of solfataric action, and that of thermal and mineral springs. I am indebted for much information on this point to Mr. Stet efeldt, whose ideas have been almost invariably confirmed by my per sonal observations. The full report on Eeveille district from his pen is one of the ablest papers on the geology of Nevada whicii I have ever seen. The dolomite of this district is the country rock of the ore deposits. It is granular, white, or gray, devoid of stratification, and, as far as is yet known, of fossils. It contains a little quartz in fine particles and, in some places, carbonate of iron. The silver ores occur in it neither as veins nor as beds, but as irregular masses quite distinctly separated from the country rock. These masses crop out even above the dolomite, sometimes standing like walls on the side of the mountain. They vary in size from a few inches to many feet. The gangue is exclusively quartz, containing silver copper glance, aud silver glance, altered on the surface to native silver, horn silver, and carbonates of copper. Antimony glance is rare. Sulphurets of iron, copper, zinc, and lead, have not been found. A more favorable ore for amalgamation could scarcely be sought. The contents in silver, especially in the masses which do not crop out very widely, are extremely large. Pulp assays run from $200 to $1,047 per ton; and quartz assays of selected samples might attain almost any figures, up to the chemical limits. The masses referred to were errone ously held to be the outcrops of veins, and much disappointment has resulted from failure iu some cases to find their continuance in depth. Among the mines, or rather claims, may be named the Fisherman, Cres cent, August, Adriatic, Garden City, Highbridge, Aurora, Bolivia, Ottawa, Mediterranean, Baltic, and Indian Queen mines. Considerable ore has been hauled to the Old Dominion mill at Hot creek, 40 miles distant. To pay expenses of mining and transportation, the ore must be worth more than $100 per ton. The Rutland mill (five stamps) was refitted in April last, and set to work in May. I have no recent reports from it ; but 1 am under the impression that the district has been partially abandoned, the idea having obtained currency among the miners that deposits in lime stone are not permanent. This is in a certain sense true of this and"], [121, "109 WEST OF THE -ROCKY MOUNTAINS. similar districts ; but the real difficulty is one of ownership and manage ment. I believe that claims on \"lodes\" where there are no lodes cannot be profitably worked ; and Eeveille, like Cortez district, has suffered from the attempt to apply to it a system of vein mining whicii could not be carried out. The same danger threatens White Pine, which in many respects resembles both thedistriets named. Companies owning a suffi cient area in square locations, to include many of these ore masses, might yet achieve in Eeveille a brilliant success. Hot Creek district lies 90 or 100 miles southeast of Austin, and about 40 miles by air-line almost due east of Belmont. The district lies in a colossal mass of porphyry, 20 miles wide and 50 miles long, which includes in several places large bodies of limestone, or rather dolomite, forming precipitous aud irregular cappings along the highest points of the m< \u25a0untain range. It is not easy, under such circumstances, in advance of more thorough geological surveys, to say whether the porphyry has upheaved these sedimentary masses, or is itself a metamorphosed sedimen tary rock in place beneath them. The porphyritic ranges of Nevada fre quently exhibit these limestone caps ; and the latter are accompanied with belts of quartzite, or \"quartz veins,\" often of incredible extent. The ex planations given in the account of Eeveille district may apply here. The great quartzite belt of this district (similar to the Nevada Giant in Cor tez) is in some places three-quarters of a mile wide, and may be followed for 10 miles, while its continuations in other dolomitic islands appear throughout the whole length of theporphyriticrange. The quartz of this belt is often white as snow. It never shows any ore ; but ore is found in the neighborhood of its course, in the dolomite. The manner of occurrence can scarcely be classified among the usual general terms as vein, bed, mass, pocket, or impregnation. It might be called a segregation, since that may mean anything. There are some features of almost every class presented. Most frequently the ore deposit consists of a vein-like zoue ofthe limestone, highly silicified, (cherty,) which contains in spots a lit tle horn silver, and at greater depth silver copper glance, but very irregu larly aud sparingly. The Indian Jim and Old Dominion are examples. Other deposits are more massive, but retain the form of veins. Those most resembling veins have, however, neither selvages nor slickensides. The Keystone is an example. On the other hand some small bunches, like the Pennsylvania, show very distinct slickensides. The canon of II ot Creek is very precipitous. The hot springs appear to break out from the border between limestone and porphyry. In the bed of the stream there are steam springs, which for a distance of 2,000 feet keep the water boil ing. It is remarkable that the finest springs of cold water occur close by the hot ones. The Hot Creek company (or Old Dominion) had a 10 stamp mill here, which was supplied from these springs with hot and cold water. This company owned the Norfolk, Merrimac, Old Dominion, and other claims. After a brief success with the surface ore of the latter vein the mill failed, was partly burnt down, rebuilt, and set at work upon ore from Morey district. Afterwards it stopped again ; and I am told it has been removed to White Pine. Three or four settlers still maintain the town of Hot Creek with the perseverance of despair \u2014 unless they, too, since my last advics, have gone to White Pine. Philadelphia district. \u2014 This district, known also as Silver Bend, is described in Mr. Browne's last report, page 420. I visited Belmont, its mining town, (and the county-seat of Nye county,) in August, and found mining operations rather depressed. The Combination Company's splen did 40-stamp mill was about to be shut down for want of ore. This was done in a day or two after ; and the company is now proceeding to open"], [122, "110 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES the mining ground in depth whicii will enable them to run the mill. But the latter is too large. Buel's Belmont Silver Mining Company was extracting good ore on a small scale, and the vein (the celebrated Tran sylvania) had been worked by open cuts aud other expedients almost as far as practicable, without machinery, from the surface downward. The Buel mill, 10 stamps, was idle, or only running* now and then on tailings, or custom-ore. I hear it has since been started up with success. The Buel and the Combination are both properties that will probably be found very valuable when once thoroughly opened. The only mine I saw on the Transylvania* which contains any considerable portion of ore in sight ready for stoping down is the Silver Bend Company's, a sketch of whicii is here given, as showing the general features of that famous deposit.

Reserves 1 and 3 3 1 estimate to contain about J, 500 tons of $100 ore, consisting of stetefeldtite and sulphurets, chloridized at and near the surface. The average width of the Transylvania ledge in the Buel and Com bination mines seems to be 6 or 8 feet. Combination mill.\u2014 The following notes upon this mill will be interest ing to mill-men. There are 40 stamps, weight 720 pounds ; drop, 80 per minute; 24 smooth-bottom pans for amalgamation, and 12 settlers. A Corlie's engine (125 horse power) runs the pans, and a Todd & Eafferty (75-horse power) the stamps. This arrangement is unfortunate, since the mill cannot be run at all without keeping both engines iu motion ; run ning at half capacity on custom work is therefore not profitable. There are 10 reverberatories for roasting ore. At the time of my visit 20 stamps were crushing wet, for direct amalgamation, (Washoe process ) and 20 dry, for roasting, (Eeese Eiver process.) Ore yielding $25 to $30 was being worked by wet crushing ; and 700 to 800 pounds of concen trated tailings were obtained from the 20 stamps daily, assaying $200 * I regard the Transylvania and Highbridge as one and the same vein."], [123, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 111 per ton. These were roasted. There appears to be little loss in \" slimes,\" as the ore is soft, and the sulphurets do not get too finely ground. Assays !n the reservoir sll0w> at the end of sluice, $21 99 per ton ; 15 feet further, $15 71 ; 15 feet still further, $12 56. Thc tailings from roasted ores assay at the end of the sluice $20 41, indicating a yield by the process of about 80 per cent, of the silver in the ore. The mill guaranteed 80 per cent., but could do better on uniform ores than on the small lots of custom-work it was obliged to accept. Ore worth more than $80 per ton is roasted. The cost of the wet process is estimated at $7 50 per ton only ; but this figure is, iu my opinion, too low. It can only be maintained, at any rate, by steadily running the mill at full capacity, when the cheapness of fuel ($5 per cord) will give a certain advantage over the mills of the Comstock mines, which employ the same process, at a cost of $10 to $12 per ton. The Combination mill produced bullion as follows: Eldorado. \u2014 The Transylvania lode, as I have said, turns south, at the south incline on the Silver Bend location. How far it continues in that direction is not known; but further south, and separated from this point by two ridges, crops out the Eldorado vein, running north and south with the slate-country rock. The vein carries a body of quartz, nearly barren, 4 feet in thickness, to the depth thus far explored, (120 feet on the incline,) and in the hanging wall a magnificent mass of rich chloride ore, of unknown extent. The ore gives (first-class) $200, $300, aud even $500 per ton. It contains much visible horn-silver. The owners ofthe Eldorado south were simply \"gouging the outcrop\" at the time of my visit. Manhattan district. \u2014 This district lies in the Mootay or Smoky range, (the eastern boundary of Smoky valley,) about 15 miles south of Belmont. It was not mentioned in Mr. Browne's report; and not much can be said about it now. The principal rocks are granite, argillaceous and calca reous slates, and some limestone. The ores are the usual antimonial sul phurets, peculiar to eastern Nevada, with their decompositions, such as chloride of silver, &c. The Ophir mine has been opened to a depth of about 50 feet, and shows some very rich ore. A test working of 2,500 pounds, made at one of the Austin mills last summer, is reported to have yielded by pulp assay* $230 per ton. This district is abundantly supplied with nut-pine, suitable for fuel and mining timbers, and contains several springs. * The pulp assay is the assay made upon a carefully taken average sample of the crushed ore from tho batteries. It is generally higher than the actual mill-product by a small amount. For the quarter ending \u2014 Ore. Process.

CHAPTER IX. LINCOLN COUNTY. Pahranagat district. \u2014 In addition to the description of this district con tained in Mr. Browne's last report (Mineral Resources, &c, 1808, p. 426,) the following statements are offered, based upon a more recent and careful examination. The Pahranagat mines are situated in a chain of mouutains, mainly composed of limestone and porphyry, which forms the western slope of the head of Pahranagat valley. The highest ridge of this chain, Mt. Irish, is the centre of the mineral belt of Pahranagat district. This belt extends north and south about five miles, and has a width of from half a mile to two miles. Almost everywhere the mountains are well covered, as compared with other ranges of their class, with nut-pine and cedar; and on the western slope of Mt. Irish, near the summit, there is abund ance of pine timber, many of the trees measuring two feet, and a few over three feet in diameter. This timber is, however, not of superior quality, being very brittle on account of the extreme dryness of the soil. There is plenty of water in Pahranagat valley, 12 miles from the princi pal mines, but it is very scarce near the mines themselves. The principal mining camp, Silver City, is compelled to haul its supply from a spring two or three miles distant. Por this reason mills must either be built in Pahranagat valley, involving a heavy expense for transportation of ores, or they must rely upou the mines for their supply of water. The latter source is extremely unreliable, as the water-line in the mines seems to lie very deep. The great distance of Pahranagat from commercial centres (the route to Austiu is nearly 200 miles, and all other lines of communi cation are much longer) considerabty enhances the cost of materials aud supplies.

The base of Mt. Irish, and the ridges which emanate from it, are composed of gray crystalline limestone, here almost entirely without fossils and stratification. Further north, and outside of the metalliferous belt, the limestone abounds in fossils, and is distinctly stratified. Above the limestone lies an immense stratum of quartzite, 300 to 400 feet in thickness, which forms the precipitous eastern slope of Mt. Irish, and is again overlaid with limestone. There is also a huge quartzite dike which cuts, with a westerly dip, nearly north and south through the ridges and canons ofthe eastern slope of Mt. Irish, forming a barrier beyond whicii the mineral veins do not extend, and no mineral deposits have been found. A similar dike runs northeast and southwest with northwestern dip through the limestone, near its southern terminus in Crescent canon. The upheaval of the limestone formation has been effected by eruptions of quartz porphyry, which forms the foot-hills of the eastern branches of Mt. Irish, and rises in bold mountains south of Logan and Crescent. It is again found west of Mt. Irish, and almost surrounds the whole limestone formation. In Crescent canon the decom posed debris of this rock form a tolerable clay for bricks, the best mate rial for this purpose in the district, from which were manufactured the bricks for the new furnaces of the mill in Hiko. Near Logan the por phyry is much decomposed, as shown by white zones running through the rock. The debris of this decomposed porphyry have formed a white conglomerate, which is a good building stone. As I have remarked, these features are common to many districts of Nevada, though it is usual with prospectors to pronounce every new district discovered a lustis natur\u00e6, \"baffling the knowledge of the geologist and setting all preconceived notions of science at fault.'' (This sort of talk is now cur rent about White Piue, a district the geological formation of which is singularly clear and simple.) The principal source of difficulty in the study of such formations is the extent and variety of the metamorphosis ofthe porphyry. In many places it is evident that the quartzite which is found in connection with the crystalline limestone aud porphyry is but a highly altered form of the latter. (For a discussion of this point see description of Reveille district.) The gangue accompanying the Pahranagat ores is an extremely hard and solid quartz, either white or stained with iron ; calcspar appears subordiuately. The silver-bearing minerals are galena and stetefeldtite. The latter is the principal silver ore in all the mining districts of southeastern Nevada.* It contains from 2 to 13 per cent, of silver, according to locality, in combination with sul phur ; also oxides of iron, lead, and copper, combined with antimonic acid and water. Near the surface these minerals are, of course, more or less decomposed. In most mining districts of Nevada, where limestone forms the coun try rock, no mineral veins are found, but only deposits of very irregular shape; but the mineral belt of Pahranagat is traversed by innumerable fissures, running in all directions. Some of these appear to form per manent veins; some are only superficial ; while others enclose wedge shaped deposits of ore, the walls of which meet at various angles; and still others are only slides and breaks in the mountains. The limestone overlying the quartzite is, so far as known, barren of metalliferous ores. *This mineral (probably the same as thc partzite of Esmeralda) was established as a species two or three years ago by Mr. C. A. Stetefeldt, of Austin, whose name it beats. The remarks of Adelberg aud Raymond, quoted on page 426 of Mr. Browne's report, were made previous to this identification of the species. From assays (uot analysis) and general appear ances we supposed it to be polybasite, and alluded to it as such. H. Ex. Doc. 54 8"], [126, "114 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES There are some mineral-bearing fissures in the quartzite itself, near the summit of Mt, Irish, but the principal mineral belt is the limestone under- lying it, The walls of these fissures are sometimes, where they have been filled with quartz, extremely smooth and highly polished. The mineral deposits of Pahranagat may be classified as follows : 1. A system of veins running nearly northeast and southwest; exam- ples, List, Ulrich Dahlgren, Illinois. 2. A system running east and west, with more or less variation to the south and north ; examples, Juniper, Springer, Utah, and Nevada. 3. Veins running northeast and southwest in the quartzite ; examples, Green Monster, Penobscot. 4. Superficial veins ; examples \u2014 it is probable that most of the east and west veins belong to this class. 5. Deposits ; examples, Diana, lower workings of Indiana. The northeast and southwest veins must be considered as the main lodes of the district. They have a steep dip of about 75\u00b0 southeast, and are distinguished by their huge croppings, often more than 20 feet in width. The quartz has a dull color, resembles quartzite, and is mostly barren ; but in places chimneys of rich ore have been found. In the List and Illinois, the two most developed mines, it was found that these bodies of pay-ore only extended some 40 feet below the croppings, and thus far, down to 180 feet, no more material has been found which will pay either mining or milling expenses. The east and west veins have mostly a northern dip, from 35\u00b0 to 75\u00b0. Their croppings are not soprominentas those of thefirst class. The quartz is mostly porous, and colored with oxide of iron. There is sometimes good ore in sight at the surface. The width of these veins varies from two inches to two feet. The narrower ones are mainly found near the north- east and southwest main ledges, and can only be considered as spurs. Although some of them, like the Nora, carry extraordinarily rich ore, they cannot be worked with profit on account of their small size. Only one of the east aud west veins, the Springer, has been developed to any con- siderable depth. The Springer incline is 115 feet deep, and the vein at the bottom is about one foot wide, white quartz, with cubes of coarse galena. The Juniper, one of the larger veins of this group, can be traced for a long distance, and has been worked at tbe surface, yielding an ore containing galena, and a very plumbiferous variety of stetefeldtite, and averaging $80 to $90 silver per ton. The veins in quartzite are narrow, and resemble the foregoing. Several tous of ore have been extracted from the Green Monster, and are said to have yielded $150 silver per ton; but there is hardly any ore now in sight. It is not known whether these veins in quartzite descend into the underlying limestone. In several places irregular masses of ore, sometimes of very high grade, have been segregated in the limestone, generally at the intersection of two or three fissures, not belonging to the main systems. Such is the case with the Diana, which has been entirely dug out, and vainly sought for at greater depth by means of a long tunnel. Many other locations in the district, which have no signs of true veins, are doubtless similar to this. The developments in this district are both costly and extensive, but have been conducted with such conspicuous absence of skill and com mon sense, that they may be said to have produced hardly any results whatever. On the one hand, no mine has yet been made productive ; and ou the other hand, scarcely any have been so thoroughly explored as to render their unproductiveness a matter of certainty. But few"], [127, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 115 companies are now at work ; and it is to be hoped that these will perse vere until the actual value of the district is ascertained. The sums expeuded in Pahranagat are estimated as follows : Companies or mines. Amount.

CHAPTER X. ESIvIERALDA COUNTY. Columbus district Vies in Esmeralda county, about GO miles east-south- east of Aurora, 140 miles southwest of Austin, and 35 miles northwest of Silver Peak. It was discovered in 1804. The town of Columbus is situated ou the western edge of an alkaline flat, designated on some of the maps as \" Great Soda Lagoon.\" Two miles north of the town and on the edge of the same flat is a salt marsh of considerable extent. The hills of which the district is composed are spurs or offshoots of the White Mountain range, and generally almost barren of wood. The rocks of the district are granite, metamorphic slates and sandstones, and trachyte. The veins may be divided into two classes, the one lying generally in the granite, and the other in the metamorphic rocks. The first class is highly cupriferous, and carries horn-silver, stetefeldtite and other kindred silver minerals, combined with malachite, azurite and other common products from the decomposition of copper-bearing minerals. These veins are generally from one to two or three feet in width, and their ore is of high grade. The Balnarte is a good example of the first class. The second class occurs generally in slate, more or less metamorphosed, and the ore contains much carbonate, antimoniate, and other salts, of lead. The veins are broader than those of the first class, aud the ore is more uni- form, but of lower grade. The Potosi group, Northern Belle and Ural, are good examples. The Northern Belle is more than 15 feet wide, and crops out distinctly for several hundred feet. About 25 tons of the ore are said to have been worked at the Knickerbocker mill, at Jones's, 90 miles distant, and to have yielded by pulp assay $123 per ton. Until recently, Columbus district has been without reduction works of any kind, but duriug the past year A. J. Holmes aud others have put up a small mill (four stamps, I believe,) which will soon commence, if it has * One Id-stamp mill. 1 One 5 aud oue 10-stamp mill."], [128, "116 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES not by this time already commenced, to work the ores of the neighbor hood. Water is found by sinking a few feet in the alkaline flat above mentioned, and an abundance of wood is obtained from hills 10 or 12 miles distant. About 18 miles northwest of Columbus is the Virginia salt marsh, well known as one of the largest and best ever discovered in Nevada. For some time it supplied the mills of Virginia City ; but upon the discovery of salt marshes nearer to that town this one was abandoned. I think it is only occasionally worked, to fill special contracts. The salt is col lected by excavating in the loose soil of the marsh vats, in which water accumulates, and dissolves the salt from the surrounding earth. The subsequent evaporation of the water under the heat ofthe sun, the dry air aud almost constant wind, leaves a thick crust of pure and excellent crystalline salt, which is gathered with shovels and thrown into heaps to await wagon transportation to the mills. The Red Mountain gold mines, near Silver Peak, 90 miles southeast of Aurora and 140 miles south of Austin, are being successfully developed by a New York company. The improvements mentioned in the report of my predecessor (1808, page 339) have been completed ; the mines are connected with the mill by a skilfully constructed railway, lj mile in length, and a fine wagon road G\u00a3 miles in length, having so uniform a grade that a team of eight mules can haul 15 to 20 tons at a load down the mountain, making one trip in two-thirds of a day. The transportation of the ore does not exceed $2 per ton in cost, the mining $1 50 to $2 per ton, and the working in mill $4 to $5. These extraordinarily low rates arise from the natural advantages of the location as well as the skilful use that has been made of them. The principal gold-bearing veins of the company lie on the side of a high mountain, dipping with the slope of the surface, and they have been stripped of large portions of the hanging wall by natural denudation and deeply cross-cut by sev eral canons. In other words, nature has laid bare the veins to the depth of hundreds of feet below their highest outcrops, and mining is mere quarryiug. This fact, and the wise liberality of the company in provi ding \u2014 at a cost of more than $20,000 \u2014 cheap transportation for its ores, will enable it to work low-grade quartz, of which it possesses an immense quantity, together with much that will yield $50 and upwards per ton. The 20-stamp mill of the company at Silver Peak is now running; but I have no results as yet. The current year will probably witness a large production of bullion from this locality. Colonel Catherwood, of a New York company, is working some very promising mines in Palmetto district, 20 miles from Silver Peak. The mill under his charge is said to have started recently, but I have not received any returns. The ore from the mines is often very rich, indeed, containing stetefeldtite, native silver and chloride. Pine Grove district. \u2014 This district is situated in Esmeralda county, Nevada, tit the southwest end of the great basin which terminates north ward in the sink of Carson river. The district is in a range of hills east of the Washoe range, and about 30 miles in direct line, or 03 to 05 miles by wagon road, from Carson and Virginia Cities. These pine grove hills are in many places densely covered with nut pines or pinons, and con sist principally of syenite, which is traversed by gabbro. In the latter rock occur most of the auriferous quartz veins. The inhabitants believe that the numerous outcrops, which course generally north and south and vary in width from 20 feet downward, (the average is much less than 20 feet,) are all parts of a mammoth fissure vein 200 feet thick. It is quite likely, however, that these constitute only a vein system of gash- veins,"], [129, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 117 caused by the breaking through the granite of the gabbro. The vein matter is principally quartz, carrying, near the surface, free gold, oxides of iron, decomposed copper pyrites and galena. Near the surface the quartz is very porous and the ores are richer than they have hitherto been found in depth, where the quartz becomes more solid, and crys talline, and galena, copper ore, and iron pyrites predominate, while free gold begins to disappear. The deepest mining work, however, is only 80 feet underground, and the only indications as to the character of the veins at greater depth are afforded by wells, which have been dug 150 to 200 feet below the surface. At this point is the water level, and it is possible that below that level the ores will be principally of lead and copper, poor iu silver, while the gold will be found in the iron pyrites. Some of the pyrites already mined contain gold at the rate of $5' to $7 per ton. The principal mines are the Wilson or Himalaya, (1,000 feet,) the Midas, (1,000 feet,) the Central, (1,000 feet,) and the Wheeler, (1,200 feet.) These are all situated on the main vein of the district, having a general course north 00\u00b0 east aud a dip of 27\u00b0 to 43\u00b0 northwest. This vein has an average width of 17 feet aud carries ore from 4 to 7 feet in width. It has casings of greenstone, which on the hanging wall is in places not more than three inches thick, and beyond which is the syenitic granite of the country. Ore has been extracted from the surface downward. Some very rich pockets have been met with, and the four mines above named yield from 50 to 70 tons of ore daily, yielding in mill an average of about $25 per ton. The cost of mining and milling, including all expenses, is probably not more than $17 per ton. There are two mills in the district, which are kept constantly employed. They have ten stamps each, crush wet, amalgamate in the battery, and have no pans. The assessor of Esmeralda reports for the quarter ending August 1, 1808, (July?) 2,081 tons of assessable ore, valued at more than $18 per ton, and 135 tons of an inferior grade, yielding in the aggregate over $95,000. Further returns not received. CHAPTER XI. HUMBOLDT COUNTY. This county having been treated very briefly and unsatisfactorily in the report of the mining commissioner last year, I felt the more desirous of visiting it in person and collecting more definite and detailed infor mation concerning its resources. It was my good fortune to meet a number of the most respectable and substantial citizens, among them Judge E. F. Dunn, of Union ville, to whom I am indebted for much of the following description. The most important localities iu the county I visited myself. Humboldt county has an area of about 10,000 square miles, nearly in the form of a square. Like Lander and other counties, it is divided into independent, narrow, parallel valleys by ranges of mountains, which have a general north and south course, and an altitude varying from 3,000 to 8,000 feet. Star Peak, the highest point, is 10,000 feet high. The Humboldt river separates the southeast quarter of the county from the rest, running as it does across the eastern line to the centre, and then almost due south to Humboldt lake, on the southern boundary. Hum boldt lake is about 10 miles long by 12 wide, It has not the beauty of"], [130, "118 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES Pyramid or Bigler. The eastern part of the county is the most elevated. West of 110\u00b0 west of Greenwich, the country sinks gradually, until at about 118\u00b0 30' west it subsides into sandy plains and alkali flats, barren of vegetation, dry and parched in summer, half covered with water in winter. In the ceutre of the county sparkling mountain streams abound, and cedar, mountain mahogany, and pine are found. East and north of this, it is well adapted for grazing and some branches of agri- culture. Here, as elsewhere in Nevada, cattle are kept on range the whole year, without shelter, and are able to grow fat on the white sage aud bunch-grass. A large portion of the southern half of the county is sandy and alkaline valleys, one of which includes the dreaded Forty Mile desert, once the terror of emigrants, but now traversed by the railroad, and, so far as it was a barrier to the westward flowing stream of travel, quite annihilated. Humboldt has had a remarkably speculative and fluctuating history. It has been the scene of higher hopes and more bitter disappointments than almost any other region. In the early days of silver mining in the State, Humboldt shared in the furor of prospecting and exploring and investing; but the difficulty, mechanical, metallurgical, or merely eco- nomical, of treating the ores, the lack of ores in many veins in depth, the effect of hasty and ill-considered local regulations, and other agen- cies, brought about a revulsion akin to a panic. Populous towns were deserted, whole districts abandoned, and mines upon whicii large sums had been expended were forsaken as worthless. It is usually a long time before one of' our mining districts recovers from such a reaction. They are always, so to speak, prematurely settled. The enterprise of the miner precedes all others, and when he fails there is nothing left for the community to fall back upon, and it disappears as swiftly as it was gathered. Humboldt county might have waited long for the renewed attention of labor and capital, but for the fortunate fact that the Pacific railroad was located through its territory and very near some of its most metalliferous ranges. The immediate result was an influx of visi- tors from California, looking for good mines, or making contracts to purchase ore. The forests ofthe Sierra are now made available for fuel and lumber ; labor is decreasing in price ; and, in a word, Humboldt is \" looking up.\" The principal districts in the county will be described iu alphabetical order. Battle Mountain district. \u2014 With the exception of a central meridional portion, the general course of the Humboldt is from east to west. It cuts across the ends of the long, flat valleys to the south. These val- leys, divided by high ranges, are about 15 miles wide. Reese River val- ley is one of them, and opens out on the Humboldt at a point 380 miles by rail east of Sacramento, or 220 from Reno. The range ou the west side of Reese River valley at this point is the Battle Mountain range, and the very point of it at the northern end, where it begins to slope down to- wards the Humboldt, is the high peak of Battle Mountain, named from an early Indian fight. At the base of Battle Mountain runs the Pacific railroad, and here will doubtless be located the railway station with which the southern trade and freight for Austin and other points must connect, Austin is 85 miles south by the new wagon-road through Reese River valley. The probable point of junction with the Idaho travel is also in this neighborhood, so that the prospects of Battle Mountain for easy communications and even commercial importance are not to be despised.' The mines are situated in the cations around Battle Mountain, and have been located since the summer of 1800. The district was organized in the spring of 1807. The ledge upon which most work had been done"], [131, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 119 up to August last was the Little Giant, running north and south across the summit of Little Giant hill, and dipping 35\u00b0 west. The width of the vein is four to six feet ; the country rock quartzite ; the ore concentrated in one pay-streak about 20 inches wide. The ore on the surface, from the decomposition of compounds of lead or antimony, has acquired a yellow, ocherous appearance, and is soft and crumbling. The gangue is not distinguishable in this yellow mass. This is true of all the surface ore of the district, except that of the Caledonia mine, which looks like broken steel. At a little depth the ore of the Little Giant grows darker in color, some of it being black and soft, but on exposure to the air it hardens and changes to the color of mispickel. The workings are not deep. From the summit to the northern end of the location \u2014 that is, for half the claim \u2014 the ledge has been stripped wherever it did not already crop out on the surface, aud at intervals it has been opened with shallow shafts. The prospecting has, therefore, been pretty thorough, except in depth. The south half of the Little Giant is owned by Mr. John Atchison, and has not been worked to any extent. The black ore from the work- ings (just described) of Fox and Macbeth assayed as high as $500 to the ton ; and a lot of 22 tons, hauled to mill, is said to have yielded $209 per ton. Next on the north is the location of the Monitor company, GOO feet. This Avas the original location on the Little Giant, Fox and Mac- beth having, in reality, the first southern extension. Still further north is the Santa Clara, supposed to be still an extension, and beyond this, in the same direction across an intervening canon, is the St. Helena, which is claimed as another extension of the Little Giant on the evidence of similarity in the general appearance of its mineral. The Montrose, three- fourths mile north of this, is a ledge of which high expectations are enter- tained. It is cased in talcose slate, and begins handsomely at the top with six feet of ore \u2014 how rich or how permanent was not yet known in August. Above the Montrose lies the Idaho, and above the Idaho the Caledonia, a fine-looking, with heavy, not decomposed ores, assaying $90. Mr. Atchison has put up in Fox canon a ten-stamp mill which was moved over from Black Rock. There is plenty of water in the district for steam-mills, and wood is abundant within ten miles. The district is teu miles from the Humboldt and seven or eight from the railroad. Besides the silver-bearing veins already mentioned, this district is dis- tinguished, like some others in Humboldt county, for its veins of copper ore. These are in copper caiions, some eight miles from Fox canon, and are very numerous aud rich, though their true character is scarcely deter- mined. They vary iu thickness from a few inches to several feet. The rock is talcose slate, dipping west, and overlying the quartzite in which most of the silver veins are enclosed. My authority for this observation is Judge Dunn, a keen observer by nature as well as education. I do not, however, attach any significance, in a region where the geological form- ation is so broken and irregular, to the local superposition of strata. The occurrence of veins of baser metals, or the admixture of such metals in silver ores, has not been very welcome to the Nevada miners hitherto, since nothing but the most precious metals would bear the cost of mining, reduction, and transportation ; but the construction of the railroad puts an entirely new face on the matter, and mines that woidd not formerly pay ou silver alone have suddenly become profitable by virtue of their base metals. These, however, cannot be utilized except by smelting. In my observations on Trinity district, below, more will be said on this sub ject. Since my return to the east it is reported from this district that the Battle Mountain mill, owned by Macbeth, Atchison & Co., is a perfect"], [132, "120 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES success. If this be the case, we may naturally look for a very rapid development of the district, as the result of all the coucurring circum stances above described. Black Rock district.\u2014 This district, comprising a large portion of the northwestern quarter of Humboldt county, has beeu the scene of hopes as wild and disappointments as overwhelming as any recorded in the history of American mines. As early as 1S59 the notice of acute, but ignorant observers was attracted by a dark-colored rock, occurring in heavy masses in that region, about a hundred miles from Uuionville. It was a bituminous clay, aud the associated rocks were almost without exception volcanic, giving no encouragement for the discovery of pre cious metals. But the waxy texture of the clay, doubtless being com pared to that of the rich silver ore known as horn-silver, (chloride of silver,) was considered a \" good indication,\" and it was not long before the story found credence that a uew ore of silver had been discovered in the \" black wax\" of Humboldt county. Respectable assayers in the Pacific States, and, to my knowledge, also in New York, flatly contra dicted the popular delusion. But the Black Rock people had an assayer of their own \u2014 a man by the name of Isenbeck \u2014 who claimed that no one but himself could extract the silver from these peculiar ores. He worked by what he called the Freiberg process, aud made use of a peculiar flux. It seems strange that intelligent men could believe such trash. Of course Mr. Isenbeck's secret flux contained a compound of silver. Six or seven years passed away in experiments and explorations. The peo ple of the Pacific coast were the victims far more than eastern capital ists. They wanted to keep the good thing to themselves. At last, in 1807, Mr. Isenbeck announced that he was ready to work the rock on a large scale, aud 13 tons were hauled for him from different ledges to Dall's mill, in Washoe county. The result announced was $70 to $400 per ton. A renewed excitement was the consequence. A mill was built in the Black Rock country, to be managed by Isenbeck. Two others were put in active preparation. But Mr. Isenbeck could not afford to use his flux on a large scale ; and, before operations commenced, he disappeared from the public eye. The Black Rock miners, who had shown for more than six years a grim determination and perseverance worthy of respect, though they had been credulous as children of the stories of this charla tan, abandoned their mines in despair. Houses, mills, everything was left as it stood, and in the summer of 1808 there was uot a human being in the district. Even thieves would not go there to steal the abandoned property. An expedition sent to the region by Mr. Clarence King con firmed the opinion of all scientific men from the beginning, that \" Black Rock was a swindle.\" I have related this story at some length, partly because my predeces sor, unable to visit the district in person, was misled into expressing a favorable opinion of it, although by the time his report was in print the bubble had long been dissipated aud the scheme forsaken. It is an unfortunate accident that, after this great fraud had been branded by the public press aud public opinion, it should receive its last word of praise in a \" public document.\" The accident is due, as I have pointed out, to the lapse of many months between the writing and the printing of the paragraph referred to. A second and still more important reason for dwelling on this history at the present time is the light which it throws on the knowledge and temperament of our mining population. A geologist woidd have condemned the Black Rock mines in the beginning; every chemist and metallurgist did declare the ores to be worthless; yet, on the word of a single pretender, hundreds of thousands of dollars were"], [133, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 121 expended by men who believed that their black wax contained silver aud gold in such a form that no ordinary assay could extract them. It was not for lack of scientific men, but for lack of faith in science, that these victims floundered on to their fate. This shows the insufficiency of imported science in a community uneducated to value it aright. It is true, as some western journal hits remarked, that Ave can bring over from Europe scientific men enough; but what we need is a mining science at home, which will raise the tone of the whole community. But this theme will find separate consideration in the sequel. I would remark, in closing this description of Black Rock, that miners in general cannot follow a safer course than to condemn instantly as a swindle any process which is declared to extract more gold and silver from any or every ore than can be extracted by an experienced assayer. We can, by quantitative chemical analysis, account for every atom of the weight of the substance analyzed ; we can check and prove our assays by various means, which approximate our certainty to the absolute ; we have studied for years the nature and the combinations of the elemental substances ; and now it may indeed be possible that gold and silver exist in forms and conditions hitherto unsuspected \u2014 imponderable, insoluble, infusible, intangible \u2014 but it is not likely ; and the man who asserts it may claim the ear of the chemist, but he has no right to ask attention of the capitalist. The chances of the truth of such an alleged discovery are iu iuverse propor tion to the number of men who have been busy with the subject, with all the light of modern science, without making the discovery \u2014 say as one to a thousand. Now, one to a thousand is a probability* quite suffi cient to deserve the respect of scientific inquirers ; it is, in fact, as great au authority as most new doctrines can claim ; but men investing money in matters of which they personally know nothing should look for better securityr. I have alluded to this whole region as the Black Rock district. Strictly speaking it comprised several districts, viz: Hardin, Black Rock, Pinte, Fireman, Chico, and High Rock, of which Hardin was the most import ant, and contained the Black Rock Co.'s mill, (four stamps,) now remain ing idle on the spot ; the Goodwin Co.'s mill, (four stamps,) fate uukuown ; and the mill of Mr. Atchison, (five stamps,) now iu operation in Battle Mountain district. Buena Vista district. \u2014 This district lies for about eight miles along Buena Vista canon, one of the side canons of a large desert valley par- allel with the Humboldt and eastward of it. A fine stream of water flows through this canon and \"sinks\" in the great valley three miles below. By utilizing the fall of this stream a good many stamps could be driven by its power. This is only done at oue mill at present- The district contains numerous locations on which a good deal of work has been performed; but few are now under active development. The country rock is mainly quartzite and porphyry, but the tops of the moun- tains are capped with limestone and calcareous shales. It has been the complaint of the miners here that their veins were -'bottom up,\" i. e., that instead of increasing in width aud value with depth, they narrowed or \" petered out.\" This has been in fact the experience of many of the locators. The explanation I conceive to be this : First, there is no law that causes fissure-veins to increase or improve in depth. Experience gives as many examples on one side as the other. Secondly, the veins of Buena Vista occur parallel to each other, and in groups. Every main fissure has subordinate fissures by its side, and the latter, at some com- paratively slight depth, pinch together to a mere seam, and probably join the master-lode. Unfortunately, however, it is not easy to decide"], [134, "122 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES at the outcrop which is the permanent lode ; and as the mining law allows every outcrop to receive a separate location, several owners must be disappointed for every one that succeeds. There are a number of well-opened and evidently permanent veins in the district, and many more which have \" given out\" and are abandoned. This and Star district, near by, afford a good illustration of the unwisdom of our United States mining law, which forbids the obtaining of more than the right to one outcrop under one patent \u2014 a point to be hereafter discussed. Buena Vista district was organized in 1861. But few of the mines have been worked since 1805, yet operations have never been allowed to entirely die out, Unionville, the county seat of Humboldt, is in this caiion. The hills around have some fine grass, and the whole canon Avears an appearance of verdure and beauty most refreshing. Aanong the mines I can only mention a few. On the north side of the canon is located the Persia series, comprising the National, Governor Downey, and Alba Nueva ledges. A tunnel 100 feet long exposes the latter, a fine-looking vein, two or three feet thick, with north and south course, well-defined walls, aud dip east 50\u00b0. Next aboATe, and parallel, is the Downey, opened with a pit of 25 feet, and remarkable for containing free gold. The ledge is narrower than the former. Still further up the hill a shaft of 85 feet shoAvs the National to be a well-defined vein, about as large as the Alba Nueva, and dipping east 75\u00b0. The county assessor reports that several tons of ore froin this vein, worked at the Pioneer mill, yielded $150 per ton in gold. No work has been done on the Persia series since 1865. On the south side of Eagle caiion, one of three forks into which Buena Vista caiion divides, a little above the mines just described, lies the property of the Seminole company, com prising the Cass, Joe Pickering, Halleck, Seminole, and Eagle ledges. The first and last of these show well in shafts 40 or 50 feet deep, and the ores contain gold as well as sih*er. At the time of my visit, I believe work was still going on in a tunnel cross-cutting the whole series. The first ledge was expected to be reached in 325 feet from daylight, and considerably more than half this distance had been accomplished. On the other side of Eagle canon there is a tunnel about 100 feet long, intended to cut a lode called the Leroy, the cropping of which was very encouraging. There are no mines of importance beyond this to the north and west boundary lines of the district, the ground being occupied with what is called iu that country a \"thick growth \" of cedar and mountain mahogany, from which wood (at $10 per cord for cedar, and $15 for mahogany) is supplied at Unionville, Another and more important group of mines is found southwest of the Pioneer mill, Avhich stands on Buena Vista creek, just below Unionville. About a mile distant, on the north side of Peru gulch, is the Agamemnon ledge, coursing west of north, dipping* east 75\u00b0, exposed bjT a shaft 50 feet deep in a width of five feet, Assays have been high. A tunnel is being run to cut the ledge at a depth of 200 feet. The Champion and Cedar Hill claims, on the Champion ledge, are parallel with the Agamemnon, and a little fur ther south. They haA*e been considerably talked about as ATery rich, especially in gold ; but the evidence is not quite clear. The Agamem non bestrides the high diAride between Peru gulch and Buena Vista caiion. On the west of that divide occurs the Manitowoc, a remarkable vein, encased in calcareous shales which cap the hill, and striking north 37\u00b0 west, Avith a dip nearly horizontal. The -width varies from six inches to four feet, aA*eraging two and a half or three feet. The shales seem to have nearly or quite the same strike and dip as the vein. But the remarkable feature of this deposit is its continuity with two others, one"], [135, "123 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. northeast and the other southwest of the Avorks on the Mauitowoc. These are not \" extensions,\" in the ordinary sense, but outcrops of the same claim. The vein begins to pitch about 45\u00b0 southwest, but at 25 feet it breaks to the almost horizontal position shown in the Mauitowoc, and maintains this position for nearly 300 feet, Avhen it suddenly resumes again its original dip of 45\u00b0 southwest. I think this broken dip is the result of a slip of part of the mountain. The slates enclosing the vein appear to follow its changes ; and this excludes the idea of an original irregularity ofthe fissure. On the three portions ofthe vein thus divided, these locations have been made. The upper one is at present a mere pit ; the middle one is the Mauitowoc ; and the third is the Arizona. The workings on the two latter are somewhat extensive. The incline winze of the Arizona is nearly 80 feet deep. At the time of my visit, (August, 1808,) the daily production of ore Avas about 12 tons; the mining cost Avas $8 or $10 per ton ; but this was considered temporarily high ; hauling to mill, down a very steep road, $4 per ton. The ore consists of chloride of shVer, with various salts of lead, and some sulphuret of sih*er, with traces of copper. It is worked in two mills, one belonging to the Pion- eer company, and one to Fall & Temple, who own the mines. At the former mill, the pidp assays haAre averaged $97 per ton ; at the latter, $110. The difference is due to the fact that the former mill has been running a much longer time. The bullion is ATery fine, and Avorth, I am told, some $20 per pound, owing to the presence of gold in the silver. The shipments of bullion by J. C. Fall and Fall & Temple, given in this chapter, from October 13, 1807, when the Pioueer mill started, to August 20, 1868, were from the mines just described. The North Star and Atlas are claimed as southern extensions of the Mauitowoc. The southern boundary of Buena Vista district is formed by Cottonwood- creek, which might furnish water-power for mills, but has not yet been utilized. The cost of tunnelling in this district ranges from $8 to $20 per running foot ; shafting costs from $15 to $30. There are two stamp mills in the district, the names of which we have giA'en above. The upper one is the Pioneer, a small, old-fashioned, eight- stamp mill with double stems, run by water-power. Screens used, No. 50. There are eight small Knox pans, with a total daily capacity to amalga- mate four or fiAre tons of pulp. As the stamps could crush more than this, they are only run half the time. No roasting is practiced, and con- siderable loss is the natural result, the pulp assaying $97 and the tailings $40. This loss is not absolute, however, for the tailings are caught in a large reserA^oir, where they rapidly dry*, and are preserved for future treatment. At present it will not pay to work them 0ATer. The lower mill is Fall and Temple's. It is driven by steam, sage brush and grease wood being the fuel under the boiler. There are ten stamps, six Varuey, and two large Wheeler pans; all flat-bottomed. The stamps weigh about 800 pounds, and are run at about 75 drops to the minute ; screens, No. 40. This is a new mill, and was not adjusted to successful running at the time of my visit. It was producing A*ery fine bullion, but at a Arery great loss, the pulp assaying $110 and the tailings $00. Capacity, 14 tons daily. The shipments of bullion from Uniomille from October 13, 1867, to August 20, 1868, amount to some $90,000, and I estimate the total shipments for 1808 at $150,000, mostly the product of the two mills just mentioned. Central district. \u2014 The reappearance of the Humboldt range, on the north side of the river, is called Eugene mountain, and the south end of this mountain is Central district. The famous mine known as the \" 50\" is in this district, scarcely half a mile from the bank of the Humboldt."], [136, "124 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES The vein is generally supposed to be about 50 feet wide ; the lode strikes north and south, along the western slope of the low foot hills. It is easily accessible by wagon road. The ore seems thus far to occur in bauds from one to four feet thick, very rich in copper, and worth, it is said, some $50 and upwards per ton in silver. About 150 feet of tunnel and 00 feet of shaft constituted the workings up to September. The Unionville Register, October 24, says that the owners of the 50 mine have made arrangements to ship by the Central Pacific railroad 10 tons of ore to San Francisco. This Avill'be the first shipment of ore made by the railroad company, but it is anticipated that a large business will be done in the Avay of back freights, as it is understood that the company Avill offer great inducements to parties owning Ioav grade or refractory ores Avhich cannot be worked with profit at the mines. This mine, in particular, is A*ery favorably located for such slrpments, and the percentage of cop per in the ore is au element of profit at San Francisco, though entirely Avorthless at the mine, inasmuch as it cannot be extracted by the ordi nary mill process. The sudden opening of a market for base-metal ores is producing in many districts a revolution iu the notions of miners, and Humboldt county in particular, Avhich has suffered heretofore in com parison with the pure ruby ores of districts further south, is beginning to find advantage in the copper, lead, and antimony for which it has hitherto been scorned. This will be more strikingly illustrated in the sequel by the experience of the Montezuma company, in Trinity district. Central district contains, besides the mine already alluded to, a number of outcrops of argentiferous galena, AA*hich -will, doubtless, for the reasons just mentioned, soon receive the attention of miners. This district Avas organized in 1802. Eldorado district. \u2014 This district is also one of the early ones, having been organized in 1862. It is situated nearly under Star Peak, on the Avestern side ofthe Humboldt range. I believe there is nothing doing in the district at present. The Banner mine, owned by the Eldorado com pany, has been developed at an expense of about $10,000 in coin. It has about 250 feet of tunnel, and 80 feet of inclined shaft. The results of these explorations haA*e been highly encouraging, but the owners resolved, some three years ago, to wait for the railroad to cheapen the cost of work. As the whole body of the ledge is considered to yield an average of $90 per ton, it is to be expected that operations will soon be resumed upon it, since the railroad is finished within a short distance. Other mines in this dis trict are the Corinth series, the New England series, the Mount Carmel, &c. All the A*eins of the district have limestone for the country rock, a fact which, in A'iew of frequent experience in Nevada, may throw some doubt on their character as true fissures, permanent in depth. Gold Run district. \u2014 This is one of the recent discoveries, organized in 1800. The principal mines are the Golconda, Cumberland, and Jefferson. The Golconda is au immense mass of ore, Avhether a fissure vein or not does not yet clearly appear. A shaft 80 feet deep has been sunk iu a solid bed of ore, which is further exposed by a large open excavation. There is, consequently, a great deal of milling rock in sight. This mine is an acknowledged success. I believe there are tAvo mills running on the ore ; Negus's mill, 8 stamps and 13 pans, 7 miles from the mine, and Holt's Winueraucca mill, just niOA'ed over to Golconda, The Cumber laud, one and a half mile south of the Golconda, a well-defined vein 10 feet \"wide, striking north and south, dipping west 45\u00b0, has been developed by a shaft some 50 feet deep, and prospecting is still going on. The ore assays well, and the outcrop of the vein is prominent for 1,000 feet. A half mile further south is the Jefferson, also a promising mine, but at"], [137, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 125 present lying idle for want of means. The railroad, which passes Avithin seven miles, and the Humboldt canal, which already brings water 40 miles to Winnemacca, Avill be of benefit to Gold Run district. Humboldt district. \u2014 The oldest in the county, organized 1860; lies on the west slope of Star mountains, five miles from the Humboldt, two and a half miles from the railroad, 10 miles from Unionville, and 175 miles from Virginia City ; contains Humboldt City, the first settlement in the county. There is an immense bed of sulphur near the town, and a good deal of fine agricultural land along the Humboldt creek and riA*er. The ATeins ofthe district are mostly in the quartzite or siliceous porphyry of the Star range. The Starlight, Calaveras, Sigel, Adriatic, Winnemueca, Washington, and San Bernard and others have been prospected. The Calaveras is said to carry black sulphuret of silver ; the Sigel, gold ; the rest, argentiferous galena. None of these mines are producing, but renewed, activity is expected now that the railroad has reached them, and ores of galena, in particular, have acquired a market value. Oro Fino district. \u2014 Organized 1803. Situated in the first east range beyond that which contains Humboldt City, Star City, and Unionville. Starting from a point on the Humboldt mer, about 25 miles aboA*e Humboldt City, and running south along the range, the first ten miles constitute Sierra district, and the next eight, including both sides of the range, Oro Fino. The geological features of both districts are Avestward dipping beds of quartzites, with limestone overlying, which latter, crop ping on the eastern side ofthe mountains at the summit, and dipping Avest, makes the Avestern slope appear to be entirely lime, and the east ern slope, until the summit be reached, entirely quartzite. A landmark in Oro Fino district is an immense ledge of brilliant, opaque Avhite quartz, coursing and dipping Avith the rocks, and from 6 to 30 feet in width. It is called the Great Eastern, and located as a mine; but it appears to be barren. The Natchez and Yosemite are more promising*. The latter A*ein is now considered the principal ore in the district, and owned by the California Navigation Company, who propose to work it. Sacramento district. \u2014 About 15 miles south of Unionville, on the stage road. The outcrops are large aud prominent. The Montana ledge is owned by the Nevada company, which has also a fine mill on the Hum boldt seven miles away. Mine and mill are now idle, but the company has applied for a United States patent on the A*ein. The Rochester company on the same ledge, south, appear to work by fits and starts. The Sacramento and Bullion properties are highly spoken of, but not uoav actively worked. Here, too, people were last summer waitiug for the railroad. Sierra district. \u2014 Situation defined aboATe, under the Oro Fino. The toAvn of Dun Glen in the centre of the district, is about 25 miles north east of Unionville, 20 miles from Star, seven miles from Mill City, and five miles from the Humboldt river. A small but constant stream runs through the toAvn. The Tallulah mines, on the Neptune series of ledges, a mile and a half northwest of Dun Glen, has been opened by a tunnel of 500 feet, cutting three of the parallel veins into an average depth of 200 feet. These veins are said to be each three feet wide, coursing north and south, and pitching west 45\u00b0. The ore assays high, but a small lot, tried in the Essex mill, did not give satisfactory results by the ordinary Washoe process, without roasting. It is probably autimonial sulphurets of sih*er. Nothing of importance has been done on the mine since November, 18G5. On the same series, apparently, are located the Empire and Essex claims. The ledges in these are also Avell defined, with polished walls, and sulphureted ores of silver. Drifts and inclines,"], [138, "126 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES besides a tunnel of 630 feet cross-cutting the Essex, and a tunnel of 320 feet in the Empire, cross-cutting the Ophir ledge, have been opened. Expectations were very high at one time ; but the Essex mill is now idle for want of ore. The Gem of Sierra, five miles from Dun Glen, is in limestone country rock, is 22 inches Avide, runs east and west, dips south 70\u00b0, and contains sulphuret and chloride of silver, with a little carbonate of copper. The decomposed condition of the ore makes it easy to work. Over $40,000 in bullion, 984-1000ths fine, have been taken from this ore at Fall's Pioneer mill, Unionville, 20 miles from the mine. The average yield is said to haA'e been $175 per ton. Yet the mine Avas not being Avorked when I visited Humboldt county, and there was a rumor that the vein had been lost. A large vein of similar ore to that of the Mon- tezuma iu Trinity district, described below, has been fouud in the east- ern slope of the mountain, four miles from Dun Glen. It is called the Chattanooga. The ore contains about 50 per cent, of lead, (and anti- mony ! ) and is said to yield by common pau process $40 per ton, silver. The Chrysopolis is half-way between the Gem and Dun Glen. It is a vein of brilliant white quartz, in state, with defined walls, striking north 38\u00b0 Avest, and dipping northeast 48\u00b0. This mine belonged to what is now the Montezuma company, formerly, I belie\\-e, the Trinity and Sac- ramento. The company had a mill at Etna, which has since been remoA*ed to Oreana, and the Chrysopolis, after having been considerably Avorked, has been temporarily, at least, abandoned. The Monroe series of ledges, one mile southeast of Dun Glen, is different from the rest of the district in bearing, not silver, but gold \u2014 free, and in sulphurets. The returns made to the county assessor for the first two quarters of 1866, state the average yield of ores reduced from January 1 to April 1 to be $526 29 per ton; from April 1 to July 2, $279 05 per tou. These were small lots of selected ore, hauled to Wiunemacca, 50 miles, and worked in Holt's mill, which is now i._OA*ed to Golconda. An attempt to reduce Monroe gold ore in the Essex silver mill, nearer home, resulted in the extraction of $12 16 per ton. The working of the mine on a regular scale has not yet proved successful ; but the proprietors are still per- severing, and profess great faith in the value of the property. Besides the mining operations aboAre mentioned, Sierra district contains the usual quantity of \" locations,\" not sufficiently developed to Avarraut fur- ther notice. The district Avas organized in 1863. Star district is one of the most celebrated in the county, and perhaps the one which has experienced the most sudden transition from a con- dition of enterprise, hope, and even actual prosperity, to abandonment and despair. It was organized in 1861, aud lies immediately north of Buena Vista district, Star City being 12 miles from Unionville. The mountain range here runs north and south, and attaius iu Star Peak its greatest altitude \u2014 11,000 feet. The distance from the foot-hills to the summit, on the eastern slope, is about four miles, and this is the width of the district, which is about six miles long from north to south. A deep and wide canon, dropping suddenly from the very summit-ridge and running east to the A'alley, bisects the district, and gathers all its Avaters into Star creek, a stream of more than ordinary size and perma- nence for this region, carrying 70 miners' inches in the driest summer mouths, and swelling to 200 or 300 inches in the early summer, after the melting of the snows. As rain is almost unknown here, the creek is fed entirely from the accumulated snow in the mountaius; and its size and extraordinary permanence are due to the great area drained by the Star canon, which collects a A*ast quantity of shoav in the winter, and to the unusual height of the range at this point, Avhich allows this snow to"], [139, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 127 melt slowly, and preserves some patches of it till winter comes again. In the latter part of August, I found snow still lying several thousand feet below the summit of Star Peak. The result of this topographical peculiarity of the district is a much more verdant and fertile caiion than the traveller ordinarily finds in this region. Star City, two and a half miles up the caiion, has a pretty location, and has been a flourishing town, with two hotels, post office, and daily United States mail, a Wells- Fargo express office, a telegraph office, connected by a special line Avith Virginia City, and a populatiou of more than 1,000 souls. So sudden has been its decline that the daily mail, the express office, and the telegraph office are all in operation yet, though the entire population consists of a single family, the head of which is mayor, constable, postmaster, express agent, telegraph operator, aud, I believe, sole and unanimous Aoter! The city was built of adobe, stone, and wood. WhateA*er Avas movable has been carried away; but the adobe and stone houses, outlasting the industry that created them, are still in tolerable condition, and it would require nothing but the resumption of work on one or two of the mines to call back to Star City its former glory. The proprietors of some of the best mines intend to renew Avorking soon, it is said ; but iu this case I do not feel so confident of their immediate actiA*ity as in others, for the district is on the opposite side of the mountains from the Humboldt A*al ley, and consequently from the railroad. It will not be so quick to feel the stimulus which the completion of the road imparts to the regions traversed by it. Still, it is certain that sooner or later this district will receive attention once more; and this fact, together Avith the great fame Avhich it formerly enjoyed, wdl Avarrant a description of its principal fea tures. The strata of the country rock dip west, into the mountain. In ascend ing the canon, the first formation crossed is that whicii has frequently been called \" quartzite,\" for want of a better name. It is a highly silicous, metamorphosed rock, and probably the same, essentially, as a good deal of the \" porphyry*\" of Humboldt county. In Star canon, this rock, wheu freshly broken, is gray, but changes on exposure to brown. The next layer aboA*e is a gray limestone, dipping west about 00\u00b0, bedded iu layers of a few inches' thickness, the whole group being about 100 yards thick. Next aboA*e this rock, and still more extensively displayed, is a black limestone, in Avhich seAreral silver-bearing A*eins haA*e been discoATered. The black limestone is succeeded by a hard, bluish rock, and this again by Avhat appears to be black slate. Between the last two formations occurs the famous Sheba belt, or ore-channel, which is claimed to be 150 feet wide. Both the geological indications of the spot nd the history of the mine favor the opinion that the Sheba is not a fissure vein. If it is so, then it is one of those immense Aeins which, like the Comstock, con tains a great many other things besides ore. The special deposit or chamber in the Sheba is all worked out. The mine is not in operation; but the De Soto, directly across the canon, contains some of the same rich ore as was formerly found in the Sheba; and it will be operated, I am told, by a San Francisco company. A union of the two claims Avould be a good thing for both. The Sheba mill, of 10 stamps, four reverbera tories, six pans, two settlers, steam power, &c, is situated in the large valley at the mouth of the caiiou. It is in good condition, and is said to have reduced quite satisfactorily (with the aid of roasting) the refractory ores of the district. The \" pulp \" from dry crushing is draAvn up by means of fans from the battery-screens into an elevated bin, and by this means a space is left in Avhich the usual sluices can be set for wet crushing. The mill is thus made available for either process."], [140, "128 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES No work has been done on the Sheba mine for more than 18 months, though previous to that time several hundred thousand dollars Avere expended. The ore is an antimonial sulphuret of silver and baser metals, (a peculiar fahlerz,) and occurs in chambers, of which it is highly prob able that more remain in the mine, besides the one or tAvo already exhausted. The temporary failure of the enterprise is due, partly, to extravagant management while the rich ore continued, and partly to the lack of a proper system of economical and judicious prospecting. There is no test of skill in mining more severe than the management of a mine in such ground. Anybody can work a \" bonanza ;\" the large profits coArer all mistakes, and the happy stockholders make no inquiries. But the science at which lucky miners are accustomed to sneer, is invoked by them, often too late, when they have wasted their luck, and the dark day of \" dead work,\" for Avhich they made no provision, has come upon them. An interesting commentary upon miners' law is the fact that the Sheba mine and mill were both \"jumped \"during the last year; that is, re-located and claimed as a new discovery, under the laws of the Star district. It seems that the miners of that district, anxious to \" keep things lively,\" made it necessary for every claimant to do a certain amount of work annually, or forfeit his claim. As the Sheba had lain idle for a year, some enterprising parties from a neighboring district thought they would appropriate mine, mill, and all ; and certainly they Avould haA*e good standing in \" laAv,\" if not in equity, but for another peculiarity in the Avonderful code Avhich still holds sway in the now all but uninhabited district. For, in their laudable desire to push things, the miners of Star once on a time passed an amendment to their law providing that if any person would do in one year the \" assessment Avork\" of two, his title should be secure for three years without further performance. Afterwards, changing their minds, they repealed this provision, but not until the Sheba mine had more than satisfied its requirements. As all these matters are to be proATed, not by legal records, but by newspaper extracts and the memory of witnesses now scattered in other districts, the affair is a promising one for the lawyers. Those who profess to wonder why capital is not more freely i invested in property, the ATery title to which is at the niercy of a mass-meeting of temporary colonists, may perhaps find food for reflection in this incident. Opposite the Sheba, on the south side of Star creek, is the De Soto, already7 alluded to. The location comprises 2,100 feet, aud its southern extension, the Whitmore, is 1,500 feet long, followed by the American Basin, 1,800 feet. The Whitmore, owned by a London company, has a tunnel of 500 feet, and the American Basin, owned principally by a New York company, has a tunnel of 1,000 feet. The former is not yet near the line of the ATein, and the latter is supposed to be near it, but has not cut it. All the tunnelling is in ATery hard rock, and cost at least $25 gold per linear foot. Above the Sheba belt the black slate, interstratified with gray lime stone, extends up the mountain for three-fourths of a mile, Avhen it changes to quartzite. In this rock are the Mammoth series of A*eins, carrying hard, brittle quartz, with disseminated galena. The ore is argentiferous. AboATe this series, and almost at the summit of the ridge, is the Mountain Top series, containing the great San Bernard ledge \u2014 a wall of brilliant, white, barren quartz, striking northeast and southwest, and visible from a distance of 10 miles. This ledge, coursing as it does across, not with, the strata, is the only unmistakable fissure vein in the district, but unfortunately that is its sole merit. It has been but little"], [141, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 129 worked, and offers no encouragement to mining. In former times the Perigard Tunnel Company proposed to run a tunnel through the moun tain into the Humboldt valley, a distance of two miles, and the work was said to be under way, but I found no traces of it, Trinity district. \u2014 This is one of the most interesting localities to the mining engineer and metallurgist in all the west. It is the seat of the famous Oreana smelting works. The district was organized in June, 1863. It is situated on the west bank of the Humboldt, 25 miles north of Humboldt lake, and 30 miles southwest of Unionville. A small por tion of the district, in a projecting group of the Trinity mountains, is known as Arabia, and comprises the most noted mines \u2014 the Montezuma, Jersey, Savannah, Sultana series, Chloride, Guatimozin, Tontine, Eagle, Duuderberg, Ne Plus, Bald Hornet, Daisy, and Oxide. In these veins the same phenomenon has been observed as in other districts of Hum boldt county. They occur in groups of parallel course, and some of them pinch out to a mere seam at no great depth. This is the reason why so many locations in Humboldt county cover, not single veins, but series. The miners found that it was necessary to allow such locations, as no man could be sure of an independent vein in a single outcrop. The application of the United States law, forbidding the grant of more than one outcrop within the space covered by the patent, would work mis chief here. The Montezuma mine was the only one actively worked at the time of my visit. The vein crops out ou the south side of a shallow canon, while most of the neighboring mines are on the north slope. Their course is north 10\u00b0 east, while that of the Montezuma is nearly east and west, and the canon runs nearly northeast and southwest. The country rock is porphyry, and the ledge dips north between well-marked casings, at an angle of 45\u00b0. The outcrop is 11 feet wide, and the vein in depth averages seven feet. At the lowest point exposed, (150 feet on the incline, at the bottom of a prospecting shaft,) there is still a vein of six feet. The longitudinal extent of the workings is about 500 feet ; the whole claim covers 2,000 feet. As the mine is at least 500 feet above the Humboldt, aud the vein-matter exceedingly decomposed, it is not surprising that it contains no water. This and the Liberty mine, iu San Antonio district, Nye county, are the driest I have visited. The work ings on the Montezuma consist of a deep open cut, and inclines to a depth of 80 feet, opening good ground, besides the 150 feet exploring shaft already mentioned. About 1,500 tons of ore have been already extracted, and 1 estimate the reserves in sight at 1,200 tons more. The ore is very friable, consisting of salts of lead and antimony, (cerus site, antimony spar, antiinonic oxide,) in a gangue of quartz and felspar. The value in silver ranges from $60 per ton upwards. The present average yield at the works is $80. The Jersey ledge, which strikes north-northeast and intersects (as is supposed) the Montezuma, answers to the same description, except that the average width is three feet, and the average yield of silver per ton $40. This would not pay for work ing, nor indeed does the $80 of Montezuma ore leave a very large mar gin ; but both these mines are enhanced in value to a remarkable degree by the railroad, which now passes within sight of them. Their base metal, amouuting to 40 or 50 per cent, of the ore, is now worth as much as the silver, as will be seen presently. The Jersey has been well opened by inclines to the depth of 60, 800, and 100 feet, and drifts connecting them. There are at least 2,000 tons of ore exposed. The claim is 1,200 feet, for 1,000 of which the outcrop has been traced. The mine has H. Ex. Doc. 54 9"], [142, "130 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES been idle, waiting for the railroad, but the work will soon be actively prosecuted. Mr. Nason, the energetic and skilfid superintendent of the Monte- zuma company, deserves the highest praise for the perseverance and talent with which he has redeemed what was at the outset as decided a failure as any iu Nevada. I do not mean to enter upon the history of the enterprise in wliich he was at first engaged, further than to say that the removal of the company's original mill from Etna to Oreaua, the acquisition of the Montezuma mine, the bold plan Of erecting furnaces and smelting the ore in a region so destitute of fuel, and in the absence of all precedent or experience of the kind in Nevada\u2014 these are all parts of a Napoleonic policy by which oue man was able to wrest victory from disaster. I wish such cases were more numerous ; but, in general, the despair and apathy of American capitalists at their first discouragement are equal to their credulity and extravagant expectation at the outset ; and their agents are not able to rescue them from the consequences of their first blunders. Mr. Nason's works at Oreaua are in some respects quite original. Mr. Clarence King's exploring party have drawings of them, which will doubtless be published ; and I shall confine myself to a brief description. The works stand on the bank of the Humboldt, about a mile from the Central Pacific railroad. The custom department contains five light stamps, three flat-bottomed pans, and one settler. This machinery, used for reducing such ores as can be treated by the Washoe process, is driven by an engine of about 25 horse-power, which keeps in motion, also, the blower for the shaft furnace. The process employed for the Montezuma ore is direct smelting with fluxes, and subsequent calcination and cupel- lation. The ore contains about 50 per cent, of lead and antimony, and $80 of silver to the ton. The method of treatment is as follows : The ore, reduced to about egg-size with a Blake crusher, is mixed on the charging floor with a flux consisting of 20 parts of soda and 80 of lime. The materials for this flux are gathered from the alkaline deposits of the valley and foot-hills. The most desolate and forbidding feature of the country thus turns out to be an important element of future wealth. The flux is added to the ore generally in equal weight, and the .vhole is charged with charcoal into the furnace. About once in seven minutes two shovelfuls of charcoal and four of the mixed ore and flux are charged. This represents about 12 bushels of charcoal, or 225 pounds, per ton of ore. Considering that Mr. Nason has paid as much as 65 cents a bushel for charcoal, and that he can now obtain it for 25 cents, by means of the railroad, the economy in this one item is evidently enough to pay a handsome profit to the company. The furnace will melt about 12 tons of ore daily, producing 30 to 35 pigs of metal every shifts or about 10,000 pounds in 24 hours. The discharge of cinder is continuous ; but the metal is drawn off once in an hour and a half or two hours, when from four to six pigs, or 300 to 450 pounds, are obtained. This metal is au alloy of antimony and lead, containing about $200 per ton in silver. There are two furnaces in the works for the production of the crude metal, but only one was running at the time of my visit. There are also four large reverberatories, in which the crude metal was formerly calcined and purified of antimony. These furnaces were able to calcine a charge of 16 tous in 14 days. They are now superseded by the arrangement which the railroad has enabled the company to make with parties in San Francisco. The same is true, also, of the cupelling-furnace, a very neat structure, with movable test, raised or lowered with screws. The silver produced from this establishment was 997 and 998 thousandths"], [143, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 131 fine. The antimony was formerly thrown away as refuse, but has become valuable for type-metal, Babbitt's metal, &c. Still the prices of transportation were such previous to the completion of the railroad that the lead and antimony produced could scarcely be said to find a profit able market, and the silver had to pay all costs. All this is now bravely chauged. The operations of calcination and cupellation are no longer carried on; the crude pigs from the shaft- furnace are sold directly to Selby and Co., of San Francisco, who pay $100 per ton for the base metal, and $1 per ouuce for the silver it contains. The favorable effect thus produced upon the business of the Montezuma company is typical of the good results which will follow the introduction of the railroad in all our mining districts. The running expenses and profits of the Oreana works may be sketched as follows, on the basis of the single shaft fur nace in operation at the time of my visit : MINING COST. Twelve tons of ore daily, mined and hauled to mill $84 REDUCTION COST, 12 TONS DAILY. Four smelters, two at $5, and two at $2 50 15 Two engineers, at $4 8 Five laborers, feeders, &c, at $3 15 Two cords of wood, at $15 30 Limestone, iron, horse feed, &c 10 Charcoal, 144 bushels, at 25 cents 36 Total daily labor and material 198 Add for superintendence, office, &c 25 Transportation 4.8 tons metal to San Francisco 144 Total cost of metal from 12 tons ore 367 VALUE OP METAL IN SAN FRANCISCO. Four and eight-tenths tons lead and antimony, at $100 $480 Three hundred and sixty ounces silver, (the average contents) at $1 360 Total 840 Subtract cost of production, &c 367 473 Any error of underestimate on the above expenses will be more than counterbalanced by the fact that labor is reckoned at former rates, and that a great reduction might be effected in that item, especially by the employment of Chinamen. Of their capacity I have not the slightest doubt. Indeed, the most faithful and skilful workman that Mr. Nason ever had at his reverberatories was a Chinaman ; and a metallurgist will understand that if a Chinaman can be trusted to manage a reverberatory furnace, there is nothing which he may not, under proper direction and supervision, be trusted to do in the whole field of the reduction of ores. I incline strongly to the opinion that our much needed supply of skilled labor in metallurgy is to come, in the Pacific States, from the patient and imitative Chinese. An inspection of the figures above given shows the interesting fact"], [144, "132 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES that the silver alone does not quite pay the expense of working. In point of fact, when the silver was produced at Oreana, there was no transpor tation of base metal to be paid, so that item of $144 falls aAvay ; but, ou the other hand, there was a heavy expense for calcination and cupilla tion, which was not balanced by the fact that, when the sih'er was at last refined, the company received $1 30 per ounce for it, instead of $1 as now. In a word, the railroad has made all the difference between paying expenses merely, and paying 100 per cent, profit over expenses, iu this one representative case. The Oreana enterprise is one of the few Avhich rest upon a sound economical basis, comprising the utilization of all the valuable ingredients contained in its raw material. Winnem ucca district, about 40 miles north of Oreana, on the west side of the Humboldt, comprises the Winnemucca, a large A*ein, owned by eastern capitalists, but not yet developed ; the Union series, now owned and worked by a New York company, and said to be valuable ; the Pride of the Mountain, belonging to a French company, (the owner of the Humboldt canal,) Avhich is still experimenting upon the refractory ore ; and a hundred other locations uot yet deA'eloped. Bullion shipments from Unionville, Humboldt county, Nevada. \u2014 These shipments were made through the express office of Wells, Fargo & Co., and, as the express charges were generally very high, (to cover the risk as Avell as cost of transportation,) being frequently three per cent, on the amount declared, it was customary for shippers of bullion to assume part of the risk tkemseh-es, by declaring at the office an amount less than was actually delivered. The excess of actual over reported value is at least 33^ per cent., and sometimes more. I have added a column with this correction : Shipments of bullion from Unionville, Humboldt county, Nevada.

NOTES ON MONTANA. By Professor A. K. Eaton, assisted by W. S. Keyes, Esq., Captain W. W. De Lacy, and others. CHAPTER XII. GENERAL GEOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THE TERRITORY. Rocks, representing the three grand divisions of geological time, are more equally distributed in the Territory of Montana, perhaps, than in any other part of the continent. Granite and other arzoic rocks, secondary limestones and sandstones, and extensive tertiary deposits lie literally side by side in nearly every part of the Territory as yet examined. The azoic rocks are represented by granite, gneiss, and trappean rocks, the latter principally dioritic in their character, but sometimes assuming the trachytic, amygdaloid or basaltic characteristics. Owing to the partially metamorphic condition of the secondary rocks, their relative age cannot at present be determined. Very few fossils are found in them, and those usually quite indistinct. The tertiary deposits are very distinctly marked, and generally quite undisturbed, showing no marks of metamorphic action. If we should say that granite accompanied the anticlinal axes of the main mountain ranges, secondary rocks coA*ering the slopes, and terti ary deposits lying horizontally in the valleys, it would express with ac curacy the geological character of much ofthe Territory, especially that portion lying above the forks of the Missouri riA*er. It is true that gran ite does not form uninterruptedly the crests of the mountain ranges, but its frequent appearance at their higher points strongly suggests conti nuity along the whole axis of elevation, though concealed beneath second ary rocks that often coA*er the mountains to their summits. To the subordinate ranges and spars the rule does not so generally apply, many of the latter especially shoAving only secondary rocks, or, as is frequently, the case, showing gneiss or granite at the point where they leave the main range only secondary rocks at their lower eleArations. The following are the more marked localities in the occupied portions of the Territory when the azoic rocks predominate. On entering the Territory by the Avest from Salt Lake, we find a broken mountain range, lying between the Beaver Head and Black Tail Deer creeks. This is mainly gneiss, so far as examined, but showing occa sional masses of trap. As there haA7e been no mines of value developed in this range, comparatively little can be said of it. About 50 miles northwest of this range is Bald mountain, the most prominent and picturesque peak in BeaA'er Head county. Though C0Arered on the southerly slope with secondary rock to the ATery summit, it is a mountain of true granite. Its altitude, determined both by tri angulation and by barometric measurement, is about 4,500 feet above the valley of the Grasshopper creek, but though apparently the most prominent peak in the vicinity, and so considered by the inhabitants, a"], [147, "135 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. visit to the summit will discover a still higher peak about 12 miles north- Avest, probably having an altitude of 1,000 feet greater than Bald mountain. This has beeu named Torrey's peak, but so far as is knoAvn has never been ascended. These, with their smaller associates, form an interesting cluster of granite mountain peaks, and so far as has been discovered furnish the only instance of the existence of true granite Avithin the limits of Beaver Head county, Avith the exception of its occasional appearance upon the crest of the main range, the latter forming the boundary of the county on three sides. Crossing the Black Tail Deer in the direction of Virginia City, we strike a mountain spur extending northward from the main chain, this exhibits gneiss near its junction AAdth the main range, but the northerly portion, lying west of the Stinking-water river, is Avholly secondary in its character. The Tobacco Route range, as it is sometimes called, lying between the Madison riA*er and the Stinking- water, exhibits mainly rocks of the azoic age, principally gneiss iuterupted by trappean masses, but sometimes showing true granite. This range, above or north ofVirginia City, on Alder gulch, is princi pally gneissoid in its character, but at the point where the city is located the range is cut by an extensiA^e mass of trap, stretching from the hill east of the toAvn nearly to the Eight-mile house at the eastern foot of the range, and having a breadth of three or four miles. Following the range northerly for many miles, we find on the Avest side gneiss only, cut, howeA*er, by dikes of trap, but as we approach the Jefferson riArer the range changes in its character, the rocks becoming mostly secondary. Examining the range along its eastern slope, the gneiss changes to granite proper, as we approach the town of Sterling, but is still bouuded by gneiss further east. The formation where the town is located and the mountain side west of it is granite, but following the Hot Spring creek easterly to the old crossing we find an abrupt change to gneiss. Near this point we find au eruptiATe mass of trap of peculiar form, known as Flat Top Butte. Situated near this butte is the hot spring from which the stream de riA*es its name. There are many of a similar character in the Territory, and a general description of this Avill apply to nearly all. The water, which issues in considerable ATolume, is almost perfectly pure, quite as much so as the water of the purest cold springs. The temperature, A-ary ing but slightly through the different seasons of the year, is about 133\u00b0 Fahrenheit in this aud the majority of springs examined, but in rare instances it is as high as 100\u00b0 Fahrenheit. The purity of the water is not, hoAvever, common to all these things, without exception ; the water of the hot spring of Deer Lodge ATalley being charged with carbonic acid gas, and holding considerable carbonate of lime in solution. The rapid escape of the gas in this case gives an appearance of ebullition, and the carbonate of lime, no longer capable of being held in solution by the de carbonated water, is deposited. Thus an incrustation of carbonate of lime has been formed by the water, until a hemispherical mound about 30 feet in height has been formed, to the top of which the Water rises in its central well. The only peculiarity observed in connection Avith the hot springs of pure Avater is the unusual vegetable growth upon the grounds watered by them, including a rapid propagation of water plants proper. The latter effect is demonstrated AvheneA*er the Avater is alloAved to run through open troughs of wood, the whole surface of the troughs beneath the water being coATered, in a few days, with a rich green con fervoid groAvth."], [148, "136 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES These springs, so far as examined, are found near the juncture of granite and sedimentary rocks. If it wore not already sufficiently proven by other facts, the character of purity exhibited by these thermal waters would demonstrate that this heat is derived from deep subter ranean channels of high temperature, through which the water passed before reaching the surface, rather than from any chemical reaction of Avater upon mineral matter. The bearing of the study of thermal springs upon the later theories, with regard to the origin of metalliferous veins, makes all facts touching the character of such Avaters of importance. Passing northAvard across the Jefferson, by the route from Virginia City to Helena, ayo find in the Silver Star district an exposure of granite proper in Hell caiion, which changes to hornblendic gneiss, as we go east tOAvard the Jefferson river. The gneiss continues nearly to the leA*el country bordering the riA*er, where a secondary limestone makes its appearance, but is quite limited in extent. MoA'ing northward to the Boulder A*alley, we find the range lying west and north of the A*alley at that point wholly granitic ; while easterly and southerly Ave see ranges that show secondary rocks only. Still further north the town of Jefferson lies between ranges both of which are essentially azoic. The granite range dividing the waters of Prickley Pear from those of Crow creek shows an extensive mass of green stone trap at the summit. In the vicinity of Helena granite makes its appearance about three miles above the town. Its line of junction with the limestone and sandstone of the secondary can be readily traced in a southeasterly direction uutil it crosses the Prickley Pear above Prickley Pear city. The auriferous veins of the vicinity lie in the granite, and generally near the line of change of formation referred to. In addition to the localities already mentioned, the trappean rocks make their appearance at many points, and are often intimately asso ciated with the metalliferous deposits. They break through the second ary deposits at several points in BeaA*er Head county, as in the Horse Prairie, Bannock, Blue Wing, and Rattle Snake districts, and show themselves conspicuously in the northern portion of Edgerton county in large tabular masses, or characteristic shapes, like the Avell- known \"Bird tail rock.\" These masses are more generally dioritic, but sometimes exhibit several different varieties in the same immediate vicinity, as, for instance, the extensiA*e formation that underlies Virginia City, and cuts the range Avest of it. This shows, near the town, two distinct and well-marked varieties, the trachytic and amygdaloid ; but as we cross the range and begin to descend on the eastern slope by the toll road, we find the trap assuming the basaltic character, showing distinct grains of olivine. The most interesting feature connected with the trappean rocks of the Territory is that arising from their association with certain metalli ferous deposits. The auriferous veins of Bannock are wholly contact reins, lying between the secondary rocks and the erupted trap ; and the argentiferous A^eins of the Blue Wing district, as Avell as those of Argenta, are intimately associated with the trappean masses, being Avholly in the adjoining limestone, but evidently haAdng as their starting point the dividing line between the different formations. The secondary rocks of the Territory are found upon the slopes of most of the moun tain ranges, and many of the subordinate ranges and spurs show this formation almost exclusively. It is rarely that a valley is bounded on both sides by rocks of the same age. The Madison valley, bounded on the west, as Ave have already seen, mostly by azoic rocks, shows an eastern boundary of sedimentary rocks of the secondary age. These"], [149, "137 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. rocks are, in all parts of the Territory, very greatly disturbed, in some cases highly metamorphic, and in all cases more or less so. The obliteration of fossil indication by metamorphic action precludes the possibility, at present, of determining the exact geological period to which to refer the different deposits of this age. The secondary lime stone at the point of contact with the trappean masses referred to becomes white crystalline marble, but the effect is limited to the imme diate neighborhood of the line of contact. The tertiary deposits of the Territory are extensive and widely dis tributed, being found in almost eA-ery portion occupied, from Fort Union to the head-waters of the Missouri. The liguite group, lying about Fort Union, at the eastern limit of the Territory, is 2,000 feet thick, and extends OATer an immense area. This group is tertiary, probably of the eocene age. The same group makes its appearance at different points in the Territory, and at no point is its occurrence more clearly marked than at the head-waters of the Missouri. We may say that the leATel or gently undulating plateaux of all the A'alleys aboA*e the confluence of the Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin riA*ers are underlaid by lignite or other beds of the same age. They are made up of deposits of sand, clay, and friable sandstone, with beds of lignite, gypsum, fire-clay, &c. In some localities fossil trees are found in abundance; as, for instance, in the tertiary near Gallatin. Silica is the fossilizing agent. If we examine the present conformation of this portion of the Terri tory we shall readily discover the origin of the tertiary seas in which these deposits Avere formed. We find the mingled waters of the Jeffer son, Madison, and Gallatin sweeping through an abrupt caiion, where once au uninterrupted rocky barrier Avas presented to the northward flow of these waters. This caused the Avater to OA'erflow all the com paratively leA*el land south and west of the present \" forks\" of the Mis souri, forming an extensiA'e inland sea, Avhich was afterward drained by the cutting through of the present canon. At the same epoch the dif ferent canons on the upper waters of the same streams and their tribu taries were also closed, causing the existence of other and smaller inland seas. The beautiful valley of the Madison river was then one magnificent sheet of water, extending from the mouth of the present caiion south ward as far as the eye could reach, aud even far up on the very sources of the Missouri ; as, for instance, aboA*e the caiion at Baunock smaller tertiary seas existed. Beneath these seas the lignite clays and soft sandstone of the present valleys Avere formed during the lapse of ter tiary age. The Madison Aralley, with its broad and beautiful plateaux, underlaid by undisturbed tertiary deposits, is perhaps the best illustration of the formation of this age in the Territory. Though as yet undeveloped, the lignites of this formation are doubt less destined to furnish fuel in sufficient abundance to meet the require ments of the Territory. j A bed of lignite has been worked to a slight extent near Bannock with fair promise, it is said, of success. Beds have been discovered in various points of the Territory, and the coal rudely tested with varied results. As in other sections, we shall doubtless find many of the lig nite seams unfit for use; but, long before the forests fail to furnish a supply of fuel, A*eins of good lignite will doubtless be developed in dif ferent parts of the Territory. From the tertiary beds above Bannock, gypsum may be obtained in"], [150, "138 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES large quantities, and probably from similar beds in other valleys. The clays of some of these beds are of a very refractory character, and are destined to furnish material for the construction of smelting furnaces, &c. CHAPTER XIII. POPULATION, ASSESSMENTS, IMPORTATIONS, AVAGES, COST OF MATERIAL, CHINESE, PACIFIC RAILROAD, ETC. Population. \u2014 The present year has been a period of A-ery general pros perity. Emigration from tlie Territory is far less observable than last fall. Farming has become a settled pursuit. The quartz mines are building up around them permanent towns, and families are becoming more common in the community. For the above reasons it is probable that the population has increased to somewhat over 28,000 souls, not including the Indians.

Latterly, owing to the close of navigation on the Missouri, and the near approach to Salt Lake of the Union Pacific railroad, small lots of the more A*aluable goods haAre been shipped hither by car and wagon. During the summer many pack trains cross the mountains from Oregon, bringing clothing, blankets, and similar goods from the Pacific slope. I think it would not be out ofthe way to put the amount of imported freights at a grand total of 6,000 tous for the entire country. Labor. \u2014 In order to a correct conclusion in regard to the relations of labor and capital, as expressed in the term Avages, we must bear in mind the general principle that, Avhere capital is abundant, interest is low and labor likewise ; on the other hand where capital is scarce interest is high and labor likewise. In the first case the laborer is, so to speak, at the mercy of capital ; in the latter he is free and independent. In all long settled countries we find examples of the first condition, and in all new countries of the second. And it is to escape this pressure, or supposed pressure, that our American population, or at least the discontented and ambitious portion, seeks the frontier where capital is scarce, and the remuneration of the laborer high. Montana, with the other new Territories, and the older States to the east, exemplify the aboA*e enunciated proposition. The price of labor here, as elsewhere, is gOA*erned by the general law of supply and demand. Wages reach their maximum in summer, and minimum in winter ; and for the folloAving reasons: During part of the spring, summer, and early fall, the placers offer a ready field for labor, and wages are, conse- quently, at their height. The price Araries from $2 50 to $8 (gold dust) per day, equal to $3 to $10 currency; the last figure being the excep- tional remuneration of first class \" drifters.\" It is quite improbable that less than the former price will be paid for many years to come, for the simple reason that there are still thousands of acres AA'hereon a man may, by his own unaided labor, obtain that amount as a daily minimum. Indeed, such placers are denominated by the miners \" China diggings,\" _. e., fit only for the Chinese, and are now passed by without a second thought. The average miner of all the new Territories is far superior, both in natural intelligence and acquired knowledge, to the laborers of the older States. He requires a large income, and, owing to a chronic habit of improA*idence, is often in actual want. In ordinary years the placer miner can count upon eight months, during which the streams are not frozen, and hence he must earn enough during two-thirds of the year to support him during a twehTemonth. Amongst the entire population of the mining Territories there is, in reality, no laboring class. The man who gives his services for hire to-day"], [152, "140 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES may be the employer to-morrow ; and it is this uncertainty of fortune which insures mutual consideration, self-respect, and a spirit of inde pendence. Such as are unwilling to work in the placers find employment, during the summer, iu haymaking and general farm labor. The usual rate of wages for such labor is $60, currency, per month and board. Teamsters receive $40 to $50, currency, per month aud board. During the winter season placer mining is impossible, or at best the miner can only hoist the pay gravel to the surface, so as to be ready for the spring washing. Hence a large number of men are thrown out of employment, and many who, through ill fortune or improvidence, have not sufficient funds to bridge over the winter, must perforce seek a living otherwise. This state of affairs conduces greatly to the advantage of the quartz claims, and good miners are readily attainable at rates varying from $40 to $60, currency, per month, aud board. Prudent managers often extract, during the winter, ore in sufficient quantity to keep their mills employed far into the summer, so that the major portion of the hands may, with the opening spring, be released to work in the placers. Good carpenters and machinists receive $6 to $8 per day ; boiler makers and master builders often as high as $12 to $15 per day. Employment of all kinds is remunerated far in excess of the simple cost of living ; the uncertainty, however, of steady occupation, not only renders these high prices neces sary, but still further tends to unsettle the laborer. In cases Avhere hands are employed under an agreement that board be furnished them, it is usual to rate this outlay as equivalent to an addition to the wages of $1, currency, per day. In the towns the cost of liA'ing is much greater ; ordinary board, without lodging, varies from $12 to $18, currency, per week. With every season, however, we find a gradual diminution in the cost of the necessaries of life. The Territory is, as concerns agricultural pro ducts, very nearly self-supporting; and as the farmers cannot rely upon any other than the home market, their increasing production will year by year lower the cost of living. Good flour now ranges from $8 to $15 per sack of 100 pounds; whereas formerly it often cost from $50 to $120 for a like amount. Potatoes haA*e fallen from 80 cents to 2 cents per pound; barley and Avheat from 30 cents to 6 cents per pound. Cost of materials. \u2014 Sawed lumber costs from $25 to $50 per thousand ; cord Avood from $4 to $8 per cord ; brick from $30 to $35 per thousand; charcoal, 20 to 35 cents per bushel. Chinese. \u2014 This people are but just now beginning to form an appreci able proportion of the population. I estimate their number at about 800, of whom two-thirds are engaged in washing OA*er the placers abandoned by the whites; the remaining third find employment as washers and ironers, as cooks, aud keepers of small shops. As a class iu the community, they are quiet, orderly aud peaceable. Their mutual quarrels seldom or never require the arbitrament of the courts, and during the past year there has been among them but one arrest and conviction, on a charge of manslaughter. As far as my observation extends, public opinion seems, in regard to this people, to be apathetic and seldom demonstrative either for or against them ; that there exists, however, a latent prejudice against them is highly probable. From time to time, it is true, Ave hear of outrages inflicted upon some one of them in the same manner, and perhaps as fre quently, as dogs or cattle are maltreated. Otherwise they are as free from annoyance as any other class in the community. They do not compete"], [153, "141 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. with the whites, and, when mining, either buy claims, thus acquiring rights which are respected, or take up abandoned ground. I am unac quainted with any locality, either placer or vein mine, where the Chinese are hired by the whites. Northern Pacific railroad. \u2014 The question as to the most feasible route for the construction of the proposed Northern Pacific railroad is one of vital importance in its bearing upon the interests of the Territory. Hitherto the cost of transportation of machinery and supplies, and the uncertainty attending their transit either by the plains or by river, has been a most serious obstacle to the success of all enterprises in the Terri tory, especially those connected with mining operations. Some of the larger stamp mills of the Territory were freighted across the plains, at an expense of 37 cents per pound, and the first outlay for freight, in many cases, has been so great as to dishearten the proprietors, and stop the further prosecution of the enterprise. Freights by river have not, of late, been extravagantly high, but the uncertainty attending river navi gation makes it very desirable, and in the end will make it imperatively necessary, that some more rapid and reliable mode of transportation be adopted. This wdl doubtless be effected eventually by the construction of the proposed Northern Pacific road; but in the interval of delay aris ing from the want of aid from a government already heavily burdened, it is hoped that a branch connection with the present Union Pacific may be constructed to meet the present wants of the inhabitants. In this connection the following letter from Captain W. W. De Lacy \u2014 who, from his ability as an engineer, as well as his long experience in the Territory, is entitled to the confidence of all \u2014 will give reliable data as to the more practicable routes for each of these roads. Dear Sir: In answer to your inquiries as to the most desirable routes for the Northern Pacific, and the proposed branch to connect with the Union Pacific roads, I make the fol lowing statements : I will take as the basis of my remarks the line laid down on the map which accompanies the report of Edwin F. Johnson, esq., chief engineer of the Northern Pacific railroad, dated November, 1867. This map, in all essential points, is very correct. The line of the projected railroad is represented as crossing the Yellowstone river at Onahtaroup (or Coal) creek, going up the river some distance ; thence crossing lo the head of the Musselshell river ; thence down Deep creek to its mouth on the Missouri river ; thence crossing the Rocky mountains at Lewis and Clarke's, or Cadotte's Pass, both on the head of the Dearborn river ; thence proceeding down the Big Blackfoot to the Hellgate, and thence down the Clarke's Fork of the Columbia, where it passes without the boundaries of the Territory. I would remark, briefly, that I am personally acquainted with almost the whole of this route, except the extensive eastern sec tion on the Yellowstone river, aud that it is remarkably favorable for a railroad. There are no heavy mountains between tbe Yellowstone and Musselshell, the country partaking rather of a high rolling plateau. There is a very low open pass at the head of the Musselshell river, and the passes of the Rocky mountains are not above 6,500 feet high. The approach to these passes is not generally difficult, and timber of fine quality, (chiefly pine,; water, and fine bnilding-stone, abound. There is another route which would go down the Yellowstone to the Big Bend, cross over by Ihe Boseman Pass to the Three Forks of the Missouri river ; thence up the Jefferson to the Big Hole, or Wisdom river, cross the Rocky mountains at the Deer Lodge Pass, which is about two miles wide, and thence down the Deer Lodge and Hellgate rivers to the mouth ofthe Big Blackfoot, where it would intersect the line previously spoken of This route would be longer than the one by the head of the Musselshell, and longer than that north of the Missouri surveyed by Governor Stevens ; but it would have the advai.tage of passing through some of the finest agricultural valleys of the Territories ; also through some of the richest mineral districts. The difficulties of construction would be less, and the grades easier, than on any other route with which I am acquainted. Coal has been found in many places on or near both of the lines spoken of, such as on the Yellowstone, in several places, the Musselshell river, aud also the Judith at Boseman's Pass, and on the Dearborn. These deposits are more properly lignites. Two of them have been tried ; one of them, at Bose man's Pass, in making gas, and the other at the Dearborn, iu a grate. Both succeeded well. I have been informed that the lignites from the neighborhood of Mount Diablo, in California, are used with success on board the coast steamers. There is a great deal of excellent laud along the Yellowstone, and on the large tributaries"], [154, "142 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES emptying into it from the south, such as the Powder, Tongue, Rosebud, Big Horn, Clarke's Fork, and many smaller streams. To the north are the valleys of the Musselshell, Judith, Deep creek, and Missouri. In western Montana the road would pass through mineral dis- tricts of known richness. In eastern Montana the country, in consequence of the hostility of the Indians, has not been very thoroughly prospected ; but enough has been done to prove that the country is rich in the precious metals. As the questions of climate and depth of snow have a very important bearing on the practicability of the road, I will simply give the gen- eral results of years of travel and observation iu these mountains. During all of these years I have had occasion to travel in one part or another of the country during the winter, and generally on horseback. I would say, therefore, that in open valleys, such as that near Helena, the Deer Lodge valley, &c, the suow seldom becomes deeper than one foot, and that iu deep, narrow gorges, where the sun cannot reach it, or where the timber may be thick, the depth ot snow generally reaches from two to two and a-half feet. In ascending the hills, particu- larly on their no: them slopes, the snow becomes deeper, but I doubt whether, even at the highest summits, it ever reaches the depth of 10 feet, judging by the trees. The southern slopes of the hills, or those opposed to the sun, are generally bare, and horses and cattle there pick up a comfortable subsistence. The winter does not become severe, nor does much snow fall until after the first of Jauuary. During that month there are generally ten days or two weeks when the thermometer ranges from zero to 30\u00b0, and even 40\u00b0 below. The rest of the season is uot generally as severe as in the northern parts of Maine, Vermont, or Massachusetts. I would further add, that once in about 10 or 12 years, according to the observations of old mountaineers, there comes an extraordinary winter, when a much greater quantity of snow falls than usual. Such a one was the winter of 1860-61, when vast num- bers of horses aud cattle perished in consequence of the depth of the snow. This occurs, how- ever, in all northern countries. In further elucidation of the matter I will state that, on the 23d and 24th of December, 1867, I crossed the Belt mountains, east of the Missouri, twice ; once at the head of Confed- erate gulch, and again at the head of the Musselshell river, and returned about the lst of Jan- uary. The utmost depth of snow that I found on either summit was about one foot. In going the cold was very severe, but on my return the weather was mild and pleasant. In the spring, on the 13th of March, I crossed the Rocky mountains at what is called the Frenchman's Pass, within about 15 miles of Helena City, finding about two feet of snow on the summit. There was no snow in the valleys on either side, aud but little on the side hills. I passed the range 10 days after at Mullan's Pass, and found but little snovv, the ground being bare in many places. You ask, \" What Hue would be best for a railroad connecting with the Union Pacific?\" This question does not state what point is intended to be connected, but, as Helena is now the commercial center of the Territory, I will take it for granted it is meant as the objective point. I would state, therefore, in my opinion, the shortest and best line could be obtained by starring from the crossing of Green river, following up the stream or some of its branches to the head of either Salt river or John Gray's river (branches of the South Snake river) to the junction with that river, which takes place where that stream turns from north to southwest j thence the road could go up the South Snake, (in a northerly course, ) to the large lake at its head, could cross the mountains there and follow down the south branch of the Madison, arrd the Madison itself, to the three forks of the Missouri ; down the Missouri and up Ten- mile creek to Helena The general direction of this route is a little west of north. The length would be about 350 miles ; and it offers the most direct and practicable solution of the problem that I know of. There is a portion of this route that I am not personally acquainted with. I know nothing of Green river, or of the heads of Salt river, or John Gray's river, but I am well acquainted with the South Snake river, which I explored frem its mouth to its head in 1863, and with the Madison, Missouri, and neighborhood of Helena, and these present no serious difficulties. The worst part would be at the bend of the South Snake river, where it turns at right angles to its former course. Here there is a precipitous canon, which lasts for several miles. There is au Indian trail on the western side, that being more favorable than its opposite. Above this point there is one other canon, not nearly as difficult as this one, and the rest ot the way is comparatively easy. The river heads in a large lake some 12 or 15 miles long, and flows into another large lake called Jackson's lake, of about the same length. At the bead of the South Snake, and also on the south fork of the Madison, there are hundreds of hot springs, many of which are \"geysers.\" There are two large prairies, or \" holes,\" in mountain parlance, on the South Snake, which could be culrivated. The whole country is remarkably well watered, aud abounds in timber. The nrineral indications are. numerous, and I have no douot that, as in tbe adjacent Territo ries, the precious metals will be found. Coal was discovered by the party that I was with. The climate, I think, is not severe. It was then in the first half of October, at which time the weather was very mild, and no snow had fallen. This was at an altitude of 6,000 or 7,000 feet. There is a route still further to the west which would pass down the South Snake"], [155, "143 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. river from the bend to its mouth, and thence turning northerly cross the divide at the head of Red Rock creek, and follow down the Beaver Head below the mouth of Black Tail Deer creek, thence cross over to the Wisdom or Big Hole river, (there are no mountains in the way,) cross the Rocky mountains at the low and open Deer Lodge pass, and proceed down the Deer Lodge river to the Hellgate, the probable location of the prospective Northern Pacific railroad. The most difficult portion of tbe route would be down the South Snake river, which, like the main Snake river, abounds in basaltic precipices. The Rocky mountains, in conse quence of a remarkable turn which they make, would have to be passed twice, but both passes are wide and open, and neither are over 100 feet in altitude. Timber and water abound ou this route. W. W. DE LACY. Professor A. K. Eaton. CHAPTEE XIV. PLACER MINES. Bannack Placers. \u2014 The first placers successfully worked in the territory Avere those of Bannack, discovered in the summer of 1862. The yield was at first large and the gold of high grade, but OAving to want of capital, only those portions of the gulch were worked that did not involve any considerable expenditure. The discovery of Alder gulch, :n July of the folloAving year, immedi ately attracted most of the miners to that point, so that by the spring of 1864 Bannack was almost entirely deserted by the actiA'e placer mining portion of its population. In 1866 it again began to show signs of ac tiA'ity, and has been steadily increasing its productions since. The completion of a long ditch by Smith & Graeter, bringing the waters of the Horse Prairie creek into the gulch, has been the principal occasion of an increase in the yield of the gulch the present year. Enterprising capitalists haAre long looked upon this gulch as exceed ingly rich, especially at certain points, inaccessible except by the expen diture of considerable capital ; and preliminary steps haAre been taken to organize companies for the purpose of Avorking the gulch, or a consid erable portion of it, by a thorough system of hydraulic working and bed rock fluming ; but the difficulty inA'ohed in securing consecutiAe claims, and more especially the inqiossibility of holding the property securely until their arrangements were completed for practically working the claims, have preA'ented the success of these schemes. There is little doubt that the gold hitherto taken from the gulch is but a tithe of that now inaccessible for want of capital, but that capital can not be commanded so long as the statutes do not giA*e ample protection to mining property once acquired, and enable capitalists to hold claims without interference sufficiently long to put a systematic method of mining into actual operation. The same is true of many other localities, where, as in this case, the conformation of the ground and other difficulties involve the necessity of a great expenditure of money, before remunerative returns could be realized. Alder Gulch. \u2014 This gulch, second in point of discoA'ery in the Terri tory, and in yield the first, perhaps, in the Avorld, is still being worked at certain points successfully, but those portions that can be worked profitably by indiA'iduals with limited means are few, and like most of the older diggings it is awaiting the influx of capital. The introduction of water from the headwaters of the Madison riAer has been long contemplated, and a survey of the most practicable course has demonstrated its feasibility, but the great expense of the undertak-"], [156, "144 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES ing\u2014 not less than $75,000\u2014 precludes the probability of its completion at present. Alder Gidch has already yielded a fabulous amount of gold, which it would doubtless duplicate if thoroughly worked by a systematic method of bed-rock fluming aud hydraulics. The successful Avorking of claims at the head of the gulch was some- Avhat interrupted, early in September, by a destructive water spout. Butcher and French gulches Avere deluged Avith water, Avhich, sweeping down through the main gulch, buried flumes, shafts, and machinery beneath amass of sand, gravel and boulders. The effects ofthe tornado, however, rapidly disappeared before the energy of the miners, and prob ably did not seriously affect the yield of the gulch for the present season ; these Avater spouts, though not usual, may be considered as part of the \" institutions\" of the country, as more or less of them are experienced every year. The introduction of the waters of the Madison would doubtless restore to Alder gulch its former activity and profitableness. Wigwam, a gulch tributary to Alder, is reported to haATe yielded largely. Rain's Horn, an old gulch north of Virginia City, and according to com mon report worked out, has given rise to considerable excitement, based upon the report that valuable deposits have been uncovered beneath the old bed rock flume. The Radersbury and Crow Creek diggings, 45 miles east of Helena, have yielded moderately. Last Chance gulch, one of the most remarkable in the Territory, still con tinues to be successfully worked, and at some points more profitably than ever. This is especially true of the exterior deposits of pay graATel beloAv the town of Helena ; the claims, for instance, of Taylor, Thomson & Company. In the summer of 1865 these claims were worked only to the depth of a few feet, by stripping the surface to the \u25a0\u25a0 pay streak ;\" it was then supposed that the ground below would not pay. They are now working the deposits to the depth of from 40 to 50 feet, Avith very remunerative results. The success of operations at this locality has induced parties to search for similar deposits at a point further below the town. On the slope of Ten-mile creek, below Helena, a number of shafts have been sunk in search of the supposed continuation ofthe A*aluable deposit brought to light in the claims of Taylor, Thomson & Company, Getchell & Company, &c, in Last Chance gulch. In the confident belief that such a channel really exists, Colonel Kieler and his associates have com menced a deep drain near the Jewish cemetery on Ten-mile creek. Their ditch has already been dug a distance of 1,500 feet, and a large volume of water has been struck in it. The majority ofthe gulches in the vicinity of Helena have been worked more or less steadily and productively. Silver creek, Trinity, and Pie gan to the north, have yielded moderately well. In Ten-mile creek, to the west of Helena, a prospecting company has been formed to test the bed of the gulch, which is believed to be rich. A deep shaft has been sunk and a Woodworth pump capable of raising some hundreds of gallons per minute has been put in. The prospects are reported to be encouraging. The more economically directed claims in Last Chance expend, on the average, 50 per cent, of the gross yield for running expenses ; the others about 75 per cent. The chief item of outlay is the payment of water money, viz r 50 cents per inch miner's measurement, i. e., for such a volume of water as is dis charged through an orifice one inch square, under a six-inch pressure."], [157, "145 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. Originally but little water flowed down Last Chance. To supply this want a long line of ditches AA*as constructed by Messrs. Truett, Dahler and Atchison. Through the flumes and ditches built by these gentle men several thousand inches of water have been brought in from Ten mile creek. Should a bed-rock flume be budt through the gulch, this water may be at once turned on ; whereby it will be possible to rework not only the great heaps of tailings already washed once, but also to extract the1 gold from a considerable stretch of ground too poor to return a profit under present conditions. The early spring and summer have not been marked by any general exodus nor stampede. Momentary excitements, so to speak, have been caused by the boulder gulches, known as Peter's, Galena, and Boom erang, Avhich haA*e yielded nothing or only moderately. More recently, Basin gulch, 35 miles west of Jeffersou City, Wilson gulch, 10 miles east of the same toAvn, and Tyser gulch, still further to the southeast, have enlisted some attention, and each, with the coming season, bids fair to be reasonably productiATe. To the east of the Missouri river, 16 miles by trail and 26 miles by coach-road from Diamond City, lies Thomson gulch ; here three hydraulics haA*e been running successfully on Morgan bar, beloAv Eagle City. The Deep creek country, in the same vicinity, lying between Diamond City and the Musselshell, has during the summer attracted some attention. The diggings are A*ery extensiA*e, but only moderately rich. Amongst the older and well-known gulches to the east of the Rocky mountains, seATeral have produced far more gold than last year ; as an example we may cite the claims of Colonel Head & Company, in Con federate gulch. This gulch, it Avill be remembered, is the locality where, two seasons ago, the gold dust .was collected by the hundred- weight ; its product this year, from Montana bar especially, will almost equal the highest yield of the past. Messrs. King and Gillette, of Helena, have constructed in Confederate gulch a bed rock flume uearly a half a mile in length. The major por tion of the present season haA'ing been consumed iu the work, it cannot be expected to yield largely until the coming summer. At El Dorado bar on the Missouri riA*er, a locality prolific of fine sapphires, there has recently been completed a long ditch, which was carried over Loup creek through a lofty flume. The bar has not this season turned out as faA'orably as had been antici pated. There is, howeArer, reason to hope that better results will be obtained during the next summer. West of the main range of the Rocky mountains, the placers have, on the average, been far more productive than during the last year. The older gulches \u2014 Blackfoot, Confederate bar, German gulch, Elk, Bear, and Lincoln gulches \u2014 have been worked steadily, and many of them yielded largely. Of particularly flattering yields we may instance the placers of Silver Bin and vicinity, and of Gold creek and its neighborhood, famous as the locality where gold was first discovered in the Territory. Among the recent developments Ave may mention Uncle Ben's gulch, 20 miles south west of Deer Lodge City, discoATered during the past summer, and reported to be yielding satisfactorily. Pioneer gulch, some three miles distant from Gold creek, likewise yielding Avell. Prairie Diggings, like- Avise southwest of Silver Bin ; Henderson, near Emmetsburg, and Haiwey creek, 18 miles above, have all paid moderately. Modesty and Last creeks, to the east of Deer Lodge City, have attracted some notice. H. Ex. Doc. 54 10"], [158, "146 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES But one \" stampede\" of any magnitude is to be chronicled west of the range. This was caused by a report of fabulously rich diggings in the Clear Water country, in the C\u0153ur D'Alene range. These placers are situated some 45 mdes southeast of the famous Florence, in Idaho. Quite a number of stampeders started thither, but the tide turned, and little has since been heard of the locality. It is reported that 40 men Avill winter there, so that the country will be thoroughly prospected the coming summer. In general terms, it may stated that the placers of the entire Territory have yielded, on the average, fully 20 per cent, more than last year. Confederate, Silver Bin, and German gulches excepted, Ave find a less number of brilliant individual yields, but as an offset we have had a more general well-doing. Among the best indications of uniform prosperity is the fact that but few stampedes have taken place. This gives the assurance that the miners generally ha\\Te accepted the conclusion that ordinary paying placers near home are far preferable to diggings at a distance, whose only ey^idence of value is common report. Again, the search for deep placers, similar to the Blue lead of California, has already begun. Should the iiwestigations beloAv Helena prove successful, they Avill unearth a species of placers Avhich will be prolific for years. Montana is pre-eminently a \"wash\" country, and it is impossible to resist the conclusion that the, secondary outflows have coATered up, to a great depth, diggings far richer than any heretofore discoA*ered on or near the surface. The importance of such diggings will be better appreciated from a statement of the fact that two-thirds of the gross gold product of Cali fornia is due to the deep placers. It is improbable, howeArer, that we shall find in Montana any layTa-coArered localities similar to the Tuolumne table mountain. CHAPTER XV. QUARTZ MINES. The product of bullion from the quartz lodes of the Territory, though small compared to that of the placer mines, shows a A7ery great increase over that of any preA'ious year from the same source. Hitherto, through lack of systematic deArelopment, the mines haA*e not generally furnished ore iu sufficient quantity to keep the mills continually supplied. This difficulty is fast being obviated and many mills are running uninter uptedly, and with the most satisfactory results. One element of success of late has been the enlistment of home capital. The prominent business men of the Territory \u2014 merchants, bankers, &c. \u2014 haAre been of late engag ing in quartz mining enterprises, and their confidence has been rewarded by success. The increased facilities for the manufacture and repairs of mining machinery have also contributed not a little to this great produc tion of bullion from quartz. The Unionville mines. \u2014 The quartz lodes of Unionville, four miles south of Helena, are first in point of interest in the Territory, since they are the most thoroughly developed, and haAre produced at least one-half of the Avhole gross gold product from quartz during the last year. This statement applies more particularly to the property known as the Whit latch Union Arein, which is owned and worked by seA^eral different com panies. Of them the National Mining and Exploring Company was the first in the field and has been the most successful. The lode has a general course, accepting the angle given by the United States deputy mineral land surveyor, Captain DeLacy, of south 84\u00b0 24' east. It was"], [159, "147 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. discoA-ered in the winter of 1864, and work was actively begun the ensu ing spring. The country rock is granite and the lode is found a short distance south of a wide belt of limestone. In width the vein varies from 20 inches to 11 feet and upAvards, halving, in the better portions of the pay chimney, an aA^erage Avidth of five to six feet. The gangue is quartzy in the superior portions, and below seems to assume the character of a quartziferous syenite. The minor minerals in the vein are iron pyrites, increasing as the excavation extends ; telluret of gold in con siderable quantity; copper pyrites in small amounts and occasional markings of carbonate and silicate of copper. Crystals of hornblende are now and then found with adhering particles of uatiye gold. The ownerships on the lode, commencing at the Discovery claim, are as follows : DiscoyTery, owned by Whitlatch Union Mining Company. No. 1 east, owned by Whitlatch Union Mining Company. West half No. 2 east, OAvned by Whitlatch Union Mining Company. East half No. 2 east, o*wned by Mansfield and Hodsou. No. 3 east, owned by Columbia Mining Company. No. 4 east, OAvned by Columbia Mining Company and Mansfield and Hodson. No. 5 east, OAvned by Whitlatch Union Mining Company. No. 1 west, owned by I X L Mining Company. No. 2 west, owned by National Mining and Exploring Company. No. 3 west, OAvned by Columbia Mining Company. No. 4 west, OAvned by National Mining and Exploring Company. East half No. 5 west, owned by National Mining and Exploring Com- pany. West half No. 5 west, in dispute. No. 6 west, (called also Owyhee,) owned by Parkison and Whitlatch. No. 7 west, (called also Owyhee,) OAvned by Parkison .and Whitlatch. Remaining claims on Owhyee owned by Parkison. The depths reached on the lode are as follows : On Discoy*ery claim, 200 feet. On I X L claim, 380 feet. On National Mining and Exploring Company claim, 345 feet. On Columbia Mining Company claim, 340 feet. On Parkison and Whitlatch claim, 130 feet. The w*orking of the y*arious claims on this lode have built up and' maintained a considerable Aillage. The employes and people directly or indirectly dependent on the mines number between 800 and 1,000 souls. The vein has giAren employment to three proprietary mills, aggre gating 74 stamps, and occasionally to two custom mills of 10 stamps each. The former have been in operation almost uninterruptedly, ami have produced a A*ery large sum total in gold bullion. The average yield of the ore cannot have been far short of $20 to $25 coin per ton of 2,000 pounds. The highest yield from any portion of the mine consisted of an average of $80 coin per ton from 300 tons of selected ore. The vein near the surface is quite irregular ; runs flat in many places,. but in depth seems inclined to keep a more constant dip. It is possible that these variations may continue until the limestone belt be reached,. from Avhence the vein would, in all probabdity, follow the line of demar cation between the two rocks. In the lowest levels the water-line has been reached, and it is pro posed to put in three pumps some time during the coming spring."], [160, "148 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES Connections have been made on the vein a distance of 1,300 feet, thus facilitating ventilation. Towards the Avest the supposed continuation of the Union has received the name of the Park lode. It differs from the Union in so far as larger masses of iron and copper pyrites are found near the surface. This ore is in such abundance that it is advisable to erect chlorination Avorks for its reduction. A number of shafts have been sunk aud are now sinking on the lode. The books of one of the companies working the ores of the Union lode show the receipts during the year ending October 31, 1868, of $136,900. As they work about 600 tons of ore per month, these receipts indicate an average yield of $19 per ton. The cost of mining and milling these ores varies, according to different statistics, from $7 50 to $12 per toii. The Laramie mines. \u2014 The lodes of the Laramie district, south of Vir ginia City, have proved difficult of development ; aud most of the mills have been idle much of the year for a want of a supply of quartz. They have recently shown increased activity ; and there is little doubt that the district will eventually prove one of the best in the Territory. The gold of this district is, much of it, of very high grade, and occurs in pockets of great richness. The irregularity of the deposits, however, is the occasion of great discouragement; and the difficulties of development are greatly enhanced by the fact that the valuable lodes are owned by many different parties, one owning 100 feet, another 50 feet, &c, making the risk and expense of deArelopment too great for any one of the various owners. This difficulty will correct itself in time, by means of combina tions that will secure systematic deA*elopment. The Bannock mines. \u2014 The mines in the vicinity of Bannock have been worked most of the year, but not Avith sufficient success to furnish a full supply of ore to the mills erected. The mill of the Mineral Land Min ing Company has crushed the ores of the Dakota lode as fast as mined, but has probably run but two or three months during the year. A small mill in the vicinity has been running most of the time, princi pally upon ores from the Cherokee lode. From the Dakota about 1,200 tous only haA*e been crushed during the last year, yielding an average of $18 per ton. The difficulties connected Avith the deA*elopment of the Dakota arise in part from the character of the Arein, and in part from diyrided owner ship and disputed titles. The Dakota, like all the auriferous \\Teins about Baunock, is a contact vein lying between the dioritic trap, or gran ite, as the miners term it, and limestone veins of this kind, which con form to the broken outlines of a disrupted formation, are, of neces sity, very irregular, especially near the surface ; hence the eATer-Ararying character of the Dakota. The trappean mass, in connection with which the Dakota A*ein occurs, lies in a kind of irregular circle in that part of the canon, and all the indications of gold in A*eins are upon the outer limits of this mass. The Hot Spring mines. \u2014 The mines of the Hot Spring, or Sterling, dis trict have not, as yet, proved remunerative. Five mills yvere erected, but, iu all cases, preAious to any considerable development of the lodes upon Avhich the hopes of the proprietors were based. One mill, that of the New York and Montana M. & D. Company, has been running with little interruption during the last summer and fall. The ores of the district, i. e., those Avorked, aA*erage probably about the same as in other portions of the Territory \u2014 from $18 to $20 person. The gold, \u2022with few exceptions, is of Ioav grade throughout the district, ranging"], [161, "149 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. from j5^y\u00b0o to J^l fine. This increases materially the difficulty of amal gamation. Perhaps no district in the Territory showed stronger indications of rich auriferous deposits than this when first examined. The veius are numer ous, but many are small, and all irregular at the present stage of devel opment, Deeper workings will doubtless secure greater uniformity. The veins in the upper district lie wholly in granite ; those of the lower, in gneiss. The lower district has of late appeared the most promising. Rochester Gulch and Silver Star district. \u2014 The Woodworth and Hen drie mill at Eochester, finished in June last, has run uninterruptedly, and with large profit. The mill has ten stamps. The total expenditure up to the time of starting the stamps is reported to have been $34,000. Of this amount, $6,700 is charged to the mine, and $1,500 for the pur chase of teams. The total running outlay is stated to be $560 per week. Within nine weeks after the mill was fairly in operation there was reported a yield of $15,286. The gross yield ranged from 110 ounces to 136 ounces per week. The gold is of a low grade, being largely made up of silver. Further exploration is necessary in order to determine whether the gold or silver will ultimately predominate. Encouraged by the suc cess of Captain Hendrie, several additional mills are in contemplation in the same district ; that of Mr. Warren is reported to be nearly com pleted. At Silver Star, near the Jefferson, we hear of two successful enterprises, viz : the Everett mill of 10 stamps, to work the ores of the Green Campbell lode, and the Stevens & Turitt mill of 12 stamps, to work the ore of the Iron Eod lode ; both are reported to be yielding well. The mills in the New York gulch, east of the Missouri, are all at a stand-still ; also the Allen mill on Ten-mile. It is in contemplation to erect near Diamond the mid of an Indiana company, formerly standing in Clark's gulch, near Helena. In the Blue Cloud district, west of Helena, there are two mdls, one in successful operation, and a second in progress of erection. A 30-stamp mill is on its way from Fort Benton, which will probably be erected the coming spring on Mitchell's or McClellan's gidch, some 12 miles east of Helena. West of the main range of the Eocky mountains, we have the mill of Prof. Swallow, at Highland, of 24 stamps. It has recently started up, and is reported to have made a successful run. The mill of the St. Louis and Montana Mining Company, at Philips burg, the only silver amalgamation mill in the Territory, has been run ning more or less constantly the entire year. Two mills have been erected at Georgetown, 12 miles from Philips burg, for gold ores ; they started, and stopped for reasons unknown. At Cable City, two miles further on, two mills have been built ; the one to work the ores of the Atlantic Cable mine, and the other that of the Thomas lode. Both, and particularly the former, have been crushing successfully. The Atlantic cable lode seems to be an enormous limestone dike, inter calated between granite walls. And in the limestone are found bands and bunches of ore, often of great extent and value. The ore consists of some quartz, carbonate of copper, copper pyrites, and a very large amount black and reddish oxides of iron."], [162, "RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES 150 Table of quartz mills. In addition to the above-mentioned, there are in the Territory between 40 and 60 stamps which will be erected the coming spring, or as soon as the developments on the respective leads shall warrant. Further, there are some 20 odd stamps erected in different localities, which have re turned no profit, and which are now standing idle. We may estimate the total number of stamps erected in the Territory at about 500. Of these not more than 150 were kept more or less regu larly in operation at the beginning of the year. In the month of July the gold interest began to yield brilliantly, and the number of stamps running, including those of new aud old mills, could not have been less than 225. At present it is fair to estimate that 275 stamps are working successfully. The failures aud disastrous results of the past have yielded an amount of experience by which like errors may be avoided in the future. The principle is beginning to be understood that the mine should be opened before a miU be erected, and that the costs, and not the profits, should form the basis on which to make an estimate. Ten stamps for gold ores may be erected at a cost of $2,000 to $2,500 per stamp. A yield of $15 to $18 (coin) in free gold, per ton of 2,000 pounds will, at present prices of labor and materials, pay from 20 to 50 per cent, profit, according to the amount crushed and favorable or unfa vorable general conditions. The silver amalgamating mill of the St. Louis and Montana Mining Company, of Philipsburg, is reported to reduce the ores of Flint creek for $30 in silver bullion per ton. Smelting furnaces. \u2014 The earliest discoveries of ore at Argenta, in Beaver Head county, were of such a character as to admit of reduction only by the process of smelting ; a small furnace was erected at Ban nock and a large double German cupola at Argenta.

A smaller furnace was subsequently built iu the same town, under the direction of Mr. Romps, an accomplished German metallurgist. Accord ing to common report, the furnace ran to a profit. For reasons, how eyTer, unknown to the public, the works passed into second hands and were closed for some time. Recently it is reported that this furnace is again in operation. Smelting operations, excepting only an experimental furnace erected at Butte City to reduce the surface carbonates of copper, have been confined to the mines of the eastern slopes of the main range. Relying upon the best information at our disposal, there are noAv in the Territory the following smelting works : One furnace, situated one mile above Bannock, to smelt ores from the Blue Wing district ; at Argenta, four furnaces, viz : that erected by the St. Louis and Montana Mining Company ; the Esler furnace ; a furnace built by Messrs. Tootle, Leach & Co., and one erected by A. Murray, esq. Proceeding northyvards, we find one furnace at Mill Creek, north of Virginia City ; aud still further north, at Jefferson City, we find two furnaces ; the one built by the O. M. G. & S. Co., and the other owned by Mr. Rutan. It is claimed that the last mentioned has run to a profit. There is reported a second furnace in process of erection at Butte City, west of the mountains. Smelting is, beyond question, a process whereby a larger percentage of the contained gold and silArer can be extracted than by the amalga mation. It differs from amalgamation in so far that amalgamable ores may be smelted, whereas lead-bearing smelting ores cannot be amalga mated. Copper-bearing ores, it is true, may either be amalgamated or smelted. The great adATantage of the one process OATer the other is due to the fact that the amalgamation is brought about by machinery, is soon finished, and leaves no by-products to be reworked, unless we con sider as such the pjoitiferous tailings ; smelting, on the other hand, is performed mainly by manual labor and is complicated with a number of by-products which require a reworking. MoreoA^er, there is required a large percentage of lead to collect the silver scattered through the rock and galena ; if the ore itself does not contain a sufficiency of that metal it must be added along with the fluxes. The non-metallic and the A*alueless metallic portion of the ore must be disposed of in the form of a slag, which must be of such a consistency as to admit of an easy sep aration therefrom of the argentiferous lead. If the ore does not itself contain the elements requisite to the formation of a proper slag, such fluxes must be added as will make up the deficiency. Owing to the rarity of finding a single ore combining all these advantages it is usual, in England and on the continent of Europe, where smelting is profitably carried on, to combine the ores of the different mines in such a manner that the A^alueless gangue of the one shall act as a flux to that of the other. In this way smelting is robbed of half its difficulty. Moreover, the mines and smelting works are rarely if ever the property of the same parties. The mine-OAvner raises his ores, dresses them, and sells them to the furnace-owner. In early times both pursuits were combined, but all recent experience teaches that it is far preferable to keep them separate. What is needed to make smelting an attractive and profitable pursuit here in Montana is \u2014 1st, a separation of mine and furnace ownership ; 2d, a market for the lead, which at the present rates of transportation is practically valueless ; 3d, cheap labor, and 4th, the"], [164, "152 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES discovery of a variety of coal susceptible of being coked. At present no other fuel than wood and charcoal can be obtained. The time will most assuredly come when the large amount of smelt ing ores in the Territory caii be reduced to a profit. Some central loca tion will be selected on one of the great rivers and in the vicinity of a coal bed, the blast will be driven by water power, and every unneces sary pair of hands dispensed Avith. Under such conditions smelting will be very profitable ; the country will have been settled, and the pres ent annual home consumption of lead will be increased an hundred fold. Even under present conditions an abundance of reasonably rich ores, water-power, and other natural facilities, combined Avith the strictest economy and prudent management, may realize a small profit. Export of ores. \u2014 Owing to the difficulty of obtaining economically favorable results from the lead aud copper bearing ores of the Territory. small lots have, from time to time, been exported from the Territory to the eastern States and to Europe. Among the lots so shipped may be enumerated 1\u00a3 ton of black copper from the experimental furnace at Butte City. This metal was shipped by Captain Hendrie, of the Helena foundry, and was reported to contain a high percentage of gold. Fur ther, 1,000 pounds of argentiferous galena, from the Ten-mde district, was shipped by Messrs. T. E. and D. G. Tutt, and 20 tons of rich silver ores from the Poor Man's Joy lode, of Phdipsburg, by Mr. Cole Saunders. The costs of shipment may be estimated as follows : $20, currency, per ton to Fort Benton, the head of steamboat navigation on the Missouri river ; $20, currency, per ton to St. Louis, by water, and $10 to $15, cur rency* per ton to the seabord. From thence to foreign ports about $15 currency per ton; making in all a grand total of $65 to $70 currency per ton of 2,000 pounds. Hence ores yielding $100 coined value per ton may be, even at present rates, raised and shipped with a small profit. The tendency of prices in Montana is steadily downward, and as the population becomes more stable aud compact, whereby the costs of labor and of the necessaries of life are diminished, these shipments of ore will increase in Arolume aud will yield a much greater profit. Under such conditions, however, it woidd probably be more advisable to reduce the ores on the spot. Production. \u2014 The production of bullion from Montana for the year 1868, judgiug from the most reliable estimates obtainable, probablv reached $15,000,000, of which about $1,000,000 Avas the product of the quartz mines. The amount of silver produced was about $100,000. CHAPTER XVI. REMARKS ON THE OPERATION IN MONTANA OF THE UNITED STATES MINERAL LAND ACT OF JULY 26, 1866, BY W. S. KEYES, MINING ENGINEER, HELENA.* In order to have a clear understanding of the provisions of this law, as applied to Montana, it is necessary to bear in mind the territorial enact ments governing the location and tenure of lode claims. These were two, as follows : The first, consisting of 12 sections, entitled \"An act relating to the discovery of gold and silver quartz leads, lodes, or ledges, and of the manner of their location,\" was approAred December 26, 1864. *I do not entirely agree with Mr. Keyes in his unqualified condemnation of the United States law of 1866. My own opinion will be found in Part II of this report.\u2014 R. W. R."], [165, "153 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. The second became law January 17, 1865. Without repeating here the text of the first law, Avhich is found entire in my report of last year to the United States commissioner of mining, to which reference is made, it Avill suffice to touch upon its peculiarities. This law differs from the local laws aud customs of other mining districts, in so far as only 50 feet are allowed on each side of the respective claims, and each mine is limited in length to 2,200 feet, including discovery claim, and to 200 feet for each name. The second law gives absolute title as against the Territory, and by making the quartz claims a matter of county record, places them upon the same footing as other real property. In Montana, therefore, as compared with other mining regions, we find an anomalous condition of the quartz titles, and the incubus of a rigid, ill-considered, and hastily adopted mining code. The Territory, unlike a concourse of miners, cannot enact retroactiA-e laws, and hence a mistake, ouce made, cannot be remedied, and improA*ement can only be applied to new districts. The mining customs east of the Rocky mountains are very different from those of the west. The latter were colored by the spirit of the Mexican Ordenanzas de Mineria, and took form and substance from the customs of a people accustomed to mines and mining for centuries. The former, born in Colorado and transplanted to Montana, are the product of the crude theories of an agricultural, and not of a mining, people. As a result of these laws I have found much complaint, among such mine owners as have themselves had faith enough to explore their own lodes, fouuded upon the fact that many claims are held totally untouched for y*ears, and by an absentee ownership, which will neither develope nor sell. All these peculiarities combined render the application of the law of 1866 exceedingly unsatisfactory. And, further, in the light of the past two years, and in A*iew of its practical working, at least in Montana, I am constrained to characterize the law a failure. My objections in detail are as follows : lst. It is tedious and A*exatious. 2d. It is excessively costly. 3d. Even the issuance of a patent does not materially diminish the probability of litigation; and 4th. It has brought and can bring but little revenue to the government. First, It is tedious and A*exatious. I can offer no stronger proof under this head than the appended letters of Mr. O. B. O'Bannon, the register of the United States land office, to whom all applications for patent must be made, and of Mr. G. B. Foote, deputy mineral land surveyor. The opinions of each of these gentlemen merit careful attention, and particularly those of Mr. O'Bannon, who, besides having a thorough acquaintance Avith the details of the law, is himself a practical quartz miner of seA eral years' experience in Nevada. I addressed to Mr. O'Ban non the following interrogatories : lst. How many applications for mineral land haA-e been made \"? 2d. How many have beeu contested \"? 3d. How many have been withdrawn ? 4th. How many certificates of final entry have been issued, and for what claims . 5th. How many patents have you received, and for what claims ? 6th. As far as your observation extends, what is your opinion of the practical Avorking of the United States mineral land act of July 26, 1866? 7th. Would patents under this law serve to quiet title and prevent litigation? 8th. What are the defects in the law, and, if any, what remedies would you suggest ?"], [166, "154 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES To all of which Mr. O'Bannon made reply, as follows : United States Land Office, Helena, M. T., November 2], 1868. Dear Sir: Your note of the 12th instant, containing certain interrogatories in regard to the mineral act of July 26, 1866, is before ine. In reply I would state: 1st. That 30 applications for patent under the said act have been made at this office 2d. That seven of these applications have been contested. In two cases the applicants did not appear, and seem to have abandoned their applications. In one case the contestants -withdrew his objections ; and the remaining cases have been referred to the courts ofthe Ter ritory for adjudication. 3d. Six applications have been withdrawn. 4th. Certificates of patent have been issued by me for nine mining claims, to wit: to Whitlatch Union Mining Company, for claims on Union No. 2 lode; to Mclntyre Mining Company, for claims on Mclntyre lode; to James W Whitlatch, for discovery claims ou Park lode; to Turnley Mining Company, for claims on Park lode ; to Ten-mile Mining Com pany, (three certificates,) for claims on Douglas, Roderick Dhu, and Ivanhoe lodes; to Granite Mountain Compauy, for claims on Granite Mountain No. 2 lode ; to Essex Mining Company, for claims on Parkison lode : all situate in Lewis and Clarke county. In the case of the AVhitlatch Union Mining Company, above referred to, the papers were returned from the General Land Office for irregularities, and the application was abandoned by the company. 5th. No patents for mineral lands have ever been received at this office ; and, except in the case of the Whitlatch Union, above referred to, I am not advised of any action at the General Land Office in regard to any of the mineral applications forwarded from this office. 6th. The \" practical working \" of the act in question, so far as I can judge, has from various causes, some of them general and some purely local, not been satisfactory. This mineral act seems to have been gotten up with direct and special reference \"to the rules and customs ofthe miners \" of California and Nevada. Here there are, strictly speak ing, no local rules and customs relating to quartz or \"* lode :' property. The whole matter is regulated by the territorial legislature, and the act of the legislative assembly of the Territory ot Montana, entitled \" An act relating to the discovery of gold and silver quartz lodes, leads, or ledges, and the manner of their location\" approved December 26, 1864, is universally recognized by the miners of the Territory. This act differs in many essential particulars from the mining rules and customs which obtain on the Pacific coast, and which form the basis of the act of Congress of July 26, 1866. Many of the difficulties encountered by appli cants for patent to mineral lands in this Territory arise from this fact. Among other serious obstacles and drawbacks, I would enumerate the inadequacy of the compensation allowed to the deputy surveyors of mineral lands, and the requirement that the estimated cost of survey and publication of notice shall be placed by the applicant in a government depository \" in favor of the United States Treasurer, to be passed to the credit of the fuud created by individual depositors for suiveys of the public lauds.\" This latter has been a peculiar, and, it seems to me, unnecessary hardship in this region so remote from the seat of government ; as an evidence of which I cite the fact that much ofthe money thus deposited has lain idle in the vaults for nearly a year before it was paid over to the deputy surveyors and publishers to whom it rightfully belonged. I see no reason why it might not be so arranged that deputy surveyors could be paid as soon as their services are rendered, or why applicants might not be permitted to make their own terms with publishers. Without further particularizing, I would state generally, under this head, that proceedings under this law here are tedious, vexatious, and expensive ; that miners seeking patents have gen erally become discouraged, and that mineral applications have well nigh ceased at this office. Commissioner Wilson, judging from some of his recent rulings, seems disposed to relieve the law of its harsher features, so far as this can be done, by the most liberal construction of its provisions : and even if some of the details of the law are not modified by Congress, I doubt not that proceedings under it will eventually be greatly simplified by the Commissioner, and the attainment of mineral patents rendered reasonably certain to all meritorious applicants, even in Montana. 7th. So far as I am able to judge it is not the wish of any considerable portion of the mining population of the country that government should dispose of any large part of its lauds con taining precious metals ; and there is nothing the miners would probably ask in relation thereto, except to have an assurance from government that they should be permitted to hold undisturbed such titles as they now enjoy, and that the paramount title of government to such lands should never be enforced. But conceding the point, so stoutly contested by the miners, that it is the true policy of the general government to dispose of all its mineral lands, I must say, after considerable reflection upon the subject, that, aside from the very trifling revenue which would accrue to the government therefrom, I cannot see how matters can be materially improved by the final disposition of the whole, or any large part of them, under the act of July 26, 1866. If the precious metals were always found in regular and well defined veins, which, after the expenditure thereon of labor of the value of \u00a71,000, could always be traced with tolerable"], [167, "AVEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 155 certainty for a distance of 3,000 feet; if there were no \"faults,\" or bifurcations, or short curves, or sharp angles, I should grant that patents under this law would have the effect of quieting title, and ordinarily prove a sufficient safeguard and protection to the patentees. But my observation is that auriferous, argentiferous, or copper-bearing veins, that are regular and well defined, and which, after the expenditure of $1,000 in development, can be traced with any degree of accuracy for a distance of 3,000, or even 1,000, feet, are rare exceptions ; that off-sets, curves, angles, &c, frequently occur, and often when least expected; that in numerous instances, as in the mines of Cerro de Pasco, in Peru, of Santa Eulalia, near the city of Chihuahua, in northern Mexico, and in the recent remarkable discoveries at White Pine, in central Nevada, ores of immense value are found in beds, or irregular masses, where such a thing as a vein or lode cannot, properly speaking, be said to exist ; that some times, as in the Winnemucca district, in Humboldt county, Nevada, the precious metals are found in a net-work of innumerable small veins, intersecting at all angles over an area of several hundred acres. In none of these cases cited am I able to perceive how patents under this law can protect tho holders against litigation, or even materially diminish the chances of dispute, or give to the miner any better security than he already enjoys under his \"local rules and customs.\" In my humble opinion this whole idea of giving patents to leads or lodes, as such, is erroneous, and can give to patentees no compensating advantages for the trouble and expense necessary under the present law. If the mineral lands must be sold, I would suggest the ollowing as the only plan which has ever occurred to me by which an unassailable title can be secured to the patentee. When a valuable mine is proven to exist, whether of gold, silver, cinnabar, or copper, and whether found iu a vein, lode, bed, or deposit, upon proper application of the owner thereof, and his compliance with such necessary rules as may be prescribed, let patent issue to him for a certain amount of land, including his mine. Whether tbere be one lode or ten, or no lode at all, let the patentee have absolute title to everything contained in the land for which his patent calls, but nothing more. Let him work his mine or mines to any depth, but give him no reserved right to follow his vein or lode, \" although it may enter the land adjoining.\" Let it be his misfortune if his land has not been properly located so as to cover and include his mine. Under such a system there would, doubtless, be cases of individual hardship, such as cannot be guarded against in the framing of any general law ; but the patentee would be effectually protected against all the ordinary chances of ordinary litigation and dispute. There would be no controversy likely to arise between him and an adjoining claimant which could not be readily decided upon the testimony of a competent engineer. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, O. B. O'BANNAN, Register. W. S. Keyes, Mining Engineer, Helena, Montana Territory. The following is communicated by Mr. Foote : Helena, Montana, November 26, 1868. SIR : Yours of the 24th instant has been duly received. I regret exceedingly that I cannot devote as much time to the subject as its importance requires. My duties and engagements occupy so great a share of my time that any remarks I can make in regard to the practical workings ofthe mineral land act will necessarily be brief and imperfect. It would afford me great pleasure to make a careful and detailed statement of my observations and notes upon the subject, but the time given me for their preparation is too short to be as explicit as I could wish. The act of Congress of July 26, 1866, generally known as the mineral land act, was looked upon with favor by the miners, and was hailed as one that would inure to their benefit, and I will add that so far as my observations extend, the act itself is still regarded with great favor by a majority of the miners ; the general dissatisfaction that seems to exist is based on the fact that the act has been in force nearly three years, and as yet no patent has been granted or issued on any lode. It is true that rumors have been circulated that one patent has been issued on a tract of mineral land iu California, covering an area of between 300 and 400 acres, but this is not regarded as a patent on a lode. Numerous applications for patent have been made in this Territory, and quite a number of final surveys have been made. Among those who have completed their applications and made their entries there seems to be general dissatisfaction, many of them expressing the opinion that their time and money have been thrown away, thus discouraging others and preventing many applications being made. There are hundreds of miners who are desirous of availing themselves of the benefit ofthe act, but they are discouraged by those who have tried to obtain a government title. Could one patent to a lode mine issue to any person in this Territory, it would cause hundreds to take the initiatory steps to secure patents to their mines. There are but few miners who are acquainted with the manner of doing business in the General Land Office, and it does not appear to them that the certificate which they receive from the local land office is their evidence of title. Until the patent is issued they remain in doubt whether the patent will issue for so many feet on their lode, or for so many acres of land, leaving them still a contestable title to their lode or vein. This doubt seems to arise from the fact that the first surveys which were made in this Territory, and which were made in accordance with the mineral instructions of January 14, 1867, the instructions of the"], [168, "156 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES surveyor general, and the local rules, regulations, and customs of miners, i. r,., by surveying and marking the required number of feet along the apparent general course of the lode and placing a well-built mound at each end of the claim, in cases where the side lines or corners were unknown, (see page 6, circular of Mineral Instructions, January 14, 1867,) were decided to be incomplete, and subsequent instructions required the side lines to be in all cases actually run, surveyed, and marked, thus confining their surface or working-ground to the land surveyed, which, in many cases, (at points remote from the discovery or worked portions of the lode) would be hundreds of feet from the vein or lode, aud absolutely value less for working purposes. The local law of this Territory, i. e., the act of the territorial legislature, allows 50 feet on each side of the lode for working purposes. It would, there fore, be impossible to locate the exact position of the side lines to a claim in accordance therewith until the lode had been traced and defined on the surface its entire length, which, in many cases, would be impossible, from the fact that lodes do not always crop out on the surface, and in other cases it would require the expenditure of thousands of dollars in useless surface tracings. Another great cause of complaint is the requirement of the land office that applicants should prove that no other known veins or lodes exist on the ground surveyed. This require ment seems to be almost a complete estoppel to acquiring title to any valuable lode, for the reason that, as soon as any lode has been discovered and proved to be valuable, hundreds of prospectors and \"wildcat lode-stakers \" immediately repair to the vicinity and dig the whole surrounding country full of shafts, tunnels, prospect-holes, \"coyote holes,\" &c, staking and recording every lode, spur, seam, and even boulder, as if running in every con ceivable direction. Some of these may prove to be separate lodes, and may even cross the original lode. The owners of these separate lodes would of course be entitled to hold them, and it would be impossible for the owners of the original and valuable lode to prove that on any defined piece of land which they might have surveyed there were no other known lodes existing at the time of their application. This requirement seems unnecessary, and even unjust, considering the provision of the act limiting the location to one vein or lode, and the provision that the owners of a mine shall have the \"right to follow their vein or lode with its dips, angles, and variations to any depth, (and I think it is the spirit and intention of the law to mean in any direction) although it may enter the land adjoining, which land adjoining shall be sold subject to this condition.\" Lodes are generally narrow, crop out at one point, and it may be not again for a long dis tance ; no survey can follow them. If they dip, as they almost always do, no straight line can follow them on the surface, iu a hilly country, owing to the change made in the surface course of the lode by the dip coming into contact with the hills or depressions in the surface. How, then, can the law require a surface survey, when that surface survey almost invariably must fail to cover the lode sought to be secured 1 If it be the lode that is sold, then all metes and bounds, except the lines limiting the length of the claim, are unnecessary. Such end lines can be as easily run, surveyed, marked, located, witnessed, and perpetuated by monu ments, and platted in the office as though side lines were surveyed therewith aud a defined tract of land enclosed, and there could be no possible mistake or question in regard to the locus of such claim. If it be surface ground that is sold it cannot by any possibility be shown that no other lodes exist on the ground surveyed, neither can it be shown (when no surface indications exist, which is generally the case) that the lode sought is situated its entire length on the tract surveyed. Iu fact, I think the greatest difficulty that exists iu the working of the law will be found in the incompatibility of the words \"lode \" and \" tract.\" AVhen miners aud mill owners apply for patents to defined tracts of land for mill sites, they do not seek nor desire to obtain title to any mines that may exist on such land ; they merely apply for title tothe surface land without including any mines or minerals; nor do they intend to debar miners from working such mines should they exist. This simple segrega tion of mining and surface rights has always worked satisfactorily and smoothly in the min ing regions ; and it seems to have been the intention of the framers of the mineral land act to legalize such segregation in accordance with the local customs and usages. The only suggestion I can make iu regard to an amendment ofthe present law, is to com pletely eradicate the words acre and tract, when applied to vein or lode mines, and place a price per foot linear measurement on the lodes, granting in conjunction therewith, a perpet ual lease or privilege to the surface ground for a certain distance on each side of the vein, for working purpose3. And that when any title is granted to tracts of surface ground in the mineral regions, for milling or other purposes, this mining privilege or right be reserved in the grant. Either this must be done, or a complete and absolute revolution in the mining rules, regulations, and customs of the western States and Territories must be made, and absolute titles to land granted iu accordance with the maxim: \" Cujus est. solum ejus est usque ad c\u0153lnm.\" Any such innovation upon long established customs and usages of miners, could only be accomplished with the greatest difficulty ; and before any such radical change should be attempted, a commission of practical and scientific men should be appointed to fully investigate all of the local laws, usages, and customs of miners ou the public domain. Yours respectfully, GEORGE B. FOOTE, Deputy U. S. Mineral Surveyor, Mineral District No. 2, Montana Territory. W. S. KEYES, Mining Engineer."], [169, "157 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. It will thus be seen, I think, that, without further emendation or addi tion, the law is both tedious and vexatious. Second. It is excessively costly. In this particular I have the additional testimony of Captain W. W. De Lacy, United States deputy mineral land surveyor. His experience is that no patent can possibly be ob tained at an expense less than $400, and if the distance be considerable it might cost $500. If, hoAvever, the claim be contested no estimate can be made of the possible or probable cost. Mr. Foote has made contracts to survey and perfect title for the sum of $400. Moreover, expensive as the suryrey is to the miner, the compensation allowed to the surveyor is entirely inadequate. He receives only $10, currency, per diem ; out of this he must pay at least one assistant $5 per day ; must further pay his own transportation and hence there is little or nothing left for his profes sional services. Under such circumstances it is extremely difficult to engage the services of competent men. Another hardship is that two surveys must be made. The first may be entrusted to any surveyor ; the second must be performed by one of the regularly appointed deputies of the surveyor general after compli ance with certain prescribed formalities. No further proof is, I think, necessary to establish the second objection, viz : that the execution of the law is excessively costly and bears heavily on the mining interest. Third. Even the issuance of the patent does not materially diminish the probability of litigation. Instructions to the local surveyors would seem to imply that the sur face as patented must contain the lode ; and it is especially ordered that where the lead makes a turn, stakes must be set. The theory of the law would, therefore, make the patent a general notice to all men that the ground so included embraces the well-defined boundaries of the claim. Prior to full exploration this is an utter impossibdity, and to demonstrate this point fully and satisfactorily would often require the expenditure of thousands of dollars. A gallery may be driven on the vein, under favor able conditions, as low as $10 currency per foot, and if it were required to follow the A*ein a distance of 2,200 feet it would cost no less than 10x2200 = $22,000 ; .. e., it is practically impossible, under the law, to giy*e a surface within Avhich the ATein shall surely be found. Again, if there be a throw or fault in the A7ein, no foresight can fix its position ; and, as a consequence, no surface location can, \u00ab priori, be made. To aA*oid this difficulty the local laws and customs permit the claim -holder to follow his lode where,Arer it may run, aud as this provis ion has been recognized in the law of 1866 the surface patent is practi cally valueless, and after, as before, costly excavations may be required to prove whether two contested locations be or be not one and the same vein. It might further be a question as to what right a patentee had in the surface patented after his lead should have been proven to haA*e passed out of such surface, and, per contra, whether he had a right to other 50 feet where his lead does actually run. So that, all things considered, a patentee is no better off than if he had obtained no patent, and may be called upon to proA*e his vein in the same manner as now. Fourth. The laAV has brought and can bring little or no reArenue to the general goA*ernment. Mr. McLean, the receiver of the United States Land Office, informs me that, under the law, 43.93 acres have been entered, and as fractions are chargeable at the same rate as full acres, there has been received in all the sum of $285, a paltry total for the length of time the law has been in force. The small number of applications up to the present time, and the gen eral apathy, still more conclusively prove that few if any further appli-"], [170, "158 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES cations will be made. Indeed I do not myself believe that the general government should seek to draw from the mineral lands any revenue over the necessary expenses other than the incidental advantages to be derived from an increased production of the precious metals. It is un necessary, I trust, to bring any argument to substantiate this proposition so generally recognized iu all the legislation of every enlightened govern ment. Enough has, I think, been adduced to prove that the present law is vicious and inexpedient, that its provisions bear hardly upon the min ing interests, and that it ought to be either repealed or essentially amended. Objection, it may be argued, is easy, and fault-finding possible, to the lowest order of intellect. To offer a remedy is, therefore, rightfully to be demanded of all objectors. In examining the question, then, on the broad ground of statesman- ship and an enlightened political economy, we must consider not only what is absolutely best, but also how nearly such a standard can be ap- proached in a manner feasible and acceptable to the people. I am well aware that the mining communities look upon all legislation touching the mines with great jealousy, and will resist, as far as they can, any encroachments upon what they consider their vested rights \u2014 ATested, because the government has for so long a time made no attempt to assert its paramount title. Hence a laisser faire policy is the only one likely to meet with any general approbation. In view, however, of the ever-increasing importance of the mineral interests of the United States \u2014 interests embracing an area of country more extensiATe than the average kingdoms of Europe, and destined to build up towns and cities and to support a population far more numerous than our present grand total of all the States; in A'iew of the magnitude aud far-reaching scope of the industry, it behooAes our legislators to do nothing hastily, and to make no laws whateA'er without first carefully searching the whole subject and comparing the mining laws of eAery other country. Ou such as bigotedly refuse to listen to the experience of other miniug countries, and believe that no good is possible unless it be a home production, no impression can be made. That such men make up no small proportion of a mining community will be evident even to the most superficial observer. With all diffidence I venture to suggest the folloAving as the only feasi- ble and statesmanlike solution of the difficulty : Let Congress appoint a commission, consisting of two or three representatiy-es of the people and one or more prominent mine-owners from each of the mining regions. Let the commissioners secure all possible testimony directly bearing on the mining interests. Let them be empowered to call for persons and papers; to examine experts, mine-OAvners, and people from the mining States and Territories. Let them, further, investigate the general laAvs gOA7erning mines in foreign countries*; and let them obtain the fullest exposition of the local laws and customs governing mining claims throughout the national domain. For such a commission Ave haAre, as a precedent, the action of the Eng- lish Parliament, prior to taking action in regard to purchasing the rights of the Hudson's Bay Company's territory in British America. That such a commission would entail a heavy expense upon the government is no valid objection, for the reason that the interests and communities to be affected by its action are as worthy of consideration as any others. In no other way, in my judgment, can any general legislation be inaugu rated Avhich shall not work Avide-spread injustice and cripple, if not demoralize, the entire industry."], [171, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 159 In my humble opinion, fortified by years of familiarity with the mining laws of Germany, of Mexico, and of the various mining districts of the United States, tlie \"local rules and customs\" are too uncertain for secur ity, and are entirely inadequate to prevent that litigation Avhich is and has been the curse of our mining system. I totally dissent from that portion of the local law which gives the mine-owner the right to follow all the dips, spurs, angles, and variations of his lode, even though it may enter the land adjoining, unless it be amended by forbidding parallel locations within a reasonable distance of the first point of discovery. I object to the law as it now is, for the reason that it is the fruitful source of litigation and A'iolence. No law should be tolerated which does not give a reasonable freedom from assault; and the vicious system at present in vogue, of allowing subsequent locations in close proximity to the first, has fostered and will foster the most vexations litigation. As long as nothing of value is found, no attempts are made to interfere Avith exploration. As soon, however, as a valuable deposit of ore is reached, a multitude of claimants appear, under the specious plea that the development is upon a dip, spur, angle, or variation of some previously discovered lode ; and all the technicalities of the law are at once brought to bear to obtain possession. It is this uncertainty of title, fear of litigation and black-mail, which do more to retard mining than all other causes combined. Hence I can see no usefulness in anjr law Avhich does not render unassailable, or at least reasonably so, a title once obtained from the highest authority. To this eud I can conceive of no enactment unless one which gives a surface beneath which, even to the centre of the earth, every precious or useful metal shall be the property of the patentee, or Avhich forbids parallel locations within a certain distance of the point of discovery. Further, I Avould not admit the practical possibility of two true fissure veins running parallel within say 300 feet of one another. Most of the vexatious lawsuits, once so prolific in Nevada, arose from parallel locations. The one lode theory has there become pretty gene rally accepted, and it is due to the resulting freedom from litigation as much as anything else that the Comstock lode now yields an increased percentage of profit on the gross amount produced. Even if a general mining law be unadvisable, it is palpable that the public sentiment of the older States will insist upon its passage ; and the miners should therefore endeaAror so to shape legislation that the mining interest shall receiATe no detriment. The burden of proof that such a law should not be passed remains with the objectors, for the simple reason that all mining countries, both ancient aud modern, have approA^ed of such a course. The Ordenanzas de Miner ia of old Spain, which to this day are in force in all the Spanish American States, have stood the test of \"nearly three centuries. All the kingdoms of Europe have general mining codes. England may, hoAvever, properly be excepted, for the reason that all, or nearly all, the mines are ou land owned by indiyiduals. The Mexican Ordenanzas\u2014 in many respects the best mining code in the world \u2014 give a lode and a certain surface which is determined accord ing to the dip of the lode. Moreover, they require that the mine be worked at least eight months in the year, unless a prorogue for cause be first obtained from the mineral inspector of the district. Litigation is unfrequent, and the mere fact that a mine is claimed is in general suffi cient to prevent any attempt at \"jumping.\" Such laws would not be efficient amongst a population as active and grasping as ours. It is necessary therefore that the mine-owners have full aud undisputed title."], [172, "160 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES How this might best be obtained should, I think, be determined by a government commission. Further, in revising the general mining law I would respectfully sug gest that Congress make provision whereby title can be obtained to lands bearing the following described natural products, viz : borax and soda lagoons ; saltpetre, either in caA*erns or as a surface efflorescence ; alum-bearing clays ; sulphur beds ; coal deposits ; asphaltum deposits ; petroleum ; ozocerite, or natural wax, (called by the Germans Erd-icaclts ;) and salt-beds or springs. The above products are all of commercial importance ; and lands carry ing such are of more ATalue than simple agricultural localities. As the law now reads no title to such deposits can be obtained prior to survey. Hence there is no encouragement to the prospector to seek for them ; and, even if discoATered by accident, no profit is possible, because it is impos sible to acquire title. It is further unjust to a heavily burdened people that such lands should be sold by government for no more than $1 25 per acre. I would suggest that lands bearing such deposits be sold iu bodies of say 40 acres, and at a price not to exceed $2 50 per acre. At the last session of the Montana legislature a general placer mining law was passed ; but little notice was taken of the fact at the time. One of our newspapers has repeatedly attacked it during the last summer. Two gulches, within my own knoAA-ledge, have been taken up in pursu ance of its proAisions ; and my owu observation is that a large number of miners approATe of the measure. Its best feature is that ground once taken cannot be cut down by subsequent arrivals. Much injustice has, in times past, been inflicted upon the discoA'erers by new-comers, who, without the energy to prospect for themselves, are desirous of turning to their own advantage the labors of others. The text of the law is as folloAvs : AN ACT relating to the discovery and possessory right to all placer mines. Be it enacted by the legislative assembly ofthe Territory of Montana : Section 1. That any person or persons who may hereafter discover any gulch, bank, bar, or hill claim or claims, shall be entitled to one claim by discovery-right, and one claim each by pre-emption. Sec. 2. That all gulch claims shall be two hundred feet up and down said gulch and ex tending two hundred feet upon each side from the centre of said gulch. SEC. 3. That all bank, bar, or hill claims shall be two hundred feet square. Sec 4. That a gulch with its banks, bars, and hill-sides shall constitute but one district. Sec. 5. That all claims owned or claimed to be owned by any person or persons shall be represented by actual working of said claim or claims at least two days in each week, except at any time when such claim cannot be practically worked, which shall be determined by two-thirds ofthe claim-holders ofthe district. Sec 6. That there shall be, in each and every district, elected one recorder for such dis trict, whose duty it shall be to record such claims in a book of record, to be at the inspection of all persons, aud to give toauy person or persons a certificate of such pre-emption ; and for such record said recorder shall be entitled to a fee of one dollar. Sec 7. And that before any record shall be made under the provisions of this act there shall be placed at the extremity of each claim or discovery-claim one stake, said stake to be at least two inches in diameter, containing the name of the person or persons pre-empting such claim, and that said person or persons shall have at least fifteen days from staking of said claim to record such claims. Sec. 8. That nothing contained in this act be so construed as to prohibit any person or persons from holding one or more claims by purchase. SEC 9 That any person or persons holding one or more claims by pre-emption or pur chase, and working upon one or digging drain or other ditch for said claim, shall be consid ered an actual representation. Sec. 10. That nothing in this act shall be so construed [as] to prohibit any bodv of miners to the number of thirty, from making any and all local laws which they may wish upon a call of the miners of any district, or upon the posting of a notice of such in three public places giving at least three days\" notice, specifying the time and place of holding of such meeting: Provided, That said laws shall not conflict with vested rights under author ity of this act acquired prior to said meeting.

WXLLIAM ASHBURNER, OF SAN FRANCISCO, ON CERTAIN MINES IN IDAHO. The principal mining region of Idaho, in which most of the capital has been concentrated, is in the southwestern corner of the Territory, in what is known as the Owyhee district, the chief toAvn of which is Sil ver or Ruby City, as it is sometimes called. Here there are many noted mines, which have already produced largely*, paid well, and have mainly caused the great reputation of this Territory. The more productive of these mines, and, in fact, the only ones now being Avorked, are situated near the summit of a high mountain, situated back of the town of Sihxer and known as War Eagle mountain. Here Avithin a limited space, are grouped together the Poorman or the New York and Owyhee mine, the Ida Elmore, the Golden Chariot, and the Oro Fino. All of these ATeins are encased in granite. The present supply of bullion is derived entirely from the Poorman and Ida Elmore, though both the Golden Chariot and Oro Fino are now merely awaiting the erection of hoisting works, and will soon be in operation again. The ores in all these ATeins are simple and easily worked by the ordi nary process of amalgamation. The ores of the Poorman consist prin cipally of the chloride and sulphuret of silvTer, associated with but little copper and antimony ; and the bullion resulting from their treatment contains about J^l 0f gold and of silver, though from the lower workings of the mine the percentage of gold is less. This com pany is now engaged in extracting all the ore above the 358 feet level, and filling in the excavation ; and the value of the bullion per ounce, which is now about $4 19, will be less when this is accomplished and Avork is again resumed in the lower leA*els. This company has 1,650 feet of ground and owns an excellent 20-stamp mill with 16 pans and 8 settlers. They appear to work their ore very closely, and the metallurgist, Mr. Adams, states that the loss does not exceed 10 or 12 per cent, of the assay ATalue. The distance from the mine to the mill is four and one-quarter miles, and from $3 to $3 50 is paid per ton for hauling the ore. The total expenses of this concern are now about $9,500 per month, of which one third is for mining and the other two-thirds for milling. The mining costs from $10 to $12 per ton, and the milling from $12 50 to $15. The present monthly production is not far from $60,000. In April and May last the total production was $124,300, which was obtained by working 850 tons, which would show an average yield of $146 24 per ton, and this may be regarded as the present value of the ores. In 1866, how ever, the ore Avhich was taken from near the surface was very much richer, having averaged $229 41. H. Ex. Doc. 54 11"], [174, "162 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES The results obtained by this company from July 19 to November 1, 1866, were as follows : About 14 tons were selected from the above ore before it was worked and sent to Newark, New Jersey, where it Avas treated, and the yield was at the rate of $4,000 per ton. It is not to be anticipated that these brilliant results Avill be realized again. The vein is narrower than it Avas formerly, being now only a few inches in width where the best ore is found, though widening in some places to five feet in the poorer portions of the mine ; still there are no reasons for supposing that this will not prove a productive property for years to come. Not far from the Poorman, and in close proximity to each other, lie the Ida Elmore, Golden Chariot, and Oro Fino mines. The vein of the Ida Elmore is about three feet wide and has been sunk upon to a depth of 150 feet. The mine is worked for gold, Avhich con tains a large proportion of silver. The present yield of the rock is at the rate of $140 per ton, and the total monthly production about the same as the Poorman, or $60,000. It is impossible to say how much this mine has produced in the past, but it is known that, duriug a space of eight months, $400,000 Avere extracted by a mill of 10 stamps, and large sums in addition were expended for litigation, so that it is proba ble that at least $600,000 have already been taken out. The mine is yielding at the present time as well as eATer. The Golden Chariot adjoins the Ida Elmore and is upon and part of the same vein. It has been sunk upon to a depth of 150 feet, and some $200,000 extracted, most of Avhich, however, went tOAvards the expenses of the litigation and armed contest with the Ida Elmore. This company is not producing bullion at present, but will be in operation again dur ing the coming autumn or as soon as the hoisting Avorks are completed. The Oro Fino is a claim of 580 feet in length, running parallel on the surface of the ground with the Ida Elmore and Golden Chariot. The vein varies in width from 3 to 14 feet, and dips east at a steep angle. It has I ieen sunk upon to a depth of 220 feet, and drifts have been run the whole length of the claim. Moore & Fogus, the former OAvners, worked some 12,000 tons from this mine, whicii realized $392,000, or at the rate of nearly $33 per ton ; aud it is generally considered that, owing to the dishonesty of the miners aud the abstraction of a large amount of rich specimens, at least $60,000 more should have been obtained. After the failure of these persons, two years since, the property went into the hands of their creditors, who, in eight months, extracted a fur ther sum of $122,000. The average yield of the rock is from $40 to $45 per ton, and the expenses of mining and milling from $25 to $27. The bullion Avhich was deriAred from the rock taken from near the surface was worth $10 or $11 per ounce ; is now only worth $3 60.

In the Flint district, at the town of Owyhee, nine miles south of Sd ver City, is the Rising Star mine, which may be regarded as a repre sentative and typical mine. There are 1,200 feet in this claim. The vein is encased in granite, like all the other veins of the district; it bears north 10\u00b0 20' west, aud dips east at an angle of about 79\u00b0. The ore is an antimonial silver, contain ing a little copper, and is associated with white barren quartz, from which the richer portions are selected by hand. This property was formerly owned by Moore & Fogus, and passed into the hands of the present proprietors, avIio are mostly San Francisco gentlemen, in December, 1867. These parties have attacked the vein by means of an adit 110 feet long, which strikes it at a depth of 50 feet from the surface. From its inter section with the A*ein at this point the lode has been drifted upon tOAvards the north 39 feet, and tOAvards the south for a distance of 110 feet. At the extremity of the northern drift the vein is seven feet wide, and well defined. Towards the south, although the vein was somewhat more broken, its appearance Avas rapidly improving as the works pro gressed in that direction. At the point where the adit intersects the vein this latter is divided into two branches by a seam of rock containing a large proportion of mineral, principally iron pyrites, but entirely destitute of silver. The eastern branch of the vein at this point is 3J feet wide, while the western is 5 feet in Avidth. In addition to the above described works the company have sunk a vertical shaft to the depth of 118 feet, cutting the A*eiu where it is eight feet wide, 65 feet from the surface. From near the bottom of this shaft a drift has has been run southerly, upon the course of the vein, 65 feet, developing very excellent ore, containing ruby silver in considerable quantity. In July last about 160 tons of selected ore had been taken from this mine, which assayed at the rate of $280 per ton. The metallurgical treatment of this ore will be costly, and will require skill and care for its successful accomplishment. The Rising Star company is now erecting a 30-stamp mill, Avith fur naces for the treatment of their ore. This mill will probably be com pleted in December. The old mills, which were built a feAv years ago, are all of them miserable concerns, containing a A*ariety of new-faugled machinery, and entirely unfitted for treating the rebellious ores of this district. The shipments of gold and silver from Ruby city between August, 1865, and July, 1868, or for a period of 35 months, have amounted to $2,969,647 97, or at the rate of $84,847 per month. During a portion of this time there was no production, owing to the entire suspension of the mills and mines in the neighborhood. During the last ten months the shipments have averaged $100,000 monthly from this district, Avhich is the only silver producing region of Idaho. About three-fourths of the total production of the Territory is gold, almost entirely derived from the shalloAV placers, which are decreasing in value yearly. At present the rates of wages are very high in the principal mining districts of the Territory ; $5 a day in gold being paid almost universally to the most ordinary miners. The Chinese find limited employment, at a great reduction, but the prejudice existing against them is as strong in Idaho as elsewhere, and the Indian difficulties have pievented any large immigration."], [176, "164 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES The prices of the principle articles necessary to a mining enterprise in the Owyhee or Flint districts are as follows : Wood, $7 per cord ; lumber, $60 per thousand ; salt, 9 cents per pound ; sulphate of copper, 21 cents per pound ; iron, 14 cents per pound ; flour, $6 50 per 100 pounds. Freight from San Francisco to Umatilla, on the Columbia river, is two cents a pound, and from Umatilla to Owyhee five cents. By November the Central Pacific railroad wiU be completed to Gravelly Ford, on the Humboldt, from whence the distance to these mining regions is only about 150 mdes. The agricultural resources of a large portion of Idaho are good, and, in fact, excellent as compared with the Great Basin ; there are extensive and fertile Aralleys, well adapted to grazing purposes, and to the culti vation of cereals. Moreover it is not likely that the cost of fuel Avill be excessive for many years to come, as there are well wooded mountains within a few miles of the principal mining centres. CHAPTER XVIII. THE WAR EAGLE TUNNEL. The following paper, addressed to eastern capitalists, is interesting because it shows that the writers are alive to the importance of a deep tunnel under War Eagle mountain. I sincerely hope the enterprise may succeed: We, the undersigned residents of Owyhee county, Idaho Territory, believing that the development of the mineral resources of said county is an object of great importance not only to those whose local interest will be affected thereby, but to the whole northern region of the Pacific slope, aud will favorably effect the entire commercial and monetary system of our whole country, and if judiciously managed will afford abundant returns for all the capital necessarily employed for that purpose ; to the end that the attention of eastern capitalists may be directed to this point as a proper field for their enterprise, we join in the following statement of facts : The existence of precious metals in the Owyhee regions in quantities sufficient to repay the labor of extracting them was first discovered during the summer of 1863, and the stream known as Jordan's creek and its tributaries have ever since been worked for gold deposits found therein. During that season several quartz lodes of remarkable richness were discov- ered and located, among the first of which were the Oro Fino, Morning Star, AVhiskey, War Eagle, Silver Legion, and Silver Chord; and during the year following the Home Ticket, Baltic, Boorman, and numerous other valuable lodes were discovered. \u25a0 The first quartz mill was built iu the summer of 1864, and since that time ten other mills have been erected in the county; and although many of them were built by parties who had little or greatly inadequate capital to meet the expenses of their enterprise, still it is believed that all who have persevered have received a remunerative return for the meoney invested. The quartz mining district of Owyhee is situated in a peculiarly favorabl position for the advantageous development of its mineral wealth, the principal obstacle being its great dis- tance from any commercial centre ; but this objection is being fast overcome by the rapid construction of the Central Pacific railroad, which will in a few months time place us within forty-eight hours travel from San Francisco. The mineral belt appears to traverse tbe coun- try in nearly a north aud south direction, and the lodes found within it to preserve, with occasional deviation, the same general course. The Owyhee group of mountains is composed of four or five high peaks surrounded by many smaller ones, of which tha one known as War Eagle mountain is the highest, and unconnected with any mountain range. They are surrounded by the valley of Snake river on the northern and eastern sides, and the valleys of smaller streams on the southern and wes'ern sides. The War Eagle rises to an elevation of about 3,000 feet above the valley of Snake river, is of granite formation, and is traversed by hundreds of gold and silver bearing quartz veins, varying in width, where they cut the surface, from, a few iuches to eight and ten feet. Many of these veins are thc richest ever known ; and it is believed that all, or nearly all, of them contain the precious metals in suf- ficient quantities to pay for working them when the proper facilities have been provided. It is a characteristic feature of nearly all these quartz lodes that they increase in width and richness as they have been followed downward from the surface of the earth. The deepest level yet reached is about 400 feet from the surface, where the ore surpasses in richness and"], [177, "WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 165 quantity anything found above it. The constantly and rapidly increasing expense of raising the ore and water to the surface as the work progresses has been found in Owyhee, as else where, the principal impediment to the profitable working of the mines. For this purpose a constant outlay of money for hoisting works, pumps, steam-engines, fuel, and labor is now indispensible ; tbe aggregate expense of which, if it could be saved, would form no incon siderable part of the profits of the best mines among us. To avoid this the obvious aud only expedient is to penetrate through War Eagle mountain with a tunnel of sufficient size to afford drainage and an outlet for all the ore that may be found within it ; and fortunately the formation of the mountain is peculiarly inviting to such an enterprise. It is situated between the two streams known as Jordan creek, on the south western side, and Sinker creek on the northern and eastern sides ; and those streams are about two miles apart. A tunnel commenced on Jordan creek at a point opposite the highest elevation of, and con tinued through the mountain in an easterly direction to a point of equal elevation, on Sinker creek, would cut through at nearly a right angle all the lodes now worked, and all that appear upon the surface, and probably as many more \"blind lodes,\" which are usually the richest. It would intersect the best and most productive of them now known, at a depth of from 300 to 1 ,600 feet below the surface. It would probably penetrate beds of ore surpassing in richness anything ever known before. It would certainly pay a good interest ou the capital invested by way of tolls from the owner of mines, who would use it to transport their ore to the surface. To such an enterprise the laws of this Territory hold out very great inducements, giving to the owners ofthe tunnel all the blind, unlocated, and forfeited lodes reached by such tunnel for 500 feet on each side of the tunnel. In view of the great benefits and advantages which must certainly, and the still greater benefits that will probably accrue to the parties who will carry into execution the object above mentioned, we have no hesita tion in recommending the prosecution of the enterprise to all who desire to make a profitable investment of capital. In regard to the amount of capital necessary to be employed, it is impossible to give a very accurate estimate, depending as it must upon the plan and means adopted, the unforseen obstructions or facilities it may meet with, and the degree of economy exercised in its execu tion ; but there is every reason to believe that the enterprise will become not only self-sus taing, but profitable before it is half completed. The undersigned are well acquainted with Mr. George Collin Robbins, the gentleman who has undertaken to organize a company to construct such a tunnel. He has been identified with the progress of the Owyhee mining region since its earliest development. He was the superintendent of the New York Gold aud Silver Mining Company, (now Owyhee Mining Company,) and to his judgment, energy, tact and perseverance, that company is largely indebted in securing the \"Poorman\" and the other valuable mines it owns. He has perhaps a more thorough and correct knowledge of our mines in general and in detail than any other man ; is well acquainted with the people of this section, and possesses their friendship and confidence in an eminent degree. He has good judgment, untiring energy and perseverance, great self-reliance, is a good manager and economist, and is well qualified to conduct an enterprise of this character to a successful issue.

NOTES ON OTHER MINING FIELDS. CHAPTER XX. ARIZONA. From the address of Governor McCormick to the fifth legislative assembly of Arizona, delivered at Tucson, November 16, 186S, I take the following summary of the mining operations of the year in that Territory : The Wickenburg gold mines are worked without interruption, aud steadily yield a large revenue. The Vulture lode, the Comstock of Arizona, now has a wide and merited fame. It is one ofthe richest, most extensive, and remarkable deposits of gold quartz upon the con- tinent ; aud its returns, up to this time, are believed to be but an' earnest of what may be expected from it in the future. Unfortunately the mills erected in the vicinity of Prescott were put either upon worthless lodes or upon those in which ores predominate which cannot be made to pay by ordinary treatment. The chlorination process has lately been introduced there, and it is expected to prove as successful as in California and Colorado.* If such is the case, the hopeful people who have clung to that part ot the Territory, under most annoying delays and disappointments, will speedily reap the reward due to their patience and pertinacity. Upon the Colorado river little is doing in mining; the low price of copper has not war- ranted the continuous working of the lodes at William s Fork and other points, although a renewal of operations at an early day is promised. From the Eureka district there is a steady and profitable shipment of lead ore to San Francisco ; and work upon several silver lodes in that district is vigorously prosecuted, as it is upon several gold lodes near La Paz and Hardy- ville. Below the Gila the Cababi mines continue to yield a good return of silver, and a fine mill is in process of erection at Apache Pass, where the gold lodes are attracting much atten- tion and give excellent promise. Confidence in the mineral resources of the Territory is unshaken, and those most familiar with them believe that, once secure from Iudiau depreda- tions, and made accessible by the iron rail, Arizona will take front rank among the gold and silver producing districts of the world. The only mine from which I have accurate returns is the Vulture, alluded to in the above-quoted address. This mine, described in the last report of Mr. Browne, (Mineral Eesources, &c, 1868, page 478,) has been productive throughout the year. The 20-stamp mill of the com- pany has been running steadily, and is now running. A new 10-stamp mill has been erected by another company upon an adjoining claim. The Vulture mine is being thoroughly opened ; the buildings, machinery, &c, are receiving constant improvements, and everything promises splen- did results. According to Mr. Browne's report the mill crushed, from November 1, 1866, to September 1, 1867, 4,834 tons of quartz, yielding $145,633, or an average of about $30 per ton, mostly as free gold. Tlie continuation of working results from September 1, 1867, to August 31, 1868, 12 months, is as follows: During this period the mill crushed 10,640 tons of ore, producing $254,110 gold, an average of about $24 gold per ton. The agricultural capacities of Arizona are beginning to attract atten tion, and when the Indian difficulties are settled will doubtless invite a considerable immigration. Most ofthe valley and river bottoms through out the Territory are succeptible of high cultivation. Wheat, maize, barley, and vegetables grow to perfection ; the small attempts made to raise the fruits of the temperate zoue have been successful ; and excel- * I think the governor is mistaken as to Colorado ; chlorination is not established in that Territory, so far as I know."], [180, "168 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES lent pasturage for cattle is unlimited. Large tracts of table-land are well supplied with timber and water; and a great portion of what is now caded desert has a rich soil, aud only requires irrigation to render it pro ductive. Artesian wells and windmills would work miracles in this and many other portions of the Pacific Territories, now barren and desolate. CHAPTER XXI. UTAH. Little can be said of the mining operations of the year in this Ter- ritory. The mines in the neighborhood of Salt Lake have remained idle, aud the few discoveries of placer and quartz gold iu the Wasatch range have not receiATed development. In the southern part of Utah, in Piute county, some mines haAre been found, and prospecting has been carried on with considerable vigor. BeaArer city is the nearest town, 40 miles away ; Salt Lake city is 144 miles, and Pahranagat about 200 miles. The accounts of prospectors represent the country as very faArorable to mining, and abounding in gulch and placer diggings, (paying $5 to $6 per day to the man,) and veins of gold and silver ores. During my stay iu Salt Lake city I had an interA'iew with Mr. Brigham Young, president of the church of Latter Day Saints, and with several leading members of that church. They expressed a cordial desire for the completion of the railroad, and a -willingness to haAre all the natural resources of Utah developed and utilized ; disclaimed any hostility to mining, but admitted that they discouraged their own people from engaging in it because they thought agriculture Avould be far more profitable. Mr. Young expressed the opinion that the ores of Utah had never yet been skilfully treated. \" What we used to call lead,\" said he, \" and dig and melt up into bullets, these fellows call sih'er now ! But if anybody is fool enough to come and mine for it, he may do so, and welcome !\" The private members of the church are not quite so indifferent to the subject as the leaders, but, on the whole, the Mormons have been satis- fied to sell grain and ATegetables to the mining districts, and let mining alone. I met their wagon-traius hundreds of miles away from Salt Lake, in White Pine and other districts, where their wares were in great demand. The A*ast immigration arriving this year at Salt Lake is due, I belieA*e, to the closing up of the Mormon missions in Europe, and the gathering of concerts, as rapidly as possible, to the headquarters of the church. It is said that the policy for the future Avill be that of internal improve- ments and gradual occupancy of the Territory where they have planted themseh*es, aud that the foreign missionary work will be abandoned. If this be true, we may expect their interests as settlers to OA'ercome any prejudices which they may haAre cherished towards any particular industry, and the mineral resources of Utah, whatever they may be, will receive, no doubt, the attention of her citizens. This is already the case with the coal-beds of Weber canon, which furnish an excellent quality of fuel, and supply the city of Salt Lake. The Pacific railroad will, doubtless, make use of it also."], [181, "169 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. CHAPTER XXII. MINERAL RESOURCES OF THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA \u2014 BY I. BLANCHARD MINING ENGINEER. Of the many countries which American enterprise has traversed and explored there is perhaps none so little knoAvn, in proportion to the end- less crowds of travellers passing yearly over it, as the Isthmus of Panama. Many wonderful tales have been told about it at one time or another ; but for some reason, probably the bad reputation of its climate, it has not yet attracted on any extended scale the attention of the mining or scien- tific world. It may not be untimely, therefore, to present a feAv consid- erations concerning the mineral treasures, topographical and climatic conditions of this geographically so important country. There have been many things to prevent a thorough exploration of the isthmus, such as difficulty of access and communications, scarcity of food, exposure to fevers, &c. Yet there are many attractions there for the naturalist, especially the botanist. But the chief features of the country are geological and mineralogical, as might be naturally expected, from the peculiar agencies to A.'hich this strip of mountain betAveen two seas has been subjected in the swift alternation of plutonic and neptunic forces. Nowhere do avc find geological phenomena more diA-ersified and diametrically opposed than here. Close upon neptunic deposits, and overlying them, there are vast surfaces of congealed laA a, trachytic, and phonolitic masses \u2014 strong indications of once active volcanic poAvers; and the metalliferous character of the country itself shows the results of this wild and apparently laAvless succession of geological processes. Unlike the well formed and regularly defined A*eins of California and some parts of Europe, where the same mineral deposit sometimes main- tains for thousands of feet along its course the same appearance and size, the ATeins of the isthmus are frequently faulted, thrown out of their true dip, pinched, or otherwise made to A*ary in character. The difference between the gold region of the isthmus and that of California it is inter- esting to notice. In the latter State, nature has done much to facilitate the exploitation of her treasures by men. The California gold deposits are described as belonging to three epochs. The quartz veius form the earliest ; next to them follow the deep diggings, which are the first nep- tunic secondary deposits ; and finally, out of these secondary deposits are formed the recent placers. In the isthmus, on the other hand, min- eral wealth is not so widely diffused, but more confined to its original localities. The third class of California deposits, the rich gold-bearing alluvial beds, does not exist there ; the other two classes are represented. Of these the \\reins, as being the oldest, first claim attention. A great many laws haA^e been suspected or inA'euted to systematize the occur- rence of auriferous A*eins in general. Some consider them as particu- larly belonging to the tropics ; but this view is not in accordance with facts which show us that gold and gold veins abound iu all quarters of the earth. Those who hold the theory of the essentially tropical char- acter of gold-bearing veins ascribe them to the greater relative velocity of the earth's revolution at the equator than at the poles. Others, again, connect them with the supposed great tides in the interior of the earth, simultaneous with the ebb and flow of the ocean tides, which are known to be extreme in the tropics. Others believe in a regular teuor and ATalue of ore doAvn to sea-level, and an increase or decrease in definite ratio below that line. All these theories being set aside, the facts are simply that the veins of the isthmus combine with their great irregu-"], [182, "170 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES larity, above mentioned, an extreme narrowness, but good average rich ness of ore. Those of the north are generally richer than those ot the Pacific slope. Their thickness varies from 6 to 12 inches, their dip is generally 75\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 southeast, and their course mostly northeast and southwest. The quartz is dense, compact, without selvages, abundantly intermixed with epidote, micaceous iron, copper pyrites, copper glance, peacock ore, galena, zinc blende, arsenical pyrites, &c. Gray copper and autimonial ores I never noticed either on the Atlantic or the Pacific side. Silver does not occur in independent ores, though it is found alloyed Avith the gold, which is very minutely divided in the ore, and often, eA-en in tlie surface ore, uot to be discovered by the usual test of washing in a horn spoon. Fire assay alone determines it. Free gold occurs near the surface; in depth the ore becomes richer, because im pregnated with sulphurets, but at the same time unfit for amalgamation. It is yet to be ascertained whether this non-efficiency of quicksilver upon the sulphuret-bearing quartz is caused by a chemical association. On this point careful aud suitable scientific investigations must decide. The value of the gold quartz of the isthmus, as given by cupellation assay, averages from $40 to $120 gold per ton; the value of sulphurets from $120 to $600. In so-called \" redores,\" containing a great deal of the peroxide of iron from the original sulphurets, there is of course an exceptional richness. Not everywhere does the quartz appear, as above described, in dense flinty masses. This is the case in the richest and narroAvest \\*eins ; but in some others, and particularly in the wider ones, and those which break in porphyritic rocks, the whole A*ein seems to be intersected Avith threads and seams, themsehres imbedded in a matrix of kaolinitic feldspar, iu AAdiich the very crystals of quartz, though still retaining their hexagonal form, have been disintegrated by the action of earths and alkalies. The veins of the Pacific side of the isth mus are generally distinguished by their smaller contents of sulphurets. Their thickness and dip are about the same as those of the Atlantic lodes. The value of the ore seems to range from $30 to $60 gold per ton. The gangue is mostly porphyry. The leading rocks of the isthmus gold formation are ATarieties of green stone \u2014 diorite (amphibole, feldspar, a little quartz) and diabase. Gabbro never occurs ; nor are granite and gneiss found as leading rocks ; but common porphyry and the variety known as feldstein are frequent. These rocks are ATariable in appearance. The diorite, for instance, shows more or less extended segregations of a feldspathic character, often con siderably decomposed. The violence of the geological reA*olutions which have affected this region is clearly shown in the veins. They are fre quently faulted, and sometimes large zones of the A*ein are moved out of their true plane, leaving to the miner little or no indication Avhether he is to seek the lost lode aboA^e or beloAv, to the right or to the left, since the connecting cross course has often become uuder pressure so thin as to be almost imperceptible, and the nature of the country rock gives no clue in Avhat direction it would be most likely to yield or fracture. Among the auriferous deposits we shall consider first the cerros. This name is generally applied in Spanish America to the slopes of moun tains or hills, (as for instance the historic Cerro Gordo,) and, in reference to mining particularly, to plateaux formed of eruptive masses OArerlying auriferous deposits. Whether the gold is accumulated in these deposits by the action of water, or brought there by mere primary geological agencies, is not settled ; for the first supposition speaks the rounded form of the particles, but the fact that these plutonic masses always cover it seems to indicate some relation of causality. It is probable that"], [183, "171 WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. the primary neptunic deposits being formed, were afterwards covered by emissions of fiery fluid masses. The contact of these masses has meta morphosed to some extent the underlying strata, changing clay and gra vel to a kind of cement ; and the working of a cerro, even with more perfect tools than the natiAres have at their disposal, would be difficult, and not very remunerative. From these facts it is easy to predict that the third variety of depos its \u2014 the secondary neptunic or proper placers cannot be very extensively represented on the isthmus. The Atlantic slope is short and steep, giv ing little opportunity for such foriuatious ; and even if the topography were favorable, the cerros are so shielded by the overlying rocks from denudation that such a collection of gold in recent river beds and bot tom lands as California presents is out of the question. This is con firmed also by experience. The beds of creeks and rivers on the isth mus do not yield much gold \u2014 not more than fiAre or six centigrams in 15 kilograms, or three or four cents to the panfid. It is evident, from what has already been said, that there is little chance of profit in Avorking any of the isthmus gold deposits, unless the quartz ATeins. We shall now consider, in closing these remarks, Avhat are the con ditions afforded for the successful working of such veins in this locality. The isthmus enjoys a Avide and well-deserATed reputation for insalu brity. Nowhere is this evil fame more justified than in the districts Avest of Aspinwall, in Code and Veraguas, on the Atlantic slope, where the most numerous and Araluable ATeins are. The atmospheric currents, one from the south, saturated with moisture, and the other cold from the Atlantic, meeting incessantly on the water-shed of the Cordilleras, pro duce by their reciprocal condensations the torrents of rain Avhich deso late the unhappy slopes, (hence Ver-aguas, country of floods;) and the vegetation, overstimulated to rank luxuriance by this excessive moisture and the heat of the climate, aids iu attracting and precipitating the rains. Most of the Atlantic districts have no well-defined dry season, and several of them none at all. Of course, out of these perpetual floods, together Avith the gases eA*olved by the continual decomposition of A-ege table matter, much poisonous miasma must arise, adding its injurious effects to those of the hot sun and the floods. Thus it comes to pass that a portion of the isthmus is shunned by men. From Aspinwall to Bocas del Toro, and from the mountains to the Atlantic, an area of about 1,200 square miles, there are but a few miserable settlements, supported in wretchedness by the catching of fish and turtle. The exceptional climate renders the presentation of food and the con struction of roads alike almost impossible; timber is very scarce, and spongy trees make the worst possible fuel. From Aspinwall to Bocas del Toro there is not one real harbor. The coast is dangerous, as the Gulf Stream is A*ery violent and hurricanes are frequent. Roads on land do not exist, except the official higliAvays, and they exist only on paper! In a country so situated, estimates of the cost of a mining enterprise are necessarily uncertain. Freight is a heavy but a variable item ; labor is scarce, and fluctuates with political changes; the veins themseh*es are narrow, and cannot be relied upon for a large production of ore, nor for a uniform production on any scale. Then all supplies of food, &c, must be brought either on men's\" backs over the mountains from the Pacific, or by sea, on the Atlantic side. None can be obtained in the country. Finally, delays must frequently be suffered from swollen riA^ers or a stormy sea. Such are the economical conditions of mining iu this region. In spite of their uncertainty we shall attempt to give an approximate idea of the expenses and profits of the business."], [184, "172 RESOURCES OF STATES AND TERRITORIES, ETC. EXTRACTION. Metres.

If the vein be worked simultaneously at 15 points (more are scarcely possible) the monthly yield will be 30 tons as the work of 30 men, besides outside laborers and assistants, carpenters, &c. The num- ber of the latter being estimated at 20 and their wages at about 80 cents per day, while the miners get $1 50, (food included,) we have a monthly expense of $1,830, increased by medical attendance, clothing, and interest on the capital employed in bringing laborers to and from the mines, to at least $2,000. The ore thus obtained may be either worked at the mine or conveyed to metallurgical works. Transportation of ore to Europe or the United States.\u2014 A brief cal- culation would show that the expense of freight Avill be far too heaA*y, unless the ore has previously been stamped and concentrated. Of course it is not easy to give an exact estimate of the stamping cost, but it Avould be rather high as compared with California.' Hauling is cheap, but fuel dear. In the concentration there is a loss, of course. Then the expense of maintaining a road to the sea, procuring a vessel for transportation, shipping, storage, commissions, and final sales to some metallurgical establishment, finish the list of transactions. All these expenses must be defrayed out of the net value of the ore, after mining cost is subtracted, or about $133 per ton. Transportation from the mines to the sea is also difficult on account of the rivers, Avhich present every- where a series of rapids, and are liable to sudden floods and droughts. Working ores at the mines.\u2014 The prospects under this system would not be much more favorable. The bad fuel, scarcity of material for con- struction, and lack of roads by which to obtain supplies, make stamping costly; and the treatment of the stamped ore presents an embarrassing question. Smelting is out of the question. Amalgamation is useless. On the southern side of the isthmus labor aud fuel are much cheaper; the. country is accessible and cultivated; but these advantages are annulled, as we have seen, by the smaller value of the ore, narrowness and irregularity of veins, and scarcity of timber, fuel, and water power. Under these circumstances, therefore, there is scarcely a chance of work ing the gold deposits of the isthmus at a profit, and hence they cannot be objects of attention to American adventurers, even leaving out of view the far greater and more enticing advantages of the Pacific States and Territories of the Union."], [185, "PART II RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. \"The sovereign should afford the mine and those who work it all facilities, endue them with gracious priv lieges, without which mining cannot be maintained, protect the works, and show himself most benignant to them, in order to encourage them. Hence should he help poor and struggling miners by gifts of money and timber, by remission or reduction of taxes, and by other means, and strive in every way to stimulate tbe mining business. For this purpose, it is very beneficial if a sovereign makes a well-founded mining law, and after its publication takes pains to have it observed by his officials and mining establishments. He should, moreover, see to it that places of trust are filled with devout, faithful, intelligent people, experts in mining, and that these are so paid as to have no cause to seek profit in evil ways. He should also keep a watchful eye on the mines, and not permit the use of unlawful force against any of them in operation, nor the practice of any swindling, nor that the silver they produce shall be paid for at the mint with money inferior in quantity or quality, since it brings the miners to despair if they receive only copper for the silver they have obtained with sweat aud blood.

Zcdler, Gross. Univ. Lex. Halle, 1733, Art. Bergherr."], [186, ""], [187, "INTRODUCTION. Mining and agriculture are the two great forms of productive indus try. Strictly speaking, agriculture is the most important, since Avithout it men could not exist ; yet mining is almost as essential, since without it men could only exist as savages. All human activities, in material things, are based upon the products of these tAvo, their manufacture and exchange. But there are great differences betAveen mining and agriculture, which indicate that Avhile these arts stand on a par as fundamental sources of the Avealth of nations, they do not occupy the same position in all re spects, and cannot be treated by governments exactly alike. Of these differences I shall point out a few of the most important ones. 1. The products of mining are in general far less perishable than those of agriculture, and, in proportion to their first cost, of greater, because more prolonged, use to mankind. Who can estimate the blessings dif fused by a ton of iron, mined, smelted, Avrought into forms of beauty and usefulness, serAing for generations the needs of men, and repeatedly reforged, and reappearing, as by a material metempsychosis, to enter upon new periods of beneficence . More difficult still is it to measure the importance of gold and sih*er, the production of which, aside from their application in the arts, is so subtly connected Avith the profoundest prob lems of political economy. The sophistry that gold and silver money is a conventional matter altogether is trivial. So is all society conven tional ; and the things upon which mankind haAre agreed are the things which God has ordained. Gold aud silver are Avorld's money, or means of exchange ; and this accepted medium must bear a certain relation to the volume of the world's business. Experience, speaking louder than the philosophers, has shown that, in spite of all contrivances of barter, credit, and paper money, the supply of the precious metals is of vital importance to all commercial nations. 2. Gold and silver are especially valuable as articles of export. If a country produces more grain than it can consume, it must seek a market elsewhere for its surplus, and this market may not be readily found. Besides, there is danger of loss or deterioration by transport and storage. The precious metals, on the other hand, command the markets of the world. They can be shipped or hoarded Avithout deterioration, and they form the best basis of international exchange. 3. But these adArantages of mining are counterbalanced by the fact that its sources are not perpetual. Men till the same soil for generations, and, if it is properly cared for, it is as able at the end as it was at the begin ning to sustain the desired crops. But every mineral deposit is certain, sooner or later, to be exhausted. Sometimes this exhaustion is absolute. The valuable mineral is all extracted, and the end of the deposit is reached. This was the case a few years ago with the silver mines of Andreasberg, in the Hartz mountains.* Sometimes the exhaustion is merely an economical one. The deposits continue, but it no longer pays to work them. This is the disaster looked forward to within the next century by English economists Avith regard to the coal mines of Eng- * The Hanoverian government exerted every effort in vain to discover new veins or con tinuations of tbe old ones. The social problem presented by the cessation of the, mines, depriving- a considerable population of its hereditary profession and only subsistence, was a sad and difficult one Transplantation of tbe miners into other districts, at higher wages, was but partially successful, owing to their home-sickness. The Andreasberg mines are now abandoned."], [188, "176 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. land. In either case the source of wealth is closed, and great national changes are often the result. We may say, then, that mining yields a permanent form of wealth from a transient source, while agriculture presents a perennial source of perishable wealth. 4. The mistakes of mining are always to a greater or less extent irre trievable. Wasteful and ignorant farmers may exhaust the soil ; but nature, time, and skill will restore it. Even the wanton destruction of timber entails upon a nation only a temporary evil, since trees will grow again. But the economical exhaustion of a mine, or a whole mineral region, can be brought about by reckless mining beyond the possibibty of restoration. There are mines in Mexico, for instance, known to have been rich, and to carry in depth the continuation of the same deposits ; but the improAadence of former OAvners, and the ignorance of engineers, have left the mines without adequate timbering or supports, full of water, (which, owing to the irregular nature ofthe excavations, can not be drained nor pumped out, except at enormous expense,) and prac tically inaccessible. The loss of precious metals by ignorance or indif ference in the treatment ofthe ores is another generally irreparable loss. It is the fashion to say that science will discover means by which the \" tailings\" of our gold and silver mines may be profitably Avorked, and many inventors claim to have found the long-sought secret. But the secret is in a more thorough treatment of the ores in the first place. Experience sIioavs that the majority of the fadings in the Pacific States contain gold and silver Avhich cannot now be extracted at a profit. Five dollars per ton, for instance, is not often enough to pay for handling and reducing gold or sdA*er tailings.* And in the best circumstances the loss in the tailings is ne\\*er recovered, since that which Avas a net loss becomes, in subsequent working, only a gross yield. 5. Finally, the resources of mining are not so equally distributed among nations as those of agriculture, and, as a consequence, the relative power of nations depends largely upon their mines. The iron and coal mines of England are well known to be the secret of her commercial strength ; and in our own country the State of California owes her wonderful pro gress and increasing power to the mines. EATen the enormous agricul tural capacity of that State (howeATer much her farmers may sneer at the idea) Avould never haATe been known nor deAreloped but for the gold mines. In ATiew of these peculiar relations of mining, it is eAddent that gov ernments are in a certain sense trustees of the wealth stored in the min eral deposits of their realms \u2014 trustees for succeeding generations of their own citizens and for the world at large. It is not a matter of indifference to the citizens of this country whether our mining fields be raA*aged and exhausted in one or even five centuries, when they might last a score. Nor is this danger far-fetched. The condition of the Comstock lode, after less than eight years of extensive operations, bears Avitness at once to the unprecedented energy and the almost incredible rapidity with which that rich ground has been exploited. The Comstock lode, pro ducing in 18G7 one-fifth, at least, of the total value of bullion yielded by the mines of the country, bids fair to be economically exhausted in two or three years more ; and can apparently only be saved from that fate * I do not here allude to cases in which, from the very outset, arrangements are made for catching, concentrating, and beneficiating the ores that escape from the first processes in gold or silver mills. That is part ofthe regular and wise system of working. It is where that has not been done, and tbe tailings, accumulating in the bed of some stream or iu heaps by the mill, have afterwards been made the basis of independent operations, that suc cess has so often been wanting. In other words, the mistakes of bad management are not to be altogether remedied by subsequent economy."], [189, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 177 by the timely aid of the Sutro tunnel. Certainly one such example should be sufficient to show us the necessity of economy and forethought iu mining operations. If economy had saved and forethought had expended, within the past fiA~e years, the money necessary to construct a deep tunnel, these mines would not noAv be threatened with ruin. The true relation of governments to mining arises out of the position they occupy as representatives of nations and trustees for their future welfare. As I shall hereafter show, by historical reAiew, the notion of a divine right of the crown to the minerals in the soil is almost everywhere extinct; and certainly in this country it could find no foothold nor analogy. The questions for us to decide are tAvo: Avhat is the duty of the government towards the miners; and what is its duty towards the nation and the future . In accordance with the spirit of democracy, it must be granted that the fewest possible restrictions should be laid upon individual enterprise and industry, and that the function of goA-ernment in this respect is to \" secure liberty.\" It is this securing liberty that makes legislation necessary, and hence legislation is demanded of us by way of, not inter ference, but protection. The miner (and I mean to include the capitalist, inATesting money in mines) needs protection by laAv, and this protection should be uniform and just to all. Experience has shoAA*n that in the important matter of ownership, leaA'ing matters to take their own course has been productiATe of much confusion and loss. Capital has been Avronged by the regulations established by labor; and the laboring miners themselves, now asking in A*ainfor the assistance of capital, would gladly Avelcome the establishment of a uniform system by Which the title to mining property could be acquired from the government. The law of 1860 was an important step in the right direction, but its recognition of local customs was too sweeping, and in many districts its proA*isions cannot be complied with. Only one patent has been issued under the law, and that for a quicksilver mine. There is iinperatiA*e need of amendment, and then of prompt execution, of the law. I believe it is acknowledged that taxation of the mines for purposes of reA^enue to the government would be a disastrous policy. Mining can carry no extraor dinary burdens of that kind. It needs every assistance and encourage ment that can properly be giA*en to it. But AA'hen the goA'ernment has discharged its duty towards the miners, there still remains the obligation to do something for the protection of the nation. There are not wanting thoughtful men Avho doubt the wisdom of surrendering entirely to the patentees of mines the mineral title.* Whether this step was wise or not, (and I think it was wise,) the gOA' ernment cannot now recede from it without trouble, and it remains to inquire Avhat methods are still open to us to prevent wasteful and unscien tific mining, and to secure the maintenance of a steady product of bul lion, so important to the country. Detailed legislation, regulating the operationsof mining, the rights of partners, the proper measures of safety, and the forms of litigation, must be left to the different States. The true and only course Avhich the federal government can take in the discharge of its duty as trustee of our vast mineral resources is to establish some agency for the spread of knoAAiedge among the mining communities, aud * \" Considerations of public policy may yet demonstrate the evil of granting an absolute title by the United States, absolved from all conditions, by placing tbe subject-master of the title beyond tbe reach of State legislation, leaving us, as a nation, beyond the reach of some \u25a0wholesome mining system or code, which has always signalized nations rich in the precious and the useful metals.\" (Legal Titles to Mining Claims and Water Rights in California under the Minim** Law of Congress, by Gregory Yale : San Francisco, 1867.)

Communication established among the thousands, all engaged in mining, aud all wrestling with the same natural aud economical difficulties, opportunity once given for every man to obtain the information he seeks in regard to his business, and the evils of the present state of things will vanish before the enlight ened self-iuterest of those who, owning the mines, will be most desirous to work them with true economy and forethought. Following the succession thus indicated, I shall discuss, first, the ques tion of a national mining law, and second, the A'arious ways in which the government may, while it assists rather than interferes with mining, protect the interests of the country by bringing about a better system of mining, and putting an end to the reckless and ignorant practices noAv so common. The relations assumed by governments toward the industry of mining have differed AVidely in different ages, and the character and prosperity of that industry has been directly affected, in different countries, by the course pursued in this respect on the part of the state. In the United States the problem is now presented on a large scale for the first time, but it is a mistake to suppose that no light can be thrown upon it by the experience of other nations. On the contrary, history is full of instruc tive lessons upon this subject, and I think these lessons, rightly con strued, confirm the decision to which the genius of our institutions and the nature of our present circumstances would naturally lead us. In adopting a wise and permanent policy toward the mining interests of this country, we cannot fail to be assisted by the study of the past, and the experience of those nations in which mining has been most success fully carried on for centuries may serve us as a general rule.

SECTION VI. MINING LAW. CHAPTER XXIII. MINING AND MINING LAAV AMONG THE ANCIENTS. The main subject of the present discussion being the history of mining jurisprudence, and the consideration of that subject being limited as far as possible to its bearings on the immediate problems of legislation in the United States, I shall not attempt to collect, in this chapter, all that is known of the practice of ancient nations in regard to the arts of mining aud metallurgy. The theme is an exceedingly attractive one, and on another occasion may be not inappropriate. I am aware that a more extended treatment of it would add greatly to the popular interest of this report, but I consider it more important to preserve the continuity of the argument which I am endeavoring to construct, and to introduce no threads which cannot be gathered into the conclusions Avhich I hope to establish. Our knowledge of the legislation of earlier times has to be, however, in great part inferred from circumstantial evidence, or from the records which remain of ancient practice. A frequent reference to the history of mining, as distinguished from that of mining law, is unavoidable ; yet this chapter must not be considered as even a complete outline, much less a comprehensive summary of all that is known to antiquarians on this interesting subject. In comparison Avith the literature concerning the dress, language, mythology, and poetryr of the ancients, avc have very few books about the much more important questions connected AAith their proficiency in the mechanical arts, and especially the arts of mining and metallurgy. Authorities. \u2014 Tavo books published during the last century are the only ones which have come to nry knowledge in which the indications and fragmentary facts contained in ancient literature or existing ruius, observed by traArellers, have been collected and systematically arranged. One is the work of Caryophilus, De Auri et Argenti Fodinis Veterum, of which I haA*e not yet been able to find a copy in this country, though it is accessible in sevTeral libraries abroad ; the other is a dissertation in the German language, by Dr. J. F. Eeitemeier, published in Gbttingen, 1785, and entitled Geschichte des Bergbaues und Hiittenwesens bei denalten, Vblkern. This admirable essay received the prize of the Royal Society of Sciences at Gottingen. There is a copy in the city library of Boston, to the superintendent of which I am indebted for the courtesy with which he placed the book at my disposal. Ancient authorities are more numer ous, but not so satisfactory, since they give us mostly mere allusions or accidental revelations. Among them Ave may mention the Bible, Hero dotus, Strabo, Pliny, Diodorus, Agatharcides, Clement of Alexandria, Aristotle, {de mirabilibus, de cura rei familiaris, etc.,) Dioscorides, Livy, and Polybius, not to mention a multitude of classic writers from Avhose AA-orks intimations of importance can be gleaned, such as Xenophon, C\u00e6sar, Plutarch, and even the legendary poems of Homer and Hesiod. To these sources of information must be added the works of various"], [192, "180 RELATIONS OF GOATERNMENTS TO MINING. medi\u00e6val and modern travellers, and the researches of antiquarian scholars in special fields of inquiry, too numerous to be catalogued here. The origin of mining.\u2014 The art of mining is linked with so many others, which are the fruit of civilization only, and must be practiced under so many natural difficulties, which ouly advanced science has been able to overcome, that Ave may naturally believe it to have had neither a very early nor a very rapid development. No doubt the first races Avere led to the discovery of one metal after another by accident rather than sys tematic study of nature. Probably the first metals used by men were those occurring in a native state \u2014 such as gold, silver, and copper. The discovery of bronze, or the secret of hardening copper by rude metallur gical processes and mixture with other metals, Avas a step in the progress of the human race so important that it marks an epoch of prehistoric time, known as the age of bronze. The peculiar properties of gold and silver \u2014 their beauty, malleability, and above all their resistance to oxi dation, AAhich rendered their presentation possible through long periods, Avere undoubtedly the ground of that high esteem in which they have always been held, and which is at the present day enhanced by their rela tive scarcity, and the difficulty of obtaining them. The knowledge of these metals seems to have been indigenous in all countries where they occur, whether among the tribes of Asia, of Siberia, or of North America. Gold and silver are the A and B of the alphabet of metallurgy ; and, although the mastery ofthe whole alphabet and its combinations in the literature of ciA'ilization has beeu the laborious work of ages, and is not yet complete, these first letters of it were beneficently made easy for man to discover. The rudiments of mining are first found iu those countries where the human race itself probably had its origin. The Bible informs us that eA'en before the Noachian deluge, some of the peoples of Asia understood the use of iron \u2014 but this knowledge does not appear to haA*e been propagated among other nations. The Siberians and the Peruvians most certainly did not possess it, and other nations have made the discovery at a comparatively late period ; but this only cor roborates what we havTe already said, that the knowledge of metals Avas not, iu the beginning, transmitted from one nation to another, but was the child of circumstances and accidental discoA*ery in different parts of the Avorld. At any given epoch of the first historic eras, before com merce and literature had produced an interchange of commodities and ideas, it is to be supposed that some nations would be more advanced than others in these respects. If the use of iron was confined to the race destroyed by the flood, then it perished with them. At a much later period we learn that the Chaldeans aud Assyrians possessed gold, silver, and \" brass.\" The Ph\u0153nicians had also an abun dance of metals ; and it is more certain, iu their case, that they obtained their supply from some sort of systematic mining. Their country itself was not rich in mineral wealth. Possibly they worked the copper mines at Sarepta, but these were their only mines at home. But then* extended commerce brought them into connection Avith other countries abounding in the treasure they sought; and they went to islands ofthe Mediterranean for gold and other metals, including iron, of Avhich they understood the use, ascribing its discovery to tAvo of their mythical heroes. They are knoAvn also to haA*e mined in Spain, (probably for \" Tyriau lead\" and silver,) and they even touched the distant shores of Britain in their bold explorations, and gathered the tin ore of Cornwall and Devon. But at least an equal antiquity, and a much greater elaboration and system, must be recognized in the mining of the Egyptians. Under the reign of Osiris, the Egyptian mines of copper, silver, and gold were in"], [193, "181 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. productive operation. Both on the Ethiopian and the Arabian border, and near Saba, (which may or may not be Sheba of the Bible,) they worked the ores of their country. The Sinaitic desert, through Which the Israelites travelled, contains to this day the ruins of mining works, the origin of Avhich is shrouded in mystery, but may well be ascribed to that wonderful people the Egyptians', the extent of whose aohiev.e\u0153tents in many directions the world is just beginning to estimate aright. They did not learn the use of iron so early as that of some other metals. Abra ham found gold and silver used for instruments, ornaments, and cur rency among them, but no mention is made of iron. In the time of Moses, howeATer, as is evident from two passages in Deuteronomy, the Egyptians smelted iron. Mines of the Persians and Egyptians. \u2014 In the early times, as in all sub sequent periods, conquest was one of the foes of mining. The Egyptians were twice conquered by the Ethiopians, and had several Assyrian Avars, which must not only h&\\e produced such a disturbed condition of affairs as prevented the prosecution of mining, but also have drawn into the military service the classes of laborers employed in that business. The final establishment of the Persian dominion remoAed the disturbances from without, but the tyranny of the proATincial gOAernors produced numerous reArolts, Avhich doubtless had a disastrous effect upon mining. The Persians, hoAvever, amassed much treasure from their conquests, and obtained from the Egyptian mines, in particular, the finest silver. The strength which wealth imparted to this dynasty was painfully felt by the Greeks, iu the A~ast armies Avhich inAraded their territory and the bribes with which their leaders were corrupted. The first period in the history of mining closes with the overthrow of the Persian empire byr Alexander, and the transfer of the treasure and resources of the Orient into European hands. Meagre as are our data for this period, we are nevertheless led to a reasonably certain conclusion Avith regard to the tenure and authority under which mining was carried on. We hear of kings, like Cr\u0153sus, enriching themselves from the product of the mines ; but there is no indication that these sources of wealth were open to private citizens. The immense quantities of gold and silver employed by gOATernments, and their use in constant wars, also confirm our conjecture that the mines of Asia and Africa Avere the property of the rulers, and that they were worked by slaA*es. This Avas certainly the case in Egypt, in the following period. It is probable, therefore, that the doctrine of ownership by the crown of the metals in the earth was originally established by tyranny, and that before its establishment mining, like agriculture, was carried on by the citizens. The story of Joseph, in the Bible, sIioavs by what means the despot of Egypt Avas able to destroy the individual industry of agriculture, and to turn the whole kiugdom into his own farm. Doubtless the process of \" consoli dation\" in mining followed a similar course. In the second period there was apparently still greater activity and extent of mining operations ; at least our information on the subject is more satisfactory. Gold, silver, copper, and iron were obtained in Ethiopia, and iron at least in Libya, Possibly the recent discoveries of gold in Africa, which are now attracting considerable attention from the English, are but rediscoveries of the fields worked centuries before Christ. India and Caramania produced gold, and the latter country also silver, copper, and cinnabar. The people, however, are said by Strabo to have been A^ery ignorant of the art of working metals. The Derb\u00e6 did not know how to melt their gold dust into lumps, and the Indians sold crude specimens of rich ore to foreigners. The Chaly beans,"], [194, "182 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. on the other hand, became famous as workers in iron, and deriA^ed their principal revenue from this source. Iu Asia Minor the gold mines for merly owned by Cr\u0153sus were worked down to the times of Xenophon, but Strabo says that in his day they were exhausted, and only traces of them remained. There Avere iron mines and skilled workmen in Pal estine. Arabia Felix is celebrated by many ancient writers as possess ing very rich gold and silver mines, but no traces of them now remain, nor have modern traveUers observed auriferous sands in any of the streams of that country. Historical testimony on the subject is, hoAV eATer, quite positive and unanimous, and the matter may be considered as still in doubt. It is uot impossible that the ancient writers, who were not always exact in such statements, mistook the treasure obtained by the Arabians through their Indian commerce for a product of their own soil. We may well believe that this wide-spread development of mining, accompanied as it was with a diffusion of government, brought about some change in the mining law. The loosely-strung empire of Alexan der fell to pieces after his death, and no doubt the mines became the property of governors, generals, nobles, and wealthy citizens. We have, however, in Egypt a type of the general systems which obtained, on a greater or smaller scale, throughout the petty despotisms which divided the world. Diodorus gives us a picture of Egyptian mining, partly taken from the earlier work of Agatharchides. According to this account the mines of Egypt were the property of its kings, who obtained immense sums from them. Those were in one sense the palmy days of mining; for the kiug got his mining ground gratis, worked only the richest deposits, captured or reduced to slavery the necessary laborers, and levied contributions on his kingdom for the necessary food and other mining supplies. Rich mines, worked at no expense, naturally paid handsome dividends. Machines were not employed to any extent, since human power was cheaper. The Egyptian monuments Avhich remain to us represent the most stupendous works of engineering, as accomplished by the labor of countless multitudes of men. The labor of the mines was performed by prisoners of war, comicts, and purchased slaves. As the Egyptians were not a warlike people, and seldom returned from battle victorious, it is not likely that their prisoners were numerous. Neither could the convicts have supplied their extensive mines. It is probable that the greater portion of their miners were purchased slavres. We are, in fact, informed that the workmen hi the Egyptian mines spoke different lan guages. To preArent conspiracies and escapes, the different gangs were placed under overseers who were not their countrymen, and all hope of flight was finally extinguished by fetters, by constant confinement in contracted caverns, and by the nature ofthe region itself, which offered no opportunity for successful escape. The lot of these unhappy crea tures iu the mines and furnaces Avas indeed a hard one. They were forced to labor day and night, without rest or hope, and under the most dreadful hardships and cruelties. They were entirely naked, and neither age nor sex, sickness nor wounds, excused them from the severity of dis cipline. The stronger ones hewed the rock in the mines, the half-grown youths carried the ore to the surface, persons over thirty years (so soon was their vigor destroyed) were set at the easier task of crushing it in mortars, and the women and old men ground it fine in hand-mills. The historian adds, with laconic pathos, that they continued to labor until they dropped dead beneath their burdens. Ancient mining in Siberia and Europe. \u2014 The far northern country of the"], [195, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 183 Massagetes is said by ancient writers to have produced gold and copper, but no silver nor iron. This is the nearest approach to a mention of min ing operations in Siberia Avhich history presents. But the observations of travellers, especially those recorded by Pallas, Lepechin, Gmelin, and Rytchkow,* afford convincing evidence of the existence of extensive Avorkings for gold and copper in Siberia, The tradition of the Russians, that these early miners Avere Scythians, is groundless. Tartars they were not, since they were unacquainted with irou, Avhich the former knew how to use. A nomadic race they are believed to have been, since no traces of buildings or masonry remain in those regions. All that we can con clude Avith probability is that, before the irruption of the Tartars into Siberia, very extensive but rude mining operations were carried on in that country by tribes not far removed in culture from the aborigines of North America . The tools which they employed were either of stone or copper \u2014 never, so far as has yet been discovered, of iron. The smelting of copper appears to have been successfully carried on, even with somewhat refractory ores. Traces of mining accidents, of the voluntary abandonment of very hard rocks, of great economy of labor in -' dead work,\" &c, taken together with the indications above mentioned of the social condition of this unknown people, prove to us that they carried on their mining operations by individual enterprise, as freemen, and probably without reference to particular ownership of the soil. Although this sjrstem (if system it may be called) stands in favorable contrast, on grounds of humanity, with the cruel and tyrannical prac tices connected with mining in the southern Orient, and especially in Egypt, yet it is eAident that its result was superficial exhaustion, aban donment, and finally burial in oblivion of the mines. From the very dawn of history, therefore, these two representative voices of Egypt and Siberia warn us that neither mining by the crown, nor nomadic, super ficial mining by the individual, is the true method of utilizing Avith econ omy the mineral resources of any country. The first is inconsistent with liberty, and the second with stable industry. Concerning the earliest beginnings of mining in Europe little can be said. The civilization of the East, as is well known, communicated itself first to the Mediterranean nations. As mining is an essential condition to the progress of civilization, so we may reasonably conjecture the pro gress of mining at any given period from the culture of the people. We are justified, therefore, in assuming that mining in Europe takes its rise with the emergence from barbarism of the Mediterranean tribes. Strabo, Pliny, and Herodotus declare that Cadmus, a Ph\u0153nician, opened the first gold and copper mines iu Thrace \u2014 a statement Avhich is philosophi cally, if not historically, true. The Ph\u0153nicians certainly carried on min ing in the islands of the Mediterranean, and even along the coast of dis tant Spain. But it is not probable that their operations contributed much to the spread of the art among the barbarians ; since they not only, with characteristic selfishness, carried aAvay all the products of their industry to enrich their own land, but kept to themselves whatever knoAvledge they acquired. They cannot be regarded as the teachers of European nations in this art \u2014 a credit which belongs rather to fugitives and exiles from other parts of Asia, who opened mines, or communicated the knowledge of mining, in the regions where they took refuge. The nature of the laws or customs regulating mining differed, therefore, according to the source of the art. The labors of the Ph\u0153nicians seem to have derived extent and comparative permanence from the conserva tive influence of commerce rather than tyranny. * The treatise of Pallas is found in Actis Soe. Imp. 1780, published at St. Petersburg, 1784 ; and that of Rytchkow in Busching's Magazine, part 8."], [196, "184 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. Mining in Greece.\u2014 The mining Avorks of ancient Greece are remark- able for extent, antiquity, and improved arrangement. The Greeks mined in the mother country aud in their eastern and Avestern colonies, and maintained through many centuries this industry, improving it by their own experience, and even studying it by scientific methods. The works of Theophrastus and Philo on metals are unfortunately lost, as is that of Strabo on machines and methods of parting metals. The remains of Greek mines are too nearly obliterated to afford us any evidence. We must learn Avhat we can from incidental passages in Greek literature, aud these refer almost entirely to the mines of Attica. The history of Greek mining may be divided iuto three periods. The first includes the activity of the mines upon the islands, the oldest of which belonged to the Ph\u0153nicians; the second period comprises the operations ofthe Greeks themselves, on the main land; and the third is characterized by the Avorking of new and productive mines in the proA*- inces of the Macedonian Philip, Avhich finally, Avith the rest of the Greek mines, fell into the hands of the Romans. The operations of the first period must be mainly inferred from passages in the Iliad and Odyssey ; aud these are of course to be interpreted Avith due allowance for their poetic form. When it is said that Helios, or the sun, iiiA-ented gold, and the mythical, not to say allegorical, Erycthonius discovered silver, while copper was brought to light by the inArestigatious of workmen directed by the gods, we may infer that the order in Avhich these metals became known to the Greeks was similar to that which, as we haAe already seen, obtains in the history of other peoples. Iron is said by an old Greek inscription to have been discovered at a period corresponding to 1431 B. C. of our calendar. These gleams of early history help us to under- stand how gold and sihrer, more than any other metals, have come to be considered the property of sovereigns. They Avere the earliest known, and that at a time when sovereigns took all they could get and could get almost anything they Avanted. Homer's descriptions of the magnifi- cence of Greek princes, if we may interpret them as historical, indicate no small surplus of gold and silver in Greece. It is to be remembered, however, that in the absence of that diffusive action which commerce maintains, and of that great demand for the precious metals to which their use as currency gives rise, the accumulation in a few hands of a comparatively small amount of gold and silver might Avell justify the glowing descriptions of Homer; and also that if the rich men of the present day were to spend their wealth, not on the means of comfort and enjoyment, not on books and works of art, not on public improvements, but ouly on plate, armor, jewelry, and chariots, they could far outshine the splendor of Homeric heroes. The islands in Avhich the Greeks carried on mining operations included Crete, (iron,) Thasos, (gold,) Eub\u0153a, (iron and copper,) Cyprus, (gold, silver, copper, andiron,) Delos, (copper,) Rhodes, (copper, iron, and lead,) Milo, (alum and sulphur,) Seriphos, (irou,) and Siphnos, (hoav Siphauto, very rich gold and silver mines.) From the mines of the latter island \u2022one-tenth of the product was sent every year to the shrine of Delphi. In later times, this payment having been discontinued, the mines Avere drowned by the rising of the neighboring sea ; and this disaster was .ascribed to the wrath of Apollo at being deprived of his divine royalty ! In addition to these mines upon the eastern islands, there were others, probably of later origin, upou the islands near Italy. Pithecusa, oppo j_ite Cuma, was rich iu gold; Sicily and the Liparian Islands were also famous for various ores. The petty rulers of the islands were the only or principal owners of"], [197, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 185 the mines, and the labor was doubtless performed by slaves, according to rude and simple methods. The second period of Greek mining, comprising the operations on the mainland, in Greece proper, is better known and more important. The Spartans, under the influence of then* political system, established no important industry of this, or, indeed, of any kind; but the Athenians became distinguished in the administration of the rich silver mines of Attica, and the productive colonial gold mines iu Thrace and Thasos. Thes saly had also rich gold ores, B\u0153otia produced iron, and Epirus possessed miues of silver. These resources seem to have been developed about the time of the Persian Avar. The public revenue from the Attic mines at the beginning of that war Avas equivalent to about $30,000, and after wards increased to much larger sums, which, together with the product of the colonial mines, had a great deal to do with the splendor and power of Athens. The unhappy Peloponnesian war put an end to Athenian mining. In vain Xenophon exhorted his countrymen to reopen the sources of their former prosperity, and prophesied the continuance in depth of the rich ores they had once so successfully worked. The pov erty of the citizens, and the exhaustion (in spite of Xenophon) of the mines, were obstacles which could not be overcome. Neither, as we shall see, was the system of the Athenians favorable to the persistent working- of mines under discouragement. We majT take leaAe to doubt, at the present day, whether the mineral deposits of Attica are really exhausted ; but at that time a temporary barrenness was equivalent to a oomplete failure. For nothing can carry forward such an industry over its periodical seasons of depression except despotic power on the one hand, or on the other hand that faith in the future Avhich is the result of accumulated experience, called science; and the Athenians had neither of these. Their failure in mining was due to the same cause as their failure in political science ; there was no education of the people to take the place of centralized powers The administration of the Athenian and that of the Egyptian mines differed as Avidely as did the political systems of the tAvo countries. The State indeed appears to havTe held a certain title to the minerals, but its rights did not extend to absolute possession, or at least were not strictly insisted upon. Before the Persian war the income of the mines was annually distributed among the citizens, from which we may conclude that the republic either mined for itself or leased its mineral lands. After that Avar, howeA\u00e6r, this distribution of profits was discontinued on the advice of Themistocles, although the State still received payments from the mines. It is not improbable that certain mines, especially ancient ones, were rented on special terms, as the property of the repub lic ; but the general practice w*as adopted of encouraging the develop ment of mineral resources by a liberal and universal code. Taxes on gross production were remitted ; citizens and friendly aliens alike were encouraged to mine under the light royalty of one twenty-fourth part of the net profits. The number of private adventurers thus encouraged to mining enterprise must have been very great. Even Demosthenes, in whose day Athenian mining was already on the wane, speaks of them as a class, like farmers and merchants.* The labor was performed by slaves, hired from their owners. The overseers were also slaves skilled in min ing. It is probable that in many cases the lessees themselves were slaves, as it was not uncommon in Athens for masters to lease to their slaves factories, Avorkshops, and farms. In such leases the slave-super intendent usually paid a daily net sum per capita for the number of *Demosth. adv. Anstocratetu."], [198, "186 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. laborers employed. The owner of slaves employed in mining receiA^ed daily one oboliis for each. The lessee was responsible for the food and clothing, and, in case of flight, for the value of the slaves \u2014 possibly also for their lives. No doubt this was a much milder slavery than that of the Egyptians, yet, as the slaA^es were strictly watched and ahvays kept in fetters, it. was oppressive enough. Slave-labor must always be lack ing in individual skill and zeal, and make up for this deficiency by in creased numbers. Accordingly we find that the slave-miners of Athens amounted to many thousands, or, as Athen\u0153us says, to myriads. His tory speaks of a miners' revolt, in which the insurgent slaves took pos session of Mount Sunium, and from that point made many destructive raids upon the Attic realm. The extent to which the republic attempted to prevent such perils by laws, regulating the number of laborers in each mine, or to control in general the operations of lessees, is unknown. That a certain goA\u00e6rnmental supervision was exercised appears from the fact that a director of mines Avas appointed, who indicated to adventurers, upon application, where they might prospect for ore, and that there were laws to determine the methods of mining, aud the location, direc tion, and extent of veins, as well as the proper distance between differ ent claims upon this same field. Ancient mining in western Europe. \u2014 Before the time of the Roman dominion, mining was carried on in many parts of western Europe; and although there are little or no traces left of the laws Avhich regu lated the industry of the barbarians, I shall briefly mention the locali ties referred to, partly to complete this historical outline, and partly because the mining jurisprudence of the Romans, like their mining sci ence, Avas affected by their conquest of those countries where the natives already practiced this art. The Etruscans and the Sabines, in Italy, were acquainted with the use of copper, and the former made early discov\u00e6ry of iron on the neigh boring island of Elba, the specular ores of Avhich are famous to this day. The Salassians, in Lombardy, turned the Po into canals, and established extensive washings for gold. The region of the Taurisci and Norici was rich in gold, and at one time the natives invited laborers from tbe south to assist them in its production ; but the result was an over stocked market, and a fall of one-third in the v-alue of gold, Avhich caused them to send home their laborers and reduce production to maintain the price. The tribes of Gaul obtained gold, silATer, copper, and iron. But Spain exceeded in its treasures of gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, and iron all the countries of the ancient world. The barbarian natives obtained these metals from superficial deposits or outcrops, and the Ph\u0153nicians and Carthagenians, and aftenvards the Romans, extracted them by deep mining. In fact, the art itself was planted in Spain by these foreign nations. The mere use of surface deposits can no more be called mining than the gathering of bunch-grass and pine nuts by our Nevada Indians can be called agriculture. Probably the Ph\u0153nicians themselves, in their distant operations in Spain and Britain, engaged rather in commerce than mining, buying the metals of the bar barians. But the Carthagenians, we know, established in Spain and Sardinia most extensive and productive mines, the revenue of Avhich enabled them to support a numerous army of mercenaries and to Avage long and costly Avars with Rome. No doubt these mines were iu some form the property of the state. The British islands Avere the scene of a considerable native industry, comprising gold, sihTer, iron, copper, lead, and tin. Strange to say, the Britons seem to have lacked or despised the art of manufacturing copper, though they practiced the more diffi-"], [199, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 187 cult metallurgy of iron. The Ph\u0153nicians traded with them secretly for tin, and the Romans, by following the Ph\u0153nician ships, finally discov- ered the mystery of the Cassiterides. But the Britons continued, until their conquest by C\u00e6sar, to work their own mines of lead and tin. The tin of Cornwall Avas shipped first to the Isle of Wight, and thence to the coast of Gaul, where it Avas loaded upon horses and transported to Marseilles \u2014 a journey of 30 days. Mining of the Romans \u2014 Almost all the nations celebrated for their mines in ancient times became at last the prey of the Romans ; and Roman mining was therefore a very wide-spread industry. Our knowl- edge concerning it is, however, mainly confined to Europe ; since neither the hints of classical writers nor the observations of modern travellers have thrown much light on the Roman mines in Asia and Africa. The poverty of the early Romans indicates that they did not work the mines of their native land. They struck the first silver coins shortly before the first Punic Avar, Avhen, by rapid conquests in middle and lower Italy, they acquired mines Avhich furnished them the means to greater undertakings. The wars against Carthage made Rome mighty among nations, and eminent in the history of mining. The first two Punic wars delivered into her power the important mines of Sardinia, Sicdy, and Spain. Oriental conquests added mines in Asia Minor, Greece, and Macedonia, and at a subsequent period the remaining mines of the east, in Asia and in Egypt, were acquired by the victorious arms of Pompey and Augustus, and those of northern Spain and Gaul yielded to the legions of the C\u00e6sars. The tin mines of Britain were their latest conquest of this sort ; and after these had been gained Rome was mis- tress of all the important mines of the ancient world, and gathered into her coffers the wealth which had before been the strength and glory of many different nations. As the mines had been acquired by conquest, they became the prop- erty, not of private citizens, but of the republic, and afterwards of the empire. In the period after the first Punic war the revenues of the republic were collected, indirectly, through contractors ; and the censor, to whom belonged the duty of farming out the finances, awarded at cer- tain times the leases of the mines. Ordinarily, as for instance in upper Italy and Spain, the lessees worked their ground Avith purchased slaAes. Iu a few districts, hoAveA'er, the native inhabitants Avere held to a certain amount of labor in mines and furnaces, as a sort of vassalage, like that of the crown-serfs of Russia a few years ago, and this crown-right over their services was granted to the lessees of' the mines. The treatment of the slaves was not less inhuman than that practiced by the Egyptians. Diodorus describes both in nearly the same language. The increased money value of a slave among the Romans might indeed have caused some amelioration of his condition for the sake of prolonging his life ; but probabby this was lost sight of in view of the immediate profit derived from the rapid and reckless robbery of the mines. It was the swift exhaustion and waste of their mineral resources, and not any con- siderations of humanity towards barbarians, which led the Romans to change their policy of leasing the mines. From an economical point of view no system of mining could have been more injurious to the state. The lessees cared nothing for the future ; they took no pains to utdize all the treasure in the earth ; they were absorbed in the endeavor to realize as much profit as possible during their limited term of posses- sion, and to this end they employed vast armies of slaves and ruthlessly laid waste the mining lands. Polybius says that the lessees of a single district in Spain employed in their mines no less than 40,000 purchased"], [200, "188 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. slaA-es : and this evil grew to such a size in the gold mines of upper Italy that the censor, in order to delay the exhaustion of the mines and pre vent the sudden depreciation of the precious metals, made it a condition of lease that the number of laborers in those mines should not exceed a certain limit. Of course under these circumstances the art of mining made no progress. The Romans took it as they found it among the con quered nations, and rather fell behind their teachers than surpassed them. The system of Egypt, bad as it was, was better than this. The selfishness os' despotism was at least more provident than the indiffer ence of democracy. The period from the first Punic war to the empire was characterized by an immense production of metals, and ended with the exhaustion of many of the mines. The despotic emperors took the matter in baud, and, though the past could not be repaired, they reformed the causes of the evil. They began to work the mines through regularly appointed officials, instead of leasing them to unscrupulous speculators ; and as it was not feasible for the government to obtain so many slaves as had previously been employed by private parties, the system of feudal service from the inhabitants was gradually extended, and the oppression of the former irresponsible administrations was lightened. The crown serfs, so to speak, Avere allowed to own and to sell land, but the purchaser acquired, together Avith the property, the obligations of service resting upon the former owner. Slaves were also employed, but these were rather condemned convicts than purchased barbarians or captives of war. The emperors seem to have preferred to apply this system to the main tenance of mines already open, and to have willingly allowed private adventurers to discoATer and explore new ones. Thus Trajan allowed the Dacian gold mines to be worked by a sort of stock company, (collegium aurariorum,) and Valentinian I. gaAre free permission to prospect for metals on payment of a portion of the subsequent products. Instances are mentioned of priATate persons owning large and profitable mines, probably by special grant. A new impulse was thus given to mining, and gold mines Avere opened during the first hundred years of the empire in Dalmatia, Illyria, and Dacia. The supervision of this vast industry required numerous officials, of whom the names only are left to us, such as Comes metallorum, the Comes sacrarum largUionum, the Comes Orientis, the Vicarii, and Rationales. Probably their duties were chiefly of a financial or magisterial nature, although the Comes metallorum may have been a sort of mining engineer. But agencies came into play which overpowered the good influence of the new system. The errors of the past were, to a great extent, irre mediable ; the impoverished mines could not compete with others more favorably situated ; and finally the irruptions of the barbarians ou the borders disturbed or destroyed the industry of many districts. The serf laborers were quite as likely to join the invaders as to defend the mines against them. From the silence of the later historians Ave may infer that mining in the Roman empire declined rapidly after the third cen tury; and after the fifth century, when the barbarian hordes over whelmed with successiA'e invasions the tottering empire of the west, it ceased entirely. The Byzantines maintained it a little longer, but after the seventh century they gradually surrendered their mines to the conquering Arabs. The mines of Asia Minor, Thrace, and Greece were the last which the empire retained. The victorious barbarians no doubt gleaned Avhat they could from the abandoned works of their predecessors. This was done, we know, by the Arabs in Spain, the Franks in Gaul, and the Goths under Theodoric in Italy. But we have no record of their manner of operation, nor can we say in what way the mining of medi\u00e6val"], [201, "189 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. times grew out of this ruin of ancient mining. There is a chasm of centimes not bridged by historic records. It is scarcely necessary for me to trace the evident parallel between the histories of Roman and American mining. The Romans, by an inju dicious system of administration, plundered and wasted the then availa ble resources of the known world; and when they awoke to the extent of the mischief it was too late to repair it. The system of indiscriminate free mining, permitted in this country for the last few years, though out wardly unlike the farming out of the Roman mines, possesses the same fatal evil. The mines are worked by those who have but a temporary interest in them, and do not hesitate to rob them for present gain, thus wasting the resources of the State. \u2022 In ancient times, only despotism could cure such evils ; but I am one of those who believe that freedom has means not less effectiATe for reform, and I hope to establish on a firm historical, as well as philosophical basis, the propositions which I shall, in the present report, recommend as the true foundation for a democratic jurisprudence of mines. CHAPTER XXIV. MINING LAW IN THE MIDDLE AGES. Mining is the only industry which extends its activity into the earth's interior.* The accidental boundaries which topography or commerce may give to landed estates can scarcely be tlie limits for the extent of underground work, which is rather controlled by the dimensions of sub terranean mineral deposits. Mining was therefore even in prehistoric times already separated, as an independent industry, from other exploit ations of the soil. It is carried ou neither within the same boundaries nor by the same persons as agriculture. Under the influence of this dis tinction peculiar legal relations were established in Germany at a very early day, probably at the commencement of systematic mining, which have for their subject the subterranean deposits, and are not dependent upou the ordinary laws of property. In the form of a local custom, ob taining with remarkable uniformity in all the original centres of German mining, the principle of mining freedom (Bergbaiifreiheit) established it self, permitting all persons to search for useful minerals, and granting to the discoverer of such a deposit the rights of property within certain limits. This principle of free mining emigrated with the German miners to all places whither their enterprise extended itself, and the original local custom became the general law. In this existence of an estate in minerals, entirely independent of the estate in soil, lies the distinctive character of German mining law. It is eminently a special law, not subordinate to the civil law, but co-ordinate with it. Its rules and max ims are self-created, and based upon its own peculiar experience. Where the miniug freedom of which we have spoken does not exist, where the owner of the soil possesses, as iu England, the exclusive right to the minerals contained in it, there can be no such thing as a distinct mining law. The Eoman law gave, as a rule, the mineral right to the land owner ; but the opposite principle seems to have sprung up spontaneously in * For a more elaborate discussion, see, among other works, the admirable commentary on the new mining law of Prussia, by Councillor R. Klostermann, from whose introduction the first paragraphs of this section are substantially borrowed."], [202, "190 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING Germanv. The earliest record of the German custom is the mining treaty between Bishop Albrecht, of Trent, and the miners immigrating from Germany to that locality, bearing date March 24, 1185. In 1208 the mining customs were officially announced in Trent. The formation of the Iglau code in Moravia took place about 1250, and this system was rapidly extended through Bohemia also. The Schemnitz law in Hungary was formed somewhat later, but coincides exactly Avith that of Iglau. The code of Freiberg, in Saxony, was probably brought from the Harz, since Freiberg was first settled by Goslar miners. Its publication took place in the 14th century. The mining regulations of Massa, in Tus cany, date from the middle of the 13th century. The uniformity of these laws is striking, and extends uot only to the common principle of free mining, but to special provisions thereunder, and even to certain formulated maxims, which lead us irresistibly to the conclusion that they have in the transmitted habits and traditions of wandering miners their common origin. This origin was much earlier than the records above cited. Mining is known to have been carried on by the Germans at Andreasberg, in the Harz, since anno Domini 908. The famous Rammelsberg mines at Goslar were discovered anno Domini 972 by the pawing of a steed, named Ram mel, tied to a tree in the forest. Before the return of the master the horse had \" developed\" a promising vein of ore, and the mountain was baptized in his honor. The Freiberg district was discovered about lltJo, by a teamster of Goslar, who picked up a rich specimen of ore while passing through the then unpopulated region. A stampede of miners from Goslar, and the opening of many valuable mines, was the result. Since 1547 the mines of Freiberg have been steadily producing. The mines of St. Annaberg were discovered by one Daniel, said to have been guided by a celestial flame. The mines of Schneeberg were found about 1470 by a spice pedlar from Zwickau, who, travelling by this moun tain, noticed a discoloration of the soil, and set some laborers at work. In 1477 the great mass of native silver was found at Schneeberg, and hon ored by the elector Ernest, who used it on a memorable occasion as a dining table. It was a slab nearly a foot thick, and about 12 feet long by 6 broad. When it was melted, it yielded some 20 tons of silver. The mines of Marienberg date from 1521, and those of Mansfeld, which are still prosperous, from 1199. But older than any of these is Hunga rian mining, which can be traced as far back as A. D. 750. Reitemaier* says the German mines were undeniably opened by miners from Gaul ; but I think it fair to conjecture from the great antiquity of Hungarian mining, that there was also a direct current of progress from the east, perhaps not unconnected Avith those operations of the tribes of the Danube to which allusion Avas made in a previous chapter. Whatever mining the Gauls did Avas done under Roman law, and certainly there is no trace of that law in the history of German mining. In this case, as in many others, the tide of Latin ideas broke in vain upon the rock.y Saxou char acter, and retreating left no marks but such as time speedily erased. The earliest records of mining law in the middle ages do not create, they only recognize and establish, the customs Avhich were even then already old. If the source of these customs is lost in obscurity, so also is their gradual development ; for, as I have said, the earliest publication of them Avas made in Trent \u2014 in other words, in a foreign laud, Avhere they came into collision with existing systems. Of their peaceful growth at home we have no trace. They suddenly appear in history, adult and strong. But they soon met with opposition and modification at home, * Geschichte des Bergbaucs, etc. bci den Allen I'Olkern, p. 150."], [203, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 191 where the emperor and the territorial sovereigns laid claim, at the end of the 12th century, to the mining royalty. The German mining law is a product of this antagonism \u2014 a compound of mining freedom with mining royalty\u2014 (Bergfreiheit und Berg-regal.) The contest between the two principles occupied part of the 13th and 14th centuries. It was the south against the north, Egypt against Siberia.* The proud dynasty of Hohenstaufen began the war. Frederick I claimed the mines'of Trent as imperial royalties, (regalia,) and forced the bishop to accept a lease of them. The mines themselves were not interfered with. All that the emperor desired was a recognition of his prerogative, as a support to future claims ; and, in general, the struggle of the German emperors for the royalty of mines was prompted, not by their desire to appro- priate and work them, but by their claim of the right to levy on min- ing imperial taxes, independently of the different legislatures and sovereigns of the empire. Meanwhile, the territorial rulers saw their advantage in promptly adopting and employing for their own interest the theory of royalty, and finally the owners of the soil made themselves heard, and obtained a certain recognition of their claims to some non-pre- cious metals. During this conflict of ideas contradictory principles were proclaimed by different parties ; and the thirteenth century presents a scene of confusion and uncertainty as to the relations of emperor, prince, landlord,and miner. The famous \"Golden Bull \"of Emperor Charles IV, dated January 9, 1356, simplified the contest by excluding from it two of the conflicting parties. That emperor was more inclined to augment his hereditary power as a Bohemian prince than to increase the prerogatives of his imperial authority, which would pass to some other German sovereign after his death. He therefore, in the imperial la av referred to, surren- dered the claims of the emperor in favor of the electors ; and in fact the result of this partial surrender was the actual exercise of mining royalty by all the other sovereigns, as well as the electors. But the Golden Bull excluded .also the land owner, putting all metals, precious and base, together with salines, under one rule, namely, the right of the territorial sovereign. Two forces were now left face to face, the royalty of the princes, recognized by the emperor, and the principle of free mining, already repeatedly recognized to a greater or less extent by the princes themselves. The relations of these two forces were not determined by the Golden Bull, which left the princes free to enforce their claims as far as they had already done so, or might be able to do so in future. The issue of the conflict, thus left to time, was different in different states; but the essential victory remained with the miners. The princes recog- nized the right of free prospecting and the right of the discoverer to the mineral deposit discovered, reserving to themselves only the usual trib- ute (finally the tithe) and the rights of police and magisterial jurisdiction. But although mining freedom thus obtained practical recognition, the rights of the sovereigns were exercised in exceptional cases in opposition to this principle. Mines and whole mining districts were granted with- out reference to the discovery ; and the occasional feature of special grants was accepted as a part of the jurisprudence of mines. The pro cedure necessary to obtain property in minerals also suffered a change. Mere occupation by the discoverer was no longer sufficient; he must \" denounce\" his claim, and obtain his lease from the prince or his dele gate \u2014 generally a regularly constituted office or court of mines, (Berg ami, Bergbehbrde.J The maxim was stdl preserved, \"The first tinder is * See remarks on Egyptian aud Siberian mining in a previous chapter."], [204, "192 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. the first claimant;\" but the greater weight was laid upon the \"denun ciation,\" (Muthung,) aud the right of the discoverer Avas forfeited if he failed within a brief period to make his discovery known in the appointed manner. The princes of different states made use of their power to ex tend and modify existing regulations, so that mining codes proper took the place ofthe mass of traditional usages which had accumulated through four centuries, and Avhich might have been called by partial analogy the common law of mines. German mining codes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. \u2014 One of the first steps taken by soA*ereigns to confirm by exercise their rights of royalty, was the endowment of certain cities and districts with peculiar privileges, on account of their mines. Turin aud Vallensasco, in Italy; Mont Saut, in Languedoc; Truro and Pensance, in Cornwall; the Isle of Wight ; Griinberg, Engelberg, aud Melchthal, in the canton of Uiiter- Avalden; several iron mines iu the canton of Berne; the Black Erzberg, in the valley of Filisur ; Mount Guntzen, in the Alps; Goldberg, Reich stein, Zuckmantel, Kupferberg, and Gieren, in Silesia; Cremnitz, Schem nitz, Altsol, Neusol, Kouigsberg, Puggany, Tyller, and Eperies, in Hun gary; Smaland in Sweden; and Casan in Tartary, are examples of this practice outside of Germany. The mining cities of Germany were very* numerous. The Harz alone contained seven, which exist to this day, St. Andreasberg, Altenau, Clausthal, Zellerfeld, Grund, Lauteuthal, and Goslar. In Saxony, and particularly in the realm of the Counts of Meis sen, was the \"ancient and honorable free mining city\" of Freiberg, origi nally called Freistein, the origin of which is interesting- as an illustration of the history of the period. The Freiberg district, as I haA*e said, was discoATered about 1105 by a teamster of Goslar, (the locality of the famous Eammelsberg mines in the Brunswickian Harz,) and first settled by miners from that place. A few years after, Duke Otto of Brunswick quarrelled with his director of mines, (BergvogtJ and the latter, to revenge himself, marched to Saxony with all his workmen. They Avere joyfully welcomed by the Margrave, who not only granted them extraordinary privileges, but also, for the protection of the Freiberg minesin those uncertain times, surrounded them in 1176 with walls, and built the castle of Freistein in the midst of them. Saxony has many other mining cities, among which may be named St. Annaberg, Schneeberg, St. Georgen stadt, Schwarzenberg, Marienberg, localities of silver mining, and Alten berg, Eibenstock, Scheibenberg, Wolkenstein, and Ehrenfriedersdorf, localities of iron and tin mining. Arensberg at Cologne, aud the copper mines of Riegelsdorf in Hesse, are also mentioned among the privfleged mink) g districts. Watering-places were generally favored also, as appears from the following passage in au old essay on mining royalty* : Regarding mineral springs, hot and metallic baths, it is not considered that a great prince should make a royalty of them, or demand of the guests at such places any payment for their use. For Almighty God did not cause these springs to flow for the sake of princes and rich people only, but also, and perhaps chiefly, for the healing of the poor. And it is to be feared that they may dry up, if this gift is abused, as indeed was the case with the Griesbacb, not far from Strasburg, the water of which disappeared when a certain duty was imposed upon the spring, but reappeared again as soon as the duty was removed. For this reason the Emperor, Charles IV, granted a privilege to the Wildbad of the Canton Berne, if a prince, however, should tax lightly the guests at any spa and use the money for their benefit, as, for instance, in the erection ot a church in that place, he may not be reproved. The principal German mining codes (BergordnungenJ of this period are those of Electoral Saxony, Cremnitz and Schemnitz in Hungary, Treves, Joachimsthal, Brunswick-Liineberg, Zohustein, &c. There is also a Danish mining code, and a good statement of general principles in the celebrated Avork of Agricola, De Re Metallica, It Avould be scarcely profitable at this time to review these different systems in detail,"], [205, "193 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. or to burden the general description which I propose to give with con stant references to particular sources of information. It will be quite sufficient for my purpose to present a picture of those features in Avhich the codes of this period substantially agree, in order to show the general nature of the system Avhich obtained throughout middle Europe during the period of \"paternal government\" \u2014 a period Avhen political economy was imperfectly understood, and the doctrine that sovereigns might interfere for their own private ends with individual industry was replaced by the notion that governments ought to regulate for the general good all the affairs of the people. It Avas principally the flow of precious metals, and afterwards of other products, from America to Europe which brought the industrial prob lem of the sixteenth and seventeenth century, and placed commerce in antagonism with the hitherto accepted maxims of government. At the end of the fifteenth century the ATalue of the precious metals in Europe reached its maximum. The price of grain in 1494 was only half as much as in 1399 ; but it rose in tbe sixteenth century (or in other words gold fell) to three times, and in the seventeenth century to fiA*e times, the price of 1494. The effect of this change on mining was disastrous; and the arbitrary measures taken, in accordance with the spirit of the age, to abate the evil, of course failed of their intended effect. It must be remembered that at this time the laws regulating the guilds prescribed precisely how many masters, journeymen and apprentices there should be in every trade and what Avares they might or might not produce; workmen were not allowed to labor outside of their proper city ; heavy penalties attended the importation of any article which, in the opinion of the guilds, could as well be manufactured at home. It is not surpris ing that mining also was administered by the state under a bureaucratic system, and on false notions of political economy. It is amusing to read that in one instance the increase of the number of coal mines was for bidden, lest the expense of so many deep workings should raise the price of coal, while at the same time the owners of mines nearest the market were prevented from working, because it would not be fair to those Avhose mines lay further away ! Iu spite of such follies as these, how ever, there grew up an elaborate and in many respects very wise system of administration, much of which has remained to the present day, and is well worthy to be studied. A scheme of the organization of this industry would be something like the following : 1. The sovereign. 2. The director of mines, (Berghauptmann.) This officer represents the government, and is the highest authority. There may be more than one in the same state if it is a large one. Prussia recently had five, besides one chief director of mines, who was at the same time a sort of minister without a vote ( Vortragender Rath J iu the royal cabinet. 3. Mining councillor (Bergrath.J These are inspecting and consulting officers, who make periodical tours through the districts under their charge, and report to their superior. The director of mines and the councillors include within their duties also the administration of smelt ing Avorks ; but all ranks below them are restricted to one or the other department. 4. Master of mines, master of furnaces, (Bergmeister, Hiittenmeister.) This officer has charge of a single district, and inspects Aveekly. 5. Sworn inspectors of mines or of furnaces, ( Berggeschworene, Poch geschtvorene.) These officers inspect daily. 6. SurA*eyor, (Markscheider.J H. Ex. Doc. 54 13"], [206, "194 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. These six grades must be filled by men of thorough education as well as experience. 7. Captains and foremen, ( Bergsteiger,Pochstciger, Unter steiger.) These officers may or may not be graduates of schools. They are chosen for their faithfulness and practical ability, and are constantly under the supervision of the various inspecting engineers. 8. At the smelting works there are assayers, counter- assayers, &c, and there is a paymaster ( ' Schichtmeister ) elected by the miners and con- firmed by the mining court, who takes charge ofthe accounts of several mines at once. This is an outline of the system which still prevails substantially in Germany. I am far from recommending, as the sequel will show, tbe adoption of such a plan by the American government; but mining com- panies in different districts would be greatly benefited if by free and voluntary association they could effect a similar cheap and effective administration. Under such a system the whole mining enterprise of the Comstock lode could have been superintended by the ablest men in the country at one-quarter the expense which has been incurred under the multiplied administrations of different companies.* As I have said, great weight is laid, in the ancient codes, upon the denunciation of claims. Prospecting seems to have been in most cases unhindered. Says a German writer: Here occurs the question whether a private person has any right to dig for and mine metals on the ground of another. A doubtful question a priori, since \" no one may go a-hunting on another's land.\" It is also forbidden for any one to seek treasure on the land of another, and we might naturally suppose gold and silver mines to be meant; nevertheless the con- trary is declared, in view of the general benefit from the production of metals, aud the par- ticular advantage of the royalty to the coffers of the state. This freedom of prospecting was, however, limited so far that the foundations of buildings must not be injured, aud all damages done to the surface or to agriculture must be paid. The discovery of a vein must be immediately made known to the master of mines by a denuncia- tion, either written, or, if oral, then followed within three hours with a written one. The master of mines must see that the first discoverer is not cheated of his rights. He also exercises a general authority over all the prospecting work, and when the vein is actually exposed, he issues upon the denunciation aforesaid a permit to work it, (Muthzettel, Mulh- schein.) No such permit can be issued unless the denunciation contains an accurate description of the locality of the vein ; until such a definite statement is possible the work proceeds merely as prospecting. After the permit is issued, the miner may go on until he has developed the true dip and course of the vein and opened it to a sufficient depth to require \" bucket and rope \" for his operations. At this point the master of mines orders a survey and location of the field, which is then regularly leased to the holder of the preliminary permit. Denunciations of placers (self en) may also be received, but the master must then visit the place in com pany with the royal gamekeeper and forester, and satisfy himself that the proposed operations will not be hurtful to timber, game, irrigating or draining canals, etc., when he may give a license for placer mining. This license, however, he may revoke at any time; and if wilful damage is done in these respects by the placer miners, he may not only eject them, but hold them for the repair of the said damage, and even proceed, if required, to punish them for the wrong committed. The erection of stamp-mills, etc., he may authorize, if not to the injury of others already erected. All mining leases require the work to be continuously prose cuted. Parties engaged in making preparatory shafts aud tunnels are * See chapter on Comstock mines, in this report."], [207, "195 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. allowed no interval, unless they are miners at work part of the time else- Avhere. This provision was evidently intended to encourage prospecting by the workmen in their leisure hours, and to give them a chance to become mine owners on their own account; but at the same time to pre vent capitalists from commencing work and then dropping it, while con tinuing to claim such rights as would exclude other adventurers. After the mines are open and ore is struck, the making of the survey aud appli cation for a lease is peremptory, and when the lease is once issued, cer tain delays, caused by natural necessity, are to be permitted ; foul air or much water are good excuses. The longest interval of idleness, however, must not exceed one quarter for silver and tAvo quarters for base metals. Other claimants offering at any time during such an interval, \" time is called \" upon the idle lessees, and they must presently resume operations or lose the lease, which may then be issued, upon new denunciation, to others. Parties receiving permits to reopen abandoned mines are not obliged to specify the vein or veins they will work, but must report them and take leases upon them as soon as they are discovered. Leases were generally subject to the royalty, usually 1-10 or 1-20 of gross product, paid to the soA*ereigu. Where the mines were upon pri vate lands, the landlord received a second tithe in lieu of damages. It was common also to giA*e the Elector, \"by ancient usage,\" one-eighth of the stock in every leased mine. This he retained, liable to the same assessments as any other stockholder, and if he at any time declined to pay his share of assessments his stock Avas forfeit. Poor mines, and in many cases iron mines, were freed from the oppressive tithe. Yet the coal mines were frequently held subject to the metallic royalty. The Counts of Schaumburg are said to have derived as much revenue, from coal as other princes from silver. In Holland and Lower Saxony, even peat was laid under royalty, and it was not uncommon to include the manufacture of saltpetre iu the same category. Mining leases covered a certain area of the surface and a space below the surface, either bounded by A-ertical planes or by surfaces parallel with the dip of the vein. The first Avas called a square location, (gevierdtfeld,) and the second an inclined location, (gestrecktfeld.) The practice of folloAving to any distance outside of the veiu leased the \"dips, spurs, and angles,\" was unknown; and I am unable to discover any traces of it iu ancient or modern times except in the mining customs of this country. The possessor of an inclined location Avas generally allowed to work about 30 feet in the hanging wall, and the same dis tance beloAv the foot wall, ( Vierung, viertehalb Ladder ins Hangende, und viertehalb Lachter -ins Liegende.) Within these bmits all the ore discovered might be extracted by the lessee. In case of veins crossing the elder location took precedence, but could ouly maintain the right to a zone of 30 feet on each side of its vein. In cases of doubtful contro versy the matter was compromised by a union of the two mines. The simple square location was applied to beds, masses, and even to true veins, when they possessed a dip of not more than 15\u00b0 beloAv the hori zontal plane. The size of this kind of location varied Avith the locality and the circumstances, such as the number of associates or stockholders, etc. A frequent size seems to have been about 200 feet square, with the discovery shaft in the centre. The length of a claim upon a vein was also variable. In Freiberg, I believe, 401) feet were allowed ; in Hun gary 200, and elsewhere,' ordinarily, 300. According to the general rule, the discovery shaft stood in the middle of the claim. A mine was generally divided into 128 shares, (Kuxe,) which might be held by one man, if he could afford it; but such was scarcely ever the case. Au old"], [208, "196 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. authority says \" a silver mine needs 32 stockholders, a copper mine 16, and a tin mine 8.\" Wood for timbering w*as furnished, when possible, by the royal for ester. Where there were no croAvnN lands and forests, the companies must agree with the OAvners of timber, and it was the duty of the master to presen\u00e6 harmony and fair play between the two interests. The mines were mostly worked under contracts with the laborers, and the price per foot or fathom (Lachter) was fixed by the master and sworn inspector, according to the varying hardness of rock and difficulty and danger of the work. The driving of adits or deep tunnels was the privilege of the prince, but it Avas almost universally permitted, under certain regulations, to private parties. There were peculiar rights connected with such a work. One was the tunnel-right, (Stollenhieb,)' entitling the lessee to all ores found Avithin about eight feet (5 Viertellachter) above the water level of the tunnel, and for a distance of two feet on either side. The second right was the tunnel-royalty, (Stollengerechtigkeit,) entitling the tunneller to one ninth of the profits of any mine drained and ventilated by his tunnel. To gain this, however, the tunnel must really and effectively drain and Arentilate ; and this royalty might be taken away by the opening of a deeper tunnel, which thus acquired the right to one-ninth the mining profits. In order to gain either of these priAileges a tunnel must be a certain distance \" under grass\" \u2014 in Saxony 70 feet, and in some states as much as 120. A new tunnel, in order to be entitled to the royalty already enjoyed by an older one, must strike the mine at least 30 feet deeper. Special contracts were frequently made between tunnels and mines, by virtue of which, when the ninth was too onerous and the mine was in danger of failure, a loAver royalty was accepted. CHAPTER XXV. THE SPANISH MINING LAW. The essential features of this law w*ere giATeu in the first report of Hon. J. Ross Browne, (page 257,) and I shall only recapitulate a few important facts in regard to it, referring to that report and to the full compilation of Mr. Rockwell.* The royal ordinance of the King of Spain, published in 1783, has been ever since substantially in force in Mexico It asserts the right of sovereignty over all species of metal, and author izes the concession of mineral rights only while the mine is worked. It is also A*ery full in its directions as to the manner of mining, experience haAing shown that a mere temporary ownership of mines tends to a reckless and insecure method of exploitation. This law is remarkable for an attempt to reconcile the two systems of square aud inclined loca tions by an elaborate graduation of the size and shape of the surface claim according to the dip of the vein. Chapter VIII of the ordinance, containing this plan, deserves to be quoted. It runs as folloAvs : Section 1. Experience having shown that the equality of the mine measures established on the surface cannot be maintained under ground, where, in fact, the mines are chiefly valuable, it being certain that the greater or less inclination of the vein upon the plane of the horizon must render the respective properties in the mine greater or smaller, so that the true and effective impartiality which it has been desired to show towards all subjects of equal * A Compilation of Spanish and Mexican Law in Relation to Mines, &c, by J. A. Rock well, New York, 1851."], [209, "197 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. merit has not been preserved ; but, on the contrary, it has often happened that when a miner, after much expense and labor, begins at last to reach an abundant and rich ore he is obliged to turn back, as having entered on the property of another, which latter may have denounced the neighboring mine, and thus stationed himself with more art than industry \u2014 this being one of the greatest and most frequent causes of litigation aud dissension among the miners \u2014 and considering that ihe limits established in the mines of these kingdoms, and by which those of New Spain have been hitherto regulated, are very confined iu proportion to the abundance, multitude, and richness of the metallic veins which it has pleased the Creator of his great bounty to bestow on these regions, I order and command that in the mines where new veins, or veins unconnected with each other, shall be discovered, the following measures shall in future be observed : Sec 2. On the course and direction of the vein, whether gold, silver, or other metal, I grant to every miner, without any distinction in favor of the discoverer, whose reward has been specified,* 200 yards, taken on a level, as hitherto understood. Sec. 3. To make it what they call a square, that is, making a right angle with the preced ing measure, supposing the descent or inclination of the vein to be sufficiently shown by the opening or shaft of 10 yards, the portion shall be measured by the following rule : Sec. 4. Where the vein is perpendicular to the horizon, (a case which seldom occurs,) 100 level yards shall be measured on either side of the vein, or divided on both sides, as the miner may prefer. Sec. 5. But when the vein is inclined, (whicii is the most usual case,) its greater or less degree of inclination shall be attended to in the following manner: Sec. 6. If to one yard perpendicular the inclination be from three fingers to two palms,! the same hundred yards shall be allowed for the square, as in the case ofa vertical vein. Sec. 7. If to the said vertical yard there shall be a departure of \u2014 So that if to one vertical yard there correspond a departure of four palms, which are equal to a yard, the miner shall be allowed 200 yaids on the square of the declivity of the vein, and so on with the rest. Sec. 8. Aud supposing that in the prescribed manner any miner should reach the perpen dicular depth of 200 yards, by which he may commonly have much exhausted the vein, and that those veins which have greater inclinations than yard for yard, that is to say of 45 degrees, are either barren or of little extent, it is my sovereign will that although the declivity may be greater 9 than the above-mentioned measures, no one shall exceed the square ot 200 level yards, so ttrat the same shall always be the breadth of sclaim upon] the said veins by the length of 200 yards, as declared above. Sec 9. However, if any mine-owner, suspecting a vein to be run in a contrary direction to his own, (which rarely happens,) should choose to have some part of his square [laid off] in a direct iou opposire to that of his principal vein, it may be granted to him provided there shall be n . injury or prejudice to a third person thereby. SEC 10. [Provides that banks, beds, or other accidental depositories of gold or silver shall be apportioned into claims by the miners themselves, attention being paid to the richness of the place and to the number of applicants, aud preference given only to the discoverer. The government reserves the right to revise such local mining regulations so as to prevent unfair dealing.] \u00bb The reward of the discoverer (chap, iv, sees. 1 and 2) consists in three \"portions\" of the vein when in a mountain where no shaft nor mine has ever been opened before, and two portions when in a mouutaiu known and w.rked in other parts. This grant is condi tioned upon denunciation within 10 days, and, like all others, becomes void by tour months neglect to work the mines. t This corresponds to a \"dip,\" as now estimated by mining engineers, measured by the anode between the plane of the lode and that of the horizon, of 85\u00b0 25' to 63\u00b0 20 . In the followino- section I have added to each specification the dip in degrees, and also the depth in yards at which, according to this law, the vein, if it held a regular dip, would pass out ot the mining field into the neighboiiug one. JThe word \" inclination\" is the same as I have previously translated \"departure,\" and a .-.eater inclination than 45 degrees would be, iu modern phrase, a smaller one, that is, the veiu would dip less than 45 degrees below the horizon. See remarks on this section, below. \u00a7 Less. Amount of departure. Side of square allowed. Dip, in de- grees. Depth.

SEC 11. The portions being regulated in the manner described above, the denouncer [that is, each claimant] shall have his share measuied at the time of taking possession of the mine, and he shall erect around his boundaries stakes or landmarks, such as shall be. secure and easy to be distinguished, and enter into an obligation to keep and observe them forever, without being able to change them ; though he may allege that his vein varied in course or direction, (which is an unlikely circumstance;) but he must content himself with the lot which Providence decreed him, and enjoy it without disturbing his neighbors. If, however, he should have no neighbors, or if he can, without injury to his neighbors, make an improve ment by altering the stakes and boundaries, it may be permitted him in such case, with pre vious intervention, cognizance, and authority ofthe deputy of the district, who shall cite and hear the parties, and determine whether the causes for such encroachment are lesitimate. It is frequently said that the Spanish mining law is the best that was ever devised. It certainly is one of the most elaborate, and perhaps was Avell fitted to the knowledge and social conditions of tbe era when it was formed. But a careful study of it is sufficient to show that it is now antiquated. The chapter above quoted, for instance, is evidently based on two assumptions: first, that mineral A*eins A*ery seldom change their course and dip, and that an opening ten yards deep is enough to show what these characters are ; and second, that no mine can be profitably worked to a greater depth than 200 yards. The first of these assump tions is not justified by experience; and the second has long since been rendered obsolete by the steam-engine, deep tuunels, aud other appli ances of modern engineering. The Spanish system iu Mexico has cer tainly stimulated mining, after a fashion, in that country. The miues of Mexico have produced A*ast quantities of bullion, but a closer exami nation reveals that the art of mining itself has made little progress; the lack of permanent proprietorship has led to reckless robbery of mineral deposits; A*ery Aaluable A*eins haA*e been so unskilfully opened as to ren der deep workings impossible; the profits of mining have not been expended in permanent improvements, but either carried out of the country or wasted in ciAil wars; in short, Mexico has been plundered, uot developed. She is just so much poorer to-day by the millions she has yielded to man ; and those millions are proof only of the magnificent endowment Avhich nature bestowed upon the land, not of any extraor dinary wisdom in its administration. At the present time the policy of the Mexican goA^ernment is to tax mining just as much as it will bear. A recent reduction in the exorbitant charges upon the extraction and exportation of bullion was the result merely of the determination of the mining companies to stop work if these tyrannical exactions Avere con tinued; aud I do not yet see the signs of an intelligent and liberal policy towards this industry. The spirit of old Spain, which regarded the treasures of the earth as a prize to be avariciously grasped aud selfishly appropriated, is still dominant in republican Mexico. Au indolent people desires miniug to prosper, not that agriculture, manufactures, and till other forms of industry may also prosper, but that all these industries may be unnecessary. The cure for this eAil is to alienate the mines from the government, make them private property, put them on a level with other property, relieAre them from unjust taxation, and make them a part of a wise general system of internal administration. Whether such a change could be effected as would extend the miner's title along the dip of the A'ein in depth, I do not pretend to decide. In Prussia the inclined location has been abolished; but that country has been so long the scene of mining operations that almost every group of mineral veins has been sufficiently explores! to determine its peculiari ties. Hence, by a proper selection of ground on the surface, a miniug lessee may secure all the advantages of an inclined location. Whatever be the case in Mexico in this respect, it is, I think, quite necessary tit present in our comparatively unexplored mitiingregions to giAre tlie miner what in early days the German law gave him, the right to follow his vein."], [211, "199 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. CHAPTEE XXVI. MODERN GERMAN CODES. The elaborate administration of the mining interest on the part of the state which characterized Germany iu the middle ages is giving way to a more democratic policy. Even' so late as a century ago, the mining code of Frederick the Great made it the duty of the authorities to super intend all mining operations, to inaugurate them in one district, regulate them according to scientific principles in another, or sustain and protect them Avhere they Avere already properly established. This policy is no longer necessary. The spread of knoAvledge and the activity of com merce renders it safe to leave to the miniug communities in the main the management of their oavu affairs. The new Prussian mining law, which took effect October 1, 1806, replacing* the former systems of Prussia, Nassau, HanoATer, Electoral Hesse, Frankfort, and other provinces, pre sents the best example of the modern idea, in Avhich education takes the place of government ; and I shall content myself Avith a brief review of its characteristic features, omitting any detailed description of the present codes of Austria, Saxony, and other German states, as prolonging too tar this already extended historical sketch. 1. According to the general mining laAV of Prussia,* the folloAving minerals are excluded from the proprietary rights of the land-oNvner: Gold, silver, quicksih'er, iron, (with the exception of bog-iron ores,) lead, copper, tin, zinc, cobalt, nickel, arsenic, manganese, antimony, sulphur, ores of alum and Aitriol, pit coal, brown coal, graphite, rock salt and other salts occurring Avith it, and salt springs. These minerals are objects of mining, and the law prescribes the manner in Avhich a title to them can be obtained. The state surrenders entirely its claim to mineral rights, and stands henceforward on the same footing* as priATate citizens, retaining only the rights of police, justice, and finance, which it exercises oaci* e\\*ery other form of property and labor. Special grants, made under the ancient system, are not interfered Avith. To be properly objects of min ing, the minerals enumerated must be (1) in their natural deposits, and (2) in such forms as can be utilized. Alliwial deposits, such as gold or tin placers, are included ; the rare metals, precious stones, amber, petro leum, &c, are either left to the land-owner or made subject to special regulations. Marble and building stone generally are not held as objects of mining. In provinces once Saxon, as in the present kingdom of Saxony, coal belongs to the owner of the surface. 2. Prospecting, (Schiirfen,) Avhether by open cuts, pits, shafts, tunnels, or bore-holes, is allowed to all under the following limitations: It must not be carried on upon any public square, street, or raihvay, nor in grave yards, nor in places AAiiere the authorities forbid it on grounds of public interest, nor, without express consent of the owner, within 200 feet of any building on grounds belonging to the same, nor in gardens or yards. Whoever wishes to prospect on the grounds of another must seek his permission, but every land-owner must give such permission to all appli cants, unless some one of the objections above enumerated can be shown to exist. Probable injury to wells, mineral springs, ponds, or neighbor ing mines is sufficient ground for prevention of prospecting by the min ing authorities. The prospector is bound to pay the land-owner annually * Perhaps the best manuals on this subject are those of Mining Councillor R. Kloster mann, Beilin, and Director A. Huyssen, of Halle, both of which I have freely used, in various portions of this report."], [212, "200 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. in advance for the use of his land, if it be necessarily withdrawn by the prospecting operations from other uses, aud to return it to him at the close of such occupancy, with damages for any depreciation of its value. All disputes arising are settled by the proper court, The prospector must make formal application in every case to the authorities, and receive the necessary license, before commencing to work. The proprietor of mines in operation cannot forbid prospecting in his field for metals to Avhich he has not acquired the right ; but, like the land-owner, he may demand security in advance for possible damages to his own property; and, Avhen the new prospecting Avork actually threateus the safety or the undisturbed operation of the older mines, the authorities may refuse to allow it. But the owner of a mine has the preferred right to apply for permission to Avork for other metals than those already granted to him if the authorities decide that the former had better be mined in common Avith the latter. If the prospector, therefore, discovers them, the previ ous miner in the same field may claim them. 3. The discovery of a vein must be followed by its regular denuncia tion, (Muthung.) This act, like the recording of a claim in American mining districts, giAres the miner at once the right of property iu the mineral. The denunciation, which is also an application for license to mine, is made in writing, and in duplicate. Each copy is endorsed Avith the day and hour of presentation to the authorities, and one is then returned to the applicant. It must contain the name and residence of the applicant, the name of the metal or metals to be mined, a descrip tion of the locality in which the A*ein or deposit has been discovered, and the title by which the mine is to be known. A title already applied to a mine in the same district is not allowable. As I have said, the mere presentation of this document gives the applicant a prima facie OAvnership ; but this right is still conditioned upon the in\\*estigation of the mining authorities, as to the validity of the alleged discoArery. The metal or metals mentioned must be found, by official examination, to exist at the point described, in natural deposit, i. e., not brought there by human agency, and in such quantity as to justify mining. The latter question is a delicate one, and the facts are generally construed with great liberality towards the applicant, who, after all, assumes the great est risk of loss, if the deposit be poor. But certainly the rights of a land-owner are not to be disturbed to favor some crack-brained adAren turer who has found a seam of coal an inch thick, or a lump of galena as large as a walnut. Under this rule the mining authorities of Bonn refused to grant a license on the strength of a few particles of pyrites in the rock. It should be also borne in mind that such a refusal is no real hardship to the prospecter, unless he desires to decei\\*e some one, or the public, as to the Aralue of his claim. He is still free to continue prospect ing as before. Finally, the authorities have to be satisfied that the pro posed concession of a mining field does not conflict with the rights of other parties, whether earlier discoverers or neighboring mine-owners. For this purpose due notice must be given, and a certain time alloAved. MeaiiA\\iiile, the applicant must have the field smweyed by the official surveyor, and file duplicate maps, upon which the discovery-point and boundaries are laid down. This must be done within six weeks after the denunciation, otherwise the latter fails of'Aralidity \u2014 a A*ery important provision, calculated to secure the bona fide prosecution ofa claim by the discoverer. The actual discoverer of a vein has, for one week after his discoAxery, the prior claim, even though another make earlier denuncia tion ; but after the lapse of that period the date of denunciation deter mines priority of right."], [213, "201 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 4. Mining rights are granted, as far as possible, in fields bounded on the surface by straight lines, and in depth by vertical planes. The ancient custom of granting \"inclined locations\" on the dip ofthe vein is thus entirely abolished, and modern authorities in Europe do not hesi- tate to condemn it as productive of great uncertainty and litigation.* The size of the field on the surface may be a little over five acres in most parts of Prussia, but is restricted to quarter of an acre in a few districts, for special reasons. These areas give only the maximum; of course smaller fields may be granted. The shape ofthe field may vary, straight lines being the boundaries, and the greatest length not exceeding for a five-acre field about 13,000 feet (2,000 Prussiau Lachter or fathoms,) and for a quarter-acre field one-fourth that distance. The discovery-point must lie within the field, though not necessarily in the centre. 5. All preliminaries being complete, the deed (Verleihungsurkunde) is made out in the name of the king, and published iu the official news- paper of the district. It contains the name, business, and residence of the grantee, the name of the mine, the area and boundaries of the field, Avith a description of its location as to parish, county, civil aud mining districts, the names ofthe metals to be mined, the date, and the seal and signature of the authorities. Three months tire allowed for the assertion of conflicting claims, after which the rights of such claimants, in ordinary cases, expire. Under certain conditions, which I will not pause to enumerate, the consolidation of adjacent mines is permitted. The division of one field into several, or the exchange between neighboring mines of portions of their respective fields, is generally permitted by the authorities; but such divisions or exchanges are not permitted as would leave segregated mining fields too small to be worked independently. 6. The nature of the property thus conveyed to the grantee is defined as \"the right to obtain and utilize the minerals excluded for reasons of political economy from the title of the land-owner, and to construct, above aud under ground, all necessary buildings and apparatus for this purpose,\" This right may be sold, mortgaged, and leA'ied upon, like real estate. It must be exercised, however, under certain regulations, justi- fied by the general good, and fixed by the state, and, when these condi- tions are not complied with, the right itself may be impaired or forfeited. A few of the more important conditions will be enumerated. The mine- owner is bound to keep the mine in operation, if so required by the authorities. It is no longer, as formerly, forbidden to let a mine lie idle for more than a certain period. On the contrary, work may be sus- pended at any time, without the formal permission of the authorities ; and they can only demand its resumption when clearly required by pub- lic interests. A great lack of the metals produced, and an impossibility of obtaining a supply from other quarters, would be a satisfactory rea- son for such a demand. The owner has six months' time in which to comply Avith this demand, and, eA*en before it is issued, is entitled to a hearing of his protest. He may also appeal to the minister of commerce. If he intends to resume work, he gives the authorities four weeks' notice of the fact. But if he fails to comply Avith their demand, they may proceed to deprive him of his grant, unless the circumstances which made the demand proper have in the mean time changed. Every mine must be worked according to a plan, Avhich must previously be submit ted to the government officials, and approA*ed by them, if no objection is made, the mine-OAmer may proceed with his plan. If the plan is * This question will be found elsewhere discussed, with reference to the particular condi tion of this country."], [214, "202 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. objected to, which can only be on grounds of safety to the mine, the miners, and the public, the miue-OAvner must either convince the author ities that their objections are unfounded, or change bis plan to obviate them. Violation' of this rule is punished with fine, and if necessary the authorities may suspend operations at the mine, Every mine must have an exact map of the underground workings, and this must be periodically perfected as the work advances. The responsible managers and superintendents of mines must be reported to the authorities, and if necessary examined as to their capacity for their several positions. If a person not recognized as competent by tbe mining authorities is put in charge of a mine, they may demand his removal, or suspend the operations of the mine until a competent person is appointed. Super intendents are responsible for the proper working of the mines accord ing to the plans agreed upon, and bound to afford the proper officials free opportunity for inspecting the works, and all desired information. The mine-owner is bouud to furnish, at stated periods, the statistical informa tion called for by the minister of commerce. He must also permit per sons bearing the permission of the authorities to enter his works. (This provision is most beneficial to students at a German school of mines, since they enjoy by virtue of it an opportunity of studying practical operations, such as they could not other Avise obtain.) 7. The mining authorities are: 1. The district officials (Revierbeamten, ;) 2. The supreme mining bureaux ( Oberbcrgamter ; ) and 3. The minister of commerce, The district officials are inspecting and reporting officers or surveyors. The names given in a previous chapter, on the codes of the middle ages, are mostly retained, but the superintendents and mining captains are no longer government officials. The mining bureaux are presided over by the directors, as formerly. They issue licenses and grants, and have the general administration of the law in their hands. The minister is appealed to in the last instance. 8. In addition to these authorities there are the courts, the jurisdiction of which is determined by statutes, and is not at present important for us to consider. It is, hoAvever, a fact not Avithout signifies uce that all the German states have Ararious courts, in Avhich cases arising in mining operations maybe adjudicated, often Avithout the tedious forms attendant upon ordinary suits. The English court of the stannaries is an institu tion of this kind, and the English \"cost-book\" system of stock companies is also the counterpart of the immemorial Gcwerkschaftcn of Germany. Our American mining districts contain many examples of mining part nerships or associations of a similar character ; and no doubt it will be found advisable in the course of time to establish courts and rides of procedure adapted especially to this state of things, as has been donein all older states. Further remarks on this subject will be found in the chapter on English mining law. 9. The Prussian laAv in respect to the taxation of mines has been greatly simplified, but there still remain many complicated provisions which must be regarded as legacies of the past. In Aiew of the history of that kingdom under the most remarkable dynasty of modern times, its gradual increase from the original limits of the little duchy of Brandenburg, by constant territorial acquisitions, to its present imperial proportions, and the respect which it has always shown towards existing laws and privi leges, aud towards its own past contracts and grants, it is not wonderful that those differences in legislation which I have mentioned in a preAious chapter as growing up in the petty states of Germany should still be to some extent perpetuated in the provinces of Prussia, The present Prussian mining law is based upon nearly a score of ancient codes, and"], [215, "203 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. recognizes many local exceptions to its general provisions. There has been, however, a steady progress towards unity and simplicity, and the general outline of this progress is instructive. According to former laAvs all mines were bound to pay the sover eign a royalty of one-tenth of their gross product free of mining cost to him. This was reduced by the law of 1851 to one-twentieth ; by the law of 1861 a gradual decrease was established amounting to one-fifth of the royalty per annum, until the royalty should be reduced to two percent.; by the law of 1802 iron mines were declared entirely free of royalty, and a new decree established Avith regard to all mines,' by virtue of which, after January 1, 1805, the royalty was to be but one per cent.; and this is the present amount paid to the state under that head. The state pays its share of the expenses of reducing ores, but receives its percentage of gross product free of mining cost. But in addition to the royalty there were formerly innumerable taxes and commissions paid by the mines to cover the expenses of the scientific and financial administration carried on by the state. In some provinces (as I haA*e said in a preAious chapter) the sovereign had a certain share of the stock of eATery company as a complimentary gift; and on this he could draw his diAidends like any other stockholder, being bound at the same time to pay assessments or forfeit his interest. There were quar terly dues, additional quarterly dues, dues for measurements, for speci mens, for inspections, for auditing accounts, for supeiwision and direction, for affidavits, for Aveighing, for assaying, for surATeying, in short for eA*ery act which the goArernment officials performed ; and these were not fees but fixed sums assessed upon the mines, as a hotel-keeper on the Rhine charges for candles, attendance, etc., the same amount in eArery guest's account. All these petty payments are now abolished, and in place of them a regular \" tax of supervision,\" amounting* to one per cent, of the value of the product, is levied on mines in actual operation. When surveys or other special services are performed for any mine, the official is merely paid a proper fee for his labor. Many of the services formerly performed by the officials may now be done by others, the authorities reserving only the right to insist upon the employment of competent persons. The tax of supervision of one per cent, is therefore nothing more than a contribution from the mines to secure thorough scientific inspection aud direction of their works at a far cheaper rate than would be possible under any other arrangement. What American mining compauy, even among the wealthiest, could obtain the service of a whole board of able engineers and metallurgists, such as the directors and inspectors of every German mining* district, by the payment of one per cent, of its product? Certaiuly in that vast number of our mines whicii are just beginning to produce, and need more than any others wise counsel and direction, much time, labor, aud money are wasted, because com petent direction is too expensive. I think it possible to deAise a plan, not inconsistent Avith American ideas of indiAidual liberty, by Avhichthe opportunity to acquire such assistance may be afforded to our mining districts. 'But a national school must first give us the material in the shape of thoroughly trained engineers, before Ave can expect either legis lation or association to secure so great a reform. To recapitulate : the Prussian laAv, apart from local exceptions, imposes a royalty of one per cent., which is net revenue to the state, and a tax of one per cent,, Avhich the state expend^ for the good ofthe mines themseh*es. I shall urge, in the sequel, that tlie United States ought to repudiate the whole doctrine ofa royalty, as such, and leave the mines free from taxation under that bead. The late bullion tax was something of that nature, and"], [216, "204 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. has properly been abolished. But that the mines, thus relieved of all bur dens, may rightfully be required to contribute something toward the expense of such necessary provisions for their oavu benefit as they cannot make, in their isolated condition, for themselves, is a far more reasonable proposition, and one whicii deserves serious consideration. A tax far lighter than the late bullion tax might be so expended as to save to the mines themselves millions of dollars eA'ery year. Prussia received from her mines, in 1865, a little over $9,000,000 gold (American.) This was partly the product of mines actually worked by the state, and partly the royalty from others. The expense incurred by Prussia on account of the mines in the same year was more than $7,000,000, leaAing a net profit of only $2,000,000. The steady reduction of taxes under such circumstances shows that the goArernment has adopted the wise and liberal policy of administering the mining law so as to secure, not an immediate revenue to itself, but an energetic and skilful development of the resources of the country, rightly deeming the increased production and use ofthe metals to be worth more to the nation than a feAv thousands of dollars, obtained by stifling this most beneficent industry. CHAPTEE XXVII. THE CODE OF FRANCE. It was the law of April 21, 1810, in the formation of whicii the Emperor Napoleon I took so large a part, which gave its present constitution to the mining industry of France. Under the ancient monarchy the mines were regarded as a dependency of the royal domain, and only the sover eign could grant permission for their exploitation. Such grants had only a temporary character, and were most frequently encumbered with oner ous conditions of payments into the royal treasury, besides those which in the majority of cases must be made to the oAvner of the soil. After the abolition of feudal rights, the mines and mineral deposits of France Avere placed, by the law of July 28, 1791, at the disposal of the nation, and the government Avas authorized to make \" concession \" of them ; but this concession was at the same time forbidden to be other- Avise than temporary; and, moreover, all that part of every mineral deposit lying Avithin a hundred feet of the surface was expressly reserved to the lauded proprietor, who also had a right of preference in obtaining the concession. These provisions nearly amounted to a prohibition of general mining. It was made easy to mine in the case of those persons only who, being farmers, would probably not care, or know how to mine ; and it is no wonder that, under these restrictions, little progress was made in the exploitation of mineral deposits. The law of 1810 declared, in accordance with the Code Xapoleon, that the property in minerals goes with the property in land ; but stipulated that the government might separate the two, granting the mineral right, even in perpetuity, to another than the land-owner, on the single condi tion of a tribute paid to the latter. It made this property in minerals negotiable and taxable like any other, putting it on a basis as secure as that of real estate. In this Avay protection Avas given to capitalists desiring to engage in mining, and an era of prosperity, previously im- * This summary of the subject will be found, subtantially, in the splendid official publica tion, Resumi des Travaux des Statistique de I' Adv.inistration des Mines, 1853-9, pao-e 6."], [217, "205 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. possible, was inaugurated for the mines of France. The law, in making this distinction between surface and subterranean proprietorship, has included in the class of mines only those substances which by reason of their nature or the manner of their occurrence must be exploited in a certain way, according to special rules. All other minerals are left to the proprietor of the soil, and may be worked under a simple permission, or without such permission, subject to the police regulations established by go vernient. Minieres, or surface works, such as beds of iron-ore, workable by open excavation, pyritous earths, suitable for the manufac ture of copperas, or deposits of peat, require the permission referred to ; quarries (carrieres) of building-stone, marble, granite, sandstone, &c, require only observance of the police regulations. Mines, in the sense of the law, capable of becoming the objects of a concession, include therefore mineral fuels, bitumens, sulphur, alum, and metalliferous depo sits of every kind except the beds of iron specially classed as minieres. Among the substances thus legally subject to segregation from the sur face proprietorship, only two, mineral fuel and iron, are worked to any large extent in France. Aside from these, there were in that country in 1860, oidy 247 mines of all kinds, classified as follows: Graphite and bitumen 50 Pyritic and aluminiferous ores 15 Bock salt and salt springs 29 Antimony 24 Manganese 20 Lead and galena 18 Lead and sdver 27 Copper 9 Copper, lead aud silver 17 Lead, silver, zinc, copper, and other metals 30 Gold and silver, separate or together 3 Arsenic, separate or with gold and siver 2 Tin 2 Sulphur 1 Total 247 At the time when the law of 1810 was passed, however, the mines of France were not so limited in number. The productive provinces west of the Ehine, which now belong to Prussia, were then included in the empire of Napoleon; and the principles of mining law, as well as the rates of taxation established by the French law of 1810 and the impe rial decree of 1811, remained in force under the Prussian supremacy until the end of 1864. The only change made by the Prussian law in regard to royalty is the subjection of salt mines and springs in those provinces to the state. This was necessary on account of the monopoly of salt maintained by the Prussian government. In all other respects the law of Napoleon virtually continued in west Prussia. The provisions with regard to taxes were these: Each mine paid a certain fixed sum per annum, according to the size of its field, and also a tax of 5 per cent, on its net profits. To this amount one-tenth was added to cover incidentals. The net profit was ascertained by subtract ing the current expenses only, not the cost of permanent improvements, from the total production. These taxes amounted in the aggregate to about 2 per cent, of the gross product; and since the 1st of January, 1865 they have been replaced by a single tax of that amount. It is, of"], [218, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 206 course, much easier to collect a tax on gross receipts than on net profits, and the result is the same to the mines. Prussia has also declared the iron mines free of tax. Thanks to the law of Napoleon, which swept away with vigorous hand the accumulated privileges and forms ot the past, or, perhaps, we might rather say, thauks to the revolution which burned off the forest-growths of centuries and left him an open field, and finally, thanks to the judicious legislation of Prussia, less hampered here than in her eastern provinces, the districts west of the Rhine enjoy one of the simplest and most efficient mining codes in the world. CHAPTER XXVIII. MINING LAWS OF SAVITZERLAND. On this subject Hon. John Hitz, consid general of Switzerland, writes as follows : I can only state that, after a careful perusal of the federal laws of Switzerland, I find nothing having reference to mining privileges. As you are aware, the federal government of Switzerland owns no territory in the cantons, and therefore exercises no authority what ever over the mineral or other deposits contained in such cantons. If any laws exist rela tive to miniug, they must be cantonal regulations; and among these which now lie before me I find no other mention than in the laws of Glarus, whicii provide (Art. 42) that \"within the jurisdiction of the Landesgemcinde (cantonal government) fall * the regulation of salines and \"forests, water rights, game, and fisheries, wine tax, market, and mines, as well as the purchase aud sale of real estate;\" and in the laws of Valais a passage which declares, (Art. 29,) \"The following are the powers of the Grand Council: * * * 9. It shall issue concessions of mines, and may authorize their transfer to third parties.\" As you are aware, even cantonal authorities do not own territory as public domain. Every inch oi' ground belongs either to private individuals, corporations, or communes ; and the two cantons above named are the only ones known to me who claim to be the dis pensers of mining privileges, unless the extraction of salt is considered such a privilege, in which case Ihe canton of Aargau owns, and either operates itself or leases, certain salt wells on its territory along- the Rhine, near Rheinfelden. It is evident from the foregoing statement of the consul general that the mining industry of Switzerland is not sufficiently important to call for general federal legislation, while the democratic policy of the Swiss has entirely destroyed the doctrine of any inherent right of royalty to minerals residing in the government. CHAPTER XXIX. MINING LAW OF ENGLAND. The English law of mines is, Uke all English laAV, the growth of cen turies, and complicated with many local regulations and \" immemorial customs.\" The oft-quoted \" case of mines,\" in the reign of Elizabeth, referred the crown right to the common laAV, aud the decision of the judges Avas that all gold or silver ores belonged to the crown, Avhether in private or public lands; that any ores containing neither gold nor silver belonged to the proprietor of the sod ; that the king* could grant * Plowden, 31, 310, quoted in Hon. J. Ross Browne's first report, p. 217. The quaint reason given by Ouslow in this case was that, \" because gold and silver are the most excel lent things which the soil contains, the law has appointed them, as in reason it ought, to the person most excellent, aud that is the king.\" (See Pettus, Fodinae Regales.)"], [219, "207 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. away mines of gold or silver, but not without express words in his patent, demonstrating his intention to sever the mines from his royal patrimony. It is indeed not improbable that the crown once laid claim to all mines, and it is well known that at a comparatively recent period it Avas attempted to comprise Avithin the royal prerogative all those of copper and tin, on the grouud that these ores necessarily contain some portion of gold or silver. In the reign of William and Mary, however, two enactments* secured to the subject the enjoyment of all mines in Avhich tin, copper, iron, or lead are found, notwithstanding any quantity of the precious metals mixed. The property in minerals uusevered from the laud, whether held together Avith the property in the laud or sepa rate from it, is what the law terms a corporeal hereditament, as dis tinguished from the mere right to work for them, which is an incorpo real hereditament. Apart from the claims of the crown, the property in minerals is prima facie in the owner of the fee of the laud, whether in possession, remainder, or reversion, or subject to the tenancy ot other persons. But the property in minerals is not necessarily accompanied by the light to Avork for them.f Indeed, when the OAvner of the fee is not in possession, nobody can work for the minerals ; not the tenant, lest he commit Avaste ;\u00a3 not the lord of the manor, because he has not possession ofthe surface, nor eAren of the subsoil. The minerals are part ofthe demesnes ofthe manor, and naturally follow the fee in every case'. Thus, for instance, minerals found on the sea-shore beloAv ordinary high water mark belong prima facie to the crown; betAveen the ordinary and extreme high water mark, to the OAvner of the adjoining freehold; in land suddenly left by the retirement of the sea, to the croAvn ; in land formed by the casting up of alluvial matter, to the lord of the manor. The property in minerals, and the right to search for them, may be vested iu other persons than the owner of the fee, by alienation, pre scription, or custom. In the case of alienation there is an important distinction between such a conveyance as confers an estate and such as merely confers a right to dig, Avithout property in the minerals until severed from the soil. A conveyance of the former class is binding forever, Avhether the owner of the minerals continues to Avork for them or not. This dis tinction of laAV between an estate in minerals and the right to mine is tin important one; it describes exactly the step Avhich the United States government takes, in the mining law of 1866, by which a perpetual estate is granted to those Avho had up to that time only been able to enjoy a possessory title, conferring the right to mine. According to the English statute of frauds no legal interest in minerals beyond that of a ten ancy at -will can be created or transferred otherwise than by writing. The effect of this and other statutes is to make an instrument under seal necessarv for the conveyance of any interest beyond that of a ten ant at will, or for less than three years, as also for the conveyance of a right to dig for minerals. The most general forms of conveyance for particular interests are either leases of the minerals or licenses to dig them for a term of vears. A license is not exclusive in its nature unless expressly so drawn- the grantor may Avork himself for the minerals, or he may license other persons to do so. Conflicting claims, arising out of different licenses, would probably be decided in equity in favor of the party in possession and actually working. * 1 AArm. and M., c. 30 ; 5 Wai. and M., c. 6. t For these and other points, see authorities quoted in Collier's Law of Mines, p. 14, ct. seq., from which much of this sk.ch of the English law is taken. t Tenants may dig open mines to get for their own use gravel, clay, marl, or manure, and, it has been held, coal and iron also."], [220, "208 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. A lease is necessarily exclusive of the rights of all other persons, vesting in the grantee the absolute possession of the whole of the sub ject-matter demised.* The legal estate in mines can only be alienated in the modes thus noticed; but an equitable interest, Avith a title to a share of produce, may be acquired by agreement, either Avritten or spoken, express or implied, attended with equitable rights against coad venturers, and with legal liabilities to the public. A mining com pany, for instance, can only acquire title to mines by deed (., e., by an instrument under seal) or by prescription or custom, of whicii I shall speak presently; but each stockholder may acquire effective title to his share of profits by virtue of a mere certificate, or, rather, by a mere agreement, of AA'hich the certificate is the comrenient expression or result. This kind of title in mines is subject to the statutes affecting partnerships, joint-stock companies, and cost-book mines, t Prescription aud custom, as has already beeu said, may also vest in other persons than the owner of the fee the property in minerals, or the right to search for them. According to Coke, t prescription is a personal * The granting clauses in the form of a lease of metals, with license to dig, use of water, &c, are as follows : \" In consideration of ; * he, the said A B, hath given, granted, and demised, and by these presents doth give, grant, and demise unto the said C D, his executors, adminis- trators, aud assigns, all copper, and all other ores, metals, or minerals (except coals) to be found iu, under, and throughout the lands and premises comprised within the limits herein- after described, * * together with full and free liberty, license, and authority to dig, mine, work, and search for the same, and to raise aud bring to grass all such copper and other metals and minerals, * * to carry away and convert the same to his and their own use aud uses, and at his and their wills and pleasure to pass and repass, carry and recarry, and to drive, dig, work, and make any new or other adit or adits, shaft or shafts, pits, drifts, leats, and watercourses in, over, upon, and through any part of the said prem- ises, and to use those already made and driven, and to erect thereon any shed or sheds, \u25a0rill or mills, engine or engines, or other buildings as he * * * shall from time to time think necessary and convenient for the more effectually working the premises aforesaid, and for working, washing, dressing, cleaning, manufacturing, bringing about, and making mer- chantable such copper and other ores, metals, aud minerals, * * * to have and to hold, use, exercise, and enjoy all and singular the several powers, liberties, and authorities hereby granted and intended so to be, (excepting and reserving and subject as aforesaid,) * * * from the day ofthe date of these presents for and during the term and time of years now next ensuing, and fully to be complete and ended.\" * * * * Tbe grant is qualified by various agreements between the parties The use of water may be granted for the purpose of mining, subject to the rights and privileges of others already acquired, and to such other reservations as the circumstances require. The time, manner, aud amount of payment of rent or royalty is specified, {tribute is not strictly rent, ' and the lessee is bound to keep proper accounts, accessible to the landlord, to work the mine with all reasonable expedition \"regularly and effectually, and iu every respect according to the most approved modern practice of good miners,\" &c, &c, with greater or less fulness of detail, according to the whim of the parties. My experience in this country rather favors the drawing of a mining lease in general terms, leaving it for the courts to decide, in case of disagreement, what is fair dealing on either part. Detailed specifications in the lease do not obviate, but complicate, litigation. t The cost-book system in use in Cornwall and Devonshire differs from ordinary partner ships on the one hand, and joint-stock companies on the other. The principal distinction from ordinary trading partner hips appears to be the absence of the delectus persona, and consequently a limited liability ; while the organization differs from that of a stock-com pany in the fact that its powers are not delegated to an aristocracy of directors, but directly exercised by the whole body cf shareholders The following is the form of transfer of share in a cost-book miae : \"I, , do hereby, for valuable consideration, sell, assign, and transfer unto parts or shares of and in a certain mine or adventure, called situate in the parish of , county of , together with the like share or proportion of and in all engines, tools, tackle, materials, ores, halvaus, moneys, and all other appurte nances thereto belonging, together with all dividends and profits in respect of the said part or share, and all interest, privileges, and advantages to be derived therefrom. As witness, &c. \" I do hereby accept the said shares, subject to the same terms and conditions, rules and regulations, as the said held the same.\" tl Inst., 113."], [221, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 209 usage, as that such an one and his ancestors or those whose estate he hath, have used, time out of mind, to have such an advantage or privi- lege. Prescription can be claimed only by the owner for the time being of the freehold ; an incorporeal hereditament only can be subject ol ir, and it must be of origin beyond the time of legal memory; in other words, the right to work for minerals, but not the legal estate iu them, may be subject of prescription. ) Custom is defined to be a usage of the inhabitants of a certain dis- trict, and requires three things for its validity : It must have its origin beyond legal memory, (\"from time Avhereof' the memory of man run- neth not to the contrary ;\") it must have been uninterrupted; and it must be reasonable. The laAV is very careful to guard against the abuse of this right. In fact, the whole institution of \" immemorial custom\" is based only upon the principle that it is better to allow certain deviations from the rules of abstract justice laid down for general practice, than to commit the greater injustice of invading the established usages of soci- ety, and disappointing the Avell-gTounded confidence of honest citizens therein. The notion that a custom may be arbitrarily created or modi- fied at any given time, \"by popular sovereignty,\" so as to affect the vested rights of property, is foreign to English .and to every other law worthy of the name. It really overthroAvs the Avhole foundation on which this humane maxim has been built. A good illustration of an immemorial custom, affecting the right to mining property, is the \" tin bounding\" which formerly preA*ailed iu Cornwall and DeA-onshire, and is still A*alid, though comparatively dis- used in those districts. A charter granted in the third year of King- John to the tinners of Corinvall and DeA*on speaks of it as already ancient.* In the recent case of Rogers ps.Brentou, 10 Q.B., 26, the custom was stated and confirmed by* the jury as follows : \" That any person may enter on the waste land of another in Cornwall, and mark out by four corner boundaries a certain area ; a Avritten description of the land so marked with metes and bounds, and the name of the person for Avhose use the proceeding is taken, is recorded in an immemorial local court, called the stannary court, and proclaimed at three successive courts held at stated intervals ; if no objection is succesfully made by any other person the court awards a writ to the bailiff of the court to dcliA*cr pos- session of the said 'bounds or tin-Avork' to the bounder, aa*1io thereupon has the exclusive right to search for, dig, and take to his oavh use all tin and tin ore within the described limits, paying to the land-owner a certain customary proportion of the ore raised under the name of toll- tin. The right descends to executors, and maybe presen*ed for an indefi- nite time, either by actually working and paying toll, or by annually renewing the four boundary marks on a certain day.\" Similar customs exist in Derbyshire, in the forest of Dean, and in various parts of Europe. In the case above alluded to, Rogers, thc plaintiff, claimed his exclusive rights as a bounder, though he had neglected the mine for many years, pleading that the bounds had been regularly rencAved. The defendant Avas agent of a company which had begun to work the mine aud refused to recognize the alleged rights of the plaintiff. .Much evidence was given concerning the nature and prevalence of the custom. Tho witnesses agreed that the bounds could be preserved by mere annual renewal with out working, and some of them doubted whether eA'en tho ceremony of * Quod possiut (stammatores nostri) omni tempore libere et quiete absque alicujus homi nis vexatione fodere stammum, et turbns ad strimmum fundendum * * * sicut soli bunt ct consuevcrunt. et emere buscam \u00bb * * et divertere aquas ad operationem eorum ill stammariis sicut dc antiques' consuctudinc consueveruut. H. Ex. Doc. 51 14"], [222, "210 RELATIONS OF GOA'ERNMENTS TO MINING. renewal was n\u00abcessary, except as eA*klence of the right. They also dif fered as to the consequence of neglecting to renew on the exact day. None could assign any limit to the surface of land that might be included within the four corners, but it Avas said to be generally very small. One of the most experienced witnesses remembered a pair of tin-bounds \" a quarter of a mile each way,\" but this Avas the largest he knew of. Only one instance was recollected by any Avitness of bounds recently pro claimed; all the wastes of tin-mining districts were supposed to be already under ancient bounds. The jury found, as to the question of fact, a ver dict for the plaintiff, on the ground that working was not essential to the custom. The court, hoAveA-er, decided that the custom as found to exist by the jury was unreasonable in as far as it conferred a right to bounds on a person not actually working. The opinion pronounced on this occasion by Lord Denman is a most thorough and elaborate explana tion of the principles underlying the case, and deserves to be studied by American legislators. I quote a few passages:* Upon the ownership of the land, giving a prima facie title to minerals, the custom of bounding has been engrafted. \u00bb * * In substance it is this: the mine is parcel of the soil ; the ownership is in the owner of the soil, but it is a parcel which, to discover and bring to the surface, may ordinarily require capital, skill, enterprise, aud combination; which, while in the bowels of the earth, is wholly useless to the owner as well as to the public ; and the bringing of which into the market is eminently for the benefit of the public. It therefore, the owner of the soil cannot, or will not, do this for himself, he shall not be allowed to lock it up from the public ; and, therefore, in such case (unless, by enclosure, he may seem to have 'evoted the land to other important purposes inconsistent with minino operations, such as agriculture or building) any tinner, i. e., any man employing himself in tm mining, may secure to himself the right to dig the mines under the lauds, rendering a certain portion of the produce to the owner of the soil. It is right to observe, in passing, how every step, even in this strong invasion of the rights of ownership, still is made with reference to them. In the first place, the land to be bounded must be wastrel ; if it be several and enclosed, it must have been anciently bounded while wastrel, and so, in the language of the country, assured for wastrel ; the liability must have first attached on it, therefore, before enclosure aud devotion to other useful purposes. Then attet the tinner or bounder has commenced by cutting the turves, and so making out the limits within which he will work, proceedings are to be taken in the stannary courts, of which the owner has notice, and sufficient time is allowed before the bounder's title becomes complete, dur ing which the owner may still intervene and preserve his lights eutirc, so as he will exercise them for the benefit of the public. If he abstain from any interference it may well be considered that he has consented to the bounder's proceedings: aud the customary render of the portion called toll-tint may be a very sufficient consideration to him for what he gives up of his origina exclusive rights. * * * This then brings us to the point which was more especially contested on the argument/whether this customary right can exist without cou tiuuing bona side to search for tiu, and to work the land for mining purposes with the enclosed limits ; whether it is sufficient to renew the bounds annually by a new cutting of the turves as at the commencement. Assuming for the present the validity of the custom, if the bona fide working within the bounds be made a part of it, and assuming that it is a custom which is to be tried by the tests} established by the common law for ascertaining whether a custom be good or not, it appears to us that without this qualification it cannot be sustained. Cus toms, especially where they derogate from the geueral rights of property, must be construed strictly ; and above all things, they must be reasonable. Bounding is a direct interference with the common law rights of property; it takes from the owner of the land, who is unable 01 unwilling at a particular moment to dig for tin under his waste land, the right to do so Umaybe forever, and vests it in a stranger, making only the customary render in return-' * The opinion may be found in 10 Q. h., 26, and the passages here quoted, with others, in Colliers JLaw ot Mines, p. 33 et seq. t \"The custom in Devonshire, as declared in the convocation rolls of the stannary parlia ments tor that county differs from that in Cornwall, principally in being a freehold interest descending to the heir, aud being unaccompanied by the obligation to pay any toll or com pensation to the land-owner. The Cornish custom having been mainly supported on the ground of its being accompanied by this obligation, there seems little reason to doubt that the cusom in Devonshire, it found by a jury to exist in fact, would be deemed void in law \"- Colliers Law oj Mines, American edition paae 41 1 According to Cudden vs. Estwick G Mod!, 124, and other cases, the conditions are, that the party bound should have a benefit, the party claiming be at some charge, and that i should have a reasonable commencement. 5"], [223, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 211 it empowers the stranger not only to extract the mineral from beneath the surface, but to enter on the surface, and cumber it with machiuery, buildings, and refuse stuff which the operations below occasion,* and all this without the least regard to the convenience or inter ests of the owner. The only things which make this reasonable are the render of the toll-tin to the owner, aud the benefit to the public secured thereby in the extraction of the mineral from the bowels of the earth. Both these are not only lost, but the latter, it may be, posi tively prevented, if the bounder may decline to work and yet retain the right to exclude the owner. Instead of iusuring that the minerals should be brought to the surface, the custom so construed may be made the means of keeping them locked up within it, and at the same time preventing any improvement in the surface. Many bounds may become the property of the same owners, who may think their interests best served by limiting the supply and diminishing competition, while the owner will decline to spend his capital in building or agricultural improvements, because at any moment the bounder may renew his operations, aud entirely aud without compensation defeat the purposes of his expenditure. If it be said that the public good is best served by that regulated supply which best serves the private interests of the bounder, that wherever it is for the interest of tlie public that the mine should be worked, the interest of the bounder will be to meet the demand by an adequate supply, aud that when the mine is not worked, it is only because it is for the interest equally of both that it should not be; without admitting or denying the truth of these assertions, one answer is that, where such a state of things has existed so long and so decidedly as to amount to reasonable proof that the original purpose with which the bounds were enclosed has been abandoned, it is unreasonable to maintain tbe bounds themselves. It may have been that the owner did not enclose the land or work for the mineral himself, only on account of a temporary inability, or the temporary existence of the same causes which the bounder now alleges as the ground for bis ceasing to work. Why then is he to lose his earlier and better right forever, and under the same circumstances the bounder to preserve his? Another answer is drawn from regarding the original purpose of the custom, which was not founded on tbe doctrine of demand and supply, but on the expediency sim ply of bringing the mineral to the surface for the use of men. In view of these and other considerations, the court held that the pro vision in question was A*oid, because unreasonable; and there aie good grounds for supposing that the unqualified right claimed was also histori cally to be refuted, as but an abuse of the original limits of the custom. t I haA*e quoted this exposition of the laAV at some length, because the principles laid doAvn are universally applicable and just. They apply with equal force to the case of mines in public lands ; and the frequency with which they are violated by the Avhimsical \" regulations\" of mining districts in the United States is an eAil which requires immediate atten tion, now that those regulations haA*e been formally recognized as ATalid to some extent in law, and as furnishing a proper basis for the acquisition of the estate iu minerals from the general government. I shall discuss this subject more fully in the sequel. I do not find any traces in the law of England of a recognition of the right to follow mineral deposits in depth outside of the boundaries marked upon the surface. Statutes regulating the manner of working mines, the employment of children, &c, have from time to time been made by Parliament. So, for instance, a bill passed February 14, 1860, provides for the regulation and inspection of mines, and prescribes general rules as to safety-lamps, ven tilation, guide-rods, &c.f The laAVS and equities relating to mining in England are administered generally by the courts of chancery and common law. There is, hoAvever, *A .cording to the legal maxim, \" Cuicunquc aii quid conceditur, conceditur etiam id sine quo res ipsa non esse potuit.\" The right to obtain minerals comprises the right to do all that is necessary thereto. tThe ancient charters were granted to tinners \" operantes in stannariis,\" and \"dum operantur.\" In Carew's Survey of Cormcall, sol. 136, ed. 1769, it is said, \"These bouudsbe is bound to renew onceeverie yeere, as also ip most places to bestow sometime in working the myne, otherwise he loseth his privilege.\" Collier, quoting from Smirke, gives these and other instances. t Levi's Annals of British Legislation, ix. 1861."], [224, "212 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. a court of very ancient origin,* called the stannaries court (formerly several courts, called stannary courts, held before the stewards of the four stannaries) and now presided over by the vice-warden of the stan naries. This court has both common law and equitable jurisdiction, con current with that of the superior courts aud the county court, and affords an easy and expeditious method of settling such disputes as arise out of mining transactions. The proceedings in equity concern chiefly the mines operated on the cost-book system, and contrast favorably with the prolonged, complicated, and expensive operations of the courts of chan cery. The late Prince Albert was lord-warden of the stannaries. CHAPTER XXX. MINING REGULATIONS IN AUSTRALIA.! Gold was discovered in Australia in 1851, by Hargraves, a miner from California. A considerable immigration of miners ensued, and laws were enacted in 1852 and 1853 by the legislative council of New South Wales, \"for regulating the management of the gold fields, raising a revenue therefrom, and for the preservation of order thereon.\" The first of these laws authorized the governor general to grant to British subjects only leases and licenses for mining purposes, for terms not exceeding 20 years, and by the eighth section, aliens were to pay twice the license-fees and royalties payable by British subjects. The ordinary license-fee to mine and dig for gold in any waste lands of the Crown was 30 shillings per mouth. For a grant of permission to work a quartz vein, the fee was \u00a325; and for each renewal, tbe same sum was paid. The act of 1853 reuiOA*ed the distinction between British citizens and aliens, admitting the latter to \" the like privileges of Avorking the gold mines and gold fields of the colony, and of employing themselves thereon, as now are or hereafter may be enjoyed by British subjects. The fees are reduced to 10 shillings for a license to dig or mine for gold upon Crown lands, and one-half of that rate for license to mine upon private lands, already leased from the Crown for pastoral purposes. CHAPTER XXXI. MINING LAWS OF CANADA. The different proAinces of the Dominion havTe, I believe, different local codes. The most instructive for my purpose are those of Nova Scotia and Ontario. The letter of Hon. P. S. Hamilton, commissioner of mines at Halifax, published iu the last report of Mr. J. W. Taylor, United States eoniinissioner, on the resources of States and Territories east of the Rocky mountains, contains an outline of the law of NoAra Scotia, from Avhich the folloAving paragraphs are taken :\u00a3 \"Confirmed rather than created by charters, 3 John and 33 Edw. 1, often subsequently recognized and defined, and finally established in its present form during the reign of William, IV. tThis account' is taken substantially from Mr. Gregory Yale's Book on Mining Claims aDd Water Eights, San Francisco, 1307. X A still jnore full and complete account of the law of Nova Scotia maybe found in the Guide to Nova Scotia,, by Alexander Heatherington, editor of the Halifax Mining Gazette."], [225, "213 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. Whoever may be the owner of the land, gold mines in Nova Scotia belong in the first instance to the CroAvn. At leastthis is practically the case as yet, There are portions of land in the province which have been granted without reserving to the CroAvn any minerals, but upon such unlimited grants no gold has yet been discovered. As a rule, out of all laud granted in Nova Scotia there are reserved to the croAvn all mines and deposits of gold, silver, lead, tin, iron, copper, and coal. All other mineral substances are conveyed with the soil. The regulations improvised by the governor and council on the first discovery of gold in Nova Scotia, as also the first \" gold field act\" passed by the provincial legislature, were framed, as might naturally enough be supposed, with but a very imperfect knowledge of what was requisite to a gold-mining community anywhere, still more of all that was peculiar in the Nova Scotian gold fields, and would most conduce to their deA^elopment. Con sequently they Avere hampered with many provisions which experience soon proved to be useless, but which bore heavily and vexationsly upon those who engaged in mining enterprises. There is little room to doubt that the check thus given to such enterprises at their Areryr conception is, in its results, felt to some extent even yet. The law now in force, which Avith its subsequent amendments was framed by the writer of this paper, (Mr. Hamilton,) has been found to Avork satisfactorily to all parties con cerned, although of course every year's additional experience suggests some further amendation. According to tbe existing law, the intending miner haAing determined upon the site of his future operations, it not being preoccupied by an- other, may in the first instance apply at the department of mines for either a prospecting license or a lease, There is no limit to the extent of ground that he may apply for. To obtain a prospecting license he must pay at the rate of fifty cents per acre; and where the ground applied for is not Crown land, must enter into a bond to reimburse thc proprietor thereof forany damage that may be done to his land. This license holds good for three months, but is renewable for a further term of three months upon the prepayment of 25 cents per acre. This gives him the excliisiAre right to explore on the whole tract applied for, and select any part, or the Avhole of it, upon which to carry on mining operations. Before entering upon any such mining operations, he must, whether he has preAiously held a prospecting license or not, apply for a lease of such unoccupied ground as he may have selected for his purpose. Ou making such application he is required to pay at the rate of $2 for each area of 250 feet in length by 150 feet in breadth, and also, Avhen the ground applied for is private property, to make an arrangement with the OAvner of the soil for any damages the latter is likely to sustain. There- upon he receiA'es a lease for 21 years, rescuing a royalty of 2 J per cent. upon all the gold mined. The law further requires him to have labor performed annually at the rate of 100 days' Avork for every 250 by 150 feet leased by him, and to furnish quarterly and swear to a return show- ing, among other things, the amount of work and wheu performed, the quantity of quartz mined, the mill to whicii it was sent, and the quan- tity of gold obtained from it. Any person is liable to a heavy fine Avho runs a quartz-mill without a license. Before obtaining This license, for which there is no charge, he must give bonds Avith ample sureties for the performance of his duties as required by laAV. The licensed mill- owner must every month make and swear to a return showing the quan- tity of quartz crushed, the mine whence it came, and the quantity of gold taken from it; and out of this gold he himself pays to the mines department the royalty reserved by law, receiving three percent, out of that royalty as commission for his trouble."], [226, "214 RELATIONS OF GOA'ERNMENTS TO MINING. Under the law thus described by its author, about $3,000,000 have been extracted from the gold mines of NoAra Scotia Avithin the past six years. He says the law Avorks satisfactorily; but the slow development of the mines under it leaves room for the suspicion that its burdens are too heavy for this industry to support. Certainly the province of Ontario has found the taxation of mines a source of no revenue, but a cause of much ruin to mining. In February or March, 1868, the legislative assembly passed an act of extraordinary character, Avhich, besides fixing in a very arbitrary manner the size and shape of mining claims, and providing that both alluvial and quartz mines should be bounded by vertical planes in depth, limited the period of lease to one year, made the lease liable to forfeiture by one week's intermission in the Avorking, and imposed a royalty upon all gold and silver mines, whether on crown lands or private property, of not less than two nor more than 10 per cent, of the gross amount of gold and silver mined. Fortunately the lieutenant governor was empowered to fix the tax betweeu these limits, and even to grant mineral lands by order in council, on any terms he might see fit to prescribe. I presume the' experience of a single summer has been sufficient to show the unwisdom of this law. At all events, it has been repealed, almost or quite unanimously, at the session of the assembly which closed a few days ago, (December, 1868;) and an act* has been passed abolishing all royalties, taxes, and duties imposed by any previous patents, and rescinding all reservations of gold and silyer mines con- tained in previous grants. The fee simple of the minerals is made over to the owner of the soil, and no reservation or exception of gold, silver, iron, copper, or other mines or minerals may hereafter be inserted iu any patent from the crown granting lands sold as mining lands. Explo- ration for minerals on crown lands is declared free to all persons, and actual mining may be carried on upon crown lands, either by the pur- chase of the ground as mining land or by the procurement of a miner's license. The license must be renewed annually, is not transferable, and authorizes the licensee personally, and not through another or others, to mine during one year from the date of said license on any unsold croAvn lands within the mining division therein mentioned, and not for the time being marked or staked out aud occupied by any other licensee. Each mining claim on a vein shall be 200 feet along the vein, by 100 feet on each side thereof, measuring from the centre of the vein or lode. Companies of tAvo or more persons, Avho each hold a miner's license, may stake out and work additional feet along a lode by the above width, in the proportion of 100 additional feet in length for every additional miner, not to exceed 1,000 feet iu length altogether, and work the claim jointly. Mining claims shall be laid out as far as possible uniformly, and in quadrilateral and rectangular shapes ; measurements of all mining claims shall be horizontal, and the ground included in every such claim shall be deemed to be bounded under the surface by lines vertical to the horizon. These provisions indicate that deep mining is as yet unknown in thc province. If mining claims are to be bounded beneath the surface by vertical planes, then 100 feet on each side of the vein is too little for the security of the miner. However, all this arrangement of mining under license is evidently intended for individuals without capital, and such * This account is based upon a copy of the act as introduced by the ministry.

Ihe tendency of the law will be to encourage the purchase of mineral lands from the crown, since that releases the owner from all necessity for license, or limitation of claim by a fixed standard of surface measure ment. This is a beneficial tendency, unless it goes so far as to lock up the entire territory in the hands of surface-owners and prevent all independent mining. The laws of Canada, as will be seen from these examples, are fundamentally the same as those of England, modified by old grants of the crown, and by the legislation of the different provinces. The general character of that legislation hitherto has not been very favorable to a rapid development of mining, but the new and more liberal policy is gaining ground, and doubtless the example of Ontario will be followed by other proAinces. The principal reform\u2014 a release of the miners from onerous taxation\u2014 once effected, other necessary or advisable improvements will follow as they are dictated by experience. CHAPTER XXXII. CONCLUSIONS. History gives us a partial explanation of the causes which have made Germany, ever since the middle ages, the school of the world in the art of mining. In that country, and we might almost say in that country alone, has mining been pursued for centuries, comparatively undisturbed by wars and conquests, and continually fostered by the state, and assisted by the progressive science of each succeeding age. In laws, in histories, in her miners' dialect, and, above all, in the not yet obliterated traces of ancient operations, Germany presents to us a complete and instructive picture of the mining industry of the past, whilst her numer- ous and well-appointed schools, with their armies of accomplished grad- uates, her local populations of (so to speak) hereditary miners, her wise and elaborate system of legislation for mines, and her multifarious manu- factures, based upon mining, keep her still the foremost nation of Christ- endom, if not in every branch of this industry, or in all the steps of invention and progress which attend it, yet at least in its general stabil- ity and settled economy, and in its harmonious relations to other forms of organized labor as a recognized element in the prosperity of the state. Spain had once an excellent mining code; but it Avas based upon an incomplete science, and upon institutions of labor which haA*e passed or are passing away7; and the Spanish code (familiar to us as the present system of Mexico) has stood still Avhile the world adA*anced. England has a vast and productive mining industry; and English statesmen are not slow to recognize its importance as the foundation of the commercial power of that country. But the intricacies and local complications of English laAV are proA*erbial, and the mining codes are no exception to the rule. We can probably copy little from England, save those principles of common laAV Avhich we have already. France has the most modern system, (if we except our own, which is as yet scarcely worthy of the name,) for the clean sweep of the Code Napoleon did not spare the ancient regulations which fettered the mining industry of that nation. But France has unfortunately few metal mines, and her experience can afford us, therefore, but little light. It is to Germany that Ave must look for our best models of legislation, as of applied science. No popular notion is moi e erroneous than that which ascribes to the Germans, as a"], [228, "216 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. people, learning without practical skill and tact ; and nothing can more strikingly illustrate the error of this impression than the manner in which the Germans have brought to bear upon the art of mining the sciences of chemistry, mechanics, mathematics, law, and political economy. It is not, however, by closely imitating the course of any nation that we can successfully establish an American system. The one thing to be studied in all nations is the degree of wisdom with Avhich they have adapted their legislation to their circumstances; and it should always be borne in mind that we occupy a position widely different from that of a state bound by precedents and privileges, and, at the same time, pos- sessed of greater central poAver than democratic governments can or should ever acquire, Our American system cannot be a delicately balanced and nicely administered one: the hoofs of each new party riding into power would trample such workmanship to pieces. It must be broad, simple, and, as far as possible, automatic, Our institutions are not like philosophical apparatus, closely watched and often adjusted; they are rather like the ocean, lashed by storms aud swayed by mighty tides, yet keeping its own level after all, and asking no man to supply its deficiency or drain its surplus. It is no small task to apply the teachings of history and the examples of successful states to these new conditions ; yet it were folly to forget those teachings, and, blindly disdaining all examples, to blunder forward in a path Avhere every false step Avastes the energies and delays the pro- gress of a great people. I think the foregoing analysis and historical summary proA*es the truth of certain principles, which harmonize also with the democratic pobey of this country. Among these I would name the folloAving : 1. The assertion of any right of royalty in the precious metals is un- founded in nature, and unwise in practice. The most enlightened natious have abandoned the idea of anything more than a general supremacy of the state ovTer mining in the interest of the people. 2. The benefits derived by government from the mines must be indi- rect. No tax for revenue should be laid on mining any more than on agriculture. Taxes sufficient to cover the cost of the necessaryr super- Aision of thc mining interest are, properly enough, levied in all natious except the United States. We had a bullion tax, aud spent none of it for the miners ; noAv we haA^e no tax, Avhich is better, at least, than the former system. 3. The question, whether the go vernment should sell the mines or only license their Avorking, is to be answered, in this country, in favor of the first alternative, uuless we are prepared to establish and administer a vast mining system over our scattered districts. I think the true course is to alienate the mines from the United States as soon as possible, and to do this upon a general and uniform policy, preventing the necessity of special legislation. 4. The manner of conveying titles to the mines should be so regulated as to avoid as far as possible all litigation in future, and at the same time encourage mining. For, it must be remembered, in surrendering the title to the mines wholly to the patentee, Ave remove that stimulus to their development Avhich the conditions of the possessory title for merly maintained ; aud Ave can only rely on the natural laws of supply and demand to secure the continued working of the mines. According to those laws, profit limits production, and mining must be profitable to the individual, if it is to be continued for any length of time. Noav, pass ing a title to the miner which is indefinite or ambiguous, and brings him into conflict with his neighbor, is laying a heavy burden on mining, and so, without gain to any one, diminishing the product of bullion."], [229, "217 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 5. The nature of the property conveyed is such that ordinary measure ments cannot always define it. The Spanish and English laws, as I have shown, invariably bound mining claims by vertical planes, just as the property of land-owners is bounded. The modern Prussian law does the same thing. But according to the present codes of other German states, and the ancient codes of all, inclined locations may be granted, with the right to folloAv the vein in depth, Avithout reference to the surface oavii ership. Tbe American miners' law is unlike either, aud, so far as 1 know, has no parallel in history. It comprehends the vein, its dips, spurs,* and angles, to any depth ; and under this provision, Avhen two A*eins are found to meet in depth, the oldest location is held to be the main lode, and the other is confiscated as a \" spur.\" There is no justice in such a provision. On the other hand, there is no limit in American local regu lations as to the distance between parallel locations, Avhich, no matter how closely they lie together, are presumed to be on different veius until proAred to be on the same. This state of things both invites and pro tracts a litigation which is seldom settled except by exhaustion aud compromise. There are not wanting those who urge the adoption of \" square loca tions\" exclusiAely, as the cure for these evils. But withsuch. after mature reflection, I cannot agree. The great aim of the. government in dispos ing of its mines should be to secure their permanent and systematic Avorking. To define the boundaries of mining ground byr vertical planes does indeed lessen the danger of litigation, but it also lesseus the value of the claim ; and, in most cases, the value thus subtracted from one property is not added to anyr other. Thus a miner under the Spanish law loses the right to work his A*ein, because at the depth of 600 feet it passes out of his surface boundaries into the neighboring claim ; but the neighbor is not much better off for knowing that 600 feet beloAv the surface i he may find a vein of ore. To the miner Avho has already reached that depth, it is valuable ; to the miner Avho must dig and blast 600 feet to find it, it may be worth nothing. Meanwhile, it is undoubtedly for the interest of the country that the work should be continued in depth ; and the proper person to carry it on is evidently the one who has commenced it and prosecuted it thus far. The Spanish precedent I have already- discussed elsewhere, and shown that its effect has not been favorable to permanent mining. England and Prussia present more modern and plausible systems. Prussia is most deserving of attention, since in that country the inclined location has been abolished, and it is natural to suppose that experience has proved its inferiority. This cannot be accepted, however, without due consideration of the circumstances of the case. Mining has been carried on in Germany for centuries. We may safely assume that every mining district is thoroughly studied and known. The local peculiarities of the veins are understood ; and it is not difficult to locate a surface claim so that it will cover the ground upon a vein to the greatest depth to which mining cau be carried. Besides, most of the mines are already opened ; many of them are Avorked under inclined locations of the old sort ; and these are not interfered Avith. Iu the United States, on the other hand, Ave are comparatively igno rant of the peculiarities of our mining districts, and our mineral veins have shown themselves in many, I might almost say in most, cases, to vary in dip to an extraordinary degree. The veins of Lander Hill may be cited as an example. Some of them dip at the outcrop 00\u00b0 below the * The word spur is omitted from the United States law of 1366, but the sweeping recog- nition in that law of \"mining customs \" virtually restores it."], [230, "218 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. horizon, and, at a depth of 300 feet, are found to run for a considerable distance almost horizontally. Only very large square locations, tracts of 40 acres at least, could cover such mining ground ; and I consider it impracticable to grant the mineral lands containing gold and silver in such parcels, though, no doubt, capitalists Avould prefer such large areas.* For the present stage of mining in this country, as for the earlier stages of mining iu Germany, the inclined location must be accepted as the best for lodes. But it does not folloAv that the boundaries of an inclined location can not be defined at all. They used to be so in Europe, aud they may be so in this country. The location should giA-e the right to a certain dis tance each side of the A-ein, so many feet in the hanging wall, and so many in the foot-wall. When two claims cross in depth, the elder loca tion simply holds its course through the other, taking only so many feet away, and leaving to the second party the right of way to follow and find'his A-ein again. If one claim joins another in depth, the two being branches of the same A-ein, the elder location takes the whole in depth, but does not take the \" spur\" above the junction, except so far as its right extends in the two Avails. At the same time, the surface location of veins should be regulated bylaw, and the making of neAv parallel locations close to older ones should not be allowed. Of this I shall speak presently. 6. Although history abundantly7 shows that mining flourishes best when the property in minerals is distinguished from the ownership of the soil, it seems to me good policy for the United States, in selling the mines, to sell also the surface. In most cases the land Avill never be taken up for agricultural purposes, and if the miner does not buy it no one will. I do not mean that the OAvnership of minerals shall go inva riably with the soil, but that, where the United States has both for sale, both should be sold to the same party, Avho may aftenvards dispose of either as he likes. The present law partially recognizes this policy by selling inclined locations at so much per acre. Under one interpretation of this rule, the same acre may be sold OA*er and over again, and, strictly speaking, not belong to any of the purchasers, since all they receive is the right to use it for mining purposes. The foregoing conclusions will be better understood in their applica tion to American mining after a brief analysis of the United States law. For au able commentary upon the law, and the earlier instructions under it, issued from the General Land Office, I would refer to the inter esting work of Mr. Gregory Yale, of San Francisco, on miniug titles and water rights in California, I shall not go minutely into the analy sis on the present occasion, since it is rather my purpose to suggest amendments to the law than to discuss constructions of it. The first and second sections of the law of 1806 proAide for two classes of miners in this country. The first section licenses all miners upon the public domain. They are not trespassers, neither are they owners ; they are simply licensed to mine, under such regulations as may be pre scribed by law or agreed upon among themseh-es. The second section makes it possible for certain persons or associations to step out of the class of licensed miners into that of actual proprietors. This section distinctly applies to veins or lodes only, t and leaves all placer, gulch, * Let any one attempt to calculate the value of a square location of 40 acres on the Com stock, or Lander Hill, or Treasure Hill, at White. Pine I t A recent decision of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, includes placer, gravel, and cement mines under the operation of section 2. The words of the chairman of the Com mittee on Mines and Mining, in reporting the bill to the Senate, May 28, 1866, were : \" By this bill it is only proposed to dispose of the vein mines. * * * * It ia not proposed to"], [231, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 219 hydraulic, and cement miners, together with all those who do not acquire patents to veins, on the broad ground established by the first section. Nor does the second section make it obligatory upon any person to acquire a title to the vein of gold, silver, cinnabar, or copper he may be Avorking under the general license of the first section. The second section declares that a diagram may be filed, conforming to the local laws, customs, and rules of miners, and a tract entered and patented, together with the right to folloAV the vein, &c. This, it seems to me, distinctly conveys the surface ownership to the patentee, together with the right of inclined location. But the mining customs do not recognize a surface ownership, vested in the miner, and hence much confusion has arisen, since the law leaves the size of the \" tract \" to be determined by local customs. Nor is confusion the worst result that may be expected. Miners will begin to make regulations expressly to influ ence the subsequent operation of the patent law. It is said that the only patent thus far issued is one conveying several hundred acres of laud, the \"custom\" having been, no doubt, conveniently established for the oc casion. Section third provides, among other things, that no plat, survey, or description filed for patent shall cover more than one vein or lode. Under this provision what is the status of a vein existing, but not discovered until after the patent has issued, within the borders of a certain tract ? If the vein was previously known, then the patent could not issue for the tract covering it, and the boundaries of each tract must be so drawn as to exclude all veins except the one on which the patent is applied for ; but if the second vein is discovered within the tract patented, I think the legal position is this : the patentee owns a piece of land, and the mineral right to one vein, cropping out on the surface within his property. The United States, which formerly owned both surface and mineral, still owns all other veins within the tract, except the one patented, and under the spirit of the first section any one may mine upou the other veins, simply paying damages, not royalty, to the patentee. Recommendations. \u2014 I have the honor to recommend, as necessary amendments of the present lawr, the following provisions : The size of the tract decided by patent and the number of feet upon the lode should be fixed bylaw, in spite of all conflicting miners' customs. Vested rights must be adjusted by agreement among owners; but it should be at once announced that the United States will hereafter regard the locator of a vein as entitled to claim, say, 200 feet on each side of the vein ; that no other locations subsequently made within that distance will be recognized as pateutable; that subsequent locations made within less than 200 feet of the boundary of the first location will be shorn of so much of their width on that side, being limited by the elder locations ; that the patentee shall pay to the United States, say, $5 per acre for his land, and a fee of, say, $10 for each separate vein dis covered and worked within the tract, after the first vein, upon which the interfere with, or impose any tax upon, the miners engaged in working placer mines.\" The words of the law are. \" vein or lode of quartz, or other rock in place, bearing gold, silver, cin nabar, or copper \" There is no possible construction of these words which will include placer mines, or alluvial deposits, or beds. The Commissioner argues that there are different kinds of veins, and that it is difficult to decide how a vein was ormed\u2014 all of which does not touch the case. Amid all the discussions of geologists about vein-formation, the distinction between all veins and alluvial deposits bas never been disturbed. It is found in the earliest laws, and is perfectly comprehended by ihe ordinary miner. The United States law of 1866 cannot be applied to mines of the latter class ; it was an experiment, applied only to \" quartz mining, and the attempt of the Land Office to extend it over placers, before a single quartz mine has received a patent under it, only tends to bring the whole law into contempt."], [232, "220 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. issuance of the patent is based. The right to follow the vein, its dips, variations and angles should remain unaltered, and all ores found within 30 feet of the vein iu the hanging or foot wall should be considered as belonging to it. In a case .vhere two veins cross in depth the elder location should keep its right to 30 feet in either wall ; if the veins unite and become one the elder location woidd take the whole vein below the junction, but not the whole spur above, being restricted on that side to its right of 30 feet. It is true that this system would not prevent all collision of interests. A aud B might, for instance, locate side by side on parallel veins 400 feet apart, and each might subsequently discover a vein within his tract near the boundary line between them. In working these they might find themselves close together and liable to interfere. But in such a case it would at 1 feast be only a question between A and B, not between them aud a score of piratical locators, only intent on mischief ; and dis putes arising between owners in this way would be much easier to settle by compromise than the present class of suits, where oue party has nothing to lose and everything to gain. Besides, no patent should be granted until the vein first located is sufficiently developed to show its course aud width. Until that has been done the miner should be con tent to work under the free license granted by the United States; and when that has been done the chances of subsequent discoveries of valu able aud separate veins within 200 feet are in most districts not very great. In fact, the majority of the \" float locations\" made under present customs iu the immediate neighborhood of developed veins are worth less, except for purposes of black-mail, robbery, and litigation ; and if the privilege of working such subsidiary out-crops belonged only to the patentee of the vein in the centre of the tract they would never be worked. Again, the conditions on which the possessory title depends should be made uniform in all the mining districts ; aud I am of opinion that in no case should claims be held without being worked a reasonable period every year. The present chaotic state of the practice in this respect is described by a committee of the Nevada legislature as follows : In one district the work required to be done to hold a claim is nominal ; in another, exor bitant ; in another, abolished ; in another, adjourned from year to year. A stranger, seeking to ascertain the law, is surprised to learn that there is no satisfactory public record to which he can refer; no public officer to whom he may apply who is under any bond or obligation to furnish him information or guarantee its authenticity. Often in the newer districts he finds there is not the semblance of a code, but a simple resolution, adopting the code of some other district, which may be a hundred miles distant.* My predecessor repeatedly urged this point ; and in the absence of the necessary federal legislation the evil has certainly not diminished. I think the provisions ofthe \"quartz laws\" of Nevada county, California, might be adopted in this regard, with advantage, as the universal rule. They require work to the extent of $100 in value, or twenty days' faith ful labor, each year, and make the regularly elected and sworn county clerk or recorder the mining recorder also. The spirit of the law should be to prevent all parties from holding claims who do not mean to work them. This is a legitimate sequence of the position in which the United States law places such parties. They have free permission to mine, not to \"squat,\" and prevent other people from mining. They should not treat the mines as their property until they have bought them from the United States. It is said, \" sometimes the miner, having found a vein, is obliged to wait for capital or for better times to work it.\" But if he has a bona fide intention to work he can do as much as will hold his * For a full statement of these evils see the report of the committee, quoted in J. Ross Browne's report for 1867, page 221."], [233, "221 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. claim. The secret of much opposition to such a wholesome provision is that those to whom the United States generously gives the free license to mine do not wish to mine, but to speculate. A feAv men organize a district, locate hundreds of thousands of feet, pass laws to protect their \"rights,\" and then, by working one or two rich veins, try to attract a population and sell out their claims. The law is not intended to protect speculators of any class. Nor should patents be granted on veins not opened and traced. When a man has chosen a vein, worked it to the extent of $1,000 expenditure, and determined to buy it, he is entitled to the special protection of the second section of the law. There need be no difficulty in executing these provisions. If miners do not desire to enter the class of ovraers, they can remain licensed to prospect aud mine ou the public domain; but the protection afforded by such provisions as I have recommended against piratical locations would make applications for patents Aery numerous, especially in new districts. Nor is there any hardship in excluding later locations within 200 feet of the original one. We grant a man the right to own and Avork a vein which he has discoA-ered, because we assume that he expended skill and labor in the discoAery, and that his Avorking will benefit the public. But these considerations do not apply to the individual avIio makes haste to follow the discoAerer, and \"locates\" the nearest piece of quartz, hoping either to find by chance the main lode, (the discoverer having found by skill and labor only- a spur or branch of it,) or else to get down to the A-ein located by the discoverer, and extract a quantity of rich ore before, by- the sIoav process of drifting along tbe vein into his stopes, it can be proA-ed that he is a trespasser. I could adduce many instances in whicii men haAe sunk vertical shafts to cut a rich deposit Which did not belong to them, and, Avhile they were taking out large quantities of valuable ore and turning it into money, coolly said to the real claimant, \"You tell us this is y-our A-ein : prove it, and we Avill give it up at ouce.\" The courts inA-ariably demand that kind of proof which requires a connection to be made between the works of the claimants, either by surface cuts or by drifts under ground, and, so far as I know, never award any damages ou account of the ore whicii the intruder, finally ejected, may haAe extracted and sold \"in good faith.\" The present law gives no greater security to capi talists than the mining* customs, for under the latter a company could at least locate all the outcrops in its neighborhood, and so prevent piratical locations ; and that is the most that can be done under the law. The patent must cover but one vein, but the patent is kept from being made worthless by interference and litigation only through innumerable sur rounding locations made by the patentee ! Is this Avhat Ave call securing the title of the miner ? What are these mining customs to which the law pays such sweeping respect . They are edicts passed at 24 hours' notice by mass meetings of from five to\" 500 men ; it requires no more formalities to abolish or amend them than it did to make them \u2014 a notice pasted on a door, a \" mass meeting\" next day, and the thing is done. The records of titles are kept by an officer called the recorder, not known to the laAV nor answerable for malfeasance in office, except that if he were known to tamper with the books iu his charge his life might lie taken by the party wronged. The records are kept in a few districts iu fire-proof offices and in suitable form, but more frequently in small blank-books, pocket-books, or scraps of paper, stoAved away under the counter or behind the flour barrel or the stove of a store or bar-room. These are not exaggerations. The title to millions of dollars' worth of property depends ou records no"], [234, "222 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. better cared for than this. The whole record book for the Philadelphia district, NeA-ada, was burnt up, and tbe district \"jumped;\" and the game Avould have succeeded but for the unusual circumstance that a second copy of the records was in existence. If I am correctly informed, this second copy Avas only a partial one, and there was a good deal of litiga tion and trouble, iuA-olving some bloodshed, as the result of attempts to enforce old claims on oral testimony. The Sheba mine, in Humboldt county, is another instance (see account of that mine) of the shifting and \u25a0unrecorded nature of these mining laws. In regard to the size of claims and the tenure by which they are to be held, it is best to make one uniform federal law, overriding these regulations. I haA-e the honor to recommend also, as an advisable addition to the laAV, that the United States deputy surv-eyor under the act shall be required to examine whether a mineral deposit proposed to be patented is a vein or not. If not, the same area shall be deeded as before, but Avithout the right to follow the vein out of the limits of vertical planes from the surface boundaries. And I recommend in general an extension of the law to coA-er placer claims, by providing that such claims may be sold by surface area, in \"square locations.\" The question of size is not A-ital, since it regulates itself. After the United States has once sold two adjacent properties, it cannot prevent their being united. Hence, by combination and by different purchases, companies will be able to acquire as much land as they desire. Iu carrying out any such measures, no conflict with the miners is to be feared. The law is not compulsory. It simply opens the door to admit members of the licensed class (which includes all citizens and those who have declared their intention to become such) to enter the class of patentees by purchase, (which may include also aliens.) The motive applied is an improAement of the title. The miners' or posses sory title, in spite of its frequently vaunted validity, is not one upon which money can be safely lent. It is a curious fact that miners can hardly ever borrow money to develop their claims, while they frequently sell the claims, undeveloped, for much more than they failed to borrow. The insecurity of the mining title lies in this: that an absentee owner or mortgagor is at the mercy, 1st, of the laAvs which the miners may at any time enact; and, 2d, of the agent on whose compliance Avith those laws his whole title depends. A capitalist in San Francisco lent to a miner from the interior $10,000 in gold, to help him develop a very promising gold mine, and took a mortgage on the mine as security. The miner returned to the district Avhere the property was located, stopped Avork for a certain number of days, and allowed the mine to be \"jumped\" or re-located as abandoned by a friend of his own. The friend became, by miners' law, the owner; the two rascals divided $10,000 between them ; and the capitalist was left to muse upou the instability of the \"possessory title.\" The substitution of a perfect title for this shifting one is a benefit to every poor miner. It will enable him to borrow money on his mine, a much better course than to hurry a sale of it to some speculative com pany before its value is half determined. The miners Avill hasten to avail themselves of the provisions of the law if it is made easy for them to do so. But the expense, delay, perplexity, and contradictory decis ions which have hitherto marked the administration of it have pro duced discouragement aud indifference. The present law is not operating at all ; therefore the question of its benefits can hardly be ausAvered. But I think that such amendments as I have suggested, together with one more practically important,"], [235, "223 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. would remoA-e most of the present difficulties in its way. The latter touches the questiou of expense. The compensation of deputy surveyors under the law is notoriously inadequate, especially in tbe new and sparsely settled districts. (See letters included in the chapter on Montana.) The result is that the miners are subjected to extra legal expense, or the work is not properly done. In AieAv of the fact that new mines should be encourtiged, and that producing mines should bear the expense (as theyy do eAerywhere else in the Avorld) of the system devised for their own good, I recommend a bullion tax of one-quarter of one per cent, to be applied, one-half to the necessary expenses of mineral surveys over aud above the present legal fees, and one-half to the maintenance of a national school of mines, on the plan set forth in another chapter."], [236, "SECTION VII. MINING EDUCATION. CHAPTER XXXIII. MEANS OF DISSEMINATING INFORMATION WITH REGAED TO MINING METALLURGY. The object of the government in taking measures for the spread of in formation concerning the mineral resources of the country and the proper methods for their exploitation is three-fold. The first end served is to in crease the confidence of its oavu citizens in the natural wealth of the coun try, and to augment the credit of the country throughout the world. One reason why the credit of the United States is so much lower than that of other nations far less able to pay their debts, is the fact that this nation makes no such thorough periodical exhibits of its sources of strength as do European states. In other words, they advertise more than we do; and their immense statistical official publications haAe a fine effect upon their financial standing with the world. A second good result from the spread of the kind of information alluded to above, is the communication of valuable advice and knowledge, to the mining popula tions, rendering the business of miniug more profitable, and thereby en couraging an increased production of bullion. The third object to be attained is the protection of the country against reckless aud wasteful mining, by the inculcation of sound principles, and the enlightenment of the miners as to their own best interests. This is not in the nature of a lesson, forced upon them, but of a boou which they desire and would gratefully Avelcome. The means by which the government can act in this important matter are three: a commissioner, a bureau, and a national school. I shall briefly discuss the first tAvo, and pass to a more detailed consideration of the third. The provision of Congress, under which Mr. J. Boss Browne and myself have served, was certainly a measure of great benefit, so far as it went. No one can deny that the two reports of 18G7 and 1868 throw a great deal of light upon the previously obscure and almost fabulous subject of the mineral resources of the country. The eagerness with which they haAe been sought for by the citizeus of all the States, ex hausting the official editions, and justifying the publication of editions by private houses besides, is a proof of the estimation in which they tire held by tbe people. Both those reports, and the present one, were too much occupied with a presentation of the resources of the country west of the Rocky mountains, and of the general condition and prospects of the mining* industry, to leaAe space for the discussion of topics more directly instructive to the miners theinseh-es ; but if the work is con tinued, future reports may deal with such topics, and no doubt consider able good would arise from the discussion. But while many things which the commissioner attempts to do are necessary to be done* I do not think that he can coA-er the Avhole ground. He cannot receive and replv to"], [237, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 225 letters from miners who desire advice ; he cannot serve as a medium for exchanging information. To do that, he must haA-e clerks and a bureau. Now there are many reasons which make a national bureau of mines desirable, and, in default of any better means, necessary; but I am decidedly of opinion that the duties of both commissioner and bureau, and a great many more beside, could be best and most economi cally performed by a national school. To this subject I have given much attention, and I deem it one of the most important that can be brought before Congress for consideration. All attempts to enlighten our miners, aud preserve from Avaste and ruin our mines, will be but partially successful, unless Ave can establish a living and progressive agency of intelligence in their midst, Tbe advan tages to be gained by the creation of such a school as the bill of Senator Stewart, introduced last year, proposes, may be enumerated as fohWs: 1. It would give us the right kind of scientific engineers and metallur gists. The excellence of many foreign schools is acknowledged, and numerous American students attend them to obtain that education in the arts of mining and metallurgy which they need to practice at home. But, while the principles of theoretical science remain eAerywhere the same, all questions of the best modes of applying those principles A-ary with circumstances. The economy of different methods and processes is so intimately connected with the price of labor and fuel that the pro cess Avhich is the best in one country is cast aside in another. It is a severe requisition that we make upon a young graduate of a foreign school of mines, when we ask him to adapt his acquired science at once to our widely different circumstances. EAery such graduate has to reconstruct, alone and for himself, the whole art Avhich he has learned \u2014 a work requiring genius as Avell as intelligent perseverance, and one in which many- men fail, who, if they had been educated in the region where they were to practice, would have been respectably and deservedly success ful all their liAes. A school of mines Avould speedily give us a settled and digested American science of mining and metallurgy, and the reproach that has beeu cast upon science would pass away. It is undeniable that many of those now engaged in mining sneer at educated engineers, the graduates of foreign schools. This contempt is partly justified by the failure of foreign engineers and metallurgists to adapt their ideas to our conditions; but it is mainly unjustifiable. Many charlatans have imposed upon the credulity of the public by parading the names of foreign schools \u2014 like that Isenbeck, aa-1io professed to prac tice upon black rock ores the \" Freiberg flux process;\" but that is no reason for despising really well educated men. Another great cause of this feeling is *:he fault of the public. When American (or foreign) young men come here from the schools of Europe to take part iu mining, the true wisdom is to give them subordinate positions at the mines, where they may gradually learn the new conditions of the problem, and fit themselves for higher positions. They are generally good surveyors, assayers, and draughtsmen. But the general rule has beeu to take such young and inexperienced men as superintendents, or, worse yet, send them as experts, to inspect totally undeveloped mining lands, and say whether they will \"pay dividends ou judicious investment of capital.\" Now, of all the branches of knowledge in the world, this one of prophe sying the future of a newly discovered mineral deposit in a newly opened territory is not and cannot be taught in a school. It requires the basis of a thorough education, coupled with years of field experience, and a familiar acquaintance with the locality examined. Besides, men fresh from countries Avhere ores are worked much more cheaply than here, H. Ex. Doc. 54 15"], [238, "226 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. would naturally be tempted to consider veins \u2022\u2022 highly promising,' or \" very rich,\" whicii Avere only so according to foreign standards. Their flattering reports once made, their services were no longer needed ; and unskilled overseers proceeded to waste what little chance of profit there might be in the case. No wonder that when the mistakes of scientific, but not practical, and practical, but not scientific men are heaped together upon the head of science, they seem to cover her with shame. But all this arises from the notion that there is something recondite and approaching sorcery in the sciences of geology, mineralogy, and metallurgy. Iu fact, science is merely knowledge, and knowledge is power. Let every miner have a chance to hear lectures and Avituess experiments iu the sciences which interest his calling, and he would conceive for science a true respect, equally removed from the vulgar superstition on the one hand, and the boorish contempt on the other, with which she is too often regarded. Then our thoroughly trained American engineers would be received with confidence by the people, and they would justify that confidence by inaugurating aud maintaining reforms in miuing and metallurgy, increasing both the gross product and the net profit of our mines, and securing the future by wise forethought. None of the objections urged against foreign schools hold good against a national school among our owu mines. 2. It would serve all the purposes for whicii a commissioner is now appointed. The Avork of compiliug statistics aDd other information for the use of Congress and the people is expressly turned over to the faculty of the school by the terms of the bill; and their annual reports would no doubt be more Araluable than the opinions and statements of any single man. The professors are also enjoined to travel through the mining districts, and address popular and instructive lectures to the miners \u2014 both parties gaining by this acquaintanceship. 3. It would serve all the purposes of a bureau or department of mines. The delays and difficulties which haAe arisen in the administration of the mining law by the General Land Office show how hard it is to manage such matters at such a distance. For an industry so constantly progres siAe as that of mining, the best kind of bureau is a school; because that remains always in A'ital connection Avith the people, hears of the latest improvements, tries experiments, publishes results \u2014 is, in short, in sym pathy with the work for Avhich its pupils are trained. 4. It Avould tend to unite different sections of the country, the mining interests of which are now separate aud isolated. The interests of miners arc. alike. The miners in Oregon and in New Mexico are wrestling Avith essentially the same problems as those of Colorado aud Carolina. What they, need is one central point to whicii all experience shall gather, and from which light may radiate to all. The scientific collections, apparatus and library of such au institution would be worth more to the country than a score of inferior ones, costing iu the aggregate ten times as much. This is one reason why the work cannot be left to private enterprise, or State liberality. No one private or State school can command the support .and collect the experience of all the mining communities. For that, a national school is required. It has been shown by experience in other countries that such a school, deAoted to the miuing sciences only, and maintained by the state, has a powerful influence on the productiveness and permanence of the mining industry, Avhile a mere department in some . institution of learning, or a school smothered in a capital, away from the mining regions, has never been found to affect so widely the actual work of mining, although, no doubt, such endowments do much good. Let us have as many private schools, State schools and college schools as can"], [239, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 227 be supported; they will all succeed the better for the existence of that of Avhich none of them can take the place\u2014 a national school among the mining regions. I no not underrate the advantages of private schools. On the contrary, I highly esteem them and rejoice in their prosperity. The school of Columbia College, New York, the Sheffield School of New Haven, the Reusselaer Institute at Troy, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Pardee scientific department of Lafayette College, Penn- sylvania, have all given considerable space to mining and metallurgy; and the first is devoted entirely to the branches of theoretical and applied science which relate to the extraction and beneficiation of useful minerals. Now there is work enough in the United States for twenty local mining- schools, one iu every State or Territory where mining is carried on ; but there is neither room nor need at present for more than one national school, to stand in the midst of all local institutions, to concentrate and utilize the efforts of all. Such a school would simply take the place of the foreign academies to which our young men are now obliged to go, after they have learned what can be' taught them here; and as soon as it shall thus become possible to complete a thorough course tcithout the expense of a foreign residence, our mining schools, great and small, would have twenty students where they now have one. 5. Such an institution is more and more urgently needed every year, because the difficulties of mining in the Pacific States and Territories are constantly increasing. The steady annual decliue of bullion product is partly due, as I have elsewhere remarked, to this cause. An aAerage uniform product is only to be attained by a system of mining which does more than merely extract the richest ores and then abandon the miues. It is a significant fact, that the largest part of the bullion from lode- mining this year comes from the same mines that furnished it last year, and the year before, and the year before that. Mines like the Eureka of Amador, and the Eureka, North Star, Empire, aud others of Grass Valley, would be much more common if skill and wisdom were more com- mon among miners. Individual enterprise might in time correct this evd ; but it has not yet done so, and we cannot afford to wait for so slow a reform nor to pay its frightful cost. The Aery extent of our mining territory is a fatal inducement to avoid rather than to OAercome the grow- ing difficulties of the work. It is so much easier for ignorant men to try their luck on virgin ground than to continue the exploration of ground already open, that in the absence of an organized effort to enlighten the people ou this subject, Ave may expect to see our Arast mining fields over- run and pillaged before an earnest and systematic development is under- taken. The praiseworthy efforts of single men to stem the tide tire almost insignificant in comparison with the general tendency. One might as Avell expect the Indian to commence stock -Raising while the prairie swarms with buffalo. He cuts out the hump and the tongue, throws away carcass and hide, and laughs at all notions of economy and indus- try. A despotic government would stop this waste by arbitrary- meas- ures ; but the democratic policy of moral suasion by education is at once more feasible and more effectual. 6. An objection has been advanced which is plausible enough to merit a brief reply. It is said that the government is not called upon to inter- fere, simply because individuals are not successful iu mining, any more than in case of depression in any other business. This objectiou con founds the distinction between individual aud national loss. In point of fact, I think that indiAiduals or companies have lost less money in miniug this year than last, and less last than the year before. Mining is regulating itself according to the laws of self-interest. Those who are"], [240, "228 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. not making money for the time being stop; only the best mines will bo worked, and those only in such parts and for such periods as will secure the quickest and largest dividends. It is safe to say that not more than one-quarter of this year's bullion product has been obtained at a profit over and above costs; while, balancing tlie whole yield against the whole outlay, there is no profit left. The tendency of individual enterprise is naturally to abandon all the unprofitable mines, thus reducing the yield to one-quarter of its present amount \u2014 a reduction which could not be wholly compensated by robbing newly explored districts of their surface ores. It is the country, not individuals, that loses by such a course; aud any measure which promises to encourage individuals to persevere, and offers them the means of obtaining that exchange of experience and impartation of knowledge which will render their work (so important to the country) profitable to themselves, is worthy of serious attention. It is a measure of national policy, not a \"governmental interference.\" The value of a national school of mines being acknowledged, it becomes a question of importance where it shall be located. That it ought to be, as the bill of Senator Stewart provides, west of the Eocky mountains, is evident from the following, among other reasons: It is the gold and silver mining industry which needs support, is most closely connected with the national credit and welfare, and gets, at present, the least aid from any quarter. The government does not own the iron and copper lands in the east, and is not directly interested in their product. Yet they are protected whde gold and silver are not, nor can be, except by such a measure as this. Besides, the older States are better pro vided already with educational facilities. Again, the Pacific States and Territories have, and will continue to have, a large and growing- population interested in mining; they will furnish numerous students to such a school, and the school in return will gain in efficiency by its location in the midst of the mining districts. This is indispensable, if the provision requiring the professors to travel every year among the mines is to be made effective. A miners' meeting, held at Nevada City, near Grass Valley, last summer, passed the following resolutions, which, I think, express very clearly the sub stance of this matter: Resolved, That we cordially recognize the importance to our mining industry of a national school of mines on the Pacific slope, substantially upon the plan advocated by the Secietary of the Treasury and J. Ross Browne, late United States commissioner of mining statistics, and embodied in the bill now betore the United States Senate. Resolved, That such a school, to exert its full measure of influence and achieve complete success, must be situated iu the immediate vicinity of mining and metallurgical operations, so as to combine the benefits of actual practice with those of scientific instruction ; and that we will not, so long as this fundamental condition is fulfilled, embarrass this important measure by the assertion of particular local interests; and we call upon the miners of the Pacific States and Territories to support the plan iu a similar spirit of liberality. The choice of location is wisely left to the directors of the institution. I venture to suggest that for the first year or two no permanent selection need be made. The erection of buildings would entail a considerable expense, which might better be avoided at the outset. Eegardiug the enterprise as an experiment, (however oui' hopes for its success are forti fied by reason, analogy, aud history,) I think that place should be chosen for a commencement which offers the best advantages for the time being, such as accessibdity to students, neighborhood of well-managed mines and reduction-works, and cheapness of living. The abolition of the bullion tax raises the question, how the school is to be supported. Before considering this, I would say a word or two concerning the probable expenses of the enterprise. The bill in its pres ent form (see report of J. Eoss Browne, 1868,) contemplates a large"], [241, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 229 expenditure at the outset. This might, no doubt, insure an earlier maturity, but it is not absolutely necessary. As I have already sug- gested, the cost of permanent buildings may be avoided for the present, by a temporary location aud employment of cheap or hired buildings. It is not necessary to make instruction absolutely free. The national min- ing school of Saxony is managed upon a compromise system. The students do uot pay all the expense, but they do bear a part of it, and the gov- ernment supplies the deficit. In the present iustauce, an equitable and acceptable arrangement is not difficult. There are certain expenses, such as the salaries of the principal instructors, procurement of collections, library, &c, which are necessary and constant, whatever be the number of students. There are other expenses, which vary with the number of students, such as the cost of laboratory accommodations, the salaries of assistants, etc. It seems fair that moderate fees should be received from the students, to cover expenses of the latter class ; and as the number of students increased, these fees might amount to such a sum as materi- ally to reduce the proportion paid by the government. The directors should fix these charges with care, low enough to offer no hindrance to any7 who desired the benefits of instruction, aud high enough to coA-er the variable expenses alluded to, and to insure appreciation of the priv- ileges offered. Even aside from the saving to the government, I think this plan would increase the efficiency- of the school. The sum of $100,000 currency, judiciously expended, would be sufficient, in my opin- ion, to put the school in operation with the most necessary collections, apparatus, &c; and the annual cost of maintaining it (apart from the erection of buUdings) need not exceed that amount, the expenses inci- dent to the increase of students being coAered by fees. I recommend that $100,000 be appropriated for this purpose for the first year. Sub- sequently, perhaps some acceptable plan could be adopted, bjT means of Avhich the mining industry itself might bear a portion of the expense. A bullion tax of one-eighth of one per cent, would cover the Avhole, and be an insignificant burden, besides affording, what is now lacking, a ready indication of the prosperity and productiveness of the mines every year. If the Sutro tunnel is constructed by government aid, a portion of its revenues might be annually set aside by laAV for this purpose ; but for the present an appropriation is the most direct means. I believe the nature of the object would justify this in any event ; but it is especially reasonable in Aiew of the fact that considerably more than a million dol- lars has been paid by the miners withiu the last four years, in the shape of a special tax ou bullion. In view of the Avhole relation of government to miniug, discussed in a former chapter, I claim that such a tax is only justified when its proceeds are applied for the benefit of the mining industry; and hence the appropriation asked, for the establishment ofa national school of mines, is but a slight return for the extra burden which has been imposed upon mining. In conclusion, I would urge the importance of immediate action upon this subject. It will be at least a year before the school, on the most moderate scale, can be put in operation, and the necessity for it grows stronger every day. If we delay uutil threatened evils are actually upon us, if Ave allow our country to recede from her foremost position among mining nations, Ave cannot excuse ourselves. On the other hand, a timely support to this industry will strengthen the hands of others, stimulate the settlement of our vast territory and the organization of stable com- munities upon it, and secure the future material progress of the country. The history of the world proves that all nations eminent for profitable and permanent mining have employed two agencies for success\u2014 a"], [242, "230 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. national mining code and a national miniug school. These the United States must have. I append accounts of several European schools, which will serve to show the nature and compass of their activity. The schools of London, Schemnitz, Leoben, Fahlun, and other places also deserve attention; and, in fact, a thorough study of the organizations of foreign schools should precede the adoption in detail of a plan for our own. Such an examina tion is provided for by the bill of Senator Stewart, establishing a natioual school of mines. CHAPTER XXXIV. THE FREIBERG SCHOOL OF MINES. Bv Benjamin Smith La*man, of Philadelphia. In view of the probable establishment before long of a national school of mines in America, it is worth while to look at similar schools in other countries. The folloAving account of the Freiberg mining school AA-as published fiA-e years ago, in a newspaper not specially deveted to mining interests, and has long been out of print. Few important changes there have taken place since then. The younger Weissbach has become pro fessor of mineralogy in place of Breithaupt, and has from illness been compelled for some months past to interrupt his teaching. The number of Americans at the school has greatly increased, and was 35 a year ago, and is perhaps eA-en greater now. It would be well if former students of the Berlin and London mining schools, or of those at Clausthal, Liege, St. Etienne, Prizibram, Schem nitz, Leoben, and elsewhere, Avould likeAvise give the American public some account of these institutions. The Royal Saxon Mining School, or academy (Bergakademie.) now 97 years old, is situated at Freiberg, 25 miles south Avest of Dresden. It is surrounded for miles by mines, chiefly of lead and siher, that have been worked for 000 years, and is within two or three miles of two large smelting works. Freiberg is a toAvn of 17,000 inhabitants, and has re cently- been connected Avith Dresden by railroad. The smelting works near Freiberg and some of the mines belong, as Avell as the school, to the gOA'ernment, and the rest of the mines and furnaces throughout Saxony are thoroughly under government control, so that not only are very good opportunities giAen the students of Aisiting the mines and furnaces and of Avorking practically at them for their instruction, but the OAersight of all these Avorks, in the interest of their proprietors or of the govern ment, gives permanent employment of many grades and kinds to Saxon graduates of the school. There are about 140 students at the academy ; less than half of them are native Saxons. State students. \u2014 About fiAe-sixths of the native students receive aid from the government ; that is, they pay only $37 (American money) yearly for tuition. In return, they are required to pass examinations ancl are carefully watched OAer in their studies ; and they bind themselves not to settle outside of Saxony after graduation Avithout paying all that"], [243, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 231 has been remitted to them by the government on the score of instruction or otherwise. Admission to the school.\u2014 Free State students, as they may be called, must apply for admission to the school as earlv as the end of February ; they must show by their birth certificate that they are between the ages of 10 and 23 ; they must bring a physician's testimonial of health, strength, and soundness, and a certificate of vaccination ; they must bring written testimonials oftheir good character up to the date of their application ; if under age, they must briug a certificate from parents or guardian of approval of the application ; their previous education must fit them for the profitable pursuit of the studies they desire to pursue, and in the absence of satisfactory certificates to that effect from certain public institutions they must pass au examination. This examination is about equivalent to that required for admission to Harvard College, and includes algebra and geometry, equations ofthe first and second degree, stereometry, plane trigonometry, and the use of logarithms. Some facil ity in drawing, and a good, neat, legible handwriting, are also required ; and some knowledge of French and English is considered an advantage. If the applicant comes from a school where Latin is not taught, the ex amination in this is omitted, but that in the mathematical and practical branches is made the more strict. Preparatory mining course. \u2014 After a satisfactory examination of this kind, the student has to spend four months in following a preparatory practical course at the mines. For the first four weeks he must spend at the mines som* six-hour shifts each week, aud for the rest of the course five a week. The first eight weeks are spent on tbe mechanical prepa ration of the ores ; the next six in practical work of different kinds in the mine, such as drilling and hammering stone ; one week iu seeinghow the ore is raised from the mine ; and from one to two weeks in observa tion of the A-arious timbering and masonry Avork in the mines. Duriug the course the student is helped to information in every detail by the OAerseer of the mine or his subordinates, and a report is made out monthly- to an appointed academical instructor of the student's regular ity, industry, zeal, and behavior. The student must also hand in, every month, to the same instructor, a complete journal of his daily work, its object, and what he has been taught about it, as well as his owu observa tions. At the same time he has to pursue at the school certain prepara tory' studies in mathematics and drawing. Neglect of the duties during this course, or a betrayal of physical uiititness for the fatigues of a miner's life, may yet prevent the student from entering the school. But if the course is satisfactorily finished, he has to spend the remaining time until the beginning of the academical lectures in getting- generally ori ented in regard to the mines by visiting them under the special direction of the aforementioned instructor, and from time to time iu his company. Those students who haAe already Avorked a year practically in mines are excused from the practical preparatory course, but not from at least two months of this general orientation. Preparatory metallurgical course.\u2014 There is also a preparatory metal lurgical course that must be attended in the long vacation by those stu dents who wish to hear the lectures on metallurgy the following year. This preparatory metallurgical course begins about the first of August and lasts four weeks. The students meet every morning at six or seven o'clock at one of the smelting works, and have to write down, at the dic tation of an instructor, a detailed description of the different metallur gical processes and operations. The rest of the morning is spent in visit ing in company with the instructor the different parts of the works."], [244, "232 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. Each student must hand in, weekly, to this instructor a journal, contain- ing not only the dictations but original observations and explanatory drawings; and this journal is handed iu at the end of the course to the professor of metallurgy. Academical instruction. \u2014 The students are encouraged to continue their visits to the mines and furnaces uear Freiberg throughout the year, espe- cially on Mondays, when there are for that very purpose as few academical exercises as possible ; and in the ATacations they can make excursions to more distant works. The most deserving of the students receiAe state aid for the longer excursions, and so travel into distant countries in the long vacation. In the spring and summer the professors themselves occasionally conduct excursions of a half day or a whole one, or of two or three days, to furnaces and mines, and to points of geological interest, and they sometimes make a long vacation journey with a few students. The academical lectures are given in yearly courses that begin on the first Tuesday of October and end with the last week of the following July, Avith vacations of about two weeks at Christmas, Easter, and Whit- suntide, and with pretty frequent single holidays. The number of years to be spent at the academy by a student is not prescribed, but is com- monly three or four. The student is also free to choose the courses of lectures that he will attend; but he must make known in writing at the beginning of June his choice for the following year, aud that choice must be in accordance with the final examination that he intends to pass, and with the progressive nature of the studies themselves. The students tire obliged to take notes of the lectures and their accom- panying* practical exercises, and to exhibit a journal of the same from time to time to the several professors. During each course, of lectures there is now and then a recitation in order that the professor may know the success of his lessons aud tbe diligence of his pupils. At the end of July a public yearly examination of the students all together is made, and at this their journals, exercises, drawings, and the like are all exhibited as proof of their industry. This is, however, a parade or exhibition rather than an examination. If a student wishes to leave the academy, he must announce his intention, and he may have a testi- monial. At the end of the whole course of study the student avIio wishes to enter the service of the state must pass the state examination, as it is called. State examination.\u2014 The state examination takes place in October, but notice of intending to pass it must be given before the end of June. Not more than three candidates are examined at once, and the examina- tion is open only to tlie students and certain officials, and to the relatives of the candidates. The examination is of four kinds: for those Avho wish to become miners, surveyors, constructors, and metallurgists. The miners are examined in mineralogy, geology (with ore deposits,) mining, elementary mechanics, bookkeeping, mining law, general sur veying, physics, drawing. They must show, too, that they have diligently followed the courses on practical surveying, general chemistry, metal lurgy, and civil architecture. In default of such showing they must be examined in these branches. The surveyors are examined in general and special surveying, miner- alogy, but only in the most important characters, geology, ore deposits mining law, drawing, physics. They must bring, too, good testimonials oi their attendance on the courses on mining. The constructors are examined in mining, physics, civil architecture bookkeeping, general surveying, drawing, higher mathematics, elemen tary mechanics, construction of machines. They must haAe heard also the courses on general chemistry, metallurgy, mineralogy, aud geology'"], [245, "233 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. The metallurgists are examined in theoretical and analytical chemistry, dry and Avet assaying and blow-piping, metallurgy, physics, mineralogy, elementary mechanics, mechanical preparation of ores, bookkeeping, drawing. They must have heard the courses on geology, civil architec ture, mining law, and miniug. The candidates of all kinds must bring to the examination large drawings already made. One day is spent in making the oral examina tion in the different branches. On the second day is made an examina tion in drawing, principally in sketching after the models or after oral descriptions; also in writing short original papers on given subjects, to be finished in a short time, in connection Avith the performances in draw ing. The third day is given to an examination of the metallurgist in practical assaying. Moreover, the candidates of all kinds must have handed in before the end of September a paper on a subject that has been given them at the time of their announcing their intention to stand the examination. The examination in each branch is declared \"excel lent,\" \"good,\" or \"satisfactory;\" and if \"satisfactory\" is not obtained in a single branch, the candidate cannot be admitted to the practical course, but may try the examination again the next year. Practical courses. \u2014 After the State examination, those who wish to practice their profession iu Saxony must spend a whole year in practical work at the mines, or, if they are metallurgists, at the Royal Smelting Works. During the year at the mines they must practice all the differ ent kinds of work, from the lowest to the highest, including that of OAer seers, two, four, eight, or twelve weeks at a time. They must go daily to the work, and remain at it during a full shift ; and are paid for their labor $1 12\u00a3 a week. They are required to hand in monthly a brief journal of then* daily work. They must not turn their attention to other branches of study or work than that they haAe selected; but they may be allowed, from time to time, to visit other mines when something special is to be learned of importance. Those who Avish to enter the serA-ice of the Royal Smelting Works must work there half a year at the practical metallurgical operations, and another half year at the Avork of the differeut officials of the establishment. They must remain daily at the furnaces from six in the morning until four ; they are paid at the rate of $1 12^ a week. If their work does not prove satisfactory, they are dropped from the employment of the government, and sent away from the furnaces. Those metallurgists Avho do not wish to join the service of the Royal Smelting Works are not allowed to spend more than eight Aveeks in practical work at the furnaces, and receive no pay for their work. Subsequent employment. \u2014 Three of the best metallurgists are selected at the end of the year's course, in case their services are requued, to assist the officials, aud to continue at the furnaces as before. The others may receive permanent employment elsewhere, and, while waiting, are paid $1 12^ a week; or, if they must wait long, or are especially deserving, $1 50~aweek. Those who wish to practice the profession of surveying must, after the state examination and the year's practical work in the mines, perform a given trial piece of surveying, lasting several months aud testing thor oughly their professional capacity. The rest at the end of the year's practice are employed in various mining or geological matters, according to each one's special fitness, until some permanent position is found for them. Those Avho intend to study laAV at the university after their min ing studies must announce this intention before entering the mining academy, and must pass, either before that, or after leaving the academy,"], [246, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 234 the ordinary examination for admission to the university. They are not obliged to go through with the year's practical work after the state exam ination. . Independent students.\u2014 The students who receive no aid from the gov ernment ha ve to pay from $ 7 50 to $22 50 for each course of lectures, besides an annual fee of $11 to the academy; so that an industrious student of this class has to pav commonly $75 or $100 a year for his instruction. In order to be admitted to the academy, these students must be more than 16 years old; they must bring testimonials of good character up to the time of their coming there, as well as testimonials of fitness to pur sue the intended academical studies; and if they are Saxons, they must bring their birth certificate. They are allowed to take part, if they choose, in the practical preparatory mining and metallurgical courses, and iu the recitations and other exercises of the course, as well as iu the yearly and state examinations ; but those preparatory courses and the state examination must be speciady paid for. These students are also aUowed \u2014 two at a time \u2014 to have a practical course of eight w eeks at the smelting works. Before leaving the academy they must announce their intention to do so, and they may have a testimonial to take away with them. The professors. \u2014 There are 13 academical instructors, and they give in all <i3 courses. They receive themselves the money that is paid for their courses by the students. Most of the instructors hold also other posi tions uuder the government connected with the mining or metallurgical interests of the state. Breithaupt gives the courses on mineralogy, on crystallography, and ou the paragenesis of minerals. Weissbach gives two courses on elementary mechanics, (one general, the other with reference to mining ;) a theoretical course, and a practical one on the construction of machines, and a course on general surveying. Gaetzschmaun gives two courses on mining. Von Cotta gives a course ou geology, one on paleontology, and one on ore deposits. Scheerer gives a course ou theoretical chemistry; one on practical chem istry,(qualitative analysis, and preparations ;) one on analytical chemistry, aud one on the metallurgy of iron. The last two chemical courses are accompanied by practical exercises in the laboratory. Junge gives two courses on mathematics, (one on cubic and undeter mined equations with alligation, progressions with interest, plane and spherical trigonometry, analytical geometry ; the other on the elements of the differential and integral calculuses with their applications, and the principles of higher mechanics : one on descriptive geometry, and one on practical surveying. The last is accompanied by practical exer cises in the mines aud above ground, and in the plotting room. Fritzsche gives a course on metallurgy, one on assaying by the dry way, aud one on assaying by the wet way. The courses on assaying are accompanied by practical exercises in the metallurgical laboratory. Heuchler gives a course on civd architecture, aud the instruction in drawing. Kressner gives a course on mining law, and one on mining business style of writing. Eichter gives a course on the blow-pipe, accompanied by practical exercises. Proelss gives instruction in French. Albiu Weissbach (the son) gives a course on physics, and one of prac tical exercises in mineralogy."], [247, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 235 Gottschalk gives instructions in bookkeeping. The buildings and collections. \u2014 There are three buildings occupied by the academy ; the principal one, the metallurgical laboratorv, close by, and the chemical laboratory, at a distance from the other two.\" The prin cipal building contains three lecture-rooms, a large mineralogical codec tion, a geological collection, a collection of machine models and a shop for making them, a large library, a shop for the sale of minerals, the dwelling of the superintendent of the academy, that of the janitor, and a few other rooms, including the academical prison. The metallurgical laboratory building contains laboratories for dry and wet assays, and for the blow-pipe practical exercises, a large room for the office work of the surveying exercises, and a lecture-room. The chemical laboratory build ing contains, besides the laboratory, a lecture-room and the dwelling of the professor. The mineralogical collection is open to the students two or three days in the week ; and, as the minerals are mostly in drawers, these drawers are opened for the students by one of the mineralogical professors. A separate small collection of, say, a thousand specimens of minerals is usde for the course of practical mineralogical exercises, and the students are allowed to handle them freely. Admission to the geological collection can be obtained at almost any time, aud also to that of machine models. The library is open twice a week, and books can either be consulted there or taken out and kept several weeks. The discipline. \u2014 The academy, under the finance department of the state, has uow its owu police and its own criminal court, and punishes violations of its oavti laws ; and its discipline extends over all the students without exception. Its biAvs forbid to the students immoral behavior in general ; noise in the academical buildings during the lectures; gaming and drinking bouts ; disturbance of the public quiet ; large meetings, for pleasure, or fencing, or anything else, without special leave ; extravagant living aud accumulating debts; fighting; challenging; duelling; defamation ; neg ligence of studies ; encouraging others to negligence ; neglect of the regulations about Aisiting the mines or furnaces ; neglect of the special directions of mining or furnace officials; walking alone in the mines; firing off the holes drilled for blasting ; selling minerals ; iujuring any thing in the library, collections, or laboratories. The punishments are reprimanding, either by an instructor in the name of the rest, or in the presence of the teachers' meeting, or in presence of the academical court ; reporting to parents or guardian ; setting tasks for whole or part of the vacations ; imprisonment from one day to a week, or from one week to four, either during the daytime only, or day and night; withdrawal of state aid in Avhole or in part, temporarily or permanently; threatening of advice to leave the academy; advising to leave the academy, either for a time or forever; expulsion from the academy and town \u2014 either simple expulsion, or expulsion together with a public announcement of it. Moreover, a combination of several of these punishments may be inflicted. BehaAior at the academy may also affect the future position of a student who enters the service of the state. The students are alloAved to have societies among themselves, provided they are not for political purposes ; and the chief officer of each society must report to the academical authorities a list of its officers and mem bers, and state its place and time of meeting. There are three such societies."], [248, "236 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. American and English students at Freiberg* \u2014 The following list, com piled from official records, includes all Americans and Englishmen who studied tit the Freiberg academy from its foundation in 1766 to its cen- teuial, 1866. It will serve not only to show to what extent these coun- tries are indebted to Saxony for the education of their sons, but also to expose the swindlers who pretend to come from Freiberg. The absence from this list of the name of any American or Englishman who claims to have studied at the academy before the year 1866 wiU be conclusive proof of the falsity of his claim : The preceding account of the Freiburg school of mines, and the following chapter on the Pans school both the work of Mr. Lyinan, are extracted from the columns of the American Journal of Mining, published in New York city.

The French imperial mining school (Eeoie Imperiale des Mines) at Paris was first founded in 1783. The special object of its instruction is the mining aud working of minerals ; also, the study of steam machi nery, the discovery and care of mineral springs, drainage and irrigation, building and running of railroads, and in general the arts and occupa tions conuected with mineral manufactures. The instruction includes the branches of machinery, metallurgy, mineral chemistry, mineralogy, paleontology, geology, (both pure and applied to agriculture,) adminis trative law, mining and manufacturing laws, as well as the principles of construction needed in the practice of government mining engineers and of managers of mines and furnaces. The students of the school, the instruction, the management and dis cipline, aud the building and collections will be spoken of in turn. The whole number of students is little more than a hundred, and is made up of government students, outside students, foreign students, and free students. Government students, (ele'ves ingenieurs.) \u2014 The government students are taken only from the graduating class of the polytechnic school. These graduates are allowed, in the order of their school rank, to choose which branch of the government service they wdl go into ; and it almost always happens that the full number of places in the mining school is filled by the very highest scholars. The number taken each year depends upon the demands of the service ; half a dozen years ago the yearly number for several years was six, but of late it has been only three. Their age on entering the mining school averages more than twenty-one years. After graduating at the mining school they become ordinary mining Country, as given at entrance. Year of entrance. Name.

The higher grades, to which they may rise in course of time, are : ordinary mining engineers of the second and first class, mining engineers-in-chief of the second and first class, and general mining inspectors of the second and first class. The ordinary engineers have charge of the mining and railroad interests of the government, and the inspection of steam boilers, in larger or smaller districts, according- to their rank ; the engineers-in-chief have, in like manner, the oversight of several such districts ; and five of the general inspectors, who are in all only about a dozen in number, have charge of the five great divisions of the whole of France. Moreover, the care of the Paris mining school, and of the two other lower mining schools of France, and other special duties, give occupation to a few of the miuing engineers of almost every grade. The whole number of mining engineers in the service of the government is about 130, and there are about 20 more on unlimited leave of absence, or in the service of companies, making about 150 in all. The government students have a salary of 100 francs a month, and, during journeys, 150 francs a month, besides an outfit of 100 francs, and eight francs for eAery day of traAelling. Outside students, (eleves externes.) \u2014 The outside students are intended to become managers of mines aud furnaces iu the owners' interest. They are admitted to the school on a competitiAe examination, and have the same instruction and practical exercises as the government students. A preparatory year of instruction is also provided for those who Avish to become outside students, but are not fitted for admission to the studies of the first year. A candidate for admission to the preparatory year, Avith the view of becoming an outside student, must be French by birth or by naturaliza tion, and at least 16 years old, and at most 2'2 on the foregoing lst of January. His application must be sent to the minister of agriculture, commerce, and public works by the lst of September, and be accom panied by a birth certificate, and, if need be, his naturalization papers ; by a certificate of good character from the authorities of his dwelling place ; by a physician's certificate of having been \\-accinated, or having had the small-pox, and, if need be, by an official certificate that the pre liminary examination is unnecessary. This preliminary examination is made before the middle of October by goAernment mining engineers designated for the purpose, and must be passed by till candidates, except those who have passed the examination at the end of the first year of the polytechnic school. The final examination is made at Paris, in the first half of November, by the council of the mining school. The candidate must Avrite and spell well, and must know arithmetic, algebra, geometry, plane trigonometry, analytical geometry, descriptive geometry, and phys ics, and must be able to draw from copies. There are commonly per haps 15 French students folloAving the studies of the preparatory year. Candidates for admission as outside students to the studies of the first year must be French, in like manner, and a year older than the candi dates for the preparatory year\u2014 that is, about 18 at least on the opening of the school term in November. They must also hand in their appli cation iu the same way together with similar certificates; aud all must likewise pass a preliminary examination, except those who are gradu ates of the polytechnic school, or are licentiates of the mathematical sciences, or have passed the examination at the end of the preparatory year. The final examination is made by the council of the school in the first half of November. The requirements are good handwriting and good spelling, a knowledge of the differential and integral calculus, of"], [252, "240 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. mechanics, of descriptive geometry and its applications, of those parts of physics that treat more especially of gases and of optical instruments, of general chemistry, and geometrical drawing, and water-color washing. Before the examination each candidate must hand in at the school a page of French written from dictation, five drawings of descriptive geometry, (exercises on the straight line and the plane, solution of three principal cases of trihedral angles, tangent plane to a surface of revolu tion, sectlou of an oblique cone by a plane, development of a truncated cone, intersection of two cylinders,) three drawings of stone cutting, (an oblique door in a battering wall, a straight descending vault, an unclosed winding staircase,) a drawing of carpentry, (a roof of truss with all the pieces in detail,) a washed drawing of a screw and nut shaded. About 20 outside students are admitted every year to the studies of the first year, and about 12 every year receive diplomas at the end of their studies. Foreign students, (eleves etrangers.) \u2014 Foreigners are permitted to share in the instruction of the school in all its branches, including the preparatory year ; and are admitted, without examination, on the simple recommendation of the ambassador at Paris of each applicant's govern ment. Of course it is desirable for all students to have the same fitting and age as the French students have, in order to profit by the studies of the school. Foreign students can have places in the labratory and in the drawing-room, only in case places happen to be vacant there. They may pass the same examinations as the government students, and are expected to pass one of them each year ; and at the end of their studies they may have a certificate of the manner in which they have studied, and of their examination marks; but no diploma is given them, and they haAe no right to practice the profession in France, except as assistants of French engineers. The foreign students are subject to the same discipline as the French, but are less cared about and less closely watched over, so that they do pretty much as they like. Half a dozen years ago, the number of foreign students in the preparatory year was perhaps a dozen; in the first and second year of the regular course, about half a dozen, and in the third year, three or four. There are com monly two or three Americans among the foreign students of the school. Free students, (eleves libres.J \u2014 Besides the above-mentioned students, others, called free students, are allowed to take such portions of the school instructions as they- may choose, but are required to pass at least one examination each year. They have much the same priAilges as the foreign students, and, like them, receive no diploma at the end of their studies. The free students are few, perhaps a dozen in the whole school. The instruction. \u2014 The instruction is three years long, (besides the pre paratory year,) and is given in lectures, (without recitations,) practical exercises in chemistry, drawing, mineralogy and paleontology, and in occasional excursions. With French generosity, it is made quite free of cost to all the students, French and foreign alike ; and the lectures on mineralogy, geology and paleontology are open to the public. The stu dents of the second and third years have to travel in mining regions in their long summer vacations. The students are not left to grope in their ignorance for a fitting arrangement of their studies, but a Avell-planned regular course of study is prescribed, and things are learned in their proper connection, a matter of great importance. Preparatory year. \u2014 The instruction ofthe prepatory year begins at the middle of November and lasts until the end of summer."], [253, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 241 Professor Haton de la Goupilliere (ordinary engineer of the first class) lectures on the differential and integral culculus and in mathematics. Professor Fuchs (ordinary engineer, second class) lectures on descriptive geometry aud the parts of physics that treat specifically of dynamical electricity and optics. Professor Moissenet (ordinary engineer, first class) lectures on general chemistry. The students of the preparatory year also practice geometrical draw ing and water-color washing under Mr. Amoroux, the drawing-master of the school. First and second years.\u2014 The lecture courses of the first and second years are given together ; that is, some of them are two years long, and the students who enter the school one year begin Avith the second part of the course of those Avho entered the previous year ; but the lecture courses are so arranged that some begin one year and some the next. The courses that are only one year long alternate with each other, so as to be equal in number each year. It is necessary, therefore, to be at the school at least two years in order to get the most important part of the instruction. Ten lectures of about 16 hours in all are given each week, and the courses last from the middle of November until the middle of April. Gruner, (general inspector, second class,) professor of metallurgy, giAes a two-year lecture course, that begins the even years, (1860, for example,) with general metallurgy, furnaces, fuels, and the like, and iron ; and the next year takes up copper, lead, silver, gold, quicksilver, tin, antimony, bismuth, and zinc. Bivot, (engineer-in-chief, second class,) professor of mineral chemistry, gives a two year lecture course, that begbis iu the odd years, with the metalloids, alcalis, and earths, together with cements, mortars, mineral Avaters, soils, and manures ; aud the next year treats of the metals. He has also charge of the laboratory, Avhere each student works in periods of three weeks at a time, alternating with the drawing exercises. In the laboratory the students begin with making preparations of different bodies, and then make analyses and dry assays. A Avritten account of the laboratory work is required from the student. Daubree (engineer-in-chief, first class) is professor of mineralogy, in the place held half a dozen years ago by the much lamented De Senar mont. The lecture course is only one year long, but it is repeated every year, and it is expected that the students generally will follow it two years running before getting the needful practical familiarity with the minerals. A few, hoAvever, are able to pass the examination satisfac torily at the end of the first year. Besides the lectures, there are, for some weeks before the examination, practical exercises in the presence of the professor. Caiion (eugineer-in-chief, first class) is professor of mining and machinery, and gives a one-year course on each of these subjects in alternate years, beginning the one in mining on the odd years, and the one on machinery the eAen years. Elie de Beaumont (general inspector, first class) is professor of geol ogy but he gives only four or five of the lectures himself, and the rest are 'given by his colleague, Mr. De Chancourtois (engineer-in-chief, first class.) The lecture course is but one year long, but it is repeated every year, and the examination comes at the end of the second year, and hearing the lectures is only required that year. Besides these lectures, there are, in the spring, Aveekly excursions of a whole day in the neigh borhood Avith both these professors. After the spring examinations are H. Ex.

Ou this yearly excursion, Ebe de Beau mont himself takes the lead, and does it most admirably ; long may he be spared the strength for such fatiguing labors! The party numbers some forty, counting the professors and two or three of their assistants and friends and the students, to all of Avhoni transportation is furnished free. Bayle (engineer-in-chief, second class) is professor of paleontology. He began with paleozoic fossils in 1859 ; and iu 1860 took up secondary fossils; and in 1861, probably, went on with tertiary fossils, making really a three-year course of it. The student, however, is required to follow this course only through the first year ; but as the examination does not come until the end of the second year, together with the geo logical examination, he finds it to his interest, if only for that reason, to hear the lectures of both years. Professor Fuchs (ordinary engineer, second class) teaches surveying, with practical exercises aboAe ground and iu the catacombs under ground, iu the summer. betAveen the first and second years lectures. The draAviug exercises of the first and second year under Mr. Amour oux, cousist of machine draAving from copies and from real machines, plotting, mapping; and later, in the second year, in making original drawings in solution of given problems in mining, machinery or metal lurgy. Third year. \u2014 The lectures of the thu*d year are comparatively few in number, aud mostly on subjects of less iuterest and importance to for eign mining engineers than the lectures of the other two years. Couche (engiueer-in-chief, first class) is professor of construction, and lectures on railroads and machine construction. Professor Laine-Fleurs (engineer-in-chief, second class) lectures on min ing laws. Professor Delesse (engiueer-in-chief, second class) lectures on agri culture, drainage and irrigation. Excursions are sometimes made to large farms in the country. The drawing exercises of the third year are original designs connected Avith the solution of problems iu mining, machinery or metallurgy. Mr. Schlessiuger teaches German to the students of every year; but the study of it is optional, and few study it after the first few days. Mr. Elwell teaches English, in like manner, to those of any year who choose to study it. Examinations. \u2014 The examinations at the ends of the lecture courses are both vrritten aud oral, aud a week is given to the examination iu each course. The Avritteu examination takes place in the library, and two or three questions are giAen to all the students together for each to answer. Each student may make use of his lecture notes or of any books he may* bring with him or find in the library ; and, if he wishes, he may- work upon the answers all through the day until four o'clock ; but the time required for his work is noted. The questions in metallurgy, one year, to giAe an example, were how to adjust the charges of two irou furnaces in order to produce good foundry iron in one and forge iron in the other, at less than certain giAen prices, Avith three ores, aud forge cinders of certain given composition and cost, and Avith labor of a certain giAen cost. The geological questions, one year, required a description of the coal measures proper, their characteristic structure, composition and fossils, and their difference from other coal formations ; also au account of the principal conditions in which limestone occurs on the globe, and"], [255, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 243 the origin of different limerocks ; also an account of the different tin ore deposits in the world, and the conjectures as to their probable mode of formation. The written examination in mineralogy consisted, under De Senarmont, of crystallographic computation. In the oral examinations the students are examined one at a time by the professor of each branch and a couple of other gentlemen, and the questioning lasts from teu minutes to half an horn*. In mineralogy the student is asked the names of six or eight materials placed before him. In geology and paleontology, he is tried in the same Avay with a few fossils as well as questioned on geological points, and required to explain a specimen or two of ore Aeins. The examinations of the second year include, also, the subject of the first year's lectures. Journeys. \u2014 Besides the geological and agricultural excursions already mentioned, the students of the second and third years have to travel for at least 100 days in the second half, that is, the summer of those years ; commonly two or three students together. They have to make known their plans beforehand, and have them approved of; and after their return, haAe to hand in a journal of AAiiat they have seen. Both French and foreign students are furnished with circular letters of introduction to the government mining engineers, and to all managers of mines and furnaces in France, who take pains to show all needful attentions to the students. In this way there is really as good a chance to see mines and furnaces to advantage as if the school were placed in a mining region, and a long period of time were specially set apart for this purpose. At the end of their studies those government students who have sepecially distinguished themselves at the school are allowed to travel for a time in foreign countries. Management. \u2014 The mining school is under the control ofthe ministry of agriculture, commerce, and public works, and is managed by a gen eral inspector of the first class, [now Mr. Combes,] who has the title of director of the school. Under him, a general inspector of the second class, [now Mr. Gruner,] or an engiiieer-in-cheif, is charged with the direction of the studies and the details of the management, aud has the title of inspector of the school. The council of the school, whicii meets at least once in two months, consists of the director and the inspector of the school, of two general inspectors, and ofthe professors; and it delib erates on the standing ofthe students, aud the cases of extreme punish ment, and arranges the lecture courses. Another council, called the improvement council, consists of the director of the school, a general inspector of the first class, two general inspectors of the second class, the inspector of the school, and two of the professors. It meets at least once a year, and its business is to consider the merits ofthe Avork ofthe students taken as a whole, and to propose improvements in the instruc tion of the school. Punishments.\u2014 The penalties that can be inflicted on the students are : a reprimand given either privately or in presence of their comrades, by the professors, by the inspector, or by the director of the school ; tem porary exclusion, for a week or fortnight, from the rooms for study, and from the laboratory or from the school ; public mention; censure by the council, with or without public mention ; delay of promotion from one class to the next ; final expulsion from the school. Hours.\u2014 The lectures are given at half-past nine m the morning and at noon, and there are in the first and second year, commonly, two each day The students are required to sign their name m a register before each lecture, and at half-past three in the afternoon. They may leave the school between the two lectures, or from half-past eleven to twelve, for their breakfast ; but they must stay there from noon until signing at"], [256, "244 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. half-past three. They can stay later if they like, and some work at their drawings bv lamplight. Rank.\u2014 The rank of the students is determined by their merit, taking account of their industry, their examinations, and their capacity shown in the practical exercises, and the journals of their journeys. Dress. \u2014 There is a uniform prescribed for the government students, but none for the others. The undress uniform is simply three narrow bands of gold lace around the cap. The building and collections. \u2014 The school with all its appurtenances is contained within one building, which contains also the dwellings of the director and inspector of the school ; but none of the students lodge at the school. Certain portions of the school have been built within the last half dozen years, and it is now handsomely furnished -.rith labora- tories, drawing-rooms, and rooms for the library and the mineralogical, geological, metallurgical and machine model collections. The collections of fossds and minerals are very large and fine ; and they are open to the students and to the public on certain days in the week. The specimens, except the duplicates, are in glass cases on the tables, so that they can be easily seen but not handled. There is a small collection of fossils and minerals that is always accessible to the students, aud can be freely handled. The large library is open daily and all day. The collections of the museum of natural history at the plant garden are also opeu to the public on certain days of the week, and are there- fore available, especially the fine collection of minerals, for the study of milling students. There are other mineralogical collections likewise accessible, iu the city, as well as libraries, machine models, laboratories, for private instruction under excellent chemists, and other valuable facilities for study ; to say nothing of the great benefit, both directly to the student and indirectly through its effect on the professors, of the presence in the city of a very large number of scientific men. Further details ofthe organization ofthe school may be found in the laws and decrees of the annales des mines for 1856; and details ofthe examinations for admission, in the same for 1861 and 1867. CHAPTEE XXXVI. THE PRUSSIAN ROYAL SCHOOL OF MINES AT BERLIN \u2014 BY W1LLARD P. WARD, M. E. Of this excellent institution but little is known in this country in comparison with the wide reputation of the Freiberg, Clausthal, and Paris schools. The main reasons for this are the comparative recentness of its foundation and the fact that it is not situated in a mining region. The practical part of a mining engineer's education is probably best gained by studying at a school situated in some great mining region, where be will see nothing but mines and hear nothing but mining mat ters discussed. On the other hand, there are many things which it is necessary for an educated miner to know which he can learn just as Avell in one place as another, so far as the advantages of location' are concerned. These are the kindred sciences of chemistry, geology, mineralogy, the theory of the treatment of ores, assaying, &c, Avhich are necessary to a rational system of mining. The large attendance of the excellent mining schools connected with Columbia College, the Troy Polytechnic, and others, shows that the Amer ican people appreciate the value of these sciences to the mining engineer."], [257, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 245 As every young man who is about to enter upon the study of mining, for one reasou or another, cannot go to Europe to spend three or four years there in prosecuting his studies, it is a fine thing for the country- to have these schools, which I believe to be excellent; and far be it from me to say anything to injure them in any way. Still some\u2014 partly be cause they appreciate the advantages of a European residence, and partly because they consider the advantages to be enjoyed there greater than those offered by the schools of this country\u2014 will go to Em-ope to study; aud to each a knowledge of the merits of the Berlin school may be of value. The advantage of being a member of this school consists not only in being able to hear the lectures and have the valuable advice and friend ship of the professors, but it gives one free entrance to all the mines and smelting Avorks of Prussia. So great is the courtesy of the Germans that almost anybody, on making* proper application, can see nearly- all their works ; but a letter of introduction from the director of the Berlin school will secure a degree of civility Avhich under other circumstances would be wanting, and admission to certain works which would other wise not be shoAvn at all, or shown in such a way that one would be but very little the Aviser after seeing them. With regard to the lectures it may be said that they are all of the best. The Prussian goA-ernment has spared no pains or money to give the students all the opportunities possible for obtaining a thorough theoreti cal and, so far as models and collections can be of assistance, practical knowledge of his profession. The student has the advantage in Berlin of being able to attend the lectures of Gustav Bose on mineralogy, whose name is almost as familliar to mineralogists as that of his lament ed brother, Henry Bose, is to chemists ; of Beyrich on geology, Avho is regarded by many in Germany as a second Cuvier iu the realms of paleontology ; and to make use of the large mineralogical and paleon tological collections of the largest university of Germany. The director of the school aud professor of mining, Hauchecorne, is a man of very extended practical knowledge in his branch. He has been for many- years a mining superintendent in Westphalia and Upper Silesia. Professor Kerl, on general smelting and assaying, is sufficiently Avell known, even in America, to render anything I could say of him super fluous. Professor Wedding, on iron smelting, has a large experience iu his subject, but is probably better knoAvn in England than in this country. Professor Bammelsberg, on mineral chemistry, aud Professor Hoffman, on general chemistry, are professionally, and through their books, well known in this country. Professor Werner, on machinery, is regarded as authority in Germany. Thc large and Avell-appointed laboratory is under the charge of Dr. Finkler, one of the most promising of ihe former pupils of Henry Bose. There are but few, if any, other schools Avhich possess such corps of instructors. In the summer vacation trips are made to various mining regions by the professors of metallurgy and mining accompanied by the students, the travelling expenses of the party being paid by the government. To the above general account I add the following, translated from official publications, for which 1 am indebted to Professor Bruno Kerl, of Berlin : REGULATIONS OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF MINES. \u00a7 1. Object.\u2014 The Royal Academy of Mines, at Berlin, is established for the purpose of affording to those who would educate themselves in the management of mining, metallurgical, or saline works, opportunity to obtain the necessary professional knowledge."], [258, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 246 \u00a7 2. Control and administration.\u2014 The academy is under the general control of a director, appointed by the King, and responsible to the minister of commerce, trade, and public works. The financial and sta tistical departments (bureau work) are conducted by officials ot the minis terial department of mines, furnaces, and saliues. \u00a7 3. Themratorium.\u2014 This consists of five members or curators, appoint ed by the King, and assists in the arrangement of the organization, the determination of the various coiuses, and the nomination of instructors. \u00a7 4. Duties of the director. \u2014 Besides the general management of the institution, the director has the following special functions : 1. The issuance of permissions to enjoy the benefits of the academy, according to the conditions in \u00a7\u00a7 10-12. 2. The superintendence of the systematic progress of lectures and instruction. 3. The control of collections and apparatus, (for which the instructors in each branch are primarily responsible,) and the preservation of budd ings and personal property. 4.

The transmission of annual accounts, and the reception and editing of notes and reports. 7. The rendition of annual reports. 8. The convocatiou of regular instructors, to consult upon the plan of instruction, and other matters relating thereto, as often as may be required, and at least semi-annually. \u00a7 5. Regular instruction. \u2014 Regular instructors (professors) are appointed by the minister of commerce, trade, and public works, on the nomination of the director and approval of the curatorium, for the principal subjects included in the courses, and are bound to deliver certain lectures and give certain instruction in their respectiAe branches. \u00a7 6. Extraordinary instruction. \u2014 Tbe director may also, with the consent of the curatorium, grant permission to anyregular instructor of the acad emy, to any professor or teacher of other institutions of learning, and to other duly qualified persons, to lecture upon special subjects. \u00a7 7. General plan of instruction. \u2014 The lectures at the academy continue from the 15th of October to the 15th of the following August, Avith an Easter vacation of three weeks. \u00a7 8. Subjects. \u2014 The following subjects are included in the plan of regular instruction : mines, salines, general metallurgy, metallurgy of iron, mechanics, machines, surveying, drawing, construction, projections and shadows, recitations and colloquies upon mineralogy, geognosy, and paleontology, and on mathematical processes, mining law, mineral chemistry, iron founding, mechanical technology of the metals, applied chemistry in the arts, blow-pipe assaying, general chemical analysis, Avith practical instruction in the laboratory, assaying in the dry and humid ways, theoretically and practically, &c, &c. A catalogue of the lectures and lecture fees is published semi-annually. \u00a7 9. Reception of students. \u2014 Permission to attend the academy is \"ranted by the director, according to the conditions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-12, uj>on application made during the first 14 days of the semester, and accompanied by the necessary attestations. This permission is endorsed upon the applica tion and given to the student by the registrar of the academy. \u00a7 10. (Qualifications of students. \u2014 The following have a right to be ad mitted to the' academy : 1. Those students of mines, furnaces, and salines, Avho desire to devote themselves to the Prussian government service."], [259, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 247 2. The matriculated students of the Royal Frederick William Universitv of Berlin. J 3. The matriculated students ofthe Boyal Academy of Practical Arts, (Geiverbe Akademie.) \u00a7 11. Admission of other students.\u2014 The director may also grant to other persons the permission to attend such lectures as they may name in their applications. \u00a7 12. Applications.\u2014 The students admitted according to \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11, note, in the proper column of the application blank, the lectures which they desire to attend during the semester, and deliver it to the registrar for signature. \u00a7 13. Fees. \u2014 Within four weeks after the beginning of the semester, (half year,) the applications (\u00a7 12) are to be handed in, the fees paid into the academical treasury, and the students are to report themselves to the instructors. \u00a7 14. No instructor is allowed to accept the application of a student, or admit him to lectures and recitations, before the fee has been paid and receipt endorsed upon the application-blank, except where fees are remitted. (\u00a7\u00a7 19, 20.) \u00a7 15. Fees. \u2014 Lectures and recitations are partly for fees (privation) and partly gratuitous, (public.) \u00a7 16. In the case of private lectures included in the regular courses, the fee shall not exceed one thaler (73 cents gold) for each weekly hour per semester. The fee for a course of lectures occupying fiAe hours of each week through the half-year, for instance, would be five thalers. Fees for instruction in drawing and practice in the laboratory are sub ject to special arrangements. \u00a7 17. The fees for extraordinary- lectures are fixed by the instructors in accordance with the curatorium. The rule adopted for ordinary lec tures is in general, hoAvever, not to be exceeded. \u00a7 18. The fees paid in for extraordinary* instruction r.re receiAed by the respective instructors from the treasury at the end of the semester. \u00a7 19. Remissions. \u2014 In cases of personal indigence, attested by the proper authorities, the minister of commerce, trade, and public works may, on the application of the director, remit to native students half the fees for ordinary instruction. There is no remission of the fees for special courses of lectures. \u00a7 20. The remission is endorsed by the director on the application - blank ; and the student binds himself thereupon, iu writing, to refund to the treasury of the academy the amount so remitted within six years after leaving the institution. \u00a7 21. Refunding of fees. \u2014 Fees are refunded to students when the lec tures do not take place, or are broken off during the first half of the semester, or are held at different times from those first announced. The amount so refunded must be drawn from the treasury during* the first four months of the current semester, otherwise the claim is void. \u00a7 22. Certificates. \u2014 Remarks as to the degree of industry and profi ciency manifested by the student are entered at the close of each semester in the proper columns of the application-blank. At the request of the students the director will issue, upon surrender of the application blank, a certificate as to his conduct and progress Avhile iu attendance at the academy. Students who have attended the academy for at least two semesters may be subjected to an examination and receive certificates of their"], [260, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 248 attainments. With reference to this point thc following rules are estab lished : REGULATIONS FOR THE EXAMINATIONS OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF MINES AT BERLIN. \u00a7 1. The students of the Boyal Academy of Mines may, upon leaving the same, for the purpose of obtaining proofs of their acquirements, undergo an examination, the result of which will be embodied iu an offi cial certificate, made out for them. \u00a7 2. Only those students can apply for such an examination who have attended the lectures or taken part in the practical exercises of the acad emy for at least two semesters. Nothing more is necessary for admis sion to examination than proof of such attendance. \u00a7 3. The examination may cover all the sciences and accomplishments taught at the academy. The candidates have to name those branches in which they desire to be examined. \u00a7 4. The commission conducting the examination consists of at least three members, including the director of the academy as president, an the instructors in those branches covered by the examination. \u00a7 5. The examination is both written and oral. The candidate must present, upon a subject named by the commission, a written thesis, for the preparation of which a period of six weeks is allowed him. If he is to be examined in several branches, he may choose the one to which the subject of the thesis shall belong. The candidate is also at liberty, however, to present, besides this one obligatory work, other written pro ductions or drawings. All work so presented is to be accompanied Avith the written assurance that it has been performed without assistance ; and the thesis must be in the candidate's own handwriting. \u00a7 6. Applications for examination must be addressed in writing to the director of the academy at least six weeks before the close of the sem ester, and accompanied Avith the necessary proof of twa semesters' attendance. The examining commission theu determines the subject for the thesis, so that this may be prepared during the vacation. The completed work is to be handed in to the commission within the six Aveeks before mentioned, a discretionary prolongation of which period is only to be made by the commission in cases of extraordinary hindrance. The oral examination takes place at the beginning of the following semester. \u00a7 7. The examining commission prepares a diploma or certificate con cerning the result of the oral examination aud the examination of the written thesis. These degrees of proficiency- are recognized and entered on diplomas with the words,\" mit Auszeichnung,'\" (with distinction,) ugut,'\" (well,) and ugeniigend,v (pretty well, or sufficiently.) Each examiner pro poses the verdict in his own department, and the question is determined Avhicli grade of proficiency shall be certified byr the vote of a majority of the commission. For those branches in which the candidate has not borne examination eA-en \" sufficiently\" well, no entry Avhatever is made. \u00a7 8. The candidate is free to apply after the lapse of half a year, to be re-examined in those branches iu whicii he failed ou the first trial; but after a second failure no further application will be granted. \u00a7 9. The examination fee, payable to the academical treasury when the application is made, is 10 thalers for an examination covering not more than four branches. For every additional branch an additional fee of three thalers is required ; but the whole fee can in no case exceed 20 thalers."], [261, "RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. 249 The following are the regular courses of lectures for the winter sem ester of 1868-'69 : Lectures and instructors.

Since the annexation of the kingdom of HanoAer to Prussia, the old and famous academy at Clausthal, in the Hartz mountains, has been, so to speak, dismantled. Some of the best professors have been ealled to Berlin; the former director (the celebrated mineralogist, Boemer) is dead ; and little that is important remains of the school except its excel lent courses of practice in mining and metallurgy. These are retained, because the location of Clausthal, in the midst of an ancient and still actiA-ely worked mining region, renders it peculiarly suitable for such practical instruction as cannot be imparted at the Berlin school. Prussia maintains, therefore, at Berlin a school of theory, and at Clausthal a school of practice. The method pursued at the latter place Avill appear from the following description : The object of the practical course is to impart to the student a com plete insight into all particulars and details of every branch of mining and smelting. This is effected \u2014 1. By examination of all interesting mines, dressing and smelting works of the Upper Hartz. 2. By inspection of all the apparatus and machinery used. 3. By study of different processes in actual operation and of their proper manipulations. 4. By actual experience in every department as a workman. The course begins in the first week after Easter, and lasts six months, of which two are devoted to mining, two to metallurgy, and two to the study of dressing- works and processes, including hydraulic engineering."], [262, "250 RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS TO MINING. In all these departments, complete theoretical instruction is given at the academy in Clausthal. The practical course in each department is placed under the supervision of a mining official of high degree, as teacher, who assigns the pupils, in squads of two or three, to subordinate officials, connected with the administration of mines and furnaces in operation. Under the guidance of his special instructor the student enters the mines eA-ery morning, (Saturday and Sunday excepted,) and is made to take note' of eA-erythiug in their operations. Beginning with the simplest manipulations and proceeding to the most intricate and difficult, all is explained to him. The peculiarities of special cases before him, difficul ties and the means by which they are overcome, the improvements which progress in the art of mining has effected, are all illustrated by actual examples, such as can only be furnished in mines of great antiquity, and among a population to whom this profession has been for centuries hereditary. In this manner about six Aveeks are spent in one or two mines, each of which is a labyrinth of shafts, drifts, and stopes, and an epitome itself of the history as Avell as the science of mining. The student having during this period obtained a general knowledge of the subject, and, by manual labor, acquired a certain necessary familiarity Avith details, he spends the next fortnight under the same guidance in excursions to the important copper, lead, iron and zinc mines of the Upper Hartz. The courses in dressing ores, hydraulic engineering, and metallurgy, are similarly conducted. In the latter the student takes part, with the assistance of the friendly Avorkmen, in the whole course of the metallur gical processes, and finally produces, with his own hands, the pure siher bar from the ore. Copper, iron, zinc, and lead furnaces, sulphuric acid, alum and copperas works, and the art of the assayer, are all made sub jects of attention, and that familiarity with their practical operations is acquired which doubles the value of subsequent theoretical study. Saturdays are giAen to the sketching of machinery, and to explana tions by- the instructor of those points not fully made clear during the week. The Clausthal administration has earned the gratitude of all by its liberality in this arrangement. We say gratitude, for the sacrifice of time and valuable labor im-olved in such a system has been incurred only for the good of science. Of this no one wdl entertain a doubt when we state that the fees paid by the student for this six months' practical course amount to $13 in American gold. APPENDIX.

The coinage of the United States branch mint for the month of De cember has been $2,310,000 gold and $82,000 silver; together, $2,122,000. The coinage for the year, monthly, as compared with the year 1867, has been as fodows : In the first months of the year, when freights were low to the east ward, and the supply of coin abundant, the disposition was to ship bullion. In the latter months of the year coin became scarce and eastern credits full. The mint, therefore, absorbed the larger proportion of the supply, and the operations have been immense. Every 60 days an amount has been turned out equal to the whole projected capacity of the mint for a year when it was built. In the last two months there has been silver coinage from deposits of White Pine bidlion. The total sup ply of bullion reported has been, for the last three years : The decline in the supply of bullion is due to the falling off in the product of the Washoe mines. In the last quarter of the year, how ever, the White Pine region has become very productive. The leading Steamers east. China, &c. Total.

The exports of bullion have been less than last year, thc falling off having been greatest in the last six months of the year. The silver bars have been rather less abundant, and the gold has gone rather to the mint than abroad. In the first part of the year the low freights caused the shipments to be considerable, leading, with other operating causes, to a scarcity of coin in the autumn. The opposition steamers being then withdrawn, freights advanced and the bullion was turned into the miut. This movement is seen in the following table, showing the montldy de posits of gold at the mint, the monthly exports, and the range for bars: Thus, for the whole year, about half the gold bullion was sent to the mint, a good deal of it extracted from the silver refined for the China market by the San Francisco Eefinery Company, and the other half ex ported. Of the deposits at the mint the San Francisco Assaying and Refining Company made $9,400,000 of gold, and $225,000 of silver ; together, $0,625,000\u2014 or more than half the whole. In the first six months only $3,928,000 was sent to the mint, and $11,431,676 was ex ported; in the last six months, $12,632,000 went to the mint, and $6,133,356 only was exported\u2014 reversing the operation.
