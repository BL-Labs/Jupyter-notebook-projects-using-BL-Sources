Many honest people did think, that in paying it, they consented to all the black and foul things committed by the soldiers, and their re fusal became new matter of sore persecution. A party of soldiers was brought upon the refusers by the uplifter of it, and they quartered, till ten times the value of the cess was taken ; and after all, oftimes the poor man's friends behoved to compound with the publican for a sum, a great deal more than the cess came to, besides the loss of quartering. Thus, in the parish of Carsphairn, seven cows were taken away from a poor man, upon his refusal, after quartering, to pay the cess, and all the sum owing was not five pounds Scots.

The pain was inexpressible, and his cries were heard at a great distance.\" \" They catched a young herd boy in the same parish, and would have him to discover where his Master was, whom they alleged to have been at Bothwell. The boy very probably could tell them no thing about his Master. However, they took him and fastened two small cords to his thumbs, and by these hung him up to the balk (roof) of the house. The torment he endured was very great, yet they got nothing out of him. But the other youth last spoken of, died within a little after he came out of their hands. A vast more of their cruelties might easily be added, in Ayrshire, Galloway, Dumfries, and Nithsdale, but I have only selected one or two of the different kinds of severities from a great many instances in my hands ; and ihere are instances in other shires as well as these. \" \" Francis Park in Croftfoot, in the parish of Carmonock in Lanarkshire, was, some little time after Bothwell, questioned for lend ing his plough to a neighbour of his, who was said by the soldiers to have been at Bothwell, to plough one acre of land. \" When he could not deny the matter of fact, that he lent his"], [167, "155 NOTES plough to such a man, straightway fourteen soldiers were quartered on him for some days ; they took up an inventory of all his goods and plenishing, (furniture) ; the poor man was forced to compound, and give the soldiers \u00a350, to save his house from being plundered. George Park in Muirside, in the same parish, was forced to pay 200 merks, for no other cause but his harbouring his own son, for a little in his house, after he had been at Bothwell. They likewise seized Anna Park, a singularly religious and sensible country-woman, and pressed her to tell where her husband was. The good woman peremptorily refusing, they bound her, and put kindled matches be tween her fingers, to extort a discovery from her. Her torment was great, but her God strengthened her, and she endured for a few hours all they could do, with admirable patience, and both her hands were disabled for some time. When they found they could not prevail, they spoiled the house, and abused every thing in it ; the milk they could not drink was poured out on the ground ; the groats she had for the sustenance of her family, they gave to their horses ; and the meal in chests which they could not consume, was cast out to the dunghill. \"\u2014 Woodbow, lib. 3, pp. 76, 77. i Having, in the 3d Stanza, hinted at the rapacity of the Nobles of that period, it may not be amiss, for the sake of illustration, to tran scribe the following passage."], [168, "156 NOTES. \" The Revenues of Scotland were engrossed and wasted by Lau- derdale and his friends.
