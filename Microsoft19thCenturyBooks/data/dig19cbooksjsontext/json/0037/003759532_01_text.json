Gerhard Vaudubon was a peculiar man. He was a Swiss, the son of a Swiss, who, when the boy was little more than fifteen, had settled in this country, and, in the face of many difficulties, by dint of perseverance, parsimony, and obsequiousness, had con trived, not only to establish a solid business, but to amass a con siderable sum of money, to both of which Gerhard had succeeded by natural inheritance, when he was within the shade of his fortieth year. Then, and not until then, did he take a wife, and then not so much for a wife as a housekeeper. Servants scoffed at the meagre fare he prescribed for them as well as for himself, so he cast his eyes on a fair, but portionless girl, whose father had died in his debt. This circumstance, and her utter friendlessness, were both artfully employed to wring from her a reluctant con sent, and one who had been born to better fortune passed as mistress into that dreary house in Northampton-square, Clerken well, which was marked out by a large brass plate, inscribed, \" Gerhard Vaudubon, Watchmaker.\" This calculating watchmaker had chosen well for himself ; ill for the Christian gentlewoman brought into contact with his worldliness and parsimony. His cry was ever of pressing creditors and losses in business, necessitating frugality and retrenchment \u2014 frugality and re trenchment, that is, until a marvellous watch he was inventing was completed ; a model watch that was to bring a fortune to the inventor. Schooled in adversity, and lacking firmness to resist, her care was ever to bring her moderate wants down to his narrow and narrowing requirements ; and he requited her patient endurance with fresh exactions. Fitted for something better than a menial without a menial's pay, without sympathy, without society, B"], [14, "2 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. without even the dumb companionship of books, scantily clad, imperfectly nourished, she pined, drooped, and though her first born infant lived, the second died, and the third \u2014 and she with it \u2014 all victims of a miser's greed. Brooding over an atom of fire in the neglected parlour which Mrs. Vaudubon had kept so neat and orderly without a servant, he mourned her loss after a manner peculiar to himself \u2014 that is, mourned for the comfort, the order, the cleanliness, the care ful management that had gone with his wife, mourned for the patient listener to his calculations and his complaints. In an upstairs room his little daughter Emily, forgotten by him, clung tenaciously to the undertaker's skirts, and \u2014 unacquainted with death or its grim concomitants \u2014 cried piteously in childish agony\u2014 \" Oh ! do not, do not shut my mamma up in that long box ; she will wake soon, and then how can she get out ? \" \" I must close the coffin, my poor little dear. Your mother is dead \u2014 she will never wake again,\" was all the man, in dolorously perplexed tones, could say. \" She will \u2014 I know she will \u2014 and baby too. She never slept so long before. Mamma, do get up \u2014 get up ! \" \"Marm, will you please to take this little one away and com fort her, somehow. She don't seem to understand things rightly. There was no need to appeal to the motherly woman who entered as he spoke, drawn thither by Emily's cries. With a word or two of homely sympathy, which went straight to the child's heart, she loosened the persistent clasp of the small fingers, gathered the slight form in her arms, permitted a last kiss of cold lips which could not kiss again, laid the fair head on her broad shoulder, and bore the weeping orphan away. Not, ho-wever, to her father's side. Mrs. Avery instinctively knew better than that. True, she was only Gerhard Vaudubon's lodger, between whose family and his there had been no inter course until the universal leveller entered, and broke down all harriers of prejudice or policy. But she had been summoned hastily to the bedside of his expiring wife, and had overheard the surgeon's words to the widower when all was over. \" Mr. Vaudubon, this is your doing. I warned you when the last infant died what would be the consequence of insufficient nourishment to the mother. Mrs. Vaudubon had no strength left to meet the demands of nature. It is a case of semi-starvation You are morally answerable for the deaths of both mother and son. I feel that I should be almost justified in bringing the case before a magistrate.\""], [15, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 3 She had heard, too, Vaudubon's faltered excuse that the deceased had \"never complained,\" they \"had all fared alike,\" together with the doctor's indignant response, \"Never complained ! Then the greater fool she, and the greater scoundrel you ! See you don't starve the child she has left behind ! \" Bearing this conversation in mind, and judging the doctor's accuracy by many trivial circumstances, Mrs. Avery not only \u25a0doubted the depth of the widower's sorrow, but his sympathy with the grief of his child, and so carried the real mourner to her \u2022own room. \" Here, Ted,\" said she to her son, a well-grown boy of eleven. \u25a0\" I have brought you a companion. She is in great trouble, poor thing ; you must do your best to amuse her. I am wanted downstairs.\" So saying she left the two together, first, however, putting a good slice of currant cake into the weeping child's passive hand. The boy, albeit unused to girls, and shy at first, compassionated the poor little motherless thing whose fair hair contrasted so sadly with her black dress, and whose tears moistened the very cake as she ate it. Silently he brought his treasures \u2014 ninepins, white mice, and guinea-pigs \u2014 in succession before her. It was not in childhood to resist novelties so rare ; but her curiosity was soon exhausted, and she turned abstractedly away. \" Comfort \" was not there. The ice was, however, broken. Emily ventured to put a question or two to her young companion respecting the mystery downstairs. Death had made blanks in the Avery household, and what the boy knew of death and burial, as he had seen them, he imparted, not learnedly mayhap, but with an adaptation to the inquirer's comprehension no older person could have mastered ; and raising in the little mind an anxious desire to know more of that wonder- ful Heaven to which he told her that her good mother had gone, and where she would follow in time if she were as good, and loved God. Meanwhile the meagre funeral went its way. The doctor had decidedly refused to attend, so that, besides the widower, mourners there were none but his foreman, Robert Jekyl, and his lodger, Mr. Avery ; and they could not be much more seriously affected than by the abstract suggestiveness of mortality in the close proximity of the coffined dead. Even here Gerhard's pinching fingers might be felt. Hearse and mourning-coach had been economically compressed into one vehicle. The dead and the living travelled side by side."], [16, "4 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. It was less a solemn than a sombre funeral. There was a heavy fog, through which the houses and trees on the route loomed like ghostly shadows. Jekyl and Mr. Avery shivered once or twice, and whispered something about \" cold \" and th& \"rawness of the atmosphere,\" but otherwise there was silence. The doctor was absent, but Vaudubon's conscience filled the vacant seat \u2014 filled it with his wife and sons. Remorse was busy, the remorse of defeated calculation. He had craved a son, and two had been vouchsafed \u2014 could it be that he had nipped the undeveloped buds with the frost of untimely frugality ! (You see his conscience did not smite very painfully, since he still called penuriousness \u2014 \"frugality.\") His thrifty wife had saved him so much per annum in housekeeping alone. He feared he had insisted too stringently on retrenchment \u2014 had lost, not saved \u2014 and he ground his teeth as he thought of his folly, and groaned as he contemplated future levies on his purse for wages and waste, and then the meek face of his dead wife reproached him for his sordid reckoning, with her yet unburied body so close beside him. No ! Gerhard Vaudubon did not occupy the coach- seat alone. Remorse shaped the fog into tangibility, sat by his side, kept pace with him to the open grave, moistened his handkerchief, wrung forth sobs as the mould rattled on the coffin-plate, and, clutching his arm, held him fast even to his own hearth ; where, coiled on the rug before the fire which Mrs. Avery had presumed to replenish in his absence, lay in sobbing sleep another reminder of his loss. He had parted from his companions at the door, without any pretence of hospitality, and now sat down to cogitate, thrusting his lean fingers through his black hair, and resting both elbows on his knees. \u2022 His gaze was fixed on the unconscious child, whose face, smeared alike with tears and dye from her common black frock, was half buried in a mass of tangled flaxen curls, all too like her dead mother's. Listen to the thoughts which, as he sat there, hammered at his heart, yet found no egress through the closed portcullis that kept his tongue in check. \" So, it is all over \u2014 nothing remains of my married life but an encumbrance \u2014 a qirl \u2014 helpless, useless ! And to think \u2014 two sons and both dead dead, while the girl lives \u2014 lives to mock me with my frustrated plans. And Spencer dared to say, / killed them ; starved wife and babes to death. What should I know of woman's wants and needs ? Wine and dainties forsooth ! / take no wine it is heating, and too dear \u2014 and so much butcher's meat is bad"], [17, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 5 for digestion. Yet, oh, I would have given wine or anything to have saved my boy \u2014 a boy to hand my name and invention down to future generations ! What will my paragon of a watch be to a girl ? \u2014 there seems a curse upon me \u2014 always something wrong in the moment of success ; and now a second boy gone ! stay ! may not a girl be made useful in time ? Ah ! the old Syndic Vaudubon has a son \u2014 the last of the patrician race \u2014 who knows \u2014 purse may weigh down pride \u2014 may pay for a noble marriage contract \u2014 we will see \u2014 we will see. She is very pretty! Poor thing ! She looks tired,\" and he bent over her as she lay there upon the faded rug. At last the watchmaker's heart had softened towards his child ; his feelings warmed as he meditated future possibilities ; and when, at length, Emily unclosed her eyes, crying, \" Mamma ! Mamma !\" he opened his arms and his shrivelled heart, and took her to their shelter. A cold shelter it would have proved had not the dingy house in Northampton-square held other inmates. Hitherto Mrs. Avery's notice of the child had been restricted to a passing salutation, or a pat on the fair curls, as they met in the hall or on the staircase. She was but a homely woman, the wife of a Birmingham watch -engraver who had migrated to London, with no more education than sufficed for a common-place life amongst common-place people. What culture might have made of her it is useles to speculate ; but she was brimful of womanly feeling ; her motherly instincts had been roused into action by the peculiar orphanage of Emily, and now that Vaudu bon himself had invited her neighbourly intervention, she gave those sympathies full play, and, unsought, rendered many kindly offices for the sake of the desolate child. Vaudubon thanked her for such voluntary service ; thanks \u2022cost only breath, and that he could spare. The Vaudubons were a long-lived race \u2014 he had full forty years' breath in him, or he thought so. Voluntarily, this kind friend took charge of Emily until the widower was provided with a housekeeper, and by a little clever diplomacy diverted his choice from a vinegarish spinster to a cheerful widow, whose sympathies with childhood had not been frozen at the fountain, and whose sense of duty had a higher source than self-interest. Then before Dr. Spencer's stern admonition had lost its force, his lodger struck a still vibrating \u00abhord, and by an apparently casual observation that \" growing girls required good food and plenty of it,\" obtained for the child a more generous dietary than would have fallen to her lot, or"], [18, "6 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. been accorded to the mere request of his new housekeeper, Mrs, Johnson, though she did quiet battle with his parsimony. A little later, with equal tact, Mrs. Avery took advantage of the watchmaker's temporary remorseful liberality to suggest that \" schooling \" was a necessity ; but the suggestion fell on deaf ears, or was answered with, \" Time enough for that, quite time enough.\" Board schools to educate one man's children at the cost of another had not been thought of then. No one had thought of picking A's pocket to save the better-filled pocket of B. the cost of \" all the arts and ologies\" for his youngsters. No, the impatient system for contaminating the purer minds of respectably and decently conducted children by contact with the gutter Arab \u2014 before Lord Shaftesbury's wiser scheme had done all its work had not dawned ; or Gerhard Vaudubon would have been sure,. like others, to save his purse at the cost of his child. And it might have been \"time enough\" for ever, had not Gerhard Vaudubon been haunted by nightly dreams of his dead wife bearing two puny infants in her arms, and adjuring him, as he hoped for eternal peace, to see that the girl she had left behind was better fed and cherished. And who knows that the day dreams he secretly conjured up were not more effectual than those which made his pillow painful. In either case, some months elapsed before Mrs. Avery's kindly efforts met with success. At length, on promising to find a good and inexpensive school in the vicinity, and volunteering her son's guardianship^ for Emily to and fro, Gerhard reluctantly consented. Yet if an idea of qualifying his daughter for the future he had mapped out as hers had anything to do with it, his tight lips never let the secret out \u2014 supposing he had one. Mrs. Avery had to win her way through obstacles. Master Ted was almost as difficult to manage as the watchmaker. His guardianship was easier promised than obtained. He had a will of his own had Edward Avery, and he argued the point. \"Now, look you, mother,\" said he, \"I don't care to have a girl always at my heels. I don't mind it much in the house, but then she's such a little thing \u2014 and how can a fellow play at ring-taw, or rounders, or leap-frog, with a ghl to mind ? \" Nevertheless, even he was won over by his good-hearted mother to take pity on the solitary orphan ; and, having under taken the charge, had no more notion of crying off because there' were difficulties to be encountered than she had. Hers was a practical religion, and she had trained him never to look back when he had once put his hand to the plough. It is true the"], [19, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 7 lads jeered at him, but after one or two pitched battles with young scamps who saluted him as \" Polly, our nurse ! \" ho constituted himself the child's sworn protector, and before many months had passed away Emity and he were sworn friends. A want of self-reliance had been Mrs. Vaudubon's chief characteristic, and in that, as well as in personal appearance, Emily closely resembled her mother. Her father, whom she seldom saw, except at their homely repasts, was not a man to invite a child's confidence, although, after a secret fashion of his own, all the stray tendrils of his closed heart began to twine around her. The child, however, saw nothmg of this, There was no invitation held out to her own expanding affections ; the calculating machine repelled her advances, and it was only in the benign circle of Mrs. Avery's hearth that love for God or humanity reached her. With no better home companion, there fore, than housewifely Mrs. Johnson, no wonder that she clung to Edward Avery with all a child's faith. He was the depository of all her little secrets, her counsellor in dilemmas ; he smoothed the rough road of learning ; raked up from unsuspected corners the hoarded playthings of the house hold, mutilated or perfect ; taught her to spin a top, bowl a hoop \u2014 and many like accomplishments. In short, he petted and patronised her, boy fashion ; and, moreover, played the tyrant in very orthodox boy fashion too, she obeying his orders and behests with scarcely an objection. Could either have foreseen all that was to spring from this habit of submission to habitual command, how their young hearts would have been troubled, though the friendship might not have been otherwise disturbed \u2014 human nature is so perverse. Years were more threatening than prescience ; the youth left school, and having no liking for the jeweller's bench, entered a warehouse in the city, Miss Vauduhon being at the same time old enough to go to school without a protector. Still, in Edward's absence, she took charge of his rabbits and guinea pigs, and on his return in the evenings, reported progress in all matters of mutual interest, to which he listened with about as much attention as could be expected from one at that transition age, when the youth is more than half-ashamed to own he still cares for the sports of the boy. But, when an incipient down made its appearance on Edward's upper lip, as the down became palpable and finally demanded a razor, the distance between the two perceptibly widened. There is a broad gulf between twelve and eighteen. The young man, already in favour with his employers, had other"], [20, "8 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. pursuits, other associates, and regarded his former playmate much as an elder brother regards a favourite little sister. When his rabbits and guinea-pigs were parted with, he bought a canary in a fanciful cage to console her for their loss, and she cried over the bird without well knowing why, except that she was lonely ; and so she moped and fretted for her boy friend, a boy no longer, much as an older damsel might have done, deserted by her lover. By-and-bye another change was wrought ; the awkward and ungainly girl developed into a maiden of rare beauty. The blue eyes deepened into full violet ; the abundant flaxen hair, no longer a hoydenish tangle, added a shade to its tint, just sufficient to give expression to eyebrows and eyelashes ; a delicate tinge warmed the once pale cheeks and lips, the tiny ears curved like graceful shells. She was like her mother in her palmy days ; so fair, her father felt her beauty something glorious to possess, something to brighten up the dull room when he came from the workshop at the back to his frugal meals. But of Christian graces, or beauty of soul, he knew little, and cared less. He took religion for granted, as he took air and light, and, but for Mrs. Avery and his housekeeper, she might have grown up as much a heathen as one of the ancient dwellers of the Swiss lakes. More than one rich customer (Gerhard was an importer, as well as a watchmaker), catching a glimpse of Emily, requested an introduction, and congratulated Gerhard on the possession of a daughter so lovely; whereat he bowed, smiled, intertwisted his lean fingers, and felt that his schemes for Emily, and himself were going on swimmingly. One day about this time Gerhard said, \" Make yourself as nice as you can and come with me, Emily.\" A request so unwonted caused her to look up in wonderment. \" With you, father ? Where are we going ? \" \" You will see.\" She did see, and that was all. Their walk ended at a photo grapher's where, more than ever puzzled, she obeyed instructions mechanically, the result, to her surprise, being her own portrait. On her way home she ventured to ask, \" Why have you had my likeness taken, father ? \" \"For a relative in Switzerland,\" was his curt reply; and there the matter dropped. Beyond that brief glimpse in the photographer's room, she saw no more of the sun-picture. He never encouraged questions, and she and Mrs. Johnson waited in vain for its exhibition at home ; discussing with no small wonderment the possible motive he could have had to part with his money for a mere likeness and"], [21, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 9 that for someone abroad. And so the incident deepened into a mystery. You see, Gerhard Vaudubon never relaxed the grip of his gold to adorn her beauty in befitting robes. Her garments were of common texture ; and if becomingly shaped, that cost him nothing. With Mrs. Johnson's help she fabricated her own clothes \u2014 when she could get the materials. The old man was an enigma to all around him. No hint of his ever gave a clue to his wealth, he worked late and early as though he were so necessitated ; but constantly harping on the jpoverty-string had almost worn it out (the model-watch shared the same fate for the same reason). Yet Emily, who lived poorly, and dressed poorly, gave him the fullest credence ; and so, rather than trouble him for pocket-money, which he possibly might not be able to afford, at Mrs. Johnson's suggestion, she asked her old friend upstairs how she might best earn for herself sufficient to make additions to her wardrobe unknown to him. Mrs. Avery approved her independence. Accustomed to work in her young days, she saw nothing out of course in a struggling wat hmaker's daughter doing so likewise. \" That's right, Emily,\" she said. \" One girl that can earn her living is worth two would-be fine ladies. If you can only make enough to clothe yourself respectably, your father will have one care the less, and you too. I was a pen-stamper at Gillott's factory before I married Avery. The bread of idleness is apt to turn sour.\" \"Mine has been sour for a long while,\" said Emily, \"but what can I do?\" \" You can net, can't you? \" \"Oh, yes!\" \" Well, I think I know where work is to be had, so put on your bonnet and come with me.\" And good Mrs. Avery put down her own work and \" tidied herself up,\" as she called it, \" to show her the way to go about it, business like.\" In a few days Emily was industriously plying netting-needle and mesh in the production of chenille hair-nets, for which fashion had created a demand. Soon little niceties were added to her attire, and her observant father hugged himself in the belief that she had eked out bis paltry allowance very satisfactorily! Not a woman to do things by halves, Mrs. Avery, taking Emily's beauty and inexperience into consideration, offered to share with the good housekeeper the duty of going to and from the warehouse with her protegee's work. This caused Emily to \u25a0be once more a frequent visitant upstairs. She again came in"], [22, "10 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. contact with Edward ; she a shy girl verging on seventeen, he a man of full twenty-three summers. Not now did she bound to meet him with a shout of delight, as in the old school days, when she was almost as boyish as himself, but hesitatingly, and with a maidenly reserve, which would have been sufficiently attractive had her face been cast in a plainer mould. Nor was young Avery as self-possessed as formerly. He was taken by surprise, and did not all at once recover himself. With an apology he extinguished the cigar he was smoking, on the first occasion, and somehow forgot an appointment for the evening. Thenceforward his masculine friends missed him from their midst. A reading mania seized him : he was always intent upon a book when Emily had occasion to visit his mother, and of course it was put down on her entrance. Sometimes he volunteered a loan of the volume, and not unfrequently thought it necessary to escort her downstairs, where he was apt to linger if the old man did not chance to be there. Soon Mrs. Avery was informed that close rooms were not good for the health, and that a key, giving admission to the Square's central garden called the Green, was at the disposal of herself and Miss Vaudubon. In short, within an incredibly brief space of time \u2014 almost unconsciously on Emily's part \u2014 the old relations were established between the two \u2014 with a difference. The subtle essence, known as love, had penetrated to their souls, sparkled in their eyes, kindled on their cheeks, found utterance in sighs. Ere long the lips interpreted the mute language of the heart, and the pair lived an ideal life, in which the world had no share. All the hours not actually devoted to business Edward spent by Emily's side, whether in the Green or in the house ; she with no thought of impropriety, and no knowledge of conventionalities ; he because it was his pleasure. He looked forward to make her his wife at no distant period, when a promised advance in his salary would enable him to maintain her ; nothing doubting that the niggardly old watchmaker (who seemed to care more for his mythical watch than for his blooming daughter) would gladly rid himself of an incumbrance. Of any marked disparity in their relative positions he never dreamed, any more than of opposition. Accustomed to see the two together as children, Gerhard expressed no surprise when he found Edward reading by his daughter's side now and then in an evening, whilst she plied her"], [23, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 11 needle; and but for a meddlesome woman, the wife of his fore man, matters had gone on quietly enough. But Mrs. Jekyl, with a laudable zeal for the reputation of others, threw herself in old Vaudubon's way, and with many protestations of her disinterestedness, and the purity of her motives, proceeded to enlighten him as, to certain \" goings-on as was the talk of the neighbourhood.\" \"Anybody as likes, sir, may see them a walkin' and whisperin' in the Green night after night, or sittin' in your parlour on the sofy, with their heads close together, as anyone may see as passes, by the shadder on the blind.\" The watchmaker's dark eyes expanded, his teeth set, his breath came with a rush through his nostrils, he gripped his long lean hands until the sharp nails pierced the palms ; but when the busybody had concluded her narrative, turned on his heel, and left her without a word of either thanks or rebuke. As a light to a slow match over a powder magazine was Mrs. Jekyl's unexpected revelation. Yet Vaudubon did not rush home to explode in wrath at once, but set himself in wait for confirma tion. He had not long to wait. From behind the wire blind, himself unseen, he beheld the pair strolling under the trees in the twilight, then leave the Green, and, arm-in-arm, cross the Square towards the house, to which Avery 's latch-key gave admission. Then his sharpened ears detected a rapturous kiss, and words of endearment. He rose to his feet, confronted them as they opened the parlour door, and, notwithstanding the dim light, they saw his thin lips work, and his eyes gleam like some beast of prey. Involuntarily Emily clutched her lover's arm ; the arm which as hastily drew her within its shelter as one which had a right to defend her. Before a word was spoken, she old man plucked her thence with passionate force, and whirled her across the room, where she sank into a chair in terrified silence. Then the storm burst. Invectives, abuse, accusations were huddled upon each other in inexplicable confusion. Foam stood upon the writhing lips of the distempered man, as he charged his astounded lodger with a design to rob him of his daughter. Edward was not slow to defend himself. He crossed the room to the side of the now weeping girl, again placed his arm around her shoulder, as if to reassure her, drew himself up, and whilst Vaudubon's skinny fingers twisted and writhed like knotted"], [24, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 12 snakes, and his agonised tongue refused further utterance, exclaimed \u2014 \" Rob you of your daughter ! What value have you set upon her ? How have you guarded her ? / prize her. I love her. I mean to make her my wife. I earned the right when I was a boy. I will maintain it now I am a man.\" Then stooping towards her, \" Don't cry, Emily, there must be some mistake here. Your father has been misinformed, perhaps misunder stands my motives.\" \" I am not mistaken, you impudent jackanapes ! \u2014 you insuffer able scoundrel ! \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you beggarly rascal ! I see through it all \u2014 mother, father, all in the plot to rob me. A paltry ware houseman, without a shilling, expect to mate with the daughter of one whose invention will be a fortune for any man ! Leave her side, I say ! \" Edward could scarcely forbear a smile. The \" invention \" was supposed to be a harmless craze of the old fellow's, and as such passed as a jest amongst the Clerkenwell watchmaking fraternity. Not desirous further to exasperate the infuriated father, he took no heed of his abuse, but replied as quietly as his own temper would permit \u2014 \"I see nothing in your mode of life, Mr. Vaudubon, which should place a barrier between myself and your daughter. You have always affirmed you had a difficulty to make all ends meet, and seeing that I have a progressive salary, have already laid by a sum towards furnishing a home for Emily, and am in prospect of an immediate advance, I see nothing which should render the match unequal.\" The watchmaker was caught in his own trap. He had pleaded poverty until he had impressed the fiction on others, and now he stood wavering between his desire to confound an upstart with the knowledge that Emily was an heiress, and his natural tendency to keep his riches secret. \" I daresay not,\" replied he at length, sarcastically, \"but / do ! She is not for you, young man, but for your betters. I have other views for my child. So get you gone, the whole beggarly tribe of you \u2014 I'll clear the house of the lot.\" And so he did. In another week the Averys occupied other apartments in the locality, and not until then was Emily allowed to move freely about the house ; her father's threats operating on her plastic nature as effectively as lock and key. i"], [25, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 13 PART II. MARRIAGE. The foreman and his meddling wife were at once inducted into the vacant rooms ; the former with a slight increase of salary, and a vague promise of future partnership. Jekyl, an honest, straightforward fellow, could not comprehend the motive for this sudden promotion, but Mrs. Jekyl plumed herself on her \" secret service,\" and not unreasonably concluded that future manifesta tions of like disinterested regard for her husband's employer, would be as gratefully appreciated and acknowledged. How far events justified her calculations remains to be seen. Emily, cowed by her father's violence, isolated from companions, separated from Edward, deprived of his support, sank into a state of despondence which her father mistook for submission, though had he seen her pet the canary, which was Edward's gift, he might have held another opinion. \" Mrs. Johnson, see that Emily holds no communication with that vagabond Avery, or his scheming family. I hate them ! \" Such was Gerhard Vaudubon's vindictive charge to Mrs. John son, when \u2014 yielding to that discreet matron's suggestion that the poor child was pining for fresh air, and that if illness followed there would be a doctor's bill to pay \u2014 he suffered Emily to leave the house for the first time after his enlightenment. Mrs. Johnson was no doubt a trusty and faithful servant, but she had as it were reared the girl, who had paid her back with affectionate confidence, while her miserly master had paid her services with coin only, and breath \u2014 the breath of which he had so much to spare \u2014 for empty thanks \u2014 and anathemas. True, his payment in specie was scant, but it was what she had contracted for, and she was legally bound to be content ; but she had rendered service through long years, heart service, motherly service to his child, for which no coin in his coffers could pay ; and she might not have been content, but that Emily paid her back with the coin of the heart, affection and trust. No wonder, then, if Mrs. Johnson's relatives became suddenly anxious for her well-being, or that the postman knew better than to deliver her voluminous correspondence when vigilant eyes were upon him. No wonder either that she discovered that the"], [26, "14 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. Avery's new abode lay in her direct route whatsoever shop or market she had occasion to visit. Consequently it was no marvel that Emily and Edward occasionally met. Not often certainly, for she was timid and stood in awe of her terrible father \u2014 but whenever a plausible excuse could be found for an errand outside the prescribed hours, which was but seldom. These stolen interviews were inexpressibly dear to the young couple ; whatever scruples Emily might have had being hushed by the arguments of Edward, and seconded by a powerful reasoner in her own heart. Her timid \" I dare not meet you so often, Edward, I dare not, indeed ! \" was met by \"I cannot live without you, Emily, you must come,\" and beyond his must there was no appeal. Neither Mrs. Avery nor Mrs. Johnson had any scruples about the matter ; the former averred her belief that the old man was \"cranky,\" had \"gone off his head,\" and that his wonderful invention would \" land him in Bedlam or the Union some day ; \" whilst both maintained that he was a \" mean old skinflint,\" who had starved the mother to death and did not deserve so good a daughter. And so, misled by Vaudubon himself, they felt justified to themselves in securing a better fate for the girl. About this time, to the astonishment of everybody, the wonderful watch was completed. Jekyl, alone permitted to inspect it, pronounced it a marvel of skill and ingenuity. The case had been engraved by Mr. Avery at least two years previously. The Vaudubon watch was at once provisionally registered, and letters-patent applied for. That precaution taken, the old man's habits underwent a change. A strange restlessness seized him ; he was coming and going at all hours, sometimes alone, but more frequently accompanied by gentlemen, who were invariably ushered into the presence of Emily, as if it was his intention to thrust her into notice side by side with his paragon watch. One of these, a foreigner, about eight-and-thirty years of age, repeated his visits ; and though his very imperfect English rendered his speech all but unintelligible, his manner was impressive enough, and required no interpreter. \" Edward,\" said she, during one of their brief interviews, more frequent and less guarded, now the watchmaker's many excursions from home left his womankind more at liberty, \" Edward that foreigner was at our house again to-day. He certainly is' very handsome, and very polite, but I don't altogether like his manners \""], [27, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 15 \"Neither do I,\" responded Edward, earnestly. \"From all I hear, I think he makes much too free ; and, what is worse, 1 fancy your father encourages him ! \" \" That I'm sure father does,\" she assented warmly, blushing as she spoke, \" or he would never presume to kiss my hand, and in his presence.\" The lover fired with indignation. \" Kiss your hand ? The presumptuous puppy ! I only wish \" \" Yes, and would you have thought it, Edward, this Monsieur Vaudubon \" \"Vaudubon! Vaudubon did you say, Emily?\" (he had hitherto been only that foreigner). \" Yes, and when my father was out of the room to-day \u2014 and I believe he often leaves the parlour on purpose \u2014 I must tell you, to my great surprise, that Monsieur Vaudubon took from his pocket my own photograph, and, comparing it with my face, coolly told me it was ' ver bad likeness \u2014 not booteful so moosh.\" Edward grew suddenly white, whether with rage, or jealousy, or fear, or all combined, it is not easy to determine. Instinctively he drew her closer to him, as if some one had offered to snatch her away. \" Your portrait in the hands of this stranger \u2014 this foreigner named Vaudubon ! My Emily, my darling, this can be no other than ' the relative in Switzerland ' for whom the likeness was taken.\" \" So Mrs. Johnson conjectured,\" said Emily, ruminating. \" Conjectured ! It is certainty, not conjecture. I see now what your father's ' other views ' for his daughter were ! \" added Edward, bitterly. \" Some rich relation he has lured with your beauty, and deluded with fanciful notions of a grand fortune to be made by his precious watch ! \" with a sneer, \" I think I see it ! \" he exclaimed, contemptuously. \" Fortunes are not made so readily now-a-days.\" \" Nor in any days,\" laughed Emily, \" if father is to be a criterion ; he has grown grey over making a watch, but his for-' tune seems as far off as ever.\" There was a pause, during which Edward stood cogitating. Then, with some abruptness, he asked, \" What is this Monsieur Vaububon ? Another Swiss watchmaker ? \" \" Oh, no ! Father says he is a nobleman by birth ; belongs to one of the oldest patrician families in Switzerland, and is the son of the Syndic of Lausanne.\" \" Noblemen, indeed ! as if a nobleman would condescend to marry a poor watchmaker's \""], [28, "16 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. \" Stop,\" said Emily, proudly ; \" you forgot my father himself\" belongs to the same family.\" \" At a long distance, I should say,\" thought Edward, though he would not give her pain by its expression. There was another pause. \" Emily, we must be married at once,\" said her lover, with decision. \" Married, and at once ? \" faltered she, changing colour. \" Oh,. Edward, dear, you cannot mean it.\" \" Not mean it ! My darling, but I do ! Not mean it ? Now, Emily, do you think I mean to dangle on in this way month after month, only catching a glimpse of you by stealth now and then ? Do you think I mean to wait until this fellow, who has, no doubt, a purse as long as his beard, comes and buys you from your affectionate father ? Not I ! so we must be married at once.\" \" We cannot, Edward ; I am sure my father would never consent ; we must wait until I am of age.\" \"Pshaw! Of age ! Now, my darling, do be reasonable; unless you marry me without your father's consent, he will certainly marry you without your consent, and not ask what your age may be. Now, Emily, do say ' yes ! ' \" \" I cannot, Edward ; I dare not. My father would kill me.\" He lifted her face to his and looked steadily in her eyes. \" Emily, do you truly love me ? \" \" Oh, Edward, you know I do.\" \" Then I shall put up the banns to-morrow.\" \" Oh, no ; I dare not.\" \" But I dare.\" And so they parted. Fear of her father contended with Emily's love for Edward Avery, and as Monsieur Vaudubon took his departure, she was for some time resolute in her refusal to marry clandestinely. But Edward's alarm, once raised, was not to be allayed. He grew more pertinacious as she grew more hesitating. He urged their union by letter, urged it when they met, until at length, worn out by his importunities \u2014 unable to resist his will, and, I am afraid, counselled by two matrons, who should have 'known better \u2014 she gave a trembling assent. Of all the drowsy squares in Clerkenwell, Northampton Square is the drowsiest ; the busy life of neighbouring streets only penetrates as a monotonous hum. One sultry day in June 1854 when Emily sat darning a pair of her father's well-worn hose by the parlour window, the square looked more sleepy than its"], [29, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 17 wont. The fiery sun, glaring fiercely on the hot flags and languid trees, seemed the sole thing wide awake. The very canary over her head dozed on his perch, and only brisked up occasionally when roused by a passing footstep ; then it would pour a shrill defiance to the twittering sparrows hopping idly from spray to spray in the dusty green enclosure, and as suddenly sink again to sleepy silence. Even the occupation of the watchmaker's fair-haired daughter seemed congenial to the day, since darning and celerity are incompatible ; but there was a listlessness and languor about tho girl not altogether warranted, either by her occupation or the state of the atmosphere. Occasionally she dropped needle and stocking both on her lap, and sighing, gazed out into the square or across the dingy room, seeing nothing, and no one but tho pictures in her own mind. The slightest noise in the passage, or the rooms beyond, suggestive of intrusion, recalled her to herself and caused a hasty resumption of her work ; but as each sound subsided so did her fitful industry, and she lapsed into reverie once more. She had taken an injudicious, nay, an imprudent step, and was pondering the probable consequences, with a sickness of heart fully justified by her anomalous position. In the seldom-opened books of a retired Islington church reposed the two signatures of Edward Avery and Emily Vaudubon : suspended from her neck by a narrow ribbon, a plain gold ring lay in concealment ; and in the workshop at the back of the house, engrossed in matters pertaining to the patent of his model watch, sat a father unconscious that his daughter had a secret. Fathers cast in ordinary moulds do not regard with too much favour such a dereliction from duty ; what, then, would be its effect upon so peculiar a man as this Clerkenwell watchmaker ? They had been married about five weeks when Emily thus sat darning her father's hose at the open window ; ruminating between the tardy stitches on the possible consequences of her rash act, and the best method of breaking the news to him. Every hour since her marriage the weight of her disobedience had grown more oppressive ; she feared to meet her father's eye lest he should read her secret in her face ; and, left to herself, she was not of a nature to gloze over the fact that she had done wrong. To make matters worse, Edward was no longer at hand to sustain her drooping spirits by occasional words of hope and good cheer. Messrs. Mulberry, Leefe, and Co., at a moment's notice, had despatched him into Scotland, to supply the c"], [30, "18 THE WATCHMAKERS' DAUGHTER. place of a traveller taken suddenly ill on the road : a mark of his employers' confidence which somehow Emily did not rightly appreciate, Her natural timidity increased in his absence, every trembling leaf communicated its tremor to her heart ; she was filled with strange forebodings, which no rhetoric of Mrs. Johnson's could dissipate. The fact is, she had observed that Mrs. Jekyl, from whom she held aloof with an instinctive perception that the woman was treacherous, had latterly thrust herself forward at all hours, intruding into her presence on the most flimsy pretexts. Besides which, she had stared at Emily with a bold effrontery which made the blood rise in conscious flushes over her neck and brow. The young wife had grown afraid of Mrs. Jekyl, and with good reason, although she knew it not. She had passed the window as Emilj* sat there, nodding with a familiarity which had a strange meaning in it ; and that in part caused the fitful reverie in which I have pourtrayed her, when even the pet canary was forgotten. That evening Gerhard Vaudubon burst in upon his daughter with the fury she so well remembered, upbraided her with treachery, accused Edward Avery of being a fortune-hunter, a time-server, marrying her only for the money she was likely to inherit. Overmastered by his passion, he divulged the secret of his accumulated hoards, and swore with many an imprecation that no penny of his money should pass into the hands of an Avery. \" I'll be the death of him ! He shall rue it!\" was every now and then his vehement ejaculation, whilst Emily, more dead than alive, sank in a swoon at his feet. Mrs. Johnson, hearing the commotion, hastened to the assis tance of her young mistress only to be in turn assailed as a \" go between,\" \" a conspirator.\" Finally, the angry man took his housekeeper by the shoulders, and hurried her into the square. With the help of Mrs. Jekyl, he tumbled her boxes and belong ings after her, together with a month's wages in advance. She was dismissed \u2014 and Emily without a friend. She had let go her hold of that invisible Friend who has power to save in the hour of extremest peril, when she weakly yielded to her lover's entreaties, and now she was drifting rudderless to sea, helpless and almost hopeless. When Edward Avery, three weeks later, obeying a sudden summons from home, rushed up distractedly to town by express train, leaving his journey incomplete, father and daughter had"], [31, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 19 \u25a0disappeared, and on the door shone an additional brass plate ; the revised inscription being \" Jekyl, late Gerhard Vaudubon, Watchmaker.\" PART III. BLIGHTED HOPES. Not much more communicative than the brass plate on the door was either Jekyl or his wife, although the latter looked wondrously important and intelligent (a human hydrostatic pump at high pressure) when Edward Avery thundered at the knocker in Northampton Square and first demanded, then implored, some tidings of the bride so mysteriously spirited off. It was in vain to ply the high pressure engine ; the well was dry, and all that she brought from the depths was a dis closure of her own discreditable share in the transaction, for which her husband took her pretty sharply to task, even before the inquirer's face. \" Believe me, Mr. Edward, I knew nothing of this until now,\" said he. \" I should have been ashamed to owe my prosperity to the ruin of others, brought about by my own wife's meddling. I should indeed ! \" \" If this be true, Mr. Jekyl, then you surely will not refuse a \u25a0clue, however slight, by which I can trace and recover my wife ? \" \"Indeed, but I must ! I am tied down, hand and foot. I am downright sorry for you both, now I know the rights of the case. I had no notion you two were married. But now you see, business is business, and this concern only became mine on the \u25a0condition that I preserved the secret of the old fellow's where abouts.\" \"A strange condition,\" remarked Edward, dubiously. \" So it is, but if you doubt me I can show the transfer deed.\" Jekyl produced the parchment, looking anything but proud of advantages so questionably obtained. Edward wrung his hands in utter despair. \" What,\" he exclaimed, in tones of acute anguish, \" what can he that terrible man's motive in hiding my darling from me ? What malevolent design is he carrying out ? What cruelty practising against his helpless child ! Oh, that I had but taken her to my own home at once ! If homely, comfort at least is"], [32, "20 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. there, comfort such as Emily has never known ; she would there have had protectors in my absence.\" Mrs. Jekyl had sneaked out of the room a little less triumphant than on her entrance. Jekyl, thoroughly abashed, attempted some extenuation of his own conduct, whilst Edward, with his hand to his head, sat swaying in unutterable pain. \" You see, sir,\" said the apologist, \" I had worked with the Vaudubons, father and son, nigh upon thirty year, for they never turned a good workman away if they could help it ; and though I dare say I might have got better wages in another place, I knew their ways and kept looking for a rise. Well, I got one when the old chap hooked it, and I was made foreman. Then I got another when we came to live here ; but when Gerhard Vaudubon offered to turn the business over to me, I was fair stunned. At first I thought he was joking, but then he never did joke, and when I found he was in earnest I was only too glad to take his offer on his own terms. They seemed very liberal too, for him ; but he had a longer head than I, and I find will have a heavy pull at the profits for many a long year to come.\" Edward caught at this. \" Then you will have to transact business together from time to time \u2014 will have to meet him some where ? \" \" Ye-ye-es, certainly,\" answered the other, hesitatingly. \" Can you not write to him, convey a letter or message from me to him, to my poor dear Emily ? \" \"Well, there is nothmg to hinder my seeding a line en closed in my next, and I'll tell you what I'll do \u2014 if the old chap doesn't come round before then \u2014 when I pay my first instalment I'll do my best to see the poor thing, and give her a chance of letting you know what he's up to. If I wasn't under oath, I'd be tempted to split even now.\" No more satisfactory answer could the bereaved husband obtain. As he rose to depart, Emily's canary gave a faint chirp of recognition. \" Mr. Jekyl,\" asked he, \"will you part with that bird ? It was my gift to Emily in our happier days ; it was her pet.\" \"Oh, take it and welcome. My missus hasn't much liking for birds ; and if I didn't now and then give a look at it, Miss Emily's fine piper would die of neglect. Besides, it has seemed to mope ever since the young lady was carried off.\" Edward thanked him, and took off the canary, to be henceforth petted as if it had been a legacy from the dead, as well by kind Mrs. Avery as by himself. Not being possessed of superfluous means, in spite of his-"], [33, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 21 distress, inexorable business called the young traveller back to his deserted post, the firm of Mulberry, Leefe, and Co., \" over looking his first neglect of duty, in consideration of the peculiar circumstances ; \" but he went like a man walking in his sleep, or barely awakened from some terrible dream. He exhausted his savings in ineffectual enquiries. A carriage with luggage had been seen to drive from Vaudubon's door after dusk, but even a detective failed to discover vehicle or driver. He consulted a solicitor, and learned that the law gave him undoubted possession of his wife when he could find and claim her. In all the towns he visited on business he left full descriptions of father and daughter with the police ; but months rolled on, bringing no tidings, no hope, no answers to the pathetic appeals Jekyl good-naturedly transmitted for him only to be rebuffed for his interference. Where was Emily all this time ? After the fierce outburst of his wrath \u2014 consequent on Mrs. Jekyl's second revelation \u2014 had subsided, Gerhard Vaudubon, to all appearance, relapsed into his ordinary mood. Mrs. Jekyl was, however, under instructions not to lose sight of his disobedient daughter for one instant, a rich silk dress being the price of her amateur wardership. To her little mind this delegated authority was an honourable trust, and she was duly vigilant. Besides, she owed the girl a grudge for want of sociality, and thus stimulated by petty spleen, effectually precluded all possibility of communication between the newly-made wife and her distant husband. Emily herself felt the restraint less a hardship than she would have done had Edward been in town ; and as her father had resumed his old manner towards her \u2014 nay, was kinder than ordinary \u2014 she trusted the restriction was but temporary, and that when her dear husband returned all would be smoothed over. She wrote a letter to the new traveller, stating that their marriage was discovered, but forbore to annoy him with details, lest his anxiety should interfere with that efficient management of business on which his future advancement depended. Then she returned to her netting, petting her canary between whiles, and patiently waiting the answer which never came. The bribed milk-boy, for a higher fee, surrendered his trust to the warder, and she to her master. One evening \u2014 the twenty -fifth of June, as she remembered throughout her memorable life \u2014 Emily was blandly invited to take a walk with Mrs. Jekyl, and cautioned to wrap herself up well, because after the heat of the day the wind was chilly."], [34, "22 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. Desirous to conciliate, she consented, with no suspicion of treachery. It was dark when they returned. A brougham (hired from a distant livery stable) was at the door ; it was laden with luggage, which she little thought contained her own wardrobe, packed in her absence. Her father stood with the open door of the carriage in his hand. Without warning, she was hurried forward, in another moment was shut in the brougham with her father, and on her way to the Tower Stairs and the Dunkirk boat. The rapidity and suddenness with which all this was done paralyzed her faculties, and rendered her incapable of resistance, even had time for a thought of resistance been allowed her. Before she had well recovered from her surprise, her father spoke, in low taunting tones, audible above all the noise of the streets and the rattle of the carriage-wheels. \" Mrs. Edward Avery, I salute you by the fictitious title for the first time and the last. You lay down your temporary wifedom to-night, \u2014 you resume your maiden name \u2014 you have no claim on any otht-r \u2014 no claim, do you hear ? I hold landed property in France and Switzerland ; born in the latter, I am a subject of the former. The Code Napoleon holds no mprriage legal contracted by son or daughter under age without the parents' consent. I go to annul your marriage. The beggar who calls you his wife has seen you for the last time ! Remember, you were warned : your disobedience brings its own punishment.\" Emily shuddered, and moaned, \" 0, father, you cannot be so cruel ! \" \"Cruel ! It was he, the stripling, who stole you like a thief, who was cruel. The infamous scoundrel ! \u2014 to tell me I did not value \u2014 did not love you. Listen, girl ! When my wife died I gave you all the love that had been hers \u2014 and more \u2014 more. I have spent years toiling for you \u2014 you.\" (It was false ; he had been a miser from his boyhood.) \" And now, how do you requite me ? _ Fall in love, forsooth, and marry a man without a shilling ; even in the face of my prohibition. The knave counted on my money-bags too soon. I will disappoint him. Think you I will throw away my hard-earned gold on a beggar? My father's ghost would rise, if I did.\" Emily sobbed out, \" We never knew you were rich \u2014 we thought you were poor and overworked ; else why did I earn my own pocket-money ? \" \" It is a lie, Emily ; your allowance was ample. Mark me I In my native land there is a Vaudubon, not over rich, but noble. I mean you to mate with him. The Vaudubon in his chateau"], [35, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 23 might despise the daughter of a poor Clerkenwell watchmaker, however fair ; so I added to my hoards daily ; laboured to perfect my wondrous watch. At last I succeeded, and the wealthy child of Vaudubon the inventor was fit to mate with Vaudubon the patrician ; for patrician he is by birth in spite of the Republic ! \" \" How could I marry a man I never saw, who never saw me ? \" remonstrated she in techy gasps. \" All this is new to me.\" \" But not to us. Nor should it be to you. He had your portrait two years back ; and it is three months since he was last iu London, as you must know. His admiration was quite plain enough, if his English was not.\" \"Oh ! I remember now ;\" and she shuddered at the recollection. \" Oh, you do ; well, I then promised you to him with a fan do wer.\" Emily ejaculated, \" Without my consent or knowledge ! \" \"Tush ! Who asks a child's consent? Did you consult me? I willed it ; that was sufficient ; the nuptials were but deferred until this was finished.\" Gerhard drew forth the watch and gazed upon it tenderly. \" It was finished \u2014 my ambition neared fulfilment \u2014 and you \u2014 you dashed my hopes down without a word \u2014 without a thought of the father who was planning to perpetuate his name and make you great.\" \" Oh, forgive us, father. You were so angry, and we loved each other so long \u2014 and we were afraid,\" she sobbed out. \"Afraid!\" interrupted he with a sneer, \"aye, and thought to defeat me by a secret marriage ! Defeat \u2014 defeat me \u2014 a man who spent twenty years in the construction of a watch ! Such men are never defeated. I will spend twenty more years, if need be, to put this idiotic marriage aside.\" \" Oh, father, father, you cannot be so crue ! \" The coach stopped. \" Dare by word or sign to attempt resistance to my lawfid authority, and take the consequences. No one will presume to interfere between a father and child \u2014 but I know how to punish contumacy.\" Had he read the thought floating through the girl's mind of an appeal to the bystanders ? If he had, his threat was at once opportune and effectual. Cowed into submission, she was led down the steps to the waterside across the gangway \u2014 on deck \u2014 on to a saloon \u2014 to a berth, stumbling as she went, blind and dizzy with the chaos in her brain. There she was left in a dazed stupor which bore some affinity to a swoon."], [36, "24 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. Fortunately or unfortunately the waves were not in the most amiable mood. Emily was an untried sailor ; the noise overhead of shuffling feet, the creaking and straining of blocks and cables, the rattling of chains, the plunging of ballast-weights or luggage, distracted still more her troubled brain ; then came that horrible nausea which blots out all other distresses of the mind or body. When, after fifteen hours of such discipline,-the vessel steamed in between the long piers of Dunkirk, Emily was as passive as a ten-years' child. The fisherwomen watching for their husbands boats marked the fair face and drooping form as she left the steamer, hanging listlessly on her father's arm, and compas sionated her roughly one to another \u2014 but she saw not them. She caught a faint glimpse of white gaiters, a tight waist, and blue uniform, as their luggage was hauled into the customs' house for inspection; but how their passports were vised, how long they were detained, or how far they walked in the wake of a woman wheeling a truck with their boxes, before they reached a retired estaminet, she was blissfully unconscious. Bed piled on bed, mattrass above mattrass, soothed the wretched, weary, worn-out creature to repose \u2014 repose through which she scented again the sea, the tar, and the weed ; heard the hoarse commands of the captain, the surge and dash of the waves, the rattling, creaking, and shuffling upon deck ; felt the rolling, swaying, and vibration of the boat ; heard her father's low-voiced threats, and then \u2014 oblivion. This was broken at length by music, which seemed like that of another world. By the time she was awake the music had ceased. She lay still, only longing to lapse again into unconsciousness. In about fifteen minutes the wondrous music stirred the air again, and then the deep-toned bell followed the three-quarter chime, and the hour was tolled out from Dunkirk Tower. It was six o'clock : the sun streaming in through the muslin curtains revealed that another day had dawned upon the world, and that she must have slept throughout an afternoon and night. She opened the casement ; the breeze fresh from the sea fanned her hot temples and swept back her disordered hair, as one by one she summoned back her wandering wits, and for the first time since the coach door closed upon her and her home, coherent thought came to her aid. Thought shaped itself into prayer \u2014 that unfailing refuge of the sad, the helpless, the distressed\u2014 and with it came strength and composure. She felt that she was as near to the Ruler of the Universe in France as in England ; that whatsoever violence her"], [37, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 25 father might plan, Deity alone could dispose the course of events. Reason and reflection bade her hope. She consoled herself with the assurance that her husband would not sit down tamely under her loss, but follow and bear her back, in spite of opposition. Poor thing! She could not calculate the deliberate craft which had planned her abduction, so as to leave no clue ! Gerhard's hasty summons to breakfast found her prepared. That over, ten minutes' walk, again in the wake of a porteress and truck, brought them to the canal side. A market boat, the Jean Bart, laden with chattering women and their commodities, was on the point of starting for Bergues, an old fortified town about eleven miles from Dunkirk, on the way to Lille and Douai. A few sous secured their passage, and soon Emily, roused from her apathy by the novelty of the scene, found herself an object of general observation. The serene, Madonna-like faces of these country women attracted her atten tion in turn ; the smoothly-banded hair under closely-fitting white caps, the coloured cotton kerchiefs primly pinned across their busts, the short darklinsey skirts, neat leather shoes, and grey stockings, the universal hooded cloak of blue cloth, thrown back in deference to the heat, contrasted strangely in her English eyes with the gold chains, crosses, finger-rings, and long ear pendants worn with such profusion. With this transient observa tion ended her interest in her fellow-passengers, and as she watched the gurgling water lap the sides of the vessel bearing them so calmly to their destiny, she relapsed into sadness and melancholy. Not transient, however, was the interest she herself awakened. In the first place, she was English, the child of a detested race ; in the second, she had embarked with marked reluctance, under compulsion, and in evident fear of her dark-skinned thin-faced, keen-eyed companion, whose features, not less than his tongue, proclaimed him kin to France, if not of it ; thirdly, she was young, and undoubtedly in trouble \u2014 a fact these simple women no sooner mastered than one after another lifted her rosary and said an \" Ave \" for the stranger, albeit an alien. Three months later, the same lips followed the same sad woman with hisses and execrations. As the white gables of Bergues \u2014 nestling under the shadows of convent and odd pepper-box-mounted church \u2014 loomed in the distance, the sluggish motion of the gaily-painted barge came to a temporary pause at a lock ; there a man and woman were in waiting, and there Gerhard intimated his intention to land. The man, whom he called Antoine, stepped on board for the luggage,"], [38, "26 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. but there being more than he could manage, even with the help of the travellers, a passenger stepped out of the cabin and volunteered his assistance to carry Monsieur's \" baggage \" for a small gratuity, an ofler accepted only after some chaffering on the part of Gerhard, whose money stuck fast to his fingers always. He was a short, thick-set man, strong and muscular, who shouldered a heavy box and a carpet bag with an ease which called forth some remark from Emily. In reply to a consequent question of Vaudubon's, he said that was nothing to the sacks of flour he lifted daily, and, point ing across the level plain to one of the many windmills, observed that he worked for Jean Malmedy, the miller, that his own name was Paul Verhamme, and that he and his master were Belgians both. He was very communicative ; but Emily, on whose ears the speech fell like so much jargon, regarded him, to say the least, with disfavour, and kept close by the side of the female, whom Gerhard addressed as Madame Brille. For a little way their road lay under the shade of the straggling poplars by the canal side, then they struck amongst the low fringe of bushes, into a by-path which led across the open country to a solitary farm-house hid in a perfect bower of fruit trees. Here preparations had evidently been made to receive themr and here the man Paul lingered longer than was at all necessary, officiously undertaking to carry his load to its ultimate resting place ; and Emily afterwards remembered that his glance wandered round the room, as if taking an inventory of its contents, from the handsome bed, and the French clock under its glass shade, to the clothless table, straight-backed chairs, and square stove. She was glad \u2014 she knew not why \u2014 when he was gone. Next morning Gerhard informed his daughter, in a cold, business-like fashion, that until her English marriage was dis solved, and one more to his liking contracted, that farm would be her home. \"If you want employment, Madame Brille will find you plenty. Books are in your luggage. I wish to place no more restraint on your movements than I can avoid. You are free to wander in the neighbourhood, for without money and without. passport escape is impossible.\" It was in vain she tried to move him ; appealed to his love for her dead mother ; but that had never been a very strong passion."], [39, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 27 and her eloquence was lost. Then she strove to touch his soul, and besought him, as he hoped for mercy from his Heavenly Father, to show mercy unto her, but he only shrugged his shoulders ; his fear of God was no greater than had been his love for her mother. Money was his only God. She made the most of the liberty accorded her, and went out. Antoine, on a ladder reared against a tree, was gathering cherries. She asked her way to the town she saw about a mile off \u2014 its name she did not know. The Clerkenwell school had not numbered French amongst its accomplishments, and her father had invariably used English in his intercourse with her. Antoine spoke no English; so, after much jabbering and gesticulation, she left the garden to find her way as best she might. Not that she was curious to explore the quaint, quiet, behind the-time market town, but she knew that the more she was seen abroad, the more likely was she to be found in that untiring quest on which she depended. Once or twice she lost her way amongst intersecting paths, but the country was open, with no dense foliage to bewilder,. and she came at length upon a highway, between thin, ragged, scattered bushes, not to be called hedges, with a brook wimpling along its course. Following that, she reached the Octroi Gate, and, straying through, entered the town. Mastering her timidity, she accosted several persons, but was answered in an unintel ligible patois. But, indeed, had she spoken Parisian French she might not have been in much better plight, for in Bergues, as in other places on the Belgian frontier, only the upper classes speak French ; the tradespeople use a mixed patois, whilst the com monality speak Flemish, or rather Walloon. Guided by a railway whistle, and one or two bustling people in travelling gear, she found her way to the platform of the little railway station. And there, day after day, she might have been seen peering curiously into carriages, and passengers' faces, hoping, with a faith which grew fainter with the passing weeks, to see an English face she knew \u2014 the face dear above all others. Could the true heart worrying Jekyl from day to day but have divined how near she was, what crime, what agony, had haply been averted ! Few English visited Bergues \u2014 that Vaudubon well knew. It had no attractions for idlers or sight-seers ; was too hot in summer, too bleak in winter, for invalids ; was so close at hand that, supposing Avery possessed means to institute a search, it would certainly be overlooked, whilst Switzerland, as his birth place, would be the ground scrutinized. Besides which, he"], [40, "28 THE WATCHMAKERS DAUGHTER. owned the farm and other property- in the neighbourhood, and \u2014 living was cheap. Weeks went by. Emily grew thinner and paler as she lost hope. She would have dropped a letter in the Poste-restante, could she have compassed the means. Neither pen, ink, or paper lay in her way, and she had no money, not a sous. All precautions had been taken. She strove to move Madame Brille, but, however well that matron contrived to understand her new inmate on domestic matters, she became obtuse on anything beyond, and her broken English broke off altogether whenever an appeal for writing materials was made to her. Antoine, who lived on the farm, and slept in a sort of loft at the top of a ladder in the very midst of gardening implements and stores, was as deaf and impenetrable as his aunt. Her father was equally immovable. Bent on dissolving his daughter's marriage, Gerhard Vaudubon consulted various legal authorities. Dissatisfied with the opinion of one, he flew to another, only to learn that he had exceeded his province ; that born in England of an English mother, himself naturalised, she was herself an English subject, and not amenable to the French law of marriage. Every fresh confirmation of his error served to exasperate him the more, but with an obstinate persistence, worthy a better cause, he resolved to withhold his daughter from Edward Avery until forced to resign her, trusting to his own precautions to make that a distant chance. He was likewise endeavouring to secure a patent in France as well as in England for his watch, which he had entered among the list of articles to be shown at the Paris Exhibition the follow ing year. These and other business transactions called him from home and Bergues frequently ; but on such occasions Emily was not permitted to stray far beyond the farm without the attendance of Antoine or Pierre, a farmer lad. On one of these occasions Emily secreted what few trinkets she possessed, and doubled her under-garments as far as was practicable without danger of exciting by bulk the suspicions of Argus-eyed Madame Brille, resolved on an effort to free herself, since watchful Antoine was away with his master. She had picked up odd words and phrases which might serve her turn, and hoped, if by following the line of canal she could only reach Dunkirk, to sell her small stock of jewellery, purchase means to communicate with Edward, and then wait his comin\u00ab in some unsuspected retreat. True, the trinkets had either been her mother's or the gift of her lover, but if they served to reunite her to her beloved husband they would be well sold."], [41, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 29 Accordingly, with a nod to Madame Brille, who sat at the open casement preparing vegetables for the pot-au-feu, she sauntered out, with only a handkerchief tied loosely on her head as a protection from the sun, and to suggest the narrow area of her stroll. Madame Brille's seat commanded a wide sweep of country, and only the belt of coppice which bordered the canal hid the towing path from view. Aware of this, the better to mislead her duenna, Emily Avery bent her steps towards the town itself, intending so to reach the canal bank, and believing the detour better than the risk of being followed. She lost thus half-an-hour. In that half-hour the issues of freedom or captivity, life or death were balanced. Within a mile of Dunkirk, whilst she was resting on a stone under the shadow of a bush, congratulating herself on her escape, a larger and deeper shadow came between herself and the glaring sun. She lifted her head. Her father and Antoine were passing. They saw her. The rest is soon told. She was forced back, and from that day was never suffered beyond the precincts of the farm without an escort. PART IV. THE MODEL WATCH. Hitherto she had remained comparatively passive in her father's hands ; henceforth she grew rebellious. Instead of imploring and entreating as heretofore, she became angry and vehement, remonstrated, insisted on being released ; affirmed that he had no right to detain her, that he kept her there against all law, and that he knew it, and in her very impotence she threatened him. \" I may be powerless to help myself, but the judgment of God will come upon you for your inhumanity some day \u2014 I know it will, I know it will.\" \" Threatened people live long,\" was her father's sole reply, as little moved by her passion as by her tears. She had never been a woman of strong mind, and what she had seemed likely to leave her ; her temper grew fitful, varying from moodiness to storm, and her rare beauty faded with her hopes. The Swiss Vaudubon, who left his mountains once or twice to"], [42, "30 the watchmaker's daughter. visit the farm, obtained an inkling that all was not right. He observed the wedding-ring, which Emily had latterly resumed in \u25a0defiance of opposition, and thereupon taxed Gerhard with decep tion. The old man told his version of the story, but the younger one, whose empty coffers had made wealthy beauty a sufficiently tempting bait to overpower all scruples of social position without troubling himself for the young lady's consent, had sufficient nobility to be shocked when he discovered he had been deemed capable of trampling on another man's rights. The two got to high words ; the nobler man departed indig nantly, leaving the Clerkenwell watchmaker in high dudgeon. With his departure a cloud settled upon Gerhard Vaudubon ; even his idolised watch seemed to lose its charm. Between himself and Emily altercations were frequent. He aged rapidly ; conscience pricked him, but his life-boast had been that he never was defeated, and so the obstinate old man wound his lithe fingers together, set his teeth, and muttered, \" Possession is nine tenths of the law.\" Three months had elapsed from the date of Jekyl 's induction into the old watchmaker's business. His first instalment was due. He travelled to Bergues, according to agreement, to pay the sum into Vaudubon's own hands, and to report progress. Gerhard met him at the railway station, conveyed him to the \" Chapeau Rouge,\" but carefully avoided any possible danger of contact or collusion between him and the young wife pining at the farm. There were no other persons in the public room at the quiet inn when they went in, but in the very midst of their accounts and calculations two persons entered, and seated themselves at an opposite table. They were Paul Verhamme and the miller Malmedy. These men drank their vin ordinaire in comparative silence, whilst the conversation between the two watchmakers continued unbroken ; nor, had they been cognisant of these men's presence would it have been otherwise, since the new comers were known to be Belgians, and their conversation was carried on in English. Gerhard's back was towards the other table, else his keen eyes would have noted in the miller and his friend much which Jekyl only remembered when too late. Glances of intelligence passed between the twain, when Jekyl handed over to his former master a roll of crisp bank notes, which the recipient counted over with much precision ere he placed them in a well-worn pocket-book. Then the man Paul pricked up his ears when, the \"patent\" question being under discussion, the remarkable watch was pro-"], [43, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 31 duced and opened to illustrate some principle not fully compre hended by Jekyl, some peculiar movements on which the inventor based his right to a patent. About this time the two men left the house. After that, Jekyl, who had never held himself absolved from his tacit share in the separation of husband and wife since he witnessed the distress of Edward Avery, ventured haphazard upon dangerous ground. He dared to intercede for the severed pair, proclaimed how his own conscience smote him as the silent holder of a base secret ; pictured the agony of the young man for the loss of his wife ; his efforts to discover her retreat ; spoke of Avery's business qualifications ; of his exemplary life ; combated Gerhard's tenacious belief that Avery was a tricky fortune-hunter ; insisted that Edward to that very day remained ignorant that his father-in-law possessed any property beyond his rights in the business. Contrary to Jekyl's expectation, Vaudubon listened \u2014 moreover, he promised to think about it. Nevertheless, he contrived to hurry his late foreman away, and never lost sight of him until he was borne off by the vanishing train. Days are tolerably long in September, yet it was dusk when Gerhard Vaudubon slowly left the platform to return home, apparently in a brown study. Jekyl's untutored eloquence had moved him more than he was willing to admit; besides, the old dreams of his wife and sons had latterly returned to scare him \u2014 a superstitious man. He began to think that he was old, that it would be hard to pass to the grave unloved, when a word of his might create a home such as he had never known since he left Lausanne. Jekyl's remark that \" the only good of money was the good done with it, the comfort it brought,\" oppressed him. His money had done him no good ; brought comfort for no one, not even for himself. Who cared for the invention which had cost him so many years of patient thought ? Not even his own \u2022child. Would it be possible to surrender without owning himself defeated ? He would go home and think of it. Wrapped in thought, he had wandered out of his way into the very heart of the town, grey and cold in the deepening shadows. \" It is too far to go back,\" said he to himself. \" I'll e'en go by the canal side, and up through the coppice. It's nearest, and, if it's lonely \u2014 why, so are the streets at this hour. I shall get home the sooner.\" Aye \u2014 and no ! They are honest people in Bergues, apt to leave their doors on the latch, and are not troubled to require the luxury of a lock."], [44, "32 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. Not so confiding was Gerhard Vaudubon ; he imported some outre English notions respecting \"locks, bolts, and bars,\" and whenever he was likely to remain late in an evening carried with him the key of a substantial spring-lock, fitted to the door by his own hand. Its removal from the nail assigned to it was a signal well understood by Madame Brille, and which Emily had not been slow to observe. Antoine and his aunt had been busy all day gathering grapes and apples for the next day's market ; Emily had therefore been left in the house alone \u2014 an opportunity long desired. Cautiously she stole to her father's room to resume a search often commenced, and as often interrupted \u2014 the search for her passport, and money for a journey. He had an old-fashioned oak cabinet, scrupulously kept locked. By some mischance he had left the key in a waist coat pocket, and with its help she found all and more than she needed. There was gold in abundance \u2014 napoleons and sovereigns both \u2014 mortgages, bills of exchange, bonds, coupons, title-deeds \u2014 enough, and more than enough, to prove her father's boast of wealth no fable. She hastily replaced all papers but the one, counted out twenty pieces of gold, resolving to repay it some day, and returned to her own room to await nightfall. Madame and Antoine had barely basketed their fruit, when the vesper bell sounded from church and convent in the distance. Impatiently Emily sat out the lingering supper, assisted to clear the things away, and inwardly chafed when Antoine sat down afterwards to smoke and talk. She thought they would never go to bed. At length Antoine yawned, put out his pipe, stumbled up the ladder to his bed in the attic, and Madame Brille mounted her high mattresses and closed the blue-check curtains. She was fat and puffy, and soon snored heavily. The nasal trumpet was Emily's signal. She stepped lightly from her room, drew back the spring-bolt as the ornamental clock was on the stroke of ten, and, with a bundle ou her arm, passed out into the night, closing the door softly behind her. She knew the gate creaked on its hinges, and, striving to open it quietly, dropped the latch and increased the noise. Her heart beat, but the sleepers slept on, and she walked briskly forward, so as to cross the path which led from the high road before her father should reach it. With a beating pulse she trod the field path to the canal, little conscious that her father, by a strange fatality \u2014 the very softening of his soul towards her \u2014 had chosen that for his homeward route."], [45, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 33 Unused to be out after nightfall, brought up in the heart of London, the silence was appalling. Every sound startled her : if a night moth glanced past, or a humming beetle droned close to her ear, she shrank within herself. Once a long-eared bat drove blindly against her face, and she cried out. Her own voice terrified her more than all ; but she took herself to task, and with fresh courage stepped forward. She had gained the shadow of the straggling fringe of coppice, when she heard approaching footsteps and voices. Not daring either to go on or to return, she quitted the narrow path, and wound amongst the bushes so as to gain the canal bank some distance ahead. Barely had she left the sheltering bushes than she heard sounds which chilled her \u2014 the thud of heavy blows, a scuffle, a faint cry of \" Murder ! \" on the night air, another blow, a crash through the thicket as of a falling body, the sound of retreating footsteps, and then \u2014 silence. What hideous deed had been perpetrated she knew not, dreamed not ; her own safety was her sole thought, as she flew rather than ran along the towing-path. Weary in body and mind, oppressed with the weight of a murderous knowledge, she approached Dunkirk about half-an hour after midnight \u2014 too late to seek lodgings without exciting suspicion. Under a ricketty old shed outside the town she found shelter, until the marvellous chimes, followed by the hour, and the bell for the Angelus, told her that the world was awake. Her few words of French, backed by a gold napoleon, procured her a breakfast ; but the tide did not serve for the London boat until evening, and she spent the intermediate hours in extreme trepidation. The time did pass, however. Her passport was all right ; the boat lay alongside the pier ; black smoke and white steam poured from rival funnels ; she stepped on board ; thanked God that she was safe \u2014 was drawn back by a gend'arme \u2014 was charged with a crime, from the very echo of which her soul shrank appalled. Picture the amazement of Madame Brille and her nephew in the morning, on discovering that Mademoiselle Vaudubon had escaped during the night, and that Monsieur, her father, had not returned home ! Fat as she was, she hurried hither and thither in ludicrous agitation, giving contradictory orders to Antoine, and cuffs to Pierre, the boy who came every morning to do odd jobs about the farm. What could she say to Monsieur when he came home ? Ah, lucky thought, perhaps Antoine might overtake the runaway. D"], [46, "34 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. and save herself from everlasting disgrace. He must not delay \u2014 he must haste \u2014 he must run ! Quite as unwilling to risk the anger of Monsieur Vaudubon as was madame, Antoine set forth at the top of his speed towards the canal, sending Pierre off at a tangent to the high road. Rain had fallen heavily two days previously, the ground was soft ; he saw the print of a little foot before him, and knew he was on the track. Ah, what was that crowd within the coppice ? Surely Made moiselle was found, Monsieur would rejoice ! Filled with his own idea, Antoine called out pantingly as he neared the group \u2014 \" You have caught Mademoiselle ? You have the runaway young lady ? You \u2014 No ! Mon Dieu ! What is this ? Horreur I 'tis Monsieur ! \" Yes, Monsieur Gerhard Vaudubon, murdered and plundered ! His long life was cut short, his last breath was drawn ! The group around the murdered man was composed of market people travelling by the Jean Bart, then moored close to the bank. One of the women had observed something like a man's foot concealed amongst the bushes ; other eyes and voices had seconded hers. Men leapt hastily on land, and to their dismay brought to light a battered corpse, recognised by more than one as his who had alighted near that spot three months before in company with a young English girl. Just as this discovery was made, Antoine, leaving the path, came dashing through the bushes in eager expectation, only to be paralysed with horror at the unexpected sight. Presently the gardes-champetre were on the spot, the place was examined, and Antoine, followed by the bulk of the crowd, cari-ied before the Mayor of the Commune, where they were speedily joined by Madame Brillein a state of extreme agitation. From the statements of herself and Antoine, made in all honesty and good faith, Emily was suspected of being the murderess, and on the accuser's proces verbal, the gensd'arme were set on the unfortunate woman's track. We saw how she was captured, with one foot on the steamer which she expected would bear her back to happiness. We did not see the sudden revulsion of feeling, the recoil at the imputa tion, the shock of the charge itself, the remembrance of the cries and struggle she had heard, all working at once upon her. With a cry like nothing earthly, she gasped, \" Murdered, murdered ! Surely not close to the canal ? \" It was an unfortunate exclamation. \" Ah, Mademoiselle, you seem to know all about it,\" remarked"], [47, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 35 one of the gensd'arme, as she, overpowered by so many conflict ing emotions, fainted, and was carried in that condition back to the pier. Madame Brille had affirmed that Mademoiselle had no money whatever; \"not a sou;\" yet in searching her a quantity of both French and English coin was found, and Gerhard's pockets had been rifled. For her footprints among the bushes Emily accounted by saying that she had crept into their midst to avoid some persons who would otherwise have met her in the path. She emphatically denied having threatened her father, and Madame Brille as emphatically asserting the contrary and repeating the words employed. Madame knew more English than Emily had credited her with \u2014 quite enough to be dangerous. It so happened that, like many solitary persons, the desolate girl had acquired a habit of talking to herself, and with one subject ever before her mind had frequently repeated her father's threat towards Edward, \" I will be the death of him. He shall rue it.\" This, in conjunction with her open denunciation of the \"judgment of God,\" was sufficiently condemnatory. Yet no blood had been found on the girl's dress or person, and the blows had apparently been struck by a powerful hand, wielding a blunt instrument. She was too slight to have dealt any such ; nor could she, unassisted, have dragged the body from the scene of the struggle to its hiding-place, at least thirty yards away. Besides, Vaudubon's watch was still missing. It was plain she must have had an accomplice, if not more, as there were other and larger footprints than hers about the scene of the struggle ; she was, therefore, urged to give him or them up to justice. The course of criminal law in England is all in favour of the accused, who is held to be innocent until found guilty. In France it is otherwise ; the accused is considered, and treated, as if guilty until proved innocent. As any means are therefore considered justifiable which tend to bring home guilt to the accused, and prevent a miscarriage of justice, prisoners under suspicion are subjected to private exami nation and cross-questionings previously to trial, are so badgered and baited to extort condemnatory evidence, that justice not un frequently goes astray very widely, driving sensitive and tender innocence to insane confession, when hardness and impenitence \u2014 if sufficiently cunning and adroit \u2014 has in its very preparedness a chance of escape. And here let me intimate that I am relating a case in point from veritable fact in this story. On this principle Emily Avery was sent to prison at Douai to"], [48, "36 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. await her trial, and, notwithstanding her unmistakable condition consigned to a narrow dungeon without light or air beyond wha came through an aperture the size of a brick. There she lay quite two months in solitary confinement, only brought into daylight for the application of the moral thumbscrew known as \"preliminary examinations.\" Brow-beaten, catechised, perplexed with cross-questions, urged to confess by promises, threatened with further incarceration for contumacy, wrought to frenzy, the juge d'instruction obtained from this innocent young creature all he required \u2014 a confession. This was followed by two days' delirium, during which the hapless prisoner, so soon to be a mother, attempted her own life. Bleeding and a strait-jacket were the remedies applied. Brought before the Cour d' Assize no one would have known her for the beautiful girl who seven months before had married in secret, only to repent at leisure. Her hair, once so rich and glossy, had the hue and aspect of tangled hemp ; her eyes, once so deep a violet, were light and lustreless \u2014 therefore pronounced cold and cruel by prejudging spectators. Her features, pinched, colourless, and rigid, were in like manner declared \" hard and stern.\" The Greffier read the long acte d' accusation, in which she, Emily Vaudubon, calling herself Avery, was charged with con spiring, aiding, and abetting, with persons not in custody, in the murder and robbery of Gerhard Vaudubon, her own father. The president of the court questioned her (of course through an in terpreter), witnesses (all dead against her) were examined, and finally her own extorted confession was produced. There she owned herself the murderess, but declined to impli cate anyone else. It was all-sufficient. Though nothing, absolutely nothing, to connect her with the terrible deed could be proved beyond the bad terms on which the deceased and prisoner had lived \u2014 the so-called threats she uttered, the gold in her pocket, the possession of her passport, the time and manner of her secret flight, her footprints to and around the scene of the murder, her exclamation when arrested (all of which she attempted to explain) \u2014 she was, on her written confession, found guilty by the jury, and condemned to the galleys for life (travaux forces a perpetuite). When the unexpected sentence was made known to her she screamed, appealed to the court, declared her confession was extorted under compulsion, and false ; and exclaimed that \" whenever her father's watch was found, the true murderer ivould be found: she was as much a victim as her father had been !\""], [49, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 37 Justice was inexorable ; people shrugged their shoulders, and the prisoner, writhing in mental and bodily agony, was borne away, exclaiming, \" God and man have deserted me ! \" She was mistaken. Into the narrow cell where her immature babe was born, and for want of common care died within a week, news of the outer world never penetrated ; but within that week two events transpired which, however they might affect others wrought only good for her ; and proved that man's extremity is only God's opportunity. Jekyl (or Mr. Jekyl as he was then called), transacting business with a watchmaker in Ostend, had his attention attracted to a very remarkable watch, which had been offered for sale and purchased as a curiosity about two months previously. Jekyl at once recognised the watch as Vaudubon's ; declared that the owner would never have parted with it save with life; put many close questions respecting the seller ; announced his sus picion of foul play, and being no niggard, offered to defray all expenses if Doise, the watchmaker, would accompany him at once to Bergues, bearing the watch with him. They found the town in commotion. Another murder had ieen perpetrated the preceding night ! Madame Brille and Monsieur Vaudubon's names were on every tongue, and in less than half-an-hour the strangers were acquainted with the facts of both murders so far as they were known. The boy Pierre, going as usual to his work in the morning, had found the door wide open, Antoine bleeding, but sensible, at the foot of the ladder stairs ; Madame Brille quite dead, on the floor by her bedside, and the whole house in disorder. He at once spread the alarm, medical aid was procured, Antoine's proces.verbal taken, and gensd'arme set to guard the farm from intrusion. Antoine, who had never slept soundly since their landlord was killed, had lain awake thinking of the poor young creature who had seemed so harmless when she came there first, and wondering whether she really could have done so much mischief at the last. Suddenly he was disturbed by the creaking of the garden gate and the turn of a key in the spring lock. He jumped out of bed, armed himself from his ready stores with a pruning-knife, and descended the ladder, to find two men already in the room, which was lit up by the moonlight streaming through the open door. Before he could turn round both sprang upon him, and, although he wounded one of them, his weapon was wrested from liim, and himself struck down. His aunt, sleeping in the common household room, roused by"], [50, "38 THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. the din, recognised the men, and called them by name, and they at once turned upon her. Antoine grew faint with loss of blood, and distinguished sounds no more. The men, he averred, were Paul Verhamme and Jean Malmedy ; and he affirmed, moreover, that whosoever had that key, and knew the lock it fitted, must have murdered Monsieur Vaudubon, who had brought the lock from England, and had carried the key with him the night he was killed. The house had been ransacked, Vaudubon's cabinet broken open, its contents despoiled ; but one of the depredators had left a thumb behind him on the kitchen floor, and was consequently a marked man. Antoine's wounds were deep and dangerous ; his recovery slow and doubtful ; but long before he was able to go about, the two men he had denounced were in safe keeping, In the outset, Jekyl, absolved by Vaudubon's death from oath or promise, telegraphed to Edward Avery, who was with him in less than forty-eight hours. His wife was found \u2014 but, alas ! how ? The rule of red tape extends far and wide ; the rule of red gold extends farther and wider. A message written in letters of gold on an open palm had penetrated to the dungeon where a babe lay dead, and a young mother almost dying. It told her she was not deserted, and bade her \" hope.\" It was the first light which had dawned on her soul for many weary months. Under its influence she slowly rallied. A second brief message followed, to tell that her husband was exerting himself to prove her innocence. And now Emily no longer desponded. That she was found by her husband was joy in itself; that he would prove her innocence she never doubted. She never questioned his power to achieve whatsoever he attempted, and calculated his influence over others by the influence he ever had over herself. Meanwhile Avery and Jekyl were less sanguine than the prisoner. They had little more than hope to work upon, for, not knowing all that has been revealed to the reader, and finding at every step their imperfect knowledge of the language an impediment to enquiry, even the sanguine and energetic young husband felt his spirits flag at times. Doise, the Belgian watchmaker, had gone back to Ostend and his own business, leaving the model watch behind in the hands of the authorities, with a full description of the person who had sold it to him ; a portrait which the police had no difficulty in fitting with a name, and that \"Paul Verhamme.\""], [51, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 39 Antoine had been left for dead. No sooner was his existence noised abroad than the assassins fled in contrary directions, Vaudubon's gold aiding their escape. But the one who had left his thumb behind, was a marked man ! They were arrested, both, within twelve hours of each other, subjected to the customary process, and, under its salutary administration, made each a confession, throwing as much guilt on his comrade and as little on himself as possible, but thoroughly exculpating the old man's daughter from any participation in their crime. Vaudubon had owned too much property in Bergues to pass for a poor man there ; and the robbery of the miser at the farm had been planned on the very night of their arrival, when Verhamme had taken the opportunity of his volunteer porterage to survey the premises. Bolts and bars made the attempt unpromising, and postponed it. The chance sight of Vaudubon's gold watch, and the notes paid over by Jekyl to him at the Chapeau Rouge, had stimulated the rogues' cupidity and hastened his own end. The key found upon Gerhard gave them a chance they were not likely to throw away ; and no sooner was some one else fairly convicted of the murder than they resolved to try their luck again. Ah ! once and too often for them. They were tried at Douai for the murder of Madame Brille, and the attempted murder of Antoine. Edward Avery was in court following the case with eager anxiety, much worn and aged since the day he stood in that quiet Islington church, radiant with hope and happiness, his newly made wife by his side. Doise also was there, and Jekyl, who, feeling that his wife had sown the seeds of these disasters, had done all he could to make reparation. His purse, though not too deep, had opened freely. The door-key was produced in court and the lock also ; both were of peculiar construction \u2014 in fact, had been Vaudubon's own contrivance, had been made in England, and no duplicates were known to be extant in France. This supposition was backed by Antoine's affirmation that it was the self-same key Gerhard Vaudubon carried, attested by his indicating two notches on the stem as a token. Gerhard's watch was then produced, Jekyl identifying that, and Doise identifying the man who sold the same to him. Moreover, Vaudubon's old pocket-book had been found in company with a heap of such relics in the now deserted mill, so that, even had the prisoners not confessed to the murder of Gerhard Vaudubon, there was sufficient evidence to inculpate them. Jekyl at once recognised them as the two men present"], [52, "THE WATCHMAKER'S DAUGHTER. 40 atihe Chapeau Rouge on the 5th of August, when he paid the notes over, and examined the watch. Their conviction of the murder of Madame Brille, the desperate wounding of Antoine, and the robbery at the farm, did not, however, even in conjunction with their confessions, release Emily ; but the execution of her sentence was deferred. Brought before the Court of Cassation, the complicated case was recon sidered, the conflicting judgments were annulled, and a fresh trial was appointed. It was weary waiting for the impatient husband, longing so eagerly for the release of his adored wife ; still more weary waiting for the condemned woman in her cell, whose innocence had yet to be proved to the satisfaction of the law. The day of trial came. Emily was once more brought up a prisoner. On beholding her husband in the court she shrieked and fainted. He, separated from her, could hardly control his emotion on witnessing the change that sorrow had wrought in the features and form so dear to him. She recovered consciousness to find Paul Verhamme and his nominal master, Malmedy, arraigned there also ; but this time she had many friends in the court, the tide had turned in her favour, and little remained but to acquit her of com plicity. In answer to the President's interrogations why she admitted the murder if not guilty, it transpired that she had been incar cerated in a dismal hole, deprived of air and exercise, threatened with still more rigorous treatment if obdurate, and, dreading lest her infant should be born in such a dungeon, declared herself guilty to save herself and babe from its horrors, and that immedi ately thereupon her mind gave way. A searching inquiry was made by the Procureur- General : gaoler, doctor, interpreter, all were interrogated, their reluctant evidence confirming hers. A confession extorted from fear which produced temporary insanity, and which wanted other corroboration, was void : to sav nothing of the exculpatory confessions of the actual murderers \u2014 Verhamme and Malmedy.

However can you expect to get married, dressing as you do, with no more style than if you were a Quakeress ? \" \"My dear sister Laura, were I a man I should prefer a Quakeress to a clothes-peg. It is a marvel to me how any girl with common sense can consent to become a milliner's model.\" \" Nonsense, Barbara !

The fashion of Chocktaw Indians, or the Chinese, or the Esquimaux ? Beyond the narrow orbit of your sphere are scores of fashions, not one whit more outre than those which emanate from London or Paris ; \" and Barbara, who was calmly tying the strings of her unobtrusive bonnet, looked up archly. \" Now, Barbara, to hear you talk anyone would think you were the elder sister instead of the younger. But I've heard Mr. Devereaux say that ' beauty costs no more than ugliness.' \" \" In many cases it costs much less ; but I think if Mr. Devereaux were asked to define ' beauty,' he would not point to a fashion plate as an illustration.

He said, yesterday, he must tie you down to your own monthly allowance, and one may be iceM-dressed without being expensively dressed \u2014 at least / think so.\" And so might anyone have thought who, with equal capacity to calculate expenditure and results, unbiassed by the passing whim of fashion, could have looked on those half-sisters, as equipped for a flower-show they tripped into their drawing-room, where Mr. Devereaux, a young barrister from Lincoln's Inn, was already waiting to be their escort. I have said they were half-sisters. Their father, Jonathan Buckley, was a solicitor in Chester, highly respected in his con fraternity, and beyond it. His house on the Walls overlooked the Roodee ; and there, where his first wife had died, Barbara's mother spent the whole of her married life until she also was laid in the grave along with her predecessor, to whose little Laura she had been, as a stepmother, only too kind. Laura, four years old at her own mother's death, had been borne away from the widower's hearth by a maiden aunt, her mother's sister ; and when in less than six months the lonely man married again, Miss Chippendale vowed that her dear sister's child should never go back to be trampled under foot by a step mother. And Mr. Buckley being a quiet man, not caring for contention, let Miss Chippendale have her own way. Her own way was to ignore the lapse of years, and to dress as if youth and beauty were perennial ; and in order that her sister's child should not suffer in comparison with the new wife's baby Barbara, she attired Laura as absurdly as she dressed herself \u2014 that is, in materials and fashion unsuited alike to age and social position, if one so young could be supposed to have a status in society at all. Perhaps she had \u2014 in school \u2014 the school which Miss Chippen dale (not her father) selected for her ; where dress was distinction, and deportment the primary study. Luckily for Laura, Miss Chippendale was herself carried off by the same grim bedmaker to sleep by her sister's side in the garments of the grave, and then the young damsel, entering on her teens, came under more judicious guardianship."], [56, "44 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. The second Mrs. Buckley was a cultivated woman both mentally, morally, and domestically, and, allowed a fair field, might have been to Laura all she was to her own daughter. But the seeds of vanity and display had been sown. Mrs. Buckley hoped to check their development ; and had she been strong or subtle enough to cope with one so early indoctrinated with rebellion against a step-mother's authority, she might have succeeded more effectually. As it was she died when Barbara was little more than seventeen, and Laura, aged twenty -two, rejoiced in the com parative freedom of full age, and the reversion of a small property which had been her aunt's. Mr. Buckley was not a rich man, though he had a tolerable practice. Whatever fortune his first wife had brought to him, she had herself dissipated in the few brief years of her reign, and little remained to save for her child. Yet he had con scientiously set that little aside, and nursed it to larger growth as a sort of marriage portion, knowing well that in their quiet old city husbands were at a premium ; and that a portionless maiden ran some risk of recruiting the ranks of Chester's army of ancient spinsterhood. Hitherto the maiden had waited, and the portion had waited ; the one accumulating years, the other accumulating interest, with never a nibble, though Laura, now twenty-five, had angled for it with her prettiest smiles, most winning ways, and bewitching attire, and though Mr. Buckley had in the race-weeks thrown his house (which overlooked the course) open to visitors, and never neglected an opportunity of pressing his hospitality upon eligible clients, whom business carried into his office on the ground floor. Gossip, always awake in the drowsy shadow of a cathedral, had assigned Miss Buckley to her father's articled clerk, Joseph Bancroft, before she had been a month under her father's roof; but her mourning wore out, Joseph Bancroft's articles expired, and be lingered on as an immate of the household, and managing clerk, an eligible young bachelor, for whom many hearts were palpitating besides her own, yet never fed he gossip with stronger food than courtesy to the young ladies to and from their pew in St. Mary's Church. In vain did Miss Buckley, during the long evenings, challenge Mr. Bancroft to a game at chess or ecarte ; or sit down to the piano and plaintively attune her not unmusical voice to the sen timental songs of the day \u2014 \"Go, forget me!\" \"We met,\" \" She wore a wreath of roses ; \" or informed her hearers that she that she dwelt in marble halls ;\" in vain did she work"], [57, "45 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKLRT. mottoed book-marks, or braid watchguards, or cut her fingers in netting silk purses for presentation on any and every colourable anniversary ; the somewhat taciturn clerk was not to be elevated to her pitch of enthusiasm. He accepted her gifts, and used them, but when he freed himself from the debt on the first oppor tunity by the grave presentation of book or music, Barbara was sure of a present also ; and sing as pathetically and tenderly as she would, Laura never moved him from his seat by the lamp-lit table where his brown curls were bent over Chitty, or Coke, or Blackstone ; whilst Barbara sat opposite with book or work, and Mr. Buckley kept the cat companionship in a doze by the fire, or strolled to the Royal Hotel for a whiff of \u2014 fresh air. Moved by a sudden panic, she more than once summoned Barbara to join her in \"What are the wild waves saying? \" \" What fairy-like music !\" cr other equally popular duet ; but for aught she knew (she could not see behind her) the studious young gentleman never lifted his head from his book, and so her tem porary jealousy was appeased. At chess, or ecarte, she had him all to herself, and kept his attention alive ; but it not unfrequently happened that he coolly substituted whist or loo for the tete-a-tete game, and her little artifice was nullified. \"I declare he is as cold as an icicle, and as immovable as a statue ! I don't think he has a heart in his body, or I should have touched it by this time ! I wonder if he has a sweetheart anywhere in that horrid Delamere Forest he comes from. It would not much matter if he was not so provokingly handsome ! \" Such was Laura's testy outburst to Barbara in the privacy of their mutual chamber, after a more than ordinary effort to attract Joseph Bancroft had failed. Barbara was stooping to unlace her boots at the time. Perhaps that was the reason why she made no reply, and why she flushed to the tips of her tiny ears. Stooping does drive the blood to the head so terribly ! But the ice thawed, and the statue awakened to life when the summer assizes of 1846 brought Martin Devereaux down amongst them, with an eloquent tongue to second his eloquent eyes, and the easy confidence of the London bar to assure his fine face and figure against being overlooked. Martin Devereaux held a brief for a client of Mr. Buckley's, and when the case closed on a successful issue, the solicitor, in the ordinary expansiveness of his nature, invited the barrister to \" spend the evening under his humble roof, in company with the client for whom he had con tended so learnedly.\" How much their entertainment added to the client's bill this"], [58, "46 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. deponent sayeth not (Mr. Buckley was never accused of extortion) \u2014 but their entertainment added anything but felicity to the private ruminations of Joseph Bancroft. The fact was that that young gentleman was not so indifferent to feminine influence as Miss Laura conjectured, but so long as he had the field to himself he saw no occasion for self-committal or precipitation. He was studying hard \u2014 both law and something else \u2014 but was not yet enrolled amongst the lawyers entitled to practice throughout the realm of Great Britain ; and though there was something more human than law stirring in the depths of his heart, it scarcely rose prominently to the surface, even for his own inspection, until the self-possessed barrister stood by the side of the sisters at the piano, turned over music, and converted duets into trios with a magnificent voice, which filled the grand old room with a rich volume of sound, until an appreciative glow mantled on the cheeks of the young ladies, and Mr. Buckley was loud in acclamation. That evening was the prelude to another, and another, and yet another. Bouquets came for the sisters in the morning, and the newest music in the evening ; and the young man of twenty- three felt himself distanced by the older one of thirty. He was cast into the shade, was \"nowhere,\" and he told himself it was his own fault. The assizes were over, yet still the barrister lingered, regardless of his swelling bill at the \"Blue Posts ;\" antiquarian proclivities serving as an excuse for his stay, if not altogether for making his explorations in the historic city under feminine guidance. There was a considerable wagging of tongues, and a fluttering of feathers and lace, indoors and out, as the attentions of the elegant Londoner became more palpable, and the question asked by the gossips resolved itself into \" Which ? \" \" Which ? \" was the question Mr. Buckley asked himself com placently in his private office. \"Which?\" was the question Mr. Bancroft put gloomily to himself behind the rails of his desk, as he bit the end of his pen savagely, and answered himself as a lover, who fancies all men must see and covet the same jewel as himself. \" Which ? \" Mr. Devereaux asked himself dubiously after an expedition together to Eaton Hall ; \" they are both charming, and both so different. Miss Barbara would doubtless make the best companion on a man's hearth, but Miss Buckley would make the best figure in society, and do the honours of a dinner-table most effectively. Miss Barbara is the daisy, and Miss Laura the rose, and hang me if I know which to choose. I am not quite"], [59, "THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. 47 sure that the daisy desires to be gathered ; but I think the rose is ready to open her heart to the adventurous bee. However, I can't dally here much longer; to-morrow's flower-show must decide it. I wonder if there's any money stirring. The office looks substantial, and a few hundreds would come in very acceptably just now. I must draw out that oyster- like clerk of Buckley's, he's sure to open under my manipulation. But never an oyster-knife Martin Devereaux had skill to wield would have unclosed that particular bivalve, had not Bancroft laid himself out to be communicative, influenced by a motive the very reverse of the wavering barrister's. Neither cigars, nor unlimited champagne at the \" Blue Posts,\" would ever have extracted from Joseph Bancroft anything Joseph Bancroft had not previously determined to \" let out.\" Consequently, when Martin Devereaux discovered that Miss Buckley was already in possession of a neat little income, derived from a deceased relative, and would most likely have a portion of a thousand or two, whilst Miss Barbara's fortune was proble- matic, he learned no more than Mr. Bancroft was especially anxious to convey to him. How content Joseph Bancroft was to be so \" drawn out \" may be gathered from the following confidential conversation in the long drawing-room which overlooked the Roodee, whilst Laura was overhead preparing a battery of feminine finery for the morrow's flower-show, and Mr. Buckley had not yet found his way home from the Royal Hotel. \"I hope it will be a fine day to -morrow for the show, Barbara, and that you will enjoy yourself.\" \" Oh, yes ! and so do I. I always think it is such a pity if rain comes down when people are gathered together for enjoy- ment,\" she answered, folding up a pair of hose she had been darning. \" Ah, but pleasant company can make even rain endurable, and Mr. Derereaux, between his poetry and his fluency, must have a wonderful fascination for a woman.\" This was said lightly, but the keen glance shot across the hearth-rug at the unconscious girl of nineteen told of more than a light interest in her reply. J^\" Well, Joseph (he had been ten years their inmate), I am not sOiSure of that. He pays too many compliments by one-half, and the poetry he quotes so sensitively, as if it came from his very heart, is just enough to make any girl think he was in love with her, and I don't like it.\" \" Don't like it, Barbara, how so ? \" and he drew closer to her as he spoke."], [60, "48 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. \" Well, it seems to me as if it were got up for effect, and to win a girl's heart whether he wants the girl or not.\" And quiet Barbara put away her work-basket with a shade of annoyance on her face. \" Barbara ! \" There was something in the tone made her heart leap, \"Barbara! \" Which of you do you think Mr. Devereaux is in love with ? \" \" Oh, neither of us, Joseph,\" and her clear grey eyes met his hazel ones fearlessly, though not without a tinge on her cheeks ; \" but,\" and here her voice sank to a whisper, \" I am afraidaLaura fancies he is in earnest.\" \" But suppose he should be in earnest, and propose to carry ofl, not Laura, but our pretty Barbara. What then ? \" The white rose chased the red from the young girl's cheeks and lips, and her hand caught the arm of a chair to steady herself. \" Oh, Joseph, how could you suppose such a thing ? It was cruel of y*ou.\" There was another arm besides that of the chair put forth to support her, and a voice lowered to a whisper asked : \"Barbara, could you believe anyone else was in love with you, someone who is not eloquent, and has no poetry to quote ? \" But Barbara never answered, unless the quivering of her form within his arm, and the tears which rolled from her downcast eyes on the hand clasping hers, was an answer. Yet he must have taken it as an answer, for his clasp tightened, and his lips sought hers as if to set a seal upon a bond. There was a step upon the stair. Barbara broke from the encircling arms and rushed out of the room, brushing past her father without so much as a \"good night,\" and passing into the darkness of the upper landing to still her panting heart, and cool her flushed face before encountering her sister. But Laura was too intent on polishing her gold watch chain (the watch was a conspicuous ornament at that date), to observe Barbara's face, and no sisterly confidence was vouchsafed. The young girl carried her secret to bed, and when Laura addressed to her next morning the words with which this narrative opens, it was with the self-satisfied conviction that Mr. Devereaux was languishing to throw himself at her feet, and that Barbara was doomed to despair and old maidism. It never dawned upon her obtuseness that the immobile, handsome, curly-haired clerk, whom all her arts had failed to win, had made his law-books but a pretext for lingering near despised, portionless Barbara,and reading"], [61, "49 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. the open book of her artless countenance, until love became the law of his life. \" The breath of the sweet south stealing across a bed of violets ! \" gallantly murmured Mr. Devereaux, as he took the dainty lilac-gloved hand in his, and bent over it. \" But your violets, Miss Buckley, charming as their wearer, bloom peren nially ;\" and his eyes rested on the tasteful French challe, the cost of which had not been lessened by the violet cords and tassels pendant from pockets, and sleeves, and girdle, and even looping down at the back the lilac silk scarf which rested on her shoulders. Yet these trimmings were not obtrusive, and the eye, educated by fashion, saw only a tall, elegantly- dressed woman, whom he might be proud to introduce as his wife. Still, as Barbara followed, his glance turned for a moment on the pale pink drawn silk bonnet, unencumbered with feather or flower, and the inexpensive drab delaine, over which meandered a faint rose-coloured weedy pattern (printed materials were then in vogue), and had no adventitious ornament in the way of trimming, save the bow of pink ribbon which closed her collar at the throat. Unskilled as he was to distinguish between the English material and the French, he saw a softened light in the maiden's eye, a warm hue on her cheek, that might be caught from the bonnet ; and as he mentally decided that the tout ensem ble was faultless, he was in danger of forgetting the golden chain round Miss Buckley's violets, and own himself vanquished by simplicity, with no dower but common sense and a pure heart. \" I had expected Mr. Bancroft would bear us company,\" said he, as they left the house, \" but I found him gnashing his teeth in his legal den over the shortcomings of a dilatory law stationer, which might detain him all the day. I am sorry for the mischance. He is a most agreeable fellow, with a remarkable fund of information. His society would doubtless have enhanced your pleasure, ladies.\" Barbara's parasol shifted \u2014 to screen the sun from her face \u2014 but she was silent. Laura laughed lightly. \" Oh, I dare say we shall find Mr. Bancroft's absence endurable,\" but her unspoken thought was, \" It's downright provoking he's not here to take Barbara out of the way, and this Mr. Devereaux's last day too ; I know he means something, but what can he say with her for ever at his elbow ? \" What could he say ? What did he think ?

The odour of flowers, the aroma of fruit, all that is brilliant and soft, gorgeous and delicate in texture and hue, all that is sweet and fragrant steals seductively over the senses at a flower show, when the season is summer, and roses are in their prime. Then music lends its charm, and a low babble of voices from the bevy of animated flowers artificially emulating the blossoms they admire. All cast a halo over the hour, and love is rarely so lover-like. At all events Martin Devereaux made his hay while the sun shone. The flowers helped him to similes, and the speaking eloquence of his soft black eyes pointed the poetry which bubbled up to his tongue from the fountains of memory and inspiration, and whenever the lilac kid gloves came in contact with lavender ones, they felt a lingering pressure which was not accidental. Laura was in the seventh heaven, and Barbara all at once felt herself very much \"intheway,\" when who should enter Flora's fragrant temple but Joseph Bancroft himself, looking as black as three thunder-clouds rolled into one. The fact was, that from the windows of Mr. Buckley's private office he had watched the trio depart ; and taking note of a stray glance of admiration cast on blushful Barbara, he retired to his own \" den,\" to chafe more like a wild animal caged than the equable managing clerk of the Chester solicitor. From the moment that Barbara tore away from his embrace like a frightened fawn, he had tormented himself with jealous doubts, as all lovers do more or less. Had he mistaken the source of her tears and trembling ? Was his kiss a crime, that she should dart away without a word vouchsafed of hope or solace ? Had he watched her all these years to see her beguiled by that black-whiskered fellow's sentiment and poetry ? Curse the blundering engrosser, whose stupidity tied him to the office whilst his Barbara was being stolen from him ! The self-contained man, whose long pent-up feelings rushed"], [63, "THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. 51 Tvith the force of an opened sluice, paced his office floor with quick, impatient jerks and indistinct mutterings, to the intense astonishment of his junior, who, from a sort of cribbed-up closet beyond, watched his unprecedented movements through a slit in the green curtain covering the glass door, and rubbed his mis chievous hands in glee as though on the track of a secret. Presently Mr. Buckley was heard to enter his own office. Without waiting a summons he hurried to his principal. \" Well, Bancroft, what is it ? \" \" Those fresh mortgage-deeds Dutton promised this morning have not come in, sir. I sent Holmes round, but they will not be ready for two hours.\" \" Dear, dear ! that's awkward. I expect the mortgagee here in twenty minutes.\" \" Then you will not be going away again, sir, for some little time ; and \u2014 if \u2014 sir \u2014 \" \" Well, Bancroft, what is it?\" \" The flower-show, sir.\" \" Oh, to be sure ; I forgot. Be off with you at once ! \" Almost before the door closed on the retiring clerk, Mr. Buckley caught his button chin within his finger tips, and cogitated \u2014 \" Lucky I came back ! If Laura misses this chance she mayn't have another in a hurry. Not even Mr. Devereaux would have the assurance to pop the question with a third party to over hear ; and Barbara would never have the discretion to be tired, and take a seat whilst they kept on their promenade, not she ! \" Yet Barbara, weary of Mr. Devereaux's poetical flights, was contemplating that very unlikely feat when her eyes encountered in the doorway those of Joseph Bancroft. Instantaneously her face lighted up. She withdrew a pace from her companions, and instinctively raised her hand to the proffered arm of the new comer \u2014 an action so graceful in itself, so perfect in its recognition of his new claim, that the jealous cloud lifted, and his heart was lightened of a load. A little chit-chat, and the pairs separated by tacit consent. \" What was the matter, Joseph, when you came in ? Nothing wrong at the office ? \" asked Barbara, with a face as full of bloom as the rose before them, yet touched by a shade of concern. \" Nothing now, Barbara. You never answered my question last night, and I have been fool enough to be jealous of \" \" Oh, Joseph ! \" was all she said, but the artless interruption was a confession so complete, that he must have been a jealous fool indeed had he not been satisfied. That was a day of confessions."], [64, "52 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. Mr. Devereaux made a good use of opportunity when it came. He was captivated, but not so desperately in love as not to be master of his tongue and the situation. No time or place could have been better chosen. Without the inconvenience of \"a scene,\" he proposed, and was accepted. Then followed another confession to the papa, who was \" com pletely taken unaware:-,\" yet not so completely as to lose sight of his daughter's interest, or fail to suggest the settlement of his daughter's small property upon herself, seeing that the barrister had little beyond his profession to balance it. And so elated was Miss Laura with her triumphant success, that in the exuberance of her heart she made Polly, their dapper little black-eyed waiting maid, her confidante before she had well unloosed her bonnet-strings, and long before her sister (detained by an imperative confessor in the drawing-room) joined her, to become in turn a recipient of the delightful intelligence, and con gratulate her on her engagement. How was it that the two most in earnest, whose love, deep, pure, and true, had grown with their growth, to blossom suddenly as an aloe, should alone keep silent ? Was it that artificial fountains rise and sparkle in the sunshine, and are lost in a mist of spray ; while the deep well, which may refresh the parched wayfarer, and swell to a noble stream, oft lies hidden at its source amongst flowers and ferns, which owe to it their very life ? PART II. THE BUD. The barrister had returned to town an engaged man, and Miss Buckley had begun to discuss with Barbara the important question of trousseau, bespeaking her assistance in the plain-sewing, as a matter of course, when she received a shock which disturbed her equanimity for a week. \" Of course, you will be my bridesmaid, Barbara, and I shall see that you are dressed with taste for once in your life,\" said Laura complacently, as her crochet-hook darted in and out in the fabrication of a collar of that newly-revived work. \" Then is your wedding-day fixed ? \" put Barbara, in some surprise. \"I did not think, as our acquaintance with Mr. Devereaux is so recent, that you would be married so soon.\""], [65, "53 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. \" Who said I was going to be married ' so soon ? ' \" interro gated Laura, testily. \" What has the time of my marriage to do with the dress you should wear when you are my bridesmaid ? \" Barbara was unpicking a silk gown that had been her mother's, for conversion to her own use. She looked up composedly, though there was a faint flush on her cheeks \u2014 \"Well, not so much perhaps with my dress as with my being bridesmaid.\" Laura looked mystified. Barbara continued, without any visible pause, \" Joseph thought we might as well be married the same day.\" \"Joseph !\" gasped Laura, her hands and crochet dropping on her lap, her colour going and coming in quick transition : \" You, married ! Who would have th I never knew Jos \" an outburst of passionate tears finished the sentence. \" Why, Laura, what is the matter, dear ? \" said Barbara, in genuine surprise, as she walked over to the window where her sister sat, and laid a gentle hand upon her shoulder. It was shaken off with a pettish \" I think you might have taken me into your confidence before matters came to this pass. It is downright sly and deceitful of you ! \" \" Well, Laura,\" answered Barbara, quietly, \" I have attempted to tell you two or three times, but you have always been so full of your own love affairs, I had no chance to acquaint you with mine. I know Joseph told Mr. Devereaux before he went away.\" \" I hate deceit !\" was all the reply Laura vouchsafed, as she shook off her sister's hand, and her crochet-hook darted in and out the loops with a celerity born of vexation and displeasure. To think, after all the fascinations she had brought to bear on Joseph Bancroft, the senseless dolt had thrown himself away on her plain, unfashionable sister ! Not even the glorification of her engagement to the eligible Mr. Devereaux could compensate for Joseph Bancroft's selection of Barbara. Quite half-an-hour elapsed in very unsatisfactory musing. Lifting her head abruptly, she asked, \" Does father know?\" \" Of course !\" \"And what did he say?\" and still the crochet-hook manipu lated the thread with as much vehemence as dexterity. \" And what about your trousseau ? You will want one, I presume ?\" So snappishly was this said, that Barbara's responsive inter rogation was only natural. \" Why, Laura, dear, you surely are not angry because I am .going to marry Joseph Bancroft ?\""], [66, "54 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. There was a sudden toss of Laura's head. \" Angry, indeed I It does not matter to me whom you are going to marry ! But if father's so straitened for money as you wish to make me believe, I don't see how a second trousseau is to be provided at the same time, and I don't choose to go amongst Mr. Devereaux's London friends to disgrace him !\" \"Oh, Laura!\" answered Barbara, as if hurt by her sister's selfish speech. \" My wedding outfit will be a very simple affair. Of course every girl needs some preparation ; but as I am not going to live amongst strangers, I shall not draw very heavily upon father's purse ; and for my own part I think you ought to keep yours pretty nearly within your own resources ! Laura rose in indignation. \" Do you, indeed, Miss Clever ! That there may be more for yourself, I suppose ! It's a poor tale if I, who have cost so little to him all my life, cannot be sent from home befittingly on my marriage without paymg for it myself. Pray, were you instructed to preach economy to me?\" Poor Barbara ! Tears were fast gathering in her eyes, and her \" Certainly not \" came with less steadiness than ordinarily. Laura's offended dignity carried her from the drawing-room.. At the door she turned. \" I suppose Mr. Bancroft has thought proper to seek father's consent, reserved as he is ?\" Taking Barbara's dispirited nod as an assent, she put her foot on the upward flight of stairs, muttering as she ascended, \" I wish I had overheard him ! I wonder what was said, and when it was ! \" Perhaps the reader may also wish for enlightenment. The \" when \" was the day of Mr. Devereaux's departure ; the \" where \" Mr. Buckley's private office \u2014 a place, as Joseph Ban croft well knew, sacred from intrusion ; the \" what \" was pretty much as follows : \u2014 Mr. Buckley, his portly form expanding as it were with pleasure, sat rubbing his hands with satisfaction, and opening his heart to his confidential clerk. \" Capital match this, Bancroft.

I hope you will take as favourable a view of another projected alliance with your family, in which I am the suitor.\" \"You ! \" and Mr. Buckley pushed his chair back in his genuine amazement. Joseph Bancroft did not feel his ground quite so"], [67, "THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. 55 sure, but he said steadily (albeit he did not look the solicitor quite full in the face), \" Yes, sir. From the first day of my entrance here my admiration and love for Miss Barbara has grown and strengthened. I have been fortunate enough to win a return ; and we hope you will not withhold your sanction.\" Mr. Buckley held his button-chin pursed up in cogitation. He was a minute or two before he spoke. \" Barbara is only nineteen, Bancroft.\" \" Time will remedy that, sir.\" \" She has not a penny of fortune.\" \" I am aware of that. She is her own dower.\" \" Um ! And how do you think I am to manage, or the house get on without her ? \" \u2014 not said crossly. \" We thought, sir, that our marriage would not interfere with existing arrangements.\" \" Um ! You seem to have settled the matter pretty much between you.\" He rang his bell. \"Holmes, ask Miss Barbara to step down into my office a minute.\" Down came Barbara in a flutter, blushing rosy red. \" So, young lady, whilst I've been teaching this young man law, he tells me you've been teaching him love. And now he proposes to marry you, forsooth ! \" Joseph had brought her forward within his arm, and kept her hand assuringly in his. Her eyes seemed to trace the pattern in the floor-cloth. Mr. Buckley looked curiously at them both, his chin still in his fingers. ' ' Um ! \" said he ; \" and before you had been married six months I should not wonder if Bancroft did not want a partnership into the bargain.\" Joseph's face broke into a smile. \"Well, sir, I don't think ' Bancroft ' would be such a fool as to reject a good partnership if one were offered to him after his marriage.\" \" Then get along with you both, and settle the matter to your own liking upstairs. But first give your old father a kiss, Barbara, as a sort of ' thank you ! ' \" \" Capital day's work this ! \" quoth Mr. Buckley, when left to himself; \" both girls off my hands at once.\" (The solicitor was apt to reckon his chickens in advance.) \" Capital ! Nothing could be more satisfactory ; \" and again he rubbed his hands in glee. \" Barbara's young, to be sure; but better see her well settled early than hang on hand as Laura has done.

Hasn't been the worst lawyer, I can bear witness \u2014 and I keep my home intact. I'm glad he pitched on Barbara \u2014 she has all her mother's frugal ways, and will make much the best housekeeper ; and we shall have to retrench when Laura has left us \u2014 the extravagant young puss ! Between flounces and furbelows, fetes and flower shows, concerts and quadrille parties, if she has not quite worn a hole in my purse in the past two years, the lining certainly begins to look threadbare.\" He was standing at his office window, with one hand on his back and the other to his chin, as he thus ruminated. Perhaps the very nature of his reverie caused him to start as Miss Buckley, beaming and buoyant, tripped up the steps, followed by a draper's assistant bearing a huge parcel. \" What !\" he cried in amazement. \" Surely the girl has not being buying wedding garments before her devotee has well turned his back on the city, or time been given to ripen acquaint ance, and without one word to me on the subject. I must get Barbara to have a talk with her !\" Yes ! It was Laura, whose fulness of delight found its natural outlet over a draper's counter, and as she graciously explained to Barbara, \" You see, my dear, there will be so much plain-sewing for our two pair of hands to do, before we consult a dressmaker, that I thought I had best lose no time.\" But she had lost that little episode of the afternoon in which Barbara's future was decided, and the lovers had had the large drawing-room all to themselves in her absence ; and the tea-tray being already on the table, in her self-absorption she had failed to observe anything unwonted either in the clerk's presence or his manner towards Barbara. Hence her dismay at the revela tion after a lapse of days. And if Barbara had not been absolutely \" instructed \" to preach economy, she had had pretty intelligible hints. But neither hint nor instruction deterred Laura from rushing into expense. She was bent on making an impression on Mr. Devereaux's friends, and ignored consequences. He had talked of his people down in Sussex, and their old hall, and she had quite lost sight of the fact that he was the youngest son, with a couple of stout brothers between himself and his patrimony ; and of a barrister's life in chambers she knew nothing. She had heard her father say, \" Devereaux must be making money fast.\" She had never asked herself how many outlets he had for its expenditure. She knew nothing of opera tickets, oyster- suppers, cigars-, champagne, et iioc genus omne,"], [69, "THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. 57 with which the really hard-working barrister solaced himself between terms. She knew nothing of Martin Devereaux's embarrassments, nor the dreadful \" pull-up \" he had felt when her father proposed to settle upon her all which her aunt had not previously tied down, and how honour and not overweening affection had kept him from drawing back. His letters came regularly (much of his love-making was culled from the elder poets), and now and then he found his way to Chester. There was no direct rail at the time, and travelling was both more tedious and costly than now, or she might have seen him more frequently. Mr. Buckley pressed him to spend Christmas with them, but he excused himself on the plea that \" his people would expect him at the hall,\" and that his visit home might in a great measure determine the date of his marriage. He did not say how far his marriage depended on that visit, although he might have done, since its object was such a replenishing of his exchequer as would enable him to furnish a house and otherwise prepare to \" settle down.\" It was solely this prospect of settling down which induced his eldest brother to hand \u00a3800 over to him, with the proviso that Martin should \" not trouble him again, but live within his means henceforth.\" Seeing that it was the first favour Martin Devereaux had sought from his brother since the law of primogeniture set Everard in the seat of their ancestors, and sent himself and two others out into the world to make their way with little beyond their endow- ments \u2014 Roland in the army, Neville in the church \u2014 the admoni- tion chafed him, and he was three parts inclined to tear up the cheque, and fling it back. His forensic experience had taught him to keep impulse in the background when interest was at stake, and to think rapidly ; so thinking twice, he pocketed the affront as he would have pocketed a fee. He was a man of honour, and his first care on returning to town was to free himself from the shackles of debt. His next was to select and send to his fiancee several articles of brilliant jewellery, which threw her into ecstacies, and not her alone, but Polly, their dapper Welsh maid, whom she had installed as confidante when Barbara was voted ineligible on account of her own engagement. \" It's no use talking to Barbara, now ; our interests are sure to clash,\" she argued with herself. And when her half-sister gave her opinion, \"Yes ! I admire the jewels ; they .are brilliant and elegant \u2014 those bracelets particularly so ; but"], [70, "58 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. unless Mr. Devereaux be a man of fortune, apart from his profession, they will be far too costly for his wife to wear \" \u2014 she set the observation down to sheer envy. In a very short time the trinkets were followed by a letter to say that he had taken a house in Canonbury Square, and should have possession at Lady-day ; and hoped that Laura would approve his choice. Her answer was a frank one; she \" knew nothing of London, and had entire reliance on his judgment ;\" but there was a post script \u2014 \" You know, if we find that we do not like it we can re move,\" and the postscript rather disturbed his equanimity. He was taking the house on lease. He was in Chester before Lady-day ; was as attentive as Miss Buckley could wish ; and during the few days of his visit, not withstanding the March winds, she made the most of her time, traversing Eastgate Street and the Rows, in most bewildering toilettes, either to make purchases or to call upon friends, and exhibit her \" catch \" to less fortunate demoiselles. He was scarcely conscious how much he was being paraded. He only felt that she was proud of him ; and she, being a fine handsome woman, elegant in carriage and attire, of unexception able manner before the world, he was proud of her and of being her cavalier. During this visit he proposed that they should be married before Trinity Term, and he went back to furnish the house in Canonbury Square for her reception, with no very clear ideas on the latter subject. And so he turned the house over to an upholsterer, with a suggestion here and there of his own. The tradesman had taste, and between carpets, damask, glass, gilding, and polished woods, contrived to convey the idea of easy, not to say affluent, circumstances, and refined pro clivities. But four hundred pounds melted in the process, and Martin began to look upon marriage as rather an expensive luxury. However, he consoled himself with the reflection, \"After all, it's only once in a man's lifetime ; chairs and tables don't wear away.\" Meantime Laura was in her glory. Silks and satins, feathers and lace, muslin and linen, filled every room of the house ; and, sewing-machines being unknown, Polly's younger sister, Jenny Owen, was sent for from Wrexham, to assist in such stitching as lay beyond the milliner's province. Barbara, too, was hard at work. She was deft with her scissors, and to her fell the wearisome task of cutting-out. She was alone in the back parlour, converted into a work-"], [71, "59 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. room, busy cutting away at a piece of fine linen, and singing cheerily all the time, with April sunshine on her head. Joseph came behind her ; he had been watching her from the doorway some time. \"Barbara, dearest, do you know any cause or impediment why we should not be married at the same time as Laura and Devereaux ? \" and he turned up her face to his to employ a lover's persuasion. \" Oh, Joseph, dear, I don't see how it is possible. I think we must wait until autumn. There is so much yet to be done for Laura. I have scarcely had time to set a stitch for myself.\" \" And you don't need it,\" he answered promptly. \" Dress cannot make my Barbara dearer to me than she is ; she is so dear that I am not disposed to wait on so insufficient a plea. Besides \" (and his tone changed), \" Laura has no right to tax you to feed her own extravagant love of display. You have been knitting and sewing for her for months. I should think she meant to stock a warehouse. Your father cannot have any notion what the cost will be.\" \" Well, Joseph, I heard him grumbling about the bills which came in at Christmas for materials, and protesting he would not pay them ; but I think he has done ; and she goes on ordering. But, to tell you the truth, I am afraid to ask for anything for myself, she is running him so dreadfully into debt. Her own money is spent in mere nick-nacks.\" \" And, Barbara, dear, that is not the worst. Men cannot shut their eyes to what goes on around them. I have noticed Polly wearing cast-off finery unfit for a servant-maid. If Laura infects that simple country girl with her notions of folly and vanity, there is no knowing where it may end. I, for one, shall be glad when she has gone from amongst us !\" Could Laura, who opened the door as he concluded, have heard his comment, what a rebuke it would have been to her! \" Oh, are you here, Joseph?\" she ejaculated, with her hand on the handle of the door. \" Barbara, I wish you would come into the drawing-room. I cannot persuade father to have it re-furnished for our wedding ; I am sure it needs it \u2014 the dingy hole !\" It was not a dingy hole. The furniture was good, but of the solid kind in vogue when Jonathan Buckley had married his first wife. The flowers on the drab-grounded Brussels carpet had lost their pristine hues ; the fringe and lace on the crimson moreen curtains might have been a brighter gold ; the picture"], [72, "60 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. frames had contracted a little tarnish ; but the sun streamed in through three windows, gleamed on bright furniture, fire-irons, and chimney glass, and, though it pryed into all the corners, found no dust lurking there ; and it is dust, dust never thoroughly removed, which makes rooms dingy. Jonathan Buckley had put his foot down at last. He would not re-furnish to please her. \"If this room be not good enough to receive your Aunt Chippendale's friends, and Mr. Devereaux's friends, let them stay away. Your wedding is likely to cost me more than I can afford, as it is. There has been nothing but expense since you came back home ! \" He was not usually so outspoken, and the explosion cost him an effort. Mr. Bancroft had a word to say. \" Mr. Buckley, if I took Barbara to a house of my own, I should have to furnish that entirely. Here is a house ready furnished for us ; but I have all along been desirous to replace carpets and hangings in this room at least, and to resit one apartment entirely as our own on our marriage, as a matter of common right if not of sentiment. There should be something fresh around us to mark a new epoch outwardly.\" \" Um !\" murmured Mr. Buckley, holding his chin. \" There is something in that. I forgot there were going to be young married folk to begin life in the old rooms.\" \"Yes, sir; but Barbara desires to defer our marriage until autumn, the extensive preparations of Miss Buckley not leaving her time to make her own simple ones until that young lady be disposed of.\" (He could be sarcastic when he liked, could immobile Mr. Bancroft.) \"And therefore the question arises whether I should send upholsterers in to prepare for Miss Buckley's bridal, or for our Barbara's, or for both.\" Laura pattered her foot, Barbara had put her pretty hand before his mouth, but he had only kissed and removed it into safe keeping until he concluded. He had long seen Barbara subordinated to her sister, and dominated over as a sort of useful companion, and longed to snap the bonds which Barbara hardly saw. His indignation culminated when he found that even in the important step of marriage Miss Laura was coolly to set aside her half-sister. He made good use of the opportunity Laura had created ; and the question, once raised, had to be fully discussed then and there, in spite of Laura's pattering feet and tongue, or Barbara's pleading eyes. Mr. Buckley opened Ms eyes to find that his eldest daughter"], [73, "THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. 61 had not only appropriated the whole of the drapery goods with which the house overflowed, but also the services of Barbara and Jenny, and the placable man was wrathful in proportion. But after all Barbara won the day. Mr. Buckley and Joseph maintained that it was best to celebrate both bridals at once, as a saving of cost and trouble. She protested she should be overfaced by a crowd of strangers, and would rather be bridesmaid to Laura, and then, whenever her father and Joseph thought proper afterwards, be married herself quietly without any fuss or display. And she thought it would look invidious to smarten up their house aster her sister had left it, whosoever paid the paperer and upholsterer. Her appealing, \" Now, Joseph, please,\" was not heard by Laura, who had swept from the room in stately indignation ; but he and the father heard it, and registered it in their hearts. And so, on a bright morning in the middle of May, Laura's lady friends assembled round the bride in a newly-painted and furnished bed-chamber ; and the bride's white satin dress and slippers swept over new carpets and oil-cloths, and the white book-muslins of her two bridesmaids set her off most effectually. She had elected to be married in a veil, an aspiration beyond the middle-class' of the time ; and a veil she wore, of richly-figured French blonde, as Jonathan Buckley remembered with a sigh for many a month afterwards. There was no doubt she made a charming bride, and Martin Devereaux thought he had won a prize in life's lottery ; as so many of Miss Chippendale's friends assured him after the luxurious wedding breakfast, whilst the bride was changing her attire for travelling robes, scarcely less costly than those in which she had stood at the altar. She wore a purple velvet mantelet over a dress of rich dove-coloured satin, and a white lace bonnet, where orange blossoms and jessamine lurked under the brim. Some natural pangs she felt, no doubt, on leaving home and friends for an untried world, but she was sanguine and hopeful of a brilliant future, and put Chester behind her as a thing of the past. Polly Owen, whom she had persuaded to accept service with her in London, was far more distressed at quitting her sister Jenny, and her old master and mistress. As if some prevision of evil hung about her, she clung to Jenny, and not without many a sobbing \" God pless you ! \" could she tear herself away. But she only went to fresh and finer service \u2014 not to marriage : that made all the difference, mayhap !"], [74, "\u25a0\u25a062 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. PART HI. THE BLOSSOM. The last wedding-guest was bowed out, the last slice of bride's cake had been tied up and despatched with the last pair of silver edged wedding cards, and the carrier's cart stood at the door to receive Mrs. Martin Devereaux's surplus luggage ; but it was not until the last box had been hoisted in, and the lumbering vehicle rolled off with a load of feminine gear that Mr. Buckley fairly drew his breath in a long-drawn sigh of relief. He went into his office rubbing his hands in self- congratulation. \" Well, that's the last of it ! Thank goodness it's all over and done with ! Laura may be said to be fairly off my hands now ! \" was his exclamation, as he threw himself into his easy chair with the limp abandon of reaction after excitement is withdrawn. \" Over and done with ? \" Before the last crumb of wedding cake had been nibbled by adventurous mice he changed his note. Bills came dropping in one after another ; from the milliner for the combinations of taste and material, which, under the name of bonnets, were destined to crown Mrs. Martin Devereaux ; from the draper for silks and satins, muslin and tarlatan, velvet and cashmere, barege and print, ribbons and lace ; from the dressmaker for the conversion of materials into dresses for the morning, dresses for the evening, for outdoor w*ear and for indoor wear, and for trimmings ad libitum ; from the hosier for gloves and hose ; from the shoemaker for slippers of satin, and kid boots for summer, and boots for the winter ; and having already paid a substantial bill for the plainer materials in linen, woollen, and cotton, he was fairly in a position to calculate the cost of a fine lady from top to toe. It was anything but a satisfactory estimate to him. Bending under the weight of the last straw, he betook himself to Barbara, busied with her sewing in the drawing-room. \" Look, child ; here's another of those confounded long bills Laura has been running up. If she had stayed at home much longer she would have driven me into the bankruptcy court. I had quite enough of it in her mother's days. She might have been furnishing the wives of a regiment.\" \" Well, papa, I suppose she did not wish to be under the necessity of drawing upon her husband's purse for dress at the outset.\" \" I wish she had thought a little more of mine. But a woman with an ample income of her own has no right to draw upon her"], [75, "THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. 63 husband's purse, or her father's either, for finery and frippery. And that reminds me I came upstairs to ask you, Barbara, what Laura did with her money ? The \u00a340 a year she had from her aunt ought to have served her for dress and pocket money, but it never did. You never cost me half the sum ! What did she do with it ? \" and he sat down with the bill in his hand, leaning forward, his arms on his knees. \" I'm sure I can hardly tell. A good deal went in little things \u2014 gloves, lace, ribbons, flowers, handkerchiefs, perfumery, and such small matters ; and then she threw her things away before they were half worn out.\" \" Well, my dear,\" said he, after apause, his chin in his fingers, \"I'm downright sorry for it ; but with these heavy bills to meet I do not see how I can afford a fresh outlay on your account ; and I'm afraid Joseph will have to wait a little longer for you, my girl, all through your sister's selfish extravagance.\" But Joseph was not disposed to wait much longer. He had wakened up considerably, had that seemingly apathetic individual. \" Do you think I want to marry a clothes-chest ?\" questioned he of Mr. BucMey. \" Give me Barbara, trousseau or no trousseau. What has sufficed for Barbara Buckley will suffice for Barbara Bancroft, or I mistake her altogether. It shall be my care that she lacks nothing as my wife. And let me express my opinion, sir, that an enormous outfit is an enormous blunder on the part of a bride. Let her carry with her garments to last for years \u2014 the early and fond years of married life \u2014 and she will find that, when her worn-out wardrobe needs replenishing, her husband will in all probability resent the unaccustomed drain on his purse, not at all grateful for the anti-nuptial provision which had spared it so long.\" \" Um ! You might be a widower instead of a bachelor, you put the case so clearly,\" was Jonathan BucMey's response. \"That was exactly how I felt, I do believe, and I have twice gone through the experience.\" So there was a quiet unpretentious wedding at St. Mary's Church, when the summer leaves began to change colour ; and the bride, in her white muslin dress and white drawn silk bonnet, was not one whit less charming than the bride who had swept up the aisle in sheeny satin, and hid her blushes under a costly veil of French blonde. Miss Dutton, the law-stationer's daughter, was the sole brides maid ; a few old friends gathered around them, and drank their health and happiness in the old home on the Walls ; and then Joseph Bancroft bore her away, with but small impedimenta, to"], [76, "64 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. spend the honeymoon in his own old home in the depths of Delamere Forest, where his family were yeomen -farmers, and where her reception was as hearty as it was homely. Mrs. Devereaux, who had come all the way from London to attend the ceremony, and ah her superb toilettes and matronly importance, was \" thorougMy disgusted with the whole affair, it was so shabby ! \" But her connubial confidence only elicited a whistle in response, which annoyed her extremely. \" I wish you would not whistle when I speak to you, Martin,\" she said, testily. \" Anyone w*ould think you would have been satisfied with just such another hum-drum wedding !\" \" Well, my dear,\" drawled he, drawing the breast-pin from his embroidered satin scarf, \" I don't think the imposing display we made added one joy to our honeymoon, and I know it added very considerably to your father's anxieties.\" \" Pooh ! Nonsense! \" \" Pooh ! Nonsense ! if you like, my dear ; but he told me in confidence to-day that the expense of our wedding had delayed Barbara's, and that but for Bancroft's impatience he should have postponed it until next spring, in order that one daughter should not suffer for the undue equipment of the other.\" \"Undue equipment, indeed ! I had cost him nothing for eighteen or nineteen years. I am sure he had no right to complain.

Why do you not answer properly? \" \" My dear, I have no desire to impugn your good taste, and my pocket did not suffer ; but Everard certainly did remark that your dress would have better suited his wife than mine ! \" From which observation it is apparent that Martin Devereaux had taken his bride to the old Hall, in Sussex, to introduce her to the heads of the family, in the persons of Everard and his wife, a member of an ancient county family, and that the elder Devereaux had not altogether endorsed the choice of his younger brother. The fact was, the solicitor's daughter had attempted to outshine the baronet's daughter, unmindful of their different positions ; and having a better idea of his brother's finances than Laura herself, over a cigar in the seclusion of the smoking-room, Everard had given Martin a hint to \" clip his bride's feathers a bit, or so fine a bird might fly away with money faster than he could make it.\""], [77, "65 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. The house in Canonbury Square, fresh from the hands of the upholsterer, had appeared to Laura's provincial eyes \" a thing of beauty,\" destined to be \" a joy for ever.\" The eye, accustomed to heavy moreen curtains, and black hair-seated mahogany chaira and sofas, rested with pleasure on bright green damask and walnut wood, and on the new shape of the leather-covered chairs of their dining-room, on lustres and gasaliers. \" Oh, Martin, dear, how beautiful ! What exquisite taste ! It is a perfect paradise ! What a magnificent looking-glass ! What a superb vase ! \" were her ejaculations as she made the tour of her new residence, hanging on her husband's arm, her bright eyes sparkling with pleasure, and having a reflex of satisfaction in his. She, however, made but a cursory survey of the kitchens, and had but a bare word of recognition for Emma, the new cook, who straightway set her down as a \" proud madam.\" \" Oh, Martin, how good you have been ! We shall be so happy,\" she cried, putting up her lips to meet his on their return to the gas-lighted drawing-room. \" I hope so, my love, and I am delighted to have been so successful in my efforts to please you,\" said he. \"I was most anxious to have a comfortable home,\" and he drew her to his side on a soft settee, whilst supper was in course of preparation. \" Comfortable ! Oh, everything is charming ! And what delightful parties we can give !\" I've a notion his clasp relaxed somewhat. However, he did not altogether favour quiet wedded bliss himself, and so he simply replied, \"We must be content with each other's company for a while, Laura dear. Mine are mostly bachelor friends ; we must wait until other friends gather round us before we give parties.\" Wedding-cards had, however, been sent to Mr. Devereaux's select associates, those who had families in town, and soon Mrs. Martin Devereaux had a visiting list, of which she availed herself to the full. With her own home, however, she was soon disenchanted. Her visit to Devereaux Hall did that. That glimpse of unattain able magnificence, of suites of spacious apartments filled with the accumulations of centuries, made her own handsomely-fitted house in Canonbury dwarf in comparison. Then many of Martin's friends lived at the West-End, and Mrs. Martin Devereaux would. fain have transported herself and their possessions to the West also. But the hint of the eldest brother had not been lost on the youngest, and he pleaded the lease when she suggested migration. Meanwhile they lived quite to the extent of their income. F"], [78, "66 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. Laura's fortune (not altogether three thousand pounds, and the product under ninety pounds per annum) being settled on herself, she assumed a right to dispose of it ; and certainly had it been thrice as much she would have found it all too little. Nevertheless, as she dressed well, looked well, acquitted herself well in dining-room or drawing-room, could sing and play with taste, there were not wanting those who openly envied Devereaux his \" charming young wife,\" and congratulated him on the possession of so magnificent a creature ; and he took her to theatre, concert, or exhibition, proud of the admiration she excited. But to maintain the state they had inaugurated he had to devote himself assiduously to his profession, and even then, before the second year of their married life, found it necessary to insist on a curtailment of expenditure, even though a baby had been added to the establishment. She had taken Polly with her as housemaid ; but on the advent of the little stranger, Polly, who was fast losing her native simplicity, was promoted to the dignity of nurse, as being more capable and trustworthy than the general run of town nursemaids, if Punch and Mrs. Devereaux's lady friends were to be credited. And now Polly, a pretty dapper maiden, was no longer confined to the kitchen and the society of cook. When her mistress visited her friend, Mrs. Markham, the wife of a solicitor in Bedford Square, or Mrs. Hobson, the editor's wife in Bamsbury, Polly, in her best array, followed with the baby-boy, as fine as embroidery, braid, and cashmere could make him ; and there being at both houses nurseries and nursemaids, she speedily became initiated into all the mysteries of the craft. It was like wise part of her duty to peregrinate the Square and its planted enclosure with little Roland (whose baptism had been a grand affair | for a'daily airing, and then there was no mistress to watch her footsteps, or to know what associates she formed beyond the limited range of the drawing-room windows. For a long time she was shy of strangers, and letters from Wrexham, wherein a good mother warned her against the temp tations of a great city, kept her within the straight path. Little Roland had a sister, Jessica, before any marked change was visible in Polly. During her first year of London service she had sent money home to her mother, the second year she spent all her wages on her dress, the third she found her stipend insufficient and craved for an advance. \" It was not possible to dress herself respectably on \u00a310 a-year.\" -_*->\u2022\u25a0. - L,, .^"], [79, "THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. 67 She did not take into account the cast-off flowers, ribbons, and aprons, or even the good silk dress, which (having been stained with coffee) her mistress told her to get dyed and keep for her own wear. Perhaps it was that very gift which made her wages insufficient, since, finding the wear of silk not only unforbidden but encouraged, she longed to have a spic-and-span new one, to parade on Sundays and holidays. The coveted garment came into her possession at a time when Captain Devereaux (whose regiment was stationed in Dublin) was spending a somewhat long leave with his relatives, having with him an Irish soldier-servant, who was very much smitten with Polly. Gossip is confined to no one region, and soon it reached Mrs. Devereaux's ears that Canonbury Square was outraged by the perambulation therein of a nurse-maid in a shot-silk dress, blue satin bonnet, and black satin polonaise of the newest fashion. Mrs. Devereaux watched to catch the culprit, and herself opened the door for Polly .on her return from her next \" Sunday out.\" Eyeing the damsel from head to foot and from foot to head, she bade her follow into the parlour, where she seated herself on a crimson lounge, still keeping a steadfast eye on the imitative dressy little Welshwoman, who quailed beneath her searching glance. \" Can that be the Polly Owen I brought with me from Chester four years ago ? \" she asked with a sneer ; \" the girl who had not so much as a pink bow to brighten up her plain brown stuff' dress, until I gave her one ?\" Polly looked at the carpet, but never answered a syllable. Perhaps the reminiscence troubled her, \" Times have changed with you since then, I should think!\" continued Mrs. Devereaux, in the same dry tone. \"Pray how much did that dress and mantle cost?\" \" I do not know, ma'am,\" faltered Polly, without raising her eyes. \" Not know ! \" exclaimed Mrs. Devereaux, expanding hers in amazement. \" Then pray, madam, w-here did you get them? \" Polly hesitated, big drops in her eyes being ready to fall. \" Why do you not answer ? If you have come by them honestly you have no need to hesitate.\" Honestly ! Polly knew of but one meaning to the word, and the suspicion of theft dried her tears. \"My sweetheart gave them to me;\" and she looked her questioner in the face \u2014 and not shyly."], [80, "68 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. \" Your \u2014 sweetheart \u2014 gave \u2014 you \u2014 that \u2014 lutestring \u2014 dress \u2014 and \u2014 satin \u2014 polonaise ? \" and Mrs. Devereaux drew out her words to emphasize her wonder. \" And, pray, where did Mike get his money from ? \" \" I never asked him, ma'am ; put he gets plenty given him pesides what the Captain gives him.\" Mrs. Devereaux's brow knitted doubtfully. \" I shall question the Captain,\" said she, adding: \" But are you not conscious it is improper for young girls to accept expensive presents from their sweethearts ?\" \" Well, ma'am, young ladies take presents from their lovers, as you must know, ma'am,\" and Polly's eyes settled on a fine cameo brooch the lady wore ; \" and I thought there could pe no harm, look you ! \" Mrs. Devereaux flushed. She recalled the exhibition of jewellery to Polly when Mr. Devereaux sent his gifts to her. \" In any case, Polly, you will have to dress differently if you remain in my service. Silks and satins are not for domestie servants. Go and take your peacock's feathers off, and keep your fine plumage until you are married, if you ever mean to be.\" Thus dismissed, Polly went off in dudgeon ; and Mrs. Devereaux, not more amiable for the rebuff, turning to the fire, waited, book in hand, the return of Martin and the Captain from Islington Church. She followed the fingers of the bronze timepiece from nine to half-past, and on to ten, and then, to relieve her impatience, mounted the stairs, where bright brass rods stood out in relief against the fawn-and-erimson Brussels carpeting, to the nursery on an upper floor. Roland was fast asleep in his little cane-and mahogany cot, under a canopy of snowy dimity edged with daisy fringe; but Jessica, whose incipient double-teeth troubled her, was inclined to be fractious. It pleased Mrs. Devereaux to attribute the infant's fretfulness to bad nursing, consequent on Polly's ill-humour at being taken to task ; and her motherliness being touched by the babe's complain ing restlessness, she took it in her own lap. She had on a rich striped lutestring, whereon stripes of shaded ruby alternated with black, with two deep flounces, and long pointed waist with a ruby cord and chenille tassels as a girdle ; and very magnificent she looked. To divert baby-Jessica's attention from her brooch, which had a pin likely to scratch, she dangled one of these chenille tassels before the child, who laughed and tried to catch the soft, rich, pendulous plaything with its fat, velvety hands. Whilst thus engaged, her husband's knock at the hall door"], [81, "THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. 69 \u2022caused her to jump up, and in her eagerness to question the Captain respecting Mike, she hurried from the room with night coated Jessica in her arms. The child must have loosened the tie of the girdle, one end of which trailed after her, the other being secured at the waist. As the excited lady began to descend the lower flight of stairs, the cord or the tassel caught and entangled in a stair-rod. There was a sharp jerk, the cord gave way, Mrs. Devereaux was precipitated headlong with a shriek, and the loosely-held infant was sent flying from her arms, just as the door was opened to admit Martin, without his brother. There were large thick bearskin mats at the foot of the stairs, and at the room doors, yet not the thickest of rugs could do more than break such a fall. \" Laura, my love, are you injured ? Can you not speak to me ? \" cried the agitated husband, as he knelt on the oil-cloth and raised his wife's head with unwonted tenderness \u2014 all the love he had ever felt for her concentrated into a focus by that untoward accident. \" Run for a doctor ! The one in the Square ! \" he called out hastily, his wife's eyelids remaining closed, and her breath catching in gasps. Polly, who, hearing the shriek, had rushed downstairs, leapt over the prostrate form, and darted from the house without wait, ing for shawl or bonnet. In Mrs. Devereaux lying there insensible she forgot the rebuke administered two hours before, and she literally seemed to fly. The noise had brought Mike Sullivan, Captain Devereaux's servant, up from the kitchen, and with his help the unfortunate lady was removed to a couch in the parlour, where her husband hung over her in much distress when Polly came back with the doctor after a very brief absence. \" My child ! Where is my child ! \" was the mother's first cry on her revival. \" Pless her pretty heart ! she's quite safe. Look you ! not a pone proken, thank Got.\" The child, thrown forward with the jerk, had flown as it were over balusters, and through the air, to alight on the bearskin at the parlour door, whence it was lifted by the housemaid, to all appearance unharmed, and quieter than might have been expected. The next day there was another baby girl in the house, who had come quite two months too soon ; and that corner of the square had its roadway laid with straw, to deaden the sound of"], [82, "70 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. passing vehicles, for four or five weeks, during which Laura Devereaux hovered on the confines of eternity. Such was her peril, that Barbara \u2014 leaving her little Jonathan, a sturdy fellow nearly two years and a half old, to the care of his grandfather and Jenny \u2014 travelled up to London, not only to take charge of her, but of house and family. Martin Devereaux having written to Joseph \u2014 \"I have three or four important cases on. hand requiring my undivided attention, and between nurse, servants, children, and anxiety for my sick wife, I am sc distracted I fear I shall make a mull of my briefs, so for Heaven's sake ask your good Barbara to come and watch over her sister, or we may lose her.\" There was a pressure of business in Buckley and Bancroft's office at the time, but Joseph would not suffer his cherished wife to travel so far alone, and he ran up with her ; returning the next day, much to the disgust of Holmes, who had looked forward to at least a week of easy indulgence, and undisturbed flirtation with vigilantly-guarded Jenny, now a staid little handmaiden of eighteen. The household in Canonbury Square was very different from the one on Chester's ancient Wall, and Barbara Bancroft could not readily reconcile the conflicting elements of profusion and penuriousness which were around her. All that tended to luxurious appearance was lavish ; that on which comfort depended was found wanting; soft cushions, wool-work, statuettes, vases, and bijouterie crowded the drawing-room ; the kitchen lacked appliances for daily and common use. No fitting saucepan and strainer could be found for the preparation of gruel ; but the cook found a saucy tongue to resent intrusion on her domain. \" What business have ladies in kitchens, I should like to know ? My own mistress never interferes with me ! As if I did not know how* to make gruel, indeed !\" But Barbara, who was no stranger to her own kitchen, and who knew there were right and wrong ways of making even a cup of gruel, and who did not think either cook or nurse dainty enough to cater for an invalid, pursued her own course composedly, and long before Mrs. Devereaux was able to leave her room, had done much to check waste, and promote cleanliness and. order below* stairs. She had done more. Her very presence had acted as a timely check on Polly Owen. The offending garments were carefully kept in the background ; but habit had become second nature, and Barbara saw a change in the girl which she knew old Mrs. Owen, the farmer's wife, would have been sorry to see."], [83, "71 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. In bhe nursery, whither she had been drawn by the fretfulness of Jessica, Mrs. Bancroft took occasion to lay before Polly the possible consequences of an overweening love of finery to one who had to earn her living in domestic service ; spoke of Polly's mother, and her trouble because her daughter wrote so seldom and unsatisfactorily, and on that mother's behalf questioned her respecting the sweetheart of whom she had written home. Polly hesitated, began to unbutton Master Roland's velvet pelisse, and kept her face out of sight ; but she muttered some thing which sounded like \" Mike, the Captain's servant, does pe pothering me, ma'am, put I tell him I don't want him, look you ! I can do petter than Mike, pless you ! \" \" I should hope you would do better than marry a soldier, Polly ; but I heard you had accepted presents from him, and no young woman should take gifts from a young man she does not mean to have.\" Whereupon, Polly grew confused, and in her efforts to excul pate herself so blundered and blushed that Barbara felt there was something behind, and afterwards kept a watchful eye upon her. Soon it dawned upon her comprehension that Polly had two strings to her bow. The Captain's servant in the kitchen who was genuine in his love for her, and who served as a blind for the Captain himself, who seemed to be perpetually meeting the pretty nurse-maid in the hall or on the staircase, or even found his way into the nursery under pretence of taking toys to his little namesake. This troubled single-minded Barbara Bancroft much. Another talk with Polly elicited that Captain Devereaux, and not Mike, had given her the silk dress and satin mantle ; and she wrought upon the girl to promise henceforth to avoid so dangerous a \" friend.\" Not satisfied with that, she took the Captain himself to task, and, quiet as she was, she made him so ashamed of himself that he returned to his regiment, or, at all events, left Canonbury Square long before his leave of absence expired ; and, of course, Mike went with him ; so Polly lost both of her admirers at once. Barbara said nothing of this to either her brother-in-law or Laura, not caring to disturb either, nor indeed to provoke the latter to dismiss her nursemaid peremptorily without a character. The former, who was seldom at home, seemed full of thought and anxiety. The latter, on whom convalescence was dawning, seemed more engrossed in the selection of becoming caps and dressing-gowns in which to receive her doctor, and in the new baby's robes, than in any care for the welfare of those about her."], [84, "72 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. Indeed, when she was able to be removed downstairs, and Barbara called her attention to little Jessica, who appeared less active, and more fretful than a healthy child should be, she dis missed the subject with an impatient \" Oh, Jess always was irritable ; it was that child's restlessness caused my accident ! \" The littered straw had been trodden into mire, and finally carted away ; Mrs. Markham, and other stylish friends, began to call on the restored lady, who sat amongst cushions, in her drawing-room to receive them, arrayed in a tasteful pink cash mere loose robe ; and then Barbara thought it was time to return to her own dear ones in Chester. \" I am glad you are coming home, Barbara, dear ; we have been almost lost without you ! \" was the exclamation of her husband as she rushed to meet him in the hall, when he came to fetch her, and rested her head on his breast, as if there was her home ; \"Little Johnny does nothing but ask, ' When will mamma turn back ? ' \" \" You will not surely take Barbara back until she has seen something of London ; she has been nowhere but in a sick room,\" said Mrs. Devereaux, with unwonted thought for her attentive sister. \"Oh! we can cram a good deal of sight-seeing into three or four days ; I cannot spare more,\" answered Mr. Bancroft. \" I hope you will not take her back without a few town-made dresses and bonnets. I only wish I was able to go shopping ; you should see what a difference I would make in your un fashionable wife, Joseph.\" \" Is she unfashionable?\" asked Joseph. \"I never found it out. Perhaps I am unfashionable, too ; for to my mind she is perfection \u2014 in dress as in all things else.\" \" True loveliness needs not the foreign aid of ornament ; but is when unadorned adorned the most,\" chimed in Mr. Devereaux. \" I see nothing wanting in your sister's attire, Mrs. Devereaux. A plain garment best becometh a beautiful woman,\" and a half sigh pointed his observation. \" Pooh ! You men have no taste !\" remarked Laura, and the topic changed. Years passed. Jenny w*as married to Holmes. Two more olive branches grew up round the nursery table in Canonbury Square. Little Johnny Bancroft, in jacket and trousers, carried himself and his school books to an academy in Watergate Street, still an only child, whom his grandfather did his best to spoil. Mr. Buckley had recovered from the temporary difficulties occasioned by extravagance, and carried his portly person to the"], [85, "73 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. Royal Hotel for an hour every evening. The firm was flourishing, and the home harmonious. The same could scarcely be said for the Devereaux's home. The barrister's practice had grown rapidly ; but so had his family ; and each addition made fresh inroads on his purse, Mrs. Devereaux deeming it an absolute duty to keep up an appearance befitting her husband's position. Ten years elapsed before Barbara again visited the Devereauxs. But in the interim she heard two distressing items of intelligence. Jessica had to wear a high boot, one limb was shorter than the other; she was supposed to have injured her hip when jerked from her mother's arms years before. And Mrs. Devereaux had indignantly dismissed her Welsh nursemaid for impertinently copying her own dress, and endeavouring to inveigle Captain Devereaux into an unworthy connection ! PART IV. THE FRUIT. Barbara's errand to London was one of mercy. A few weeks previously a dissipated tawdry woman had accosted a soldier in the Strand after dusk. He had his head bent down at the time ; sifting it, as he shook off her hand, he staggered back with the one word, \" Polly !\" in a stupor of blank amaze ment. \" Mike !\" screamed the woman at the pitch of her voice, and turning, fled, her flimsy shawl floating behind her. Recovering himself, he followed ; but she, rounding the corner to Waterloo Bridge, kept well in advance, and apparently without pause for thought, mounted the parapet of the bridge and flung herself head foremost into the river. \" For the love of God, Polly, stop ! \" he had called to her, but it was too late. \"Now, may the blessed St. Peether have marcy upon our sowls ! I cannot let the poor crathur drown!\" he exclaimed, and before a spectator could interpose he had dived after her. It was evening, and the tide was running out ; but there was just light enough for him to see an arm flung up as she rose to the surface, and swimming swiftly towards her he clutched her from behind ; her shawl gave way, and she was going ; again he caught at her head-dress, and the bonnet strings broke. She"], [86, "74 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. was almost gone, but he grasped her long black hair, and held her fast, and bore her up before him towards a wherry which had put out from the quay side, and with the waterman's help succeeded in bringing her to shore. A crowd had gathered, with policemen in their midst. She was carried to a public-house at hand, and means taken to restore consciousness, the policemen keeping strict guard over her. There were one or two gentlemen in the crowd who expressed their admiration of Mike's exploit, and would have pressed both money and drink on the brave soldier ; but save a single glass of whiskey, \"just to kape out the cowld, sirr,\" neither money nor liqour would Mike touch. The woman before them had been aU the world to him ten years before. He could not take money for saving her wretched life now, though her disappearance then had made his own life a burthen to him. As she came to herself and looked round the soldier would fain have slunk from the room unrecognised, but she saw him, and again the one word, \"Mike,\" escaped her lips. And now the police barred his egress. They took possession of the woman for attempted suicide, and of him to compel the evidence he seemed unwilling to render. From the police-station an officer was sent along with him to Knightsbridge Barracks to provide for his appearance before the magistrates the next morning, and account for the condition of the brave private's clothes. In preparing the charge-sheet for \" that terrible next morning \" the inspector was struck with the names and descriptions of the poor \"unfortunate \" and her rescuer. \" Polly Owen and Mike Sullivan. Where have I heard those two names before? \" and he scratched his sandy whiskers as if the answer lay at their roots. At all events, before Polly, dismissed with a pitiful caution, could carry her roughly-dried, bedraggled, and discoloured garments from the dock, a police-sergeant's hand was laid upon her shoulder, accompanied by words which not only sent a thrill of horror through the tender heart of Mike, but through the whole court, and drove her staggering back with face white as the lace on her captor's sleeve. \" Polly Owen, I arrest you in the Queen's name on a charge of child murder.\" Seven years before, in digging up the garden of a house in Hollo way, inhabited by two elderly maiden sisters, well known for their kindness and charity, the gardener had found the body of a female child, wrapped up in an apron known to have belonged to Polly Owen, who had been for six months in the Misses Evers-"], [87, "75 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. leighs' service, and quitted them on the pretext that she was going to \" better herself.\" They had taken her on trial from a \" Refuge for the Homeless,\" believing her to be destitute but not depraved, and anxious to preserve her from falling into greater depths. She had been treated with uniform kindness, and nursed by the old ladies, when suddenly prostrated by an illness for which they could not account, and for which she insisted she required no doctor ; and they had thought her somewhat ungrateful for giving them notice, and leaving immediately afterwards. The finding of the body, and the scandal it created, caused the Misses Eversleigh untold annoyance, and cheeked their benevolence in the direction it had taken. They had been called upon to give evidence at the inquest, and had casually mentioned Mrs. Martin Devereaux as a former mistress of the missing delinquent. That lady, with a laudable desire to keep her husband's brother clear of the case, named Mike Sullivan as a former sweetheart of the girl ; but he was then abroad with his regiment, and Polly Owen had herself dis appeared. She had been \" wanting \" for seven years ; and, throwing her self from Waterloo Bridge in her sudden anguish at encountering Mike, had thrown herself a prisoner into their hands. \" Och ! wirra, Polly, Polly, sure an' I wish I had let you dhrown 'fore it had come to this ! \" cried Mike, as if the words were wrung from his soul's agony, when these details were laid bare, and she was committed for trial at the sessions. The case went the round of the papers, headed, \" Attempted Suicide \u2014 Daring Rescue \u2014 Extraordinary Capture! \" and fell, not only into the hands of Mrs. Bancroft, but into those of Holmes, the clerk. He imprudently carried the news home to his wife, and Jenny, in no condition to be so troubled, hurried to Wrexham to communicate the ill -tidings to the old folk in their retired Welsh farm. She was taken so ill as to be unable to return, and there was a child the less on the hearth of the Holmes's in consequence. Old Mrs. Owen, distracted between care for the good daughter who had never given her an hour's pain, and for the castaway who had for years been such a grief to her, afraid to quit Jenny in her extremity, and equally dreading to leave her first-born friendless in her approaching trial , rocked to-and-fro in her chair in the bitterest distress. At last she consented to remain quiescent with Jenny, whilst the old man hastened to bespeak the interfer ence of Mr. Buckley in the prisoner's favour, nothing doubting that the portly solicitor, or his partner, could in some mysterious way bend or influence the course of law and justice to their will."], [88, "76 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. The old farmer, met on .the door-step by young Jonathan with school-books and slate in a strap, was hurriedly told to go in ! \u2022\" You'll find Holmes in the office. Mamma is upstairs packing to go to London in a great hurry, and papa is with her. Grand papa is out. I'm off to school. Good afternoon !\" How grateful was the distressed father to find his errand anticipated ! Sirs. Bancroft assured him, with tears in her eyes, that no effort should be spared to prove his lost child's innocence ol the crime laid to her charge. She took it much to heart, she said, that seeing Polly's weakness and vanity she had not endeavoured to induce her return to Chester, and her early friends, before all this evil came to pass. Farmer Owen was not a poor man. He put a \u00a320 note into Mr. Bancroft's hand, and asked him to use it for the poor girl any way he thought best, and was comforted by the assurance that all should be done for her that could. He kept his word. Himself got up the case, much to the annoy ance of Mrs. Devereaux, who agreed with her husband that it was \" quite impossible he should undertake the defence of the abandoned w'onian. It was not a case he cared to appear in.\" \"I am going to see poor Polly. Will you accompany me ?\" asked Barbara of her sister, with whom she was staying. \" Indeed I shall not ! I hope I have more respect for my position than to visit a woman of that stamp ; and in a prison, too !\" \" I will go with you, Aunt Barbara,\" volunteered Jessica, a pale sickly girl of twelve years, who had limped into the room unawares. \"Indeed you will do nothing of the kind, miss,\" interjected her mother sharply. \" No child of mine shall enter a prison doors to see any one ! \" \" But poor Polly Owen was my old nurse ! I remember her quite well, mamma.\" \" Then you will please to forget her as soon as possible, and don't let me hear her name again in this house \u2014 the impudent baggage !\" Mrs. Devereaux peremptorily retorted ; Jessica looking from aunt to mother in perplexed perturbation the while. Barbara interposed gently, \" My dear, it is not fit that a girl of your years should accompany me, even if it were permitted ; but I trust, when you are older, you will not shrink from an errand of mercy, even if it take you inside a prison.\" The prisoner had hitherto preserved a sullen silence. Mike had sent a lawyer to her, but she would tell him nothing. \" I don't care ! Look you, hang or trown's all as one to me. I want to pe dead,\" was all he could get out of her."], [89, "77 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. Yet the woman, hardened by a hard world, softened at the tearful appeal of quiet, tender Barbara, and her picture of the loving grief in her old Welsh home ; and told all that was necessary for lawyer or counsel to know. She denied most strenuously the murder of the infant, which she confessed was her own and Captain Devereaux's. It never lived, she said. Had it cried, Miss Eversleigh must have heard it. Finding it dead, she secreted it until able to bury it. And then, to secure herself from detection, she fled and fell into bad hands, and went herself from bad to worse, until she at last encountered Mike in the Strand. Her ruin she traced to a love of finery implanted by Mrs. Devereaux, which the Captain had still further excited by presents of trinkets and dress, until he induced her to throw her true-hearted follower over for him. When dismissed by Mrs. Devereaux, the Captain had taken a lodging for her under a false name, where, for a few months, he had visited her unknown to his servant, whose hot jealous temper both feared, although the Captain affected to laugh at it. During this time he had dressed her extravagantly. Soon his regiment was ordered abroad, and without more than a hasty line of apology and a five-pound note, he left her, without a character, to the mercy of the world. She was turned from her lodgings, failed to obtain employment, sank lower and lower, until she had to seek shelter and food in the Refuge where good Miss Eversleigh found her. She had heard, whilst at Devereaux's, that Jenny was about to marry Holmes ; and afterwards it stung her to madness to think that Mike would have made her his wife honestly ; and that for the sake of a trumpery silk dress, and a few such like things, she had thrown her life into the pit. Her story was a faithful one, and her counsel made the most of it ; and of the facts that no infant's cry had been heard ; and that, from the decomposed state of the body, the surgeon examined on the inquest could not be sure that the child had been born alive. That saved the life of Polly Owen. The judge commented strongly on the example a mistress set her servants in the matter of dress, and the grisly skeleton which often lurked under the folds of the silken dress ; he denounced the unmanly conduct of Captain Devereaux in the strongest terms, contrasting him with the brave private soldier, whose emotion in court had told so powerfully on all present ; and when the jury returned their verdict, \" Not guilty of murder; guilty of concealment of birth,\" he passed a lenient sentence."], [90, "78 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. Not half of her month's imprisonment had been served, when the town was startled by a tragedy. From the moment Michael Sullivan learned that his own captain had not only treacherously robbed him of the girl he loved, but added desertion to dishonour, he became a sullen moody man ; a sad one he had been from the day Polly had disappeared. He brooded over her injuries, and his own, until losing all command over himself, he seized a loaded gun in the barrack yard, and shot the captain down, and then \u2014 before he could be secured \u2014 turned a pistol against his own breast. They might pick up the bodies \u2014 officer and private were equal. No inquest or court-martial could restore life or award punishment. It was a terrible blow to the Devereaux. Everard, coming from Sussex to his brother Roland's funeral, did not fail to endorse the views of the judge, and administer a rebuke to the lady who sat indignant, in her crape and jet, behind the closed blind in Canon bury Square. She \" ought to have looked better after the girl in her charge.\" \"A mistress,\" he said, \" stood in loco parentis to her servant maids in the absence of their own parents, and owed them example as well as precept.\" She waxed wroth ; Martin, like a good husband, grew warm in her defence ; and there was a breach between the brothers. They shook hands over the dead Captain's coffin-lid ; but it was not with thorough brotherly earnestness ; and Everard Devereaux never entered Martin's house again. With her husband's sanction Barbara Bancroft remained in London, having promised the Owens to look after the wretched Polly when her term of imprisonment expired. It was anything but a comfortable month to her. Even before the Captain met his doom she had enough to trouble her in contemplation of the Devereaux's career. She saw little of her brother-in-law, who seemed to have no life apart from his chamber or the law courts. He had no lack of briefs, and his fees were heavy, but for all that he complained of difficulties and straitened circum stances ; the solution of which she saw in the dress of his wife and family, and the company they kept, even' though the master of the house was absent, or, just showing his face at the dinner table, resigned his post to a deputy, with an apology, and betook himself to his study. She observed also, with considerable pain, that Jessica, although the eldest girl, and entitled to all consideration on account of her lameness, was for that very calamity set aside to make way for her younger sisters, Geraldine and Clara \u2014 the"], [91, "79 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. former a petite spoiled beauty about ten years and a half old, the latter a haughty miss of nine. Jessica was irritable, it is true, and apt to complain of ill-usage, but she had far the best disposition ; and, considering that there was no religious law laid down to guide the young lives of the household, and that she was the butt on which all spent the shafts of their ridicule, and on whom Roland played practical j okesunreproved, her irritability is scarcely to be wondered at. The girl seemed to Barbara to have a remarkable musical genius, and she endeavoured to obtain for her faculty the cultiva tion it needed. \" Pooh, Barbara, you have always some queer notion or other in your head. I cannot afford to pay more for Jess than for her sister. Besides, a girl with a deformity like that is best kept in the background.\" \" Suppose I take Jessica back to Chester with me, Laura. We have only one, and shall not feel the expense of her education much. Besides, I want a companion, and Jessica would just suit me, I think.\" The daughter whom she could not parade was an eyesore to Mrs. Devereaux, and she hailed the proposal with ill-concealed delight, whilst Jessica herself made no pretence of hiding her own gratification. When the prison doors were open Mrs. Bancroft was there to receive the prisoner \u2014 not as a loathsome wretch to be cast into outer darkness, but as a woman with a spark of womanly shame left, a woman to be reclaimed by kindness. And Barbara set herself to the task of reclamation. It was winter time, and she had taken care to provide warm and respectable clothing for Polly with which to w*alk out into the world and begin a new life ; and her errand being known, she was permitted to hold converse in the governor's parlour with the released convict before the gates of freedom were finally opened. Moved by the gentle entreaties of Barbara, Polly burst into penitent tears, threw herself at her visitor's feet, and promised to lie guided henceforth by her, and to go back to her father's home if so be they were willing to receive so black a sinner. And so, when Mrs. Bancroft returned to Chester, she took with her, besides her delighted niece, a worn, haggard, stricken woman, borne down by sin and suffering, a Magdalen from the depths, to obtain pardon, hide her shame, and begin a new life on the old farm where life had begun with her. Mrs. Devereaux was greatly scandalised when she heard that her daughter and \" that vile wretch \" had travelled together,"], [92, "80 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. and would certainly have made it a cause of quarrel with Mrs. Bancroft, had she not feared lest in that case Barbara might withdraw her promise, and send the little-valued Jessica back on their hands. She need not have been afraid ; Barbara had undertaken the charge from no desire to relieve her fashionable sister. She saw there was more heart and more mind in the pale-faced butt of the family than either Mr. or Mrs. Devereaux had the wit to perceive, and, afraid lest mind and heart might be warped, and talents dwarfed or neglected, had desired to remove her ; and was not the one to relinquish a duty, even though Laura's upbraidings on the score of possible contamination had been more bitter than they were. Into their house Jessica was welcomed with open arms ; young Jonathan had learned to compassionate his lame cousin long before he saw her, and being some twelve or thirteen months her senior assumed a sort of protectorate quite new to her, who had looked upon boys (as represented by Boland) as biped bears. There no one wounded her sensibilities with glance or reference to her lameness, and gradually, very gradually, her irritability wore away, and, being happier, her pallid countenance assumed a more healthy tone. Then the absolute peace in her heart found utterance in song, and as she passed from room to room the echoes of her high-soled boot were lost in floods of exquisite melody. She had a voice of strange power and pathos, and Joseph, always ready to second his good wife's wishes, placed her under the cathedral's chief chorister for the cultivation of her divine faculty ; the worn-out piano was replaced with a new one, and in time Chester became conscious there was a great musician in its midst. I say in time. I do not mean months, I mean years \u2014 -years duringwhich medical skill had so far strengthened and straightened her limb, that the sole of her boot lost some of its extra inches ; years during which she had seen little of her father, less of her mother, and nothing of sisters and brother. More than mere distance divided the two households. Their elements were uncongenial, so no wonder the post-office was their medium for intercourse. Whilst on the one hand it was reported that Jonathan had been articled to his grandfather, whom he closely resembled, and that Jessica was growing comely, and sang and played enchant ingly, and that matters were in a generally satisfactory condition, even grey -haired Mr. Buckley keeping hale and strong; the Chester branch gathered from the letters of one or other that"], [93, "THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. 81 which set the elders talking gravely round the lamp at night, whilst Jessica's fingers wandered over the piano keys, and Jonathan turned the music for her, and joined his voice to hers, all unconscious of the depth of harmony they made. From time to time they had gleaned from letters written in all moods by all members of the family, by the jaunty youth, the growing girls, the fashionable mother, the anxious, overworked father \u2014 gleaned from an entangled maze of receptions and enter tainments, and descriptions of the dresses of the visited and visiting, the crinolines and grenadines \u2014 of high spirits and grumbling and growling \u2014 gleaned, an ear at a time, here and there, this sheaf of facts. The persuasions of Mrs. Devereaux had prevailed ; there had been migration from Canonbury to Sloane Street. A private governess had been engaged to form the minds and manners of Geraldine and Clara. Roland, having at Cambridge devoted himself more to boating and champagne parties than to study, he was plucked at the \"little-go,\" and went home in disgrace, followed by a shower of bills, which came down on Martin's head like a snowstorm (that head so prematurely grey and bald). Consequently his uncle Everard revoked his promise to purchase him a commission, bidding him make his own way in the world ; he was not going to help him into his uncle Roland's shoes, lest he should wear them no better. Then relenting, he obtained him a post in a Government office, where the work was light and the salary respectable. This seemed to be a season of rejoicing ; Martin, who had added literature to his labours, and long felt that a fashionable wife was not an unmixed blessing, breathed afresh. But soon his daughter Geraldine \" came out,\" and Mrs. Devereaux, true to her instincts, dressed the diminutive belle in the most airy of robes the swelling crinoline could effectually display, much as an angler dresses a fly on the hook to catch unwary fish ; and balls, dinner parties, and garden parties followed each other in quick succession. At length a gudgeon rose to the bait \u2014 Miss Geraldine landed her prize ; and now that her sister was engaged, Miss Clara clamoured to enter society also. Martin grumbled at the cost ; insisted that Laura would ruin him ; that debt and duns were alike disgraceful to a man of his standing ; that the girls would get no better husbands for all their elaborate toilets and expensive jewellery. He was \" weary of parade and pretence.\" But Mrs. Martin Devereaux carried the day, and Miss Clara was handed over to milliner and dressmaker to set her proud beauty off to the best advantage. Clara's letter, anticipatory of her first ball, had been received the G"], [94, "82 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. previous day by the sister she hoped to overwhelm with her glowing descriptions of green or white tarlatane overskirts, looped with rosebuds and white satin slippers, and marabout-tipped fans. It had furnished matter for grave fears that there would be a crash at the Devereaux's ere long, if Martin did not put a curb on the grey mare. Joseph had lent money to his brother-in-law and knew him to be involved. Barbara, neat and trim and matronly, folded up her sewing with a sigh for her extravagant half-sister ; and Jessica was rising from the music-stool, when a sharp ring at the door-bell startled the whole party. A telegram from London ! The crash had indeed come ! Geraldine had been burnt to death ! Waltzing with her lover, the light crinoline-distended tarlatane she wore had swept too near an unguarded fire-place ; was in flames before the whirling dancer saw her peril, the very motion helping on destruction, and before a coat or a rug could be wrapped round her she was past help. There was a hasty conference. Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft decided it was their duty to visit their relatives in their affliction, though personal intercourse had long dropped. Jessica pleaded hard to go with them, and that conceded, Jonathan would fain be of the party too. They found everything in the wildest confusion. Mrs. Dever eaux was in her own chamber in hysterics, Clara alternately wringing her hands and sobbing, utterly helpless. The inquest just closed had revealed that which the crinoline had concealed. The mother of Geraldine Devereaux, who had flung so many pitiless stones at erring Polly Owen, knew that her favourite daughter's shame would be bruited to the world before the day was out ; and the sting was sharper than death. It was well, then, that the telegram Martin had despatched to Joseph Bancroft had met such full response. There was work for each and all to do \u2014 for the ministrations of Jessica and Barbara within the house and by the bedside, and for the Bancrofts, father and son, to help young Roland in that time of special emergency. For that which threw Laura Devereaux into hysterics, threw her overworked and embarrassed husband into an asylum, and before two years were gone she was a widow. When Martin Devereaux was known to have succumbed, his creditors came pouring in, aye, before the scorched remains of Geraldine had well been consigned to Brompton Cemetery."], [95, "83 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. Martin's chambers were despoiled, and the house in Sloane Street had to be surrendered with all that it contained. It was a terrible blow to proud Mrs. Devereaux to sink from the mistress of such a home to the mere tenant of lodgings in Bedford Square, yet was she glad to hide her head anywhere. It was not until she was absolutely a widow that she shook off' her depression, saying that she \" must rouse for Clara's sake, since Roland would do nothing for his sister.\" The fact was, that Roland, thrown on his own resources, had found quite enough to do to look after himself. When there was no father to tax in an emergency he had to fall back on his own resources, which had hitherto been found inadequate. Self-denial\" had no place in his calendar, and soon Mrs. Devereaux had another shock. To supply his extravagant habits her son appropriated Government cash and securities in his charge, and the same prison which had engulfed Polly Owen closed its ponderous jaws on Ronald Devereaux, and only the influence of his Uncle Everard saved the ill-trained young man from penal servitude. Surely Mrs. Devereaux must have felt how much of this evil had its origin in her own immoderate love of dress and display ? No, she considered herself a martyr ; one on whom misfortune's deadliest shafts had fallen unprovoked. Joseph Bancroft had rescued some little from the wreck of her husband's affairs, and with that, and the interest of her three thousand pounds still intact, she retired to Brighton with Clara, in hopes, when scandal had blown over, to marry the girl off her hands. Jessica, seemingly in the way, had gone back with her better friends to Chester. In Brighton Mrs. Devereaux's ruling passion asserted itself. Her weeds discarded, she dressed more like the wife of the successful barrister than the widow of a bankrupt one, the mother of a criminal son. She wore the largest crinoline, and the gayest colours that ever promenaded the Steyn or the Parade. And ere long she felt in her own person the effects of her life long folly. Walking up James Street from the Steyn, where the steep hill rises at its narrowest part, the wheel of a passing cart caught her extensive crinoline, dragged her down, and ran over her. Medical aid was soon on the spot, and all was done that could be done to alleviate her sufferings, but the internal injuries she had sustained proved fatal ; she, however, lived to see her sister and Jessica once more, but there was no acknowledgment of life-long folly. She deplored the use of crinoline, saying that"], [96, "84 THE SKELETON UNDER THE SKIRT. she owed her death to the skeleton under the skirt, but not even on her death-bed could she see there had been a skeleton under the skirt even before crinoline was dreamed of, or that her death was but a fitting commentary on her life, or that on her rested the awful responsibility of Polly Owen's sin and its contingencies. Ronald, released from gaol, laid claim to his mother's property at her death, leaving Clara to shift for herself. But Jessica, who had long turned her musical genius to account, and was gaining celebrity as a composer, proposed to play and sing in public to maintain her sister and self. There was a strong demur to this in the Chester lawyer's house \u2014 the old grandfather laying siege to his chin most emphatically. Jonathan had, however, the most powerful voice in the matter, and he insisted on keeping that special singing bird in a cage of his own. Clara might share it if she liked, but Jessica must be his wife, and he would take no \" nay.\""], [97, "THE PURITAN'S WILL : A STORY OF DURHAM AT THE CLOSE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. CHAPTER I. There was a note of alarm throughout the country ! Whence it emanated no one could tell, but certain it was, rumours were rife that emissaries of Philip, King of Spain, were at work disseminating the seeds of disloyalty. In those days parliaments were rarely summoned, save to grant subsidies, and so replenish the royal exchequer. Queen Elizabeth contrived to dispense with them almost wholly, her own will being the law with which she ruled ; edicts and proclamations serving to make it known. Accordingly, when these rumours, which might have had their origin in her court, reached the ears of the Queen (grown timorous in her old age), without pausing to ascertain their truth, she roused herself like a lioness in her lair, and her growl was heard to the uttermost parts of her realm. Men's hearts sank at the sound, for the claws of the lioness were far-reaching, terrible, and sharp, and lacerated even when the deadly fangs spared. In 1591 Elizabeth issued a proclamation, distinguished by the violence of its language against Spain, the Pope, and the mission aries, ordering all householders to make returns of every person who had resorted to their houses for twelve months past, and to specify whether they knew any who was accustomed to absent himself from the established service of the church. To this proclamation were appended instructions for certain commissioners in each county to receive those returns, and to discover \" by all means in their power \" missionaries, or persons withdrawn from their allegiance by the arts of the missionaries. , It may be imagined what scope was given to the malignant and revengeful to work their evil will in those days of rough law and scant justice. Then the gag, the rack, the scavenger's daughter, and other instruments of torture forced frenzied confessions from quivering lips ; evidence against the suspected \"was accepted as proof, where now it would be sifted and analysed ; trial was but a mockery ; and if execution did not rapidly follow"], [98, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 86 accusation, at least long and painful imprisonment wore out the victim's strength. In the good city of Durham, Matthew Farrales and his friend Henry Smyth were distinguished for their zeal in aiding the commissioners in their search for the priestly emissaries of Spain. Matthew Farrales was the owner of Drawdon, a wooden-frame house, with lattice windows and many gables. It had two closes and two well-stocked orchards, and lay between the com mon road leading to Erlehouses and the high road leading to the Spitalhouse. On a swift and picturesque burn or stream by which it was watered, Matthew Farrales had recently erected a fulling-mill, as a first step towards the promotion of cloth working in the city. A neighbouring yeoman, named Lumley, had stoutly opposed the erection of this mill, and had even gone to law about it. He ob jected that the water of the burn was fouled before it came to him. But his plea was dismissed as frivolous, seeing that he was not dependent on that special burn either for domestic purposes, the irrigation of his land, or the watering of his cattle. Stung with the loss of his suit, no less than the loss of money it involved, Simon Lumley rushed through the halberdiers who guarded the crowded court, vowing vengeance, not only against his successful opponent, but against the lawyer to whose skill he attributed his defeat. So much are men misled and blinded by their own passions. This lawyer was Henry Smyth, a man eminent in Ms profession when the law was less systematic than it is now. He was a tall man, grave and resolute in face and bearing, and wore the long loose gown and flat cap appointed for men of his class. The royal dame on the throne as imperiously dictated what her subjects should wear as what they should believe, and how they should worship. He had one child, Grace ; a dark-eyed, dark-haired girl. She had inherited her mother's beauty of face and form, and her impressionable nature ; but from the father derived a will as resolute as his own, however it might be held in abeyance by religion and filial duty. Her mother had died when she was but a child, and Mistress Grace had been alternately scolded and fondled by Hannah Heaviside, an elderly woman promoted from the nursery to preside over the household in Silver Street when the wealthy lawyer lost his well-loved wife. Those were not times when a young girl could wander hither and thither, just as inclination led. It was neither safe nor prudent to traverse the streets, even at mid-day, without a"], [99, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 87 protector, albeit the protector was but an elderly female. So Mistress Grace's walks abroad were pretty much restricted to the limits of their own garden, which sloped down to the very edge of the river Wear, unless Hannah Heaviside could be persuaded to don pinner and coif, and guard her to the mercer's or the glover's. On Sundays, Master Smyth himself bore her carefully to and from the cathedral ; though in his soul he rebelled against the ceremonials observed, as retaining too much the air of Popery. Occasionally, too, the sedate lawyer, who loved his daughter with his whole heart, would lead her under the towered gateway which guarded Framwellgate Bridge, turn to the right along Milburngate and the row of houses which then constituted Fram wellgate \u2014 the very names of which are suggestive \u2014 and so on past the grim gallows on the North Road to Drawdon, the picturesque home of his friend Farrales. The more direct Neio North Road was then undreamed of. Very pleasant to Grace had been these far-between country walks, very delicious the fruit gathered in those ample orchards, and very cordial the reception Matthew Farrales ever gave to father and daughter. Oft-times they would find a company of sedate men and women assembled, and then religious discussion would arise, followed by religious worship, not according to the rubric, but worship in which the forms and ceremonials of the Church were set aside. Master Henry Smyth and Master Matthew Farrales belonged to that new section of ultra-Protestants to whom the name of Puritan had been given, as designating the purity of life and doctrine they professed ; and hitherto, fortunately for them, they had escaped the fines consequent on such profession, since Puritanism was held to be little less dangerous to the State than Popery. The time came, however, when lovely Mistress Grace was less eager to accompany her father to Drawdon. It was not that she wearied of the walk, or of the long conversations concerning the coal pits of her father, or the fulling-mill of their host, or of lengthy prayers. The air was as balmy, the burn danced as brightly and plashed as musically in its downward course, the fruits were as delicious, their reception as warm \u2014 nay, warmer. Ah, that was it ! The hand of Master Farrales held that of Mistress Grace too closely for common greeting and farewell ; his grey eyes looked into hers with a longing look that brought the crimson blood into her cheeks, his voice sank lower as he asked her how she fared ; and though her father had keen eyes and ears, not one word of rebuke had he. Matthew Farrales was in love with Mistress Grace, and she"], [100, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 88 saw it. But Mistress Grace was not in love with Matthew Farrales. The owner of Drawdon was quite thirty-five years of age, as staid and grave in his demeanour as was her father, but she had found a younger and gayer wooer ; or, rather, the younger wooer coming to Master Henry Smyth for law, had found not the lawyer but his daughter, and had straightway come to her for \u2014 love. A handsome gallant of noble presence was Master Robert Maire, of Hardwick-by-the-Sea ; and when Hannah Heaviside ushered him into the back parlour, where Mistress Grace sat knitting a pair of yellow worsted hose for her sire, there to await her master's presence, she seemed to let in a brighter ray of sunshine than that which streamed through the open casement on the uplifted head of the beautiful maiden. Three parts of an hour elapsed before Master Smyth was at liberty to attend to his new client, but Master Maire had displayed neither restlessness nor impatience. Belonging to the old gentry of the county, he had moved in a sphere into which the burgher class, however wealthy, rarely found admission ; and the ease of manner which it gave enabled him to approach the shy young girl without undue constraint, and gradually to thaw the ice of her demeanour. He engaged her in conversation, told her stories of life in the great world, and found out that she knew something of books as well as of housewifery, though the former were chiefly of a grave and pious character. But seeing Sir Thomas More's \" Utopia\" on the buffet, side by side with \" Tyndall's Bible \" and \" Fox's Book of Martyrs,\" he questioned her thereon, and found that her Latinity was only equalled by her modesty. But of the poets then making a stir in the capital, the fairest gems in Elizabeth's crown, she knew little more than the names. Of Master Shakes peare she had heard, and of Ben Jonson and of Marlowe, but as playwrights only, hanging about theatres, or roystering at the \" Mermaid \" and other taverns, but of their writings she knew nothing ; nor yet knew she the poetry of Surrey and Wyatt. Her education had been of quite a different stamp. It was a rare pleasure, then, for Master Maire to repeat \" The Loyal Lover,\" \" My Sweet Sweeting,\" \" Give place, ye lovers,\" and Marlowe's \" Invitation,\" and to watch the cheeks flush, and the eyes droop as she listened. Never before had such music penetrated her ears, never before had a voice so sweetly modulated spoken to her soul in the language of poesy. Never before had he had so fresh, so entranced a listener."], [101, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 89 No wonder, then, if his eyes and intonation gave special point to the impassioned verse. No wonder that time stood still , and Master Smyth's apologies for long delay were received so graciously. No wonder that Master Robert carried the image of Mistress Grace home with him to Hardwick, or that gold lace, murrey-coloured velvet, satin slashings, plumed cap, jewelled hands, and embroidered kerchief floated through her dreams, mingled with a sense of perfume and melody, or that \" My Sweet Sweeting \" haunted her day and night, to the detriment of her household duties. Nor is it to be wondered that, when a week later Robert Maire made occasion to put some profitable business into the lawyer's hands, and being thereupon invited to share the mid-day meal, was again ushered into the presence of Miss Grace \u2014 Eyes looked love to eyes that spake again. Once more the feather in his velvet cap swept the rush-strewn floor in salutation, once more the graceful neck inclined within its stiffened ruff, and the pliant limbs sank low in acknowledg ment ; but this time there was a sympathetic something in the air, sweeter than the scent of June roses or. gilliflowers wafted in from the long garden. Little could Master Smyth have foreseen the consequences of this introduction, or he would have shut the door upon him and his business, and bade him begone elsewhere. Where Grace saw only a handsome cavalier rendering respectful homage to her beauty and intelligence, her father, keen enough in other respects, saw only a wealthy client with an estate to be managed ; one whose state and position in the county barred familiar intercourse. Besides which, he was cognisant Matthew Farrales w*as wooing Grace after his own fashion, and if he had not spoken out, would speak ere long ; and easily confident that so deserving and pious a man, so true a friend, so loyal a subject, must be equally attractive to his daughter, no thought of other possible attachment crossed his mind. But love, spurred by youth and beauty, overleaps the barriers of rank and fortune. To Mistress Grace, mewed up in her pictureless panelled room, with few books, no poetry, no music to relieve the monotony of her life ; with nothing to feed the eye but the narrow strip of garden, the rushing river and the houses on the opposite bank ; -who turned from tapestry and knitting in the parlour, to clear starching, confectionery, and the distillation of herbs in the kitchen, -who saw in the cramped precincts of the city but grey-jerkined"], [102, "90 THE PURITAN'S WILL. apprentices, hooded craftsmen clad in greasy leather, tradesmen in doublet and hose of sober cloth, and wealthier burghers in leather-girdled long blue gowns, yellow hose and flat caps ; coarse billmen and halberdiers with their steel morions ; or occasionally aldermen or ecclesiastics in their robes of office ; to her, shut out, more even than other damsels of her age, from all objects of taste and beauty, from gaiety and fashion ; to her, the courtly gentle man, richly apparelled, delicately perfumed, handsome and elegant, fluent and accomplished, came like a divinity, the realization of a paradisal dream. To him, fresh from a region of ruffs and farthingales, brocades and taffetas, paint and jewels, the modest attire and unstudied graces of the Puritan's daughter made her loveliness dangerous, and ere he knew it his heart was gone. CHAPTER H. Master Farrales was the first to anticipate danger. For some months Robert Maire, on the pretext of business, had ridden into Durham, attended by Roger, his serving-man, at least once every week ; and as surely his business led him to Silver Street. He was not always fortunate enough to be invited to step into the household room, but after a time he contrived to have the happy knack of calling when the lawyer was from home ; and having made himself agreeable to Goody Heaviside by skilfully concealed bribes, he managed so as to await Master Smyth's return in the company of the charming Grace. For her, too, he had gifts, a flower, a bit of sea- weed or a shell from the beach ; trifles offered courteously and naturally, and not to be refused without prudery. But well did Robert Maire know that they were hidden from prying eyes, and treasured as price less. Then, bolder grown, he brought a copy of + \" Tottel's Miscellanies,\" with Surrey's Sonnets to Geraldine, underlined for her perusal, accompanied by a spoken word which made her heart leap, and her brow suffuse, as he carried her imprisoned. hand to his lips, and left a kiss upon it. Fain would he have clasped her to his enamoured heart, but there was a halo of purity about her, and a spirit of chivalrous honour in him, which made her sacred whilst love was unavowed, and no fatherly sanction gave it warranty. Matthew Farrales, it has been said, precipitated disclosures. t Published 1557."], [103, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 91 His love was of long duration, had grown with Grace from girlhood to womanhood, but he had waited and waited for some token that her frank undisguised friendship had its roots in love. He waited in vain ; she accepted his attentions all unconscious of their meaning, until the awakening of her own heart supplied a clue to his. Then she became constrained and embarrassed, the lingering touch of his hand had a new meaning, the \" Dear Grace,\" with which he was wont to greet her, made her shrink and blush with a consciousness which he unfortunately misin terpreted. \" Master Smyth, have I thy consent to woo Mistress Grace ?\" had long been asked, and answered in ready affirmation. \" Friend Matthew, that thou lovest Grace I have long observed. Thou art a pious and an upright man ; I could not trust my child's welfare in better keeping. When thou hast her consent thou hast mine.\" But, timid and apprehensive of his own deserts, Master Farrales let opportunity slip by. Summer \u2014 the summer of 1590 \u2014 was on the wane, the early autumn fruits weighed down the branches ripe for the gatherer, the wheat harvest bent its golden brown ears to the reaper, ere he spake. One hot day about this time, Master Smyth, observing the listlessness of his child, said, \" Thou lookest pale to-day, Grace ; put down the napery thou art darning, and come with me to Drawdon ; the sun here is oppressive there may be a breeze upon the hill, and Master Matthew will welcome us right heartily.\" \" Nay, father, I am well \u2014 quite well ; I will not take thee from thy business.\" \" Tut, tut ; since the plague broke out last year in Gilesgate, I feel as if the air of Durham was scarcely pure enough for thee, my precious blossom. I have marked of late thy colour come and go, the work drop from thy listless hand, and thy head droop wearily. Thou art pining in this close room ; the walk to Drawdon will be a pleasant change. Besides, I have matter for Master Farrales' private ear, as I have often thought he had for thine.\" . A deeper flush bespread her face, but not daring to reveal the secret of her recent languor \u2014 the very fitfulness of \" love's young dream \" \u2014 she donned her steeple hat, and they went out, an under-clerk with a stout cudgel following at their heels for pro tection. As they toiled up the steep North Road, a wain laden with golden"], [104, "92 THE PURITAN'S WILL. sheaves was lumbering through Simon Lumley's gate, and he stood there directing the carter. As they approached, a hungry look of undisguised admiration came into his face as his eyes rested on Grace. As rapidly, a scowl succeeded ; he pointed to the waggon-load, and growled rather than said, \" This is your work, Master Smyth. An honest yeoman compelled to sell his fresh-cut corn to pay a lawyer's costs ! Ah, carry the tale of triumph and your daughter both to Drawdon ; they will be alike acceptable to the flourishing fuller ! But, mark ye, I will be revenged one day \u2014 aye, if I die on yonder gallows for it.\" \" Master Lumley, thine own envious passions are alone to blame. Master Farrales did but defend his right, and I was but the agent of the law. May God and time give thee cooler judgment ! \" Muttered threats and curses followed them as they passed on, Grace clasping tightly her father's arm, and Cuthbert, the under clerk, gripping his staff as if for ready use. \" Barking dogs rarely bite, my child,\" quoth the lawyer, sesking to allay her fears ; but he knew the times were such that a treacherous foe so near might prove dangerous, and on reaching D:'awdon he drew its owner aside for private conference, con signing Grace to the complimentary housekeeper, and Cuthbert to the buttery. Grace soon released the good dame from her attendance, and scrolling through the grounds where the umbrageous trees were the thickest, found her way through the underwood to the head of the litigated burn, and sitting down in a ferny nook watched the limpid waters rush through the narrow gorge, leaping and chafing over its rocky bed on to the mill below. She had seen nothing of Master Robert Maire for many days, and sat pondering whether the fair phrases, the winning voice, the mute admiration, the delicate flattery of look and word, the poems marked to express so much, the very kiss upon her hand, were so much courtly gallantry bestowed upon the burgher's daughter but to pass the time ; or if her prescient heart was right, and her love but the echo of his adoration. Absorbed in thought, she neither saw nor heard the approach of Master Farrales, and, startled from her reverie, gave a slight scream as he threw himself on the bank beside her. \"Mistress Grace, I fear I broke upon your meditations too abruptly. Nay, do not rise ; there is somewhat I would say to thee ; and surely never were time and place more opportune.\" He had caught her hand to detain her, and though she sat at his bidding, he did not let it go."], [105, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 93 \" Grace, dear Mistress Grace, I have long sought this opportu nity \u2014 but now \u2014 even now \" \u2014 something seemed to choke him \u2014 \" Grace, I am a clumsy wooer \u2014 but I love you, love you with my whole heart \u2014 have loved you for years. Will you, will you be my wife ?\" He grasped both her hands, gazed up into her face with a yearning, beseeching look, painful in its intensity, as she saw through the mist of her tears ; but surprise, sorrow, sympathy, fear, kept her silent. \" You do not speak, your eyes are full of tears, you look sad ? What may this mean ? Am I mistaken ? Grace, Grace, do not keep me in suspense.\" \" Oh, Master Farrales, I was not \u2014 I am \u2014 Alas, alas \u2014 you have been even as a brother unto me ; I was not prepared \" \" Peradventure I have been too hasty, sweet Mistress Grace ; yet your father bade me ' God speed ' when I came hither ; surely the daughter cannot say me less ? \" he interposed hurriedly, yet imploringly. \"Master Farrales, my father's best friend, \u2014 truly it gives me pain to say you ' nay,' \u2014 but this thing cannot be.\" \"Cannot! Mistress Grace! Oh, think again, give me some hope to cling to.\" He spoke despairingly, and her agitation almost equalled his own ; but she had no hope to give him, and esteemed him too highly to trifle with feelings whose depth had never been revealed until then. The hand she had withdrawn from him, she gave again in token of friendly amity ; he covered it with kisses ere he dropped it reluctantly and sadly, saying, \" Friends, then, Mistress Grace, let it be, if needs must ; friends, until your own heart warrants a renewal of my suit ! \" Master Henry Smyth, better read in law than love, ascribed her refusal to ignorance of her own untutored heart and maidenly reserve; consoling his friend with the adage that \"nine naysays were half a grant.\" \" Grace is coy, no doubt, friend Matthew ; but give her time, give her time, and you will win her yet.\" So encouraged, Master Farrales, though honourably dumb on the passion that consumed him, came and went as heretofore, entering the house in Silver Street, perhaps with a little more constraint ; but he relaxed no attention, omitted no duty, till Grace confessed to herself his silent devotion made her grieve for him. As the last red leaves dropped from the autumnal trees his last hope fell with them."], [106, "94 THE PURITAN'S WILL. Entering in the twilight, unannounced and unheard, the parlour in Silver Street \u2014 he saw that which sent the blood to his heart and left him white as ashes. A graceful, handsome man, younger than himself, in cloak and doublet of blue and silver, stood with Grace before the fire, his arm around her, her head drooped lovingly upon his breast, his face bent down to hers, his lips upon her forehead. For a few moments he stood aghast, as if a serpent had stung him ; then stifling a groan, he turned away noiselessly to leave the house at once with his great load of misery. On the doorstep he encountered Master Smyth, and would have hurried past him ; but the lawyer caught him by the arm, and, seeing his white face, wrung from him words of agony which sent the father to ascertain what wrong his dear friend had sustained at his child's hands. He had swung the door to with a clash, and trod the dark passage with firm foot that drowned the flutter in the room ; so he was spared the sight that had blighted his dearest friend's life. Mistress Grace sat on her accustomed stool on one side the wide fire-place, and Master Robert Maire stood leaning negligently against the carved chimney-piece upon the other, idly playing with the hilt of his sword. But the damsel's knitting lay upon the floor, the ravelled spoil of a playful kitten, and her com posure was ill sustained. \" What hast thou done to Matthew Farrales, Mistress Grace? I met him with a face as white as thine own kerchief.\" \" I, father ! Nothing. Master Farrales has not been here these three days.\" \" Not here, wench ! I met him but now on the door-step, scared and wild as though he had seen a spectre !\" \" I know not this Master Farrales, sir, but on the honour of a gentleman no one has entered this room within the past hour,\" protested Master Maire. Master Smyth's suspicions were awake now. He had been there, and why not seen ? What had he seen ? He was not the man to beat about the bush. He put the question. \" Master Robert Maire, I find you here alone with Mistress Grace ; I met on the door-step the man who comes hither with my full consent as her suitor, fleeing from some dreadful wrong. I ask an explanation. What can he have heard or seen ? \" The conscious blood mantled to the cheek of Grace. Robert Maire, proudly confronting the proud old man, approached her. \" Come hither, Grace, my love,\" said he, drawing her to him, throwing his protecting arm around her, and drawing her head"], [107, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 95 \"to his broad breast. \" This is what he may perchance have seen. I, too, came as a suitor for your daughter's hand ; I have won her love fairly, and I seek your assent, not to woo but to wed. Is it not so, Grace ? \" \"Not Grace \u2014 but graceless \u2014 go to your chamber, Mistress, and learn obedience there. Master Maire, release her ! You and I will have a word ere you depart.\" The arm around her tightened ; there was a whisper in her ear, a kiss upon her forehead ; the arm relaxed, and with a reverence to her father, Grace left the room, entangled in a maze of doubt, perplexity, and dread, over which faith in her lover rose triumphant. There was a stormy interview when she was gone. Master Smyth accused Robert Maire of treachery and duplicity, which he resented resolutely. Yet he strove to conciliate, and pleaded in justification that he had found Mistress Grace dejected, nay, in tears, and trying to soothe her sorrow the floodgates of his heart gave way, and the full torrent of his love broke forth unbidden. He had waited but Master Smyth's return to lay the matter before him honourably. Master Farrale's entrance had placed him in a false position ; but it was true nevertheless , He trusted Grace would not be coerced into marrying where she did not love ; and with all a lover's ardour, stimulated by his fears, he pleaded for Master Smyth's consent to their union as one pleading for life. It was in vain. All that would have had weight with other men was useless here. What cared Master Smyth for Hard wick or the manor of Heselden, or revenues from Hutton-Henry, in comparison with his child's eternal welfare ? What cared he for ancestral hall or fine raiment ? \u2014 they were the gauds of Satan to entrap souls. Of wealth Master Farrales was not bare, and he could himself endow his daughter abundantly. Robert Maire savoured of the world ; Matthew Farrales was one of God's own people, and would be a sure stay for his child. So the young lover's suit was denied \u2014 courteously but firmly. ' ' I have promised my daughter to Matthew Farrales, and I cannot break my word.\" CHAPTER III. For some time Matthew Farrales held aloof from Silver Street ; he had received a blow from which a man of his temperament does not readily recover. Even the assurance of Master Smyth,"], [108, "96 THE PURITAN'S WILL. that the would-be gallant was dismissed, failed to bring him back to try his chance again. He had waited all the years wherein girlhood grew into womanhood, to win Grace's love, could wait for years to come, but to marry her whdst loving another man came not within his philosophy. Master Maire still entrusted Master Henry Smyth with his legal matters, but never again was admitted to the wainscotted room behind, where he knew his darling was pining like a solitary dove in a cage. Hannah Heaviside was incorruptible ; she loved Mistress Grace, but she loved dominion better ; her post was profitable and honourable, and she did \" not choose to risk it for all the gallants in doublet and hose.\" He haunted Durham, lived more at the hostelry in Elvet than at Hard wick, set a watch upon the house, and at length had his perseverance rewarded by intercepting father and daughter on their way from St. Oswald's Church. Master Smyth would have hurried past, but Robert Maire was not easily set aside, and his courteous salutation admitted no rude rebuff. A gracious word, a brief pressure of the hand, a quick re-assuring glance were all, but they kept hope alive in the hearts of both, and love will live where even hope expires. For all that Grace visibly drooped, and soon Master Smyth began to talk of bearing her away to Longstack Farm, to visit a cousin in Hampshire, for the recovery of her health. It was, however, too late in the season to attempt so long and perilous a journey, and many arrangements in the interest of his clients had to be made before he could be spared to travel. Christmas was fast approaching, but in the early spring he would see, God will ing, what effect a southern climate would have upon the maiden. The assent of Mistress Grace to this proposal was never asked. It was not thought necessary. Yet hearing the subject mooted, she opposed it strenuously, the effect being to confirm Master Smyth in his decision. Nor did she submit to the dismissal of her lover without an attempt at rebellion. She was persistent in her declaration that unless she married Robert Maire she would die unwedded \u2014 -words her father recalled with a shudder ere the year was out. Towards the close of the dreary month of fogs, she ceased either to rebel or to pine ; yet care, anxiety, and a curious ner vous restlessness seemed to grow upon her. Matthew Farrales had resumed his visits, and to that her father ascribed the healthy change. He knew nothing of the bulky missives closed with a lover's knot of floss silk which Cuthbert the clerk, well-paid for the service, contrived to pass in secret from Robert to Grace."], [109, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 97 Christmas approached \u2014 clear, sharp, crisp, bright ; people huddled within doors for warmth, or, cloaked and hooded, bustled through the unpaved streets, thankful that frost had bound up the muddy ruts and given a firm hard roadway to be trodden and stamped upon. Then as now the shops assumed a gayer aspect, though there was no gas to make them gorgeous after nightfall. But by nightfall all prudent citizens had closed the shutters of their open shops, for purchasers had gone to their homes, and prowling vagabonds were on the alert. The silversmiths in the street which bore their name, the lorrimers,* the glovers, the saddlers, clustered together in Saddler Street, the cordwainersf and the mercers each by themselves, all made a goodly show for the year's great festival, and \" What d'ye lack ? What d'ye lack ?\" from apprentices hoarse with bawling, offi ciously pressed their masters' wares upon the public. In the market, booths and stalls were piled with divers goods to suit the country folk, or frugal city housewives. There fat oxen were bought and sold for six-and-twenty shillings, sheep and calves for three and fourpence each ; and in Fleshergate the butchers cried their beef one penny for one pound ! Holly and mistletoe garnished the walls of rich and poor, fires roared and crackled in the open chimneys ; the coal pits of Henry Smyth and others could hardly supply the demands upon them. In the houses of the rich alms were already collected for dis tribution, and the poor were looking eagerly forward to the Christmas almsgiving. \" Greetings in the market-place \" bore touching reference to the season and its amenities, and (inspired by its influence, per chance) Robert Maire plied the huge knocker on the lawyer's outer door, and craved a private audience. Once more he asked of Henry Smyth his daughter Grace in marriage, even after long probation ; urged it with the eloquence and warmth of an ardent, impassioned man. And once more Henry Smyth denied him. Somewhat softened he was, perhaps ; but he denied him notwith standing. He would not even permit the pair to exchange Christmas greetings. \" Is that your final determination, Master Smyth ?\" \"It is, Master Maire.\" \" And you have no pity for your daughter or for me, even at this Christmas-tide?\" \"I do feel grieved at your distress, Master Maire, but it will pass in time ; and it is because I do love my child I would spare *Lorrimers : Spurmakers. t Cordwainers: Shoemakers.

She is at peace now, forgetting her brief fancy, I trust; I cannot have that peace disturbed;\" and the speaker looked desirous to terminate the interview. \" It is not my wont to sue for the same boon twice,\" said the young man, impressively. \" Remember this interview, if ere long you repent your decision.\" And with a firm step, a face resolute as the one before him, Robert Maire departed. The morrow came. A busy day for Grace. From Master Smyth's collieries came the pitmen, their wives, their bairns, as was their wont, for Christmas gifts and Christmas cheer of cakes and ale, and as was his wont, Matthew Farrales assisted her in their distribution. Later in the day, a feast of beef and brawn, and such substantial fare, was laid upon a long oak table in the capacious kitchen, set forth with wooden trenchers and drinking horns, with huge flagons here and there. His clerks and over seers came to partake, himself and Grace presiding ; Matthew Farrales again being close at her elbow, his homage shown in every act. His eyes spake what was in his thought, but true to his promise, his tongue was silent. Master Smyth, thinking so to bend his daughter's will, kept not so silent : he bade his depend ents drink to his son-in-law that should be. Grace, flushing, hurried from the board, closely followed by Matthew, protesting as he went that it was not his prompting. \" If it be not, Master Farrales, and you be a true man, then in the name of Heaven disclaim your pretensions to my hand openly, and release me from the bonds my father would impose,\" cried she, as they stood face to face ii} her own parlour. \" I cannot, Grace ; I cannot.\" \" But I love another man, and you know it. Be your noble self, and resign me.\" His lips blanched and quivered. \" I cannot, Grace ; I cannot. I will wait for years ; but resign the hope of winning your love in time, I cannot!\" \"Then must I release myself!\" So saying she returned to the guests, assuming a composure her eye and cheek dis proved. The board had been cleared, the yule-log was blazing on the hearth ; games, sober, as befitted the home of a Puritan, were introduced, as were the wassail bowl, and sweet confections. Outside, the watch, the waits, the carol singers came in turns, each group receiving a Christmas dole. The hours sped, another group of carollers sang, one rich voice swelling above the rest \u2014 Grace, as before, dispensed the dole."], [111, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 99 Midnight approached, and Grace, drawing near to her father, asked his Christmas benediction. The Christmas bells rang out ; neighbour shook hands with neighbour ; but where was Mistress Grace ? Aye, where ? Hurry from room to room \u2014 there is no trace of her. Snow has been falling ; there are prints of her light foot down the garden path to the river's unguarded brink, but no Grace 1 The guests disperse in confusion. Henry Smyth and Matthew Farrales are left together in their desolation. The river ! Was that in Grace's thought when she said she must release herself ? What would not either man give to undo the doings, to unsay the sayings of that Christmas Eve ! Christmas Day ; the bells ringing out for service, glad faces in the streets. Yet a search going on every seeker feels to be hopeless. A kerchief seen in the hands of Mistress Grace over night found floating far down the Wear ! Two men, in the abject agony of remorse, accuse themselves of goading their best-beloved to desperation and suicide ! * * * * * Christmas bells are pealing from Heselden steeple ! Pealing for a bridal. A boat, with carol singers on board, had borne away the feet which left their prints upon the snowy ground. A warm arm enfolded the fugitive Grace, warm words and lips reassured her, whilst four stout arms pulled at the oars to a landing place where horses were in readiness. On, past Gillygate* church, on, through the shade of Pelaw's tangled wood, through Old Durham ; on, along highway and byeway, over moor and hill, Grace on a pillion behind her lover, well guarded by his servants in the rear. On, without pause, to Heselden church ! The church open, the priest in waiting, Grace Smyth knelt down before the altar with Kobert Maire, to be raised and borne thence to Hardwick, the proud wife of a proud husband. And the Christmas bells rang merrily in Heselden, if they tolled dolefully in Durham. To all entreaties for forgiveness the indignant father turned a deaf ear. That she had married without his consent was in itself an unpardonable offence ; but to steal from his house at dead of night and roam the country with strange men was an outrage * Now Gilesgate."], [112, "100 THE PURITAN'S WILL. on all decency. Robert Maire he stigmatised as a profligate,' a child of Satan, a midnight robber ; and even went so far as to question the fact of her marriage. The registry of Heselden soon set this beyond debate. To Matthew Farrales the second shock was greater than the first. Rather would he have known her sleeping beneath the cold waters of the Wear than in the arms of another. Yet he bore her no ill-will ; acknowledged her right to marry where she loved; and out of the depths of his own love he found excuses for Robert Maire. He was magnanimous enough even to interfere with Master Smyth in behalf of the young couple ; and in process of time might have effected a reconciliation, but for an event so strange it has been chronicled in history. The disappointments of private life have a tendency to convert extreme religionists into fiery zealots. - - Bigotry is peculiar to no creed, and, as a learned divine has said \u2014 \" orthodoxy is my doxy, heterodoxy is your doxy,\" all the world over. No sooner did Elizabeth's proclamation against Popish emissaries ring throughout the land than the Puritans (themselves under ban, and liable to fine and imprisonment) rushed foremost into the van of persecutors. When the Queen's commissioners reached Durham, Master Henry Smyth came forward to throw the weight of his legal acumen on the side of the Crown, and Master Farrales brought his local knowledge and influence to bear in the hunt after suspected persons. Fletewode, in his report to my Lord Burleigh, states that \" searchers for priests are often so rude and barbarous that if the dores be not opened on the instant when they would enter they break them open with violence, as if in the sack of an enemy's town. Then the pursuivants run up the stairs, and into chambers with drawn swords to frighten women and children into fits.\" Spies and informers are never to seek. Simon Lumley' s time for revenge had come, and it took a subtle shape. In the presence of zealous Master Smyth and Master Farrales, he accused Robert Maire, of Hardwick, of harbouring a seminary priest from abroad, well knowing his office and errand. There was a malignant light in his eye, as he saw the two officials quail at the intelligence. Well the informer knew that love of Mistress Grace lay deep in the hearts of both, and that, though the tree had been torn away, the roots were still left quivering."], [113, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 101 There was no evading the painful duty thrust upon them. To hold back now would but bring suspicion on themselves, and serve the runaway no whit. The claims of religion and loyalty were paramount. So to their task the appointed searchers went, Matthew Farrales hoping against hope that the accusation was false, and that he might in some degree restrain the violence of the pursuivants. There he was foiled by Simon Lumley, who, liberal in his new-born zeal, plied every man with ale or sack, and having spurred them on in secret, left a drunken crew to burst into Hard wick House, and outrage humanity in the very wantonness of brutality. Women ran hither and thither, pursued by the drunken soldiery as they fled ; the privacy of no room was respected ; and when, in an upper chamber, they found a sick man in bed, worn and haggered from recent exposure, they hauled him forth, gagged and pinioned him, and then laid hands on the master of the house. Grace shrieked, and clung to her husband ; but resistance was worse than useless. She was left fainting on the floor, and he was dragged roughly away, and with his fellow-prisoner, Edmund Duke, mounted on horses from his own stables, driven like a felon to the tolbooth in Durham Market Place, and thence to the gaol in the North Gate, there to await their trial before the Court of Aldermen and the Queen's Commissioners. CHAPTER IV. Master Robert Maire was not a poor man. Then, Matthew Farrales, with the magnanimity of a hero, privately sought out evi dence for, not against, his successful rival. So it was proved upon the trial that on the fourth of March a foreign vessel, dismasted and disabled, fiercely driven before the winds, had gone to pieces on the rocky coast some half-mile from Hardwick. That the man Edmund Duke, after long buffetting with the waves, contrived to reach the shore, wounded, spent, and exhausted. That the crowd of cotters and farmers drawn thither to witness the wreck were more on the alert for the spoils of tempest than ready to succour the shipwrecked man. That Robert Maire, utterly ignorant who or what the half-clad sufferer might be, had in Christian charity bade his servants convey him to his home, where Grace, proving herself worthy of her name, had employed her skill in simples to recruit his wasted strength. That, being supposed a foreigner, Master Maire and his"], [114, "102 THE PURITAN'S WILL. helpmate had conversed with him in Latin, and that being noised abroad, Simon Lumley's eager ears had caught the echoes. So, the Court of Aldermen (knowing well Robert Maire's religious faith, and the relations between himself and their eminent coadjutor, the Puritan lawyer), unable to prove more than an act of common charity, graciously released him from durance. But for that deed of humanity he was amerced in the sum of fifty pounds, a considerable sum in those days. Edmund Duke, the shipwrecked man, was indubitably proved to be one of the missionary priests under ban, and had been educated at Douay and Rheims. That he had been flung upon the coast was held to be the righteous vengeance of God upon his mission. Accordingly he was condemned (together with three other priests, Richard Hill, John Hogge, and Richard Holliday) to be executed by the common hangman at the gallows beyond Flambard's Gate (Framwellgate) close by Drawdon Burn. Moreover, Master Robert Maire was commanded, under pain of imprisonment, to be present at the execution, as a monitory lesson for the future. It was the sixth of May, 1591. The day was bright and cheering, the sun shone on mill and burn, the surrounding forest trees wore spring's fresh green livery, above a carpet of hyacinth and bracken. It shone, too, on four hideous wooden frames, each pointing its solitary gaunt arm to the deep Valley of Death ; and it might be \u2014 who knows ? \u2014 also to the Waters of Life beyond. A surging crowd was gathered there ; pikemen and halberdiers guarded the platform, where stood the executioner and his victims, the constable of the gaol and other officials, amongst whom were Master Smyth and Master Farrales. Women, too, were there, eager and excited by the hideous spectacle they had pressed to witness \u2014 \" execution \" for political or religious offences then meaning more than mere hanging ; it rarely happened that dis memberment and disembowelling were not included in the sentence. And there, too, stood Grace, clinging to her husband's arm as if afraid he should again be torn from her. She had but recently risen from the sick bed into which she had been thrown by the violence which wrenched her husband from her arms ; and she looked far too pale and delicate to be there. Robert had just been restored to her from the foulness of a prison, from the grip of an iniquitous law, and no argument was strong enough to induce her to part from him during his enforced presence at the gallows' foot."], [115, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 103 \" Where thou art forced to be, sweetheart, by cruel men, thy wife must also be of her own will. I will not blench to shame thee,\" she had said. It was a strange place on which to meet her offended father for the first time since she had left him. Yet there they met, and there, touched perhaps by her wan and shuddering aspect, her appealing eyes, and the trembling clasp of her dear one's arm, he accorded a sort of dubious forgiveness. It was a horrid spectacle for a sensitive woman ; but the firm ness of the four priests, and the constancy with which they accepted torture rather than recantation, gave to that holocaust an air of martyrdom, and in two minds at least produced an impression never contemplated by the functionaries of the State. Edmund Duke was the last to suffer. Barely had his limbs ceased to quiver, when a shout rent the air, \" A miracle ! a miracle ! A dry burn ! a dry burn !\" It was even so. Two parched spectators, going thither to slake their thirst, rushed back with the strange news that Drawdon Burn had run diy, and the cry went up as from one voice. Drawdon Burn dry ? That leaping, bounding, flowing stream dry ? That stream dry which had laughed defiance to the strongest summer sun ? Incredible ! Matthew Farrales was not the only one who left the executioner to finish his ghastly work, and ran to satisfy doubt. Young and old pressed forward in a mass, and soon the motley crowd grouped amongst the trees which had kept the burn in shadow, stood looking alternately into each other's faces and down the banks into the bed of the burn \u2014 dry, save for a thin line of limpid silver trickling amongst the yet moist stones, and growing perceptibly thinner. The crowd was dispersing when Matthew Farrales, standing in perplexity at the foot of the burn, and pondering the possibility of a return of the water, became conscious of the evil face of Simon Lumley peering at him curiously from the opposite bank. \" Aha ! Master Farrales ; what think you of this judgment upon you ? How will the fulling-mill work with a dry burn ? \u2014 a dry burn, aha ! aha ! It is my turn to laugh now.\" The water never returned. The marvel or the miracle of the dry burn spread through the county, and people coming to satisfy curiosity, so often asked their way to the \" Dryburn,\" that the old name lapsed, and Dryburn superseded Drawdon. But more lapsed than the name of an estate. Master Robert Maire and Mistress Grace his wife, the staunch Protestant and the Puritan's daughter, lapsed in their faith ! Whether in consequence"], [116, "104 THE PURITAN'S WILL. of the persecution he had undergone, the dawning hope blighted in the shock sustained by Grace, the constancy and firmness of the priests under execution, the miracle of the dried-up burn, or the subtle sophistries of Father Duke, cannot be known. Possibly all combined. At all events Roman Catholicism had two more professors, and the old Puritan in Silver Street wept bitter tears over the recusants. This second loss of his daughter was worse than the first. The forgiveness accorded at the priests' execution was retracted, and there was no hope of pardon now. With him she was \" Graceless Grace \" to the end of his days. It was noted, however, that his zeal in the prosecution of Papists gradually diminished, and when Robert Maire was com pelled to pay \u00a32,0 a month as a recusant, he took no part with those inflicting the heavy fine. The fulling mill, a wooden erection, went to decay, and Matthew Farrales \u2014 stung by the defection of Grace, as by her rejection of himself \u2014 a broken-hearted man, persecuted for his Puritanism (at the instigation of Simon Lumley), much as he had persecuted the Papists, found in 1595 a purchaser for Drawdon or Dryburn in one Richard Hutchinson, and went over with scores of others to Holland. He was said to be afterwards one of that band of Pilgrim Fathers who, sailing in the Mayflower from Delft harbour, found in distant Virginia that \" freedom to worship God \" which England refused. Ere he left England he sent a few words of farewell and con solation to Grace, then mourning the loss of her third child William, a baby boy, buried with scant ceremony in Heselden churchyard at midnight, as the son of recusants. In the loss of her child Grace learned to feel for her father left desolate in his old age, more solitary than ever when his friend Matthew went away. She would fain have gone to him, and on her knees- besought his pardon, but Master Maire, resolute as Master Smyth, and crediting him with much that he endured for his new creed, would hear no word of compromise. Father and daughter never met again, and he renounced her. Portly Hannah Heaviside was not without hope that the lonely lawyer might be won over to solace himself for the loss of his graceless daughter by taking unto himself a wife, herself being that individual. With this view she fostered rather than soothed his irritation against Mistress Maire, and made her own hopes very apparent. How effectively, her exclusion from his will proved. That will was dated July 20th, 1598, and though he lived until"], [117, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 105 November, it was never revoked. In it he gave all his coal-mines of the yearly value of \u00a3100, besides a personal estate worth \u00a3100 more, to the City of Durham, after this wise : \u2014 \" And as touchiug my colemynes and the increase thereof may be employed for the benefit of many I freely give them to the City of Durham, and the cause why I do so, and further as followeth, is, that some good trade may be devised for setting of the youth and other idle per sons to work, as shall be thought convenient, whereby some profit may arise to the benefit of the said city, and relief of those that are past work. As for my daughter, Graceless Grace, who I, nor any of her kindred, have seen for divers years past, I will that there be paid her \u00a320 by year, for my terme out of colepitt's, if she live so long, after \u00a35 the quarter by those that have the cole pitts either Michaelmas or Christmas as the quarter shall fall out, but yet upon this condicion that she fetch every quarter payment herself or within one month after. And also that she come to the cathedral church of Durham to the sermon in dewe time or els to lose that quarter, except some great cause be a lett, then to give it her the next quarter, that she cometh to the sermon, or \u25a0els to loose it.\" Only \u00a3100 to Grace, his child, and that coupled with such harsh conditions, and so much in charity. Was it charity ? No matter, the City of Durham gained by the Puritan's will whatever Grace less Grace lost. And lose she did, even the legacy ; for Master Robert Maire loved his wife dearly, and had a proud spirit, so he would not permit her to abase herself by going to either Edmund Wanless the dyer, or William Hall the draper, or the Alderman (pro tem pore) who were his executors, for the pittance so left to her. Nor would he suffer her to \" conform,\" as it was called, by attending the stipulated services at the Cathedral. \" Nay, Grace,\" said he ; \" if I could pay the fines thy Puritan father had a hand in. laying as a burthen on my shoulders, I need not subject thee to the scoff of a draper and dyer for a pitiful hundred pounds. And now that severity is less rigid, and our penalties overlooked, there is less cause.\" Years went by. Another Christmas came, fierce and stormy and blustering. The forest trees surrounding Hardwick mansion writhed and groaned, and flung about their bare arms wildly to the shrieking gale. Snow lay on the ground, and was driven in showers before the wind, filling up nooks and hollows to a treacherous level. At sea the winds ran riot. On the shore the -waves raced in white with foam, and roared like monsters for their prey."], [118, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 106 Indoors, fires blazed and evergreens glistened, dancing feet tripped over rush-strewn floors, and wine and wassail crowned the feast. Without, a stout ship battled with the billows, spars and cordage fringed with icicles, its deck one slippery sheet. ' The hurricane and billows tossed it, beat it, rent it, as it drove in shore, and cast its helpless crew into the seething flood with scarce a hope of rescue. See, along the Hardwick c'oast, Robert Maire and his three stalwart sons, Thomas, John, and Andrew (no Henry), with a troop of servants bearing torches and ropes, have left the festive hall at the sound of distress, and put forth all their energies to save the drow-ning mariners. With infinite danger to themselves, the brave young men succeed in rescuing three seamen from the greedy waves ; the last, a man of mature age, having a broken limb. Forgetting, or ignoring, all he had suffered in consequence of a similar act, Master Maire had the poor fellows carried straight to his hospitable hall. Mistress Grace, as heretofore, helped with head and hands to restore the benumbed and exhausted sufferers. Placed in warm beds, and soothed with possets, two revived to bless their preservers. The third was past all help. The damps of death were on his forehead, but even in his agony he heard the noble couple call each other \" Grace \" and \" Robert ;\" and looking in their faces, said, \" I know you now, Mistress Maire. I am Simon Lumley, and this is retribution \u2014 retribution ! Know you not it was I who caused youi bridegroom to be dragged to gaol for sheltering such a poor wretch as I myself am now.\" \" You \u2014 not Matthew Farrales !\" \" No, by my faith, no.\" \" And wherefore ? We had done thee no wrong, man !\" said Robert, sternly. \" Wherefore ! Jealousy, envy, revenge, all evil passions were at work.\" And then he made confession in penitential gasps, extorted from him by remorse. Only the hand of God could have thus thrown him, shipwrecked and dying, on the bed whence he had dragged from the same roof that other shipwrecked man, and his benevolent preserver \u2014 the one to death. \" Mistress Maire, I, Simon Lumley, watched you oft in blooming youth pass by my gate with Master Smyth to Matthew Farrales' home. I saw you with him, saw he loved you, and in the very impotence of hopelessness, I hated him for the chance he had, and I had not. In my blind rage I strove to baulk him of the fulling-mill, and as thou knowest lost"], [119, "THE PURITAN'S WILL. 107 my cause. Then my fury had another object, thy father ; but I bided my time. When Bobert Maire bore thee away, I hated him for that ; he had won what I would have perilled my soul for, and did. But the misery of Master Farrales and his lawyer was a feast of joy to me. On the day that the four priests went to the gallows, Drawdon burn ran dry ! ' A miracle !' the people shouted. ' A miracle,' I too, called. 'Miracle,' it was devilry, no miracle. I wrought craftily, stealthily. Months before I had tracked the burn up through the forest to its source, and there, slowly working at intervals, in secret, oft by night, dug a fresh channel for the stream to swell another burn not far away. I bided my time. When all the folk were at the hanging, I broke the barriers down. The waters fell into the new course, and by the time I showed my face in the crowd there was a dry burn for Matthew Farrales' fulling-mill. I had my revenge. It was short-lived ; judgment fell on me. The next year, the year of the great drought, * when a horseman rode across the shrunken Thames at London Bridge, wells and brooks on my own farm dried up ; the crops were burnt up, my cattle died, I was im- poverished ; still I struggled on, and dug my spurs into Matthew Farrales' Puritanic sides. He sold Dryburn to Bichard Hutchinson, and two years later the plague came to my farm, and bore away the only being that loved me \u2014 my sister. I, too, sold my farm to Master Hutchinson. He holds both now. In Sunderland the press-gang pounced upon me \u2014 and here I am. Mistress Grace \u2014 my life is paying for the evil I wrought.. But remember there was no miracle! Forgive me \u2014 oh, forgive.\" On Christmas Day, there lay under the Hardwick roof the corpse of their only enemy \u2014 and, for the sake of the Founder of Christmas, they forgave him. Charitable in all things. In 1612, King James I. ordereda \" commission of pious uses.\" These commissioners, Bishop Hutton being one, called the tardy executors of \" Smyth's Charity \" to accjunt. They were found to have in their hands ready cash, \u00a3577 10s. 6d., which was at once transferred to a chest with four locks, and lodged in the Town Chamber with all bonds and securities. Then New Place (the old Seville Palace) was bought, and made into a cloth working factory, where poor children were taught the trade. But it did not flourish long. In time even the collieries failed, and \" Smyth's Charity \" dwindled to a shadow. Can it be that anger, not charity, prompted the bequest, and no blessing rested on the Puritan's Will ? *See \"Baker's Chronicles.\""], [120, "THE TWO VALENTINES. \" February Fill-dyke, turn up either black or white,\" observed my senior partner, Jeremiah Poole, as we left our warehouse in Wood-street, after business, in the midst of a steady downpour, which would have cleared any streets but those of London. \" It has turned up black enough this year,\" I appended snappishly, as a dripping umbrella encountered mine at the corner of Cheapside, and sprinkled my face with a gratuitous baptism. \"Ah, well, it is only seasonable,\" philosophically remarked Jeremiah, with his foot on the step of his brougham, \" and to be regarded as one of the minor ills of life, unless it should continue long enough to affect trade ; then I own it might become serious. Good-day, Crompton.\" He was whirled away, and I plodded on resolutely towards my club, in a mood as disagreeable as the weather. He had referred to the rain, but to me the blackness with which February opened had another and deeper signification. I had made an involuntary mistake, and was paying, as I thought, more than a sufficient penalty. Mr. Poole and his family \u2014 wife, son, and two daughters \u2014 occupied a staringly new modern villa at Crouch End, and within a quarter of a mile my Uncle Marbury and my Cousin Bessy lived in an old unconventional cottage on the crest of the hill, to which he had been attracted after his wife's death by a large and marvellously well-cultivated garden, so planned as to seem doubly extensive by embowered walks winding in and out towards the furthest end ; to say nothing of the ivy, shrubs, and evergreens which hid the walls, or of the fine cedar spread out over the lawn. Of all Uncle Marbury's eight children, only Bessy, the youngest (I call her Best, for she was best and brightest), remained to cheer his widowed home. The others had married or dis persed ; and as link after link was broken from the family chain, as face after face disappeared from the breakfast-table and the drawing-room, the old house in Gower-street seemed to grow bigger and gloomier ; and when Aunt Marbury died the chill of a mausoleum crept into it. Even Bessy drooped in its shadow. Two years previously my uncle, then a"], [121, "109 THE TWO VALENTINES. hale man of some sixty-seven years, had retired from the firm in Wood-street, leaving a portion of his capital as an invest ment, and myself, his dead sister's son, as junior partner.. I was young for the position, barely twenty-three, but so he had willed it, and so it came to be. Sam Poole, the son, was brought in about the time my uncle was induced by old memories of a country life (and a bit of diplomacy between myself and Jeremiah) to exchange the gloomy old house in Gower-street for the cottage at Crouch End. Then the firm became Poole, Crompton, and Poole. Business, however, had not had time to indurate me. The romance of life yet clung to- my heart, and I think dear Best had helped to keep it warm with her winning ways and cousinly affection. At this time Bessy was a supple yet well-rounded maiden of eighteen, of middle height, with delicately small feet and hands, ears like pinky shells, an oval face, lips that parted with smiles, and showed how white and even were the small teeth behind them. Her eyes of the clearest hazel could dance with glee or flash with indignation ; and there was a slight curve in the nostril of her shapely nose which showed her quick to move. Touch her cheeks gently with a tint of rose, and crown her with light-brown hair, which sunbeams fleck with threads of gold, and you have Bessy Marbury's portrait from a very inadequate limner, before successive changes in their home crushed the energies of the old man, and cast an impalpable veil over the young girl too. I soon saw that empty rooms and empty hours combined with heavy furniture and a dingy outlook to exercise a baleful influence on both, and loving them well I set about the remedy. First I induced Bessy to lighten the sombre hue of her mourning, so as to be a less dismal reminder to her father. Then I ventured to open the long-closed piano, and let my own feelings loose on it3 keys. Then I convinced Bessy that music from herself would be more consolatory to my uncle than his own brooding thoughts ; and as she played I watched the grey head lifted from the bowed hands, and though the face never turned round from the fire, I knew that he listened. Next I won him to talk of my mother and his boyhood in a country home, and at length, as if struck by a sudden thought, I said : \" How much you must have surrendered, Uncle Marbury, when you shut yourself up in a city warehouse the best years of your life ! \" \"Indeed I did, Robert \u2014 indeed I did ! \" echoed he. \"I am"], [122, "110 THE TWO VALENTINES. not sure now if the golden buttercups were not worth more than the golden guineas, after all,\" and he looked round the sombre room with a sigh. For a few days I kept away, leaving the dropped seeds to germinate. I must have been missed, since before the week was out Uncle Marbury came down to the counting-house for the first time since he had been a widower, as he said, \"just to see what had become of me.\" It was early summer : Mr. Poole and Sam had flowers in their button-holes fresh from their own garden. Uncle noticed them, and this gave Jeremiah an opportunity to descant on the glories of the season, and to wind up with an earnest invitation to his late partner to visit the villa at Crouch End, in order to bring roses back to Miss Bessy's cheeks, where he had heard lilies made too much display. The invitation was accepted, and when Mr. Poole suggested that he should meet them at the station, Sam struck in officiously, \" Oh, Crompton will drive them over ; he'll only be too glad to do it ! \" I must have looked somewhat disconcerted, for my uncle's quick, keen glance was followed by agrumpish \" H'm,\" peculiar to himself when not over satisfied. He, however, took me off with him ; we hailed a cab in Cheapside, and I dined with him and Bessy, to my intense satisfaction I know, and I was vain enough to think to theirs also. Bessy had been too much isolated from companions of her own age. As we sat over our dessert, and spoke of the proposed visit, I grew eloquent in praise of the Misses Poole, just to create an interest in them. I am afraid I overdid my part in my desire to bring Best into contact with fresh young hearts. A glimmering of this crossed my mind as Uncle Marbury said drily, while filling his claret glass : ' ' A Parisian school must have worked wonders if it has made Fanny Poole all you say. She was little more than a romp when I saw her last.\" \" She is nothing of the romp now, uncle,\" I replied ; \" you will find her very engaging.\" Bessy rose to leave the room, and I thought, but it might have been fancy, that her lip trembled as she said lightly : \" I hope I shall find Miss Fanny as fascinating as Robert thinks her.\" There was no fancy, however, in the tremulous tones in which, after putting out her hand to say \" Good-night,\" she whispered to my ear only :"], [123, "111 THE TWO VALENTINES. \" Is Fanny Poole really so very charming ? \" I think I pressed the little hand with more warmth than usual as I answered in like tones : \" Not half so charming as my Cousin Best ; \" and I know I dropped a more than cousinly kiss on her white forehead as I went away. The visit to Crouch End was most satisfactory. A feminine friendship was cemented ere three days were gone ; and before their stay expired the cottage on the hill was taken, and various improvements planned. So far all had gone to my intense satisfaction. Uncle had thrown into gardening the remains of the energy which had made his modest fortune in trade ; yet not a flower in the garden bloomed like beautiful Bessy. But I soon began to discover that Crouch End was not so accessible as Gower-street, and that neither my club nor my bachelor lodgings in Canonbury sufficed to fill my evenings. Still, I contrived to run down once or twice a week, and I generally found myself in the train on a Saturday afternoon, to be in readiness to take Bess to church on Sunday morning. If I failed Uncle Marbury was sure to take me to task, and Bessy to look a rebuke stronger than words. And this did happen once or twice about the time when the dahlias were making way for chrysanthemums and Michaelmas daisies, and I grew piqued and splenetic, for no better reason than the strengthened intimacy between the Pooles and Marburys, and Sam's superior facilities for making himself agreeable to Bessy, if he felt so inclined. That he did feel so inclined I gathered from Ms frequent encomiums of my \" charming cousin.\" Cousin, indeed ! As if I had not appropriated Best to myself years before I had discovered there were stronger and dearer bonds than cousinship. That discovery I had made before the removal to Cedar Lodge, and from certain inexpressible signs I was led to think Best had made it likewise. I had not thought it necessary to make an open declaration to her, so assured was I that we were drifting smoothly and pleasantly towards the shores of matrimony with the full approbation of my uncle. Sam's confounded admiration of Best somewhat shook my equanimity, and I began to fear that I had assumed too much. For the first time I began to doubt the force of my own personal attractions. If I was a well-made, good-looking fellow, so was Sam, and it was just possible his tawny hair and Piccadilly weepers might be as irresistible as my own crisp black curls and beard."], [124, "112 THE TWO VALENTINES. I need not tell anyone who has been deeply in love how I tortured myself ; nor how, after a hasty resolve to rush off to Crouch End, and put an end to my doubts, I grew scared with my own impetuosity, then timid, and concluded on watching the twain together before I made a fool of myself. I am afraid I made myself particularly disagreeable about this time, and began to accuse my darling Best of fitful humours. At all events, Christmas came with its festivities, and I was no nearer assurance of Bessy's undivided love. More than once I had gone to the cottage, determined to ascertain my fate, and had been baulked by the everlasting presence of Sam and his sisters ; and then, to avoid betraying my irritation, made a simpleton of myself by trifling with Miss Fanny, who was an arrant flirt. There were parties at both houses in honour of the season. That at Cedar Lodge was the first given by Uncle Marbury since his wife's death ; and for a week previously I had the pleasure of hearing Sam dilate on the assistance he had given Bessy in decorating the drawing-room with festoons of evergreens for the occasion. This drawing-room embraced nearly the whole width of the cottage, curving out with a sweep into the fine garden, to which the middle window was a glass door. It was in this room I made my first blunders. Stung by Sam's easy confidence, I went thither to prick my fingers with holly, and prick my heart, too, with futile efforts to get Bessy to myself for half an hour. Trains are imperative, and I came away leaving Sam Poole mounted on a ladder, and Bessy handing up to him the wreaths we had been making. The next day I betook myself to Covent Garden to make choice of a bouquet, and to a jeweller's for a holder. These I packed carefully, enclosing a letter telling the story of my hopes and fears, and begging her, if she desired to make me happy, to wear my bouquet on the forthcoming occasion. I was in ecstacy. I believe I shook hands with cousins big and little, and gave Uncle Marbury a special grip ; but I saw nothing and nobody but Bessy \u2014 \" my Bessy,\" as I told myself, for in her priceless hand was my bouquet held as something precious. She looked absolutely lovely, and radiant with delight. Her mourning had been thrown aside. A robe of white crape over silk, looped here and there with pearls, floated like a film around her ; and save a tiny cluster of scarlet exotics on her breast, other ornament she had none. Her colour rose, and her eyelids drooped as I clasped her"], [125, "113 THE TWO VALENTINES. disengaged hand and whispered impressively, in tones too low to reach other ears, \"My Bessy!\" She said not a word. I think she could not with so many eyes upon us ; but I felt the little fingers clasp closely on mine, and took that for an answer. Still I longed for something more. Time had been I would have taken Best under the mistletoe, and with a conscious licence kissed her boldly amongst them all. Now, I was too self-conscious for that. The cottage was not large, and every room was invaded. The conservatory was only to be reached by a long corridor on the floor above, swarming with servants and children ; and children seemed to cluster round Bessy like flies round a jar of honey. To approach her was difficult. Privacy was out of the question. It was quite a family gathering, but the Pooles were there, of course, and with them a Miss Minton, a quiet, statuesque girl in amber silk and jet, to whom Jeremiah was guardian. I had heard Sam speak of her, but more as an unfathomable mystery than anything else. For the sake of the children, whom I wished at the Antipodes, games took precedence of dances ; but whatever was done, Sam always seemed to come between me and Bessy, and I was left to the mercy of the lively Miss Fanny, who took possession of me without scruple. I had managed, however, to engage Bessy for the first waltz. Many a time and oft had we whirled round together in other rooms to the same measure, but now as my arm encircled her for the first time as my own, an electric thrill ran through me, which will live in my memory until death. I felt her tremble on my shoulder, I saw love in the tender light of the eyes which answered mine ; and, intoxicated with my new happiness, my clasp tightened with the sense of possession. Under cover of the music, the buzz, and the whirl, I contrived to whisper an impassioned word or two, and to solicit the scarlet flower from her bosom as a Crash ! \u2014 a magnificent vase is lying in fragments on the floor, and the urchin who has done the mischief is struggling and screaming in a passion of terror and temper with his mamma and grandpa Marbury, who alike threaten corporal punishment. \" You would not, surely, punish Willy for an accident, Eleanor ! \" cried Bessy, darting from my arms to the scene of disaster to carry the resisting little imp beyond the reach of summary justice. Willy's screams, to which distance did not \"lend enchantment,\" were not easily subdued ; and I was about to follow Bessy with I"], [126, "114 THE TWO VALENTINES. the avowed purpose of trying my suasive powers, when my steps were arrested by the light tap of a fan upon my shoulder. I turned to confront Fanny Poole in her most \\ivacious mood. Her eyes absolutely sparkled with mischief. \" Nay, Mr. Crompton, an extemporised nursery is hardly the place for young gentlemen above a certain age. Neither your cousin nor the maids will thank you for intrusion in their domain ; and I rather think you owe me suit and service as partner for the Caledonians, and you see the set is forming.\" With an apology, I tendered my arm, and we joined the dancers. I am afraid I watched the door too closely to be very attentive to my partner ; but she chatted for both of us, and in the pauses of the dance beset me with badinage, which constrained attention and repartee. Bessy had not returned when I led Miss Fanny to her seat on an ottoman in one of the windows, where she still detained me to champion her against her staid sister's animadversions on her frivolity. I was doing so, with my heart elsewhere, when Sam Poole sauntered into the room ; and, as I live, the scarlet flower Bessy had promised me was in his buttonhole ! I could have crushed it and him ! I must have gone white, and I know something like a groan escaped me. \" Are you ill, Mr. Crompton ? \" asked Fanny, soberly, in real concern. \" You must be,\" she persisted, disregarding my nega tion ; \"quite a change has come over your face.\" I laughed it off, but she looked keenly at me as if unconvinced. I had now no wish to move. Presently Bessy came back, a sort of timid flutter on her countenance and in her manner as she glanced around. The scarlet flower was gone from her bodice, there could be no mistake ! As her hazel eyes met mine a smile lit them up, but it faded as instantaneously in the stern look of mine. I might have crossed over to her and asked for an explanation, but my evil genius, the jealous demon that had held me in its grip of late, urged me to solicit Fanny's ready hand for the Redowa. Almost at the same moment Sam crossed to Bessy, who was standing with her father and Mr. Poole on the hearth, and they followed suit. If I was tender with Bessy, I was buoyant with Fanny, and I flirted with her to her heart's content. Some one \u2014 I think it was my cousin Eleanor \u2014 observed to Miss Minton, \" It appears as if there were two weddings on the tapis. Do you not think the couples fairly matched ? \""], [127, "115 THE TWO VALENTINES. \"Indeed I do not,\" answered Miss Minton, with quiet decision and an immobile face. In spite of dance and partner, my eyes and ears were strained and sensitive that night. At an early hour I framed an excuse for leaving. \" Not stay supper, Robert ! \" exclaimed Uncle Marbury ; \" Miss Fanny and Bessy will be in despair.\" \" Ah, woman's despair,\" I replied cynically, as I put on my overcoat. \" I have forgotten letters of importance to write and post in town before I sleep. You can make my apologies and adieus after I am gone.\" I knew that \" business \" was the only excuse that would pass muster with hospitable Uncle Marbury, but I need scarcely say the \" letters \" were mythic. On the plea of indisposition, I remained away from business for more than a w*eek. Had I encountered Sam Poole, I should surely have knocked him down, and come to a rupture that would have dissolved our partnership, and broken my good uncle's heart ; and reason told me that Sam was not to blame. He held no clue to my attachment, and it was no fault of his that Bessy was lovable, or that I, like a fool, had thrown her in his way. Nor was my illness altogether feigned. The mind, acting on the body, unfitted me for business and free communion with a successful rival \u2014 for such must Sam be without question. The good -hearted fellow came to Canonbury ; but my orders had been given, and he did not see me. Then Uncle Marbury came ; and went away to send me his physician, and to frighten Bessy, who he said had taken my abrupt departure and illness very much to heart. Convinced that my cowardice was unmanly, I nerved myself to brave the worst, and to hide my disappointment as best I could. Sam's cordial grasp of my hand and his hearty exclama- tion as he jumped from his seat in the counting-house to greet me, told more forcibly than words that he had no design in ousting me. Jeremiah said I had altered very much in the ten days, and hoped I had not come out too soon. I stuck to business all that week and the next under pretence of making up for lost time, spending my Sunday in town. But when the second Saturday came, I had no pretence sound enough to keep me longer from my Uncle Marbury's. If Bessy had deceived me, or I had deceived myself, I had no right to trouble the good old man, who loved me as a son, with the sad know ledge. Yet, I confess, I loitered over dressing, glad of any delay. I"], [128, "116 THE TWO VALENTINES. drew on leisurely an overcoat I had not worn since that miserable night at Crouch End. Putting my cigar-case (one Bessy had embroidered into the inner breast-pocket, it encountered some obstruction. I drew forth an envelope containing something which had stained the paper, and did not lie flat. \" Cousin Robert \" was pencilled on the outside. I trembled as I tore it open, and a shower of scarlet petals fluttered to the ground. Bessy's scarlet flower, crushed and broken, lay within. There was also on a small slip of paper, hastily traced in pencil : \"My dear Robert, \u2014 Naughty, fractious Willy has torn the flower I promised you to bits. I know you will value it just as well as if it were perfect, and so I have collected every atom. I put it in your coat pocket lest I should not have a chance of giving it you unobserved, and I dread Fanny Poole's raillery. \" Your Bessy.\" A perfumed note had come to me from Bessy during my seclusion, and in my temper I had thrust it into the fire unread. What would I not have given to be able to collect its very ashes now ? I rained kisses on the senseless paper in my hand, and kneeling, collected every faded petal as carefully as my darling Bessy had done. I called a hansom from the rank by Canonbury Tower, and bribed the driver to drive me in double-quick time to King's Cross. I could scarcely wait for the train, so impatient was I to make amends to my love for the pain my mad jealousy must have caused her. Luckily I had a first-class carriage to myself, and could indulge my transports unobserved. It was growing dusk when I turned the handle of the unfastened door of Cedar Lodge, and stepped, unannounced, into the parlour to my uncle, who, with his slippered feet on the fender-stool and spectacles on nose, was vainly endeavouring to decipher the Gardener's Magazine in the waning light. After a somewhat flurried greeting, to my inquiries for Bessy my uncle answered : \" You will find her somewhere about.\" The hall door and the drawing-room door faced each other at opposite ends of the passage, and the glass door-window was also in a direct line. Consequently, the drawing-room door being open, I caught the outlines of a grey dress and pensively drooped head, just under the still-suspended mistletoe. Her face was towards the garden. No doubt she was musing on the inconstancy and incomprehensibility of man. Without pause or word I rushed forward over the thick Turkey"], [129, "117 THE TWO VALENTINES. carpet, caught the girl in my arms, and kissed her passionately, before I became aware that I held Fanny Poole, not Bessy, in my embrace. Fanny's surprise equalled my consternation ; but she recovered her equanimity first, and then, in a spirit of torment, affected to treat it as a genuine outburst of affection towards herself, to be resented with the petulance of a capricious maiden towards her lover. As she wilfully misconstrued my stammering apology, fettered as it was with my fear of compromising Bessy, I became conscious that Bessy herself stood in the doorway, with compressed white lips and quivering nostrils. The anguish of that moment is inconceivable. I rushed towards her with an appealing gesture, and the one word \" Bessy ! \" burst as from my very heart. She quietly and with dignity waved me back. \" I seek no explanation, Robert. I have seen and heard enough \u2014 before to-day.\" She retraced her steps along the hall and up the staircase to her own chamber, for I heard the door close overhead. Fanny Poole looked little less distressed than I. \"Mr. Crompton,\" said she, gravely, but kindly, \" believe me, I had no idea of this. I fear my irrepressible love of fun may have done unintentional mischief. What I can do to repair \" \" You have driven me mad with your folly,\" I cried, bitterly ; and dashed from the room and the house without even a word to my uncle. It was not until afterwards that I blamed my own folly. The days went by without a word from Bessy ; nor did I write to her, since she had refused to hear me on the spot. In little more than a week Uncle Marbury came down to Wood street to ask what was wrong between Bessy and myself, and to take me to task for what he was pleased to call my ungovernable temper. I was chafing and smarting under a concatenation of mischances, and was in no mood to be called to account. I waived explanation, and referred him to my cousin. \" I say, old fellow, what is all this hubbub about at Crouch End ?\" inquired Sam, in our private counting-house, tilting his chair back to have abetter view of my countenance. \"Miss Marbury refuses to see our Fanny, and Fanny is in hysterics, \u25a0and there's the very deuce to pay. I had a notion you were * spoons ' on Fanny ; but \" \" Hang your Fanny ! \" was my discourteous interruption. \" I say, Crompton, be civil. I shan't stand that ! What has"], [130, "118 THE TWO VALENTINES. Fanny done to irritate you ? Do let a fellow know, and have a chance to set it right.\" I saw that he was in earnest, and told him everything \u2014 even to my jealousy of himself. When I spoke of my jealousy at his attentions to Bessy, and the scarlet flower he wore, he smiled. \" Crompton, I am just as madly in love as you are : but with a statue. I was trying to pique Miss Minton to animation \u2014 I might as well have tried to move an iceberg. As for the flower, your Uncle Marbury gave it me himself in his conservatory, and Miss Minton has it now if she has thought it worth preserving.\" Sam undertook to set matters straight without appearing to act under instruction. My pride revolted against direct embassy.. Another week elapsed. Sam had explained the whole case to Uncle Marbury in strict confidence ; but Bessy made no sign. It was at this juncture that I parted from Jeremiah Poole at the corner of Wood-street in the drenching rain, on the twelfth of Februaiy, feeling as if misfortune was pelting me worse than the weather. Changing my mind ere I got into Fleet-street, I turned my back on the club, and bent my steps doggedly homewards, not caring even to call a cab. As I stalked along Islington the almost deserted street left blazing windows exposed, and as I passed shop after shop brilliant with valentines, the thought struck me that I would try the effect of one on my indignant cousin. How many I turned over ere I could select one to my mind it boots not to say. I found one at last, with an emblematic floral bouquet, in an ornamental box within a plain one. I spent half the night in writing and tearing up letters before I could produce one which should satisfy Bessy without stripping me of self-respect. When I had succeeded I placed my missive underneath the valentine in such manner that she must see there was an enclosure, and the next day I posted it, wondering what the men on 'Change would say if my romance were known. The fourteenth went by, the fifteenth came, and with the morning's letters a packet the same size as the one I had sent so Best. The address was in her handwriting, undisguised. I know not what I hoped or feared. I only remember the crushing sensation with which I recognized my own valentine returned ! I did not raise it to examine the enclosure. I saw that it was there ; that was more than enough. With set teeth and a muttered resolve to forswear woman in the future, I thrust the odious thing into a drawer and turned the key viciously."], [131, "119 THE TWO VALENTINES. Week after week went by. I saw nothing of Uncle Marbury ; heard neither from him nor Bessy. I was settling down to business, a moody, disappointed man, evidently growing out of favour with my partners ; but I was careless of that. I began to entertain thoughts of selling out and going to Canada. \" This is a sad affair about Miss Marbury,\" said Sam to me, as we were clearing our desks at closing time. The words struck me like an electric shock. \" For heaven's sake, Sam, what do you mean ?\" \"Mean! Do you not know that she is dangerously ill \u2014 scarcely expected to live ?\" I sank on my chair with a deep groan. Every word was torture. \"I understand she has been fading ever since you returned her valentine,\" continued he, seeing I looked for information. \" What ! \" I inquired, impetuously, starting to my feet in amaze \u2014 \" what 1 \" He repeated his statement. \" Sam, you will drive me mad. I returned no valentine. She it was returned mine, and with it as honest a letter as ever man penned.\" Sam looked mystified. \"I can show you the thing and prove it.\" \" Well, I think I should like to see it,\" quoth my interlocutor, drily. We chartered a cab, and almost in silence nursed our own thoughts till we were landed in Grange-road, where we kept the cab waiting. I unlocked the drawer, and put the valentine before Sam Poole just as I had thrust it out of sight. \" Yes,\" said he, as if to himself \u2014 \" precisely the same. Strange ! \" He lifted his eyes. \" And you have never examined this ? You know these things are made by the gross ?\" A light flashed over me. He lifted the fragile bouquet, and drew forth \u2014 not my letter, but a dainty silken purse, containing a lock of silken hair and a tiny scroll, \" With Bessy's love.\" I dropped my head in my hands on the table, and if tears came do not blame me ; sorrow and self-reproach were at work ; I felt my own hasty judgments lay at the root of all. Once before I had been whirled along the road and rail to Crouch End to seek reconciliation. Heaven grant better success this time ! Sam shook his head. He thought the case more desperate now!"], [132, "120 THE TWO VALENTINES. But Sam was a staunch friend, and the proofs in both hands were conclusive. Before the stars came out I sat with Bessy's wasted form in my arms, her head upon my shoulder, nevermore to part in life. And she did live. And we were married on the next Valentine's Day. Sam was groomsman, and Miss Minton and Fanny bridesmaids. Fanny has been cured of flirtation, and Sam tells me Miss Minton is not an iceberg, but that she did not care to be forced to show her own heart unfairly and unsolicited. And Bessy thinks she was right."], [133, "JOE'S FIRST MARRIAGE. CHAPTER I. I became acquainted with Joe Leeming towards the end of his days, when snarling, crotchety and cynical, he looked back on wasted powers and disappointments, a very wreck driven into port like a weather-beaten ship encrusted with barnacles. Yet I was told this morbid, bitterly-cynical man had once been gay and light-hearted, dressy and dashing, a reckless pleasure-seeker, squandering time, money, health and opportunities with like thoughtless prodigality ; and something in his face and bearing confirmed this. He died at fifty, a prematurely old man. The following episode in his early career was related by a bird of his own feather, in my presence. I give it as a quaint instance of Quaker justice, and as far as possible in the speaker's words : \u2014 \" Ah ! Joe Leeming was a wild fellow in his young days ! By-the-bye, did I ever tell you how he came to marry his first wife ? No ! Then I will tell you now. You are aware that Joe and I were chums at school, but I do not suppose you know that I was pegging away at a desk in Sankey and Son's stifling office, planning impracticable and never- to-be-erected churches and bridges, whilst he underwent a like probation in the employ of Silas and Elkanah Cash, the great Staffordshire ironmasters. The Brothers Cash were Quakers of the old school, and a very good old school it was, notwithstanding the low-crowned, broad brimmed hats, the collarless, broad-tailed drab coats, breeches and gaiters which it enjoined. It enjoined something more than mere outward precision : truth and equity were understood to be indispensable likewise. Indeed, I am not sure but it enjoined a little more, and, as Joe often said, \" expected a fellow to keep everyone of the cardinal virtues buttoned up under his individual vest.\" Family influence no doubt helped Joe into Silas and Elkanah"], [134, "122 joe's first marriage. Cashs' office, but how he contrived to retain his place there is a marvel. They so staid, and he so \u2014 well, Joe was an anomaly all his life \u2014 there must have been some principle of magnetic attraction about him, he made so many friends. But as a mechanical draughtsman he had few compeers, and the shrewd old fellows knew the advantage of keeping such a man in their own hands. Then he had a wonderful fertility of invention which served them more than once, if it failed him at a pinch. But Joe was given to display ; wore coat and continuations o approved cut, neckties and scarfs of the newest fashion, with a legion of breast-pins en suite ; was more than particular about his boots and gloves, and diffused around him the aroma of a bouquet. We had few balls in Walsall, and no theatre, but he patronised both whenever an errand to Birmingham afforded the opportunity. It was rumoured, too, that he had been seen in many places less defensible. It is to be inferred that his graver peccadilloes never reached the ears of the Brothers Cash, for they were not the men to overlook wrong-doing, as Joe found out in lapse of time. As for him \u2014 apart from business \u2014 he sang a good song, told a smart story, was quick-witted, had a turn for light satire, and in the hey-day of his life was one of the most agreeable fellows I knew, and a jolly companion. In short, he was a general favourite with men and women. I fancy I see him rnow, recounting his latest conquest with C\u00e6sar's triumphant lVeni, vidi, vici ! ' We men set this down as braggadocia, not sharp enough to see that where he did make conquests he made no boast. He had a capital salary for so young a man (he was but twenty five), his employers being no niggards. Then he had an allowance from his father. But, like all universal favourites, Joe spent the small change of time and coin with like lavish hand, the conse quences being late hours and a light purse. Rumour must have blown some of her thistle-down into the Cashes' office, for one day the spirit moved Elkanah to remark quietly, \" Friend Joseph, I fear thy wage scarcely equals thy requirements ?\" Leeming's blue eyes expanded with surprise and pleasure. Something good was surely coming, he was certainly booked for an advance. \" Well, to be frank, sir, it scarcely does. I am always cleaned out before my salary is due. I find it impossible to keep square.\""], [135, "joe's first marriage 123 \" Didst thou ever attempt to square the circle with thy sovereigns, Joseph ?\" put in Silas drily, looking up from the drawing under inspection. \" I do not understand you, sir,\" answered Joe, a little less elate and sanguine. \" Dost thou not ? Then I had better explain. Didst thou ever try to square thy needs with thy coin ? Thou knowest guineas are out of date, but there are uncalculating people who expect to pay for a guinea's worth of goods with the modern sovereign, and they never square the circle of then- coin. Dost comprehend ? \" Joe reddened. He comprehended a little too well. He was in a confounded fix just then, not knowing how to make a sew pounds to do duty for many guineas. \" What should all this preface mean ? \" he wondered. Elkanah returned to the charge. \" Friend Joseph, we understand thou requirest to draw upon thy pay in advance. Thou knowest that it is adverse to our custom, and not seemly for a young man of thy age. Thou hast no aged mother to sustain, like Robert Jenkins ; thou hast not been sick, like Martin Smith ; thou hast not a wife and children to support, like Thomas Barnes, and thy pay exceeds.\" \" I suppose, gentlemen, we are paid in proportion to our ability ; and possibly our expenditure is in equal ratio,\" interrupted Leeming, recovering his audacity with his indignation at being taken to task. \" No, young man, in proportion to thy love of worldly vanities ! Thou art over-fond of adorning thy person with fanciful raiment, and showy colours ; thou wearesttoo much jewellery ; the essence on thy handkerchief scarcely overpowers the stench of stale cigars, and the very fashion of thy garments is that of the worldling.\" \" Thou shouldst cut thy coat more in accordance with thy cloth,\" chimed in Silas. Joe was on his mettle. A spoiled child at home, he resented interference now. He spoke out. \" I am not a tailor or perhaps I might. I have an eye for colour, and if I prefer blue or claret to drab, and require gilt buttons, what should prevent my having them ?\" \" Thy pocket, friend Joseph,\" suggested the former. Joe was not to be put down. \" Pardon me, sirs, if I venture to remark that there is less broadcloth in my modern coat than in Reuben Fry's drab one, and I'll wager a guinea mine cost the least.\""], [136, "124 joe's first marriage. Both brothers looked grave. This time Elkanah was the spokesman. \" Joseph Leeming, thou exceedest thy privilege. We are not wont to be answered with flippancy when we rebuke a young man's folly. And I would remind thee that we friends never wager.\" Joe bit the pencil in his hand. \" Sirs,\" said he, after a momentary pause for reflection, \" do you find that drawing correct ? Does it meet your approbation ? I am engaged here as a mechanical draughtsman ; may I enquire if I give satisfaction as such ? \" \" As such thou dost undoubtedly,\" answered Elkanah with pointed emphasis. \" And as such I am paid my salary.\" \" Yes, Joseph, thou art. Wherefore these interrogations ?\" \" Because, gentlemen, it occurs to me that our relations begin and end with service rendered and salary paid. If I efficiently perform my part of the contract, I do all you should require. My dress concerns myself alone, and (I say it with all respect) for my doings after office hours I am not responsible here.\" Joe Leeming's manner was cooler than it had been ; he evidently knew his men. Other masters might have dismissed him for presumption. Their acute sense of even-handed justice was appealed to, and they owned the force of the argument ; but he had not much reason to rejoice thereat. \" Thou hast spoken justly, according to the ' Mammon of Unrighteousness,' Joseph Leeming. Thou doest and dost well the work for which we employ thee, and as masters we had no right to reprove either thy foppery or thy extravagance. We, however, respect thy relatives, and thought to do thee friendly service, but if thou art so hot-headed and unwise as to reject the open rebuke of a friend, thou must not complain if we are hence forth thy employers only. To keep thee from temptation we will make thee a small gift to meet thy present difficulties, but cannot suffer thee to draw thy salary in advance, now or ever, and shall not repeat our gift. Thou thinkest as I do, Brother Silas, in this matter ?\" Silas assented, and with Joe's acknowledgments the singular colloquy ended. The bank-note Elkanah put into Joe's hand vanished with due \u25a0celerity ; the lecture he had received vanishing almost as rapidly from his mind. His dress and manner were gay as ever, his reputation as a squire of dames undiminished, but at the works it was remarked that he did not occupy his old position in"], [137, "joe's first marriage. 125 the regard of the Brothers. They had become masters and servant only. You must know I had apartments at Sankey's house, where Leeming visited me with the full approbation of paterfamilias, for were there not three unmarried daughters, one a full-blown rose ready to be gathered into the matrimonial nosegay ? and had not the attractive Mr. Leeming a good salary in presenti, and good expectations in futuro ? The girls themselves were not ill-looking, and not ill-provided for. Perhaps Joe knew that, for his visits to Sankey's increased in frequency and length as the months went by ; Eliza, the eldest, making abortive attempts to appear indifferent, and address him as the common friend of the family. There was no disguising the fact that he had a preference. If the sisters strolled in the garden, he was by Eliza's side (I fell to anybody's lot) ; if she played he turned over her music-book ; he joined her in sentimental duets, and sang pathetic solos with very seductive tones and glances. Then, although a somewhat lax religionist, Sunday morning was sure to see him, gallant in bearing and attire, at the foot of the terrible flight of steps to Walsall churchyard, ready to offer his arm to the blushing lady as a support in the ascent. Summer waned, the green leaves, turned to russet and crimson, fell singly, then in showers from the trees, littered the pathway, and huddled in dusty brown heaps under the hedges, and in nooks by pump or gate-post, but Joe Leeming had not yet \" popped the question \" pro forma to Miss Sankey's papa. Yet his attentions to her were as assiduous as ever, and the family, myself included, regarded him in the light of an acknow ledged lover. Eliza herself did not appear to doubt his ultimate intentions, and no one else could be supposed cognisant of their private confidences. Gossips began to speculate on the state of affairs, and the marriage looming in the distance, as gossips iD a country town will, when they were suddenly thrown into commotion by an event which set tea-cups clattering and tongues wagging far beyond the orthodox nine days. There was a house attached to the foundry of the Brothers Cash, presided over by their sister Rebecca, for mutual accommo dation. Both Silas and Elkanah were, however, married, and had separate homes on a larger scale apart from the works. It was a quietly-conducted little establishment, without show or pretence of any kind ; one maid-servant sufficing to keep the whole in"], [138, "126 joe's first marriage. order, with the help of a boy to run errands and do the rough work. A rosy-lipped, rosy-cheeked damsel was Rebecca Cash's maid, with a bright dark eye, much at variance with her demure countenance and sober attire. She was not herself a Quakeress, but long and careful training under the staid Rebecca's guidance had made her not only an efficient domestic, but to all appearance as discreet a member of the community as her spinster mistress. It so happened that the outer door and window of Sarah's kitchen opened into the foundry yard. The draughtsman's office was built out from the main building on a slight elevation, with a door and window at right angles with the kiichen. It was an unfortunate arrangement, but the frailty of flesh and blood had not been taken into consideration in laying down bricks and mortar, at least so Joe said in the after time. It was unfortunate, because Sarah's table was placed close beneath her window, and Joe Leeming sat at a desk under the office window. There was no blind or screen to either, the smoke from the furnaces dimming ordinary daylight, and rendering clear windows indispensable. As a natural consequence, Joe could scarcely lift his head to make a calculation apart from his paper, or stretch out his arm for a ruler, or pen, or compasses without seeing the dapper form of Sarah Hutton busied over some culinary or household occupa tion. On the other hand, Sarah could not set the tea-tray, mould the pastry, sprinkle, fold, or iron the clothes without looking up involuntarily, and looking up involved the meeting of biue eyes and black. In course of time, not a very long time either, the eyes ceased to be unobservant when they met ; they looked at, then for each other, then into, only to discover strange meaning there, and bring blushes to the face of one. Jim, the lad, was a lazy lout, always out of the way when wanted, and Sarah had often to cross the yard in quest of him, or go herself to the pump for water, and to the shed for coal and wood. Business called Joe Leeming across the yard occasionally, and it happened that the two met now and then. Mistress or maid was all as one to Joe ; he was always polite to a petticoat, and there could surely be no harm in the gallantry which spared the damsel's lungs in calling distant \" Jim,\" or her plump round arm the exertion of plying the pump handle ; and surely less in the"], [139, "joe's first marriage. 127 smiling thanks which repaid his services and disclosed such even rows of white teeth. At least Sarah thought no harm, and if Joe meant any, he settled it with his conscience in his own way. Rebecca Cash kept her domestic very secluded. Except to church, to meeting, or to market, she was seldom permitted to leave the premises. Of danger within the precincts the good old lady never dreamed. None of the grimy faces inside the gates would have captivated her, and the clerks she utterly overlooked. The showy person,good looks and insinuating manners of Joe were, however, sore temptations to the unsuspecting handmaiden, and long before she asked herself if she had a heart, poor child, she had given hers away. More than one hard-working mechanic, attracted by her dimples and dapper form, had sought to win her for a wife, and even sought Miss Cash's intervention, but the young ghi's steady refusal, utterly devoid of coquetry, not only dismissed them hope less, but confirmed the spinster's belief that her maid was impregnable. Sarah was not more than sixteen when she first attracted Joe's attention, and a progressive intimacy of more than two years intervened before matters culminated, and she surrendered \u2014 without discretion \u2014 to the allurements of a lover, very warm and very sincere \u2014 for the time being. As no one suspected Joe's courtship of Cash's servant-girl, so no one observed any failure in his devotion to her \u2014 that is, no one but Sarah herself, and she, poor thing, felt more than observed it. She accused him of neglect and inconstancy, then remonstrated and reproached ; and he, from first denying, assumed an air of injured indignation, and went off' in high dudgeon. For some time the good old Quaker lady had remarked Sarah's absence of mind, her omission of such duties as long usage had not made mechanical, and more than once had reproved her in a quiet way. But the girl began to look pale and thin in the face, started when spoken to, and became altogether so strange and ill, that when she gave a month's \" notice \" on the plea of failing health, and a desire to go home to recruit her strength, neither the Brothers Cash nor their sister were surprised. She had, how ever, been with them from her fourteenth year, and they did not wish to part with her. \" Thou hast been a discreet and faithful handmaiden,\" quoth Silas, \" and we are grieved thy health is impaired by the fumes of the foundry. Dost thou not think if thou had a month's"], [140, "joe's first marriage. 128 holiday, thy native air would restore thee, and fit thee to return to thy place ?\" Sarah stammered out something of \" thanks \u2014 couldn't tell \u2014 was very ill \u2014 would be best at home.\" \" We see thou art ill, but we are loth to part with thee, Sarah, and Silas is willing that I should obtain a temporary substitute during thy sojourn with thy kindred, leaving thy situation open for thee,\" said Rebecca kindly, looking up from her knitting. \" Thy travelling expenses shall be paid, and thy wages go on as if thou wert here,\" added the brother. \" What dost thee think ? \" \" I am sure you are very good to me \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 don't know \u2014 what to say \u2014 I don't deserve \" \" There, there, that will do ! Thee hast nothing to cry about. A faithful servant as thou hast been should be well cared for,\" said Silas, soothingly. Rebecca added, \" Thee had better see if Mary Stamford could take thy place for a month or six weeks, or Ruth Hill ; and thee canst give us thy answer in the morning. Thee canst not wish to be a burden on thy people ! \" Sarah's tears broke out afresh, and with a disclaimer of such intention, she retreated from the parlour. That afternoon, whilst in search of a deputy, she heard from more than one veracious gossip that Mr. Leeming, ' ' the wild young chap in Cashs' office, was goin' to wed Eliza Sankey, the architect's daughter ; her wi' the long brown curls. They had been keepin' company like all summer.\" This, then, was the cause of his desertion ! The stricken girl hurried away, accusing herself of folly in thinking so glorious a creature should fall to her share, when ladies like Miss Sankey were to be had for the asking, and out of her very worship and humility came bitter pangs of self-reproach too grievous? to be borne. f J How* she got home and delivered her message she could never tell, nor how she performed the duties of the evening. She had seen Joe at his desk on her return, but he never lifted his head to look at her, and her wretchedness was extreme. When Rebecca Cash left her room the next morning she found breakfast unprepared, and the rooms as they had been left over night. The lad, Jim, had opened the shutters and lit the fires. Sarah had not been seen. The old lady, in some fear lest the ghi's illness had become serious, ascended the stairs to Sarah's sleeping room. Midway on the top flight she paused."], [141, "joe's first marriage. 129 Surely that was the wail of an infant !\" Doubting her own ears she advanced. As she turned the handle of the door the cry was repeated from within the room. The discreet Sarah lay there, pale, half-dead \u2014 the mother of an immature baby-girl ! A waterspout bursting over the works could not have startled Rebecca Cash more thoroughly. With scarce a word or question, she hastened to her brothers. Silas went for a doctor ; Elkanah to the girl's bedside. However gravely he might look upon her sin, he was not the man to be harsh to her in her dire extremity. He saw that shame and self-reproach were already more than she could bear. Reserving reproach for a more fitting season, he simply said : \" Sarah, art thou wedded ?\" She faltered faintly, \" God help me ! no !\" \" Who is the father of thy child ?\" After a long pause \u2014 \" Joseph Leeming.\" Elkanah's open brow clouded. \"Did the abandoned man promise thee wedlock ?\" \" Oh, dear, yes, sir,\" she gasped ; \" I have the ring here.\" She had a wedding-ring suspended round her neck. Half an hour later, Joe was summoned into the private office, and the doors were carefully closed. He saw from that, and the grave looks of his principals, that \" something was up.\" He was then in disgrace with the people at home ; he had been roystering a few nights before, and fancied some of his jolly doings had reached their ears from one source or other. Strange to say, the actual truth never dawned upon him. Elkanah opened fire. \" Joseph Leeming, we have a damsel under our roof, named Sarah Hutton ; dost thee know aught of her ? \" Joseph's ears tinged. \" I see thee dost ; thy conscious blood is more truth-telling than thy tongue. Thee hast made love to her in thy loose manner, hast thee not ?\" \" Well \u2014 a \u2014 she is pretty ; and I may have told her so ; all girls like to be flattered.\" \" Hast thou said no more than that ?\" questioned Silas. No reply from Joe, who began to feel uncomfortable. \" Sarah Hutton affirms that thou hast promised to marry her. Is that so ?\" Joe was in a perplexity. He tried to brave it out. \" I may have said something of the kind, but women are not to believe all that young fellows say to them.\" K"], [142, "130 joe's first marriage. \"So it would seem ! \" responded Silas drily ; then, in an altered tone, \" Young man.this simple girl, to whom thou hast so lightly made a sacred promise, lies in an upper chamber with a babe beside her. She says thou art the father ! Canst thou deny it ?\" Joe's assurance vanished. He felt that he was in for it now, and looked sheepish enough. \" I am afraid, I \u2014 I \u2014 cannot.\" \" I am glad thou hast not added a fresh falsehood to thy other misdeeds,\" struck in Elkanah. \" And now,\" asked Silas, \" art thou willing to marry Sarah, and make her an honest woman ?\" \" Marry a servant girl !\" \" She is the mother of thy girl,\" said Silas, emphatically. \" But her family, her connections ! \" \"Are honest people. What more wouldst thou have? Farmers of unblemished character until thou stained it.\" \" Young man, we are not disposed to trifle,\" interposed Elkanah. \" If thou wilt make an honest woman of the girl thou hast so cruelly wronged, thou canst retain thy situation, and we will advance thy salary. If not, thou canst take a fortnight's notice, and quit our employ. But thou must decide at once. We respect the damsel, though she has fallen a victim to thy wickedness. The sin lies chiefly at thy door. Nor are we blameless for leaving a tender lamb unguarded within reach of so greedy a wolf. She is in our charge, and we are bound to see justice done. We give thee twenty minutes to decide.\" The speaker pointed to the clock. Joe hesitated. He was in a dilemma. As usual, his pockets were empty of all but bills, dunning letters, and a peremptory refusal from his father to \" supply his extravagance any longer.\" There was Eliza Sankey on the one hand ; but he had not asked her to have him, and if he lost his post, and this got wind, ten to one but she would refuse. And a pretty figure he would cut, without a shilling or a situation, and an ill name to boot. Nor was there any going home in face of his father's letter. He should be in gaol before the month was out. On the other hand, Sarah was as pretty a girl as Miss Sankey, and not badly educated for her station, would certainly make a more tractable wife than the other ; he had good proof that she loved him, and he was not quite sure but he liked her almost as well as her more accomplished rival. Then his conscience began to prick him that he had beguiled this simple-minded, trusting creature, and in his reckless selfishness blighted her young life. Uneasily"], [143, "joe's first marriage. 131 he watched the hands of the clock. Wavering, hesitating, inwardly cursing his unlucky stars, longing for a loophole to escape, dreading to face the future, and his own family, still more dreading duns and disgrace. And the time sped. \" Hast thou decided ?\" was the demand of Silas, punctually to the minute. There was no more time for hesitation. \" I have, sirs ; I will do what I can to atone for my folly.\" \" Call things by their right names, Joseph Leeming. Deliberate teickedness thou shouldst say, not folly,\" said Elkanah, sternly. \" However, we are glad thou hast some sense of justice left, and will make an honest woman of the poor heart-broken thing thou hast ruined. And now,\" added he, \" thou hadst better follow me into the house. Thou must see thy infant, and repeat thy promise to Sarah. Thy presence will act as a balsam to facilitate her recovery, which is somewhat doubtful.\" As Joe told me that night in confidence, the sight of the girl's white face aroused his slumbering conscience ; the touch of his child stirred his pulses strangely ; and as he stooped to kiss the mother, he asked her forgiveness more earnestly than he had ever sought her affection. Four weeks later a small quiet wedding party mounted the steps to Walsall church ; very slowly on account of the bride's feebleness. And as if to furnish food for the gossips, not only was a babe carried to the font for baptism at the same time, but Messrs. Cashs' confidential clerk and good Rebecca (breaking through Quaker law) signed their names as witnesses. Whether they suspected the genuineness of Joe's late repent ance, and attended to prevent him playing the girl a slippery trick at the last, or whether to testify the respect they bore the bride, notwithstanding her fall, and to silence scandal, it is hard to say \u2014 but there they were, and all honour to them for it. There was a pretty commotion at the Sankey's, and I, who had introduced Joe Leeming there, came in for my share of the blame. Eliza was congratulated right and left on having \" escaped such a reprobate ; \" and I must say she bore her disappointment bravely, protesting (which was literally true) that \"Mr. Leeming was free to please himself; no engagement existed between them,\" but the effort cost her a long illness, and Joe was not too graceless to regret his double treachery. So that is how Joe Leeming married his first wife. Poor creature, she never got over the disgrace. Neither his friends nor her own had the Christian charity of the old Quakers ; they showed her the cold shoulder, and she drooped under it. Her"], [144, "132 joe's first marriage. eyes lost their brightness, the red roses never bloomed in her cheeks again, and before two years were gone Joe was a widower. \" What became of the child ? \" \"Oh, she is married herself now, with a troop of little ones around her. Rebecca Cash, after whom she was named, took to the forlorn little thing, and dying, left her a legacy.\" Of course you know that Eliza Sankey was Joe's second. Few women would have forgiven him. But I suppose he was \"irresistible \" after all, and when he, taking a leaf out of the Quakers' note book, was disposed to be just, she was disposed to be generous. I should say he gave her good cause to repent her generosity, though she was too proud to show it. But I know a sort of Nemesis hung over Aim, and when he grew morose and irritable in his closing years, he was haunted by remorseful memories of his first marriage and the fan* young life his selfish ness had blighted."], [145, "THE OLD MILL WHEEL. CHAPTER I. THE HUT. \" Not a pleasant night this to go tramping about the country in, even if certain of a warm fire, and a warm welcome at the end of the journey. A man may rough it in the African bush, and put up with the ' wet season ' when it comes as a blessed change after long and trying drought, but when he gets back to a civilised land, he feels desperately inclined to grumble at uncivil weather.\" The grumbler in this case was a rougMy-clad man, in heavy boots, and a shapeless felt hat which seemed to have done long service. His hair and beard had apparently forgotten the barber, and, in consequence, whether he was thirty or forty years of age, was not clear. A bundle, tied in a coloured handkerchief, was slung over his shoulder, dangling from the end of a stick, and he strode on through rain and mist, across a wild-looking common, like one to whom the very whins and bushes were familiar, until an unexpected fence barred his path, and he made a dead stop. \" Surely I can't have lost my way,\" he said, half aloud. \" I thought I knew every rood of land for twenty miles round. No ! There's the brook and the three alders where Faith and I parted. Poor lass ! I fear she will have lost faith in me ! Absence and silence \u2014 and for how long ? But this fence ! \u2014 hang it ! I must have gone astray in this murky November mist. I thought I was not more than a stone's throw of the farmer's gate. Oh ! may be he has borrowed a few acres from the common, and ploughed it up.\" And over the fence went one long leg and then a second ; and after some floundering among what he con ceived to be furrows, he discovered it to be fallow ground, broken up, full of ruts and pitfalls, the outlines of which were dim and indistinct in the mist, and rain, and growing darkness. \" Hang it ! I must have lost my way, or there have been changes here as great as those in South Africa since I went rambling off in a huff \u2014 a huff, forsooth ; because Farmer Morrison said I was too poor to marry his daughter ; and Faith would not marry me against his will ! I wonder what they will say to me now ! \""], [146, "134 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. His indistinct muttering sank into silent reverie as he strode on manfully straight ahead. He had gone on some hundred paces farther when he broke out afresh, \" I ought to have been at the gate by this. What has gone with the place ? Have I lost my way or my senses, or has the farm disappeared ? Hey! what's this ? \" The exclamation broke from him as his foot slipped, and he rolled down a rough bank to the level of moist, not to say muddy, earth below. Picking himself up, with a sharp expletive, and groping for his stick and bundle, his foot struck against something which had the ring of metal ; and then his hand came in contact with a bar of cold wet iron and then another. \" Why, these are rails,\" he cried, \" and here's a pile of sleepers. I'm in a railway cutting, sure as night, and the farm's gone. Well, it won't do to lodge here ; I'd best follow the cutting \u2014 it's sure to lead somewhere, if only to a shanty. There's no prosecut ing a search to-night.\" He was right. In less than five minutes, a glimmer of light showed him the outline of an open doorway ; and as he dragged bis clogged and weary footsteps nearer, he saw in black relief against the dark grey mist a roughly-constructed hut or shed. It was, as he suspected, a navvy's shelter, and he entered without scruple, for it was empty. The glimmer he had seen was from the embers of a turf fire, kept together by three bricks on the bare hearth. The end of a low wooden box by the hearth had been worn smooth in usage for a seat ; and a rude bench on the opposite side had evidently done similar service. Other furniture there was none, if we except the garniture of picks and spades, winches and levers, in all corners. Stay, at the extreme end farthest from the fire and the doorway, an old sack or two had been thrown on a bundle of straw, possibly for a bed in that palace of labour, not luxury. The man \u2014 his name Jocelyn Prior \u2014 took in all this at a glance ; and, dropping down on the bench, weary in body and spirit, sat for a few moments with his hands clasped between his knees, in utter despondence. \" Gone ! a railway line cut clean through Morrison's land. Not a sign of the farm left. And this is all. I find to greet me on my return. Pshaw !\" cried he, rousing himself. \"House and haystacks may have vanished, but men and women don't disappear without trace in these days. Did not Faith tell me I should never lose her unless I lost a higher faith ? And has not that one word ' Faith' in its double signifi- cance been my guiding star, my safeguard in a thousand dangers and temptations ?\""], [147, "135 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. So saying, he took up an hon bar that did duty for a poker, and endeavoured to coax the mouldering turf into a blaze. Then he peered about for fuel of any kind, but, beyond a loose scrap of wood, could find nothing. With these, however, he induced a show of fire, at which he strove to warm himself. He had previously shaken the rain from his hat and rough jacket. Now he took a flask from his pocket, and took a pull at that ; then a pipe and tobacco-pouch. \" A poor substitute for a supper ! \" murmured he, as he began to smoke ; \" but I have seen the time when I'd neither pipe nor flask to fall back upon, nor roof to cover me, so it's best to be thankful. \" The light of the fire scarcely outlived his pipe. He shivered. \" It would be warmer over there,\" he thought. \" I suppose there is no danger of tramps here to-night. Anyhow, I'll risk it,\" and he threw himself down on the sacks and straw, laying his bundle, muddy though it was, under his head for a pillow, and in the shade of a carpenter's bass and a pile of tools. \" A fellow who has slept on the bare ground, with the sky for a coverlet, needn't be over particular,\" he murmured, as he closed his eyes, adding, \" I only wish there was a door in case of thieves ;\" though what he had worth stealing was not apparent. He had slept fully a couple of hours, when voices and feet on the threshold aroused him. The place was in utter darkness \u2014 so dark that the night outside was light in comparison, and the door way became visible with a woman's figure for a moment in the gap. A man must have preceded her, for Jocelyn Prior heard a gruff voice calling, \" Sal, be sharp and strike a light,\" and threaten ing, with a malediction, to strike her if she hadn't a fire alight in a jiffy ; then growling out another curse on someone who ought to have been there, and kept the fire burning. Jocelyn held his breath, and he also held himself on the alert to spring to his feet, if need be. But the woman struck a match, drew a fresh turf from the box on which he had sat, struck three or four matches in the yet warm embers, placed the turf a-top, then fanned with the corner of her woollen shawl until there was a glow ; and her companion seated on the bench, with his body bent, and his hands over the reviving fire, uttered a grunt of satisfaction. Then Sal, urged to \"look alive,\" sat down on the deal box, opened a basket she had carried, produced a large raised pork pie and a bottle ; the former was cut with the man's clasp-knife and they munched away, taking an occasional pull at the bottle, without ever once turning round."], [148, "136 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. But for a word or two the man had let fall in his angry im patience, Jocelyn Prior might have asked to share their supper, but brutal anathemas against a \"pal \" who had \" shirked the night's job \" warned him to keep in the shade if he could. As they sat eating and drinking over the fire, bent forward to catch its heat, its light fell on a face not to be easily forgotten in its repulsiveness. The nose had at soue time been flattened in a fight, the upper lip cut, the dark sinister brows almost met over ferrety eyes, and on the heavy j;iw and chin bristled a week's beard. If he had a forehead, his billycock hat kept its villany in the dark. He wore the common moleskin suit of a navvy off duty, thick boots, and trousers strapped round under neath the knees. As they ate they talked, Dan, as the woman called him, bend ing forward to expatiate on his disappointment, on the probability that the next night might be fine, and less favourable for their scheme ; how he was half inclined to take Sal with him, and do the job himself \u2014 the said job being the plunder of a mill, where the miller was \" fool enough to be his own banker,\" and \" deserved to be robbed for his folly.\" \"But what if the folks wake ?\" questioned Sal. \" Old Upcott's a sturdy chap, and \" Knock him, and the women folk too, on the head if they squeal. Tim proposes to have his cart handy to-morrow night, and to set the mill on fire as soon as we've got our load, and are ready to drive off. But I'm for doing the job to-night. No time like the present, I say \u2014 What's that ? \" An involuntary movement, or a harder breath drawn by Jocelyn in his horror, had caught the ruffian's ear. He paused, looked round, and started to his feet. Jocelyn saw that he was discovered, and that he must make the best of it. He roused himself up, as if from sleep, shook himself, as if with a shiver ; yawned, yet kept a wary look-out as the man darted forward, then stopped short with a sharp, \"Who are you, mate?\" the bundle, the rough muddy garb, and untrimmed beard of the other suggesting a fellow navvy, or a labourer on tramp. \"Who be I, mate ? Why, a chap down on his luck, and on the wrong side on his supper,\" and he cast an eye on the fragments of their repast. \" What brings me here ? Well, a half-drowned dog's glad on any kennel. Thank you, mistress,\" and he seated himself on the box from which the woman had arisen, wilfully misunderstanding the movement. \" A fire's meat an' drink to a hungry man after a long tramp in the wet.\" \" Hungry, be you ? \" said Sal, rummaging in the basket, and bringing out a hunch of bread and a lump of cheese, which she"], [149, "137 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. thrust into his ready hand. All this time Dan had watched him furtively, as if wondering what he had heard, or if he had heard anything. He resumed his seat on the bench and his questions, \" Where do you hail from, mate ?\" \"Down south,\" was the reply, from a mouth full of bread and cheese. \"Out of work, eh?\" A nod. \"Be glad of a job?\" \" Ay, if there's aught to be got by it.\" Dan lit his pipe, reflected, sounded the stranger still further, thought he had a comrade ready made to his hand ; began to unfold his plot for the burglary at Upcott's mill, where the booty was large and the risk small \u2014 Jocelyn nodding at each point, as if in assent, but mentally calculating their relative strength if it came to a tussle, and whether he could best serve good old Jacob Upcott by springing on the murderous plotter, and having it out with him then and there, or, by seeming to bear a hand with Dan to the end, pounce upon him at the mill, and so bring him to justice. Here the odds were against him, for a woman could wield a pick or a crow-bar, if her evil companion was getting the worst of it ; and a man might be murdered, and buried in the broken ground, and none be the wiser. \"How many folk sleep in this mill? an' be it far off?\" he asked, producing his own short pipe \u2014 a short clay, like the navvy's. \" Only the old couple and a slip of a lass,\" said the man, giving the turf a touch with his foot, and lazily stretching out his hand for the primitive poker. At that instant, Jocelyn Prior stooped to light his pipe at the incandescent turf. Dan caught the sparkle, as of a star, on the other's finger ; m another moment a thousand stars seemed to flash in Jocelyn's eyes, as the hon bar was uplifted and came down on his head with a crash, and he fell to the ground \u2014 stunned. A diamond ring had betrayed him. \" Thou's done for him, Dan ! \" he seemed to hear, as in a dream, after a brief oblivion. \" I meant to do for him, the sneak ! \" fell on his ears in the same far-off dreaminess. He was stunned only \u2014 not killed, thanks to his soft felt hat ; though something warm was trickling across his forehead and cheek. He had been roused to partial consciousness by the effort made to draw the ring from his finger, yet he was as helpless as a log. \" Cut it off! \" cried the brute."], [150, "138 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. \" Nay, thou's no gumption. See.\" He felt that his hand was held up to let the blood run down, then that his little finger was between the woman's teeth, and his ring going. What matter, if they would but spare his life ! Spare his life ! What were they about to do ? They were carrying him between them out into the open air, the man at his shoulders grumbling at the weight ; the woman, all in a tremble, held his feet. The fresh air was reviving. They seemed to tramp a distance along the cutting, then to emerge from the hollow ; for the wind swept his brow and went soughing through the trees, whirling loose leaves across his face. He opened his eyes. There was a sound of running water. They stopped \u2014 he knew it was at the river. Were they going to throw him in ? He struggled to speak, to get free ! \" Now, Sal, give him a swing, here goes ! Let>him waken and tell our secrets to the fishes.\" The dumb lips broke into a cry, the water answered with a dash, and closed above him and his inarticulate prayer. CHAPTER n. THE MILL. Upcott's Mill \u2014 it had been Upcott's Mill for two or three generations \u2014 occupied a point of land round which the river swept with a sharp curve, interrupted by the strong weir over which it went chafing and fuming in all but seasons of drought * and the old water wheel was the Upcott boast and pride. It had lasted so long, was so large and so powerful, and had done so much honest work in its time, and so little mischief. A troop of willows and alders, growing down to the water's edge, kept the old mill company right and left ; whilst a group of black poplars in the rear stdl further helped to isolate and screen the house from observation landwards. That is, if there had been any to observe. But there was a private lane between the dark-red-brick mill and the high road, a lane where the tall foxgloves nodded, and nettles were rank in the summer time, and where the hoary fences grew crops of moss and grey and yellow lichens all the year round, so that there could be few observers save the farmers' carters, or others who had business at the mill, the nearest house being a quarter of a mile away. It"], [151, "139 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. was certainly a lonely spot, though picturesque in all its details. Yet the miller sang at his work ; the miller's wife, who had a garden and a poultry-yard to think about, did not find it lonely. She was a thrifty woman, and fat birds that laid eggs and cost nothing to feed were profitable ; but with broods of young duck- lings and chickens on her mind she had no time to feel lonely. What her niece, who had lost both her father and mother by death, and her lover by distance, and who was of a meditative turn, might find it, was another matter. She was, however, of a cheerful disposition, taking all dispensations as from a benignant Father in Heaven, and no one heard her complain that the mill was lonely, whatsoever she might feel. She had been fairly educated ; had books and a piano for her leisure, but she helped her aunt in house, garden, and poultry yard, and had very little of that same leisure. A hand sewing machine had found its way also to the mill, so that even the long winter evenings had work to fill them, and her hands were seldom unemployed. But people who have to rise early goto bed early, especially in isolated country places where there is no gas, and public entertainments are few and far between. So on that wet and gusty November night, when the water went over the weir with a rush that told of a week's rain, and the wind sighed and moaned among the leafless trees, there was no inducement for the Upcotts or their niece, Faith Morrison, to sit up beyond nine o'clock, their customary hour. Yet the miller had been late with his accounts that night, and it was nine o'clock when he opened his book of \" Family Devo tions.\" After prayers, Faith led off, in a clear pure voice, that hymn which has in it at once so much confidence and consolation, \" Abide with Me ; \" and her aunt and uncle joined in it with a readiness and fervour which spoke it a favourite. \" It's a long time since you sang that hymn, lass. What made you think of it to-night ?\" said Jacob Upcott, as he put his book back on the shelf. \" I hardly know, uncle,\" answered Faith, lighting the bedroom candles, \" unless it was the sound of the weir, and the wind, and the rain beating against the casements that made me feel \u2014 well \u2014 as if nothing else would suit me so well to-night. I never sing that hymn but I feel as if the Divine arms were out stretched to enfold and protect me and all dear to me.\" \" Ay, my good lass, I understand. You haven't got used to the roar of the wen and the wind together. Now it sounds to>"], [152, "140 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. me like the music of the great organ at church, and I think I sleep best when the weir and the wind sing their loudest.\" \" It makes me sad,\" said Faith, \" and sets me wondering how many people are wandering here and there without a roof to shelter them ; \" and she shivered with something more than cold. \" That old sweetheart of thine, Jocelyn, for one, I've a notion,\" half questioned the miller. \"Yes, uncle, Jocelyn for one,\" sighed the girl, \" though God only knows whether he be dead or alive.\" \" And I think it's just a night to be snug in bed, and be thankful we've got one, asleep or awake,\" put in the aunt, who, though a kind woman enough, was disposed to be practical ; and taking up her candle she said \" Good-night,\" to Faith, and led the way. The inhabited portion of the building lay in the rear, and, extending beyond the working mill, commanded a view of the river above the weir. In this lay the best parlour, and above that the miller's bedroom. Faith's chamber was a sort of attic above that, which she had chosen in preference to a room on the floor below, because it had two windows, and commanded a more extensive view alike of the winding river and the distant moorland. As she set down her candle on her dimity-covered table, she was struck with the dreamy wistfulness of her image in the looking-glass. \" I wonder what has come over me to-night ! I feel unac countably wretched and restless ; and the roar of that weir does not make me feel more comfortable. I would ask aunt to let me exchange into the back bedroom, but I should not like her to think me nervous. But why should I be nervous ? Why should anyone be nervous whose trust is in God ?\" She had gone to a window to draw down the blind, and stood looking out into the blank gloom. A small American clock on the chimney-piece struck ten weirdly. \" Ten o'clock ! It was ten o'clock, on just such another night, when Jocelyn and I parted at the alders by the brook, in sight of the farm gate five years ago. And now the farm's gone, and father's gone too. Poor Jocelyn ! Father was very hard upon him, for he was steady, and he meant well, and he loved me dearly \u2014 if he was poor. Five years, and never a word or a line ! It is a long time to wait. And sometimes I fear he may be dead or \u2014 No ! not married. He would never marry anyone but me, I am sure of that. God help us both ! I had need to sing ' Abide with Me ' this night ;"], [153, "141 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. for I feel as if he were in mortal peril , and we both needed a sustaining power.\" She had been slowly undressing as these thoughts passed through her brain, and all but bubbled to her lips. She now knelt down by the side of her bed, on which lay a quilt of her own knitting, and prayed \u2014 prayed as one who had a real petition to present to a real Power, and then laid herself down in her white bed, repeating verse by verse the hymn she had sung downstairs. It seemed to haunt her. And the weir seemed to roar more impressively than ever before, and the bare branches of a great willow by the water's edge swung to and fro by the gusty wind, beat against the side of the house like the lashing of a flail, and would not suffer her to sleep. In the room below the miller snored most sonorously \u2014 a proof of the somnolent effect of rushing wind and water upon him. Mrs. Upcott was not so easily lulled to rest that night. The mention of Jocelyn Prior had roused some qualms of conscience. She remembered well the hint she had given her brother, Ned Morrison, to say \" Nay\" to Jocelyn, as one too poor to marry Faith ; and her brother's dying accusation that it was all her fault ; and her reflections were not so pleasant as to induce sleep. She was, however, just dropping off into her first doze when \u2014 was she dreaming or awake ? or was it the moaning wind ? \u2014 she seemed to hear a voice crying for \"Help ! Help !\" and the voice seemed to come from the river. She listened ! surely that was \" Help ! \" and from the very wheel itself ! She shook her husband. He answered with a louder snore. Again she shook him, and roughly. \"Jacob ! there's some one in the wheel !\" Again she shook him. \" Eh, what ? Nonsense, wife ! \" as she repeated her call. \" I tell thee there is, man! Would you let a fellow-creature perish ?\" \" There's naught o' the sort. It's not possible. It's th' wind thou hears\" \" It's not the wind, I tell thee ; it's a man's voice.\" \" Just thee go to sleep. Faith's flayed thee with her notions,\" and the miller composed himself for another snooze. His wife was up, and groping for a match. At that instant there was a knock at the bedroom door. She dropped the match in alarm. \" Aunt ! uncle ! get up. There's a man drowning by the wheel! Get up!\" rang out, in Faith's most affrighted tones."], [154, "142 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. There was no further need to shake Jacob Upcott. He was up and in his clothes before his wife well lit the candle, and, with the keys in his hand, running down the stairs barefooted. He called for a lantern, as he unlocked and unbolted one door after another in the dark, and stood upon the strongly-built platform of the mill, peering over its edge, and calling out \" What's that ?\" before Faith's trembling fingers put the lighted lantern in his hand. Faint, indeed, was the voice that answered him, but sure enough there was a man right within the wheel, clinging to the float boards with the tenacity of despair. \" Oh, uncle ! how could the man get in there ?\" cried Faith, wringing her hands. \" Never mind how he got in, Faith ; how to get him out is the question,\" said the miller. \" Here, take back the lantern, and cast the light down.\" And so saying he laid himself down at full length on the platform, and reached over. His arm was too short ; his fingers only touched a wet tangle of hair. He was afraid to overbalance himself if he stretched too far ; but throwing one arm round a wooden post for a support, he edged himself farther, and made a second attempt, as his wife cried in affright, \"Jacob, you'll be over !\" and Faith, \" There, uncle, you have him ! \" And sure enough he clutched that dark wet tangle with a firm grasp, and strove to draw the man upwards. A deep groan answered the pull. The man himself, whose strength was apparently going, was raised no whit. \" Run for a rope, wife,\" called Jacob. Then, \" I say, my man, can't you put out a hand to save your own life ?\" \" Oh, my poor fellow, do try ; stretch up one hand, and God will help you,\" cried Faith, around whom the light of the lantern shed a sort of halo. Either the rough grasp on his thick locks, or the voice of Faith had roused the man's sinking energies. He did \" try,\" one hand was feebly raised. The burly miller caught it, gave a stout tug, had him by the shoulder, then by both ; Faith lent a hand ; the man was landed, soaking, shivering, limp, on the broad platform. \" Thank God ! \" broke simultaneously from the relieved hearts. The rescued creature uttered not a syllable. \" Quick, wife ! He has fainted.\" Not until the poor fellow began to revive, and Jacob Upcott spoke of trying to \" get him indoors to a sofa,\" did either Faith or her aunt, shivering though they both were, recollect her own impromptu toilette \u2014 a mere shawl thrown over a hastily-donned"], [155, "143 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. petticoat. But now, leaving the lantern behind, Faith took to flight, and Mrs. Upcott followed. What was it set Faith's blood all in a tingle, and kept her nerves in a thrill, as she hurried on her clothes, and hastened to the kitchen, to freshen up the fire, and make herself useful, midnight though it was ? And why was she haunted with memories of Jocelyn Prior ? There was surely nothing about the half-drowned man to remind her of her lost sweetheart ! The light of the lantern had fallen on a broad-shouldered frame, a face pale and smeared with blood, but dark-skinned, and set round with a black bush, on which water-drops glistened. Jocelyn was slim and ruddy ; his hah was brown as a nut, and his chin was clean as her own. \" It is fancy, mere fancy,\" she argued with herself ; \" this is some labourer who has taken too much beer, and fallen into the stream.\" But, as the flickering light of the fresh fire fell on the face and figure of the man, lying in a sort of stupor on the chintz-covered old sofa, to which a trail of wet on the clean stone-floor led her eyes, the fancy seemed to strengthen. She drew nearer. \" The man's badly hurt,\" said her uncle. \" I'm afraid there's been foul play. He's neither boots nor hat, his pockets are turned inside-out, and he's got an ugly cut on the head. Faith, lass, that was never done by our dam, or th' wheel either ! \" As the miller addressed his niece by name, the man's eyelids slowly raised, and his lips faintly murmured, \" Faith !\" She had been nearing him, with her hands tightly clasped together against her bosom, her own eyes straining in curious examination of the man's lineaments. With a suddenness that startled the miller, she flung herself on her knees by the sofa, and laid her head on the wet breast, sobbing, rather than saying, \" Oh, Jocelyn ! Jocelyn ! is it you ? Is it you we have saved ? Thank God ! \" Yes, it was Jocelyn sure enough, and the aunt coming in with scissors, sponge, and plaister, was put in a fresh fluster, for Faith had now fainted in the very clasp of her long-lost lover ; and Mrs. Upcott was almost as much startled as her niece. There would have been little sleep for anyone that night had uot the notable dame insisted that dry clothes were necessary for Jocelyn Prior, and a warm posset and bed for all of them, if they did not want to be laid up with rheumatism or bronchitis, and that it would look better for Faith to bestir herself and be useful than kneel there like a simpleton and hinder her plaistering up Jocelyn' s forehead. An ugly cut indeed was there, when the"], [156, "144 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. damp. clusters of curls were cut away ; what it might have been but for the thick felt hat and abundant hah there is no knowing. Faith shuddered as she saw the long cut exposed and plaistered ; but never in her life had she knelt down by her bedside with more devout thankfulness than when she found herself in her own room, with the knowledge that her lover had been in great peril and restored to her by little less than a miracle. The full extent of that peril she did not know until afterwards. The second supper on which the miller had insisted as necessary after their unwonted exertions, when then* new inmate recovered consciousness, was not in itself sufficient to enable Jocelyn Prior to tell an exciting tale that night. He was too prostrate either to ask or to answer questions. He went to bed with a thankful heart, a mind comparatively at rest. His greatest peril had led to his greatest happiness. Faith was still true to him, her relatives, his deliverers, not unkind. He slept, and slept soundly. The mill had been grinding corn for hours before he awaked, and recalled the strange events of the past nighf . He was stiff and sore enough as he tried to leap out of bed and dress, but he knew the best cure for that was exercise. His clothes, dry and brushed, lay on a chair. He was not long in showing himself downstairs, or in despatching the breakfast, kept waiting for him. Not particularly long in telling Faith how he had fallen among thieves, been robbed, and well-nigh murdered whilst on his way to her ; but the story of his long wanderings, of his fortunes good or ill, he kept fora more convenient season. He had a private revelation to make to the sturdy miller ; and Mrs. Upcott \u2014 who, although devoutly thankful to have lent a hand in saving a human being's life, was not thankful \"to see Faith clinging to a fellow like a navvy, without a shilling to bless himself with, and as like as not to throw herself and her bit of money at his feet \" \u2014 was calling sharply to her niece, \"One pah of hands won't do two folks' work.\" A kiss was taken, and granted. She was off to her household tasks, he in search of the miller. He found the latter examining the wheel with his foreman. He was saying \u2014 \" You see, if it hadn't been an undershot wheel, the chap must have been drowned ; and it was just a mercy it was in the night, and the mill not a-going. And I'm thankful I didn't turn over and go to sleep again, or he would have been drowned as it was.\""], [157, "145 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. \" Mr. Upcott,\" said Jocelyn, \" have your other men been told of last night's adventure ?\" \" No ; why ? \" was the answer. \" Because all our lives may depend on then ignorance and our silence. Can this man be trusted ? \" was the low interrogative. \"What, Dick? ay,\" cried the miller, heartily. \"I would trust Dick to the world's end. But I hate secrets. What is all this mystery about ?\" He was ready to admit the prudence of keeping Jocelyn's presence a secret when he heard how Jocelyn came to be in the river with a wound on his head, with rifled pockets, and without boots ; and further, of the vile plot to rob and fire the mill, if murder made concealment a necessity. \" I knew there d been foul play, lad. I said so last night! Eh ! what a mercy it was I got up, and didn't turn over again to sleep !\" That was undoubted. The point for consideration then was, how to secure the mill and the expected burglars at the same time, and that without exciting alarm or suspicion. Trustworthy Dick proved a good counsellor. \" Yo'd best tell th' missesses. If yo doan't they're sartain to tell th' first woman as comes for eggs or to sell a yard o' tape, of the strange thing that happened in the night ; an' then, whoo ! it's blown about like that,\" and he puffed a cloud of flour from a dusty ledge. It was a wise precaution. Neither Mrs. Upcott nor Faith were nervous, and, sure enough, a woman with a hawker's basket did come to the back door, and whilst selling pins and needles sent her eyes roving from door to door, from bolt to bar ; a woman recognised as \" Sal \" by Jocelyn, from behind the blind of his back bedroom. All went on at the mill as usual. Dick was despatched to the market town with a load of flour, and grumbled audibly at the impossibility of getting back in daylight. Certainly the mill was stopped and the men gone home for the night when the cart drove through the lane to the mill. But lying in the bottom of the cart was a policeman, and Dick, after putting up the horse, entered the house to watch with the rest. Be sure Jocelyn had more than one word to say to Faith, by way of keeping up her courage, before she and her aunt went upstairs, as if to bed, and extinguished their candles as if nothing were on foot. The back door was known to be the point of attack. Midnight had come and gone. There was the sound of light wheels in the lane, of footsteps approaching the house. A skeleton key turned in L"], [158, "146 THE OLD MILL WHEEL. the lock ; bolts were prized back. Two men were in the kitchen, opened the parlour-door, turned their lantern on an old bureau, were about to force it open when they were pounced upon. There was a sharp struggle, in which heavy blows were given and taken. The burglars brought lethal weapons into play. The farmer felt a sharp cut across the arm. A revolver, Jocelyn's own, was aimed at his temple. Faith, candle in hand, stood in the doorway ; the light flashed on Jocelyn's face and Dan's. For an instant the ruffian stood aghast ; in that instant Jocelyn struck the revolver aside, and closed with the man, already stunned with the seeming return of the dead come to life. \" You see I told your secrets to some one besides the fishes, Mr. Dan,\" cried Jocelyn, holding him fast whilst handcuff's were slipped on. \" Ay, worse luck,\" growled the defeated ruffian. In the cart they had brought for their plunder, the burglars were conveyed to prison, and Dan, on whom were found Jocelyn's ring and felt hat, cut through the crown, knew that his would be a fife-sentence. Indeed, both men had gone to the mill armed. Not more grateful was Jocelyn Prior for his rescue from death in the mill-wheel than were the Upcotts for their deliverance from robbery and murder. In their gratitude his poverty was lost sight of. He was not only welcome to Faith, but to a home and a share in the mill. It was not until this was all said and settled that he astonished them all by saying he was \" not a poor man,\" and producing a digger's belt which had escaped the thievish claws of Dan, showed a brilliant store of diamonds. \"Diamonds of my own digging, in South Africa,\" said he. \" I went away, resolved to make no sign until I could come back and buy my darling Faith from Farmer Morrison. Faith's love had been given long before. That, I knew, was not to be bought by anyone.\" There was a merry wedding in a few weeks' time, when all wounds were healed \u2014 the old and the new ; and Jacob Upcott descanted on the merits of his old mill-wheel, with an addenda of grateful thanks that he \"had not turned over and gone to sleep again.\" \" Ay, ay,\" said Jocelyn, who had Faith by his side ; \" your old mill-wheel has been, under Heaven, the means of restoring us to each other ; but, Mrs. Upcott, your readiness to help a fellow creature brought about your own preservation. And had you not listened to the voice of humanity, the voice of gratitude could never have been heard.\""], [159, "LOVE ME, LOYE MY DOG. CHAPTER I. In Farmer Applegarth's lower meadow a bull was being baited ; and from all the moor and fell-side huts and villages around, miners had come trooping in with dogs at their heels, to enjoy the sport. Nay, boys and women were not wanting, for those were rough times, and unless the poor beast had been duly tortured, his flesh would not have been esteemed sufficiently tender for a gentleman's table. Beef was wanting for a banquet at Derwentside Hall, and hence there was a call for the bull-bait. Women then worked in the depths of the coal-pits, not merely on the banks, and were naturally amazons of a coarse and brutalised type, mingling freely with the men in then rough games, just as they shared their labours. . A strong stake being driven securely into the ground, a fine young bull, with sleek brown hide and fiery eyes, was fastened to it, with length of chain just sufficient to leave him free to throw himself about in impotent attempts to break away. Then, one by one, thick-set, black-muzzled, strong-fanged bull-dogs were let loose upon him ; dogs trained to the sport, and expected to grip the bull firmly by the nostril and pin him to the earth. But the proud animal, already chafed by the chain and the vociferous spectators, was not likely to brook this onslaught ; and they who ventured their dogs were prepared to see them caught on the ready horns of the bull, and tossed high in air over his head, gored, maimed, and bleeding, to lie down and die, or return to the charge more furious from defeat, whilst the chained beast champed and bellowed, and bending down its strong and massive head, brought its defensive horns low enough to catch his foes one after another on their formidable points, and fling them to their defeated fellows ; or, wild with pain, strove in vain to shake his tormentors from frothy lip, or bleeding flank and dew-lap till he sank exhausted, the dogs were choked off, and the butcher with his pole-axe put an end to the brutal sport. Common as were stich -scenes, it is not to be supposed tha<t the"], [160, "148 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. whole of the community countenanced or upheld them. They were sanctioned by custom and long usage, but humanity and intelligence shrank from such spectacles, and tender-hearted women shuddered at the very thought. Such, though reared on the moor-side, with none of the educational advantages of the present day, was Hope Wolsingham, dairymaid on the Applegarth farm, which was situated near the confines of the Derwentside woods, sheltered and almost shadowed by the oak-crowned rocks, below which rose and fell with many curves the mile-long byeway to the river and the hall. Between the woods and the farm, round which it swept, ran the broader lane common to the scattered population, and was cut up into deep ruts by the wheels of coal waggons and farmer's carts. Not far away was a side gate into the woods, and anyone crossing thence to the moors must pass the farmyard gate. At this moor-side farm Hope Wolsingham had been placed by her grandmother when she was little over nine years of age. Her father and mother had both been Mlled by choke-damp in the bottom of the coal-pit where they worked together, and Betty Wolsingham \u2014 nurse and doctress to the whole moor-side \u2014 thought she had done well for her orphan grandchild when Gilbert Applegarth and his wife agreed to take the little one, and find her work on the farm. She patted Hope's fair head as she left her standing by the oak settle in the big kitchen, and bade her be a \" gude bairn ; \" but she had no oppressive forebodings of how the little back would ache with stooping to pick stones and weeds all day long, week in and week out ; or how lonely and monotonous it would be to stand in a field all the sunlit hours to frighten birds from the farmer's crops with clapper, voice, and wild gesticulations, till arms and throat alike were weary. Indeed, had any philanthropist, born out of due time, so much as hinted that a growing child's strength should not be overtaxed, Betty, wise in her own generation, would no doubt have asked in indignant response : \" Wey, what div ye think lads and lasses wor myed fur, but te wark ? Wark's gude fur th' bairn, and wark she mun, iv she myens te live.\" And really, judging from appearances, work did not seem to have done the girl much harm. She had had a good and sensible mistress. Dame Applegarth had taken her into favour, not the favour of indulgence, but judicious training for her walk in life ; and at nineteen, Hope had much to thank her work and her mistress for. The fresh breezes of moor and fell had fanned the roses of her cheeks and elbows into perennial bloom. Her foot was firm and free ; she was straight as a willow- wand, and as"], [161, "LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. 149 supple, and balanced the laden milk-pail on her head as easily as a countess might carry her coronet. Be sure, many a shy glance was cast towards Gilbert Apple garth's rosy-cheeked dairymaid at fair or market, or at the parish church on a Sunday ; but Hope seemed provokingly unconscious, and would-be wooers had small encouragement. Perhaps the right one had not glanced her way. Perhaps, Amos Hedley, the new gamekeeper at Derwentside, might have found her less indifferent had he sought her out. But though the buxom maid might be seen in the farmyard at all hours, or on her way to field or byre with stool and pail, or decorating the barkless dairy tree with cans that shone like silver, or, if it were summer time, churning in the open ah, Amos Hedley would cross the road, and stalk past the farm gate with his gun over his shoulder, and two or three dogs at his heels, whistling, in utter disregard of the clear grey eyes that followed his footsteps, until trees or the rocky banks of the descending lane swallowed up dogs, man, and the last glint of his gun-barrel. He was a firmly-built, keen-eyed young fellow, with crisp amber curls and fresh ruddy complexion, and Hope was not the only damsel who had speculated whether the new-comer had left a sweetheart behind him elsewhere. It so happened that Amos had been out on the moors in attendance on his master and a party of sporting friends, and on his way homewards, laden with grouse and moor-fowl, took a short cut through Applegarth's meadow during the progress of the bull-bait. Gipsy, a favourite black-and-tan setter, ran by his side, with eyes that sparkled like black crystals in his graceful head, with every motion of which his pendulous ears flapped and shone like silk ; but the drooping curve of his feathery tail, and the dark, earthy clots on the fringe of his limbs, told of a heavy day's work and a readiness for the kennel. Whether weariness or curiosity, or both combined, prompted Amos to take the field-path rather than the lane, he soon had cause to regret his choice. Your gamekeeper is never a favourite with the dregs of a rural population, more particularly if he be a faithful conserver of his master's interests, and Amos Hedley had not won his way into favour by familiarity. His appearance on the scene was a signal for scowling and whispering. It was observed and hinted that his gun was slung at his back, and that he had only one dog with him. Presently someone \u2014 it was afterwards said Nick Faw, the travelling tinker \u2014 suggested that it would be fine fun to see Gipsy"], [162, "150 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. set a bull ; his cronies, Joey Dobson and Mat Laing, about whom hung a flavour of poaching, catching and communicating the \" gran lairk \" to others. No coal-pit ever fired more rapidly than the refuse of that crowd, already excited to_ explosion. Amos had loitered to look on, Gipsy wagging his tail and putting down his head, dubiously, as cries of \"Naw,.Grip!\" \" Naw, Holdfast ! \" \" Pincher fur iwor ! \" \" Naw Grip's pinned un, by'r lakins ! \" \" Dom ye, Pincher hez him ! \" half drowned the stifled bellowing of the bull. There was a simultaneous movement amongst the crowd, the setter was caught up by experienced hands, and before Amos, who was hustled aside, could interpose, the dog was flung into the open ring right in the face of the maddened beast. Nature and training were against his attacking so formidable a foe, yet Gipsy was too well-bred to turn tail, even had there been time. The bull, with Holdfast on his flank, Grip hanging to his lip, and Pincher on his shoulder, yet made a final spurt to shake them off, and meet the new assailant. Down went the strong sharp horn, and Gipsy flew into the air, and landed far behind with a great gash in his side, and a broken foreleg. \" Who did that? \" cried Amos angrily, as he caught sight of the setter in the ring. \" Gip, Gip ! \" but the good dog was past recall ; and the gamekeeper, descrying a grinning face before him, clutched the owner by the collar, and well shook the grimy fellow, whom he accused of the cruel deed in no measured language. Nick Faw had both hands free, and helpers ready. Tearing himself loose he struck out at Amos, who was cumbered with his load of game. The mischievous conspirators closed round with shouts and yells ; the birds were torn from him, and tossed from hand to hand ; the flagging bull was forgotten now that there was an obnoxious item of humanity to bait ; and though the shrill voices of women and the gruff tones of sturdy men called loudly for fair play, and though Farmer Applegarth hurried up and strove with strength of limb and authority to part the swaying crowd, Amos was battered right and left, his one pair of muscular hands availing little against the shower of kicks and blows which fell upon him and threatened a fatal issue. Already his manful bearing had created a diversion in his favour amongst the miners and other non-plotters. An attempt at his rescue, which might have resulted in a general fight, was being made, when there was a simultaneous cry from the skirts of the noisy crowd, \" Sir William ! \" \" Sir William ! \" and almost"], [163, "151 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. at the same moment was -heard the authoritative demand, \" What is the meaning of this ? \" The unlooked-for appearance of the baronet and his friends cowed the turbulent spirits, that is, as soon as the silence which fell on the fringe of the dispersing crowd communicated its warn ing to the writhing knot of brutes who had Amos Hedley in their midst struggling for his life, now up, now down. Nick Faw slunk away on the first alarm, leaving his two associates, Joey and Mat, to bear the brunt of the baronet's displeasure ; and when Amos rose staggering to his feet a bleeding, bruised, and disordered libel on the fresh -looking young fellow who had come so fearlessly into their midst, hands were not wanting to secure the delinquents, or tongues to tell their demerits. And a demerit not to be overlooked by the men who had pitted their bull-dogs against the bull, by this time despatched, was the outrageous unfairness of flinging a setter in the ring at a bull bait ; the onslaught on the keeper was as nothing in comparison. Nor was Sir William likely to overlook either the loss of his four-footed favourite, which had unaccountably disappeared, or the maltreatment of his servant. Cursing Nick Faw with every step of the long road, Joey Dobson and Mat Laing were hauled off with scant ceremony to the justice-room of the hall, and thence transition to the local house of correction was swifter than pleasant. It was no use for notorious poachers to plead that they were mere tools of Nick Faw, the tinker. They had been instrumental in the destruction or injury of a valuable dog, highly prized by Sir William, and had likewise brutally ill-used his servant. CHAPTERrTI. Although Amos Hedley had struggled to his feet on the opportune arrival of his good master, he staggered like a drunken man, and was only kept from falling by the help of others. Being a single man, he was quartered at the hall with one of the grooms ; but he had bled profusely, and was in no condition to walk thither, and no conveyance was at hand. But Gilbert Applegarth was, and though he did not throw his doors open to every fellow who got bruised in a common brawl, he was ready enough to proffer hospitable welcome and attention to any decent body in distress."], [164, "152 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. He was especially attentive to the wounded Amos, who cut a sorry figure in his torn garments, with his cut lip, swollen nose, and eyes half-closed with pulpy cushions of indescribable hue. In his bluff good-nature he felt as if the onslaught on the gamekeeper in some sort reflected on himself, seeing that it occurred on his own land, and that he could not do too much to wipe out the stain. He assured Sir William that his servant should have every attention at the farm, that his presence there would be \"no inconvenience whatever ; \" and at the young man's earnest request, caused diligent search to be made for the missing setter, which, not being found, dead or alive, was conjectured to have been carried off by the uncanny tinker. When Amos, supported by the farmer and his son, stumbled into the great kitchen \u2014 where a bright fire was blazing on the hearth, gleaming and glimmering again in polished oak, glowing in burnished brass and pewter \u2014 and was helped to a cushioned rocking-chair by the ingle-nook, a stooping female figure rose with a sudden exclamation, to make way for them, almost upsetting a large bowl of water as she did so. It was Hope Wolsingham, whose eyes were red with weeping, and whose clothing bore as many sanguine stains as that of Amos, who was almost too blind, dazed, and exhausted to take note of her or her occupation. A low whine of recognition, a dog's nose against the hand which hung listlessly down, aroused him to the consciousness that Gipsy was safe, and next, that the young woman before him had been compassionately washing the wounds of the poor creature and binding them up as carefully as though it had been human. He could not see how she had wept over the dog, when by some instinct it had crept to her feet at the house-door, or how pitifully she had brought water for its thirst as well as its injuries, or the mental process by which the dog had been associated with its keeper. But for what he did see, his heart thanked her better than his lips. Aye, and thanked her more than when, in conjunction with busy Dame Applegarth, her attention was transferred to himself, and he felt the fingers tremble as they bathed his poor disfigured face, or fed him with healing possets, or shook up the soft feather pillows to ease his aching head and shoulders. Sir William came to see his gamekeeper, and then my lady, whose curiosity had been aroused by her husband's praises of the kind-hearted dairymaid, who had so deftly bound up Gipsy's"], [165, "153 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. gaping side and broken limb, and was taking as much care of the setter as of the young man. Hope curtsied and blushed, and rolled her apron over her hands abstractedly as her ladyship, with condescending affability, commended the maid's humanity and skill ; but she jerked her hands behind her when the lady drew a long crimson silk purse from her handsome reticule to proffer a golden gift, and retreated as if the coin were a very witch's lure. \" Hout, maw leddy ! \" she protested. \" Aw cuddn't, aw cuddn't tak' it ! The puir dumb doggie's welcome twice ower. Awd be a brute mysel' te tak' pay fur th' bit of tendin' aw gied either th' puir doggie or th' canny young chep yander, as they brutes nigh clooted te death ! \" The money went back into the purse of the visitor, who returned to the hall undecided whether to admire or resent the singular young woman's refusal of a reward. Amos Hedley knew, though his eyes were half-shut ; and the \" puir doggie \" might have known, he wagged his tail so unhesita- tingly at her approach, or followed her movements with his bright black eyes before he began to limp after her on his three sound legs. She put aside the faint thanks of Amos, much as she had rejected payment for an act of natural kindness, but she gave the dumb animal many a caress, which the \" canny young chep \" envied ; having no intuitive perception that the tender-hearted maiden was caressing himself by proxy. He had spent a day in bed, with steaks from the brown bull upon his disfigured face, and had quite a week in the farmer's easy-chair, before the taxed-cart wa's sent for him from the hall; and though the farmer and his dame did their hospitable utmost towards his comfort and recovery, he was keenly sensible of the difference of touch and tone when their dairymaid applied a poultice, or administered herbal decoctions prepared from her grandmother's recipes. And though his eyes were black and swollen, he had yet sight enough to discern the fair proportions of Hope's lissom form, the tenderness of her smiling countenance, until, as the outer wounds healed, a new and inner one opened. Hope offered her shoulder for him to lean on as he walked to the cart, and he was not too proud to accept her aid, although he knew well he could have done without it. She ran to the barn for straw to put under his feet, and to make a bed for Gipsy. She stroked and patted the dog, which returned her farewell in demonstrative dog-fashion. She shook iands with Amos heartily, bidding him come and show himself"], [166, "154 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. when he was quite well, and to keep out of the ill-disposed tinker's way. And when the cart had driven off, and Gilbert Applegarth and his wife had gone back into the house, she still lingered at the gate to watch the conveyance as it turned the corner of a moss-grown grey rock, and waved her last good-bye to the young man, who chanced to look back at that moment. Barely had Amos Hedley time to discover that he was in love with pretty, rosy-cheeked Hope Wolsingham, and to torment himself lest his disfigured face should have set her against him, or to resolve that he would not set foot again on Applegarth's .floor until his lip was completely healed, and he could walk erect as of old, self-conscious of strength and comeliness ; barely, I say, had he time to arrive at this stage of feeling and resolve, when news reached the hall that his two poaching assailants had escaped. There had been iron bars to the windows of their prison, and the building was of solid stone, but the rogues and vagabonds were lodged in one common room, and it had a window easily accessible from without. Two of the three iron stanchions, which had seen years of service, had been filed away, evidently by a practised hand. The lead- setting of the diamond-panes had been cut clean through, and the entire window with not a pane broken left outside, along with a rope which dangled from the remaining bar. It was very plain that Nick Faw had come to the rescue of his comrades, and had satisfied them that there was honour among thieves. Sir William and his fellow justices were naturally incensed, threatened the warder with dismissal, and had descriptions of Joey Dobson and Matthew Laing inserted in the Hue-and-Cry, but they might have spared their pains ; the men were not forth coming. A pedlar brought the news with his pack to the servants' hall at Derwentside, and what more natural than for Amos Hedley to hasten with the intelligence to his kind friends at the farm, forgetful of his seamed lips and yet perceptible limp ? Bearing a hare over his shoulder as a present from Sir William to the farmer, a pair of bright shoe-buckles and a gay cap-ribbon from the pedlar's pack for the mistress and her maid, he crossed the park in an unwonted tremor, and had nearly stepped upon a steel man-trap of his own setting, in his incautious hurry through the woods. As he emerged from the shadow of the trees at the copse-gate, he saw that the pedlar must have loitered by the way and left"], [167, "155 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. his news behind him, for all down the village street knots of women with their bare arms crossed, and smutty fellows with short pipes between their teeth, were grouped together, or dispersing to gossip elsewhere. The farm gate stood open ; burly Gilbert Applegarth. with both hands thrust into his breeches' pocket, leaned against the gate-post, demonstrating to an eager audience that none other than Nick Faw the tinker had helped the culprits out of gaol. Wasn't he and them thick as thieves ? And wasn't there a token of his handiwork about it ? Applegarth's tall son George, with a flail over his shoulder, stood close by his father's side, nodding his head in assent, and Amos caught a glimpse of a dark blue printed short gown, or jacket, and a smiling face under a white linen cap between the father and son ; but as he neared the group, he saw a dark petticoat disappear round the corner of the house, and his heart sank with a great fall. He was too busy asking himself the question why Hope ran away, to pay much attention to the queries of others concerning the prison-breakers, and the farmer spoke to him twice before he received an assent to his theory of Nick Faw's tools having done the business. Disheartened by Hope's apparent avoidance, he would have contented himself with handing the hare to the farmer with Sir William's compliments, and leaving the buckles for Dame Applegarth with his own \"respectful service,\" but Gipsy did not answer to his call, his lip was yet too sore for whistling, and Gilbert's hospitality was not to be gainsaid ; so, partly to oblige the farmer, and partly to look after the stray setter, he followed the former into the big kitchen, where Mrs. Applegarth was drawing a smoking hot loaf from the oven. And then the gossips must have dispersed, for Geordie Applegarth's flail was heard at work in the barn. The eyes of Amos were again disappointed. A sun-burned hat on a peg, and a pair of pattens by the door, were all the visible signs of Hope. The dame could not leave her baking, and the farmer wanted cheese and ale. He strode to the door and called \" Hope, hinny ! \" in a voice like a trumpet. At the call Hope came in from the dairy with Gipsy in her wake, licking from his black muzzle the traces of fresh curds. The roses on Hope's cheeks were in their fullest bloom, but her eyes avoided Amos, and after a salutation, too brief and common place to satisfy his new craving, she coolly lifted a brown stone ware jug from a hook, and descended into the cellar for the ale."], [168, "156 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. Then she placed the cheese-biggin, containing nearly half a cheese, beside the ale, and a fresh brown loaf by the side of that, with no more apparent concern than a daily duty called for. Amos felt himself rebuffed. He had not the perception to realise that Gipsy stood proxy for himself when Hope stooped to pat him, or stroke his silken ears, as she went to and fro ; or that she had disappeared on his approach, lest her pleasure should be too self-evident. She had had time, since she saw him cross the lane, to decide that he was well enough to have put in an appearance earlier if he were as grateful as he had professed, and to collect her womanly resolution not to make herself too cheap. So Gipsy came in for the favours self-consciousness withheld from his master. She was sufficiently well -pleased, when Amos, with more parade than was at all necessary, produced the shining shoe-buckles, and begged Mrs. Applegarth to accept them ; and she was ready with her admiration ; but something she would have scorned to call a pain smote her when he rose to depart without offering her \" so mickle as a brass thimmle,\" as she said to herself. Had she followed Amos to the gate, no doubt the bright-hued ribbon would have been forthcoming, but she gave him her hand to shake as he lingered by the door, and said \" gude-bye \" with much less heartiness than did her tall thin mistress, going back to her butter-making before his foot was well off the threshold. I've a notion that had he looked into the dairy and seen her wipe her arm roughly across her eyes, as if half-ashamed that the process was necessary, he would not only have left the ribbon, but something else besides for a remembrance. Gipsy seemed to have an inkling that all was not right, and came rubbing his head against her woollen petticoat, but a sharp call, repeated still more sharply, drew the dog after his discon certed and discontented master, as fast as his three legs would carry him ; and soon the russet woods swallowed up both, and it was no use straining wet eyes at the dairy lattice. CHAPTER III. The misunderstandings of unavowed lovers are, of all others, most persistent, least comprehensible, and least open to happy solution. Amos Hedley and Hope Wolsingham saw just so much of"], [169, "157 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. each other as served to widen the gap between them, and not enough to bridge it over ; yet, with the perverse inconsistency of human nature, the attachment of each became stronger as there seemed less likelihood of a mutual understanding. Servants both, with set duties and hard work before them from one week's end to another, they had no leisure to ruminate with folded hands, and grow morbidly sentimental, but the heart ache was not the less real and deep. The few days' intercourse at the farm, when the man was helpless and the woman tenderly helpful, Lad raised hopes which only lacked confirmation. Alas, for hope ! Their first meeting set doubt in its place, and doubt is an enemy not easily dislodged. The brown and crimson leaves of October had grown dingy under the chilly breath of young November, and lay in sodden heaps under the dripping trees, when the light frost gave way before mist and rain. Amos, in attendance on Sir William, came and went from the park to the moors, the nearest way to which rounded the corner of the farmyard, and crossed the Applegarth meadows, and had frequent opportunities to say a word in passing to whomsoever chanced to be about ; and as they mostly passed at milking-time, whether morning or evening, and the dogs gave notice of their approach, it needed little contrivance to bring Hope within speaking distance on these occasions. But as milking-time came close upon feeding and foddering-time, big Geordie Applegarth was generally there also with his pitchfork, or pails of swill for the porkers, and being fond of a gossip, effectually prevented any private tete-a-tete. Geordie was sublimely unconscious of intrusion, but Amos read in his constant presence an intentional intervention and supervision of Hope only compatible with ulterior designs of his own, and resented it accordingly. He had carried the bright ribbons in his pocket, hoping to find a favourable moment for their presentation ; but, uncertain how his offering might be received, he could not risk it with that raw-boned fellow at her elbow. So the silken love-gift came and went away with him, until, in high displeasure at George Applegarth's association with Hope, he began to pass without glancing towards the farm-gate, even when alone. Nay, if Gipsy were with him, and evinced a desire to run beneath the bars and have a little quiet frolic with Hope, whose plump hand was always ready to stroke his head, a shrill and prolonged whistle summoned the grateful animal away before he could lick her hand in return."], [170, "158 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. Under this fresh slight Hope decided that Amos was ungrate ful, that he was not worth thinking about, and that she would not waste another thought upon him. But she thought of little else. True, she kept out of sight when he was near, but she watched for his coming from behind the dairy lattice, and sighed when he was gone. Hers was not a fading colour, but its brightness paled ; she lost her spirits and her appetite, and then Dame Applegarth took notice of the change. Hope insisted it was only due to the weather, but the good dame thought otherwise, and decided that her maid should have a holiday for the purpose of consulting her grandmother, the doctress, and bringing back such herbs and simples as their own garden might not afford. Betty Wolsingham, when at home, which was but seldom, occupied a small cottage in a sort of rift, high on the side of Black Fell. Other cottages, chiefly inhabited by pitmen and their families, were scattered here and there, singly or in groups. Hers stood alone and aloof, under the shelter of a grey rock, and was distinguished by a small patch of garden-ground, in which Betty reared a few vegetables and such medicinal herbs as would flourish with little cultivation. A clear spring of pure water trickled from the rock behind, and ran away in a thin rillet down the hillside, leaping in spray here and there until it lost itself in a wider bum, inky as the coal deposits whence it flowed. Burnhead was little more than three miles from Derwent side, but three miles of rugged, pathless road over moor and fell, intersected with yawning caverns in the shape of old and abandoned coal-pits, with gorse and whin to impede progress if the \" blind path \" were deserted ; three miles, I say, of such road might well count as six. So Dame Applegarth must have felt when she filled with fresh butter, new-laid eggs, a piece of bacon, and a pie, a basket for Hope to carry to her grandmother, and hurried the girl off early on the Saturday afternoon, with strict injunctions not to return until the next day, when she was to start early from Burnhead, lest the mists of evening should overtake her before she got home. Hope took the basket and trudged off, hardly feeling its weight ; perhaps her heart was the heavier of the two, for as she left the house-door she saw Amos Hedley at the copse-gate, and though his foot advanced as if to meet her, he stepped back, and the sudden smile died out from his face. She had not seen Gilbert Applegarth and Geordie together"], [171, "159 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. watching her from the farmyard, or heard, as Amos had, the farmer's words to his son as he slapped him on the back encouragingly with one hand, and pointed at the same time to the figure going towards the village with the other. \" Theer's a canny lass fur thee, Gwordie, nivvor her marrow in all Durwham.\" A canny lass, indeed, under the grey duffel cloak, with the gipsy hat tied down so closely and modestly under her chin, so as to cover her ears, and shadow her face from either glaring sun or staring eyes. There was little sun to stare at her that November afternoon, and the few pitmen she met, with their picks over their shoul ders, and their empty bait-pokes slung behind, merely said, \" Gude-den, hinny,\" and passed on. Never had the road to her grandmother's seemed so long and wearisome. Either she was really ill, or had been disheartened at the first start, for before she had gone half the distance she sat down to rest on a boulder grey and yellow with lichen, and put her basket beside her, glad to be relieved of the weight. As she sat there pondering what Amos Hedley really thought about her, and whether it was true he was courting the laundry maid at the hall, and whether it would be wise to mention him at all to her old grandmother, ruminating in a desultory sort of way, looking absently before her across the fell the while, she saw a figure approaching in the distance, and suddenly recognised the disreputable tinker, Nick Faw. She snatched up her basket in the instant and hastened along, with steps no longer retarded by love-dreams, but quickened by apprehension. Apparently he was not journeying her way, for, on looking back after awhile, distance, or the inequalities of the road, hid him from view. Greatly to Hope's disappointment, Betty Wolsingham's cottage was closed. Its owner was evidently abroad smoothing someone's way either into the world or out of it, for the door was locked, which was never the case during temporary absence. What should she do now ? Go back she must, and that without delay; but she was already tired, and had no mind to carry a heavy load back with her. There was a small stone bench outside the cottage, and here she seated herself to consider \u2014 not the expanded prospect before her, but her own. The walk had given her an appetite. Congratulating herself on the pork-pie in her basket, she broke down its wall of paste without ceremony, and finding a tin dipper at the back of the cottage helped herself to a draught of water from the spring."], [172, "160 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. She then tried both casements, but they had been carefully secured, so there was no chance of emptying her basket on the window seat within. Her only plan was to leave the things and a message with Betty's nearest neighbour \u2014 a collier's wife, who lived some four hundred yards away down the burn-side. This would take her out of her way, but it would be better than going back so laden. So resolving, she again lifted her basket, this time with a little sigh of weariness ; but the afternoon was advancing, and, though she knew every foot of the road, the knowledge came with the consciousness that it was safest trodden before the shadows closed in. From the collier's wife she ascertained that her grandmother had only left home the previous day, and had fastened up her cottage because there were some \" uncanny chaps hingin' an' keekin' aboot.\" Hope's heart gave a leap as she thought of Nick Faw, and she was half inclined to accept the woman's hospitable invitation to remain there until morning. She had, however, too clear a perception of the already overcrowded state of the pitman's hut to add to its inconvenience. Contenting herself with leaving the comestibles behind for the woman's own use, reserving only the bacon for her grandmother, with many profuse apologies for rejecting the hospitality pressed upon her, she turned her face homeward, not without calculating how far she should be able to travel before darkness came to obscure her path. A stout heart had Hope. Setting fatigue aside, she stepped forward resolutely, with the grey hood of her cloak draw*n over her hat, and the empty basket swinging in her hand to the motion of her feet. It was anything but a straight or a defined path ; here and there she followed the downward course of the burn once or twice she crossed the running water with a bound, now she traversed a precipitous ledge of rock, anon a cleft in which the day was quenched, and from which she only emerged to find the twilight deepening, and a thick mist blotting the outlines of the landscape. She was glad when she reached the open moor- land, and knew that more than half the distance was traversed. For the first time she stopped to rest, leaning against a low grey ridge of stone whilst she shook the chafing sand and pebbles out of her shoes. As if the very stoppage had conjured up a \" bogle,\" she heard a loud halloo, which was answered by a rough voice, apparently on the other side the ridge, and within two yards of the spot where she stood."], [173, "LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. 161 Neither the call nor the answer were in choice language ; but -what made her heart sink was that the man hailed had answered to the name of \" Nick,\" and that she could not pursue her road without being seen as soon as she reached the dip of the slatev screen of stone. Hope's breath came and went. The spot was lonely. The man had an evil name, and his friends were tarred with the same brush. She was equally at a loss whether to advance or retreat, and indeed was half afraid to stir lest the crunch of loose stone beneath her tread might tell of her presence. And now she felt that even the gathering fog was a friend to her ; she might be able to pass the end of the ridge under its veil. There was no danger on the moors she dreaded in com parison with those men, of whom she had had a shuddering horror since the day she saw young Amos Hedley so bruised and battered by their brutality. As she paused in fear and uncertainty she heard Nick Faw abuse the others for keeping him waiting so long in the cold. Then there was a gurgling sound as of liquor passing from a bottle-neck down someone's throat, and then \u2014 well might she hold her breath and listen with mouth agape \u2014 all the details were discussed of a well-laid plan to break into Derwentside Hall on the Monday night, and carry off whatever plate and valuables they could Jay their hands on, any opposition on the part of tho inmates to be silenced by the knife. Hope's ears and nerves were strained to the uttermost, her dread of discovery increased by the weight of the secret now in her keeping, and she longed to hear the men depart and leave the path open to her. Presently there was a move, a move that appalled her. Nick Faw announced his intention to return to Black Fell. If he did, he must turn the corner of the ridge, and not even the fog would hide if he brushed against her. Resolution came quick as thought. Gathering herself together she darted off like an arrow from the string, passed the dip of the rock unseen, if not unheard, in the fog, and barely caught the startled \"What be yan ? \" or the jeering reply, \" A hare, mon ! Div ye think it be auld Clootie ? \" as away she scudded with all the celerity of fear and its reckless lack of perception. In the one dread of pursuit she kept her course, though she could scarcely see a yard before her, and landmarks had disap peared. Soon she had a dim consciousness that she had lost her way, and moved forward with more caution. Now she began to wish 31"], [174, "162 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. she had accepted the horn-lantern offered by the pitman's wife, that she might scan the path before her feet, and distinguish bushes from boulders. She was worn out with fatigue, terror, and anxiety, and what wonder if she also wished for the arm of Amos to sustain her, as she stumbled at every step ? All at once her spirits rose ; she fancied she discerned a well-known clump of bushes through which ran a narrow footpath leading direct to the village, and Hope congratulated herself on being so near home. Yes ; there was the gap between the gorse. She put her foot confidently forward \u2014 a shriek pierced the fog ! She was going dizzily down, down into depths of unutterable darkness ! CHAPTER IV. A quick shock, a sense of rapid descent, a feeling of stifling suffocation, of a head swollen to bursting, dizziness, appalling terror, a retrospective vision of life, a horror of death, a plunge into cold water, a return to consciousness ! Hope was struggling instinctively in the treacherous element which had saved her life by breaking her tremendous fall, and now threatened to engulph her. Had she known that she was thirty fathoms below the surface of the moor, she would have given up hope, and been lost ; but though the water rushed into her mouth and drowned her cries for help, and though her woollen cloak was heavy and clung to her, she struggled to keep her head free, and, in struggling, her open hand struck the rugged side of the pit and grasped it tenaciously. Slight as was the hold, it supported her to strike her feet downward and find solid ground beneath them, and now the water came only to her armpits \u2014 she could breathe again. Half afraid to move a step in the pitchy darkness, she raised her voice again, only to hear her call reverberate as it rose, and to feel how hopeless was her situation. Yet she groped with one hand along the wall, and strove to find a higher level for her foot. At length her hand struck against a projection just above her head. It was a piece of timber, a Mnd of beam, doubtless one of the supports of the shaft when that had first been sunk for coal. At the full stretch of her arm she contrived to grip it firmly ; and so, holding fast by the left hand, with the other she loosened the fastening of her saturated cloak and let it go. Re lieved of its dragging weight, she threw up her right hand also to"], [175, "LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. 163 the beam, and clinging firmly with the strength born of despair, planted her feet against the rough wall of the shaft, and foot by foot \u2014 the water buoying her up \u2014 raised herself higher and higher, until, with a supreme effort, she swung herself across the beam. The position was painful and critical. She had no light to guide her. In gaining the beam she had lost her foothold of the wall, and so great was the pressure on her waist, she felt assured she must drop unless she could scramble into a sitting posture. After one or two narrow mischances, which sent her heart leaping into her throat, she attained her object, and thanked God for comparative safety. Yet was her situation little less perilous. The beam had not more than the circumference of a man's hat-crown, and her sole support being the side of the shaft, her seat was necessarily very insecure, added to which her feet were yet in the cramping water, her strength was well-nigh gone, and with the temporaiy rest a sense of drowsiness stole over her. Fortunately, hunger came to keep her awake, and with it longings for the half-eaten pie left at the collier's cottage. So far, struggles for immediate safety had overpowered every other thought and feeling ; but now the desolation and hopelessness of her position smote Hope. Of time she could take no note. It was the 27th of November, and its fog was thick enough to blot out moon and stars, had either hung above that old pit-mouth. Not until day had fully chased the mists and shadows did a glimmering patch of light high up above her tell her that only one night had gone. To her it seemed as if the darkness was perpetual, and she had been there treble the time. During the night she had contrived to raise her feet out of the icy water, and extend them before her on the beam ; but they were almost numb, and she shivered in her wet clothes. With her hungry longings had come thoughts of all the good things at the farm to tantalise her ; and then the knowledge that she would not be missed until the Sunday night set in ; and she began to question her own powers of endurance, and to wonder if she could hold out until they began to search for her. She wondered, too, how long it would be before Amos Hedley heard that she was missing, and if he would join in the search. And then, as if conjured up by the thought of Amos, came in a flash over her mind the dreadful plot she had overheard, and the danger which threatened his master's household, and perchance himself. In the consciousness that she held a secret on which both life and property might hang, her hunger was for the time"], [176, "164 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. forgotten, and feverish longing to escape and warn Sir William overpowered all else. She screamed until she was hoarse, but only : her own voice came back to her ; and as the hours went slowly by, and her clothes dried upon her, she grew parched and doubly feverish. To quench her intolerable thirst, she drew gently up the tail of her linen gown, which hung below drabbling in the water, and sucked the moisture out ; but it had to be done with caution, lest she should overbalance. And ever and anon she shrieked for \" help \" and \" Amos,\" but neither came ; though another night wore out, and another day passed its meridian. She grew clamorous for food, fever was gaining upon her, and after lapses into despairing silence, her cries grew sharp and shrill. Not until the day began to wane, and the gathering shadows sent home the farmer and his son to their Sunday evening meal, did Dame Applegarth evince any surprise at her maid's long absence. Then she began to remark that Hope was late, that it was not safe for a girl to wander on the fells after dark, and threatened to rebuke her when she did get home. But when night began to show a black face at the diamond casement, and the flames of the blazing fire leapt up to light the kitchen with reflections in polished oak and pewter, she looked uneasily out, and bade \" Gwordietak alanthern, and leet th' canny bairn through the mirk.\" Geordie seemed somewhat loth to stir himself, but he never dreamed of disputing his mother's behests ; so he reached a horn lantern from a hook behind the door, carefully lit and adjusted the bit of home-made candle within, closed the lantern deliberately, and, with a stick in one hand, set off on his errand, nothing doubting he should meet her before his long legs had carried him the length of the village. Before he had gone far he met various parties of young fellows returning from the fell, some with game-cocks under their arms, others with bandy-sticks, or trigs ; cock-fighting, bandy, trippet and-coit, and other gambling games, making the fell side like a fair on Sunday afternoons. Several of these he questioned, but no one had seen or overtaken Hope, and when he had gone little more than a mile he turned back, satisfied in his own mind that she had stayed with her old grandmother. He was not gallant, and he wanted his supper. He was, however, away quite long enough to add to his mother's uneasiness, without allaying it. She had never known Hope so far behind time in all the years of her long service ; the"], [177, "165 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. lass had been like a daughter to her ; and unpunctuality in her mind portended evil. As Geordie came back down the village street, the light of the lantern gleamed on the white mutch, or long-eared linen cap, of his mother, as her head was stretched over the gate and her anxious \" Wheer's Hope ? \" greeted him. The question, and the short \" Aw dinnet ken,\" with the longer assurance which followed that she must be \" steyin' wiv auld Betty, for sarten ! \" being asked and answered from a dis tance, reached the ears of another watcher across the road. From the copse-gate, which he had already unfastened, came Amos Hedley, equipped for night-duty, with his gun over his shoulder. From the tenour of his questions it would seem he was no better satisfied with Geordie's excuse than was Dame Applegarth, or the farmer, who joined them at the gate ; and, but that the gamekeeper's duty tied him to his master's woods all night, he would himself have set off to put anxiety to rest, although the farmer assured him it \" wad be kittle wark for a stranger te gan ower th' fell after neetfa' ; an' th' wench meet be syef enoof ester a'.\" In that \" might be \" the good dame and Amos were compelled to look for hope, for Geordie showed no disposition for another march in search of his mother's dairymaid. But Amos watched that night with an impatience for the dawn he had rarely known before. Instead of retiring to rest when the hour came to report himself to the head keeper, he swallowed in haste a glass of ale, thrust a hunch of bread and cheese in his coat-pocket, and was off on his self-appointed errand to Burnhead. Geordie's nonchalance had allayed his jealousy, but not his fears or his love, and the restlessness which had gathered force during the night gave speed to his flying feet, and made his possible reception a matter of small moment. Disappointment awaited him at Betty's cottage, as it had awaited Hope. A pair of robins were breakfasting on the crumbs left from Hope's repast, but doors and windows were alike secured, and no hospitable smoke curled from the low chimney-top. He stood hesitating ; the crumbs were an assurance that someone had been there but recently. Possibly Hope and her grandmother had together quitted the cottage that very morning, and gone to make a neighbourly call before the former returned to the farm. He cast Ms eyes around and singled out a cottage for inquiry,"], [178, "166 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. overleaping rock and burn in his impatient descent. It chanced to be the one Hope had gone out of her way to visit. \" Aye, Hope had ben theer, suir enoof, but nowt wad gar her stop ; \" then observant of the ghastly change in her questioner's face, the woman added the kindly consolation that she might have stopped somewhere else farther down the fell when she found the fog coming on, and would most likely have reached home before then. Alternately hoping and fearing, he hurried back after thanking his informant, turning aside from the trodden path, with tireless foot and expectant voice, towards every shepherd's hut or pitman's cottage within range, wherever it seemed feasible the girl he now loved so dearly might have sought a night's shelter and hospitality in emergency. But, oh ! how haggard was the face Amos presented when he burst into Farmer Applegarth's house, about eleven that Monday forenoon, and found his last hope extinguished on their hearth. Not seeing Hope, or a sign of her, in the farmyard, or in the empty kitchen, he rushed on to the dairy, where Dame Applegarth was skimming the milk, too much concerned at her maid's absence to complain of the extra work. At the first accents of his hurried enquiry, the first glimpse of his anxious face, she dropped the wooden bowl of cream from her hands, and clasped them together on her breast in consternation, as she cried in echo to his hasty explanation : \" Nut theer ! and nut seen sin Setterday afternuin ! Aw telt Gwordie somethin' wor wrang ; aw wur suir ef it ! Whativer con hev fa'en the lass ? \" Out ran the quiet woman into the farmyard, calling for Gilbert and Geordie in a state of unusual excitement. Then she recollected that \" the daft callant wor gyen te th' smiddy,\" and, whilst Amos darted across the road, and bounded over the copse-gate into the wood, she flew up the straggling street to seek her son, remembering only that Hope had gone away at her bidding, tliat Geordie had been lukewarm overnight, and feeling much as if whatever had happened to the girl would lie at their door. The excitement spread. Staid Dame Applegarth could not rush up the village without bringing wives to their doors, aud children after them. \" Lost on Black Fell in the fog two days sin', \" roused many a sturdy pitman who worked on tho night-shift from his forenoon dreams, to join the impromptu band of searchers who were off, along with the farmer and Geordie, long before Amos returned with leave of absence granted, and limping Gipsy at his heels."], [179, "167 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. CHAPTER V. The mind is the body's master. Amos Hedley had been afoot in the woods all night, with only an occasional rest against the bole of a tree ; had been afoot all the morning on the rugged fell with only a suggestion of breakfast ; and might well have claimed the privilege of fatigue ; but a spirit of unrest was alive within him, never to be tamed to quietude whilst Hope was missing. On his way to the head keeper he met Sir William in the grounds, near the hall, and in answer to the query : \" Whither so fast, young man ?\" told hastily the story of Hope Wolsingham's disappearance, her claims upon his gratitude, and his anxiety to renew the search for her. The baronet smiled as Amos spoke of gratitude : he had some recollection of the independent dairymaid. The required permission was given on the instant. Nature and common-sense had dictated the necessity for refreshment ; now Amos plunged Ms head in a bucket of water, ate heartily a dinner the sympathetic cook set before him, and started off afresh like a new man. Quite an hour had been consumed when, accompanied by Gipsy, he again emerged from the copse, and strode through the village on his way to the fell. The other seekers were far ahead of Mm, and something like a jealous qualm came over him lest she should be found by any but himself. His better nature, however, rebuked him, and he told Gipsy it mattered not who came first on her track, so long as she was only safe and well. The dispersed explorers had met and parted, and met again after three hours' fruitless wandering, and were, with the single exception of Gilbert Applegarth, on the point of returning to their own homes, convinced that the girl had gone astray of her own free will and not of mischance, arguing that she was most likely with old Betty at some \" kirsening,\" when the echoes of a distant shout attracted the thin ears of one, a hewer. With hands curved to mouth a loud \" Halloo ! \" was thrown forth, and re-answered back again, and the whole party hastened in the direction of the voice, quickening their steps as they saw a figure in the distance, soon recognised as the gamekeeper, running and waving his arms as if to urge them forward. Amos had already gone over the ground these others had"], [180, "168 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. taken, and known it barren. Something urged him to make fresh enquiries from the woman who had seen Hope last, and obtain an indication of the road she had taken. He had been too brief a time in the neighbourhood to know all the short cuts across the fells, and it was less his own sagacity than that of Gipsy which led him to the long spur of grey rocks where she had rested and shaken the grit out of her shoes. Here Gipsy, who had been some time uneasy, suddenly came to a stand, sniffed at the ground, looked up in Amos's face, whined, then, with Ms nose to the earth, was off as fast as his three good legs would carry him, past the point of the spur, often looking back and whining, rebelliously regardless of the keeper's whistle ; for the man and the dog were going in different directions. There was not the faintest indication of a path, but Gipsy kept on, over ground so rugged that Amos could not conceive the possibility of its being mistaken for the road even in a fog, and but for the peculiar manner of the dog, he would have declined to follow. Presently they came upon great heaps of slag and coal-dust, so long forgotten that weeds and grass had found a home there. But there was no place where Hope could lie hidden, dead or alive, unless it were that solitary clump of furze and hazel bushes in the distance. Gipsy stopped as if suddenly arrested, a movement of his long ears told that he was listening, then he stood rigid with Ms tail set, as if he had come upon his game. He gave a short sharp bark, bounded forward to reach the bushes, looked back as if to call his master, scurried here and there as if to find entrance, and barked as if he were wild. His master was quickly after him, and but that he was brought to a sudden stop by something that sounded like a far-off whisper of his own name, he might have fallen forward, and shared the fate of the poor creature perishing of cold and hunger in the depths below, so completely had the thick fringe of hazels hid the old coal-pit's yawning mouth. Thus checked, with his heart almost at a stand-still, he lay down upon the ground, and thrusting bis head into the gap between the bushes, looked searchingly down with shuddering dread. It was an awful depth, and, but that the gleaming water below served as a reflector of the sky, he might have failed to discern the dark figure seated on the beam, with white face raised so piteously to the light."], [181, "LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. 169 And now he was sure he heard his own name, faintly mingled with an imploring cry for succour ; and as he answered her cry with the one word \"Hope! \" his sudden joy at her discovery living was dashed with fears lest she should die ere rescue was possible. A faint scream rising from beneath told that he was at least heard. Again he called, and loudly, to bid her be of good cheer. Then leaving Gipsy on guard, he darted off helter-skelter, pausing oMy to send a loud halloo upon the wind from time to time, until, as he was well-nigh spent, his call was answered. The blacksmith's wife and Mrs. Applegarth had thought it ill-omened that three of the pitmen slung coils of rope around them when they joined the search ; and Amos had more than once been tempted to empty from his pockets the good things the cook had crammed them with in token of her sympathy. He had fancied the weight impeded his progress. He had cause to be thankful he was so laden. Geordie, whose long legs best fitted him for courier, was at once despatched to the village for more help and sundry appliances, and, spurred by compunction, he did not loiter by the way. There was little consultation at the mouth of the pit, where Gipsy stood like a sentry, and barked on their approach. The hazel has a tenacious grip of the soil ; its tough out spreading roots twining and interlacing. And now Amos showed himself less a novice than the pitmen deemed. He helped to splice the coils of rope, and telling them he had been bred a sea fowler on the coast, would have ventured on the descent, had not their experience told the line was far too short. One of their number, foreseeing this on his first glance downwards, had scudded off for bare life to the nearest mine at work ; but the brief afternoon had made strides as swift before the man returned with cable and comrades to help. Still there was a stretch of daylight left when Amos was slowly lowered in a rope-cradle, guiding its descent fowler-wise down the face of the shaft, wMlst anxious prayers went up to heaven from the rough beings, so prompt at the call of duty \u2014 Wesley's disciples, one and all \u2014 and Gipsy could hardly be restrained from leaping after him. He gained the bottom in safety, oMy in time to catch the form of Hope as she was dropping from her narrow perch. Expectation and joy had overtopped exhaustion ; human nature \u25a0could no longer hear the strain. When two pitmen, slung together, reached the side of the"], [182, "170 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. keeper, they found him standing more than waist-high in water, sustaining Hope with one arm, and pouring brandy down her throat from the flask of the good-natured cook. By this time a stout blanket had been brought. A sort of hammock was made, into which she was lifted, still in a state of unconsciousness ; and Amos, looping his foot in a rope stirrup, prepared for the hazardous ascent, whilst the men below steadied the impromptu cradle with a gye. There was a breatMess hush as the twain were landed clear of the hazels on the bank, and there was some doubt whether Hope was living or dead. Gipsy barked and leaped excitedly ; Farmer Applegarth's big fingers untied the girl's choking hat-strings ; Amos kneeled down and chafed her rigid hands ; the fresh air blew upon her face ; more brandy was administered ; and under the influence of one or all restoratives her languid lids unclosed. Women, as well as men, had come bare-headed from the village on hearing Geordie's news, and there was a general shout at this token of life. The men then turned with a will to release their captive brethren, and by the time they were landed, Hope was eating ravenously the bread and meat from Amos Hedley' s pockets, soaked though they had been in the pit. She was carried home to the farm in Dame Applegarth's own locking-chair, and there was no lack of volunteers for the service. But Amos, who had felt his own strength collapse when there was no longer a demand upon it, was content, like Gipsy, to walk beside, and now and then stretch out a hand to wrap closer around her the blanket which the rising wind displaced. Hope was too feeble for many words, but her thanks had been sufficiently eloquent, and Amos was doubly blest. Wet, cold, hunger, exposure, and enforced wakefulness for eight-and-forty hours, would try the strongest woman's frame. Hope was on the verge of a fever ; and when the first use she found for speech was to bid Amos hasten to Sir William, and warn Mm that Nick Faw and the two escaped poachers were going to break into the hall that very night, she was accredited with delirium. She said she had thought of little else all the while she was down the pit, and implored him to lose no time in warning his master. But he lingered incredulous, and she grew impatient. And then, as fever grew, her mind did begin to wander, and all her pent-up love was unsealed, and found unconscious utterance in broken words and ejaculations of alternate fear and gratitude. She was once more in the darksome pit, cramping on her narrow perch, and yet afraid to move a"], [183, "171 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. limb lest she should have a fresh struggle with the icy water below her ; praying for deliverance, and crying that she should die, and Amos would not scorn her then. Anon she implored Nick Faw and Joey Dobson not to murder Amos \u2014 to spare the poor doggie \u2014 anon she muttered fragments of the nefarious colloquy by the rocky ridge on the hill-side, with self-gratulations that she had overheard it all. Then she was fleeing from pursuit ; now falling, falling into the bottomless pit ; every now and again she would look wildly round and shriek for Amos to save her \u2014 not to let her die there of cold and hunger ! It was all a disjointed tangle, pitiable to listen to, as evidence of the ordeal she had undergone, and the fever that ran riot through her veins ; yet such is the inconsistency of man, that a thrill of satisfaction stirred the pulses of Amos at her unconscious admissions, in spite of the new dread lest she should be lost as soon as found. She had been laid on a huge blue-and-white check-covered' squab or sofa in the kitchen, and had not yet been removed to her own low-roofed bedroom under the eaves. The fire had been piled up high to warm and welcome her, and the whole attendant crowd had taken possession of the apartment, freely discussing Hope's marvellous deliverance and the sagacity of Gipsy, in tones fitter for the hill-side than the sensitive nerves of a woman in her prostrate condition. Mrs. Applegarth, mimstering to her immediate needs, grew uneasy as she listened to her and to them. Geordie came from the cellar with two great pitchers of ale, and the farmer busied himself to place half a cheese and a big loaf on the table ; but it needed only a hint from the dame to carry ale and edibles into the barn, with the crowd in their rear. And there Geordie was left to play host, Gilbert returning to help his good dame. Thus it chanced that Hope's utterances fell into no strange ears except those of a kindly old neighbour (herself as deaf as a post), who remained to chafe the girl's benumbed limbs, whilst Mrs. Applegarth prepared a hot buttermilk posset by way of food and physic. At first Amos was disposed to put Sir William on his guard on Hope's suggestion ; but, when she grew palpably incoherent, he was half inclined to fall in with the farmer's notion, that the \" puir wench's brain wor torned,\" he had best \" neet fash th' maister for nowt,\" and reluctantly left her to her nurses at last, to turn the question over in his own mind as he dragged Ms tired limbs tinough the park homewards to the hall. Yet, if Hope had heard, and heard aright, the robbers were to make the attack that very mght. \u2014 Hark !"], [184, "172 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. CHAPTER VI. Hark ! A dry twig cracked under a heavy foot ; a hare, startled from its sleep, scurried past him ; Gipsy gave a low growl and stood still. Amos had borrowed the farmer's gun, and now held it ready : there were certainly strangers in the planting. To put it to the test he gave a peculiar signal whistle. There was no response. A fellow-keeper would have answered. He stood for a minute or two with his gun at half-cock ; then, .as if thoroughly reassured, pursued his course, with Gipsy limping beside him, quite as weary as his master, though not one wMt more content or satisfied. As usual, Amos had entered the planting by the copse-gate ; the cut thence across the park saved at least a third the distance of the road-proper. To-night he stood in need of rest, but now he was on the alert, and wide awake. Coupling that stealthy tread with the growl of the dog, and Hope's communication, he was inclined to pay more heed to her warning, and felt how necessary it was he should reach the hall without arousing suspicion in the evil minds so near to him. He stepped on boldly as if on ordinary duty, loitering now and then, and patting Gipsy with a pleasant word ; apparently going farther away into the covert, yet drawing nearer to the open park with every step. Once away from the shadow of the trees he made direct for the hall, pondering how best to get immediate speech with Sir William without first running the gauntlet of the servants' hall. He was anticipated. The baronet had given orders that immediately on the gamekeeper's return he should be shown into the library. There he found Sir William seated at a large table, with books and papers before him, and two or three money-bags at Ms elbow, which had been that day paid in by Ms steward. Shutters were fastened, curtains drawn, the fire glowed, the wax-lights in the silver candelabra were repeated in the glazed fronts of ponderous book-cases ; and as Sir William half turned in his chair to greet the new-comer, Amos had a vision of a struggle for the bags upon the table, and the words, \" silence with the knife,\" came into his mind with painful suggestiveness. \"And so the young woman is found! I'm glad of it! And where was it, Hedley ; and how came it all about ? You must tell me the whole story,\" and the baronet smiled pleasantly, \"for your lady will not bate a jot of the news, and I shall have to"], [185, "173 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. retail it. Lady Derwent is greatly interested in your \u2014 sweetheart shall we say ? \" It was impossible to answer all the baronet's cordial questions at once, and Amos hesitated. There was a look of gravity on the young man's face, as well as an utterly exhausted droop of his shoulders. There was wine on the table. Struck by some thing in the young man's voice or manner Sir William filled a wine-glass from a decanter on the table, and bade him drink that before he began, it would \"put heart into him.'' But he had already begun. His tale would not brook delay. Brief!}* and modestly he told the story of anxious quest, attributing the credit of Hope's recovery entirely to the sagacity of Gipsy, and dwelt more on the pitiable condition in which the lost girl was found, than on the adventurous descent of himself and others. His master's commiseration was roused, but its expression was arrested as Amos unexpectedly drew close, and, leaning one hand on the table, bent down to tell in lowered tones that Hope had fallen into the old pit in endeavouring to evade Nick Faw and two others, who had planned, in her hearing, to break into Derwentside Hall that very mght, for plunder, and it might be \u2014 murder also. Sir William grasped the arms of his chair and half rose from Ms seat, aghast and coMounded, as he well might be. But he was a brave man, and after that first surprised start, listened with apparent composure, whilst Amos went on to say that he had heard strange footsteps in the wood, and believed the wretches were lurking there in readiness. \"No doubt, no doubt,\" acquiesced Sir William; \"and we must be ready too,\" he added, with his hand on the embroidered bell-pull. Thwaites, the pompous old butler, came at the summons. He had been a servant in the family from boyhood. In horror and amazement he uplifted his fat hands, unable to comprehend the enormity of a burglary at Derwentside. But he was alive to the need for promptitude and caution. With Amos in tow he left the library to carry out instructions. Cook had a substantial supper ready for Amos. Men and women servants crowded round to ply him with questions. It was ten o'clock. Lady Derwent had rung for her maid half an hour. \" To bed, to bed, you chattering women-folk,\" cried Thwaites. \" It is long past time. Sir William wants the house quiet ; he has Mr. Ramsay's accounts to overlook.\" He was imperative. The maids retired grumbling, the house keeper following, with a light in a wire screen, as was her custom,"], [186, "174 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. in order to secure the extinction of other candles. All bolts and bars had been previously adjusted, and to an outside spectator the household appeared to sink into mght's torpor and quiescence as usual. When the coast was clear, Sir William and the butler armed the men servants with cudgels or pistols ; and with many a charge to be silent, placed them two and two in the lower rooms, the point of attack being as uncertain as the number of the robbers. Derwentside Hall was a plain stone edifice, with a flagged pavement on three sides, whilst the other overhung the river, at an elevation, and so was safe from attack. It had been calculated that footsteps, however stealthy, woMd be heard upon tMs pave- ment ; but the men had come with muffled feet, and the first intimation of their approach was the sound of a file on the unglazed grating of the larder window. Iron, woodwork, and wirework were all old, the operator skilful ; ere long the framework gave way with little noise. Someone crushed through the gap, and dropped on padded feet \u2014 a second followed \u2014 a third ; the flash of a lantern gleamed on the passage walls ; there was a stoppage at the butler's pantry, a jingle of keys, as if the lock was being picked, a low-voiced suggestion to make sure of the coin first, it was safest ; and then the three ruffians passed into the large kitchen on their way to the opposite door, the one with the dark lantern in the rear. There was a dull red glow in the heart of the recently-slaked fire which barely cast a light on the bright iron fender and white hearth, leaving the corners of the great kitchen in deep shadow. As the third man stole in, Amos, who stood ready, closed the door behind him, shadowy forms darted from every corner, and the intruders found themselves in a trap. \" Surrender, you vagabonds ! \" cried Sir William, and the cock of a pistol was heard to enforce command. \" Nivvor ! \" roared the leader ; \" it be thee or me for it,\" and darted forward to throw himself on the baronet, whose voice had revealed his whereabouts. There was the gleam of a kmfe, the flash of a pistol, and Sir William was down with a ruffianly hand on his throat. Already he felt the sharp prick of a blade, when the man's arm was clutched from behind, there was a grip of a powerful hand on his collar, he was dragged to his feet, and hurled across the kitchen, where he struck against and overturned a chair in falling. He rose and again rushed forward, but his knife was gone, and when he closed with Amos, the two grappled together, with only their"], [187, "LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. 175 natural weapons, and on equal terms, barring the fatigue of the latter. In the general scuffle their individual conflict was unobserved. It was not until the other burglars had succumbed to stout cudgels in stout hands, in spite of their lethal weapons, and the crape was torn from the faces of Mat Laing and Joey Dobson, that their captors had breathing-time to note the desperate struggle on the hearth. But by that time it was nearly over, Amos had succeeded in bringing Ms antagonist to the ground, his head had struck tbe fender in falling, Ms hat had fallen off, and Nick Faw lay there stunned. He was not killed, however, and had fared little worse than Amos, who had got an ugly scratch with the knife in wresting it from Mm. The butler, too, had pretty nearly got his quietus, or thought he had, but it was from the chance hit of a friendly cudgel, and the knives had not otherwise done much damage. Those were hanging days. When the three ruffians were hauled off to the county gaol the next morning under a strong escort, they knew they were journeying to the gallows, and that they would be too heavily ironed to escape this time. Penitent enough were the two poachers, who had been led into the more daring attempt bj the prospect of plunder and revenge, under the inspiration of Nick Faw ; but the hardened tinker, scow*ling and sullen, only opened his mouth in blasphemy. Amos, whose hand smarted under bandages, could not resist the temptation to tell the man how their plot had been overheard, and how the lass who heard would have been lost but for the poor dog they had thrown so wantonly at the baited bull. Aye, and mayhap if the doggie had never wanted nursing, it would have known nothing of Hope or her kindness. Nick Faw had certainly twined a rope for his own neck when he tMew the dog to be gored. The man glared at the speaker, and bit at him like a savage ; and Gipsy having forced his way amongst the crowd at the back of the hall, as he and his companions were led away in custody, he put out his foot and dealt the animal a brutal kick. He had again reckoned without his host. Gipsy darted after him, and made him feel that woollen stockings were bad armour against canine fangs. Sir William's wound was scarcely more severe than that of his gamekeeper, though but for the latter's promptitude, it might have been fatal. The baronet's gratitude, and that of Lady Derwent, could not be expended in words. He dealt immediate rewards"], [188, "176 LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. to the other domestics who had taken part in the capture of the burglars and the defence of his property, but he told Amos he should have to think how best to serve him and his sweetheart \u2014 as he persisted in calling Hope Wolsingham. In the first place he left him at liberty, until his hand was healed, to go where he would, and quickly as feet could span the distance Amos was at Applegarth's farm. An hour later Sir William and Lady Derwent met him at the farmer's gate as he was rushing in a state of distraction to find old Betty Wolsingham. She was wanted to try her skill on her own grandchild, whose fever had not abated. Dame Applegarth lauded the wondrous condescension of the lady in mounting the dark stairs to Hope's small chamber in the roof, and laying vinegar- cloths on the maid's forehead with her \" awn lily-white honds,\" but the lady felt as if the girl was suffering for her, and as if she ow*ed her a husband's life. Geordie, who had not ceased to deplore his inactivity in the first instance, was ready enough to fling his long legs over a bare-backed horse, and ride off' for Sir William's doctor; and by the time Dr. Blackett's three-cornered hat and gold-headed cane reached the farm, old Betty was there to act as nurse under his instructions, though she felt strongly tempted to trust to her own remedies and ignore him altogether. Fever and delirium ran high ; over and over again the girl went through her frightful experience on fell and in pit, but in all such genuine anxiety for the people at the hall was apparent, so much affection for Amos Hedley, which he was \" sure niwor te ken,\" that the sternest heart would have melted with pity, and Amos, kneeling by her bed-side, sobbed again. For a long while her life trembled in the balance, but what the skill of the time and loving hands coMd do was done for her ; she was young, had a strong constitution ; the crisis passed, and left her to regain strength, and to discover that she had a lover by her side w*ho poured out his heart as if he knew the depth of hers. She was not voted well enough to enter the witness-box at the winter gaol -delivery. The men had gone armed to Derwentside, had broken in, had picked a lock, fought and wounded the mmates of the hall, and their sentence came from under the judge's black cap. Her evidence was not needed. At the beginning of the year, Sir William announced to Amos that he had a farm on his hands for which he wanted a tenant ; it was well stocked, and might be had on a long lease for a small rental ; and he thought Amos might venture on it, with Hope as his helpmate."], [189, "LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG. 177 And so it came about. Hope wore at her wedding the ribbons Amos had bought from the pedlar ; and Gipsy was handed over to them, along with the lease of the farm, to be petted and spoiled by master and mistress \u2014 and by the children, too, when they came. N"], [190, "THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. CHAPTER I. \"And so our Jack wants to be married,\" quoth James Sutton, the thrifty builder, between the whiffs of his pipe, to his natty fresh-coloured little wife, as the pah sat together in the twilight, at the close of a warm day in the early summer, mhaling the sea-breeze through the open window, and looking out on the shipping in the Downs, and on the nearer-moving panorama, with that sort of unobservant sight which comes of long familiarity. Sailors called to their mates as they haMed their boats high and dry on the beach, and made all taut forthemght, sauntered off singly homewards, or in groups to the nearest ale- house ; soldiers and recrmts hastened past with quickemng steps towards the barracks ; young men and women lounged about the esplanade, or strolled along the pier ; whooping boys and girls chased each other roughly in and out the crowd, to the annoy- ance of quiet pedestrians ; carts and flies rumbled past, but unless the last were luggage-laden, or some acquaintance stopped to say \" Good morning,\" the couple took little or no note of the shifting scene before them. It was their wont so to sit when work was over and the room was not more profitably occupied ; and that evening their minds were so intent on the matrimomal proposition with which we started, that it is doubtful whether they were not utterly blind to external objects. \" And so our Jack wants to be married,\" he repeated in a sort of soliloquy, as he beat the ashes out of his pipe on the window sill. \" Well, when a man's seven-and-twenty it's about time.

I've got on in the world without cant and psalm-singing, and our lad may do the same.\" Mrs. Sutton had some dim thoughts of preparation for another world, and her lips parted for speech, but closed again in silence. He went on, \" Ewells, indeed ! Our Jack's as good as the Ewells any day, or Aaron Fagg, either ! But who told him all this ? Maybe it's oMy a trick of the girl's to make our Jack speak out.

No, no ; old folk are best by themselves, and young folk are best by themselves.\" So saying, he knocked the ashes out of his pipe once more, and did not re-fill it, but sat cogitating, whilst his wife, who was used to his manner, made no reply one way or other, but bestirred herself about supper, and left him to his ruminations, which must have been of a mixed character, as he frowned and chuckled by turns. James Sutton had passed his sixtieth year, but he was a stout hearty man, given to boast that he had not a grey hair in his head, and had never had a day's illness since he cut those sound white second-teeth of his. He had a round, somewhat rubicund face, lit by eyes that twinkled and blmked ; but he had closely shut lips, which kept the secrets of the twfrdding stars to them selves. He was not altogether an ill-humoured fellow, but, like many other men who have risen from small beginnings, he had profound faith in himself, and be sure he had a will of his own. He kept his workmen and his household in subjection, less from any demonstrative parade of authority than his habit of looking more than he said, and acting on his unspoken thoughts. Thus it was that his only son, Jack, a slighter-built counter part of himself, although twenty-seven, preferred mooting the momentous question of his marriage through the medium of his mother, to a personal conference in which he was likely to have all the talk to himself, and to know nothing of the paternal mind when he had unlocked his own. \" You must wait patiently, Jack, and don't fidget,\" she said to her son, whom she found pulling off his boots in the kitchen, with a degree of irritability not at all usual in him. \" He said our plan would not do.\" \" Ah ! I expected as much ! \" jerked out Jack, kicking his harmless boot across the hearth. \" Well, he didn't say one word agamst the wedding, nor one word against Mary, and I saw by the corners of his mouth and the twinkle in his eye, he'd got some notion m his head better than ours. It'll be all right m the end, Jack, take my word for it.\" \" K it don't, I shall be off to sea, or enlist, before long. If I'd worked for a stranger, and had fair wages, I might have put something by to start with, but I coMdn't ask Mary to leave a good home, with no prospect before us. And I'm not going to stay and see her married against her will to that lanky, hypo-"], [193, "THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. 181 -critical sneak, Aaron. How he has got round her brothers puzzles me. I coidd not get a word with her to-night, for he and Stephen Ewell stood together, propping up the doorway, and Steve coolly told me Mary was not coming out, she would be better engaged ! \" So saying, Jack betook himself to bed, without candle, and with out supper. A plump, rosy blossom was Mary Ewell, with clear hazel eyes, fresh complexion, and soft brown hair, smoothly banded over a broad reflective forehead, with feet and hands well shaped, though the latter showed their acquamtance with rough work. She was more than six years the junior of Jack Sutton, and he had been courting her, aster a fashion, since she was sixteen. He had made her acquaintance, in the first instance, one sunny day, when she had carried a basket of newly-washed clothes to be dried on the beach, strewing clean pebbles on the outspread articles to keep them down on the shingle. She had either miscalcMated the strength of the breeze, or the weight of the pebbles employed ; or, startled by Jack's appearance from behind her father's lugger, loosed her hold prematurely, and away went a half-dried garment before the wind, and Jack aster it. Anyone who has had the pleasure to wade through shingle may suppose the venturous article of apparel had the best of it, though both he and she took up the chase. He was, however, not inclined to be beaten, and the check apron was finally restored to her, with good-humoured laughter on both sides. From that small act of involuntary courtesy acquaintance grew, but it was not until the ghi's father was washed overboard one stormj* night, when the lugger had gone to the rescue of a schooner wrecked on the Goodwin Sands, that his friendship \u25a0drifted through the gates of pity into love. In comforting Mary, he lost his heart altogether. That terrible night had exercised a memorable influence on the family of the Ewells. The fact of life's uncertainty had come home to them. The greedy sea, with many a gaping mouth, cried out that a sailor should ever hold himself prepared ; and they listened to its voice. They had never been wild or riotous, but they henceforth became serious and devout ; they allowed neither drink nor profligacy on board the lugger, of which they took possession, with none of the disputes common among brothers, working together with a will for mutual benefit, and the maintenance of mother and sister. But the elder had brought his wife into the old house, and she \u2014 the sharp-tongued sister of Aaron Fagg \u2014 was the one most anxious to secure Mary for her brother."], [194, "182 THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. Between the Faggs and Suttons was an old-standing grudge, relative to a plot of ground, containing a wooden shed, which had been put up to auction, and finally knocked down to James Sutton, aster a smart competition between the two men. The sailmaker chafed at losing a convenient place for his occupation, and hinted at collusion between auctioneer and buyer. The builder pressed teeth and lips together, and in Ms silent way made it obvious that he thought he had \" paid too much for his whistle,\" and loved Aaron Fagg none too well for running up the price of the lot. The introduction of Aaron's pretensions to Mary Ewell was therefore a shrewd stroke of Mrs. Sutton's. She knew that, barring Mary \u2014 who had somehow won her way into the good graces of father as well as son \u2014 her husband held the Ewells in contempt, as \" setting themselves up to be better than other people,\" and that if he had not absolutely forbidden the courtship, he had done his best to throw cold w*ater upon it, and retard the very crisis which had arrived. In small provincial towns, everybody born and bred upon the spot knows everybody else, more or less, and ever since Mrs. Sutton had joined with Jack in comforting Mary, when her father was washed overboard, the young girl had been received as a companion of Jack's sisters. When the last of these fled on hymeneal wings, Mary had seemed to fill a void in the motherly heart, and Mrs. Sutton was scarcely less eager than Jack that she should fill the void in the house also. She knew, moreover, that nothing was so likely to win her husband's assent, and bring that about, as the prospect of disappointing Aaron Fagg. It was not playing upon the best qualities of his nature, but she was human and fallible, as well as her husband, and neither thought of seeking Divine guidance in the matter. When supper was ready that evening there was no one to partake of it. Jack had gone to bed to chew the cud of jealousy and impatience in solitude, and James Sutton had betaken himself to the open air to give his imagination freer range. Mrs. Sutton might not have let lodgings had he been a builder on an extensive scale ; still, he had risen above the social level of the Ewells, and regarded his countenance of Mary as somewhat of a condescension, whatever it might have been years before. That they should reject an alliance with his son was a novel experience. With his hands in his pockets, giving an occasional chink to the coin therein, he paced the Beach roadway from end to end, then back again, then strolled beyond the coast-guard station, where a row of stoutly-built luggers drawn up like"], [195, "THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. 183 a file of marines ready for emergency, on the one hand, and a succession of black sheds on the other, made the air odorous with their tarry stores. Here it was that Aaron Fagg had found a more desirable location than the \" lot \" for which the builder had been the successful bidder. Before the wide doors of this place the latter stood with legs astride some five minutes, when he retraced his steps, and presently turned abruptly down one of the narrow rugged passages which intersect the three main thoroughfares, and assume to be considered streets. This was little better than an alley, narrow, dark, ill-paved, and worse lighted ; yet the houses, though irregular, time-worn, and incongruous, were neither poor, squalid, nor ill-tenanted. They were for the most part scrupulously clean, and on one or two doors brass plates stood boldly forth to catch the struggling moonbeams, as if to vaunt the owner's claim to respectability. \" Aaron Fagg, Sailmaker,\" slowly and deliberately read out James Sutton from one of these brazen vouchers, with the addendum of an anathema which it is needless to particularise, since he muttered it between set teeth. About a score or two of paces further on he stopped again, where, across the way, Mary L well's slight figure might be seen drawing down the white blind behind a row of red flower-pots, leaving the window still partially open. His steps were arrested in part by the loud incisive voice of her elder brother Stephen, and the sound of his own name, in tones like those of a sea-trumpet in a storm. Old Mrs. Ewell was somewhat deaf, and her son was evidently addressing her. \"I tell you what, mother, James Sutton has no God but Mammon. He cannot go along the streets without rattling the money in bis pockets as if to tell you so.\" [The listener involuntarily drew forth his hands from those receptacles.] \" But catch him putting a shilling into the poor-box ! Indeed, he hardly ever shows his face inside a church door, and that Jack of his be not much better. Catch him there if he didn't go in the wake of Mary.\" There was a response in lower tones, of which he only caught the import that it was neither just nor CMistian-like to sit in judgment on their neighbours. \" Maybe not, Mary ; but when I see my sister bent on her own destruction, and keeping company with idolaters and blasphemers, like the Suttons, it's my duty to speak out [\"They are not idolaters and blasphemers, at least Jack is not,\" interjected Mary, correcting herself] ; and if I,\" Stephen went on, \"sent Jack Sutton about his business to-night, it was all for your own good.\""], [196, "184 THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. Another voice chimed in. It was that of Aaron Fagg's sister. \" And much thanks you've got. If she chooses to throw herself away on a fellow with neither money nor a home to take her to, let her. I am sure our Aaron, with his steady character, let alone his good house and business, has no need to go begging for a wife. There's plenty of girls would snap at him.\" \"I dare say,\" was assented wearily ; \" but I'm not going to run off my promise to Jack for anybody.\" \" If she doesn't she's a brick ! \" was the builder's mental ejaculation, as once more thrusting bis hands in his trousers pockets, he turned upon his heel. \" She's a staunch lass, quiet as she looks. I wonder, now, how long she coMd stand that badgering without giving in ? Driving nails through inch planking is nothing to that Orpha's tongue. If Mary has patience to put np with that, our Jack has not made a bad Hullo ! He had run against a man in the semi-darkness. It was long legged Aaron Fagg, on his way across to the other house for the second time that night. He was certaiMy very much in earnest, but then, he was not personally very desirable, and Mary was. Nearly a week elapsed. Mrs. Sutton let her apartments, and was too busy to notice the restlessness of Jack, or the peculiar \" knowingness \" of her undemonstrative husband ; and still Jack's questions were unanswered, and he was growing desperate m s ispense. The little office of his father, in a by-street, had an outer window overlooking the timber yard, and an inner one overlooking the carpenter's shop. In this latter Jack was busy with rule and pencil, making some calculations which would not come right (for his mind was astray), when the word \" Jack ! \" startled him like an electric shock. \"I suppose he wants me about that contract of Cavell's,\" thought Jack, as he obeyed the call. His father took no notice of his entrance. After awhile, the younger man said, somewhat curtly, for he was not in a comfortable frame of mind, \"I'm waiting.\" \" I know you are,\" said his father, turning round on his stool, his eyes all in a twinkle with some notion of his own, \" and so is Mary Ewell, and so is Aaron Fagg, and the question is, who'll tire first ? \" Taken by surprise, Jack flushed hotly, then answered boldly enough, \" / shall ! Unless I can marry Mary, and bring her home, with a fair prospect of keeping her, I shall ! I'm not going to stay until she is worried into marrying Aaron Fagg. And so, father,\" his voice toned down, \" if you are not willing to give me higher wages, and something to furnish a house with, or to let"], [197, "THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOF HIMSELF. 185 me bring Mary home to mother, I mean to walk up to the barracks and enlist ! \" And he looked as if he meant it. \" Well, you needn't be in such a hurry all at once. I was older than you before I took a wife. I saved some money before I married.\" \"Aye ! \" cried Jack, bitterly, \"but you had fair wages, and didn't work for your father.\" James Sutton swung round to his desk, his lips pressed close. Jack had evidently touched him. Presently be said in another key, \" Well, maybe so, Jack. But I waited, and you will have to wait,\" \u2014 Jack uttered an impatient expletive \u2014 \" not very long\" \u2014 \" Mary Ewell is too good for Aaron Fagg, but wait until I can build a house for myself and your mother, and then I'll turn the old place, furniture and all, over to you and your wife, and perhaps take you mto partnership at the same time.\" And he put out his hand to Jack, his eyes blinking like stars. Taken by surprise, Jack was almost too much overpowered to grasp the extended hand. Here was consent, and a definite prospect held out to him, on which he could boldly put in his claim to Mary, in the teeth of Aaron Fagg. Hitherto, his love makmg had been of the most unsatisfactory character, even to the two lovers \u2014 everytMng was so vague, except their own love and fidelity. Back, in another frame of mind, he went into the workshop with Ms rule and pencil ; and James Sutton, well pleased with the notion that he had \" put Aaron Fagg'spipe out,\" took himself off to watch the progress of his workmen on a row of stucco-fronted dwellings he was building on contract ; and thence betook himself to a land-agent's, where he began to haggle and dispute over the price of a crazy old tenement and the ground it stood upon. Finally, he screwed up Ms mouth, and with his hands in his pockets, walked away, the bargam incomplete, fully expecting the seller to come down to his offer m a few days, if he only waited and made no sign. The result proved his sagacity, and so he got the site for his new house much below its value. Of course he had not stated his object in buying. But buymg was one thing and building another. To do the latter, consent had to be gained, wMch he had not thought of asking. The crazy old house had a tenant almost as old and crazy, and this tenant notoMy objected to quit, but snapped her bony fingers in James Sutton's face, and told him \" she had been born in the house and meant to die there ; she paid her rent, and would keep possession.\""], [198, "186 THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. The old woman was neither to be persuaded, threatened, cajoled, nor bought out. She \"paid her rent, and there she meant to stay.\" Fagg was the cognomen of this defiant dame \u2014 at once an octogenarian, and the grandmother of Aaron Fagg, the sail maker ! The nice little tune James Sutton proposed to play on his whistle for the gratification of the Faggs stopped at the first bar. For once in his life, the builder confessed to himself that he was \"floored.\" He screwed his lips tighter, thrust Ms hands deeper into his pockets, rattled his money more persistently, walked in and out of the office and timber-yard, thence to the half-fimshed cottages he had in hand, till both Jack and his men grew weary of his excessive vigilance. At home, he sat with Ms pipe in his mouth, silent and cogitative ; visitors objected to the fumes, but he stuck to his pipe as if inspiration lodged in its bowl. From the time he announced to son and wife his intention to build a fine house for himself, to \" take the shine out of the Faggs and Ewells,\" and offered to turn the existing one over to Jack as it stood, at a low rent, from that time he had said no more on the subject. There were not, however, wanting lips or tongues to spread the news that he had \" actually bought old Granny Fagg's house over her head, and threatened to turn her out neck and crop ; as if there wasn't waste land enough in the parish, without coveting the poor old widow's home.\" Jack and his mother heard, and for different reasons were ruffled at the hearing, but they had no voice in the matter. The Ewells had. They, Orpha especially, refused to credit Mary's assertion that Jack had not prompted the step, and, in confirmation, brought forward the significant fact, that his proposal for her had been backed by the assurance that his father was about to take him into partnership, build a new house for himself, and turn the old one over to him and his young wife, provided he could have her. He must have known where the new house was to be built, they maintained, and it looked like hitting his rival with a side-wind."], [199, "THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. 187 CHAPTER H. The brothers Ewell were by no means the harsh, ill-conditioned fellows the Suttons considered them. If they lived in a dark aud crooked thoroughfare their lives were neither dark nor crooked. Their manners were rough, as was their calling ; but in warning Mary against Jack Sutton, and urging the pretensions of Aaron Fagg, they had no more sinister motive than any other brothers who wish their sister well, and prefer to strengthen existing relations with a man well esteemed in matters of money and religion, rather than one credited with small capital of either. When Jack, on the very Thursday evening he had taken part in that brief but important colloquy in his father's cramped office, laid his prospects and proposals frankly before Stephen and Sam, as they stood on the shingle in the shadow of their broad beamed boat, which had just been hauled up on the beach, they hesitated, and debated one with the other, but w*ere neither gruff nor surly. It placed him in a new light. It was clear he was not \" trifling with the lass,\" and would be in all worldly con siderations as good a match as Aaron. And Mary's leaning was towards the younger man. But there were unworldly considera tions these brothers brought mto the question, and with some gravity they said they \" woMd talk it over at home with the women folk. They could not answer him right off.\" Pending the family decision less stringent watch was kept on Mary herself. No one opposed his walking beside her from St. George's Church on the Sunday, or made any disagreeable comments when, during the week, she went forth in the evenings avowedly to meet him. No one, that is, except her sister-in-law, and she stoutly opposed her brother's rival. But when it was buzzed about that Granny Fagg's rickety wooden house was to be levelled, to make room for James Sutton's new one, a change came over the Ew*ells one and all. The next evening, when Mary met Jack as usual on the Sandown road, he saw that she had been weeping. There are not many leafy groves for lovers in the neighbourhood of Deal, but a treeless, houseless road may serve their turn, if travellers be few and far between, whilst eavesdropping is impossible. Jack saw these signs of disquiet as he drew her willing arm withm his, and kept her hand still in his clasp, walking over the rough pebbly road, regardless of the glorious sunset to their right, or the shadows gathering over the sea to their left, all absorbed in their own emotions and perplexities. He had some"], [200, "188 THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. difficulty in drawing from her the secret of her evident distress ; and her tears flowed afresh as she told him the news Aaron Fagg had brought, that his grandmother's house and garden had been bought by Jack's father, and that he, James Sutton, threatened to turn the old woman out ; that he had bought it more to spite the Faggs, Aaron especially, than because it was an eligible property ; and that Orpha and her brothers accused her dear Jack of bemg a party to the unrighteous plot agamst the aged widow. Of course she did not believe it, but nothmg she could say would convmce her relations ; and the upshot was, that instead of consenting to their marriage, both her mother and brothers forbade her having the slightest intercourse with a family so evil-minded as the Suttons. Had her faith in her lover been less assured than it was, the amazement on his face must have been convincing, without his open disclaimer of complicity or knowledge. Beneath the Sandown windmill they sat down on the grass to consider what was best to be done, she expressing her belief that after this they would insist on her marrying Aaron Fagg. \" And rather than that,\" she said, with a shudder, \" I would run away to London and take a situation.\" \" Nay,\" sighed Jack, drawing her closer to him, \" that would never do. London is an awful place for a young girl without friends. If the worst came to the worst we could but get married on the quiet. But you will be of age in six months, and then you can please yourself. You must have patience with them a little longer, Mary, for my sake. I would take you away from them now, if I could. At all events I can go at once, Mary, to Stephen, and try to convmce them that I know less of my own father's plans than they seem to do. Come,\" and raising her from the grass he led her brisMy forward, whilst the shadows deepened over sea and land, and, like tiny sparks, one by one the lights of ships and beacons glimmered across the waters and the treacherous Goodwin Sands. Stephen and Sam Ewell, previously prejudiced, were now \u25a0doggedly set against their young sister's choice \" Like father, like son,\" said they, rejecting with scorn his protestations that he was utterly ignorant of his father's intentions or transactions. \" Do not add lying to revenge and oppression,\" cried Stephen. \" As well might Jehoram, the son of Ahab, have excused himself when Naboth's vineyard was taken. But the sins of his father clung to him, and in Naboth's vineyard did the judgment of the Lord overtake him.\" Jack Sutton' s acquaintance with Scripture history was"], [201, "THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. 189 unfortunately limited. His religious training had begun and ended at school. Thrift had been ever the dominant principle in his home ; thrift, regulated by a sort of pagan morality. But, beyond the prayers his mother had taught him in his infancy, religious ballast he had none. The parable was dark. Still he was conscious of some hidden reference, and its source. He turned on his heel abruptly, not caring either to betray his want ot Biblical knowledge or to quarrel with Mary' a brothers ; whilst Stephen, comparing himself to the \" man who drew his bow at a venture, and smote the Mng of Israel between the joints of his harness,\" proceeded with the adjustment of his tackle, well satisfied with his random shot. He had drawn his bow at a venture, but the shaft had been differently feathered than he knew. Jack, resentftdly conscious of insult, which his ignorance made Mm powerless to rebut, went home to hunt impatiently amongst neglected school-books for a Bible, and then set himself sedulously to the task of self-enlightenment. His intent went no further than the episode of Naboth's vineyard ; but, in the course of his uninformed search for that, he found so much to mterest and awaken that, unknown to man or woman, he began, like Timothy, to search the Scriptures \u2014 at first for history oMy, then for edification, but he studied m secret, in spare half-hours, and his progress was slow, as was its influence on his life. Meanwhile his father, heedless of the opmions of others, and fully persuaded in his own mind that by legal right of purchase his moral right was stronger than the occupant's right, either legal or moral, set about his task of turning out Granny Fagg, resenting with unwonted asperity the remonstrances of both wife and son. \" Hold your tongue, you young fool, or you may wait till doomsday for Mary Ewell ! Eor marry you shall not, with my consent, till I have built my house and taught Aaron Fagg the value of ' land.' \" Granny was duly served with a notice to quit (hers was a monthly tenancy), then with a formal notice of ejectment, but she tore up both legal instruments with scorn, and continued to hold her own persistently, and James Sutton declared that she was backed up in her resistance by Aaron Fagg. At all events she insisted she was \"neither to be driven out nor bought out.\" Thus defied, the builder set men to unroof the tenement, thinking to drive her forth. At once she had her bed and belongings carried to the floor below, and prepared for a siege. She had a large piece of old sailcloth stretched from wall to wall beneath"], [202, "190 THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. the bare rafters to shut out the sky and its contributions, and still refused to budge, though the weather was breaking up and thunderstorms beat down the sailcloth, converting the narrow staircase into a cascade. And now her grandson, fearing for her life, counselled her to yield, offered her a home with him, urged the approach of the autumnal equinox, and said that old bones like hers needed shelter from the blasts. No use ! Granny Fagg was as dogged as James Sutton. She declared she would stay there till she died in spite of him. And so she did. He had the windows removed. She covered the apertures with quilts and trays, and finally Aaron, who made the battle his own, nailed sailcloth in the gaps. These excluded light, but could not bar the wind, which, searching through the crannies, blew out her candles and racked her old frame with rheumatism and asthma, though the flame of her resentftd obduracy burned fiercely as ever. But wind and weather were stronger than old Granny Fagg, and one October morning, after a blusterous pelt ing night, she was found dead in her bed, her bony fingers clutching the coverlet, on which water was dropping through the seams of the floor above, whilst her sailcloth shutters and chintz bed-curtains flapped and beat noisily in the spent breeze, their dirge unheard. La such storms it is that the Deal boatmen make their harvests, reaping the seas and gathering life and other salvage from the billows. There were corses and wreckage on the coast, there were rescued mariners to shelter, disabled vessels to succour, dis mantled ones to refit with bolts or cables, sails or anchors, and in the excitement on the shore the inland wreck might have been overlooked. But for that which the sea wrought Deal was prepared\u2014 for that which human elements brought about it had no precedent, and stood virtuously aghast. Aaron Fagg counted his gains by the storm on land and sea, and gave orders for his grandmother's funeral in the same hour. Far and wide Ms invitations went, and far and wide his filial piety was exalted, and James Sutton's harsh brutality denounced, popular prepossession or prejudice seldom making deductions. Aaron did not publish to the funeral train how much coin of the realm he had found stitched in the saturated woollen coverlet over the dead, or what profit he had made by the new sails Ms brother- m-law had carried for him to the distressed brigantine in the roadstead ; and he did not say how far he had encouraged his grandmother to rebel, or what"], [203, "THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. 191 money equivalent James Sutton had tendered for peaceable possession before taMng extreme measures. True, he did not revile his rival, or his rival's father \u2014 he brought no open accusation of unfairness against them ; but he left damaging reports uncontradicted, reticence which told in favour of his forbearance, and impressed the general mind with a stronger belief in the Sutton's harshness \u2014 a belief shared by the Ewells. Even Mary's faith in her friends was somewhat staggered by the culminating tragedy and Aaron's pompous funeral display, and had they left the influence to work there is no knowing what time might have accomplished. Instead, with a very sincere desire for their sister's ultimate happiness, and very little insight into Aaron's character, the mother and her sons did their best to wean and isolate Mary from her younger lover. She had a tender and pitiftd heart, and they made the most of Granny Fagg's sufferings at the hands of the oppressors, and when she wept for the old woman thought their purpose was achieved. But she was steadfast as she was tender, and no argument would convince her that Jack had any share in the wrong laid to his charge. Nor would any coercion induce her to give him up. So at Orpha's suggestion she was once more placed under strict super vision. All meetings with Jack Sutton were prohibited ; one brother or other bore her company to or from church, Orpha did all her own shoppmg, and Aaron Fagg spent most of his evenings on their hearth. Thus she was virtually a prisoner to that narrow street, and they, because she made no noisy resistance, considered that she had seen her error in time. They did not think how much quiet force lay under her seeming composure, or how often she re called Jack's suggestion that she would be twenty-one and her own mistress ere long. And there were times when vigilance slackened, and she contrived to spend a few breathless moments with Jack, moments in which the bliss of meeting was dashed with the bitterness of parting, and the pain of secrecy. In spite of popular opinion James Sutton lost no time in clearing the ruins of Granny Fagg's house from the face of the land. A new and much larger foundation was dug out and laid down ; but the brickwork had barely reached the level when light frosts began to set in, and Jack thought it would be wise to cease building for a time. But James Sutton, ordmarily so cautious,"], [204, "192 THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. ignored the frost, because it was slight, and was gone in the morning when he was up and about. Then it came with a strong pinch, and with many a muttered anathema, he gave orders to stop further bricklaying. It was a hard winter, and if a thaw set in, and rain fell for a few days, frost was sure to show its face again ; and as certain was James Sutton to be seen with his hands in his pockets amongst piles of bricks and sand, and looking as ruefully at the unpromising aspect of incomplete walls as though his own wedding, and not that of his son, depended on it. People laughed at him, and said, \" Most haste, least speed ; \" but he only became inwardly more impatient to have his house built, and prove how little he was affected by the opinions of others. One thing did annoy him. When the walls were in their earliest stage he more than once encountered Aaron Fagg, with a pail in his hand, close to the spot, and whether his conscience pricked him, or he thought the man's presence boded evil, his confident, self-satisfied look faded from his face, and the closed lips grew stern. Did Aaron haunt the spot to revive that ridiculous allusion to Naboth's vineyard which Jack had the temerity to repeat ? Or did he think to arrest the progress of the work with his sinister presence ? If he wanted to have a lesson in house-building he was welcome \u2014 he should see a specimen of workmanship that would last for ever ! And so the tenor of his thoughts ran as he viewed, well pleased, the walls and joists, as story rose above story, until rafters were covered with slate, floors laid down, windows glazed, locks fitted, painters and paperhangers busy with paint and brushes, and, as he said, only a few days' spring sunshine were wanted to dry the whole thoroughly. At last even the painters carried away their cans, and an April sun shone on a goodly red brick house, embellished with stone, having two bay windows in the front, and an ornamental balcony above each. It appeared a house to stand for centuries, a credit to architect and builder both, so perfect were its arrangements both without and within. The rearing supper had been given long before, but the well satisfied builder had promised a like treat to painters and decorators with most unwonted generosity. \" And now, Jack,\" said he, as he ran his eyes critically over the moiddings and wall-paper in the drawing-room, playing the old tune on the contents of his pockets, \" the house is ready for occupation in spite of the croakers. I shall bring your mother to look over it in the mormng. The new furniture is all"], [205, "THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. 193 ready to come in. So now, my lad, if Mary be willing, you can be married as soon as you like, and leave Aaron Fagg in the lurch.\" Jack, with unaccountable impatience (he never entered the building with any comfort), had gone downstairs, leaving Ms father to follow, and only portions of the speech reached his ears as he passed out through the open front door. Still speaking, James Sutton lingered in an upper doorway, to take a last admiring survey, as the warm sun shone brightly in through the broad window. \" Well, I think I've shown the croakers what a man can do when he has made up his mind. I wonder what Granny Fagg would think of my house if she could see it ? What a change from her rotten old shed ! Firm, com pact, solid.\" All the doors stood open to dry the paint. A sudden gust of wind sweeping through the passage closed the back door with a bang, just as he stamped Ms foot on the floor, as if to prove his words. \" There's not a builder in all Kent could put up a house stronger or better than \" The last word was unspoken. With no more warning or premonition than the shock of the closing door, the walls collapsed, the floor rent and sank beneath his feet, and he was borne down into darkness and oblivion. James Sutton's house was down with a crash ! What saw the rushing crowd of alarmed spectators but a cloud of dust, and a heap of ruins, where had stood a sightly edifice five minutes before ! \" Granny Fagg's curse,\" ran in a whisper through the rapidly increasing crowd, with a strange thrill. SuddeMy a boy, who had thrust Mmself forward recMess of danger, peering inquisitively with outstretched neck, raised an affrighted cry. \" Why, there's Jack Sutton under all that rubbish ! \" Ay, surely there, almost on the very threshold, lay Jack, as he had been pitched forward, and above his outstretched body lay a mass of brick and splintered wood, which had been so lately the ornamental doorway. Well for him he had stood no nearer to the entrance, or, quick as were willing and strong hands to release him, help might have come too late. As it was, the crushed posts and lintels crossed, as it w*ere, and formed a resisting-bar to the pressure above. Still there was a heavy weight upon his lower limbs, requiring both strength and skill to remove. The first token of life was a groan when his right leg was released, and then a surgeon, who had made his way through the o"], [206, "194 THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. crowd, and held an almost pulseless wrist, appeared better satisfied. Just then two bonnetless women came rushing up, for whom the crowd made way \u2014 Mrs. Sutton, frantic in her grief, and Mary Ewell, the embodiment of pale despair. \" Thank God, he lives ! \" was the sole exclamation of the latter, as she stood there with white lips and clasped hands, not venturing to impede the progress of the workers ; but Mrs. Sutton would have thrown herself sMieMng upon the body of her son, had not the strong grasp of Stephen Ewell (who had followed close on their heels) restramed her. With a gentleness hardly to be expected from the rough boat man, he drew the mother aside, and made her comprehend that her son's life might depend on her discretion ; and then he and Samuel, under the guidance of the doctor, helped to turn and remove the bruised sufferer, who had lain on his face. They would have borne him at once to the infirmary, but the agonised mother insisted on having him carried home. Nobody should nurse her Jack but herself. Her \" husband had money enough to pay for doctors ! \" But with the word \"husband\" came a suggestion. Where was he ? And again she wrung her hands and shrieked aloud in agonised inquiry. Alas ! days elapsed before James Sutton's remains were recovered from the debris in which he was embedded. He had indeed built for himself a house to endure for ever \u2014 a narrow tenement for which, it is to be feared, he was little prepared. There was, of course, an inquest,with the customary formalities, and experienced followers of his own craft agreed in pronouncing the accident the result of building the lower courses during winter, when there were frosts about. The setting of the mortar was fictitious ; the first real sunshine had thawed it, and the weight of the superstructure brought the whole to the ground. There was, however, a dissentmg voice. The bricklayer's foreman, anxious to exculpate himself and his dead employer, averred that sea water had been secretly mingled with the lime as it lay slacked for mortar, and that an enemy had done this. At once suspicion pointed with ready finger to Aaron Fagg, and more than one witness came forward to prove that he had been seen carrying pails of water up from the shore and past the building about the time of the workmen's breakfast hour. To refute this Aaron affirmed that he had for a long period supplied a poor woman with sea water to bathe a rickety child, and done it out of pure charity ; that the man he employed to"], [207, "THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. 195 take it was temporarily engaged elsewhere, and that, rather than disappoint the poor mother, he had carried it himself for a week or more. The woman came into court bringing the child with her, and was very indignant that so good a man should be falsely accused. Her testimony turned the scale. A verdict in accordance with the practical builder's evidence was returned, and Aaron Fagg walked out of court a free man. Free \u2014 inasmuch as he was unshackled by the law. But from that horn* he carried an ill odour about with him. Something that could hardly be called suspicion followed him, and rumour passed from eye to eye, without the need of tongues ; and, justly or unjustly, even the Ewells lost their old faith in him, and ceased to press him on their sister. She, poor girl ! lest home the night of the catastrophe, and never returned to dwell there. She took her place in the house where lay her lover, with limbs crushed and broken, and a widowed mother who refused consolation. She was at once nurse and comforter \u2014 \" like an angel in the house,\" said Mrs. Sutton ; and her son echoed the words. Hers was a double ministration \u2014 she brought the consolations of religion to bear upon affliction, and made a blessing of calamity in the end. The summer went by, and autumn came agam to flush the skies and ripen the harvests before Jack Sutton rose from his sick couch, and then he was another sort of man \u2014 soul and body. Doctors had shaken their heads over his crushed foot and broken tioigh, and talked of amputation ; but the tearful pleading of Mary, and the declaration of his mother that she would spend every penny she had rather than see her son a cripple, put the surgeons on their mettle ; scientific sMU was stimulated, and in the end, when his crutches were discarded, he walked about once more on his own limbs. True he had lost a finger, and had a scar close to his temple, but Ms hair grew long and covered the seam, and the finger was the fourth on the left hand, and they were thankful in their inmost hearts that it was no worse. Seven hundred pounds of Ms father's savings had gone with brick and mortar to the ground ; wMlst undertakers and doctors had carried off more than another hundred between them ; but there was still something left to start the world with ; his father's busmess had not gone wholly to the dogs, and on all sides there was a demand for building. By the time he was able to take his place as master in his father's vacated office, Mary had tM'own aside her mourning and"], [208, "196 THE HOUSE JAMES SUTTON BUILT FOR HIMSELF. blossomed as a bride, and that, too, under the auspices of her brothers. Some ugly facts had come to light respecting their brother-m law, Aaron Fagg ; and though Jack Sutton generously repudiated all belief in the salt-water theory, and blamed offly the frost and his father's unwise haste for the destruction of his property, these facts were not to be disproved. Nay, their close connection with Aaron had almost brought the Ewells into jeopardy, when the coastguard, who had for some had their eyes on Mr. Fagg's grandmother, turned their attention to the sailmaker's shed, and the house in the narrow street, and found that he had a penchant for French lace, gloves, and other commodities which had not \"paid tribute unto C\u00e6sar.\" At all events he thought it wisest to beat a retreat, and when he was gone the woman who had come forward at the inquest with her child was gone too. The discovery that Aaron Fagg had been unworthy, no doubt, had much to do with the graciousness of the Ewells towards Jack, but his misfortunes had somewhat, and Ms open profession of Christiamty more. Only Orpha held aloof from the wedding feast and the young people, and she was not missed. In the old home, mother and daughter-in-law lived together in amity, little children clustered round, and there was laid the foundation of another structure, \" a mansion not built with hands, eternal in the heavens,\" though the house James Sutton had bmlt for himself was as narrow and dark as that of old Granny Fagg."], [209, "THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. CHAPTER I. Mrs. Morris was busy in her cool dairy, into which stole the slant rays of the afternoon sun, broken and tinged with emerald from the luxuriant creepers interposed between the lattice and his fiery glare. She had already filled an ample wicker basket with rolls of tempting yellow butter, in their summer robes of fresh green dock leaves, a damp muslin lying between each layer, and a fair cloth beneath to invest and cover all. She had another basket on the stone table before her, in which she was depositing a store of smooth white eggs, counting them carefully as she proceeded, with a shrewd guess at the amount they would bring at the morrow's market. Her catenations were interrupted by a pleasant voice from a pair of full red lips, which, somehow, taken in conjunction with blooming cheeks, clustering curls, and deep hazel eyes, were strongly suggestive of ripe fruitage in garden or orchard \u2014 at least so thought a certain Edwin Blake, a young Birmingham tradesman, who was about to gather and garner the whole in his private storehouse, for his own especial delectation. A light free step and a supple form came with the voice from the doorway. \" Mother, you might as well give me this quilted petticoat ; you will never wear it ; and it would suit me exactly.\" Mrs. Morris must have lost her temper, as well as the count of her eggs, she turned round so sharply. \" Just you take that petticoat back where you got it from. What were you doing in my linen-press, I should like to know ? \" \" Why, mother, didnt you say I might have three pair of homespun sheets, and a couple of your grass-bleached tablecloths, towards our housekeeping ? I went to the press to look them out, and found the petticoat lying there,\" answered pretty Patty, with some surprise. \" I tMnk you might have waited till I came to look them out for you. You know I don't like my things tumbled over by meddlesome fingers. Anyhow, you'd no call to that petticoat,"], [210, "198 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. and might ha' let it a-be,\" rejoined Mrs. Morris, with increased asperity. \" I didn't know there was any harm in looking at a petticoat ; and when I saw that you had not even got the band on, after all these years, I thought you might as well give it me for a wedding present as let it lie idle there. I shoMd wear it.\" \" Ah, I'll warrant you would. Work days or Sundays, wet or fine, would be all the same to you, even if it were lined with gold. In my time lasses were taught to be careful with their clothes, an' everything else ; now, it's ' best first and best always ' with all on 'em. No, I don't give a valuable skirt like that to be hacked on at every turn. Take it back at once. You've made me lose the count of the eggs,\" said the displeased dame, as with a flushed face she turned round to recount them. \" Well, I don't think I'm likely to wear a satin petticoat in common ; but if you think so, and would rather give it to the moths than to your only girl, and her going away for good, I'll take it back, and say no more about it.\" So saying, Patty retraced her steps to the lavender-scented press in which the careful housewife kept her abundant store of linen, the produce of home industry while spimiing-wheels had yet a place in farm-houses. Refolding the coveted garment, not without some Eve-like glances and longings, she replaced it on the shelf, consoling herself with the reflection that it was almost too thick and heavy for comfortable wear. Ah ! had she but known ! \" Mother needn't have been so sharp over it, even if it had been made of gold ; but it may lie there till it gets mouldy before I'll touch it again. Cotton and stuff have always had to serve my turn, and may do so still for all she cares. If it hadn't been for father I should hardly have had anything extra to fit me out for my wedding ; and he hasn't opened his hand too wide. Whatever must Edwin think of their stinginess ? How can father be so mean, and him having thousands of pounds in Bridgnorth Bank ? And what mother does with all her egg-and-butter money puzzles me. She never spends half of it in the house, I know.\" Patty reached her own fresh -looking room at this point of her cogitations. It was littered with clothes and other odds and ends. On an oaken bureau, covered with a napkin, lay a white silk drawn-bonnet and cambric dress for the wedding, with a satin sash, gloves, and other equipments ; but certainly neither shawl nor mantle befitting the occasion. A large painted box stood in the middle of the room, in which she had been packing her belongings. Kneeling down by its"], [211, "199 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. side, she resumed her occupation, and was adding her small dower of homespun linen when Mrs. Morris came in at the door behind her. Left to herself in the dairy, the thrifty dame had been troubled with compunctious visitings very detrimental to the correct enumeration of eggs. Patty had touched one of memory's chords, and it continued to vibrate. She remembered the goodly store of garments and household goods she had brought to her husband in that very farm, forty years before, and the goodly bag of gumeas put into her hand overnight, with the blessings of her father, who was nothing like so well-to-do as Patty's father. Then she speculated whether Edwin Blake's relations would be better dressed than her girl, and look down on her in consequence. And, though not of an emotional nature, the thought that Patty was going quite away, where they should seldom see or hear from her \u2014 for the Morrises had not the pens of ready writers \u2014 did stir the golden key of her heart a little bit, and she began to feel that she might have been a trifle more generous \u2014 as, indeed, she might. Covering up the eggs, she walked into the large house-place, where two bare-armed, apple-cheeked women were bustlmg about with gowns tucked up, busied in preparation for the wedding feast (stint in eatables or drinkables being unthought of), and opening a drawer in a polished-oak bureau, the dark wood of which contrasted well with the red quarries of the floor, turned over the contents with lingering and hesitating fingers. Selecting two articles, she hastened to Patty's room before her purpose had time to cool. \"Here, Pattv, lass, I've brought the shawl tha' wanted to wear on Thursday ; and as I reckon town folk dress finer than we farmers' wives, here's a new silk dress for thee ; tha' canst have it made up in town fashion, after thou'rt wed.\" Patty jumped to her feet gleefully, and straightway went into ecstasies. Flinging her arms around Mrs. Morris, she gave her a most expressive hug, and more than one delighted kiss. It was Patty's first silk dress, and the voluntary gift was a new experience. Whether the girl's exuberant thanks had opened her heart, or the new pleasure of giving was more delightful than she had anticipated, is hard to say ; but the gratified daughter was yet holding up the silk to admire its changing hues when the mother came again, this time with a fresh donation from the linen press. Patty opened her eyes in wonder, and if her thanks were more subdued they were sufficient."], [212, "200 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. Aster a brief absence and some jingling of keys, Mrs. Morris returned with a tiny box, contahhng a pair of old-fashioned ear-rings, and a brooch set round with pearls ; and before Patty's fresh ecstasies subsided, the newly-born liberality called forth a further outburst of thanks, with the offer of \"the spare white and-gold china tea-service.\" Patty's eyes sparkled with wonder and delight, enhanced, no doubt, by the rebuke she had received in the dairy. As her mother turned to go down stairs, she coMd not forbear saying, \" I hope, Patty, you're not hankering after that quilted petticoat of mine ? \" \" Hankering after that ! Not I. Why, that silk dress alone is worth the petticoat twice over.\" \" H \u2014 m ! I don't know that. But so long as you're pleased, I'm content ; \" and Mrs. Morris, in very good humour with herself, as if lightened of a load \u2014 the load of that quilted petticoat \u2014 lest Patty to her preparations. The close hand being once opened, found its way into drawers and closets and cupboards, and one by one odd things she coMd spare were brought to Patty, or handed over to her brother Bob, to be sent off by the carrier to Birmingham, along with her boxes. So when Edwin Blake, on the Thursday evemng, introduced his pretty wife to her new home m PershoreRoad, where his mother and sister waited to welcome and reassure the bride, she found a ham and a side of bacon, herbs, butter, jars of honey, preserves, pickles, home-made wines, apples, onions, and sundry little matters likely to prove useful in housekeeping. Moreover, her father, on parting from her, had put a twenty pound note into her hand ; and never having had so much money m her life before, and lookmg for nothing she was well pleased. Not so the bridegroom, who, though a very good fellow, fairly disinterested in his choice of a wife, had sufficient of humamty's leaven to expect that Peter Morris would accompany the gist of his daughter with one or two hundred of his hoarded guineas ; and when, aster the bridal ceremony, the farmer took him aside, and dilated on the sum Patty would \" come in for \" at his death, and expressed his hopes for the prosperity of Edwin's business (which he showed no tendency to further), he did set Peter Morris down in his secret heart as a stingy old curmudgeon. He, however, said nothing of his disappointment to Patty, lest she should think him mercenary, and question the sincerity of his affection ; but kissmg her warmly ere he started for busmess the next morning, left her smging merrily as she explored cupboards and closets for the disposition of her stores, a full"], [213, "201 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. believer in both parents' liberality. He saw that she was satisfied, and he was pleased that she should remain so. Besides, he had a notion, which time confirmed, that a girl so thriftily and industriously reared was a fortune in herself. Still, in spite of old proverbial philosophy, he thought himself hardly dealt with in not receiving a fortune with her also. He had opened a shop in New Street, as a woollen draper, some eight or ten months previously, with but a small capital, on which the furnishing of his house had made considerable inroads ; and he had hoped Patty's dower would have been sufficient, not only to cover that outlay, but to help in the extension of his business, which was certainly thriving, albeit he fancied himself crippled by the want of means to launch out as he had contemplated. This idea of \" launching out \" he had derived from a customer, a tailor named Rotton, a man of plausible tongue and insinuating countenance, set in a frame of crisp black hair, in strict accord with Ms Samsonian breadth of shoulders and muscular limbs, and in marked contrast to the slightly-built, light-haired, dapper young shopkeeper. This tailor had contrived, in course of time, whilst purchasing cloth or trimmings, to carry conversation beyond the limits of their dealmgs, until they became so friendly that an invitation to the dainty little home in Pershore Road came as a matter of course. \"Well, Patty, what do you think of Mr. Rotton?\" asked Edwm, after their guest had gone, and they sat, as was their wont, in close embrace by the waning fire, for an hour's connubial confidence. \" I don't like him ; and that's the truth. A taint of stale tobacco came in with him ; and though he drank my tea, and munched my tea-cakes \u2014 praising both immoderately, as if no one ever brewed good tea or baked a cake before \u2014 I firmly believe that a glass of ale and a long Broseley pipe would have been more to his liking. I hope you won't invite him again.\" But Thomas Rotton needed no second invitation \u2014 he \" dropped in \" unasked from time to time, with a very happy knack for so doing when Miss Blake was staying there ; and though Patty liked him none the better for that, she felt herself constrained to be hospitable to him as one of Edwin's best customers. Even when he volunteered to stand sponsor for their baby-girl Susie \u2014 Laura Blake being a god-mother \u2014 she barely resigned herself, on Edwin's entreaty, to what she regarded as a disagreeable infliction, since, notwithstanding his endeavours to wm her favour, she had a perception that as Ms influence over Edwin culminated her own waned."], [214, "202 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. But it was over the counter in New Street that Thomas Rotton carried out his plans and schemes, so that but two weeks aster the christening feast Edwin electrified his wife when he said, \" I'm going to add tailoring to my business, Patty.\" She put down the breakfast cup she was raising to her lips, and with wide open eyes echoed his one word, \" Tailoring ? \" in a tone of most absolute questioning wonder. \" Yes ; the profits are enormous, and no premises could be better situated than mine,\" he replied, warming with sanguine anticipation as he spoke. \" But you are not a tailor ; and you would have to give credit ; and your capi \" He interrupted her, ignoring the drift of her remarks, \" Oh, that is not necessary, if I have a partner who is.\" Patty looked into her husband's eyes, with a new light in her own. \" A partner ! \" she repeated, with a slight catching of her breath. \"Hush, baby!\" she added parenthetically, as the unnoticed infant on her lap broke in on the conversation. \" Yes ; Thomas Rotton will join me, and do all the measuring and cutting-out. There is not a more skilful cutter in all Birmingham.\" \" In his own estimation, no doubt,\" was Patty's comment. \" Then he has a good connection.\" \" May-be.\" He ran on, heeding not these interruptions : \" It is true more capital would be needed ; but when he sees how we are prospering, no doubt your father would advance the trifle we should require \u2014 that is, on proper interest,\" he added, as he saw a shade of doubt cross her speaking face. \" Oh, I would not trust to that, Edwin ! Father is so close with his money. And how is he to know you are prospering, if you want to borrow ? \" For a moment the shade seemed transferred to Ms face. He hesitated, drew up his under-lip between his thumb and fore finger \u2014 his light eyebrows coming down over his eyes, which found new interest in the carpet. Patty pushed her advantage. \" But, above all, Edwm, I would not trust Thomas Rotton. If you take him into partner ship you will repent it, as sure as you sit there at this moment.\" \"Nonsense ! Why do you say that? He has as good an address, and is as sharp a man of business, as any in New Street; and what more would you have ? \" Patty was walking up and down the room to still her fractious"], [215, "203 THE QUTLTED PETTICOAT. baby. She stopped, turned round, looked her husband full in the face, and answered, \" Honesty ! \" Edwin rose, with more displeasure in his countenance than h i wife had yet beheld. \"Patty, what do you mean? What reason have you for casting a slur on such a general favourite ? I am glad Laura is not here. Did you ever hear any ill of him ? \" No ; she had not heard any evil of the man \u2014 had no reason, no explicable reason, for her mistrust, only a woman's quick instinct, which is alive and alert ere slow reason opens its drowsy eyes. Edwin Blake hurried off to business that morning angry with his wife, angry with himself, doubtful of the dark, broad-shouldered, smooth-tongued man, who brought his faultlessly-fitting garments into the woolleu draper's shop before he had well regamed his equanimity. He found the younger man less eager for the partnership than he had lest him overnight, and was not long in worming out that Mrs. Blake's counsels lay at the root of this newly-grown caution. \" Now, Blake, that's just the way with women. They are wet blankets, every one of them \u2014 tMow a damper on all enterprise, however promising. What do women know of business ? Let them mind their babies and their housekeeping, and leave commercial matters to men. No wise man trusts his wife with his business transactions. They are beyond her grasp.\" \"Ah, but my Patty is sMewd, and has a very clear head,\" expostulated the young husband. \"Possibly,\" assented the other, slightly elevating his eyebrows and shoMders, as he played idly with a yard-stick taken from the counter. \" I know she has clear eyes, and a pleasant face \u2014 is a capital cook, and makes most delectable tea-cakes ; but I put it to your common sense \u2014 Is a farmer's daughter likely to know anytMng of trade or its exigencies ? Still, if you, as a good husband, think a good wife necessarily a good tradeswoman to boot, we had better withdraw from our arrangement while the deed is unsigned. I have no wife myself, as yet \" \u2014 with an emphasis \u2014 \" and do not choose to be one of a firm with another man's wife as the controlling head.\" Thomas Rotton knew his man. Like most little fellows, Edwin Blake had a sufficient idea of his own common sense and his ability to direct his own affairs. And never was the wily tailor so keen about the projected partnership as when he proposed to throw it up."], [216, "204 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. Before that coquettish April month had smiled over its last shower, a re-painted sign announced \"Blake and Rotton\" as \" Tailors and Drapers.\" Before the hawthorns of May shed their perfumed snow on the narrow pathways of the Pershore-road garden, and on the bending heads of Thomas Rotton and Laura Blake, he had persuaded her that he was desperately in love. The two were affianced ; and the Blakes, mother and brother, rejoiced. Patty oMy shook her head in private \u2014 she did not rejoice. Before the year was out Edwin Blake began to have misgivings that he had acted precipitately. His father-in-law had declined to lend him the sum he required, telling him that he \" never sowed his corn on land he hadn't ploughed,\" and bidding Mm \"look before he leaped, or he might land in a ditch.\" That was precisely what Edwm had done. He had signed, sealed, and executed before ascertaimng that Rotton was absolutely m command of the cash he had agreed to invest. Orders flowed in, business increased, but capital was not forthcoming. At the new partner's suggestion bills were drawn and discounted, and for a time all went swimmingly. This was in New-street. In the pretty little box in Pershore-road matters were not quite so satisfactory, even on the surface. Business had from the first absorbed Edwin six days out of every seven ; but Sunday was by Divine right his own and Patty's, to be made the most of. Then the Norwich shawl, and silk dress, lustrous as neck of drake or peacock, came into requisition. There was morning church, a cosy tUe-a-tete dinner, perhaps an afternoon stroll, ending with a chatty tea at home, or with old Mrs. Blake and her daughter at Edgbaston \u2014 and all with Edwin by Patty's side, loving, cheerful, hopeful. Then, all the week, the midday meal having been little more than a fiction to both of them, the nice little week-day suppers spread out on the glossiest and whitest of tablecloths, with the appetising accompaniments of bright glass and cutlery, and a most eloquent grace of kisses. The undesirable presence of Mr. Rotton occasionally marred Patty's sense of exquisite enjoyment ; but in after-life she was wont to look back on that year of her married life as a blissful dream. Not that all was honey. No newly-married pair ever assimilated so wholly that no drop of bitter mmgled with the sweet. Satan came into this paradise in the guise of the new partner. His visits, never agreeable to Patty, now became more frequent and obtrusive. He would come home with Edwin to supper, break in on their Sunday calm, and make a cry from baby Susie"], [217, "THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. 205 a pretext for bearing him away for the rest of the evening \u2014 and all with so much suavity, Patty had no room for protest. After supper hours were no longer delightful with confidential com munion. His expanding business increased anxieties with which he had no mind to worry his wife, so he took refuge in Mr. Rotton's dictum, that \" the less a woman knew of her husband's affairs the better for both.\" To Patty this silence was ominous. Tracing this reticence back to the partnership, she essayed to weaken the influence of Thomas Rotton, and re-establish her own. Vainly. Edwin laughed away her fears, assured her that all was going well, that Laura saw no fault in Rotton, who was the cleverest and sharpest fellow he knew. \" Too clever by half, and you will find it so, to your cost, before long, or I am blmd.\" \" Patty, you really are a wet blanket. Rotton is right.\" \"Yes; Rotton is always right! You will find him wrong some day.\" The \" some day \" came sooner, and with another aspect, than even Patty had foreseen. CHAPTER H. They had been married three years. After many delays, Laura's marriage with Mr. Rotton was definitely fixed for the third of the next month \u2014 JMy. The bride-elect and her mother had been hastily summoned to Pershore-road. A baby-brother had come to little Susie overnight, and they were there to welcome the little stranger. Worn with anxiety, excitement, and late watching, Edwin far overslept himself. Contrary to his clock-work habits, he did not reach New-street until ten o'clock in the mornmg. As the keys had been in the hands of his partner for some time, his unpunctuality did not trouble him. He entered the street elate with his new happiness. He was the father of a livmg son ; and the darling mother was doing well. She was dear to him in spite of Thomas Rotton ! \" But\u2014 what ? The shutters not down ! The shop closed! \" The shopboy and one or two journeymen, lounging in the front or propping up the door posts, moved at his approach. \" Shop not open at ten o'clock ! \" he repeated in angry consternation. \" What is the meaning of this, Jim ? Where is Mr. Rotton?\""], [218, "206 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. \" Don't know, sir. Not seen Mm this morning,\" answered the shopboy promptly. \" Quick ! run to his lodgings ; see what is the matter, and if he be ill bring back the keys,\" cried Blake hurriedly. The boy was darting off. \" Stop, Jim ! \" He hailed a passing cab. \"Jump in, and lose no time.\" A word of direction to the driver, and Jim was whirled off towards Camp Hill, leaving Edwin pacing in front of his shop muttering impatiently to himself. Jim came back open-mouthed and empty-handed. \" Mr. Rotton's not there, sir. He's not been nigh his lodgings for three days. He said he was a-going in the country. An' he owes Mrs. Izon such a lot of rent ! \" Edwin was dumbfounded. Necessity for action roused him. What a sight of desolation met the eyes of the young tradesman when the strong lock was forced ! The shelves were bare as when he first entered the premises four years before. Measuring tape, patterns, loose buttons, lay about, but not a piece of broadcloth or waistcoating, silk, or lining was left for shears to cut or buttons to trim. The news of the robbery spread, and neighbours came flocking in to find Edwin Blake with his head buried in his arms on the counter utterly dismayed and prostrated. How proudly he had lest home two hours before ! And now ! Mr. Aston, a friendly neighbour, endeavoured to rouse him ; but the shock had been too great and sudden. \" It will kill my wife ! It will kill my darling ! It is ruin, ruin ! \" was the cry wrung from his spirit's agony. Sorry for incapacity born of distress, kind Mr. Aston took upon himself to dismiss the gaping crowd, close the door, and send for the police. Investigation elicited that the officer on night duty had observed Mr. Rotton and another man coming backwards and forwards, carrying away bales of cloth on their shoulders, in the direction of the Bull Rmg, after other shops were closed, and until midnight. That the man himself thought it \" a queer start.\" but Mr. Rotton's voluntary iMormation that they were \" removing to a fresh place of business in Digbeth,\" prevented his interference, if it did not altogether satisfy Mm. He \" knew the gent to be a partner in the firm, having, of course, a right to do as he liked with his own.\" The earth might have opened and swallowed them for all Edwin Blake saw of his partner or his goods ever aster. Common sense would have kept the ill-news out of the young mother's chamber ; but an impromptu courier, unaware of her"], [219, "THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. 207 \u25a0condition, sped with mischiefs fleetest foot to Pershore-road, gave a startling ran-tan at the knocker, and blurted out to the \" little marchioness,\" \" There's been a burglary at your master's shop. Mr. Rotton's stripped the place and run off ! \" Throwing up her hands with a cry, the servant girl darted up the staircase, leaving the evil trumpeter at the door, and had repeated the ill-tidings before old Mrs. Blake (who had a basin of gruel in her hands) could interpose or check her. The disastrous consequences may be imagined. Edwin Blake was brought home that night by Mr. Aston, a ruined man, to find the wife he loved on the verge of brain fever, his dear old mother weeping silently by the bedside, almost too ill to keep her place in the sick room ; and his sister, a high spirited woman, pacing the parlour, with fiery eyes, and lips compressed to keep her bunting sense of shame, degradation, and indignation down. What of Patty's previsions now ? How Edwin's conscience smote him for his scorn of her clearer instinct ! Mr. Aston had been afraid to leave him to himself, he was alternately so excited and desponding. Patty's critical state roused all the man within him ; was the pivot on which turned his future. The greater anxiety absorbed the lesser. His energies were roused ; his activities set in motion. In the very listlessness of despair he had let his friend act for him during the harassing day. Now it was himself who rushed from street to street m quest of doctors and nurses. Patty had, however, no better or more tireless watcher than her distracted husband. \"My stupidity brought her to this pass, and we must manage (with God's blessing) to pull her tMough \u2014 or I shall have killed her,\" was Ms remark to his mother. And, after a very protracted struggle, she was \"pulled tMough,\" to his mfinite relief. But to what a miserable experience was she restored. It was pitiful to see her sad eyes wander round the prettj nest she had helped to line so daintily, only to become the prey of the spoiler. Pitiful to watch the covert glances that strayed from Edwin to Susie and baby, and the tight clasp she held of their Uttle fingers, as if she feared they too might be taken from her. The crisis in their affairs had come. The arm of the law, however long, could not grip a delinquent who had vanished out of sight and reach. Blake, however, was visible and tangible ; and one man, Avery, ostensibly a dealer m"], [220, "208 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. tailors' trimmings, covertly a bill discounter, and a crony of Thomas Rotton's, took care more lenient creditors should not ignore that tangibility. Besides sweeping off their stock, Rotton had surreptitiously collected the bulk of the book-debts, accounting for none. Consequently the assets were nil. Nothing remained but Edwin's household effects, and Avery put a man in possession of these on the first wmd of the disaster. He was a thorn in Edwin's side for years. At the first meeting of creditors he showed cruel animus, though his pickings out of the firm had been considerable. He insisted that the robbery was \" a plant to chisel the creditors,\" and that Blake had a hand in it. But when it was proved that Rotton had also fraudulently obtained from old Mrs. Blake a large sum to be invested in a mythic company, the tide of sympathy ran in favour of the swindler's victims \u2014 Laura's wrongs and Patty's sufferings not being overlooked. Avery had suggested that Mrs. Edwin Blake's relations were rich, and ought to come forward to pay their debts ; and his very opposition suggested to Patty a temporary haven of refuge whence help might possibly be forthcoming. Such personal belongings as the creditors spared to them were committed to old Mrs. Blake's charge at Edgbaston, along with Susie, who clapped her fatJittle hands at the change, and rejoiced m prospective petting ; unconscious of the deep wound in her mother's heart when she thus surrendered her child for an indefinite time. Mr. Aston voluntarily and liberally advanced the funds for their journey, without any thought for repayment ; and on the following Saturday Edwm and Patty were set down by the Shrewsbury coach m the Bridgnorth market-place, on their way to the home whence he had brought her little more than three years before a hopeful, happy bride, to new friends and a new home. That new home had been ravaged. They came back almost as fugitives, certaiMy as suppliants, and remembering the Morris proclivity to close the valves of the heart with a bank-book, neither husband nor wife felt the prospect cheerftd. Patty's hope was in her baby. \" His little waxen fingers must open both their hearts and their pockets ; no grandfather could resist them, and his namesake too,\" she fondly said. To their surprise, though it was market-day, there were no signs of the Morrises, either at the Swan or in the market. Inquiries, whether at the inn or from the country folk, only"], [221, "209 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. provoked broad grins, unintelligible hints about saints, and suppositions that \" happen they might be in time \" to find Peter Morris at Oak Farm ; all of wMch perplexed the young pair with vague fears. A farmer journeying homewards gave them seats in his light cart, putting them and their carpet-bag down at the end of a short lane leading to Oak Farm. As Patty entered the familiar gate she was struck by a strange undefinable change in the aspect of her old home. It was as though all customary operations had been suspended. Not a bleat, a low, or a cackle greeted her ear ; and though cattle and poultry were sure to be housed, for twdight was deepemng, long experience had taught her that sheep and cows, pigs and poMtry, were not unanimous in dropping qmetly asleep mstanter, any more than human beings. Then, as they went round the house (not profanmg the presumed sanctity of newly-cleaned front steps), she missed from the barMess dairy -tree its ordmary blossom of bright milk-cans. But indoors ! A tornado could scarcely have caused greater disorder and confusion than that which greeted Patty's wondering eyes ; nor would a tornado have created much more surprise than their advent at that juncture, m that topsy-turvy farm-house, where boxes and pacMng-cases seemed to elbow neglected furni ture out of the way. They were welcome, that was one good thing. \" Welcome as butter in the churn,\" according to Mrs. Morris, whose bare arms expanded to hug her weary-loolting daughter, and caress the \" sweet little poppet,\" opemng its big blue eyes at the big red face which seemed ready to smother Mm \u2014 with kisses. \" Well, lass, this is lucky ! Thee an' thy master have come just i' th' nick of time. It's quite a godsend like ! \" cried her father, smiting Edwin on the shoulder with one brown palm, and drawmg Patty to his embrace with the other. \" Ah ! you may well look round. I shoMd ha' written to tell thee, but somehow something or other always came to put it out of my head \u2014 and Bob there would rayther plough a dozen acre than write a letter. Somehow a flail or a plough comes readier to one's hand than a pen.\" What was there to tell ? Mormon missionaries had been sowing the Shropshire farmlands with other grain than wheat and oats, and were reapmg a goodly harvest, and a golden one. Peter Morris and Bob were going with a band of brother saints, like a swarm of bees, to carry fresh honey from English gardens to Joe Smith's overgrown hive in Utah. And, rather than be p"], [222, "210 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. separated from husband and son, Martha Morris was reluctantly going with them, even though her dread of the sea equalled her horror of polygamy. \" Saints, indeed ! They're no better than Turks. And I know I shall be drownded, I know I shall, before I get there.\" Yet this knowledge did not prevent her makmg ample provision for her private comfort on landmg at her destination, or taMng with her stores she was sure \" Ameriky \" could not supply. And so busy was she with her preparations \u2014 mdeed, so engrossed were they all with their own affairs, that they never once thought of askmg what unwonted circumstance had drawn the young couple thither. During the temporary lull of Sunday, it did occur to Peter that \"Brummagem air didn't seem to agree with his lass ; the smoke had taken all the colour out of her cheek, and made her white as a turnip.\" \" Turnip, indeed !\" echoed the mother. \" She's white as curds, an' as thin as a lath ; but we'll plump her up a bit while she's here, though all th' cows are gone but Bess, an' we've only a hen or two left to serve our own turn.\" Patty's recent illness was pleaded as a reason for pallor, but of the hidden heart-sickness neither she nor Edwin could muster courage to speak \u2014 even with such an opportunity \u2014 to people who took prosperity for granted, never even asked how he could be spared from his business, scarcely thought of distant Susie, and made but small account of the baby in the general bustle. Edwin helped less dexterous Bob with the packing, whilst Patty, not strong enough to do more, looked on, or rambled with her baby mto the fields and lanes to cry over it in secret, or strayed over the dismantled dwellmg, peering into closets and presses as if to print every detail in her memory. From the linen-press all the great store of damask and sheeting was gone ; but there lay, by itself, the very quilted petticoat her mother had refused to give her on her marriage. There it lay, just as it was \u2022 \u2014 no, not the same. The band was sewn on, but it had evidently never been worn. She laid baby down on the bed, and took up the petticoat to see how well it would have fitted her. \" What a weight it is ! I'm sure mother, stout as she is, will never be able to wear it ; and it looks as if she intended. Perhaps she means to show off among those Mormons. Well, I'll put it by. My quilted satin petticoat days are over for one while,\" ran the course of her thoughts, with a heavy sigh as a refrain. It was not until the last heavy box (one partly filled with small"], [223, "THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. 211 bags, which Edwin took to be seed-corn or pulse) was corded and labelled, consigned for transmission to Liverpool, and the remaining effects were being lotted for auction, that Edwin, growing desperate, broke the ice, and told the farmer how he had been swindled, asking his help to pay a small dividend and make a fresh start. They had been collecting into a large empty barn all the miscellaneous farm implements and appliances, and stood amidst a medley of pitcMorks, pails, hay-rakes, flails, sieves, sacks, hencoops, mash-tubs, cart-sheets, scythes, etc., already grouped for the coming sale. Peter was crossing the floor with a pile of harness when Edwin accosted him, and at the first did not take in the full import of his son-in-law's story. When light did dawn on the Mormonite understanding, down dropped the harness with a thud and a clatter, which, nevertheless, did not drown a tremendous oath from the \" saint's \" lips. \" Robbed ! Swindled ! ! Ruined ! ! ! Beggared ! ! ! ! \" he cried, his voice rising with every fresh exclamation. \" Our Patty without a home !\" and Ms lips quivered as much with rage as emotion. \" I am sure, Mr. Morris, you must see it has been my misfor tune, not my fau \u2014 \" urged Edwin, taken aback. \" Not your fault ! Didn't I warn you when you came to borrow money of me ? I saw through the millstone then. If men sow vetches they mustn't expect to gather peas. And now you want to borrow from me again.\" \" Well\u2014 yes\u2014 I \" \" Then you should ha' spoken out at first, instead of shilly shallying ! H I'd been ever so willing to throw good money aster bad, you've not left one a chance. All the brass I had was m the green box you corded yourself, and helped to lift in th' carrier's cart, yesterday.\" \" What ! You don't mean to say those were bags of money ! \u2014 and sent off with no better safeguard than a cord ! \" gasped Edwin, with a start and a groan for his own procrastination. \" I thought they were seeds.\" \"Aye, golden seeds,\" chuckled Morris, oblivious of the pam he inflicted on his unfortunate son-in-law. \" Good golden sovereigns as ever passed tMough Bridgnorth Bank.\" He was not, however, so much hard-hearted as tight-fisted ; and the expression on Edwin's face roused Ms better self. \" What's to be done for our lass, an' thee, an' th' little ones, now, passes me, unless . Here, come an' see what Martha thinks about it all.\""], [224, "212 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. By that law of duality which seems to influence the worlds- Patty had been led to open her heart to her mother at the very time her husband blundered through his story in the barn. They were found together in the best bedroom, the old woman with her apron over her head, seated on a corded hair trunk, and swaying her fat body to and fro ; Patty thrown sobbing against the bed with her face buried in the clothes, and baby Peter lying complacently on the quilted satin petticoat on the top of the bed, unsuspicious of the trouble around, or the rich garment crushed beneath Mm ; that garment which held fortune or fate in its folds, as motherhood or mammon should prevail. Not much acumen was needed to interpret that chamber scene ; so when Peter the elder entered, with Edwin in his rear, he blurted out without preparation \u2014 \"Well, Martha, our Patty's brought her pigs to a pretty market ! What dost thou think about it ? \" \" Think ! \" retorted Mrs. Morris, throwing down her apron, and revealing a tear-mottled face, \" Think ! Why, that if thou hadn't been in such a hurry to send thy pigs to a much worse market, neither thy own child, nor thy helpless little grand children, need have been without a home, as they will be next week ! \" The Latter-Day Saint had not expected this smart rap on the knucMes. \" Well, Martha, that's neither here nor there. Ned seems to have got into a nice mess, and what's to be done for them now puzzles me.\" \"I suppose thy Mormon friends wouldn't expect thee to give them all thy gettings, and let thy own flesh and blood starve ? \" the old woman jerked out impatiently. Peter's disclaimer was quite as ready, but he added, \" Couldn't they just as well go along with us ? Ned needn't carry his debts to the Salt Lake ; and the Elders would be glad to hail a fresh brother and sister.\" Mrs. Morris brightened at the mere proposition, but neither Edwin nor Patty fell in with a scheme so subversive of all they held sacred ; and to go off at this juncture would be mdeed to leave his character at the mercy of Avery. He should be branded as the accomplice of a common thief. No ! he must face his lot. But money to set him afloat again was not forthcoming. Not even when Peter Morris had the proceeds of the sale in hand. There had been so many sales under like circumstances so very recently, that buyers were few, and the meagre result of the sale put the old man mto a very ill-humour ; the worst possible for"], [225, "THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. 213 lendmg money. Yet he opened his heart so far as to offer, if the young people would go with them to Liverpool and see them on board the Atalanta, he woMd uncord the box and let them have a hundred pounds. He said he did not want to leave Ms girl destitute. Bob had been ordered to withdraw from the sale sundry useful matters m the way of stores and furniture, to help them in a fresh start ; but Mr. Bob was tainted with the family leaven, and, regardmg himself as lawful heir to his father's possessions, did not make too ample a selection. Patty's grief at losing her parents was not without a sostenmg influence. The old dame drew her into her room before starting for Liverpool, and, lockmg the doors, unsheathed the scissors she carried in her pocket, cut a few quiltmg stitches m the heavy satin petticoat, which she was putting on for the first time, and, tMough a concealed slit in the linmg, drew thence ten sovereigns one by one. These she gave to her wondering daughter, with the apologetic explanation, \"You see, Patty, your father was always so close with his cash, and Bob was as like his father as two peas, so I took to saving up my egg-and-butter money, and this was where I kept it. I'd not have had it long if Peter had found it, an' he were as keen as a ferret after gold. An' as one never knows what may happen, it's always best to be on the sure side. And now, who knows but I may need it all to get away from them Mormons afore I've done with them, if we don't get drownded before we get there.\" And that was the extent of the mother's generosity. She wore a petticoat lmed with gold, and salved her conscience with a parting gift of ten pounds to her homeless cMld. Mean m all thmgs demandmg an outlay of coin, the farmer, who could Mconsiderately consign thousands of pounds to a carrier with no better protection than an old rope, coMd not bring his mind to pay for ordinary comforts on board ship. He had taken steerage berths ! By the time they arrived in Liverpool Peter Morris evidently repented his promise. On one pretence or another he delayed \u25a0opening the green box until the luggage was stowed away m the hold, and was no longer attainable. Then the disconsolate looks of the disappointed husband and wife made him rather ashamed of his mggardliness. At the very last moment, when they were clearing the deck, he took a well-fflled canvas bag from his pocket, and, with a sort of lingering regret, and as much nervousness as if it were tMice the sum, told out ten pounds mto Edwin's palm as an instalment,"], [226, "214 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. with an assurance that he would be as good as his word, and send the remaining ninety as soon as ever he landed. He also pressed a couple of sovereigns into Patty's hand, and one into little Peter's mmiature fist, and there Ms liberality ended. Their niggardliness helped to soften the parting to Patty. Gold was more to them than consangumity or affection, and she felt it. As for Edwin, he was absolutely furious ; and, in his bitterness, expressed a wish that he had known what he w*as packing. \"I should have thought it no sin to help myself. I had a better right to it than those Mormonite humbugs ! And Patty, as the tram bore them back to Birmingham, lost herself in wondering if she could possibly ever grow so stingy as to dribble out ten pounds to her Susie if the child should come to want, whilst she waddled about in a petticoat lined with gold. Then she bewildered herself with calculations, how many tens of sovereigns were hidden m those diamond quiltings, and how long their twenty pounds woMd last. Poverty, indeed, came upon them like an armed man. Perse cuted by Avery, Edwm could not make head agamst it. He was arrested, sent to Coventry gaol ; but, bemg there, by the advice of Mr. Aston, who proved a true friend, he cleared himself of all his liabilities, and came out a free man. Shortly after, the bill discounter was himself caught tripping ; was glad to escape to California ; and Edwin seemed to feel the atmosphere clearer after he was gone. But for Patty, during his imprisonment, there was no haven. She was too independent to trespass upon Mrs. Blake, whose limited income had been still further curtailed by Rotton's treachery ; and she did not care for frequent contact with Laura, whose proud spirit chafed and fretted in silence at the degradation of her engagement to that swindling scoundrel. She took a small room for herself and children in one of those back squares so plentiful in Birmingham ; she who had been nurtured in country air. She learned waistcoat -making, and plied a rapid needle early and late. Her privations were never told, but they were severe ; and often when she parted with a necessary garment to procure a meal, or Susie cried for \"more,\" she thought of the sovereigns stitched up useless in her mother's petticoat with a bitterness that could not bring a blessing on the gold. But she was a deft hand at her needle, and contrived to spare out of her earnings something for the poor fellow shut up in Coventry gaol. His release brought one more mouth to be filled.. He applied for one situation after another, but Avery's slanders"], [227, "215 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. barred his path. Patty taught him her trade ; he turned to with a will, and they contrived not only to keep the wolf from the door, but to take a better room, furnished with the things from Oak Farm. And still they worked on, pamfolly and steadily, together. As may be surmised, no ninety pounds ever came from Peter Morris. No : his gold was dearer to him than his daughter. Instead, came a characteristic letter from Bob, and that aster the lapse of more than two years from their emigration : \u2014 Salt Lake City, September, 1849. Dear Patty, \u2014 This comes, hoping you and brother Edwin and Susie and Peter are well, as it leaves me at present. You must excuse me not. writing often. I'd as lieve use a pitchfork as a pen. We got here all safe. We had a tidy passage, but very uncomfortable.- We'd have been mrre comfortable in the cabins, but father thought that cost too much. We found the green box your Ned corded all right. Now, I must tell you we lost mother just as we were steaming up the river to New Orleans.* You know, as we went steerage1 we had to wait on ourselves. Well, mother went on deck to let a little bucket down into the sea for some water, and somehow she overbalanced and fell overboard. One or two sailors jumped after her, but she never put her head above water again \u2014 not once. They said something in her clothes must have held her down ; and I think it was all a heavy quilted satin petticoat she wore and never took off night or day, though she gasped and panted with the heat, and could hardly bear her own weight. For my own part, I've cause to think there was something heavier than wadding in it. Father and me could never make out what she did with her egg-and- butter money. We never saw the colour of it, and I guess never shall now. Father did take on when she were drowned, but I think it were as much for the petticoat as for mothe'-. He had felt the shiners in it many a while, and thought they were safe. I told him it all cameos his going steerage, leaving mother to wait on us. Howsomever he's got three wires sealed to him now. I mean to look round a bit. He sends best love to you all, and hopes you are getting on in the world ; and he hopes that Susie and little Peter are alive. He will not forget them in his will. \u2014 So, no more from your affectionate brother, Bob Morris. They were steeped to the lips m poverty when this letter reached them, stitching for a living, with two children down with scarlatina at the time. \" Served the stingy old woman right ! \" cried Edwin, in a rage. \"If she had given you the petticoat, and money too, she might be alive now, and all of us thriving. Your father had plenty for all of them.\" (And this was all the moan son and son-m-law made for the drowned woman !) \" She must have had pretty near two hundred pounds quilted in it. No wonder she was drowned. Poor mother, it does seem like a judgment,\" murmured Patty. \" The very gold she was so sparing of, though we were in such trouble, just to be the cause of her death ! \" * The route at that time."], [228, "216 THE QUILTED PETTICOAT. The terrible privations the Blakes had endured were not Avith out their uses. At least, they learned the value of one good friend. Mr. Aston, who was a widower with one son, proposed to Laura and was accepted. At the same time, he offered to lend Edwin a helping hand, and a West-of-England cloth manufacturer came forward to stock him a shop m High Street. The pull upwards was a very slow one, but it was upwards ; yet he never agam thought of \"launching out,\" and he kept elear of bill discounters. Years passed, other children had been born to them, Edwin was out of debt, had a nice house in Bellbarn-road, where Patty agam prepared nice little suppers for Mm, and held confi dential chat afterwards. Another letter came from Bob. Peter Morris was dead ! \u2014 had been killed in a scrimmage at the lynchmg of two Californian roughs, named Rotton and Avery. Had left no will. Bob took all. More years checked off m time's ledger. Edwin's business was flourishing ; he was saving money, Susie, a fine young girl, was about to be married to Mr. Aston' s son. Another letter from Utah. Bob was dead. All the money not swallowed up by the Mormomte maw was legally transferred to Patty, who had, besides, more enduring riches in the love of her husband and children than ever her father had carried off in a corded box, or her mother withheld m that quilted petticoat ; riches not to be weighed agamst gold or jewels. Let us hope this wmdfall of Morris gold may not brmg a tamt of Morris gold-fever with it, to numb the heart, and chill the budding affections of their offspring."], [229, "THE INDIAN SCARF. CHAPTER I. I have m my possession a crystal necMace brought from India when Marqms Wellesley's brilliant and victorious campaign terminated in a glorious peace \u2014 a relic which never fails to conjure up a mysterious tragedy that startled Manchester in 1805, the particulars of which came to me with the necklace. It is scarcely necessary to remind my readers of the wonderful revolution our cotton manufacture has undergone during the present century, or that whirlmg macMnery now performs deftly and swiftly, withm the precincts of the factory, many processes formerly requiring manual labour, and then consigned to operatives who did their work in their own homes ; whilst others have been superseded altogether. Thus the blowmg and scutcMng machines have set aside the batting frame : but long after the incidents of my story were forgotten, lithe and sinewy girls and women, dressed in short sleeved bedgowns and closely-fitting wrapper brats,* plied their supple wands, with alternate beat, on the mass of cotton lying before them on the springy batting-frame. One of these batters \u2014 a woman named Ann Smith \u2014 occupied the front cellar of a house in Oak-street, Manchester, which served her for workshop, bedroom, \" kitchen, and parlour and all.\" At that time it was a more general practice than now for the occupiers of good private houses, and even shopkeepers, so to sub let their basements, many of which were held by artisans, who converted them into underground shops for the sale of their own wares. The whole range of buildmgs was dmgy enough when I saw it last ; and such, I suppose, is its aspect now : but when Ann Smith lived these were good red brick three-storey houses, with three or four wide steps to the hall door, the plain iron railing of wMch was continued along the area, and enclosed a steep flight of steps givmg access to the cellar. This railing was * Brat \u2014 A tight pinafore or apron."], [230, "218 THE INDIAN SCABF. strengthened by a curved iron bar, extendmg from its front upper line to the house wall, where it was firmly set in the brickwork. Ann (or Nan as she was usually called) was a widow, and worked for Lawrence Brooks, the cotton spinner, whose mill stood opposite, with its mam entrance in Foundry-lane ; and so cheerful was she, that where another would have moped or grumbled at her lonely and lowly lot, she sang between the intervals of work, and congratulated herself that her room was so nigh her work, and that she had plenty of it. Living so near, she had less distance to carry the cotton from the mill and back when cleansed ; and, moreover, the proximity of her cellar to the factory enabled her to eke out her small gams by taking charge of the baggin-pokes,* and supplying potatoes, milk, mugs and hot water for such as indulged in tea, to a number of the mill girls who lived farther away, and were glad to pay a small gratuity for the accommodation. Summer and winter Ann's shutters were open before the first bell rang from the factory, her fire was lit, her hearth swept, her bed in the far corner re-made and covered with a decent and well-washed patch-work quilt, and herself in a short woollen petticoat, dark-blue cotton bedgown, and white lmen mob cap, ready to take their wallets from the lasses, who ran hurriedly down the sharp steps with a hasty \" Good mornin', Nan,\" and the sleep scarcely washed out of their heavy eyes. Her door always stood open, not merely for then ready entrance, but for the exit of the dust and flue which whirled in eddies through the room at every swift stroke she gave the raw cotton on the frame beneath the window, and which filled every chink and cranny. Not a nice atmosphere, you would thmk, and no wonder that Nan's voice was husky either in speaking or singing, or that her face was colourless. But she was not over particular ; and had there then been sanitary commissioners to poke their noses in at her door, and ask with a sniff, \" How, my good woman, do you contrive to breathe in such a palpable cloud of permcious refuse ? \" she would most likely have replied, \" We mun a' live, an' poor folk can't be partic'lar. Aw tak thmgs as aw find 'em, an' thank God they're na worse.\" Whatever slanderers may say to the contrary, it does not always rain in Manchester ; and as the curtain of smoke hanging over the town was not impenetrable in those days, we need not be surprised if, in the month of May, a few stray sunbeams found their way down the area, shone in Ann Smith's face (as with * Bac/gin \u2014 The Lancashire operative's mid-day meal ; the poke the bag in. which it is carried."], [231, "THE INDIAN SCARF. 219 hearty goodwill she gave, first a bat with the right hand, and then a bat with the left, to the wMtey-brown mass before her), and lit up also the face of a painted clock on the wall beyond. \" Eh, dear me !

By this time she had fimshed her song, notwithstanding the many interruptive ejaculations, and reached from a shelf sundry wooden platters, wiping them one by one, with the exclamation, \" Eh ! how th' dust dun settle on everythm' ! \" Then she broke out in a fresh strain \u2014 Oh, cruel were th' payrents that sent my love to sea, An' cruel was the press-gang that tore my love from me, An' cruel was the ship \" But here the factory bell rang out, drownmg alike the feeble striking of the wheezy clock and the unmusical notes of the vocalist.

It's covered wi' a cloth to keep th' dust out.\" Ellen Clough having placed the large earthenware pitcher within reach, some of the girls helped themselves to potatoes from the saucepan on the bar, and filling up their bowls with the cool buttermilk, found seats on stools, or chairs, or the bedside, or where they could, and began their repast without more ado. Others brought cheese and jannockj from their wallets ; Sarah Duckworth had a rasher of bacon to frizzle ; and an Irish girl, for whom it was a fast-day, brought forth a red-herring. The fare was not sumptuous, neither was it too abundant, but the partakers were not dainty, and the meal was seasoned with appetite and good-humoured chat. Sarah Duckworth, sitting on the bright fender toasting her bacon, resumed her banter of Ann Smith, and mimicked, with a fidelity which set all the girls laughing, her peculiar manner and intonation in singing, Oh, 'cruel were the payrents, &c. Findmg her imitative talents appreciated, she proceeded to give another and more plaintive ballad, still more familiar to Mrs. Smith's friends \u2014 \" Far, far, at sea \" \u2014 not seeing that she inflicted pam, or careless so that she made a Mt. * Collerd \u2014 Grimed with soot. t Marlockin \u2014 Romping \u2014 A marlock is a game, or practical joke.

Sarah seemed disposed to resent this, but her mouth was full, and good-natured Ellen Clough forestalled her by reminding the latter that she had never told them how her son Jack had become a sailor, or what concern it was of Mary Jackson's. \" My lasses, it's too long an' sad a tale to tell the ins and outs on, but aw think aw may tell ye aw wur wedded when aw wor but a slip of lass, wi' no more sense i' my yead than a poll-parrot.

The girls did not fail to claim Ann Smith's promise when again seated about her, with their mugs of milk, or a watery apology for tea, in their hands, and brown bread or jannock. \" Well, as aw wur tellin' ye,\" she resumed, \" we came to *Warp \u2014 The threads which run the length of the cloth, ranged in order by persons called warpers, mostly females, and then wound in large coils and carried on the head.

Meary's sort. It's mich to me if thy love o' finery does na bring thee into trouble some o' these days,\" said Nan, with a rueful shake of the head. Sally resented this last remark, and with a sharp retort and a fling at the absent Mary, bounced up and lest the cellar ; neither herself nor those she left beMnd dreaming how darkly prophetic was that well-meant admonition of Ann Smith's. A love of conquest (and of the power which it implied) was deeply rooted m Sarah Duckworth's heart, and on that fruitful tree a love of finery was as firmly engrafted. Even at work she wore a string of glass or red sealing-wax beads round her throat, and a pair of large circMar ear-rings, and seldom failed to leave her wrapper apron with Nan, and adjust her shawl coquettishly before -walking up Ancoats Lane home in an evening. Thus, after Ann had told her simple life-story, the \" sight of fine thmgs \" lymg perdu in the widow's painted coffer made the oMy lasting impression. The words haunted her imagination ; and in her longings for a glimpse at this unsuspected treasure she forgot her irritation at Ann's rebuke. The followmg day she endeavoured to persuade Ann to open her box and let them have a peep at its contents ; but Ann was not willing to comply, seemg she coMd ill afford to waste her time. But, by dint of coaxmg and a feigned concern for the fate of Jack himself, she prevailed on the fond mother to display her treasures at the end of the week, when work was over and the room cleaned up \u2014 a process she was unusually ready to facilitate. The hoarded treasures were just such odds and ends as seafaring men gather m passing from land to land. A birch-bark basket worked with stained grasses, a calabash bottle, a pah of mocassins wrought with coloured beads, a box of brilliant flowers skilfully made of parrot-feathers, a couple of new bright silk handkerchiefs like that the mother had m wear, and a few lesser matters, completed the store, of no great value save in the eye of affection or the collector of curiosities. But in the untrained mind of Sally they were treasures indeed, and the sight of the flowers and handkerchiefs set her longing to possess them. She seemed loth to let them out of her hand ; threw a kerchief over her shoMders, and placed the flowers in her bright-coloured hair, to the great dread of the owner lest they should sustain injury ; and she stood before Ann's scrap of lookmg-glass to admire herself. * She relinqmshed these adornments and helped to replace them, with more than one sigh of regret, and went home pondering how best to wheedle Ann either to give or lend a flower and a \u00ab"], [238, "226 THE INDIAN SCARF. kerchief to wear at Whitsuntide, then approaching. With this end in view she grew remarkably gracious, vieing with Mary Jackson in assiduous attentions, and envying the latter the education which enabled her to read the Bible to unlettered Nan on Sunday evenings. She even invested a few pence with a chapman in Smithfield market in the purchase of fly-leaf ballads, which she mf erred to be sea songs from the rude cut of a ship, or a sailor holding a huge purse, imprinted above the verses, and thought to win the sensitive mother's heart thereby. The narration of her story, and the exhibition of her hidden treasures, were incidents that broke upon the monotony of Ann Smith's life \u2014 m which there was not too much variety \u2014 though they set her thinking more and more. Though but forty-four or five, the painful experience of her married life had confirmed her widowhood, and she resigned herself to a ceaseless round of daily labour, thanMul for peace, and freedom from cruel bondage. No one heard her complain, unless Mary might exchange regrets with her on the prolonged absence of their sailor, so very dearly loved by both. But towards the close of the month another incident occurred which set her in a strange flutter of surprise and delight. One of Pickford's waggons came lumbering up Oak Street, and stopped m front of the house, lessemng Ann's small modicum of light. The ill -paved streets were not crowded with vehicles in those days, and the stoppage of a carrier's cart at a private door was a circumstance to bring faces to all the windows within range ; and as Ann was not free from the curiosity with wMch her sex is accredited, she laid down her batting-rods and looked up. The carter and his mate, aster moving sundry hampers and small parcels, drew forth slowly a heavy sea-chest, the sight of which set her heart beating, and then knocked at the house-door. After a brief parley with the person who opened the door, during which Ann's pulse seemed to stop, the men lifted the box between them, and \u2014 yes \u2014 actually carried it down the steps, and into her cellar. Yes ! into Ann Smith's cellar, the inmate looking on in a sort of dazed stupor, scarcely daring to believe her own eyesight ; not knowing whether to be glad or sorry. It was her son's kit, sure enough ; but what did its coming bode ? She had had no letter ; but then Jack was no great scholar. Was he alive and well, and coming home ? Or \u2014 how her heart sank, and her lips paled \u2014 had the ship-owners sent her dead boy's belongings to her as his survivor ?"], [239, "THE INDIAN SCARF. 227 The bare supposition unnerved her. She sank on a chair, and sat lookmg at the chest fearfully, yet greedily, long after the carriers had gone away. The coming in of the factory girls for their afternoon meal roused her. She was behmd time with her simple preparations ; but the cause was so apparent, she had few grumblers and many helpers. Ascertaimng the cause of Ann's agitation, Sally Duckworth suggested that the box shoMd be uncorded, to set doubt at rest, and her fingers were foremost in efforts to release the mvolved knots. The chest was locked, but the key was found nailed down under the label ; and \u2014 glad sight for the mother's eye \u2014 a letter lay inside at the top of everythmg ! In a transport of joy she seized it; but alas ! it was a dead letter to her. She coMd not read ! Cutting round the clumsy red seal with trembling fingers and the scissors suspended (m company with a college-pincushion*) from her waist, as if even the wax was somethmg precious, she opened the large sheet, and on Ellen Clough's assurance that it began \" Dear and honoured Mother,\" with a fervent \" Thank God ! moi lad's alive ! \" folded and placed the missive in her bosom, to bide content with the knowledge of that one great fact, and reserve the rest until the coming of Mary Jackson should supply an accredited and interested reader. For some occMt reason this did not suit Sally's notions ; she was as desirous to learn the contents of the sailor's epistle as if Jack had been her own brother or lover, and was not at all delicate in expressing her curiosity. \" Nell here con read th' letter fur yo' as weel as Meary ; aw dunno see how yo' han patience to wait.\" \" It isna' patience, but duty, lass ; aw dunno but th' letter's as mich fur Meary as fur me, an Meary moight na' loike a lot o' wenches hearin' a' Jack had to say.\" \" Aw shouldna' if 'twur me,\" quoth Nell. A frown and an impatient gesture alone showed Sarah's dis approbation of the girl's interference. \"An dunna yo' mean to see what's i'th box noather ? \" pressed she inquisitively. \" Not till Meary comes.\" \"Aw'll goo an' tell her, Mrs. Smith, when th' mill looses,\" promptly volunteered Sarah. \" George-Leigh Street's right i' College-Pincushion : The Chetham Hospital or Foundation School is called \" The College ; \" the blue-coat boys used to make balls and pi n cushions peculiarly worked with coloured worsteds ; and sell them when the college museum was open at Easter and Whitsuntide.

Mother ! an' so our Jack's back at last ! I'm fit to cry for joy ! \" exclaimed Mary, as she flew down the steps and hugged Jack's representative m the doorway. \" Where's Ms letter ? \" The two anxious women sat down at the round table, on which stood a lighted candle m a tall hon candlestick, worn to a polish with good rubbing, to discuss the letter in its light, unconscious that there were listemng ears on the alert besides their own. In the fulness of their emotions Sarah Duckworth had been forgotten, and the lips of the shutters were closed, when with stealthy tread she crept down the steps, and so placed herself by the open door as to lose no syllable of aught spoken within. Passers-by saw only a woman lolling idly agamst the wall m the cool of the evening. Thanks to the Lancasterian School and Bennett Street Sunday School, Mary was a tolerable scholar for her station, whilst Jack's sole writing-master had been a well-disposed purser's mate ; and she read with comparative ease that which he had penned with infinite pains and difficulty. We need not follow Jack in Ms discursive wandermgs over sea or over paper. Suffice that amongst other adventures he recounted the capture of a Mahratta phase, and the sudden desertion of the junk by the murderous crew ; on which Jack suspected treachery, and hurried below just in time to whip off a burnmg fuse from a cask of gunpowder. In less than two minutes the junk and its captor3 would have been swept into eternity. For this coolness and bravery he had been well rewarded.

Well, aw've not barkened for nowt ! An' now aw'd best be off,\" and before the letter came to a conclusion she had crept away as stealthily as she had crept down. The reading of the epistle had been frequently interrupted by ejaculations and comments on the bravery, constancy, and generosity of the writer, whose promotion was voted to be oMy a fitting testimony to Ms manifold merits. \" Tha's not gooin' afore tha's looked o'er th' chest ! \" cried Nan, as Mary, surrendering the letter, rose to depart. \" Yea, I must; look at th' clock !

She entered, almost simultaneously with Nell, to echo her rapturous exclamations at the unwonted display. \" Wherever did yo' get them beauties, Nan ? they're fit fur Mrs. Brookes, or Lady Lever,*\" asked Nell, as she emptied her basket, and Nan stowed the provisions away. \"They cam' i' Jack's chest, wi' a lot more things,\" answered Nan, quietly, with commendable reticence ; adding, \" If tha'lt have tay wi' us, Nell, tha'rt heartily welcome.

Privateermg was obviously different from the merchant service. There were grotesque Chinese vases and Indian fans ; Hindoo slippers and a gilded idol, to be examined, admired, and put on the table for safety. Then came what Jack had called a workbox, m reality an ivory casket exquisitely carved, and in it was a medley of trinkets of value and uses almost unknown either to Jack or his sweetheart. As Mary drew them forth \u2014 bangles, bracelets, rings, beads, filigree-earrings \u2014 and saw them sparkle in the light, nature asserted itself, and, much as Sarah had done, she adorned herself to admire their beauty m the looMng-glass, aud estimate their worth as a true-love gift. As such it was a double joy to wear them ; and, laymg the casket on the table, she went back to her pleasurable task, the jewels flashmg, sparkling, ghttermg with every motion, glorious m the sight of more eyes than Nan's. There were lustrous silks that had to be opened and held up to shimmer in the light, a Cashmere shawl, a couple of light scarfs of Indian crape, a piece of filmy India-muslin, spotted as if with hailstones, with many odd matters, besides the mariner's own garments. Bed, table, and chairs were occupied as they had never been before. Deep m one corner of the box lay a canvas bag. Clearing a space on the table, they turned forth a mass of gold and a small roll of notes. Exclamations of surprise and delight burst from their lips, and then they stared at one another in blank amaze ment. Never had such a heap of gold met their gaze before ; and to think it was their own \u2014 all their own ! In vain they tried to count it ; agitation and the admixture of foreign corns \u2014 gold Napoleons and Indian mohurs \u2014 with the English guineas, effectually interposed, so, putting the money back in the bag, they replaced it in the box, unconscious that greedy eyes had been watching them through the eyelet in a shutter counting the gold for them, whilst greedy fingers had twitched nervously to grasp it. Foldmg up silk and muslin, tallring cheerily of the future, congratulating themselves on Jack's good fortune, speculating on Ms appearance, the watchman's droning cry, \" Past nme o'clock, an' a some mooMeet neet,\" roused them to the flight of time. \" Eh, mother, I must be off. I got such a ricking* the other night for staying so late,- and to-morrow's Whit-Sunday, of all days in the year. I must be m Bennett Street betimes to go with * Ricking\u2014 A. scolding ; a watchman's rattle is called a rick in Lancashire."], [244, "232 THE INDIAN SCAEF. my class to church. You'll not mmd putting the things back, mother, will you ? \" hurriedly spake Mary, hastily divesting herself of her jewellery, and replacing the trinkets in her casket. \" Not aw ! an' aw'd be loth to have thee bleamed fur nowt. Thou'rt a good lass, God bless thee ! an' aw' hope thee an' Jack may be happy together.\" \"Amen to that, mother. Good night, and be sure to bolt the door.\" \" Good neet, and God bless thee.\" A kiss, and Mary was gone, bearing her precious casket with her. , , Nan had yet another guest that night \u2014 a guest whose entrance was unobserved from without. But the drowsy watchman, going his rounds aster midmght, saw a sailor in the doorway, and again later on, seated on the rad, leaning against the cross bar, and said to himself, \" Th' widow's sailor lad's come whoam at last ! \" CHAPTER III. Whit-Sunday, the first of June \u2014 bright and glorious as cloudless skies and a glowing sun could make it \u2014 a day of rejoicmg on earth and in air ! \u2014 What was it to Ann Smith ? The milkman, serving his customers in the house overhead, remarked to the maid as he returned her jug : \" Nan Smith's shutters are fast ; I reckon she's off holiday-making this fine day. I hope it'll do her good, poor soM ! \" \" Like enough,\" was the rejoinder, \" for that sailor-lad of hers has come back : aw saw him hanging about afore other folk wur stirrin' ; for aw wur up wi' th' lark to get forrad wi' mi work, to goo ofl'mysel.\" Monday afternoon brought Ellen Clough for the promised keepsake. Shutters and doors still closed. She knocked : there was no response. \" Wheere can Nan be off to aw wonder ? Happen wi' Meary. Hoo said they'd some business to talk ower.\" In the evenmg she came agam : all was closed and silent as before. Tuesday morning saw her at the door again : still all silent as a tomb ! Nell was perplexed. A namele 's dread came over her. \" Aw've hauf a moind to goo to Meary Jackson's an' see if hoo knows owt o' Nan. Aw conna' mak' it eawt,\" murmured she to"], [245, "233 THE INDIAN SCARF. herself ; and with the thought she sped to George-Leigh Street. \" Shutters not open! \u2014 closed all yesterday!\" echoed Mary, in apprehension. \" What can have happened ? \" \" Happened ? Whoi, what should ha' happened ? Dun you think owt's* wrong ? \" Mary, flinging her shawl over her head, answered, \"I'm afraid to think. Mrs. Smith would never lock up the cellar and leave it, with all that money there ! \" \" Money ! what money ? \" asked Nell, bewildered. \" Oh, never mind,\" replied Mary, colouring, as if caught in a trap. Door and shutters closed ; silence, as of death m the cellar. Mary's agitated inquiry at the house door but elicited the supposition that \" Nan's off wi that sailor-lad o' hers, as come home on Setturday neet.\" \" But he didn't come home on Saturday night ; he's not coming till to-morrow.\" \"How dun yo' know he didno' come o' Setturday ? Aw seed him,\" was the servant's sharp retort. Mary's heart died withm her. \" You saw him ?\" said she faintly. What could this mean ? The girl eyed her curiously. Mrs. Barker and her husband came to the door. Saying it \" looked queer, very queer,\" he strove to peer into the cellar tMough one eyelet in the shutter, lit by a sun ray through the other. The thin lme of light revealed nothing but disorder. The gathering crowd grew excited. Ann was known to be neat and orderly. One after another peeped in through the shutters. A constable was brought \u2014 the door forced. Well might Mary stand aghast, and Ellen wringher hands! Coffer and chest were both rifled, and, in the deep shadow of the batting frame, lay Ann Smith on the floor ; her limbs drawn up, her face discoloured, an hulian scarf twisted round her tMoat \u2014 strangled ! \" Murder ! murder ! \" sMieked Mary. \" Murder ! murder ! \" rang through the shuddering crowd, and every nook and alley in the town caught up the echoes, to answer back\u2014 \" Who did it ?\" Wednesday passed, Thursday came, yet Jack had not put m an appearance, and Mary was distracted. It got rumoured abroad that Mary was the last person seen with the murdered woman ; had dropped a Mnt of money m the cellar ; had been * Out. \u2014 Aught, anything."], [246, "234 THE INDIAN SCAEF. the first to apprehend evil ; and whispering acquaintances looked askance and held aloof from her. On Thursday, Mr. Nathaniel MiMe, the coroner, held an inquest on the body, at the Royal Oak. Several witnesses proved the coming of the sea-chest, and the first opening of the letter, but oMy Mary Jackson could reveal the contents of either ; and she, bitterly distressed by her dear friend's death, coMounded by the non-arrival of Jack, awed by the presence of the coroner, and bewildered by the questions put to her, answered somewhat hesitatingly. Was not the story of her love involved ? and how could she reveal that to strangers ? It was drawn from her, however. But when she had told Jack's request that his mother should put in the banns to be cried on Whit-Sunday, and that the ivory workbox should be given to her, the coroner wMspered to the clerk, who wrote sometMng on a paper, which was passed to an official, and he, taking another by the sleeve, left the room. From Ellen Clough the coroner elicited that the letter was a long one, and commenced, \" Dear and honoured mother ; \" that Mrs. Smith had sent for Mary to read it to her ; that after marketing for her on Saturday, the 31st of May, she had taken tea with her and Mary ; during tea allusions were made to Jack's letter and adventures ; that, on hesitating to accept a gift from Mrs. Smith, Mary had looked at her pointedly and remarked, \"that whatever Mrs. Smith offered her she might take without scruple, since Jack had sent many things she would never wear herself ; \" that Nan gave her a hint to go, having business to talk over with Mary ; that she left the two together, and never saw the elder woman alive again. She also told of finding the place shut up, of going to mform Mary, and her immediate pallor and apprehension that something had happened, connectmg it with \" all that money.\" As Nell became aware of the drift of the questions asked, and the drift of her own evidence, she grew reluctant to speak ; and thus gave greater force to all she did say. The watchman and Barker's maid alike testified to seeing the sailor in the early morning ; Mr. Barker and others to the finding of the body, with the Indian scarf twisted round the throat, to the open chest, and the absence of valuables of any kind. Search for the sailor had been ineffectual. The coroner's messengers returned. One brought Mary's ivory casket, full of costly trinkets, a new Barcelona silk kerchief like that worn by the murdered woman, and a carved fan \u2014 all from"], [247, "THE INDIAN SCARF. 235 Mary's drawer at home. He stated that no letter could be found, but there were ashes of burnt paper in Ann Smith's grate. His fellow-constable brought word from the vestry-clerk of the Old Church that no banns between John Smith and Mary Jackson had been put m by any one within the time named. Mr. Milne looked grave. Had any one seen Mary Jackson go home on Saturday night ? No one ! Her father had sat up until nme o'clock, and gone to bed leaving the door on the latch. Fell asleep at once ; did not hear her come in. The mquiry lasted two days ; still neither Jack nor any other sailor was forthcoming. Alas ! for poor Mary ! Her own simple statement discredited, her affection for the dead woman ignored, her possession of the casket and jewels misconstrued ! On the supposition of a quarrel arismg out of \" the business to be talked over,\" and the valuables yet undiscovered\u2014 the victim of circumstantial evidence \u2014 a. verdict was recorded of \" Wilful murder against Mary Jackson, and a supposed sailor unknown.\" Committed to the New Bailey, to be removed to Lancaster for trial, she was taken into custody, and led, handcuffed, through the streets, followed by a mob, peltmg her with epithets harder than stones ; her own protestations of innocence, of course, dis regarded. Where was Jack Smith the while ? CHAPTER TV. Up bill and down dale are the Derbyshire roads, even after frequent levellings ; and in 1805 they were as precipitous as picturesque. No wonder, then, when the accredited driver of the London mail coach weakly entrusted his reins to a dashing amateur Jehu, that, in turnmg a sharp corner at the foot of a steep hill, a wheel caught the embankment, and broke to splinters, overturnmg the coach with a crash, and sending the outside passengers flying like shuttlecocks from a battledore. As the resMt of this accident, m a wayside farmhouse some three miles from Ashbourne, the doors of which had been humanely thrown open to them, lay Jack Smith and bis mess mate, Will Bradley, the former with a broken arm, the latter with a sprained ankle, both sadly cut and bruised. In iMand rural districts news from the coast or the sea was precious, and so our two seafaring men were not oMy hospitably"], [248, "236 THE INDIAN SCARF. welcomed, but parted with reluctantly by the farmer and his family, when the country Esculapius, deferringto their impatience rather than to his pocket, admitted that Will might use his foot \" in moderation.\" Not very moderate, however, was bis use of it ; seeing that the pair, whose anathemas of stage-coaches had been both loud and deep, resolved to make their own limbs carry them to Manchester, and straightway put the resolve into practice. Ann Smith had been buried three weeks when the two dusty, weary, footsore men, plodding and limping along with high hope and expectation damped by strange forebodings, turned off from the Stockport Road at Ardwick Green, and, passmg the Manor House, took a footpath across the fields to Ancoats, about noon. \" I say, Jack,\" said Will, as they were passing Pollard's factory, \" how the folks do stare at us. The land-lubbers might never have see'd a Jack-tar afore.\" \"Nay,\" replied Jack, \"it's just the figures we cut. Don't we look as if we'd been in the wars, with these cursed plasters and bandages, and this sling ? Our own mothers will hardly know us.\" \" Well, they do stare uncommon, an' that's a fact.\" They had reached Newton Street, where a few cottages nestled beneath the shadow of a large private house, even then sub divided to accommodate tenants. There Jack would fain have said \" Good-bye \" to his companion, and trudged onwards, but Will would not hear of this. \"Nay, messmate; never sheer off without seeing the old woman an' Jenny, within sight of the port. 'Taint jannock ! Just give her a shake o' yer flipper, an' crowd sail for Oak Street.\" Jack yielded. They stopped before the second house in the street. Stopped \u2014 looked at the house \u2014 looked at each other \u2014 with a sudden catching of the breath. The house was closed, and on each of the folding shutters was chalked \" To let,\" in large characters. Will threw down his stick and bundle on the unpaved pathway, and drew his hand across his eyes with a gesture of hopelessness. Children playing round the next door ran in to tell their mammy of the two strange men, and she, coming forward, gave what information she could. \" 'T woman an' wench as lived theer made a moonleet flitt o' Whissunday, when th' neebors wur a' abed or pleasurin'. An' good shuttance to 'em, aw say, fur th' lass wur a brazen hussy, an' th' mother wur a downreet bad un.\""], [249, "THE INDIAN SCARF. 237 Will's face flushed : a fiery answer was on his lips. Jack, early schooled to control his temper, interposed. \"There must be some mistake here, missis; Bet Bradley and her daughter Jenny were both as taut an' trim as any craft afloat, an' \" \" Bradley ! aw sed nowt, an' know nowt, o' anny Bradleys ; them as lived here th' last three year wur neamed Duck'orth \u2014 Sally Duck'orth boath on 'em ! \" Will's heart sank lower. Mother and sister both gone. Where were they ? and where his kit ? On further questioning they found that such a chest had been brought by a carrier, and that old Sally Duckworth had given out it had come from her nephew m Liverpool. \" Happen tiandlord, Mester John Dannis, of Owdham Street, con tell yo' summat moore,\" suggested the woman. With thanks for the hmt they bent their steps thither, just stopping at the Cotton Tree by the way for a glass of grog and a moutMul of bread and cheese ; for the claims of thirst and hunger must be appeased whether we sorrow or rejoice. George-Leigh Street lay in their route, and Will, true friend as ever, waived his own anxieties that Jack might take Mary by surprise, and once more clasp his sweetheart to his breast. Alas for human hopes ! How crushing a blow awaited him ! His beloved and honoured mother foully murdered ! the cherished love of his youth and manhood imprisoned as her murderess\u2014 suspicion pomting to himself or Will as her accomplice ! Who shall depict his anguish under each successive shock ? \" We came ashore on a Friday, Jack, an' we took our places on that d \u2014 d coach on a Friday, and here, as ill luck would have it, we are on a Friday agam, d \u2014 n it ! an' there's neither home nor friends nor money left for either of us ! \" burst from Will m a passion of sailor-like superstition and excitement. Jack sat stupefied by the fireside where Mary had been wont to sit with him, hardly able to realise his full position, but not for one mstant condemning her. Absorbed m his greater sorrow he had lost sight of the fact that all he had fought for and toiled for was gone \u2014 that a few gumeas were all that remained to either of them. Roused by Will's exclamation, he rose, and, mastering his own grief by a noble effort, led the way towards Oldham Street, then composed of private houses oMy. They found Mr. Daniels at tea. He was a man of noble presence, specMess in attire, with light kerseymere smalls buckled"], [250, "238 THE INDIAN SCARF. .at the knee, plum-coloured coat and deep waistcoat, with ruffles at his wrists, and hah white alike with powder and age. \" Well, my men, what can I do for you ? \" he asked, as he came to them in the hall. \"Why, sir,\" said Will, \"we've just run ashore among the breakers, and thought maybe your honour might show us a light or a compass to steer by. I'm Will Bradley, Betty Bradley's lad, her as had a house o' yours in Newton Street. Can you tell me what has become of her, or of my sister ? I sent my kit home with my prize money m it a month ago, and now I find the dead lights up and the house to let.\" A shade passed over the old gentleman's face. \" Walk m here,\" said he, opening a room door with the courtesy of an olden school. \"Be seated.\" Then, kindly and gently he told the young man that his mother had been dead more than three years, and that his sister had gone to live in Yorkshire with her husband, having married a man whose name he did not remember. The Duckworths succeeded to the tenancy, and he feared that, tempted by the gold in his chest, they had absconded with the property. Much more he said ; ques tioned Will as to his means, and evinced so strong a disposition to serve the poor fellow, that Jack took heart, and laid his case too before Mr. Daniels, saymg as his apology, \" You see, sir, we sailors, smart as we may be on deck, are as ignorant of landsmen's ways on shore as a land-lubber would be of our ways aboard ship.\" Mr. Daniels, however, knew more of the matter than did Jack. He had been present during the inquest, and, remembering the evidence, put a number of questions to the sailor, all tending to establish m his mind the innocence of the accused girl, even had Jack not been so persistent. \" She do it, sir ! don't believe it, sir. She was a good lass, and knew the money was as much hers as mine ; and the ivory box was hers, and the things in it. She harm a hair of mother's head ! not her.\" Evening had crept on with the consultation. \" My lads,\" said Mr. Daniels, Mndly, \" if a constable sees a sailor going about this neighbourhood, he is sure to take him up on suspicion ; so I advise you to keep close. My putter-out lives close by in Garden Street. A servant shall take you there by the back way, and he will find you accommodation for the night. Mr. Milne, the coroner, is a friend of mine ; I will consult him. Be assured I will do the best I can for you. Never mind thanking me, my men ; I have done nothing as yet. Yours are not only two cases of peculiar hardship, but singularly coincident. My interest is aroused, and I would see justice done.\""], [251, "239 THE INDIAN SCARF. He was as good as his word. He went at once to the Bridge water Arms, and ascertained that the London mail coach had been overturned on Whit-Tuesday, near Ashbourne, and that two sailors, booked at the Swan-with-two-necks, Lad Lane, London, were among the passengers injured. From Messrs. Pickford's he learned that they had delivered a sea-chest at 2, Newton Street, addressed to Betty Bradley, and that the recipient, unable to write, had made her mark, x, in their delivery book. Armed with these facts, he was in Bow Street as soon as Mr. Milne's office was open in the morning, and, at his suggestion, Mr. Daniels went with the two unfortunate sailors before John Leaf, Esq., the sitting magistrate, to make their statement. It was essential to clear themselves from the possible ignommy of a great crime, and to take measures for the recovery of the purloined property. It was evident that men who were at the London booking office on Friday night, May 30th, and who left that office by the mail on Monday, June 1st, could not have participated in a murder 187 miles away m the interim. Moreover, they were both dark-haired, sunburned men ; and the lock of hair in the dead woman's grip was of that deep yellow commonly called red. There coMd be no charge against them, and the case against Mary Jackson had assumed a different aspect. Agam the question arose, \" Who did it? \" From the magistrate on the bench to the lowest underling all compassionated the two sailors, m the very heyday of their joy disabled and deprived alike of friends and fortune. \" It's not for the money I care, your honours,\" said Jack, \" but to find my mother in her grave, murdered, aster all these years, for the sake of the very gold I had risked my life to earn for her ; and to find my darling lass m prison with the gallows pointmg its ugly arm in her innocent face, is more than I can bear ; \" and the rough sailor wiped, with the back of his uninjured hand, the scaldmg tears that would well up and brim over. CHAPTER V. Wh.it was the New Bailey Prison of that date \u2014 a tall, cross shaped, polyangMar building, designed by John Howard, the philantMopist \u2014 now Mdes its darkened head amongst a labyrinth of yards and wards, which an Mcrease of population and a \u25a0consequent mcrease of crime have rendered necessary. To a disaffected populace of a later date we owe also the elevation and"], [252, "240 THE INDIAN SCARF. extension of those massive walls, pierced with loopholes and turreted for defence.* Still the walls were high and blank enough to chill the heart of one whose best beloved pined incarcerated behmd them, and Jack, for whom Mr. Daniels had obtamed an order to visit Mary Jackson, felt as if the grim fetters suspended over the main entrance were symbolic of an iron bondage even mnocence would be powerless to escape from. They were allowed to meet in private. He clasped her in his one arm, and she clung about his neck ; but \"Oh, Jack ! \" and \" Oh, Mary ! \" was all they could utter, strong emotion over powering speech. \" Oh, Jack, this is a dreadful place to find me in,\" she sobbed forth at length ; \" but I know you do not think me guilty of so horrible a crime.\" \" Me, Mary ! God bless you, lass, I'd as soon suspect myself ! There, there now, cheer up ! You've got a good friend will pilot you out of the shoals.\" \" Ah, Jack, you are a good friend ; but you don't know how them lawyers get things out of folks, and piece together bits of truth in such a way as to make great lies out of them ; and perhaps they'll not believe you any more than me.\" \" Nay, lass, it's Betty Bradley's old landlord \u2014 he's the friend I mean ; I'm nowheere. But tell me all you know about it.\" What she knew was little enough, but she would tell nothing until her eager inquiries about his visible injuries were answered. Will Bradley was of course mentioned, and the loss he had sustained at the hands of the treacherous Duckworths. At the name of Duckworth Mary started. \" What ! Sally Duckworth gone off with Will's kit ! and on Whit-Sunday, too ! Oh, Jack, it was Sally as fetched me to read your letter. Do you think she listened ? \u2014 for the door was open though the shutters were to \u2014 and Jack, dear Jack (she seemed ready to faint), Sally has frizzy red hair ! \" In the new light thus tMown upon the mystery, and m the face of Jack's declaration that the ivory casket and jewels bad been his gift to Mary, and Ms full recapitulation of his own letter, even to the request about the banns, and from the absence of all known motive to murder, the trial of Mary, at Lancaster, could only end in her acquittal ; though for a long time doubt held the balance suspended. A fervent \" Thank God ! \" burst from more lips than one as * Since this story was written, the New Bailey has been swept from its place on the Salford side of the Irwell, and the Old Bailey, London, is doomed."], [253, "241 THE INDIAN SCARF. the jury returned their verdict of \" Not guilty ; \" and Mary \u2014 the tension of her nerves on the rebound \u2014 fainted. One incident of the trial must be recorded, The Indian scarf found twisted round the murdered woman's throat was produced in court. It was of delicate white crape, with an intricate and peculiar pattern woven in colours at each end. When Jack was called upon to identify this as his property, he explained, regard less of order, \" My lord, there were two on' em, and t'other's gone ! Whoever has the fellow scarf killed my mother, and I'll track it out if I sail the world for it ! \" Beyond the colour of her hah, and her disappearance with Will Bradley's Mt, simultaneously with the murder of Ann Smith, there was nothing to identify Sally Duckworth with that terrible crime ; yet though she and her mother were both proclaimed in the Hue and Cry, they might have sunk into the earth for all that was heard of them, and the murder became a deeper mystery than ever. The few guineas m the pockets of the sailors when they were stranded in Manchester had long been expended ; but, fortunately for them, Will had reserved a couple of necMaces, of that extra length in favour with Asiatic wearers, for pre sentation to his sister. These he was anxious to sell for what he could get. Mr. Daniels, seeing the eyes of daughters and niece sparMe at the sight, and ignorant of their value, took the sailor and his beads to Mr. Ollivant's shop, in the Market Place. Under the supposition that they were for sale the shopkeeper said, \" The value of these things depends on fasMon ; we should only cut them for setting. We cannot give more than \u00a310 for the crystal necMace, and M8 for the garnet.\" \"I am about to buy, not to sell,\" said Mr. Daniels, dryly. \"Ah, well then, we cannot tell their value,\" was the reply. The necklaces, however, passed to Mr. Daniel's daughters and meee, and more than twenty guineas into Will's pocket. This the generous fellow insisted on sharing with Jack, nothing doubting that his messmate would have shared with him in like circumstances. Fain would Mary have pressed upon her lover the fatal casket and its contents ; but he sturdily refused, and Will upheld him. Their resources being exhausted in waiting till the trial was over, there was no chance of staying ashore. To sea they must go again. Yet they both went reluctantly, for Will had been somewhat taken with Ellen Clough's manner in giving her evidence in R"], [254, "242 THE INDIAN SCARF. court ; and Jack was most anxious to make Mary his wife ere he tried the deep again. But no entreaties of his would move her. There was a stain of blood upon her name if not on her hands. Censorious people whispered furtively of \" sudden quarrels \" and \"manslaughter,\" and so on ; and, until the real murderer was discovered, she could not be Ms wife, dearly as she loved him. \" ' Murder will out,' and some day I may marry you without blame or reproach. Now, for your own sake I must not.\" Thus she thought and spoke, even through her tears ; and not all Jack's unstudied eloquence could shake her resolution. Far from content he bade her farewell, and with Will set out to seek fortune once more on the broad ocean. They had had enough of warfare, and Mr. Daniels had used his influence to obtain good berths for the despoiled seamen ; so they sailed for Massachusetts in the \" Ariadne,\" a first-class merchantman trading between England and America, Will as first and Jack as second mate. The old manufacturer, desirous still more to serve the son of his old tenant, entrusted him with goods that he might at the same time do a little trading on his own account. It was at that delicious season at the fall of the year known as the \" Indian Summer \" when they sailed into Boston harbour, and anchored off the Old Wharf. For some time duty kept them pretty close to the ship ; but Will, as Jack's first-officer, was less tied, and was more at Ms own disposal. American independence was a thing of so recent date, and the part Boston had played in the war so prominent, that the rough sailor regarded the city with more than common interest ; and, taking his trading commission as an excuse, bewildered himself in the intricacies of the zig-zag streets, searching out noteworthy places, from Faneuil Hall to Bunker's Hill. He took his grog at Province House, then a bar-room, and strayed away to the Common to watch the gay and fashionable promen aders under its magnificent trees, and around its Frog-pond. On the fost of these occasions he was struck by an unmistakable Lancashire voice proceeding from a pah of handsome but resolute lips, owned by a good-looking, richly-attired damsel, seated with a more matronly woman near the old elm which was a forest patriarch when the Pilgrim Fathers landed in New England. He saw that there was nothing bashful in the blue eyes that followed his steps as he passed and re-passed, shortening Ms promenade each time, until finally he also took a seat on the roomy bench, with a hope that he was not intruding, followed by a remark on the weather. He was answered with less reserve"], [255, "243 THE INDIAN SCARF. than he anticipated, and, the ice being broken, he sought to -extend the colloquy. But the elder woman, apparently a relative, did not seem to approve this. She twitched the sleeve of her companion, and Will caught a low whisper, \" Come away, how dun we know who he may be ? \" Twitch and whisper were alike unheeded ; the fair one with the golden locks seemed to have a will of her own, and did not \" come away \" or drop the conversation ; and to Will, whose school had been a rough one, whose society that of the deck and the docks, the full Doric of Ms native place sounded like music. He listened .and thought of Ellen Clough ; he looked in the steel blue eyes, and on the golden hair, to institute comparisons ; but somehow those blue eyes had a strange fascination in them, and admira tion looked out of his dark ones. Agam the duenna plucked the other's sleeve uneasily ; then Tose, saying, \" Come, Miss Dalton, it's toime we wur at whoam.\" .\" I shall be glad to walk with you a little way, if agreeable,\" said Will. \" An' who be you that thrust yoursel' forrad to walk wi' strange ladies ? \" sharply mterrogated the matron. \" flush, mother, don't be rude,\" interposed Miss Dalton. \" I am Captain Spencer, of the ' Ariadne,' just come into port,\" answered Will, readily. The matron seemed appeased ; possibly the mate's gold lace and buttons verified Ms sailor-like fiction, and the title soothed her. He did not intrude upon their walk. He had, however, ascertamed that they frequently promenaded upon the Common, and contrived to meet them the next evening, and the next, until they became quite friendly, and modest Ellen Clough was fast vanishing in the distance. His subordinate was treated with glowmg descriptions of the beautiful blue-eyed Miss Dalton, and the style the Daltons lived In (style of course reckoned from Will's standard). At first he seemed m no hurry to introduce Jack ; but, having made himself secure in the lady's good graces, aided by a graceful present or two, he became desirous to have Jack's opinion of her fascinations, not doubting he would admire her. A public ball gave him the opportunity. He presented Mrs. and Miss Dalton with tickets, and arranged to meet them with a friend. It was a mixed ball, to which money was the sole passport. As well as oil and candles would light a ballroom, that was lit ; and"], [256, "244 THE INDIAN SCARF. as the two mates entered at the door they saw, at the upper end,. the centre of a group of dandies \u2014 for there were dandies even m New England \u2014 Miss Dalton, arrayed in a filmy dress of virgin white, a light scarf floating over her shoulders, and, with smgular want of taste, a wreath of brilliant flowers in her hah. By her side the portly matron bloomed m a costly silk dress of changmg hue and lustrous sheen ; while, dragged over her shoulders like an Indian's blanket, was an embroidered Canton-crape shawl fit for a countess. As they advanced Jack clutched Will Bradley's arm with a convulsive grasp. \" Will, Will, look at yon girl in the white spotted muslin ! \" \" What's the matter, Jack? That's Miss Dalton; isn't she a lovely craft? \" \" Craft, mdeed ! \" groaned Jack, pulling Ms amazed friend back into a recess. \" Will, look at her hah, those feather flowers, that dress, that scarf, her mother's silken dress! Will, that girl murdered my mother !\" \" And, by George ! her mother's shawl came out of my kit! Come along ! \" And the impMsive mate of the \" Ariadne\" hurried up the room, drawmg his agitated friend with Mm ere he had time to collect bis thoughts. \" Sally Duckworth, my mate here, Jack Smith, wants to know how you left his mother last Whitsun-eve, an' how you came by your fine toggery ! \" The girl went white as death, and with a faint shriek sank shuddering on the nearest seat. The mother strove to brazen it out. \" Sally Duckworth, indeed ! What dun yo' mean, Captain Spencer ? \" \" Mean ! that I'm no more Captam Spencer than you're Mrs. Dalton ! I'm Will Bradley, mate of the ' Ariadne,' an' you're a runaway thief from Newton Street, Manchester, an' that's my shawl you've got on ; an' your fine silk dress belongs to Jack here.\" It was for her to recoil now.

CHAPTER I. Dufton's Mill was a noteworthy feature in the landscape,, seeing that it had a fair background of trees, and stood otherwise alone on one of the many tributaries of the Thames, not even a cottage coming into view witMn a quarter of a mile, and the country around being somewhat flat and sparsely wooded. An ait in the winding river, by dividing the stream, had offered an opportunity for the construction of a dam, and there the mill wheel went merrily round, making music with the water and in the good miller's pockets, and M the breasts of his wife and daughter, whose voices often kept it company in cheery songs of their own. A sturdy, round-faced, good-tempered sort of fellow was the miller, and his daughter, a girl of some sixteen years, seemed pretty much of the same pattern. Mrs. Dufton was cast in a very different mould ; had high-cheek bones, a promment and decidedly masculine nose, a broad high forehead, and a somewhat hard set of mouth. But, bless your life, she was as kind at heart as Dufton himself, and that was saying much. There wasn't a beggar or a tramp who came that way without finding it out, and the miller knew it well, or he would not have tested it so often in bringing home weary strangers he found wandering in the byeways in search of shelter. She had known what it was to wander, and want a home and a shelter, but it is not everyone who is so ready to turn personal experience to such practical account for the good of others. The mill I have told you stood in a lonely spot, apart from other habitations ; and throughout every night in their lives a lamp was kept burning in the miller's own bedroom, so as to serve as a beacon to any poor wanderer gone astray. It so happened one stormy Mght in October, when the miller had promised to bring home in his cart from the market town the weekly supplies of meat and groceries (it being no day, he said, for a woman to venture out, when somebody else, who could do her business for her was compelled to go), that he brought home in his cart more than he went for, or than his wife expected."], [259, "247 THE RUNAWAY. Seated on empty sacks in the cart was a girl not much older than their Madge, whose skirts were drenched and bedrabbled, though their texture was superfine and their fashion new, whilst the feather in her Rubens' hat hung limp and flabby. But her dress was torn, and her gloveless hands swollen and discoloured with cold and wet. \" There, wife,\" quoth the miller, \"I've brought you a drowned Mtten to take care of \u2014 a runaway.\" \"A runaway? \" she echoed, in a sorrowful, half- questioning tone, looking hard at the girl, who covered her face with her hands and sobbed. \" Aye, a runaway. I found her leamng against the finger-post at the cross-roads, not knowing where to go, or which way to turn, so I thought I'd best bring her here, and see what was to be done with her in the morning. As we came in the cart she told me she had been for tMee or four years living with an old aunt, and the aunt was grown so hard and cross she had determined to run away and get her own living somehow, either as a governess, or a music-mistress, or something. It's well I had a lantern on the shaft, or there might have been a runover, as well as a run away, in the dark. Now, take off your wet things, my lass, and sit down. My wife will take care of you, for this night. And hark, thee! Madge,\" to his daughter, \" bestir thyself and help mother to get some dry clothes and warm supper for both of us, whilst I look after the poor horse.\" \" Aye, the merciful man is merciful to his beast,\" murmured Mrs. Dufton man undertone ; \" but how came you to be in this plight, if the story you tell is true ? \" she asked searchingly, as she helped to peel off the saturated cloth jacket which clung to the slim form of the girl like a skin. \"You could not expect to get into a respectable situation without even a change of garments.\" \" I had a black leather bag with me when I left Aunt Clifford's. But I set off before daylight to catch the first train to London at a station where I was not known, and I had to go tMough the lanes and fields. I thought I was quite safe,\" she sobbed, \" but in crossmg one of the fields I met three or four navvies, and they caught hold of me and tore out my earrings and my brooch, and stripped off my gloves and my rings, and my watch, and went off with them and my bag. I screamed and struggled, and said they would leave me penniless, but they only told me to ' hold my row, or they would murder me.' I had no money for the train, and I dared not go back to my aunt, and I have been walking on all day in the rain.

But put on these dry shoes before my good man comes in, and then you'll be ready for the pea-soup Madge is pouring out ; Miss ? \" \"Murray,\" said the young lady faintly, as if half ashamed to make her identity known, but grateful for the shelter she had found, so different from all she had pictured. In came the miller again as blythe as a bee, blew out his lantern and hung it on a nail, and aster taking off his wet boots and tMusting his big feet into slippers, sat down rubbmg the palms of his hands together briskly. \" Now, miss,\" said he, \" sit down and let us thank God for sending you in my way, and to a roof and a warm supper this terrible night, though they mayn't be what you've been used to ; they may be more than you deserve.\" \" How so ? \" asked his wife, when the short grace was ended, and as if she wondered what was lest untold. \" Well, I thmk you'll say so too wife, when I tell you she ran away for nothing more than a hasty quarrel with a good aunt because she took too much care of her.\" There was a sudden flash in the black eyes bent over the pea soup, but never a word from the lips. \" How so ? \" again put Mrs. Dufton. \"Well, Miss says her aunt msisted on seeing a letter she received, and on dictating the answer, and she thought she was old enough to judge for herself.\" \"And so I do!\" came with a peremptory burst from the seventeen-years-old lips. \" And old enough to face the world alone ? \" put the miller's wife with a curious look. \" Yes, if I had not been robbed,\" was the answer. \" Ah, my lass, I think my wife could tell you another tale than that ; a tale you'd best hear whilst your own misadventure is fresh. You may not be so confident when she has done,\" quoth the miller. \" Now wife ! \" There was very little hesitation, for Mrs. Dufton thought it was about time she read the foolish young person by the fire a lesson out of a living book ; a lesson that should set her thmking"], [261, "THE RUNAWAY. 249 \u2022of others as well as herself, and not to mistake fancied evils for real ones; and serve as a warning for her own Madge at the same time. \" Bless me ! how the wind rattles at the casement and door,\" she began, when Madge had cleared away the supper-things, as she took her knitting and sat down beside her husband in the glow of the fire, with the young girls opposite ; \"We maj* thank our stars \u2014 or thank God, which is much better \u2014 that w*e are comfortably housed on a night like this. You seem to think it right, Miss, to take an mdependent course, but let me tell you there will be anxious and sore hearts because of the uncertainty and fear what may have become of the misguided runaway, and I am afraid you hardly realize it. Think what it would be if the uncertainty and anxiety were to last for weeks, or months \u2014 or for ever ! Yet such thmgs have been, as I know to my sorrow, and will be agam whenever wilfulness, or restlessness, or self-importance tempts lad or lass to take the world on young shoulders without advice or knowledge of theh elders. There is no school so cold as that of the outer world, no relative so harsh as experience, no lot more lonely than that of one cast adrift by self. It is a risky thing to venture out mto the world alone and unfriended. \" I did it. And if it pleased Providence to save me from the worst consequences, that was no merit of mine. \"There are other thmgs besides love of adventure, or hasty temper, that tempt lads and lasses to steal away from home. I stole away from mine, and it may be a caution to you if I tell you all about it ; for I left those I loved dearly, and with the very best mtention ; but as I read once \u2014 ' Evil is wrought by want of thought As well as want of heart.' \" Well, you see what I am now \u2014 a stout, fresh-looking woman of forty, with a sprinklmg of grey hairs on my head, and a face that perhaps looks rather too cross sometimes ; but my girl here knows there is a mother's heart in my breast, whatever my face may betoken. \"I had always a rather masculine countenance and build, even when I was no more than Mneteen. \" At that time I had a brother Edgar, older than myself ; but -I was the eldest girl in a large family, and much drudgery had fallen to my share. It had not always been the case, for until my father \u2014 Edward Amsworth, a fustian manufacturer in Manchester \u2014 failed in business, we were all as well cared for and well educated as any of our class. \" But when he came down in the world tMngs were altered."], [262, "250 THE RUNAWAY. Father had to take a situation, and there being so many to keep, he advertised in the Guardian and got book-keeping and copying to do in the evening to supplement Ms salary. Edgar, two years older than myself, was articled to a solicitor named Bailey when the crash came. Of course, he had no salary, and, having a high spirit, could not brook dependence on his poor broken-down father. His master allowed him to bring home deeds to engross \u2014 paying him rather less than the law stationer's charges ; and, poor fellow, he sat up half the mght to earn what would barely clothe him as a gentleman, and keep him. \" I saw that his health was giving way, and I had fears for father too ; so I insisted on Madge and Polly taking a share of the house work and sewing, whilst I helped mother to educate the little ones, and at night I took a pen in hand to help, first father, and then Edgar. Of course I had first to learn book-keeping and a commercial hand, and then the stiff legal one. \" But love and resolution will accomplish more than that, and perhaps it was that same resolution and occupation wMch hardened and set my features in so manly a mould. \"Well, Edgar was barely out of his articles, and retamed by his governor at a respectable salary, with a hope of partnership in the long run, than, alack for all of us ; he fell ill and died. Too much work and too little play had been the death of him. \" It was very nearly the death of poor father, too. \" The hope and crown of his hopes was gone. The means to ' bury his dead ' and find sables for the mourners had to be found. \" Mother could only weep, and bewail the misfortune of having so many helpless girls to keep and clothe, and never a boy left old enough to take his brother's place. \" Her words stung me. I had done boy's work and ghi's work. She should see if I was helpless. \" Mother was sobbing in the kitchen ; Polly and Ben hung over her, attempting consolation ; Madge was in the scullery. \" I beckoned her upstairs into our little bed room. \" ' Madge,' said I, ' do you know where the money is to come from to bury our darling ? \" \" Madge shook her head, and I saw she would not trust herself to speak. \" ' I know how it may be done, if you will only consent,' I whispered, afraid of being overheard. \" ' We can sell our hair,' I went on in the same undertone.

Oh, Johanna ! ' was all that Madge could gasp. \" ' Yes, Madge darling, our hair will grow again as fast as the grass on the grave we buy with it. Has not Edgar sacrificed Ms very life for us ? Did the copying-pen leave his hand until Death took it ? ' \"There was a struggle such as you cannot understand ; but I conquered. Without giving her time to repent, I hurried her out of the house unseen. \"When we returned, two hours later, we had short crops under our bonnets, but w*e had also ten gumeas to pour in our mother's lap. \" When I had courage to look myself in the face through a glass I was struck with my boyish resemblance to my dead brother. \"I think it was that which first put my next project into my head, and once in I could not get it out. All things conspired to strengthen it. After the funeral I applied both to Mr. Bailey and the law stationer for deeds to copy or engross, urgmg that I had for some time assisted my brother ; but I think my mourning made less Mxpression on them than my cropped head, and that was not favourable. \" Twenty years ago girls did not poll their heads, and wear jerseys and jackets and hats like boys ; and twenty years ago the intrusion of women mto clerkships and scholarships was something to have uplifted respectable hands m dismay. \" They did not ask why niy hair was cropped short, they saw it was so cut, stared at me, no doubt thought me a bold-faced madam, and were curt enough in their refusal : ' We do not trust important documents to girls.' \"I then tried to get together a few pupils to teach with our youngsters.

In a few minutes I was in a third-class carriage on my way to London, with my carpet-bag, without an address, at my feet. \" So far, all had been hurry and excitement. Now, I had leisure to reflect. I had no friends in London, no motive in going thither, beyond the impossibility of taking a man's work in Manchester, where I and my family were known. \" I began to wonder if the letter I had lest on the kitchen dresser for father and mother made it clear enough that I had left them only out of love, and would be sure to let them hear from me as soon as I got into a good clerkship, and was able to send them a remittance. I wanted it clearly understood that I meant to help to keep the young ones, instead of bemg a dead weight upon them. The clothes I had left behmd I had said might be altered for Madge and Polly.

The followmg day I walked into the City. A book-keeper was wanted in a merchant's office. ' Your age, sir ? ' ' Twenty-one.' I was nearingit. ' Twenty-one, with that smooth chm. You look eighteen ; much too young. If you looked older you might pass. Stability is wanted here.' Again I went back disheartened. I had been nine months in London, barely keepmg life and soul together, and that with woman's work. My clothes were wearing shabby. I should be unable to renew them. And in all this time, I heard nothing from my home. Oh, how I longed to hear of them ! I began to dream of them ; of Madge with her radiant hair grown long again ; of father bent and worn with grief for me ; of mother querulously complaming of her children's helplessness. But I never dreamed of going back, or of writing home until I got employment. As I grew thinner, I think I lost something of my manly bearing. I know I was losing heart. Mr. Pulteney's room was crowded with miscellaneous matters m every spare nook ; books were piled on the floor for lack of shelves. One day he called me in. He had a box of tangled rubbish before him, ' See ! ' said he, as he dangled something black m my view ; ' here is something to add the growth of years to your face. I bought the thing for private theatricals when I was a young man and had money to throw away.' It was a black beard, somewhat dusty and mildewy, but of first-rate workmanship. I tried it on, and looked m the glass. It did give me the manliness I lacked. ' Keep it,' said the old gentleman. ' If it help you to a situation well and good. If not, you can pitch it into the fire.' I never thought of the deception I was about to practise. I only thought of getting a situation. I took my good landlady into my confidence over the beard, and she only laughed. Mr. Pnlteney did more : he wrote, in a very crabbed hand, a letter to an old legal friend, a Mr. Bunce, in Westminster, recom mending me as a copyMg-clerk."], [271, "THE RUNAWAY. 259 I had ceased to hope when I applied for -a situation now, and I might have been knocked down with a feather when I was told to come in the morning, and offered a pound a week, with an advance if I suited, A pound a week ! It seemed a fortune. I had not been earning ten shillings ; had drifted into arrears with Mrs. Moss ; my boots, once or twice repaired, tMeatened to part sole from body. Indeed, more than my boots had been in danger of that. I had taken to watching the river from the wharves and stairs, and to thinking how* soon the water would wash away all my sorrow and disappointment. Now all was changed. I hurried back to thank Mr. Pulteney. Next day I took my seat on a high stool \u2014 a clerk among the clerks \u2014 and, anxious to justify my appointment, applied myself sedulously to my task. It was a good step from Calthrop street to Westminster, and my breaM'ast was but dry toast and weak cocoa ; still I persevered ; though a crust of bread and cheese eaten in the street had to serve for dinner, and I had no better fare when I got home \u2014 the home I had made for myself. What a God-send was that first pound ! I paid for my lodgings that week, and got a cheap pair of second-hand boots, but I did not live on the fat of the land. Still I worked on hopefully, paying off arrears week by week, and faring something better. But I did not associate with my fellow-clerks. I had no money to waste in their ways ; and I shrank from much of their con versation, though I had heard and seen more wickedness as John Ainsworth than Johanna Ainsworth had ever supposed to exist. Then they were full of larks and pranks, and wasted the time for which their master paid them. I did not, and they dubbed me a sneak and a cant, and played off practical jokes upon me. The last had well-nigh proved fatal to me. I was set to make a fair copy of a draught will, and I made it. When my new master came to read it out to his client prior to signature he came across an interpolation which to his legal mind was a bare-faced attempt to commit a fraud on the intended legatees . In a rage he strode into the clerks' office, taxed me with the interpolation. I assured him I had followed the copy. He demanded the draught for mspection. I had returned it with the fair copy to Mr. Moore, my enior, It was handed to the solicitor. He brought it to me, pointed"], [272, "260 THE RUNAWAY. out the difference between my fraudulent copy and the original draught ; and asked me who had bribed me to rum the firm, and cause future litigation. In vain I protested that I had followed the draught placed in my hands. I had no proof. Stung by his taunts, I replied incautiously that a fictitious draught must have been given to me by my semor to work my rum. There was a general outcry. Mr. Bunce was horrified at the double iniquity of a false accusation made to screen my own guilt. I was expelled the office with ignominy, warned that Mr. Pulteney should know the scoundrel he had trusted and recom mended, and there was a hint that I was probably oMy a tool in Pulteney's hands. This was too much. I could only asseverate my innocence and repeat my former plea, before I was forcibly thrust out. And that was Christmas Eve. I had been led to expect a Christmas-box as a mark of approbation ; I was, instead, turned into the streets penniless \u2014 degraded\u2014 no character to fall back upon \u2014 no means of support lest to me. Smarting with agony, I dashed away from the spot, heedless whither. People screamed and shouted as I crossed the roads, once a cab-horse had its head on my shoulder, and once a policeman dragged me almost from under the wheels of an omnibus by the House of Commons. He gave me a vigorous shake, which brought me to my senses, and asked, \" Do you want to kill yourself, young man ? \" Still, there was no going home. I had no home ! \u2014 my last refuge was shut out from me ! How could I face Mr. Pulteney and tell him ? How meet my struggling landlady without a shilling ? How provide for my own sustenance ? The very doors of the workhouse were closed to me in my masquerade of manhood.. The shops were now alight and brilliant ; drapers, grocers, confectioners, fruiterers, and toymen outrivalled each other m proclaiming what a \" Merry Christmas \" meant to people with money in their purses, and what it might mean to poor creatures like myself, who had missed their way m life, and were without friends, home, or money. Away from the brightness I sped into the darkness of the by-streets and alleys. Night found me by the riverside, as of old ; the riverside, thick with mud, overhung with crazy buildings and sheds, with here and there steps to the bo ats and the water. I hear there is a"], [273, "261 THE RUNAWAY. grand embankment and gardens now, and that I should not know the place if I went. I do not think I knew it then, my mind was in such a haze. In a sort of dazed stupor I sat down on a block of wood or stone, I know not which, nor for how long : it might have been hours. The heavy hand of a policeman on my shoulder \u2014 mine \u2014 roused me ; it was the third time a policeman had touched me that day. I seemed to be haunted by the police ! ' Come, young man, get up. You must move on. The tide is coming up, you will get your death if you stop here. Move on.' Mechanically I obeyed, turning landwards ; but the water, on which a full moon was shmmg, seemed to have a strange fascination for me, and I again found myself by the waterside, watching the ripples shimmering like silver m a line of light. I had heard people in the busy streets salute each other with ' Merry CMistmas ! ' heard two fellows hauling in a barge hail the occupants of a passmg boat with the same greeting, ' Merry Christmas ! ' I had wished father, mother, brother, sister, 'Merry Christmas' just twelve months ago, and what a Christmas I had made it for them, and for myself! And now, where was I to spend the Christmas that was coming ? In the streets, the workhouse, or a prison ? Behind the horrid wall which had bounded my horizon so long ? I shuddered as I recalled the touch of the policeman. ' Young .man,' he had said. What if I were taken up on suspicion for loitering about ? Would not my whole story be sent flying tMough the land on paper wings \u2014 a story of shameful disguise and failure ? Nay, that should not be ! They might carry me to a dead-house if they would, but I should be buried as one unknown, and save the name I had borne from farther dishonour. A cold bath was better than the cold streets or stone walls and disgrace. ' May God forgive me ! ' As the cry broke from my lips I bad flung myself from a wharf into the stream. I must have shrieked ere the water went over me and into my ears and nose and mouth, as I went down with a flash as of Me in my eyes ; came up strugglmg, only to be sent swirling on with the retreating tide, and then was down again ; now up, fighting with the Thames for the life I had madly flung away \u2014 all my past years crowdmg mto a moment of gurgling time \u2014 and then there came \u2014 oblivion !

They rested on their oars for a moment, then pulled where there was an eddy right in the line of moonlight ; and as a dark head and white face came to the surface, a strong arm clutched the collar of a man's coat, and held the body up till another pair of arms came to his assistance, and at the risk of swamping the boat, tugged the drowning wretch on board. A shout went out over the still water from a pair of lusty lungs, as the wet form was laid in the bottom of the boat. The steersman raised the black head and shoulders against his knee, cleansed the mouth and nostrils from blood and slime, to let water out and give air, then loosed collar and neckcloth. Jnst then, in answer to their prolonged shouts, another boat shot into the light, filled with river police. I seemed fated \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 to fall into the hands of the police that night. One of the men boarded the boat, took Ms place at an oar, and in a few* moments the two boats were alongside the floating station on the Thames. Only by hearsay can I tell how I was brought back to life, or how my preservers were taken by surprise when my black beard came away in a policeman's hand, and the baring of my chest, to promote respiration, told that a desperate woman demanded their care, and not a fellow-man. But it needed no hearsay to tell how the sturdy young miller, who had first clutched me by the collar, was affected.\" \"Aye,\" interrupted the miller, \" I thought them river police took it all mighty coolly ; but I suppose it's their calling, and they get used to such sights ! But go on, wife.\" \" My first remembrance was of a pitying face looking clown upon me, and a strange voice saying, ' She's coming to !' mingled with the sound of a striking clock and the pealing of bells ; as, soon aster, recollection dawned upon me, and a sense of discovery and shame, and I wished they had lest me in the river to drown. I believe I said so with returning speech, for a cheery voice said, ' Nay, nay, my lass ; there's better things in store tor thee than drowning. Hark to them bells!

' Much more he said to comfort me ; and at length tears found their way mto my unweepmg eyes, and I think they did me good. All that day, Christmas Day, and all the next night I remained in the hands of the police ; to be brought up the next morning with a hideous crew of drunken men and woman, before a magistrate at Westminster, and there I \u2014 Johanna Ainsworth, the daughter of honourable parents \u2014 stood like a common criminal in the dock, charged with the double offence of attempted suicide and wearing man's apparel. And then all my miserable story came out. I had lest home where girls were an encumbrance, hoping as a man to get man's work and man's wages, and help those I lest behind. After long failure, I had obtained a situation \u2014 how, I did not say. Had gained the ill-will of the other clerks because I stuck at my desk. A trap had been laid for me, ora joke played off, which brought upon me the displeasure of my master. He had turned me off, without investigation, without money, or character, and in my desperation I had flung myself into the river. But I refused to give my name; \u2014 well, they might imprison me ; I might have brought misery upon my friends \u2014 I could not add disgrace. ' Bravely said, my lass ! ' whispered a voice at my elbow. 'But thmk again. A friend might serve you if your own silence does not stand in the way.' A doleful shake of the head was my only answer to the miller, who was there as a witness.\" \" Aye,\" put in the miller, \" and to see fair play.\" The magistrate was about to remand me for inquiry, when someone rose and addressed him. It was Mr. Bunce, and at his side was Mr. Pulteney. ' I know the prisoner as John Ainsworth,' proclaimed the former. ' Under that name I engaged him as a copying-clerk ; and dismissed him summarily, and, I fear, wrongfully.' Mr. Pulteney had feared something when I did not return home as usual. Had looked up his friend Bunce, set inquiry on foot, and was there to testify somewhat in my favour. Nevertheless, I was likely to be committed to gaol as an offender, because I could not be allowed to go at large in male attire, and I had neither feminine garments nor the means to procure them. The miller stepped forth."], [276, "264 THE RUNAWAY. ' Your worship,' said he, ' I'm a bad hand at accounts ; if so be you will have mercy on that poor misguided creature, and let her off, she can come to my mill and keep mj* books, and maybe help the old mother to keep all straight till she can better herself. And I'll pay her a fair wage.' ' Are you willing '? ' questioned the magistrate. Willing, boys, I was thankful, and said so. ' But your dress ? ' from the Bench. - If there be a woman in court your worship can send with me shopping, I'll soon set that right,\" said the miller sturdily. It was set right, I was clad as a woman should be, and then I was allowed to depart, not without a lecture from the Bench on the course I had taken. My new master, bidding his two friends have the boat m readiness at Blackfriars Pier, called a cab, and, together with Mr. Pulteney, we took Mrs. Moss by surprise. My arrears of rent were paid, and my tale told whilst I was gathering my traps into Edgar's carpet-bag, leaving my few chattels behmd as a legacy. No one was more astonished than my new master's mother when her son entered the mill with a young woman, and told her he had brought her a book-keeper ! I think she had a notion he had been drinking, as he had not been home on Christmas Day, or that he had lost his senses. But when he told all my story, and told it pitifully, she said, ' Poor lass ! ' and coming to remove my bonnet, dropped a tear as well as a kiss on my forehead, and I knew I had once more found a home. I kept the miller's books, and I helped the good mother to keep the house and clothes in order, and at their entreaty com municated with my relatives. It was some time before an answer came back, and when it did, it almost broke my heart. My mother had never recovered the shock of my flight, but filled with self-reproach had died in less than two months. There had been a removal to a still cheaper neighbourhood, and Madge, impressing all the girls into her service, had turned her talent for dressmaking to good account. They had a fair business, and were thriving. Ben was steady, and had been promoted. Father had never been quite himself since he lost his Johanna. Whether mother or ruyself was meant, the reproach to me was none the less severe. It was some con solation to know myself forgiven.

Miss Murray heaved a deep sigh, as she said, \" I'm afraid I, too, have followed a Will-o-the-wisp. Even if I had not been robbed, I fear I should have sunk under such difficulties as you had to encounter. It was a hasty and inconsiderate step, and I am afraid I was most in the wrong after all. And what would have been my end if your good husband had not found me, I shudder to think. In my utter wretchedness 1 had begun to wonder how far I was from the river, and whether I had better not end it all there.

If I went back, aunt would never forgive me, or John either.\" \" We'll talk that over inthemornmg,\" said the miller. \" It's time w'e were all abed now.\" And with grateful thanks the young lady went to her rude pallet, for the first time in her life conscious what it meant to be homeless and shelterless. If possible, the next day was more stormy and tempestuous than the previous one had been, but rough as it was, the miller had mounted Ms horse and set off to find Mrs. Clifford's abode at Sonnmg. He and his wife had held a consultation over their early breaMast, and had decided it was best to see the aunt and smooth the way for the runaway's return. Worn out with fatigue and exposure, the girl overslept herself. She came down at ten o'clock to apologise, but feverish, and full of excited questioning what would become of herself. She was hungry, but could scarcely choke a breakfast down. She heard the clack of the mill, and supposed the miller was at work. The rain was pouring in torrents. The river rushed over the weir with an awful sound in her ears. Her head seemed ready to split. Where should she go ? What should she do ? Mrs. Dufton bade her \" lie down on the old sofa, she was fit for"], [278, "266 THE RUNAWAY. nothing else, and that was not a day to turn a dog out, let alone a wilful lass.\" Dinner time came, but no miller, and she wondered at that ; but about three o'clock there was a sound of wheels at the back of the mill. Then came in the miller, and with him a stately old lady and a fine young man, her son, summoned from the north by telegram when his cousin was missed. There was \u2014 thanks to the good miller \u2014 forgiveness for the runaway, and more than forgiveness. Mrs. Clifford was willing at last to sanction the correspondence of her niece with her son, but she would have no secrecy, and no running away. \" No more running away, aunt. I have had a hard lesson.\" But she very nearly ran away altogether before the lesson was spelled out ; for fever followed the excitement and exposure, and her delhous illness brought as much sorrow to her friends as her rash flight had done. She has been quite another girl since her recovery, and her aunt says she has no longer any fear of her making a good wife to John, since she learned to value home and friends. But she says the lesson taught by the robbers, the wind, and the rain, hunger and weariness, might have been lost had it not been enforced by the story of the miller's wife, who had run away with a higher motive, and yet repented it as a wrong towards others, a want of faith m God."], [279, "THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. CHAPTER I. \"If I were you, Tessy, I should have my wedding-dress made by Madame Drapeau, and not by a miserable nobody of a dress maker, who is as likely to spoil it as not,\" was the advice of Miss Ethel Minton to her cousin Theresa Trevor, whose bridesmaid she was about to be. The damsel of eighteen summers who thus advised the bride elect, aged twenty-one, dropped the fold of creamy satin offered for her inspection, and as she spoke took a well-satisfied survey of her own faultlessly-fitting winter costume in the looking-glass panel of Miss Trevor's handsome wardrobe, in which a bright fire shone and flamed, as if defying the sharp frost to enter there. Theresa saw the movement and smiling, said, \" Yet, Ethel, that blue serge fits you admirably. I admit Madame Drapeau's skill. Still, can you point to any dress of mine which is not m good taste and style ? and I have no dressmaker but Miss Nelson.\" \" Well, no, I can't say that I can,\" answered Ethel with some little hesitation. \" But then, you know, a weddmg-dress is not to be classed with your ordinary attire. It is preposterous to think of trusting that splendid silk Monsieur Delcroix has brought \u2014 a silk which it is not possible to match in England \u2014 to a milliner in a poky room in a back street. I should be sorry to consign my dress to her,\" and up went her shoulders in a shrug, and the tip of her nose in a curl of ineffable contempt and. disdain. \"Very likely,\" assented Theresa Trevor, expressively, as she calmly readjusted the folds of a rich ivory-white brocade silk, of minute and elaborate design, which lay in tissue paper on a dainty cretonne ottoman ; whilst her voluble companion ran on \u2014 \" But who is this Miss Nelson ? And who recommended her ? Oh ! did you not once say it was Charlie Driffield ? \" For some reason or other the blood mounted to Theresa Trevor's temples, and she seemed to choke overpowering emotion down before she answered, soberly, \"Ethel, dear, this Miss Nelson, whom you seem to despise on"], [280, "268 THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. account of her calling, was as delicately reared and as well brought up as you or I, if not better.

Besides, my dear, there w*as an invalid mother, and a younger brother and sister to be cared for as well as herself. She had previously taken lessons in dressmaking for home use, and resolved to turn them to account.

I forgot that Charlie Driffield was a forbidden topic. Nay, I thought \u2014 pardon me \u2014 I thought \u2014 as you were about to be married you had for gotten \" A tap at the door put a stop to the conversation. A neatly dressed maid was there to say, \" Please, miss, the dressmaker is below.\" The voice was sufficiently composed which said, \" Show Miss Nelson upstairs to this room, it is warmer here than below. And let a cup of hot tea be sent up immediately, and a little cake ; she will be half-frozen.\" But Ethel Minton knew her cousin too well to mistake con straint for composure. Not sorry for the interruption, she had seated herself comfortably by tho fire in the easiest of easy chairs, with a half-shivery glance at the frost-rimmed trees outside, but she rose involuntarily as the dressmaker entered the well-appointed, not to say luxurious, dressing-room. She saw before her, not the vulgar creature of her imagination, but a slim, lady-like girl in a dark ulster \u2014 pale and benumbed with the cold, it is true, yet whose inclination of the head on entering was graceful, in spite of the large parcel she carried ; and she could not have numbered more than twenty-three years. It was not so much an instinctive sense of propriety as a new born deference to the lady in the dressmaker which caused her to say, \" I think I had better go downstairs to aunt.\" \"Nay, Ethel,\" interposed the bride-elect, \"you must see what Miss Nelson has in her parcel ; \" and, turning to the dressmaker, \" You must know, Miss Nelson, that my cousin, Miss Minton,"], [281, "THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. 269 is a devotee of fashion, a very oracle of the toilette. Her counsel will be invaluable.\" The dressmaker smiled as she shook a dinner-dress of the richest ruby free from the brown paper. \" You must not let my cousin make you nervous, Miss Nelson, though I own I have a horror of an ill-made, ill-fitting garment,\" put M Ethel, affably. \" Oh ! what a charming costume ! \" she broke forth again, clasping her hands in ecstasy as a shimmer of silk and poplin met her view, and she was forced to admit that Madam Drapeau could have done no better. After that, she could bear with more complacence that the Lyons brocade for the wedding-dress should be consigned to the same hands. But she watched and listened both to Theresa and Miss Nelson, whilst the latter sipped her tea, for some clue to the puzzle why this humble dressmaker was in such evident favour. And when the measuring and fitting were over, she took upon herself to impress on her the extreme necessity for extra care, since, m case of any unlucky slip, the silk was not to be matched in England, having come fresh from Messieurs Delcroix's manufactory in Lyons. \" I don't like the way that dressmaker smiles,\" she began, when Miss Nelson had gone out agam into the cold, carrying with her a large parcel of materials. \" She looked as if she did not believe me when I said the silk was not to be matched, and came direct from the Lyons manufactory ! \"Don't be prejudiced, my dear,\" said the other, \"Madame Drapeau has always an unmeaning smile upon her face, but I never heard you take exception to that.\" Theresa Trevor was an only child. Her father, a retired city merchant, stM occupied the roomy, old-fashioned, red-brick house on the Chelsea border of Kensington, which took its name from an ancient mulberry-tree in the garden, where his father had lived before him. He had married late in life, and when 1880 showed its frosty face was a grey-haired man, who pottered about his garden and greenhouse, grumbled at the severity of the weather, which had played sad havoc with his ivy and other evergreens the wmter before ; inveighed agamst the array of stone and stuccoed villas and mansions which sprang up and elbowed Mm so closely ; read the Times and Share List, and assisted the partner of bis joys and sorrows in the chief business of her life \u2014 the spoihng of their daughter. A child without brothers or sisters is apt to be so spoiled, especially when born unto middle-aged parents, and Theresa was no exception. She was beautiful and accomplished, and had a"], [282, "270 THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. good heart, but she was not an angel, and they thought her one. She had no faults in theh eyes. Among their city friends might be counted Driffield the banker and his wife ; and the banker's home being no farther away than Cromwell -road, it naturally followed that Theresa should be on intimate terms with the banker's daughters, and the son. It was this son Charles, a fine specimen of the Anglo-Saxon race, who had bespoken Theresa Trevor's sympathy for the Nelsons in their fall from competence to poverty, and the readiness with which she responded was due as much to her own good feeling as to the voice of the pleader. And yet there was no voice which had so much music in her ears, no form with such manly beauty in her eyes, no human being who coMd set her pulses dancmg to the same tune, no human being in such thorough accord with herself, yet leading her beyond herself to something higher and nobler. Their mutual attachment was a recognised fact, and the elders anticipated a speedy union of the two families, w*hen, without any premonition, the two quarrelled and parted, with the ex pressed determination \" never to see the other's face again.\" Miss Trevor was proud ; Mr. Charles Driffield was proud also. He expected she would show signs of concession : she neither expected it from him nor dreamed of it for herself. She had forbidden the utterance of his name in her presence ; yet she missed the familiar word, missed the sound of his footfall, the echo of his voice, the touch of his warm hand, the kiss upon her lips ; aye, and the unuttered reproof of his steadfast eyes, when little faults, unseen by her fond parents, gave passing pain to him. He was the only one who ever found a flaw in her, or the oMy one who owned it ; and though they had quarrelled over it, she would rather have had his thoughtful censure than the unqualified adulation of others \u2014 that is, now the mischief was done, and repentance had brought common sense into play. The true heart and sincere lip were missed indeed. Theresa saw the anxious eyes of father and mother following her about the house, and she knew* \u2014 for her glass told her \u2014 that she was growing paler and thinner. In her pride of heart she dreaded lest the change should be remarked and talked about, and Charlie Driffield should think she was \" pining for him.\" To avoid this she proposed a summer tour on the Continent ; and as no proposal of hers met with long opposition, and the phy sician they called in thought a change might be beneficial, the thoroughly English father and mother relinquished their home"], [283, "THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. 271 comforts, and the Chelsea house was resigned, with a sigh, to the care of servants. The}* were away four months. When they returned there was a handsome, black-moustached foreigner in their train, whom they introduced as Monsieur Eugene Delcroix. A slight service rendered to Mr. Trevor in an altercation with guides at Chamouni had served for an mtroduction, and the discovery that the polite stranger was the junior partner in the well-known Lyons silk house of \" Delcroix et Neveu\" placed him on a friendly footing at once, Erasmus Trevor having dealt extensively with the noted firm previously to his retirement from business in 1878. Monsieur Delcroix, as he said, was \" travelling as much for health as pleasure, having overtaxed himself with close attention to business during the temporary absence of his honoured uncle in London the previous season.\" This visit of the elder Delcroix was well remembered by the Trevors, he havmg dined at Mulberry House with them during his stay ; and that fortuitous meeting with the younger Delcroix was hailed by Erasmus Trevor as a stroke of good fortune. The merchant could not forget old associations ; it was a delight to be able to talk over commercial matters in a foreign land. Then, notwithstanding his learned name, he was no linguist : his French w*ould not have passed muster even at \" Stratford-atte-ye-Bowe.\" The advent of an apt translator was something to rejoice over. The young gentleman \u2014 he was not more than twenty-seven \u2014 protested the good fortune was all on his side, his bows to the ladies and his glances towards Theresa giving significance to his speech. They met, parted, met again at other points of the route, and whensoever they thus met Monsieur Decroix seemed most naturally to attach himself to their party, and that without the slightest appearance of intrusion, he being evidently regarded by all three as an acquisition. Without obtruding his society or his attentions, he made him self necessary not only to the elders, but to Theresa. She had set forth with the resolute determination to forget Charles Driffield. Possibly she did forget him in the society of the handsome and attentive Frenchman. At all events she ended by accepting as a substitute for the old lover who \" loved not her faults, but, in spite of them, her,\" this Eugene Delcroix, who had followed them to Paris, and whose devotion was as the adoration paid to a saint or an angel."], [284, "272 THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. He accompanied them to London, remained a week or two , and having pressed for an early marriage, went back, as he said, to Lyons to prepare for the reception of his bride, returmng only in time for the Christmas festivities at Mulberry House, from which, for the first time in many years, the Driffields were conspicuously absent. The fascinating Frenchman, however, did Ms best to Ml up the blank ; his English was good if not fluent ; he was well read, conversible, could discuss \" tariffs \" and \" exchanges \" with City men ; smile and show his white teeth, with matrons and misses, and make himself generally agreeable. He was a fair musician, and sang sentimental songs with a fine tenor voice. Erasmus Trevor admitted that he would \"much have preferred Charlie Driffield as a son-in-law ;\" yet he said \" Tessy's happiness was before all other considerations,\" and he was really proud of an alliance with the celebrated house of Delcroix, and mtroduced the nephew to his friends with much effusion. At Mulberry House all was bustle and preparation; tears and smiles alternated on the pleasant face of Mrs. Trevor, as presents came trooping in for the bride, and the bridegroom clasped his hands and shrugged his shoulders in ecstatic admiration of each rich gist. One package, closely sealed with a well-known monogram, Theresa carried to her own room, and it was seen no more. Nor did she put in an appearance in the drawmg-room the rest of the evening ; she \" had a headache,\" she said. And no doubt she had, for the letter-cases, cigar-cases, smoking-caps and other trifles worked by her own hands for Charlie Driffield had all come back to her, and with them a locket containing her own portrait and a shining brown curl ; and she sobbed over them in an agony of pain, as if her very heart would break. In that hour a chill seemed to take possession of her frame, and the intense cold was made responsible. She did not appear at the breaMast table in the morning, her \"head still ached so terribly ;\" and when she did descend to the morning-room, palpably shrank from the effusive greetings of her promised bridegroom, whose surprise and concern were as perceptible. All that day and the next her manner was strained and incomprehensible. Now and again she shook and sMvered as with an ague, though a fleecy scarf was wrapped around her shoulders, and fires were blazing in every room. The intense frost born with 1881 had burst the household waterpipes, and the staircase, newly carpeted for the auspicious occasion at hand, had been deluged. In the immediate excite-"], [285, "THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. 273 ment and confusion Theresa's strangeness might have passed unnoticed but for Eugene's anxiety. Bending over her with the most tender entreaties, he urged her to see a doctor. She was barely civil in her replies. \" Oh, go away, it is oMy the bitter weather, I shall be better soon.\" \" But, my dear Theresa, suppose \" \" Now, do be quiet, Eugene ! I tell you it is only the cold.\" If it was only ilie cold it made her irritable and techy to the last degree, and to no one more so than her lover. He was beginning to fear that the wedding might have to be deferred, and his anxiety mcreased as the hours went by without effecting a change. Surely there was not a secret longing m her breast for any such contingency ? If there was, and she repented the step she was taking, there was yet time to retreat ; time to cry peccavi and seek pardon alike from the old lover and the new. Time ? there was time for pride to battle with repentance, and drive reflection from the field. She was herself again. Gracious to Eugene, affectionate to Ethel, whom she had decidedly snubbed ; chatty with her father, and interested in the tribulation of her mother, who declared there would be \" scarcely time to put things to rights before the wedding.\" \"Put things to rights!\" The words shaped a crude idea into a fiery sword, that smote, and smote heavily, where it was not aimed. Theresa would have fled to her own room once more, but the staircase was yet streaming with a thin cascade, and overhead globules of water floated on the ceiling, met, and meeting, dropped below in heavy rain on venturous heads ; whilst servants with mop-rags and pails strove to prevent further damage. \" Put things to rights ! \" She went back to her lounge by the fire, more than ever conscious there was something wrong. Oh ! that she could \" put things to rights ! \" Again she shivered. Again Eugene \u2014 watchful Eugene \u2014 drew near, and begged she would see a physician, and again was he rebuffed. Ethel, to the utter destruction of her elegant morning toilette, had gone to the assistance of her aunt. Mr. Trevor had been out more than an hour in quest of a plumber, the messenger sent having come back without one, so many people were in like plight, and plumbers are not to be had at every street corner when the demand is so universal. He was seen to cross the lawn with a workman at his heels with a ready basket of tools slung over his shoulder, and was comfortably saying, \" I knew I T"], [286, "274 THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. could find a man if I went myself,\" when M. Eugene stepped out, drew him aside, and expressed an opinion that a doctor was as much a necessity as a plumber. \" Eh ! What ! Tessy ill \u2014 shivering agam ! It's all this horrible frost ! Won't see a doctor ? Won't she? Wait.\" And the active old gentleman, leaving the plumber to his devices, was off again, muffled up to the chin, and neither called for horse nor carriage. Miss Trevor was brought face to face with the doctor unex pectedly and against her will. \"Nothing serious the matter,\" was his verdict. \" Just a little feverish. Natural excitement consequent on the approachmg marriage \u2014 separation from parents, and so forth,\" and the wise man went, and a bottled sedative came. All her pride had been called up to baffle the keen eyes of the doctor, but she was glad to accept Ms medicine as an excuse to retire to bed. \" I leave Ethel to entertam you,\" she said to her lover with a feeble smile as she went. \" And don't get up, Tessy, till Miss Nelson comes to-morrow with your wedding-dress. That will be sure to do you good,\" cried Ethel, to whom a wedding-dress seemed a panacea for all ills. \" But fancy Miss Nelson or anyone else sitting still and stitching all day over m weather like this ! The poor girl's fingers must be cramped with cold. I should not like to earn my living either with my needle or my pen. Should you, Monsieur Delcroix? \" Eugene Delcroix was holding the door open for his beloved to pass out ; one of her hands rested in his. She felt him start perceptibly as thus addressed, and saw a flush cross Ms dark face, but his lips broke mto a smile across Ms white teeth, and he answered with a shrug, \" Mais, 71011, Madlle. Minton!\" He had begun to count the hours, he said. And so did Theresa. And she began to think of the girl stitching at her dress with benumbed fingers ; and to speculate whether it really would be ready m time. It was to be brought home on the morrow, Tuesday, the 18th. Only suppose any accident should happen to it 1 Suppose it were not to be brought home ! They surely would not expect her to be married without it ! Would they?"], [287, "THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. 275 CHAPTER H. Dreams are as fantastic as intangible and evanescent. Rarely do they present the actual and real, else Theresa Trevor's dreams might have carried her into Miss Nelson's work-room in Belvedere Crescent, and she might have wakened with a problem to perplex her. She had never set her living foot on the pavement of Belvedere Crescent. She had heard that it swept its senii-circle out of the Belvedere-road, uncomfortably near the Thames, on the Surrey side, and that Miss Nelson had made her abode there when her mother was under surgical treatment in St. Thomas's Hospital ; and her case being long and tedious, there they were likely to remain, though she was no longer an inmate of the hospital, but only an occasional attendant, approaching convalescence. It was only ot late she had heard thus much, her sympathj' having quickened considerably since she herself began to suffer. She had previously heard Miss Nelson say that though the Crescent was not in a fashionable quarter, and though it was hemmed in by the high walls of wharf-warehouses and manufactories, it was in itself quiet, clean, and respectable, and that although the house they occupied was one of the smallest, having only two floors, they had no basement, and were enabled to keep it wholly to themselves without lodgers \u2014 a sine qua non to the invalid mother. And with respect to her business, her customers were of a class who sent for her, and knew Belvedere Crescent only by its name. Thanks to Mr. Charles Driffield and his sisters, she had now a good connection, and they were thinking of removing as soon as Mrs. Nelson ceased to attend the hospital. All this Theresa had heard ; but she had never troubled herself to recognise Miss Nelson apart from her business, or to call on the invalid, though she was a clergyman's widow, and a lady. She had given the former work, had paid her well and promptly, had recommended her to others, and treated her with invariable kindness and courtesy ; but it was as the dressmaker, who suited her better, and charged her less than the more celebrated West- end modiste ; not as one who, by birth, position, and education, had been equal to herself, whose noble struggles against adverse fortune and whose sacrifices for others called for respect and generous sympathy. It was the evident lack of this sympathetic essence in her dealings with Miss Nelson which had . called forth a gentle suggestion from Charles Driffield, and led to their final rupture."], [288, "276 THERESA TREVOR'S -WEDDING DRESS. \"I am not disposed to be lectured on my duties,\" she had1 said. \" And I am not disposed to take a wife who does not know what her womanly duties are, without lecturing,\" said he. \" Then you had better take someone else, Mr. Driffield,\" she had answered haughtily. \" I hope I shall never see you here again ! \" She shed a flood of tears when he was gone, and she half owned to herself that he was right ; but it was not until long after she found that he was not likely to return that she took herself to task in earnest. That she had not dismissed the unconscious dressmaker when she dismissed her lover told in Theresa's favour. Nay, she had. taken his remonstrance to heart, and shown more womaffly interest in the less fortunate being who served her so well. But she never approached Belvedere Crescent. She would not for any consideration have had Charles Driffield suspect that Ms suggestions had been anything to her. And so she bad never seen, and her dreams were not likely to show, that front room on the ground floor, a work-room. during the week, a parlour on the Sabbath, when the sewing machine under the window kept rest and silence under its polished mahogany hood and a cover, handsome m some byegone day, hid the ugly scores and scratches made in the top of the old dimng-table which did duty as a work-table. But when Theresa Trevor lay down to rest on that Wednesday evening, leaving Ethel Minton to solace her disconsolate and restless betrothed, that uncovered work-table was heaped with the creamy Lyons silk, rich satin, and costly lace, through which Miss Nelson's scissors were sent with no uncertain hand. Lit by the same tall paraffin lamp, her younger sister Miriam, a girl of eighteen, with weary feet pressed the treadles of the whirling and whirrmg sewing-machine, and guided, with ready eye and. finger, long strips of the delicate material in theh course under the magic needle. And suspended on a tall pole, on a millmer's wire frame m a corner, out of the way of passing skirts, hung a newly-finished robe, of texture like unto that upon the table, its whiteness relieved by touches of rich ruby plush. There was an empty chair on one side the hearth, where a fire, large as the small grate would permit, blazed cheerily, and kept warm a brown earthenware tea-pot on the hob ; and on the opposite side, closely wrapped in a thick woollen shawl, and leaning back in an American easy chair, sat a ladylike woman,"], [289, "THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. 277 whose cap betokened her widowhood, and on whose face the lines \u2022of care and pam had anticipated those of age, for she was barely fifty- She was saying, \" Ambrose is late. I wonder what ean have detained Mm ? \" when a brisk step on the pavement, and a knock at the door, announced the coming of the son for whom the tea pot and a tray on a small side-table were waiting. He came into the room rubbing his chilled hands together, and answering questions as he came. \" Cold ? I should think it was ! Our ink has almost frozen in our pens at the Bank, and the Thames is all ice. I am too cold even to Mss you at present, mother ! Late ? Yes, I have been \u2022engaged on some rather particular business.\" The little table was set in a recess by the fire-place. As he seated himself m the chair opposite to his mother, his eye fell on the dress m the extreme corner. The hand stretched out to help himself to the tea-pot stopped midway. \" Ah ! I see you have finished Miss Driffield's dress. It looks first-rate. I wonder what Miss Trevor would thmk if she saw it ? \" and he turned to his tea. \" I know what /thought when that fashionable cousin of hers said the wedding-dress silk came direct from the manufactory at Lyons, and could not be matched if I spoiled it. It was just one \u2022of those fibs young ladies slip out so readily, to make themselves and their belongmgs of importance. I was only surprised Miss Trevor did not contradict her,\" was the answer of Miss Nelson, .as she folded up the long strips of silk fresh from the machme, and added, turning to her sister, \" Here, Miriam, run off to the kilter's and see it done wMle you stay, and without spot or blemish.\" \"Didn't contradict it,\" mused the young man, as he drank his tea and lessened the slices of toast crisped with waiting before the fire ; then, as the door closed on Miriam, asked abruptly, \" Do you think they both believed what they said ? \" \" Well, really, Ambrose, that never occurred to me !\" answered his sister, pausing for an mstant, with a pm half-way through the trimming she was adjusting ; \" but they certaiMy said it was a present from Monsieur Delcroix.\" \" Did they ? That adds to the perplexity,\" he murmured thoughtfully. \"I say, Sis,\" he said after awhile, \"I wish you would let me have those two tab-ends, I think you call them, to-morrow, to show to Mr. Charles. I mean the ends of silk with the manufacturer's mark on them,\" he added. His sister opened her eyes. \"What for, Ambrose? Pray, \u2022don't make any mischief.'*"], [290, "278 THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. \" Never mind what for, Rachel. I'll not make any mischief I want to prevent it. You'd better give them me before Miriam comes back,\" said he, \" and you need not mention it.\" \" But why not ?\" asked sister and mother in a breath. \" And what mischief do you want to prevent ?\" \" Never you mind ; just give me the tabs. You must trust my discretion, of which silence is a proof.\" And he held out his hand for them. After some little hesitation the tab-ends were handed over to him, and were duly labelled for distinction, and soon after Miriam came in, blue with cold, to beat her hands and stamp her feet to warm them. \" Oh, dear, dear ! I wish this long sharp frost would go. We shall want a good fire if we are to sit up to-night. and I don't see however we can get it done unless we do.\" \" Not one moment after midnight,\" said the brother, decidedly. \"If Rachel be compelled to stram her eyes, and cramp her fingers, I will stay up and keep her awake, and attend to the Me, but you, Miriam, march to bed.\" And as the clock struck twelve, to bed she went. The mother had been in bed hours before. It was no unusual thing for Ambrose to sit up and read to his sister when so pressed with work ; but that night, when Miriam was out of the way, he began to question Rachel about the bridegroom, and was so anxious to know if she had seen this Monsieur Eugene Delcroix, and what he was like, and how he dressed, that the hours flew almost as fast as her fingers. She was puzzled to know why he was so uncommoffly curious,. and why he enjoined her to say notMng when she took the dress home ; but he gave offly the unsatisfactory answer, ' ' Miss Trevor might think Mr. Charles had set me on to ask, and he would not like that.\" Breakfast was over ; Ambrose Nelson off to the bank, carrymg with him in his head, more than the fag-ends of silk in his pocket, though he took special care of them. Rachel was busied putting the finishing touches to the delicate bridal robe. Miriam, having coaxed the reluctant workroom Me to burn, looking towards the window, cried out, \" I declare if it isn't snowing ! It's no use dressing, mother, to go to the hospital to-day if it snows. Well, it's as fine and blows about just like dust ! Perhaps it will soon be over.\" \"I'm afraid not,\" suggested Rachel. \"I've heard father say that the snow in Russia is fine as dust, yet it covers the road way and blocks up doorways in an mcredibly short space of tiine,."], [291, "THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. 279 and its minute crystals sting the face like needle-points, and it is more persistent than when it falls in great flakes like feathers. I think mother had better have a fire m her room, and not come downstairs to-day, it is so cold.\" Half-an-hour later, Miriam was at the front door. She came back in wonderment. \" Why, Rachel dear, the snow is heaped up on the mat in the passage. I coMd scarcely open the door. It must have sifted underneath most mysteriously. And it does so sting the face if you look out ; and it lies thick in the road ; and only look at that blank wall opposite, the bricks have a tufted coat ! I never saw anything like this before. However mil you get to Chelsea with that dress ? \" \" Oh, there'll be no difficMty about that. I can take the tram at Westminster Bridge. I am neither sugar nor salt, my dear, and people who have to earn their livmg cannot stand at trifles. My boots are strong, and my ulster thick. I am more concerned about the dress. Miss Trevor must have it to-day. You know the weddmg is on Thursday.\" \" I know that Rachel Nelson is a brave girl, and a dear, good sister. It often puzzles me how you can stitch away and contrive other people's weddmg-robes, and talk so composedly of other people's weddings with that dress of your own folded up and lymg by upstairs never to be worn at all. It seems to me as if your life was folded up m it ; and I never move the locked-up box for sweepmg but I thMk of the sacrifice you made for us all ;\" and she laid her head on her sister's shoulder m a lovmg caress which endangered a dainty fold of lace on the dress m hand. \"My dear Miriam,\" said Rachel, with anattempt at lightness, \" it was quite a question of arithmetic. TMee lives agamst one. I could not have bought wealth and happiness at such a price. Let us be thankful I was not married when the crash came. I might have found my gold tinsel. But, dear me ! how the snow does fall ! It is like a cloud.\" And so the subject was turned. But Mhiam had showered upon her memories, which fell silently and chilly as the snow without ; only the foes of love and duty kept her heart warm. And still the snow fell, and the wild wind whirled and eddied the white impalpable powder in through keyholes, chinks, and crevices until it lay heaped round the feet of the sewmg-machine and on the window frame, and in the passage ; and the people M the road seemed to fight with the cloud. Rachel had put the last sprig of orange-blossom on the train skirt, and Miriam stood by with a light box to receive it, when a"], [292, "280 THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. great cry and a tramp of runnmg feet came to them from the Belvedere-road, and white-faced men rushed past as if makmg the \u2022circuit of the Crescent with the warning shout, \"The tide! the tide ! The high tide is upon us ! \" Following close upon theh feet, and lickmg up the pure snow with its foul tongue, came the muddy overflow of the Thames, crawling over the roadway and the pavement, and now stealmg in under the ill-fitting doors, over the oilcloth, on to the carpet. \" Quick, Miriam, quick ! Miss Driffield's dress ! Upstairs, quick ! \" and like a lightmng flash, Miriam had snatched the ball dress from the stand and followed her sister up the stairs with the damty robe. \" Thank God ! they are safe ! \" cried Rachel, earnestly, as she laid the box down. \" It would rum us to replace them if they were spoiled. The tide is up, mother, as it was last year, and now flooding the room below. But don't be alarmed, mother, it may only spoil the carpet. Mhiam and I will take care nothing else is injured. It will not rise far above our step. It is the poor people who live m the basements at the other end of the Crescent who will suffer. What will become of them ? \" She might well ask that. Down through the area railings the water had gone sweeping and surging, givmg the inmates barely time to fly for theh fives. Even the plank barriers along some of the rails served only to retard the invader for a brief space ; over went the waters loaded with ice, that beat like hammers upon windows and doors. What were wood and glass against Father Thames m his might ? Rachel herself had miscalculated. The flood of the previous year had spared them, barely rismg above the step at theh front door ; but now it filled the passage like a brook, and was almost on a level with the first stair when she and her sister went down. Bravely tucking up their skirts, nothing daunted, offly fearful of alarmmg the mother in bed, they waded through the icy water Mtent on bearing fragile and perishable articles to safer places. To their dismay the ice was thumping against the outer door, and the lock threatened to give way. Hauling, tugging, carrying, these two girls plunged tMough the rismg water, upstairs and down, bearing with them first the property of others, then their own more perishable goods, com pelled to leave chairs and tables behind in that sea of mud, and beat a retreat upstairs to remove wet clothing, and comfort the distressed parent, whose very helplessness made her liable to fears and terrors. It was fortunate for them their low step did raise their house"], [293, "THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. 281 -above the level of the street, and a bolt shot mto the socket by Miriam at the outset had strengthened the door ; but from the window IooMng right or left they could see only a surgmg stream, tMough which men were wading to the rescue of women and children in peril of their lives, as could be told by their shouting to each other. In front offly a high blank wall frowned upon them through the continuous mist of fallmg snow ; but they were con scious their own loss and damage was as nothing compared to the losses of others in the Belvedere-road, seeing that it lay between them and the turbulent river. On Rachel's mind Miss Trevor's wedding-dress lay heavily. The day was speedmg. Wading barefoot, they had brought fuel \u25a0and food from below, though the former was wet ; but there was no wadmg through the flooded streets to carry home the promised and important garment. It was four o'clock before the tide began to turn, and then she counted the hours, hoping that Ambrose would come by the time the streets were passable, and help her to the station. But no Ambrose came, though the water in kitchen and parlour had found an outlet, and left behind offly a deposit of mud and slime, and from the very roadway the flood was retreating in a sullen stream. In spite of remonstrance Rachel Nelson put on her boots and ulster about half-past seven, determmed to keep her word, though the snow was still falling and the roads a mass of mud. Ambrose met her at the corner of the street battling with the wmd for the possession of her flat pasteboard box and her umbrella, and he turned her back with the startling Mtelligence that it was no use going forward ; both roads and railways were alike blocked with snow. \" It cost Mr. Charles a gumea for a cab to carry him and me from the city to Oxford-street,\" he said, \" and Mr. Charles is -obliged to sleep at the bank. It is not possible to get home to Cromwell-road. It is well he keeps a dress-suit at the bank, or he woMd be in a pretty predicament. He is in as bad a plight as I am ; he has been workmg like a navvy to save the poor crea tures' lives and property in Southwark, and I've been helpmg him. A downright good-hearted fellow is Mr. Charles. I wish there were more like him.\" \"If Mr. Charles is in your condition,\" cried Rachel (by this time m the house), when her brother removed his overcoat and \u25a0displayed a mass of clinging wet cloth, the hue of the muddy \u00abarpet, \" I think he had need to change. You are wet tMough. Get your things off this minute and into sometMng dry. I'll"], [294, "282 THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. have your tea ready in a moment,\" in her concern for her brother losing sight for the moment of her other anxieties. What had taken the two young men to Oxford-street so imperatively that it was worth a guinea in cab-hire, he did not say ; but it was just the two tab-ends of silk, and theh relation to the bank and the banker's son. The bank held two heavy bills of exchange drawn by Eugene Delcroix on the London agents of the firm, and due on the 24th. The name had arrested attention. It was no secret that Miss Trevor, who had thrown young Mr. Charles overboard, was about to marry the great Lyons silk manufacturer's nephew. Then there was something exceptional m the drawing of bills on the agent by an individual member of the firm. There had been some comment on this in the bank parlour, but the presence of the younger Delcroix in London was presumed to account for the drawing of the bills. Valuable presents to the bride and bridesmaids might have caused it. Struck by the coincidence of the two dresses in his sister's ; hands, coupled with the assertion that the silk was a fresh design from the loom, and not to be matched in London, Ambrose Nelson mentioned the singular discrepancy to Mr. Charles. The pair had a long conference, the result bemg a request for the tab-ends. The one dress had been a CMistmas-box from Charles to his sister. The visit to Oxford-street was to the establishment at which it had been purchased \u2014 a visit for enquiries. Being a customer, one of a family of customers, Mr. Charles Driffield had not much difficulty in ascertaining that the first dress of the piece had been sold to a foreign gentleman with black hair and moustache, who took it away with him in a cab. The salesman remembered because it was a first season's silk, peculiar m style and pattern ; and the buyer was particular in having a, silk from the looms of \" Messrs. Delcroix et Neveu.\" And then the attentive salesman pointed out the private mark of their proprietor on each tab, in addition to that of the maker's. It was rather singular that Monsieur Eugene Delcroix, fresh from Lyons, should go into a London shop to purchase a solitary dress from a piece of their own manufacture, before presenting himself as a Christmas guest in Chelsea. More singular that he should say his gist was a design fresh from the loom, and could not be matched in London. It certainly looked queer, not to say suspicious, and so the young men argued on their way back to the city."], [295, "THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. 283 Never within living memory had such a snowstorm visited this country as that of January, 1881. As the flakes grew thicker and larger, so the wind, circling and eddying, drifted it into heaps, and drove it into the eyes of the few pedestrians abroad. Shops were closed, or closing, such omnibuses as still kept the road had six horses tugging at the harness, and cabs were not to be had for hire unless there was a second quad ruped to help the first through the cloggmg snow. Gentlemen were belated at theh clubs, and passengers by train to extreme suburbs had to pass the night in the railway carriages. The high tide on the south side of the Thames was but one feature in the wide spread and disastrous storm. Charles Driffield did not grudge his guinea, but he chafed with impatience at the slow progress of the vehicle, and woffld have sprung forth to walk had he not seen people whitened over, with icicles pendant from brows and beards, wading and plunging knee deep in snow, and floundering deeper here and there. Two hours later he was across Blackfriar's Bridge, plunging breast high m water, or urging a horse forward to the rescue of women and children whose homes were wrecked and whose lives were in peril. And the records of his bravery and humanity found their way with the late morning papers to Theresa Trevor ; the interest in wMch seemed to swallow up interest in her delayed wedding-dress. Between Charles Driffield and Ambrose Nelson existed a degree of friendliness not commonly shown to junior clerks, and due m a great measure to old schoolfellowship, but no doubt kept alive by the small stray drops of intelligence concerning Theresa Trevor which came distilled through the medium of the clerk's sister, for though they had quarrelled and parted, the love of a life was not to be dissipated with a breath. Ambrose himself was mfluenced by gratitude for the helping hand extended to himself and sisters, and there was no honour able service he would not have rendered in requital. Hence the little confidence anent the wedding-dress, and their joint visit to the draper's. Aster the long ruminating silence in the cab, Charles Driffield broke out suddenly,\" The more I think, the more I am convinced Miss Trevor is making a mistake ; and though it is nothing to me individually now, Nelson, I consider it my duty to ward off a blow such as I fear is in store for her. I should bless the coming of this storm if it would only put off her wedding to the twenty -fifth. We might then have proof one way or other.\" \"I'd have the proof before morning if I'd my will,\" said Nelson, \"Desperate diseases demand desperate remedies. I"], [296, "284 THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. should go confidentially to Delcroix's agents and ask if those bills are all right.\" \" But it would seem \" \"No matter what it woffld seem. The end is to be thought of in this case.\" There was no return of the inundating tide on the Wednesday morning, as had been prognosticated : the poor creatures shivering in wet and fireless homes could set about to repair the damage where repair was possible, and generosity had lent a helping band to the work. For one, Miriam, with tueked-up skirts, boldly attacked the mud and rust, though deplorfflg the utter destruction of their carpet, which was good, if not new, knowing well how it woffld tax all their means to replace it, and that it would mean extra hard work for Rachel. But Rachel bade her consider how much better, they were off than their neighbours, whose furniture had been washed out or broken to bits ; and soon, aster having made hermother comfortable upstairs, she was free to sally forth with the box in which the precious wedding-dress reposed. A brown paper parcel was superadded containing Miss Driffield's ball-dress. A grievous encumbrance she found the latter as she made her way through the muddy deposit along Belvedere-road, and after the train landed her at Sloane-square ; for to her dismay, the whole length of the long King's-road, the snow was heaped shoulder high and the narrow passage cleared was barely wide enough to admit her parcels as well as herself, still less to allow two persons to meet and pass. It was quite noon when she rang the bell at the gate of Mulberry House, utterly worn-out with her long walk through the snow. Miss Minton came flying into the hall to meet her. \" Oh, you are here !\" she exclaimed. \" We were afraid some disaster had happened to the dress. Come upstairs. My cousm will be with you directly.\" She could not tell how much her cousin had hoped that some disaster had befallen the silk and satin on which her very destiny seemed to depend ; and that cousm herself could not tell how much of her destmy did depend on it. The dress was tried on, examined, admired, and pronounced \" charming \" by Miss Minton, who decided that her cousin would \" make a lovely bride.\" But the bride herself was rather listless m her inspection, and appeared more eagerly attentive to Miss Nelson's apology for not brmging it home the night before than M the fit of the bodice or the sweep of the tram."], [297, "THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. 285 She was aroused by the graphic account of the flood from an eye-witness, and took out her purse to send help for the poor, whose misery was described with so much feelmg ; but her heart seemed to stand still as the narrative involved the condition in which her brother came home, and the heroic exploits of Mr. Charles and Ambrose in the rescue of poor creatures, apparently doomed to destruction. She, however, made no show of her emotion that was not covered by her sympathy for the poor whose homes were wrecked, and ffldeed, her heart was full. There was sorrow for others \u2014 sorrow for herself, the bride-expectant. Wine and cake were ordered for Miss Nelson, who declined anythmg more substantial ; she was paid, there was a handsome supplement for the poor, and a bell was rung for a servant to show her to the door. Instead, the servant, obeymg other mstructions, ushered her fflto the drawing-room on the ground-floor. To her surprise, she confronted old Mr. Trevor, who appeared strangely agitated ; Mr. Driffield, a stately, grey -haired man, whom she just knew by sight, and her own brother. \" Miss Nelson,\" said the banker, graciously, \" your brother tells us you have my daughter's dress with you. Will you oblige by showing it to Mr. Trevor ? I presume the young ladies upstairs have not seen it ? \" he added, as she proceeded to untie the parcel. \" Certainly not, sir,\" she replied, and would have then shaken the dress loose for exhibition, but a hand interposed. \" That will do ; we offly desire to inspect the material.\" \" Well, my old friend,\" contmued Mr. Driffield, as Mr. Trevor exammed the material and pattern through his eyeglass, \" are they alike? \" \" They are the same,\" was the answer, which seemed to come with a gasp. \" Thank you, young lady, that will do,\" said Mr. Driffield kindly ; \" and by-the-bye, you need not mention to Miss Driffield that I have made a premature exhibition of her dress.\" It was all a puzzle to Bachel, who wondered what it all meant. \" And Ambrose there too ! \" she said to herself as she left the house ; \" it is very singular.\" She did not hear the banker's remark as the door closed behind her \u2014 \" You see, my friend, so far it is offly presumptive evidence.

It certainly tells against him that the dress paraded as fresh from the Lyons manufactory should have been purchased in Oxford-street. It was the duplicate dress which first aroused our suspicions. For your child's sake, defer the ceremony, if only for a day. But make no other sign, and above all show no suspicion. Had it not been for this unusual storm doubt might have been already at rest (he did not say how). Charles will not leave a stone unturned, be sure.\" It was no easy matter for Erasmus Trevor to conceal his agitation when the happiness of his only child was at stake. And no easy matter to believe that the man he had received under his roof, to whom he had promised his daughter's hand, and thhty thousand pounds with it, should be other than he seemed. A forger, a swindler \u2014 impossible ! He must be Eugene Delcroix. He knew all the ins and outs of their trade. Yet, surely, there could be no harm in a day's delay. The storm, the impassable roads, the retarded preparations, were sufficient reasons. As if to assist him in this dilemma, a letter from Miss Minton's father and mother was handed to him, excusing Mr. Minton and his wife from appearing at the ceremony on those very grounds. \" We regret it, but could not risk our necks, or those of our horses, in an attempt to reach you ; and we fear you will not have many guests at the wedding, if this frost does not break up beforehand.\" Armed with that missive, he was emboldened to propose a few* days' delay, and suggest telegrams to the invited, \" Wedding postponed on account of the frost and bad roads.\" Mrs. Trevor seconded the motion. \" It will enable us to have the ceiling and staircase put in proper condition,\" she said. Strange to say, Theresa, from some unknown impulse or desire, fell in with the suggestion. \" Better wait a week,\" she said. \" I am half dead with cold already, and the church would freeze me altogether.\" \" And we can't go up the aisle muffled up m wraps,\" put in Ethel, who had a charming costume to display. Erasmus Trevor did not find Monsieur Eugene so compliant. Business demanded his presence in France, he urged. There was no likelihood of a thaw. It would upset all his arrangements ; interfere seriously with the business of the firm. His uncle would be displeased. \" Suppose we telegraph to your uncle ? \" said Mr. Trevor. \"Oh, dear no ! It is not necessary.\""], [299, "THERESA TREVOR'S WEDDING DRESS. 287 He would not hear of that ; but betook himself to Theresa to win her over. Theresa simply declared he \" was most unreasonable,\" and ad hered to her father's proposal. The delayed French mail-packet Petrel landed her mails and passengers at the Admiralty-pier, Dover, that Wednesday evening late, and the special train, sent on with both to London, brought a special passenger. As the family at Mulberry House sat down to luncheon on the Thursday \u2014 that luncheon which might have been a wedding breakfast \u2014 \" Monsieur Delcroix \" was announced. \" There's your man,\" cried the new-comer to a policeman at his heels, and in less than five minutes, he who might even then have been Mr. Trevor's son-in-law, was led handcuffed from the room, and \u2014 Theresa had fainted. Mrs. Trevor and Miss Minton were all amazement. Mr. Trevor, as we know, was somewhat prepared, but even he was startled. Monsieur Delcroix apologised and explained. A mysterious telegram inviting him to the marriage of his nephew with Miss Trevor had come to him, and been opened in the presence of his nephew, a married man. It was their first clue to the whereabouts of a man personating that nephew, an absconding confidential clerk, who had robbed them to a large amount. He had forged their signatures freely. His London agent had told him fresh forgeries were afloat. Eugene Lapont would have to answer elsewhere for his crimes. He, Monsieur Delcroix, could offly congratulate his old customer and his amiable daughter on theh narrow escape. And Mr. Trevor, having disclaimed all knowledge of the telegram which had brought him off on the instant, said he wished he knew how to thank and reward the sender. So said the Trevors, one and all, but it was not until Theresa had confessed her mistake to Charles Driffield, with tears of shame and bitterness, and had told him what a reprieve she had felt the postponement of the nuptials, that he owned to sending the telegram on the sole suspicion engendered by the falsehood respectmg the silk. \" It was Nelson's suggestion,\" he said. \" Nelson urged that the telegram could do no harm unless the fellow was an impostor, and would surely lead to detection if he were.

And Charles set his seal upon it then and there with loving and forgiving lips. It is likely that before this story comes to light Miss Trevor will have ordered a new wedding-dress, and from the same dress maker, now comfortably housed at Chelsea, beyond the reach of high tides, and within reach of her many customers.

I was almost sorry I had asked her for the brooch, she seemed so strangely stirred. But such indistinct regrets are transient at sixteen ; and I had set my mind on the trinket when I was quite a little thing. It was a dumpy oval brooch, scarcely so large as my little finger-nail, with a catch and pin strong enough to sustain the great photograph our greengrocer's wife displays beneath her chin. Though it was lined at the back with thick red gold, the stones \u2014 a topaz surrounded by diamonds \u2014 were set in silver. Unlike anything m my own mamma's store of ornaments, I think its diminutive proportions first set me longing for its possession. \" Offly ! \" Grandma repeated the word, and drew a long breath. \"My dear, you could scarcely have pitched upon anything I should have been so loth to part with \u2014 anything I have preserved more sacredly.

What do you see there ? \" I held the brooch to the light. \" ' W. Y.' Well, I declare ! I never saw the letters before ! \" Reason good : they were half obliterated with wear, and I had never looked for such. \" Ah ! my dear, I wish I had never seen them. I should be sorry if your young eyes and heart were to ache over a lover's initials as mine have done over those of William Yetts.

I won't bother you with a long pedigree ; it is enough that one of my father's many sisters was the widow of a Scotch muslin manufacturer, and at his death had returned to her native place, and there established a branch of the trade he had carried on in Glasgow. At that time wMte muslin was universally worn, and almost as universally sprigged or spotted. This was done in a tambour-frame, with a hook \u2014 or needle, as it was called \u2014 resembling your crochet-hook, only sharper, to pierce the muslin. My Aunt Dick had a large house in Greengate, Salford, where she employed a number of girls and women over tambour-frames, besides others who embroidered with the needle at their own homes. \" The large front room had been converted into a kmd of office or sale-room, where my aunt, a portly woman, received buyers and commercial travellers, put out work, or inspected work brought in, and paid wages on a Saturday. Behind that was her ordinary sitting-room, the walls of which were painted a good serviceable brown. The furniture, too, was none of the modern gimcrack, to upset with the sweep of a skirt or tremble beneath the weight of a man, but solid Spanish mahogany, brightened without French polish ; and the seats of sofa and chairs were covered with chmtz that was not afraid of the wash tub. It was connected with the counting-house by a glass door, over which fell a transparent curtain of yellow leno. Some few of the traders with whom she dealt were privileged to pass this barrier, and transact their business over her table instead of the counter ; and many a hundred pounds changed hands m that brown back room. There was more simplicity both in busmess and social intercourse then, my dear Lily ; and fortunes were made in warehouses on which modern merchants \u2014 trading"], [303, "A wife's extravagance. 291 \u25a0on mythical capital \u2014 would look down m contempt. But this was sixty years ago, and times are changed. I am changed.\" \" Indeed you are, grandma,\" I cried, glancing towards an ivory miffiature m a deep gilt frame over the fireplace, \" if you were like that.\" It was the picture of an exquisitely lovely girl about my own age, with jet black hair banded over a beautiful forehead, with eyebrows like pencilled arches, a straight nose, if anytMng too foil at the tip, a dimpled chin, a mouth like a very rosebud, intensely dark grey eyes, full of dreamy languor, and a complexion so pure, so delicately transparent, I might have given the artist credit for flattery, had not the dear old lady m her seventy-fifth year retained much of the rose-bloom, and all the pearlmess of skin. \" Well, my dear,\" she resumed, \" just such as that picture was I, Amelia Daniel, when, foil of life and vivacity, I tripped up the two steps mto my Aunt Dick's counting-house one brisk December afternoon, and,j-all unconscious of the fate lurking behind the glass door, commenced a lively chat with her and my cousin Mary, a school-girl yet in pmafores. I had not been there more than ten rmnutes, when my cousin Thomas, a young surgeon, came m from the street, shook hands with me heartily, and then leaned an elbow on the counter as if disposed to join m our gossip. \" ' Thomas, Mr. Yetts will be tired of waitmg for you. He has been in the parlour all alone sfflce I lest him in order to speak to Amelia.,' said my aunt, rather impatiently ; whereupon Thomas agam shook hands with me ; and as he turned the handle of the glass door, I saw Mm give a slight start before he entered, and became only a voice. \" In a few minutes more I was on my way home, wondering who was the Mr. Yetts waiting for Tom. Clearly he was some one of importance, or I should never have been permitted to trudge home alone. But what caused Tom to start so palpably as he opened the door ? It was not until long afterwards that I was enlightened, and then Mr. Yetts himself was the informant. It happened that Tom, opefflng the door suddenly, had pushed it inwards agamst Mr. Yetts, who had thus allowed Mmself to be caught peering through the tMn leno blmds into the counting house. \" Making no apology, he exclaimed, with abruptness, ' Who s that angelic creature ? I never beheld such a face and form m my life ; I have been enraptured ! ' You must know, Lily, I was wearing a closely-fittmg cloth pelisse trimmed with fur, and people did use very Mgh-flown language in those days."], [304, "292 A wife's extravagance. \" ' That young lady is my cousin, Mr. Yetts,' Tom answered, coldly. \" ' Lucky fellow you to claim such cousinship ! I wish I stood M your shoes. Yet, now I look at you, it may be you have an eye to a closer relationship.' \" ' Pshaw ! A ghl of sixteen ! ' But there was as much irritation as contempt in Tom's disclahner. \" ' She will soon outgrow that defect,' put in Mr. Yetts, dryly ; adding hastily, as he still kept watch on us in the counting house, ' surely, Mr. Dick, you will not suffer your lovely cousin to walk home alone ? It is not safe with so many coxcombs about.' \" ' Oh, trust Amelia to take care of herself. She is accustomed to go about alone, and is not endangered by a consciousness of her own attractions,' Tom replied, brusquely, as if he thought the other officious. He was unwilling to admit that to keep the fascinating Mr. Yetts in the background had alone deterred him from joimng me. \" He was sharp enough to take Thomas Dick's hint, and turned to business as if there was never a young lady in the world. But thenceforth he contrived that business itself should call him repeatedly to Mrs. Dick's muslin warehouse, and whilst effecting some very heavy sales for her, be contrived to cultivate the private friendship of her son. He calculated that if he kept close to one or the other he would be sure to meet the pretty fflece in the long run. \" Failmg m this he adroitly led my aunt fflto conversation on her family connections. A question respectfflg the lovely ghl in the cloth pelisse, whom he bad chanced to see tMough the glass door, was natural enough, and his mterlocutor was of malleable metal. There happened, however, to be two Amelias who called Mrs. Dick aunt, and she either did not or could not recall which he had seen. \" My aunt was a very amiable woman, soft and yieldmg m disposition, and with a talent for matchmakmg, so that she fell in readily with his scheme for settlmg the perplexity without making either young lady wiser. This was, to invite a family party at Christmas fflcludfflg all her ffleces, he gallantly volun teering to bear the principal cost. \" This latter consideration was conclusive. Aunt Dick was fond of company and good living ; but in Scotland, Lily, she had been imbued with her husband's tMisty ways, and taught to look on both sides of a bawbee before she spent it. \" A Christmas-party at little cost was jnot to be sniffed at."], [305, "A wife's extravagance. 293 She sent out her invitations in high glee ; and there was not one \u25a0of her ffleces or nephews who did not accept, under the notion that Aunt Dick must have bad a windfall, or made an extraordinary bargaffl some way. \" It fell out that Mr. Yetts made the acquaintance of the two Amelias prior to the actual evening ; he appearing to thmk it fine fun to help Tom and us with the holly and mistletoe, and keep us alive with pleasant sallies thereon. \" It did not strike me then that he was more assiduous m assisting me than any of the others ; I was too busy and too much amused to notice or think of it. \" But when the eventful evening came I had more leisure for observation. And I think there must have been a more than ordmary flutter under my short- waisted white muslin bodice as I sat and watched the semi-circle of chairs around aunt's blazmg foe gradually fill with matronly satms and velvets, all narrow in skirt and sleeve and bodice, and with youthful muslffls and gauzes equally scanty. Married women at that time invariably covered theh heads, the younger ones with lace caps, and the elder ones with turbans ; maidenly tresses were, as a rule, enwreathed with flowers, and I remember well I wore a wreath of white rosebuds above my black curls. I remember it partly because my sisters had protested agamst my wearmg the wreath as not proper for a child like Amelia ; and partly because everythmg connected with that party was printed on my mind indelibly. I watched my uncles in their drab or brown coats and knee-breeches, ruffled shirts and muslm ties, take their places and exchange pmches of snuff; and my more fashionable cousms m claret or blue coats, with white or nankeen trousers, as they spread the chcle wider, with a military uniform or two as a brilliant finish. Such family gatherings were not altogether new.

It is odd I did not include my eldest sister Jane ffl this half unconscious category ; it might be because she still wore mourning for her lover, kffled in the Peninsular War, and bad wiped matrimony out of her dictionary. \" Supper was laid m the parlour, on the large dmmg-table with D ends ; and again Mr. Yetts smgled out me to hand downstairs and place at the hospitably-spread board on a seat beside himself ; whilst I, between the dancfflg, the negus, and the subtle flattery of a gentleman's undivided attention, was brimful of delight and animal spirits. No doubt my eyes sparkled as I exchanged a brisk fire of repartee with him, as freely as had been my wont with my many cousins. \"Of the supper itself I remember little more than that cousin Thomas sat at one end of the table, and my Aunt Dick at the other, and that there seemed to be as much talkmg and laughter as eating and drinkmg, and there was plenty of both. \"I don't know how it was, but, all at once, the ring of Mr- Yetts agam arrested my glance as he was handing me a nhnce-pie. Extremely impulsive, and marvellously destitute of tact I have been all my years \u2014 never more so than when I blurted out, with the freedom of a child or an old acquamtance, ' What a curious and beautiful ring that is of yours, Mr. Yetts ! ' \" ' Do you think so ? ' said he, taking off the ring. ' I am glad you admire it ; it was my mother's ; ' and as he spoke he handed it to me for nearer inspection. \" Thoughtlessly I slipped it on my own finger, and turned my hand about to see it sparkle in the candlelight, all unconscious of the observation I attracted. \" ' Amelia ! \\ cried my Aunt Dick from the far end of the long table, with a smile like a sunbeam all over lier fat face, ' I bid you be careful what you do with that rfflg ; it is a charmed circlet. There is a spell in it ! ' \"'Oh, is there?;' laughed I. 'How funny! What is it, aunt ?

It always passes to the eldest son's wife.' \" Had the sparkling trinket held electric fire it could not have flamed more quicMy in my face. I felt the hot blood rushing over cheeks and brow as, with a sudden flush of conscious ness in which womanhood was born, I strove, amidst titters and laughter, to pluck it from my finger. \" It would not come off! It had slipped on my plump finger easily enough, but every effort to remove the ring offly seemed to tighten it ; whilst my ears were assailed with banter and innuendoes, mirthful, sly, or malicious, as the case might be ; and I grew more painfully perplexed every minute, in spite of the whispered advice of Mr. Yetts to leave it alone awhile, and not to mind the badinage, to wMch he replied so as to shield me somewhat from their shafts. \" None of them, however, smote me more keenly than the icily-uttered suggestion of Thomas Dick, ' You had better steep your finger in cold water, Amelia ; and if it does not slip from. the finger then, I will file it off for you.' \" ' Pardon me, sir ; no file must touch my mother's ring,' promptly put in Mr. Yetts, as if Ms word was conclusive. Then, turning to poor me, he added, ' If Miss Amelia will honour me by wearing the trinket until to-morrow, there will be less difficulty in restormg it \u2014 if such be her will,' appended, m a tone which reached no ears save mine, and mine they set tinglmg. \" ' A charmed circlet,' indeed. Not only had my finger swollen round it, but my heart began to stir with unknown tfoobbings. \" Gladly would I have hid my embarrassment m the back ground, but there might have been a conspiracy agamst me. I was so often called when the trencher was turned, and so desperately chased at bhnd-man's buff, and found myself so often under the kissing-bush, that my cheeks were as red as its holly berries, and no one appeared more delighted than Aunt Dick, or less satisfied than Thomas. \" It was morning when the party broke up, or, rather, went away m a body, separating as we neared our respective homes. \" I had still the ring upon my finger, and coffld offly murmur something I feared was half inaudible of my regrets, and a hope to get it off in the course of a few hours. \" ' Do not trouble, Miss Amelia ; I am m no hurry for it.

I know I bolted the door of my bedroom, as if I feared intrusion on my dreamy retrospect of the evening, so delightful in anticipation and realisation ; and a visionary world of light and bloom, music and perfume, shone before me m the distance. \" From this reverie I was sharply roused by an imperative rattle of the door-handle, followed by an imperative knock, and the demand, ' What have you bolted the door for, miss ? ' of Anna, who shared my room, and was not accustomed to be shut out. \" She was cross and disagreeable ; took me to task for being so long undressing, and the light of the candle glancing on the brilliant ring, it furnished a pretext for a lecture on ' forward chits.' \" I covered my head and the ring with the bed-clothes, and pretended to drop asleep. The pretence became reality ; and not Aladdin's ring could have transported the wearer to such realms of phantasy as I danced tMough in my dreams. \" You must know, my dear, that your great-grandpapa's trade was mostly a foreign one. The long war had caused him serious losses ; and we four girls, not caring to be behind our richer cousins in the matter ot dress, or to tax our burthened father for wardrobes and pocket-money, had for a long while secretly plied industrious needles in brace-fitting for the warehouse, being paid as the ordinary workwomen were. This enabled us to make an appearance beyond anything our father's crippled means would have justified, and I am afraid the outside world judged us accord ing to that appearance, and voted us extravagant. ' If they earn gold, let them wear gold,' was good-natured Aunt Dennet's rebuke to one of our own relatives who aspersed us in her presence during a ball at The Grange, where our elegantMarianne outshone all compeers. But, Lily, I now tMnk the censor came nearer the truth. It was unbecoming for John Daniel's girls to dress so as to excite remark, even though they did work, and work hard, for what they had \u2014 aye, and added more to home comforts than outsiders knew. \" I mention this, because we were stitchmg away, as if for our lives, the next day (I was back-stitching a bright red leather tab with yellow silk), when a loud ran-tan sounded on the front door. Who could it be ? None of our cousins ; they would have turned the handle and have walked in.

At this time, I imagine he plunged Mr. Yetts mto our midst, partly to watch my reception of him and partly to deter so elegant a gentleman from cultivatfflg our acquamtance aster such introduction. If that was his object it signally failed. Jane \u2014 the only one to receive Mr. Yetts with courtesy \u2014 apologised with so much grace and candour for our occupation, that, before the others had recovered from their chagrin, the visitor had drawn correct conclusions, and we lost nothmg of his esteem. My dear mother came m, and was mtroduced ; but once more Mr. Yetts smgled out me for attention, and once more I endeavoured to extricate my finger from his ring ffleffectually. \"I know my face was crimsoned with blushes; not the less that cousm Thomas watched us so mtently. Mr. Yetts would not hear of the ring being forcibly removed, or touched with a Me ; but made it the hmge on which the house-door was to turn for Ms entrance on future occasions\u2014' with Mrs. Daniel's gracious permission ' \u2014 and I caught a glance which said those future occasions woffld be many. \"When the twain departed, pleasure took leave. With the exception of Jane, my sisters twitted and jeered me, until the crimson deepened pamfully, even to the tips of my ears. \" ' She shall have a sweetheart, she shall,' cried Marianne from the wmdow-seat ; and the others took up her words like a chorus. \"I could stand it no longer. With flashing eyes I jumped from my seat, flung down the red leather tab, gave vent to my feelings in a stfflgfflg retort (repented ever aster), and rushed from the room to the solitude of my own chamber, where my gentle mother found me sobbmg quite an hour later. \" Well, my dear, the upshot was as might have been expected. The rmg remained on my finger, and my sisters took good care I should not forget the fact, particularly as Mr. Yetts became a frequent visitor, havfflg mgratiated himself with mother and father both \u2014 perhaps by his readiness to play a game of cribbage -or backgammon with the latter. \" Two or three months had gone by in this way. Mr. Yetts"], [310, "298 a wife's extravagance. had begun to meet us on our way from church, and the others,. having their own beaus, were too glad to be relieved of a burden some ' third party ' to look much after me. From walking beside me he began to ask, on fine afternoons, for an extension of our walk ; and on one of these occasions \u2014 my seventeenth birthday, the 31st of March \u2014 we strolled as far as Aunt Dick's, and as we went he made my heart leap and palpitate by asking me to keep his mother's ring as a birthday token of betrothal to himself. I was too confused to remember all he said of his adoration, of his falling in love at first sight, and his resolve to win me for his own ; but every word deepened the impression he had already made upon my heart, and my lips were only too proud to give up its secret. Being in the street he could but for a moment lay his disengaged hand with a quick pressure upon mine, which rested on his arm ; but I know mine trembled beneath his touch, and my pulse throbbed with my new happffless. How much my face revealed I can well imagine. \" When at last we reached Greengate, Aunt Dick was upstairs,. indulging in an after-dinner nap. Mary had gone to our house, and Tom was in the parlour alone, readmg. He gave a start and changed colour, as we walked in together. I shook hands with him gaily, as usual, and then went upstairs to my aunt ; and, oh ! what a tell-tale countenance was that I saw in her oval swing-glass ! No wonder Thomas had read it like a book. \" No sooner had I closed the parlour door than he rose, and with some sharpness demanded from William Yetts the meafflng of his pointed attentions to me. \" ' You are a man of the world, Mr. Yetts, and do nothing without calculatoin, whilst my cousin Amelia is young and unsophisticated, and will listen to that beguiling voice of yours as if it spoke gospel. Her feelmgs may become entangled before she is aware.

' I do not see by what right, sir, you presume ' \" ' The right of relationship and manhood, Mr. Yetts. Amelia has no brother to watch over her ; her father is unable at present, and I hold it my duty to see that her young affections are not trifled with.' \" Mr. Yetts stepped forward, put a hand on each of Tom's shoulders, and looked him steadfastly in the face. ' Your senti ments do you honour, Mr. Dick ; but, frankly speaking, I do not think your championship wholly disinterested ; and as I"], [311, "a wife's extravagance. 299 have this day asked Miss Amelia to be my wife I should like to be satisfied on that score.' \" Tom wavered for a moment, a sort of shudder passed over Mm ; then he grasped William firmly by the hand. ' I congratu late you, though you have won the one I had set my own mind on. I thought her too young to be addressed. Well, let the best man win. If you only make her happy I shall be satisfied ; but if ever you play her false, or grieve her, you shall answer for it ! ' \"How did I know all this, Lily ? Well, my dear, William told me himself a year afterwards, when Thomas had commenced practice for himself, and a Miss Keith was setting her cap at Mm \u2014 she had some money, and aunt was eager for the match. I know I laughed merrily at the idea of cousin Tom ever fancy ing me, and clung closer to the lover who was all the world to me, and whose rmg seemed a pledge of eternal union. \" Soon after this Marianne married, and that seemed to make Mr. Yetts wishful that we should be married too. I began to make preparations quietly, and stuck closer to my needle than any of my father's workwomen, spending the money I so earned not offly on a wardrobe, but on articles of household use and ornament. I had a corner cupboard filled with china and such tMngs. \" William on his part was mdefatigable in business, though I sometimes thought he cut more of a dash than was needful ; but he insisted it was essential to success, and I was silenced. He began to look out for a partner with capital, and soon another name appeared upon Ms signboard \u2014 ' Yetts and Blackmore ' \u2014 tradfflg on their own account as well as on commission. \" His next thought was a house, and he took me to look at several, or rather to ratify Ms choice of one he had already selected \u2014 a stylish-looking house m the suburbs \u2014 a house alto gether beyond our means. \" ' There,' said he, ' what do you thmk of that, Amelia ? Do you not think we may be very happy here ? ' \" I must have looked perplexed, for William burst Mto a fit of laughter, which caused him to lean agamst the marble mantel piece, whilst the echoes of his mirth rang through the empty house, and somehow struck me with a sudden fear. \" ' You little simpleton ! ' laughed he, drawmg me to his breast. 1 1 calculate everything ; this handsome house will be a part of my capital. A man must launch out if he means to make his way M the world. \" ' Part of your capital ! ' I echoed, dreamily. He was speakmg m enigmas to me."], [312, "300 A wife's extravagance. \" ' Part of my capital ! ' he repeated, with emphatic deliberation. ' Do you not comprehend ? ' \" He saw that I did not. \" ' I always thought that my Amelia was a sMewd little woman of business. Here, my love, sit down beside me whilst I make it clear.' So saying he spread his silk Barcelona handkerchief over a workman's narrow bench, and, drawing me close with his arm, began to expound his views to me with easy confidence, as if sure of my acquiescence, and I, Amelia Daniel, the child of high-souled parents, sat and listened in the silence of unutterable agony. \" ' You see, Amelia, it is not necessary I should pay for the furniture down on the nail. My credit is good ; I shall go to a first rate upholsterer and give my orders, taking you with me to make your own selection, and so bring your loveliness and fashion, and your father's well-known name, to back up my own credit. When all is finished, and the house ready, I can pay Mm a trifle in cash, and the rest in bills at long dates, which I can meet or renew as may be most convenient. He is sure to charge pretty stiffly, and may afford to wait, or even to lose sometMng in the long run. Then I shall lay in a stock of wines on a similar principle, so that when we are married we can do things in style. We must give a few grand parties ; I shall invite manufacturers and traders to dinner, where your beauty will be as attractive as the wine ; and many a good bargain I hope to make that way.' \" ' Oh, indeed ! ' \" ' Yes, my dear ; we must do things with dash and spirit, and if we can maintain a good appearance in public, I gain commercial importance and credit M ratio. You are a good manager, and economical, but the world need not know that. In a few years I mean to make a grand smash.' \"'A what?' \" ' A grand smash, a failure, offer a few shillings in the pound, and keep the balance snug to make a fresh start with.' \" ' But your books ?' I whispered, almost breathless. \" 'Oh, I shall manipulate them! It is only putting down an extra ten pounds here and twenty pounds there for household expenses, or my wife's dress ; and as you and your sisters have a character for extravagance it is sure to pass. It is not every one who has been behind the scenes as I have, or knows how careful a wife I shall have to help me to make a fortune.' \" I rose half choked with pain and indignation ; but I spoke with icy coldness as I confronted him. \" ' It is not every woman who is allowed to look behind the"], [313, "a wife's extravagance. 301 scenes before marriage, or there might be fewer fortunes built on wives' extravagance.' And without another word I turned to leave the house, which seemed to be the tomb of all my hopes. \" I saw that he was stunned by my retort ; I saw him set his teeth and knit his brows ; and then I heard him laugh out loudly (but the laugh had not a true ring) as he followed me to the garden, and took my hand \u2014 which I withdrew \u2014 as he cried, ' What a capital joke ! I did not think my Amelia was so credu lous.' \" How he strove, first by banter and then by seemingly righteous mdignation, to convince me he had only been testing my mettle \u2014 my mtegrity \u2014 and was injured by my suspicions of him ! He said I ought to have known he was playmg a part, and that that was not the house he had chosen ; in proof whereof he took me to another, much more likely to come within our honest means and expectations. \"The smaller house was decided on, but there appeared some delay m arranging with the owner. Then it so happened that his rapidly extending business called William away for two or tMee days at a time to country manufacturers (you know, Lily, there were no railways) ; now and then he had to dine or spend an evefflng with his moneyed partner, Mr. Blackmore ; and though his warmth and ardour were not apparently diminished, I felt there was a difference ; and even my sisters coffld twit me with his frequent absence, and suggest that ' a newer face had caught his fancy.' \" Thomas Dick, by this time engaged to Miss Keith, asked me one day \u2014 I thought curiously \u2014 if I had heard Mr. Yetts mention Mr. Blackmore's sister. \" A cold shiver seemed to run through me, and mvoluntarily I looked down on my ring \u2014 no longer a fixture. I had grown thinner with anxiety of late. \" That evefflng I took William to task : but he offly laughed at my jealous fears, said Miss Blackmore was older than himself, and not his style of woman. \" The followmg Monday he came M, with a carpet-bag m his hand ; said he was going to Rochdale, but should be back to spend Wednesday evening with me. \" Wednesday evening came, but no William. Instead, came James Dennet and Thomas Dick with concert tickets. Sara was ready enough to go, but Anna did not care for music, and Jane went nowhere. I dechned, solely because William was not there to escort me, and woffld be jealous if I went with either of my cousins. But Tom would take no nay. He said I was moping"], [314, "302 a wipe's extravagance. for a fellow who did not deserve me ; and Anna added that if I had a grain of spirit I should not be kept at home waiting for him. \"That decided it. I went; and we called for Miss Keith on our way. Ours were not full-dress tickets, and we went m our bonnets ; consequently we occupied side seats, and, not being early, were far up the room. \" We had barely settled ourselves, when an under-breathed \" Hallo !\" from Tom fell on my ear ; and I looked up from our programme to see, walking down the aisle, William Yetts, got-up most elaborately, with a tall, regal-looking woman on Ms arm, and a smile on his face such as I had fondly thought offly I could evoke. Of her dress I saw nothmg but a noddmg plume and a crimson scarf \u2014 the concert-room seemed to swim round with me. I had a dim consciousness that Mr. Blackmore followed in their wake ; but I was certam of notMng but of William's presence there with another woman in my place. \" They had swept on to the front of the dress seats, seemg nothmg of us, knowing nothmg of the achfflg heart on the side bench. \"I saw Tom's glance of indignation change to a look of compassionate regret as he bent down to bid me ' show a bold front, Amelia, and bear up.' And I did, shakmg off my sudden faintness. \" Perhaps James Dennet's muttered anathemas and Tom's undertones epithets had less to do with the bold front than Sara's ill-timed remark \u2014 ' So that's how the wonderful Mr. William spends his evenings, is it ?' \" I held up \u2014 listened to the music and smging, and made light of the matter. Yet I was thankful enough when Thomas or someone proposed that we should leave early, to avoid the crush. I saw that Thomas Dick was boiling over with suppressed rage, and I was afraid of a collision. \" My cousins and Miss Keith went home with us to supper ; and I lest them to entertain the old folks in the dining room behind, whilst I sat down, with my misery, m the front parlour. \" An hour and a half had elapsed when I heard William's foot on the step. I rushed to anticipate his knock, lest he should be heard by the two angry men within ; and I had no mind they should meet. \" He wore a drab overcoat, as if he had just come off a journey ; indeed, he apologised for befog so late (it was midnight) by saymg the roads were blocked with snow, and the coach had offly just"], [315, "a wife's extravagance. 303 come m.

Starting to his feet, he exclaimed, ' Amelia, where did you hear that ?

' \" ' Strange events, Mr. Yetts, create strange moods ; ' and still my voice was cold \u2014 indeed, my heart felt like ice. \" Just then a peal of laughter rang cheerily tMough the house. \"Ah ! there is some one m the next room you do not wish me to see.' \"I darted between him and the door to Mtercept Ms passage.

I have hitherto endeavoured to illustrate the truism that \" fact is stranger than fiction,\" by the withdrawal of the curtain from my fictions, and the revelation of the facts out of which they have grown. The policy of this may be questioned\u2014 nay, has been questioned, and the general reader may not care a straw to know whether the backbone of a story be real or artificial, so long as it has a backbone. But there are a few who care to realize the verity of that which is put before them ; and there are not a few who cavil at \" sensationalism,\" and pronounce everything \" improba ble,\" which has not come within their own range of observation, and for both of these classes, and to satisfy a certain bias of my own, I pursue my own course to discriminate between fact and fable. The Watchmaker's Daughter. \u2014 A newspaper report of a peculiar case before the French Courts of Justice some fourteen or fifteen years back sug gested this tale. Ayoungmarried woman was arrested, rigorously imprisoned, and condemned to the galleys for the supposed murder of her father \u2014 whose watch was missing. The execution of the sentence was deferred until her child should be born. Meanwhile, a well-esteemed miller and two of his men broke into a farm-house, committed murder and escaped with plunder ; but one of the men had left a thumb behind, cut off in a struggle. This secured detection ; detection led to confession, and the accusation of his master, the miller. The mill contained condemnatory evidence of other crimes, and judicial questioning elicited that they were also answerable for the murder of the man whose daughter was suffering for their crime, and whose watch had been flung into the canal. The canal was dragged and the watch found. The woman was exonerated, but she had \" confessed.\" In unwinding the legal coil to set her free, the cruel process under which con fession had been extorted came to light. I have certainly not been guilty of exaggeration. The Skeletok under the Skirt. \u2014 This story was written with a purpose during the old days of crinoline. It cannot be out of place now that the \" dress question \" is coming to the front, and crinolines threaten once more to make work for the coroner. The fatal instances I have advanced were sadly true. If even one or two among the many blind votaries of fashion will take the lesson to heart it will answer its purpose. The Puritan's Will. \u2014 To this will of Henry Smith, Durham owes one of its old charities. The construction of the tale is mine, yet must I add that it is fundamentally true ; historically and topographically so ; the dramatis persoiue having lived their lives, and left their names in old records. I might say with Anthony-a-Wood, \" what toyle hath been taken, as no manthinketh, so no man believeth, but he that hath made the tryal,\" were"], [318, "306 APPENDIX it not that all such \"toy le\" is relative, and what he said of a ponderous history is scarcely applicable to a merely historical tale.

A. DOUGLAS LITHGOW, L.L.D., M.D., F.8.A., &c. [From the Manchester Examiner and Times.] The unfortunate poet, whose works are now collected, probably never dreamt that they would appear in so handsome a form, much less that a volume wonld be devoted to a record of the few miserable incidents of his most unromantic life. Born at Wigan in 1808, son of an intempeiate illiterate man, Prince was brought up in the atmosphere of poverty and distress, which enveloped him, except for short intervals, through the whole of his unhappy career, while he never fairly rose above the handi craft, reed making, which he learnt from his father. Even under such difficulties his early love of reading enabled him to educate himself, but as if his small strength of will had expended itself in his early struggles, he was never able to permanently lift himself above the mean temptations which surrounded him. There is a melancholy appropriateness in Prince's lines which Mr. Lithgow has placed on the title page of the life : \u2014 \" I might have been.\" Oh, sad suggestive words, So full of hidden meaning, yet so vain ! How sadly do they sound on memory's chords, And waken feelings of regretful pain ! I might have been a wiser, better man, With signs of well-won honour on my brow, Had I adhered to Nature's simple plan, Or reasoned with myself as I do now. True, that my life has been with ills beset \u2014 Early neglect, and poverty and gloom, \u2014 Within those shades \u2014 how well remembered yet \u2014 My mind found neither sustenance nor room ; Yet, with instinctive longing for the right, It sought for fitting food, and struggled towards the light. Among the many tragic histories of poets' lives, none could be more utterly sad than John Critchley Prince's last years, when he could no longer find sufficient employment by his reed making to keep soul and body together, and even begged postage stamps to send appeals to friends for money, and was glad to earn a few shillings by writing rhyming advertisements for an Ashton tailor. It is a marvel that during such a life, among such unsympathetic surroundings and such sordid domestic influences, so much bright and musical verse should have been written ; poetry, indeed, which gives the author so high a place among our local poets.

Richard Parkinson, D.D., Canon of Manchester, Principal of St. Bees' Theological College, and Vice-President of the Chetham Society, With a Biographical Introduction, By JOHN EVANS. From a large number of highly favourable notices by the London and provincial press, the following, from the Liverpool Daily Courier, is selected, as it presents the most salient points of interest in the present edition : \u2014 \"Though the 'homely little tale' of 'The Old Church Clock' possesses peculiar interest for Manchester men (for the Old Church referred to is, of course, that in Cottonopolis, and not that which looks over the dock quays of Liverpool), it must be found pleasurable reading by many other people even beyond the pale of the Church. Nearly 40 years have elapsed since the edifying narrative first appeared in a serial form in the ' Christian Magazine,' and over 20 years have rolled by since the author, at the age of 61 years, 'passed away quietly to his rest,' about eleven months after his paralytic seizure while preaching in the Manchester Cathedral. But ' The Old Church Clock ' has not been deprived of interest by the death of Canon Parkinson, Principal of St. Bees' College. Rather the contrary, for the new editor has prefixed to it ' An Old Church Worthy'\u2014 a biographical sketch of the late canon, who was so widely and deservedly respected and revered While the biographer has done justice to the subject, the publishers have satisfactorily fulfilled their part of the work. The volume is well printed and neatly bound, is pro- vided with a considerable number of illustrations \u2014 portraits of persons and places, a likeness of Canon Parkinson serving as frontispiece \u2014 and this circumstance increases the value of the book. An appendix provides a good deal of interesting information, and a copious index simplifies reference to special portions of the work.\" Price 1/-, boards, Micro-Fungi ; WHEN AND WHERE TO FIND THEM.

A Memoir of the days of the fight for a Free Press in England, and of the agitation for the People's Charter. By W. J. Linton. [From the Daily Telegraph, Nov. 18, 18S0.] \" 'James Watson,' by W. J. Linton, is a memoir of the fight for the ' Free Press,' published by Abel Heywood and Son, Manchester. Mr. Heywood, himself, since mayor of the great cotton metropolis, was engaged in the hard contest and a sufferer in person, and he is therefore an appropriate agent in distributing a record so honourable to a noble fore runner and comrade. ' Mr. Linton's testimony to his deceased friend carries back the public of our day to a time which though only sixty years since,' seems very remote, and though intensely real, looks dim and shadowy to those who profit by the labours of its heroes and martyrs. James Watson, who lived and fought amongst them, was one of the purest and most dis interested of the band. 'If he had not much fun in him,' writes Mr. Linton, 'no word a girl should not have heard was ever on his tongue ; his manner, though grave, was cheerful ; patient with opposition ; never querulous; considerate for others in all respects; stoutly set on his own way, but tolerant of those who went differently ; not harsh, albeit hard against tyranny and vice. Vice of himself he knew not. If ever there was a virtuous man it was he. His moral conduct was irreproachable.'\" Price is. paper wrapper, 2s. cloth, and 2s. 6d. leather.
