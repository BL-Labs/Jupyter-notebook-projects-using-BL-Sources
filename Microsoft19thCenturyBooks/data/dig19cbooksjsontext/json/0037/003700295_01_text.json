I am indebted for the minuter particulars in the life of Flora Macdonald to a little book written by a Gaelic scholar, the late Mr. Macgregor. He and his father were, in succession, ministers of the parish of Kilmuir, in which the farmhouse of Kingsbarrow was situated. He was therefore well acquainted with the locality, and familiar with its traditions. He had also known and conversed with one of Flora's granddaughters on the subject of her grandmother's adventures. My only warrant for the supposition that Flora revisited London and met Charles Edward during his visit in 1750, described by Dr. King, is drawn from a letter of Niel MacEachan's, which is still extant. In this letter, written after 1750, and addressed to his \" dear Cousin Flony,\" he plainly refers to the Prince's recent visit to England, and as strongly infers that Flora Macdonald saw him again on this occasion. I should like to allude further to the hypercriticism which has recently censured two famous works of fiction dealing with the last century and the High lands, because the author has made his characters speak Lowland Scotch. Yet, if they did not speak"], [16, "PREFACE. VI Gaelic, which is not \" understanded \" by the many, what else could they have spoken save Lowland Scotch, since they heard no other form of the Saxon tongue \u2014 shall we say?

This was true even of the higher classes accustomed* to visit Inverary, Inverness, Perth, Edinburgh, and Glasgow \u2014 even London itself on occasions. The visitors' intercourse was still almost entirely confined to the Scotch gentry and upper middle classes, speaking the modified Scotch in common use among educated Scotch men and women, a hundred years ago. In the few letters written by Flora Macdonald which have been pre served, she expresses herself as any Lowland Scotch gentlewoman would have written : she tells us that she is \"fond\" yet frightened to hear news of the absent members of her family ; she calls two of her sons \"Johnnie\" and \"Sandy,\" not \" Ian \" and \" Alaister,\" as some modern critics would have had her do.

'\u25a0' If you had been where I have been You wouldna be sae cantie.\" Old Scotch Song. On a June afternoon, a Highland girl was walking along a rough sheep-track on the east coast of one of the smaller islands of the Hebrides. Summer does not come early in these Northern latitudes. Neither the red ling nor even the purple bell heather was making any show, and the patches of oats and barley were not in the ear. Yet the vivid and varied colour- ing was the most striking attribute of the treeless landscape. The intense green of the narrow strip of cultivated land over which the moist west wind blew, was one element in the scheme of colour. Other elements were the browns, olives and grays of the moors, the pearly whites, peacock blues, shell lilacs, orange or rose reds, daffodil yellows of sky, sea, and mountain range, altering as the hours of the day altered and the clouds came and went. These were not content with sailing across the wide stretch of sky and sea, they sailed also, in substance or in shadow, over the beetling breasts and hunched backs of the mountains. And there were eyes of light hiding and B"], [22, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 2 revealing themselves, in the shape of innumerable tarns, which, like so many gleaming cairngorms ornamenting the handle of a dirk, were thickly set in every peat bog and mossy hollow of the hills. The girl, who was walking along with the firm, elastic step of one well accustomed to a hill-road, had not much attention to spare for the scenery. She went on with a preoccupied air. If she looked at anything, it was to cast an occasional quick inquiring glance at the Little Minch, the wide channel separating the Long Island from Skye. The Minch, having an unusual number of boats, smacks, cruisers whose build was discernible to sharp, practised eyes on the islands, became visible at intervals to the wayfarer. Always when she came to these favour able points of view, with which she must have been familiar beforehand, her preoccupation did not hinder her from carefully scanning the sea and its burden. Her age could have been little over twenty. Her dress was the plain neutral-tinted homespun of the country, which few summer days in the locality rendered too warm for the season. Her feathered hat and the stockings and shoes she wore were the chief marks of distinction between her dress and that of the girl who went bare-headed and bare footed, with only her plaid to shelter her from sun or rain. This better-born, better-bred country-woman might have been a daughter of one of the smaller lairds, or bigger \" tacksmen \" or tenants of the great land holders on the islands. Socially, it did not signify much to which division she belonged. The tacksmen were as \"good\" gentlemen as the lairds, to whom they were generally near of kin. The tacksmen's sons had tutors like the lairds' sons, not seldom in"], [23, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 3 company with them, and went into the army or the navy when their education was completed, in a similar fashion. The tacksmen's and smaller lairds' wives and daughters visited on terms of equality with the ladies of the great houses. Some of the poorer ladies, as in the case referred to, had also seen a little of the world. They had journeyed south as far as Glasgow or Edinburgh, had mixed in the best society of the capitals of the west and east of Scotland, and could not only play their Highland pibrochs and laments on the spinet, embroider ruffles and read a little French, they could comport themselves with all the ease and grace of the most cultivated women in the three kingdoms. It would have been impossible to mistake this girl, however simple in her dress and practical and independent in her habits, for anything else than a gentlewoman. The path she followed led round a rocky corner to a steep descent which brought her to the side of one of the brawling burns \u2014 as plentiful as the little lochs. The burn was not too deep \u2014 unless in the frequent floods \u2014 to render anything more than the row of slippery, unsteady stepping-stones necessary for crossing it. When a flood was in force the resource was about as primitive as the original means of com munication. The pedestrian either swam, took another road over the hills, or waited till the water fell. There was no one on the stepping-stones when the girl, half running, half sliding by the momentum of even her light weight and the steepness of the decline, reached the edge of the water, at which she stopped short without making any movement to cross. There was not a living creature in sight, except a kite wheeling overhead, the tail of a flock of ragged sheep looking up from their nibbling in blank surprise"], [24, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 4 and alarm at the intruder on their territory, and a group of long-maned, long-horned Highland cattle, which contented themselves with tossing the hair from their red-brown eyes and philosophically contemplating the new-comer. She, on her part, regarded them with corresponding philosophy. Among her town-bred acquirements she had not picked up an inconvenient dread of the \" stots \" and \" stirks \" which represented a great deal of the animated nature around her. She had not long to wait. Although there were no alders or saughs to serve as a lurking-place, and the only long, big blue stone was not high enough to afford a suitable shelter, yet a man, who must have been lying flat on the ground behind it, got up and came towards her. He did not take her by surprise, for her \" Good morning to you, Captain O'Neal,\" did not sound more agitated than his \" Good morning to you, Miss Macdonald.\" Yet if ever man had the air of a vagrant and vagabond who might have seen better days, but must have sunk to +he lowest depths of degradation, it was this strange specimen of a gentle man. His short coat was bleached to an indescribable colour, and worn to a thread-bare texture. Morsels of the withered grass, and flakes of the sheep's wool among which he had been lying, were sticking to it, and he had not taken the trouble to shake them off. His trews were ragged at the foot and stained at the knee. His boots were the common brogues of the country \u2014 filthy for want of cleaning, and having leather thongs in place of buckles. He had a battered cap on the head \u2014 the very hair of which was matted and unkempt, and looked as if it had not seen powder or riband for many weeks."], [25, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 5 He wore his coat buttoned up to his neck, awaken ing the suspicion that his cravat and linen, if he retained such accessories, were beyond appearing in public. He had not been shaven for several days. His skin was tanned and hardened till it might have been leather. He was as thin as a greyhound, and his eyes looked out beneath his brows with the expression of a hunted and famished animal. He was in the act of undergoing the penalty from which the warlike King of Israel shrank \u2014 choosing by preference three days of the noisome pestilence \u2014 he was fleeing for three months before his enemies. Withal, he took off his cap, and made his bow like a finished gentleman. Deplorable as his condition was, it was possible to conceive that not so very long ago, for he was still a young man, he might have been \" a pretty fellow.\" The girl who had come to meet him stepped up to him without any sign of repugnance, or apprehension, and asked with interest, in a low tone which could not be heard beyond the small area the couple occupied, \" Is all right ? What of his Royal High ness to-day?\" \" Oh, he has nothing in particular to complain of,\" answered the man, with the easy manner of a mer curial person who has come through the worst, and is therefore disposed to make the best of a lull in the misfortunes which are too general to have a special application. \" He has been diverting him self \u2014 he is not ill to divert \u2014 with the Courant and the Mercury Lady Clanranald sent him last night. His toothache has been less troublesome.\" \" Poor fellow ! \" said the girl, with a depth of single-hearted pity untinged by any other sentiment,"], [26, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 6 remarkable, under the circumstances, in a woman and a young woman. \" You see I'm doing my best to furnish him with soft eating,\" said O'Neal. And with a grin which exaggerated the boniness of his lantern jaws, he half pulled a couple of eggs out of his soiled and torn pocket. \"You must not ask too closely how they were come by, more by token that I was not far from your own brother's hen-roosts this morning. But matters cannot continue as they are.\" He suddenly lapsed into seriousness. \"I hope you understand that, Miss Flora Macdonald,\"\u2014 drawing nearer to her in his turn, and peering wistfully into the face shaded by her hat and the droop of her head. \"I have twice had to give the go-by to the soldiers \u2014 not your militia men, but the cutters' men, since morning. I hear there are more sloops of war lying off the entrances to the Minch, and that their boats are guarding every sound and loch on the coast. We're fair hemmed in, and they'll close in upon us before many more days are past. You'll do what you promised, you will not go back from your word ? You would not bring the Prince's head to the block, with ruin to the cause, and undying shame to the country, rather than risk a little venture of exposure and danger on your part ? \" \"I am not one to go back,\" she answered a little proudly. \" I will be doing what I promised. You have no reason to doubt me, Captain O'Neal. And as to its being a prince I'm seeking to save, I hope I would not be behind in trying my best for the poorest creature alive, in such mortal peril.\" \" True for you,\" replied the Irishman, adding, with native smartness of repartee, \"but while poor wretches are as plentiful as blackberries, princes in"], [27, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 7 adversity, to whom mighty crowns belong by right, are less often to be met with.\" \" I never questioned it,\" she answered with grave simplicity, \"and I trust I do not fail in what is due to such high claims as he has, for, if he is not the son of our lawful king, as some say, none can dispute that he is the grandson of our king, the last James Stuart, who reigned over this kingdom. But I would have you know, sir, that though I feel for the Prince, from the bottom of my heart, and would do anything in my power to serve him, it is quite as much to help my good old friends, Clanranald and his lady, that I'll move in this matter. They are in misery about their son, who is in jeopardy. They are likewise in sore concern for the plight of the Prince, who has thrown himself on their protection. It is to do them a kindness, and to spare them a farther weight of trouble, which is driving them doited and breaking their hearts, that I am willing to anger my brother, to bring scathe to my nearest friends, and maybe to endanger my own life and liberty, by taking the step which you profess to hold of so little account.\" He saw instantly that he had made a mistake in seeming to under-value the task required of her. \"I know,\" he said hesitatingly, and at the same time with a little gesture of despair, a quick sigh, and an impulsive throwing out of a weary arm and a sunburnt hand. \"It is a great deal, a very great deal for me and the Clanranalds to ask of any young lady, however brave and discreet. If there was any other way we could turn \" \" There is no other way,\" she said decisively, \"and you have not asked in vain. Only I would have you know that it is not a light ferlie that has been proposed to me. You spoke, moreover, Captain"], [28, "8 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" O'Neal, of black shame to the country if the Prince were taken. I do not deny it, but I would have you and him remember \u2014 though I am not saying it out of a greater grudge than I can help \u2014 that he has cost the country a deal already. I do not speak of those who have fallen fighting for his rights on the field of battle, or even of those who have suffered in the shootings and headings and hangings at Carlisle and Preston, Inverness and London. I will be thinking of the helpless women and poor men and lost bairns found dead of cold and starvation among the heather. What of the great houses that stood up for them and sheltered them \u2014 the houses of Glengarry and Kep poch and Lochiel and many another ? Burnt, stripped, and cast to the four winds.\" \" It was a great enterprise,\" said O'Neal, looking down, and crushing the pebbles with the nails in his shoes ; \" if it misgave for a time \u2014 I say for a time \u2014 there could not fail to be suffering, but it will all be made up when King James comes into his own.\" \" He means that, and he meant it all the time, no doubt,\" she admitted frankly; \"but can he bring back the dead, or build again the roof-trees that are fallen? It was from first to last no more than a bare peradventure, how bare I leave you to reckon, when he landed, not with an army or a navy at his back, but with seven gentlemen, who, though they had been the seven champions of Christendom, could have done little in their own persons to win back three kingdoms.\" Considering that O'Neal himself was one of the seven who had, with a single exception, all to gain and nothing to lose by plunging an unfortunate country, at that time in comparative peace and prosperity, into the horrors of civil war, she could"], [29, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 9 not be accused of lack of plain speaking in conducting her share of the conversation. As for the singular amount of common sense and humanity in her speech, she had spent weeks in the company of such a Whig as Duncan Forbes of Culloden, the intimate friend of her chief, Sir Alexander Macdonald, the lineal representative of the Lords of the Isles. O'Neal flushed hotly through his shrunken and weather-beaten skin. \" The Prince cast himself on the loyalty of his father's subjects ; he trusted to them entirely,\" he said stiffly. \" He did,\" said Flora, \" and they rose at his bidding, many of them. Then, when fortune failed him at Culloden, he was ready to leave them to pay the piper, and to get back to France at any price.\" \"Miss Macdonald,\" said O'Neal, passionately, \"if any man spoke to me as you are speaking, I would let him see that I had still a sword and pistols under this coat. The Prince, poor royal lad, was foremost in every march and in every encounter with the enemy. He was ready and willing to endure the greatest hardships with the poorest man in the ranks. It was not his fault, I can bear my testimony \u2014 he begged and implored, ay, he wept like a woman to those who had the ordering of the army that they should go on to London, and not beat a retreat at Derby, which was the beginning of our misfortunes. But now our back is at the wall, and even those on whose old fidelity and gentleness of heart we counted to come to our aid, are ready to turn against us.\" \" What have I said ? \" cried Flora, half bewildered, half indignant. \" I have spoken no words that should draw down a reproach like that you are casting at me and my friends. I did not lichtly the Prince's gallantry, though I blamed his recklessness. Nor do"], [30, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 10 I go with them who are ready to enter on a game and play it with spirit, so long as the sun shines and the wind is fair or moderate fair, but when the gale blows in their teeth, and the thunder and lightning and hail and the strong tide itself are all against them, will fling it up and leave who will to bear the wight, while they make their escape to wait for better times. They say, Captain O'Neal, that after Culloden the Prince had word there were as many as two thousand Highland men mustering at Ruthven, and biding his pleasure, and that instead of joining them aud playing out the game he had begun of his free will, till he compelled fortune to turn, or till he shed the last drops of his and their blood, or at least till he made terms for his followers, he sent to them to disperse, well knowing the reprisals they would have to suffer, while he took his way to the coast to hail the first French ship that might be dispatched for his rescue.\" \" I cannot tell,\" said O'Neal, with a shade of sullenness in his face and voice. \" I suppose he saw that the chance was gone, and would spare the clans from worse befalling them. It was for my Prince to judge and command ; it was for me, and the like of me, to submit and obey. But you have never seen him ; you cannot tell what a charm he has to win and keep hearts.\" The speaker's face grew eager, and his tone almost buoyant again. \" I have heard he is very bonnie, and has a pleasant tongue in his head,\" said Flora, composedly. \"I'll not deny that, woman-like, I've been fain enough to see and hear what has turned so many heads, if I had not gotten too good reasons to keep out of the stir.\" \"Ah!\" burst out O'Neal impulsively, speaking"], [31, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 11 his thoughts aloud, \" if he had but come himself and spoken with Sir Alexander and Dunvegan, in place of contenting himself with winning over young Clanranald and old Raasay, and sending messages to the others \" \"Then,\" Flora interrupted him, \"he would have been short of a refuge. It would not have mattered much, so far as I can see, to the poor gentlemen, who protested against his expedition and refused to take part in it, to whom he has come, after all, to get him out of the scrape, at their own proper peril. But, if both the Long Island and Skye had been given up to blood and fire, like the mainland, as he would have had them if he had gotten his will, where could he have found the poorest bield, or how could you or any body else have bespoken help, from a young woman like me, for a Prince like him ? \" \"You are hard upon us, Miss Macdonald,\" said O'Neal, gloomily. \" Hard words, if they be true \u2014 and the truth does not often reach the ears of princes, whether they be seated on a throne or reduced like a beggar to a midden \u2014 break no bones. Neither does it follow that they will hinder merciful deeds. I am ready to take your Prince over to Skye, sir, this very night.\" He looked up, and his face grew bright on the instant. He had not the smallest fear of her sincerity, he did not even trouble her with the effusive thanks and flattering praise, for which he had a perception that she would not care a straw. Yet, as his glance took in the figure and face before him, a sudden sense of the desperate insufficiency of the remedy for a desperate situation took possession of him, and almost tempted him to laugh aloud, in the midst of his gravity and anxiety, after his many days of"], [32, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 12 destitution and distress. Who was this deliverer on whom he and the Clanranalds were building their hopes ? He looked at her fully. She was but a slip of a girl not far advanced in her twenties. Her stature hardly reached the middle height, and she was slightly made. She was no more a dauntless Amazon with strength and skill to wield arms, than she was a powerful chieftainess with hordes of devoted clansmen at her command. She was well-born and well-bred \u2014 that went without saying \u2014 but she was of mediocre rank. She was the sister of Angus Mac donald, owning the small lairdship of Milton, the step-daughter of Hugh Macdonald, the militia captain and tacksman of Armadale, and the grand-daughter of the parish minister of South Uist \u2014 a respectable, but not an illustrious descent. Her face was not even that of an enthusiast. The complexion might be called fair, so far as the brown hair, combed back and falling in long curls on the neck and shoulders, in the fashion of the time, and the well-opened blue eyes were concerned ; but the girl's perfect health of body and mind, together with the sun and wind to which the face was freely exposed, had served to redden and embrown it well-nigh to the rich tints of a brunette. The forehead was round and prominent, so were the cheek bones, as became her nationality. The mouth was large, but with fine curves at once firm and full, and the white sound teeth were in keeping with all the other signs of youth and vigour. The chin and lower part of the face were slightly peaked, indicating the absence of any tendency to sensuousness and self-indulgence, and lending, in combination with the full forehead, the high cheek bones and the straighter lines of the mouth, a slight hardness as well as fearlessness to the comely face."], [33, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 13 The touch of hardness was counter-balanced by the candour of the steel-blue eyes and the kindliness, nay the tenderness of the mouth when its lines were relaxed. It was the face of a modest, upright girl of rare intelligence, sense, and discretion, in the middle of her simplicity \u2014 a girl who had profited by the unusual advantages she had enjoyed of coming in contact with the biggest brains, the shrewdest wits, and the most honest consciences belonging to the men with the weightiest responsibilities in the country. But it was only the face of a young countrywoman after all. As O'Neal's eyes rested upon it, and as he considered the tremendous nature of the stake \u2014 the Prince, the cause, the three kingdoms \u2014 all hanging in the balance, he cried out in an agony \u2014 \"But can you, dare you, Miss Macdonald? Are you not frightened? Better own it and draw back in time, however forlorn we are, than undertake an office that is beyond your ability, which, if you were to make a wreck of it, would be clean perdition.\" \"I am not feared,\" said Flora with an unwavering colour and unblenching eyes; \"I can try my best, and if we come to grief, I have good hopes it will not be my wyte. I have gotten my passport from my step-father, Captain Hugh, to take me and my maid, ' Betty Burke,' over to my mother's in Skye ; a good boat is sought out and six stout boatmen are bespoken, forby my cousin Niel MacEachan, the cleverest creature in these parts. He has tarried years in Paris, and can mouth French like a native, so that his Royal Highness will not want a word in the tongue he is most familiar with, to give him a hint and to cheer him. It is true,\" Flora said again reflectively and without blinking the question, \" I will be the one woman in the company of eight men,"], [34, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 14 granting the feck of them are Clanranald's men, and one is my cousin Niel, and we will be a night at sea if we are not captured or shot before morning. What will my mother say ? But if your wild Prince is not man and gentleman enough to know when to keep his distance, I think that every honest gentlewoman should have enough smeddum in her to see that no smirch can come on her good name, and to take care of herself.\" \"The Prince has always known the company he was in, madam, and he is fit to judge the depth of the obligation you will lay him under,\" said O'Neal, with hasty warmth. \" Neither do I misdoubt that you, or any young lady like you, can keep any man, be he prince or cadger, at a respectful distance, if such is your will.\" He finished with a scrape of a bow and the slightest suspicion of irony in his naturally genial tones. \"I am much obliged to you, sir,\" said Flora gravely, with a curtsey corresponding to the bow, and a little flush of colour- rising in her brown cheeks. The fact was, her words had revived associations which neither of them had any desire to recall. O'Neal, as his Prince's emissary, had visited the West of Scotland more than once before, and when dwell ing at Ormiclade, where Clanranald kept open house for all comers and goers, had, like the impressionable impulsive follow he was, made advances of love and marriage to Lady Clanranald's pet protegee, Flora Milton, which the girl, though she liked the Irishman well enough in other lights, unhesitatingly declined. In his present circumstances, love and marriage were as far removed from O'Neal as if he were already numbered with the dead, had there not been a sense"], [35, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 15 in which a hasty marriage with him would have removed even the shadow of scandal from tbe enterprise in which Flora was about to engage. This consideration had tempted O'Neal to broach the suggestion afresh, with considerable doubt of its reception, and Flora had dismissed the halting proposal instantly, with the remark that no young woman of sense and spirit would be so daunted by dread of the strife of tongues, as to be driven into a rash step for which she had no mind, and might regret for the rest of her days. That would indeed be to leap out of the frying-pan into the fire. Now O'Neal was a good-natured, easy-minded man, but it could not be looked for that two such rebuffs \u2014 slights to his vanity \u2014 would not leave a certain sore ness behind them, though the exigency of the present moment, where more than himself was concerned, was great enough to cause all personal feeling to be presently thrust out of sight. \" I will presume to recommend,\" Flora was speak ing again with sedate earnestness, \" that the unfortu nate young gentleman will not be touching the whiskey and the brandy, with which Lady Clanranald has provided him, or he embark with me to-night. What should he ken of the strength of our drink \u2014 him that's used to the light wines of France ? \" She made the apology with the fairness and forbear ance natural to her. \"He is tormented with his teeth, and plagued with that bleeding at the nose inherited from auld King James, his grandfather. He has been roaming like another Gaberlunzie-man, and fleeing like a partridge on the mountains since the month of April. He is wet, and he is weary, and trachled with tramping up hill and down dale. He can never count on a good night's rest ; he is never"], [36, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 16 free to sit down to a regular meal, if he can reckon on a meal.\" \"You may say that,\" chimed in O'Neal with eager protest, waiving aside any inference which might have been contained in the warning. \"Hard kebbock and a bit of oatmeal cake, or a lump of braxy mutton. I put it to you, are these dishes to set before a prince at all, at all? yet they're the best of our diet many a time. It was only the other day that we were right glad to catch a crab on the rocks, else he must have gone supperless to the bundle of plaids which served for his bed. And never a word of complaint from his Royal Highness, nought but a joke and a laugh to season our scanty meals.\" r \"That's right,\" said Flora, with hearty approval ; \" a merry heart is good kitchen, and who should be the foremost to suffer, and the last to murmur, but the best gentleman among you ? I am bound for Milton,\" she explained farther, \" to seek to make peace with my brother before I start, for it is ill to leave strife behind you when you are going on a hazardous errand. After that I will row myself across to Benbecula, and me and Lady Clanranald will be throng, getting ready Betty Burke's duds.\" Here her calm face, strong sweet mouth, and deep blue eyes twitched and twinkled with an overpowering sense of fun and laughter. She controlled herself the next instant, and resumed, \"As soon as the night falls we'll bring them our own selves to your cave, and the boat will be hauled up to the head of the darkest gully in the beach below.\" \"Very well, Miss Macdonald,\" said O'Neal, feeling there was no time to be lost. \" I'll attend to your directions. I trust all will go well, and that you will"], [37, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 17 be richly rewarded for your generosity and courage in siding with us at this date.\" \" Truly, sir,\" said Flora, with dry humour, \" I do not think that the Government, as by law established, would be greatly made up by having to pay thirty thousand pounds for the satisfaction of cutting off a head, which would be a loss beyond repair to the gentleman to whom it belongs, while the taking of it would raise more of what they call ' rebels ' than a score of years of cruel warfare would put down.\" \" Heaven forfend ! \" cried O'Neal; \"we'll prevent the calamity if it is in mortal men and women to stop it. My thanks are little worth having, and you would set small store on them \" he was continuing doubtfully and wistfully, when she interrupted him promptly. \"You are mistaken, Captain O'Neal. The thanks and the hand-shake of a leal man according to his light are always worth having, and will always be a pleasure to me to remember.\" She held out her uncovered hand, and he took it between his, which were more like claws in their blackness and skinniness. \"God bless you!\" he said fervently. \"You're a good woman, and a brave one, and you've kept a heart in your breast all the same.\" \" So has many a good and brave woman \u2014 if I can pretend to the title. Do not doubt it, sir, and it will help to bring to you the blessing you've been kind enough to ware on me. Good-bye, till all the dark ness we can look for on a summer night, come to befriend us.\" So the conspirators parted by the Ford, and happily for them only the sheep and the stots were the wiser for their confabulations. c"], [38, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 18 CHAPTER II. '4 The women are a' gane wud.\" Old Scotch Song. The house of Milton on South-uist was merely a roomy, thatched cottage. The island of Skye itself had but three slate-crowned houses in addition to those of Dunvegan, Monkstadt, and Armadale, which, on the principle of the old French manor-houses, called themselves castles. How should South-uist, which was even barer and bleaker than Skye, which had not so much as a knoll with feathery birches, or a plant of honeysuckle or ivy to adorn itself with, dream of being better provided in the matter of a dignified stone or slate-covering to the long, low white-washed walls of a house like that of Milton, in order to distinguish it from the \"clay biggins\" of the clachan or hamlet, which was the invariable accompaniment and dependent on the laird, or \" the tackman's \" dwelling? The mark of pre-eminence, apart from the difference in size, and from the stacks of chimneys instead of the hole in the thatch, was to be found in the garden-wall, which was solidly built of slabs of stone, in place of being composed of a succession of layers of \"turf\" or \"peat\" known as a \"seal dyke,\" liable to be dislodged, set free, and scattered to the four winds, by any one of the tempests which were seldom at rest for many days during the long winter months. This proud token of a \" walled garden \" was finished off and completed by a painted wooden gate, between two stone pillars like two corn stacks, whereas the \"cruivies,\" or cottage gardens, had nothing better than a gap in the \" seal dyke \" as an artless indication of where entrances and exits"], [39, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 19 were to be effected, by those who were not sufficiently active to step over the dyke at all points. The flowers and vegetables which the garden held in common were hardly deserving of a wall, since they were of the hardiest aad most ordinary kind, while the dilatoriness of the summer kept them from making any show of greenness and floweriness, even with the advantage of a shelter, and when it was far on in June. The currant and gooseberry bushes had done little more than unfold their leaves, and there were late pinks in the borders where a southerner might have looked for early roses. The kale and cabbage plants were moderately flourishing, and the breaks of potatoes were going to be gay with purple and white blossoms in a week or two, but that desirable attainment belonged to the future. Nevertheless, Flora, who was acquainted with more fertile gardens, looked round her with appreciation, knowing well the trouble and pains her brother Angus took to achieve even these small results. She experienced still greater satisfaction at the sight of a white pony, carrying a side saddle, which was being led along the gravel sweep to the offices behind the house. \"It will be my cousin Lorraine from Kilmossie,\" she said to herself. \" Her presence will tie Angus's tongue, and we'll part without more angry words. Eh ! but would not she be wild if she knew what I'm going to do to-night ? What would she not give to stand in my shoon ? And where would the poor Prince be, if she got her will ? \" The interior of Milton was much more comfortable and attractive than its outward appearance might have led a stranger to expect. Certainly the entrance hall, with its stag-horns, guns, and rods in a rude"], [40, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 20 enough jumble, was small and dark, and the un matted passages were very narrow, but they led to various rooms whose proportions and contents were of a highly respectable order. One room was the black-raftered kitchen, large enough to accommodate half a score of cattle-men and shepherds, a keeper or two, a dog-boy and the family piper, together with four or five servant lasses. Many a merry-making which Flora had not disdained to countenance, was held in that great farm kitchen. There was a very passable dining-room panelled with oak and supplied with oak furniture ; and there was quite a pleasant draw ing-room, or parlour, hung with Macdonald tartan, and furnished with a suite of spindle-legged satin wood chairs, settees, and cabinets, and all the knick-knacks considered necessary for the ladies' rooms of the period. The views from the small-paned windows at the opposite ends of these rooms might have struck a Lowlander as desolate in the extreme, but they were unique and magnificent in their way. The windows on one side commanded an unrivalled stretch of sky above \u2014 and beyond the border of green pasture and cornland, the gleaming waters of the Little Minch, with its changing, but for the most part familiar, freight of shipping. The windows on the other side looked inland, over a confusion of cattle sheds, sheep folds, barns and byres, taking in miles on miles of brown moorland, with its steel mirrors of \" lochans \" of every size and shape, the whole ending in the rugged range of rocky ramparts at the foot of which the great Atlantic waves broke, on the calmest day, in a long swell, with a line of surging foam. The drawing-room was Flora's room when she was"], [41, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 21 with her brother, and she went at once to it, in order to greet her cousin Lorraine, whom she found waiting for her, in company with the master of the house. Lorraine Macdonald was everything that Flora was not. The girls were nearly of an age, but Lorraine looked much the younger of the two. She was one of those women who will appear young with an unworldly, almost an unearthly youthfulness, after they ought to be grey-headed, measuring by years. Her figure was tall as well as slender, and she had an air of having outgrown her strength, while her long white throat, sloping shoulders, and \"jimp\" waist drooped and swayed with the grace of a hare bell or a willow. She was manifestly delicate, for her skin had an alabaster-like transparency, so that the gazer could trace the blue veins on hands, throat, and forehead. To add to the effect she was exceed ingly fair, with the signs of Scandinavian descent which are to be found in one portion of the inhabi tants of the Hebrides, while in another there are indications of Spanish blood. She was like those heroines of Ossian, who could be compared to snow wreaths. But the snow in Lorraine was not left a cold dead white ; there was a fire beneath it, the glow of which came and went, and kindled it with the lovely faint tints of a sea-shell, or the bright evanescent flush of a sunset. Her eyes were very large, making up by their size for the lightness of their sky-blue. They did not always look as if they saw what was before them, and they had sometimes the appearance of discerning what was invisible to the world at large, so that her better-read acquaintances were tempted to wonder whether there was a dash of the Albino in Lorraine Macdonald. If so, though her hair was of the purest flaxen, her eyebrows"], [42, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 22 and eyelashes were not only distinctly marked, they approached the nut-brown in colour, a circum stance which greatly enhanced what was undeniably dazzling in her blonde beauty. Her features were nothing to speak of, but they were sufficiently good to keep her complexion and expression in countenance. Her forehead was too high and flat \u2014 a defect accen tuated by the prevailing fashion of dressing the hair ; her nose was a trifle too long, her mouth was small with a pout, and a sensitiveness in the pout allied to weakness. The lower part of her face was peaked after the manner of Flora's \u2014 indeed the cousinly relation of the two came out in this single point of resemblance. But whereas the diminution of the cheeks and chin expressed in Flora a slight suspicion of hardness and demureness, in Lorraine it threatened to assume the transcendental attenuation of a medi\u00e6val saint. There could be no question of Lorraine Macdonald's singular beauty of colouring and moulding. In the poetically figurative language of her country, she was spoken of in the Gaelic of the lower ranks, as \"the White Beauty,\" \"the Moonbeam,\" \"the Doe of Kilmossie,\" and she held for the speakers a kind of fascination not untinged with awe. They believed to see in the fair spiritual face, and the fleshly taber nacle which was so fragile, not only a unique beauty, but the tokens of certain powers which were supposed to attend on, even to originate, the peculiar character of her looks. She was to the credulous in the lower class around her a \" Kilmeny \" who could pass at will into regions untrodden by ordinary men and women, who could dream dreams and see visions which left their reflection behind them. In the more prosaic upper circles of society in"], [43, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 23 which she moved, the members spoke the more literal, shrewd Lowland Scotch of the educated ranks in the Northern Kingdom. They were not disposed to believe in eighteenth-century marvels, while both their generation and its standard were coarse and material, under a mask of superfineness. To them Lorraine was a choice specimen of a \" divine nymph,\" \" an elegant female,\" \" a perfect gentlewoman.\" Lorraine had no great need of dress to set off her personal attractions, but in contradiction to her cousin Flora, the girl was as richly, even sumptu ously attired as the compulsory riding habit she wore would permit. The coat and skirt themselves were of the finest scarlet cloth, trimmed with gold lace. Her under vest was of cambric with the frills of Mechlin, to match the ruffles at her wrist. She wore a gold watch at her side, a solitaire set with diamonds, and jewelled rings weighing on her slim fingers. But what was most conspicuous about the splendid apparition which looked a little out of place in the Milton drawing-room, was the large white cockades worn, with a fine fatuous unconcern on the left breast of the coat, and turning up the flap of the hat. Lorraine also carried in her hand a cluster of white roses, not gathered from the hardy \" briar bush \" of a \"kale yard,\" but such as had been reared under glass at some cost and pains. Angus Macdonald gaped helplessly at the white cockades and roses. He was one in politics with his chief, Sir Alexander Macdonald, and with the Lord President Forbes. He had set his face against the rebellion, and held sternly aloof from it, from first to last. He had told his sister, when she had dutifully consulted him on the dangerous step she was about to take, that she was mad, that it was altogether"], [44, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 24 unbecoming in a woman, that never before had such an insubordinate act been attempted or accomplished. It was brazen-faced, it was disgraceful, it would cover her with infamy, and bring him to ruin, if not to the gallows. If any other person had entered Milton's house wearing the white cockade and flourishing a bunch of white roses, he would have bidden them rid them selves of the badges, or quit the place within the hour. Yet here was Lorraine Macdonald, his kins woman, a girl little better than a child to him, flaunting the obnoxious ensigns under his very nose, unrebuked and unchallenged. She did it too with the superb unconsciousness of a baby, as if she had a perfect right to make a mad fool of herself and him, like so many women of the day, not because she depended on his long-suffering, but because he was her slave still more than her suitor. He would a good deal rather have faced and contradicted Queen Caroline, who, if all tales were true, had ruled King George alike in his closet and in his council chamber, than have found fault with Lorraine Macdonald. And what was Lorraine Kilmossie ? She was but a Highland heiress of no great estate ; such as it was, she was rapidly running through it and send ing it to the dogs, in her wanton waste and folly, what with her visits to Edinburgh, and her mad project of fitting out a regiment and packing the men south after the main body of the insurgents \u2014 a most senseless, traitorous proceeding which her bailie, honest man, stopped with the greatest diffi culty. In similar unwarrantable style was the pre posterous finery of her dress and equipments, which would have \"set Lady Marget,\" or Macallummore's lady herself, but was totally out of place in a young,"], [45, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 25 unmarried woman \u2014 a little Highland girl who had not so many hundreds of acres of moorland and scores of nowt and sheep for her portion. No doubt her bravery agreed well with her wonderful beauty and winsomeness ; and her cousin, the widow woman Mrs. Macdonald of Uig, who was supposed not merely to live with Lorraine, and bear her company in her house of Kilmossie, but to take charge of the bairn and keep her within bounds, had no more power to restrain her in her cantrips than to fathom Corrie vreckan. Milton was a thick-set, shock-headed man, nearly twenty years the senior of his sister Flora and their cousin Lorraine. His bare brown hairy knees, re calling the knees of a bull, and his stalwart slouched shoulders made him a worthy descendant of his grandfather, \" the strong minister.\" His full moon of a face was extensively freckled, and his red-brown eyes had curiously heavy lids. Milton had lived too long the life of a bachelor to be pliable in his temper and ways, and as decorous in his habits as could be wished. His coat and kilt of Macdonald tartan, though in excellent condition when contrasted with poor O'Neal's wretched habili ments, were shabby in themselves and carelessly put on. He snuffed, smoked, and drank, not more than his neighbours, but more than was good for him. He was not singular either in smoking his pipe and drinking his glass of toddy in the kitchen, among his humble relations (for every Macdonald among them was of his clan and race) instead of in his dining-room \u2014 empty when he had no company of his own class. But the custom had a double tendency to increase his despotic turn of mind, and to lend a certain roughness and recklessness to habits"], [46, "26 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" which were then regarded as perfectly permissible \u2014 more than that, which were all but universal. Withal, Angus Macdonald of Milton was held in high respect for the integrity of a gentleman, and for a canniness or caution in forming and carrying out a resolution, which was in itself a welcome assurance of sagacity and trustworthiness. He was also esteemed for his knowledge of cattle and his skill in dealing with them, and for a commendable liking for orderly management and propriety of behaviour where his surroundings and retainers were concerned. He might be slovenly in his dress, and careless and rude in his manners, but he would have no neglected house and garden, no ill-kept barns and byres, no disorderly crew about him. It did not detract from the value his neighbours set upon him that his temper was known to be as \" stiff \" as his mind was honourable and his affections warm. Flora was fond of her elder brother, and he was fond of her in return, but she had no more influence over him than younger sisters have, as a rule, over elder brothers of his type ; while Lorraine could have turned him with a straw and wound him round her little finger if she had felt the slightest inclination to exert her power. His infatuation was a great con venience to Flora in the present instance, but for the most part she regretted it still more than it tickled her. Poor Milton ! it gave him many a sore heart and sorry moment. It made him look like a satyr or a Caliban in Lorraine's presence. It kept him from getting the wife he needed. A pretty like wife Lorraine would make for him were he to get his heart's desire ! There would be a fine account of the wool-spinning and the cheese-making if Lorraine were ever to be mistress at Milton. Flora could not"], [47, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 27 think what Angus could see in Lorraine to seek her for a wife. It was not that Flora did not like her cousin as a cousin, but as a wife, one of the heads of a house, a man's closest companion for good and for ill, for the term of his life \u2014 it was waesome to think of her. She was the bonniest of the bonnie, but that was far from the heart of the thing. The creature was very lovable in her freaks and fancies, but she was \" silly\" in more senses than one, and spoilt for being the partner of any sensible man, and she would no more look at Milton in the light of a goodman than she would look at a bent broom, or a rung of a stick, brought over from the mainland. Lorraine was not long in approaching the subject with which her mind was full. \" And what are the last tidings of the Prince ? When was he latest heard of? On whose lands and in whose house is he lying, honouring them by his presence ? \" she plied Flora with questions, sitting up in her chair, and breathing quickly in her eagerness. \"How should I tell?\" answered Flora, drawing out a tea-table drawer, and taking from it a muslin apron that she might wear it in making tea for the genteel meal of \"four hours\" \u2014 revived in recent days. Angus groaned audibly, but Flora had no fear of his betraying her. Sooner than drag Lorraine into the shadow of a scrape, he would be a dumb dog for the rest of his days, and suffer Flora to proclaim King James for a second time in Moidart, and march, armed with dirk and claymore, like another Joan of Arc, to restore life to a lost cause. Flora could take care of herself, Lorraine wanted all the protection which men or angels could afford her. \" I thought you might have heard.

I came here on purpose to hear,\" said Lorraine, sinking back in her chair with a deep sigh of disappointment, that caused Milton to groan afresh. \" Do you suppose he can have broken through the cordon of ships and boats, gotten on board a French vessel, and left Cumberland to whistle on his butcher's thoomb ? \" \" The sooner the better for him if he has,\" said Flora. \" If he has not, he is not taken yet, I can say that \u2014 nor will he be, if faithful friends and common humanity will serve his turn,\" she finished in a lower tone, while her brother gloomed at her, from his corner, for affording even so much intelligence and encouragement to the infatuated inquirer. \"May wind and water do their best for his Royal Highness,\" said Lorraine, clasping her hands with the slender fingers and filbert-shaped nails, and speak ing in profound earnest, as if she were the most artlessly devout of worshippers invoking her patron saint. \"May he step on French soil, dry-shod, and without a hair of his bonnie royal head turned.\" \" And when he's back among the foreign cattle he and his like have come from, may he have the gumption to stay there,\" mumbled Milton, twirling the broad thumbs which Lorraine might have had in her eye when she spoke of the butcher thumbs of Cumberland. She did not vouchsafe him a word, or a look in direct reply, but she answered him indirectly when she spoke again in a clear voice of wistful longing, \" He will come back, he'll never leave us bereft, after we've basked in the grace of his countenance. Oh ! we'll work and pray, and never rest till he sail once"], [49, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 29 more across the water to take his own. Flora, what did you mean by such unworthy words as ' common humanity ' ? It is our heart's allegiance he is entitled to.

There is not a woman in Scotland who would not sell the rings from her fingers, and the shoon from her feet, if it would do him any good.\" \"Yes,\" said Flora, half under her breath, \"now that he is a wanderer with a price set on his head.\" \" Your Sir Alexander, your Lord of the Isles,\" went on Lorraine without heeding her cousin, be stowing Sir Alexander specially on Flora, because of her close connection with Skye through her mother and her mother's second husband, Captain Hugh of Armadale, \" he may demean himself to stay with Cumberland at Inverness, and keep off suspicion from his house, but what part does his lady, my Lady Marget \u2014 a blessing on her Eglintoun beauty and stateliness \u2014 play in the islands when his back is turned ? That of protectress to the Prince, writing to him under her own hand and seal, and telling him beforehand which places to shelter in, and which to shun. Everybody knows what was done by the Lady of Moy, though the Mackintosh himself is a rank Hanoverian. Did not she cause the roads to be patrolled, though by not more than six men \u2014 all who came to her hand, and they fired off their guns and shouted the clan slogans, till they cost Loudun a panic, and tempted him to lead the rout back to the town. The very lassie in the change-house whipped out when she had a guess who the soldiers were after, and ran miles in the dark, to give the alarm. As for me, if I could but learn where my"], [50, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 30 Prince is hiding, and convey to him all the silver plate and feather beds, and fine bed and table linen, and all the white bread, and cream cheese, and heather-honey within the walls of Kilmossie, in order to make him and his gentlemen more comfortable for the time, I would be a proud woman. I would lie on bare boards, and sup parritch for the rest of my days, and be thankful.\" \" It would be a grand plan for leading the red coats to the gentlemen's den,\" said Flora, quietly. \" When princes and their courtiers are fugitives, they must even be content to fare like other banned and hunted men.\" \" The man should be master in his own house,\" growled Angus. He had not reached beyond the earlier point in discussion, and now expressed his feelings in an incontrovertible proposition. \" And I have never heard that Scotchmen are less the masters than their neighbours,\" said Flora, while she opened her cabinet and set out the small china cups and the tea-caddy, too precious to be committed to the care of even the oldest, most confidential servant. \" Neither am I aware of great warfare in these divided households, either before or after the rising. I'm doubtful, there's some two-facedness in the transaction, like the plan followed by old Raasay and others, when they went out or stayed in, and made their sons do the reverse to keep a claim on both sides. It was artful, but the poor gentlemen were in a hole.\" \"Fy, for shame, Flora! \" Lorraine reproached her cousin indignantly. \" How can you be so suspicious, so ready to look out for base motives ? You would not have a body risk a brass farthing for king and country.\""], [51, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 31 \"Would I not?\" asked Flora, with a depth of meaning in her intonation which Lorraine was slow to perceive, and with the smile which lit up her face like a flash of sunshine. Then Lorraine launched out on the theme of which she never wearied \u2014 all that had happened on that unapproachable visit of hers to Edinburgh, during which the Prince and his army had arrived in the capital, and Charles Stuart had taken up his quarters in the palace of his ancestors. She had witnessed the glorious ride down the Canongate when the Jacobites had filled the streets, and every window in the tall \" lands \" had been thronged with exultant adherents of the Royal Stuarts, while the idol of the hour had to take his way on horseback, that he might be the better seen by his father's loyal subjects. Lorraine had attended the historic ball at Holyrood, been presented to the Prince and spoken to by him at greater length than her social pretensions quite warranted, but according to a fashion of reckoning which was easily enough comprehended when a gallant young prince and the most noted beauty in the Long Island were in question. As Lorraine expatiated on her good fortune, she flung back her lovely head with its child's fair curls, and tilted up that fine little chin of hers, which was not yet too sharp, while the blush roses in her cheeks burned for a moment with a brilliance which sur passed the poppy red looking through Flora's embrowned skin. It was hard for Angus Macdonald to contemplate Lorraine's delight in which he had no share, and he fidgeted and emitted inarticulate sounds which no doubt were disconcerting to her high-flown eloquence,"], [52, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 32 till suddenly she faced round and blazed out upon him, with the resentful remonstrance \u2014 \" Milton, if you are going to sit and grumph there at me, as all the acknowledgment of my pretty stories, I think I had better bring them to an end, bid Callum fetch out my pony, and take the road, leaving Flora and you to a two-handed crack. If she can put up with your ill manners, it is more than I can or will, after I've been accustomed to very different treatment.\" \" No, no, Lorraine,\" said the poor laird, getting up slowly and clumsily, and shaking himself discon solately; \"if anybody is to take their foot in their hand, it had better be me, who am not fit company, it seems, for a fine young madam who has been consorting with a polished blade of the first quality, no less, be he prince or pretender.\" \"Do not disagree, you two,\" urged Flora, well enough accustomed, in spite of Milton's devotion, to the bickerings and retorts which passed be tween the ill-suited pair. \" You'll wait for a dish of tea, Angus ; Babby will be here with the kettle when it comes a-boil. No ? Then, Lorraine, if you do not approve of his manners can you not let them a-be, in his own house and he old enough to be your father ? Not that he would thank me for reminding you of his advantage in that respect,\" she ended with comical ruefulness, as she listened to her brother's heavy footsteps in resolute retreat."], [53, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 33 CHAPTER III. \" I see a hand you cannot see.\" Old Ballad. Lorraine had the grace to say with some con trition \u2014 \" I'm afraid I've been the ruder of the two of us. I should have minded that Milton was your brother, as well as my cousin.\" \" Poor Angus ! \" cried Flora. \" But you'll allow he can be very provoking. Pretender indeed ! As if I would speak civilly to him for months to come, after he had been guilty of such an insult to my Prince. We can tell our tales better without him throwing all his muckle weight on his chair, and creaking it in time to his grumphing.\" Lorraine settled her light figure more luxuriously in the corner of the settee, till a fresh idea crossed her mind. \"Flora, you might ride back with me to Kilmossie and spend the night there. I'll show you the Royal Stuart ribands I wore tying back my hair, and hang- ing from the shoulders of my white silk sacque, that night at Holyrood. If you speak me fair, I may even let you have a glimpse of the very white rose he took out of his breast and presented to me with his own royal hand. It's wallied and shrivelled now, and I've some trouble to preen the falling leaves together, to keep them from dropping, one by one, every time I look at it. But I'll preserve it to my dying day, for the sake of my lord, the future king.\" \" I cannot do what you want, Lorraine, for I'm D"], [54, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 34 bound on another errand.\" Flora made an almost imperceptible pause. \" I'm to sup at Ormiclade,\" she continued quickly, \"and go afterwards on what is more the Clanranalds' business than mine. I could not go with you, even for the sight of your rose, which is wallied and shrivelled already, you say.\" \" What would you have ? \" demanded Lorraine in perplexity. \"It is going on ten months since that happy night. If I had not tied the stalk with silk, and put the flower between the leaves of my Bible, it would have been all to pieces, and swept away as rubbish lang syne.\" \" But you've kept it,\" said Flora, \" and you'll still keep it \u2014 not to your dying day, maybe, but till you get another lord and king to rule over you; and then, why, then it may depend on his will and pleasure, whether you set such store on the relic.\" \" Me have another king ! \" exclaimed Lorraine, quivering with excitement. \" Never, never ! And if you mean a man \u2014 a husband \u2014 Flora Milton, I tell you that I'll wed with no mortal man who is not Prince Charles's sworn faithful servant. 'Deed, I do not think I'll marry at all, till I see my Prince seated on his father's throne. I would like to tarry a maid for his sake, and to let the kiss which he set as a seal on my cheek, in return for the kiss I gladly gave his hand, be the only salute that shall leave its mark there thenceforth. You ken it was his privilege to kiss the ladies among his friends, and if he exercised it pretty freely when the ladies were young, and I may say bonnie, it was what might have been looked for,\" declared Lorraine, with her head up in the air in defiance of any disapproval on Flora's part. \" What the worse were we ? Instead of that we were a deal the richer for the Prince's salute.\""], [55, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 35 \" Lucky ladies ! \" said Flora, \" and the number of you prevented any invidious remarks, for you're aware, I dare say, that your Prince has not the best of characters with women.\" \" He's everything a prince should be,\" insisted Lorraine. \"Oh yes! if a prince has carte blanche to follow every woman that takes his fancy and ruin her, supposing she does not object, and has no higher law than his pleasure. But my grandfather was a godly minister of the kirk, you must mind, Lorraine. As for my brother, Milton, whom you've just sent to the rightabout, because he could not clear his throat to please you, he may be but a plain carle, all the same he's a man and a gentleman every inch of him. Angus Macdonald never harmed a woman so much as in thought, since he was born. It is not the way of the world, and it is not the way of the Country, the more's the pity ; but it will be the right way, and the way we will have wished to have walked in, when we lie down on our dying beds.\" \" Houts ! it is a long step to our dying beds,\" said Lorraine, flippantly. \" That may be, though I cannot say I've your assurance,\" said Flora, still speaking seriously. \" Flora, woman, what ails you ! \" remonstrated Lorraine, wonderingly. \"I cannot make you out the day. Has a goose gone over your grave ? You're the picture of health, compared to a white-faced thing like me.\" \" That may be,\" repeated Flora, \" but it does not follow that I'm destined for a long life.\" \"Is it your wraith that you have seen?\" asked Lorraine, startled at last, bending forward and let ting her voice fall into an awed whisper. \"But"], [56, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 36 no\" \u2014 she raised it again the next instant, with the grain of shrewdness which mingled with what was fantastic in her simplicity \u2014 \"you're not to take my trade over my head ; one in the family is enough.\" \"More than enough,\" said Flora, shaking his head, while she smiled reassuringly. Just then Babby with her bare head, bare feet, and spotless white apron, entering with the kettle and placing it on the tea-tray, effected a diversion in the conversation. Not that Lorraine took it far afield ; she brought it back, indeed, to the person who had had the misfortune to offend her, for whom Flora had stood up. \" Milton is just Milton, a very worthy gentleman, and a more than ordinary kind kinsman, I don't deny it ; and, as you say,\" she added, mischievously, with a toss of her long fair hair, \"he's old enough to be my father.\" \"You'll keep the peace with poor Milton,\" said Flora, with more wistfulness of entreaty than any thing in the conversation explained, \" and you'll make no rash vows either on your own behalf, or on that of the Prince.\" She stopped as Babby reap peared with supplies of white bread, scones, butter, cream, honey and \"diet loaf\" for the tea. While the cousins were drinking tea, Flora began to banter Lorraine in a lighter tone. \" How could I have ridden with you to Kilmossie as you proposed ? How could I have gone with such an elegant lady ? A pretty-like figure I would have made beside her,\" and she looked down with amusement at her home spun gown. \" Oh, everybody knows who you are, and every body sets store on you, whether you're here at Milton, or over at Ormiclade, or away at Armadale,"], [57, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 37 or even with Lady Marget at Monkstadt,\" said Lorraine, making her excuses a little lamely. \"But for me, I'm nobody without my fine feathers. I'm not everybody's body, and I'm not strong \u2014 the doctor and Mrs. Macdonald, my Mrs. Macdonald, they say that, so that I cannot be of much use in the world. And think you now it would be fit that I, who have seen a court at Holyrood and have promised to carry my rose \u2014 all that is left of it \u2014 to St. James's, would it be fit, I say, that I, who have been distinguished by my Prince's notice, should made no difference in my dress and bearing, out of compliment to his condescension, but should just go about like an ordinary country girl, fresh from her wheel, or from watching the cows milking in the fauld ? \" \" You've settled that question for yourself \u2014 you are your own mistress, you can do as you will,\" said Flora, satisfied that Lorraine would take her way. The concession had the usual result, for if Lorraine did not abate her pretensions, but rather extended them in another direction, she qualified them. \" I wish you could have come back with me to Kilmossie,\" she said coaxingly. \"Mrs. Macdonald is getting very dull of hearing, and it is some lonesome for me at home all alone at nights. Do you know, Flora Milton, I've been seeing strange sights and hearing unco sounds again? \" The girl gave an involuntary shiver and glance over her shoulder, while her face, which so lately had been full of enthusiasm and of laughter, grew wan and shadowy on the instant, and she rose and took a stool close to Flora. Flora gave a responsive shiver, for though she had known towns, she had dwelt for the most part in the wilderness, in the solemn shadow of the mountains,"], [58, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 38 with the screech or the wail of the wind, and the fierce roar or the unresting moan of the sea and the hillside torrents for ever in her ears. The superstitious Celtic blood was in her veins as well as in Lorraine's. \"What are you seeing and hearing?\" she asked breathlessly ; and then she checked herself, and, like the practical, sensible girl she was, sought to give her cousin good advice. \"You should not hang about the doors and the windows by yourself \u2014 not even at home on the long summer nights. If you meet with nothing worse you'll catch your death of cold. You might take a game at draughts, or at ' the Tod and the Lambs,' with Mrs. Macdonald, poor body ! it would serve to divert you both.\" \"I've seen him again,\" said Lorraine, low \"and tremulously, without showing the slightest inclination to profit by her companion's recommendation. Flora could not restrain a great start. \"Where? When ? Mind what you're saying, Lorraine,\" she cried sharply, \"for if we're meaning the same person, his strait is great, greater than I dreamt, if he has been mad enough to go about exposing himself to all and sundry.\" \"I am minding,\" said Lorraine, too much en grossed with what was in her mind to resent Flora's words, \"and you need not be frightened, for it was not abroad I saw him, it was in my own parlour, when Mrs. Macdonald had left me by myself for half an hour, in the gloaming, to go and see a girl she had trysted to come up and speak with her about the parlour-maid's place, after Mary Beg is married. And he was not in the body, he was in the spirit ; and he was not as he is now, but as he will be,"], [59, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 39 according to what has befallen him after long years.\" \" That sounds as if he were to live to grow auld,\" said Flora, reflectively, and at the same time speak ing with alacrity ; \" and how did he look, and in what guise was he ? \" \" He looked auld, auld and broken down,\" answered Lorraine, sadly, in the same hushed far-away voice, \"yet his hair was not that gray or his body that bent with age. His face was more swelled than lined, and his body was rather unwieldy than shrunken. There were great bags below his bonnie blue een, and the een themselves were blood-hsot as his puffed face was yellow, where it was not streaked with dull crimson. His hand shook like an aspen leaf, as he ettled to play a measure on a phantom fiddle he held in his arms. Oh, Flora, could it be the cares of royalty and the burden of a crown which could so change and wreck him ? If so, he was not in his own palace of Holyrood, nor I think at St. James's from what I've heard. For, instead of a park with trees, there were gardens with evergreen bushes and marble figures, such as I've seen in pictures, on the terrace below the window where he stood, and up and down the long gallery strolled and pranced outlandish figures in velvet coats, and silk knee-breeches, with hair on their lips and chins. There was not a Highland face or a Highland kilt among them, though there was a muckle man in a petticoat like a woman's, with red shoes peeping from beneath it. I saw all that, as plain as I see you, before the whole scene vanished like a flash.\" \" And what happened then ? \" inquired Flora, with a gasp. \" Nothing ; Mrs. Macdonald found me in a dwam,"], [60, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 40 or a trance, when she came back, and she hurried me off to bed as soon as she could bring me round, and set me to swallow a glass of white wine negus.\" \" She was right,\" said Flora, drawing a long breath, \" more right than I am to sit listening to you and putting fancies into your head.\" \" You put no fancies into my head. It is me and not you who sees visions,\" Lorraine corrected her cousin emphatically. She betrayed a little pique, and a disposition not to be deprived of the distinction of her gift, though her teeth chattered a little at this very moment, because of its eeriness. \" I'll not tell you if you do not care to hear ; but night after night, well-nigh, I see and hear that liehted-up glass coach, which nobody else sees or hears, driving up to the door. It is always filled with all manner of company. I can see most of my friends and acquaintances, and I can often pick out you and Milton among them, and I've noticed the Clan ranalds, and the lads and lasses from Boisdale, and many more, hereabouts, forby people I knew in Edinburgh. The coach comes up with a great clatter of hoofs and wheels, tongues and laughter, and it stops'while the company come out. After a time I hear it returning in dead silence, but for the rumble of the wheels and the thud of the horses' feet \u2014 for all they are going back at a walking pace. Every licht is out, and it is black, black, only I can see inside that the coach is empty. There was just one night it held a figure \u2014 straiket out stiff, so that I could not see head or face \u2014 and that was the evening of the day on which poor Prinlaws suffered at Preston.\" \"Whisht ! whisht ! \" said Flora, compelling herself to speak in the name of common sense and reason, while the Ups of the other girl were waxing blue, and"], [61, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 41 her great pale eyes were growing glassy as she spoke. \" You should not give way to such daft-like notions ; you heard beforehand Prinlaws was to suffer, and your head was full of him.\" \" It was no mere notion,\" argued Lorraine, stubbornly, \" and you cannot but believe, Flora Milton, that there are folk who see double and treble what is before them, what is happening elsewhere, and what is to come to pass. They see what is beyond mortal sicht, not only when they're alone, but also when they're speaking and doing things like their neighbours. There was Eppie of the Bothie, she was peeling potatoes beside her dochter, when she cried out that she had a glaum of her two grand children lying with a snaw-drift for their shroud. Sure enough there was an onding of snow, and they were lost on the hillside. You do not disbelieve in spirits, surely, for that would be worse than an infidel, and you the grand-dochter of a minister, and a very good woman who is never absent from the Tables ? \" \"Yes, I believe in spirits,\" said Flora, with calm conviction ; \" it is then- appearance to their neighbours in the body which is uncertain. When it is to some purpose I am ready to give it credit, but when it can only send them near out of their wits, or fair fell them with fricht, I confess I cannot see the good of it. As for what happens in trances I will not venture to speak,\" she went on modestly, \"since I was never in a trance myself ; but we've the word of an apostle that such conditions of soul and body have existed. Still, Lorraine, as you and me are far enough from apostles whatever, and are at best ignorant young girls with all our lives before us, if I were you I would try to be like other folk, and confine myself to the"], [62, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 42 affairs of this world, so long as my business was here.\" \"I'm sure I don't want to be unlike other folk,\" protested Lorraine, with a mixture of querulousness and plaintiveness. \" It is by no doings of mine that I've the word of seeing further than the rest of the world. It is a plague rather than a pleasure to me, I can tell you, to have men and women coming and speering to speak with me. Then they will be saying, ' Miss Lorraine Macdonald,' or ' Lorraine, daughter of Kenneth,' as the case may be, ' will you be doing us a favour ? Will you take a message from us to our father who died come Martinmas twelvemonth ? Will you be saying that we're agreed at last on who is to have the cruivie, and who is to have the boating tackle.' Or, ' Will you find out for us which of the two places \u2014 the gude or the bad, poor Murdie went straight to when he was drowned in Wednesday's gale and him in liquor, though he had been as sober as a judge for months before, save when he was engaged at the herring curing, and a dram was a needcessity.' \" \"They're in the hands of a God of justice and mercy,\" said Flora, reverently, as if she had been her grandfather, \"the strong minister.\" \"Tell them to be content with that ; but they want an earthly witness, they seek a sign, and no sign will be given them.\" \" But a gift is a gift, there's no denying that, however much trouble it may cost you.\" Lorraine stood up for the dignity of her strange inheritance. \"I never pretended it was an honour to possess it. A bairn may have it, very often it is the portion of the most donnert auld man or the most doited auld wife in the clachan. But it is there, make what you like"], [63, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 43 of it ; and it comes and goes when it lists, while you can no more put it from you, or refuse to see or hear ought save what the feck of your fellow-creatures see and hear, than you can shut your eyes and deny that the sun or the moon is in the lift, when you feel it shining upon you all the time, and thrilling the very bluid in your veins.\" \" Well-a-day, it is your weird, not mine,\" granted Flora ; \" but say your prayers, Lorraine, lassie, when the fit is on you, if you can, and be all the better a woman for your gift, if so be you have a gift. Now, if you please, we'll wash up the tea-things and put them by safe in the aumry, before you mount your pony, or I start for my walk and my row across to Benbecula.\" Flora's fingers were in the china bowl in which she was rinsing the cups and saucers, while the fine table napkin with which she was to dry them was hanging over her arm, when she paused in her operations, and looking another way said abruptly, \"Did you ever see him in the coach ? \" \"That have I,\" answered Lorraine without hesi taion, \" many a time, when it was all lit up and ringing with merriment. It was as the handsome young man, the gallant young Prince I saw at Holy rood \u2014 not as he looked when I beheld him the other nicht that he was visible to me.\" There was a manifest shrinking in her emotional face and voice, from the image she had conjured up, in contrast to the reality. \" Was he never straikit like Prinlaws, or what you thought Prinlaws in the black coach ? \" \" No, never.\" \" Did you see the thing last night again ? \" \" I did that, Flora.\""], [64, "\"THE .MACDONALD LASS.\" 44 \" And he was not there nor any other body ? ' \" It went away as empty as ever.\" \"That was well, I'm glad to hear that,\" said Flora, in an accent of relief, \" though I'm a fool to be minding and paying heed to what is little better than dreams. I'll tell you why I'm glad some other day, Lorraine, when we've plenty of time and are at liberty to talk over other people's business.\" CHAPTER IV. '\u2022 And where was't that your Prince lay doon, Whose hame should been a palace?\" Glen. That night Flora formed one of a small party who stole out of the house of Ormiclade after it was dusk, and took their way to Rossinish, where in one of the recesses or caves common enough on these coasts, Prince Charles Stuart was lurking. The distance was considerable, though it could hardly have been even half the length it has been sometimes represented. Old Clanranald was not one of the group. He dared not be seen on this occasion, though the honest gentleman had followed the example of his brother Boisdale, and, under the pretence of going out shoot ing, had visited the Prince repeatedly. These visits dated from the time when, to the consternation of the Macdonalds of the Islands, they learned that the royal prey, instead of being already halfway to France, as they had devoutly trusted, had been compelled to double like a hare or a fox on his traces, and was lying in the Forest House, a shoot ing hut of Clanranald's, in the wilds of Glen Corrodale."], [65, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 45 Lady Clanranald was of the walking party, though she was neither young nor active in her habits. She had recovered from the first shock of the evil tidings that the fugitive was amongst them, when she had sat weeping in her armchair, and crying that the family were ruined and undone. Her mother's heart had been touched ; she had thought of her son who had risen with the rest of the clan on the mainland, and was likely to be an exile from Ormiclade for many a day. She remembered how he had been won over, heart and soul, to this other young man, whose irresistible charm she was to feel in her turn, when she stole with Clanranald to see what the niuch talked-of prince was like. Between tender associ ations with her son, and the royal Stuart fascination which stretched back to the days of the gentle King Jamies, she had succumbed to the personal contact. She thought of nothing now, save of serving him, and providing him with every comfort and dainty, fit for the representative of a race of kings, which she could procure on short notice, and at the height of risk. As a climax, she \u2014 a stout, elderly matron, unaccus tomed to be out of doors at night, exposed to inclement weather, was stumbling along, shrouded in a maud or shepherd's plaid which told no tales of the rank of the wearer, traversing a rough country road, under a downpour of rain. For this, and for the absence of a bright moon or twinkling stars, she was simply thankful for the sake of the princely \" loon \" of whom she was bent on seeing the last. The poor lady, exhausted in spite of her zeal, was clinging to the arm of her young friend Flora, who now wore a tartan riding-habit, the usual travelling dress of the Highland ladies of her day. Lady Clanranald talked straight on, when her"], [66, "46 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" failing breath would let her, preparing Flora for the great introduction in store for her, and giving the girl good advice, since the speaker was a worthy soul, the mother of daughters of her own. She was also fond of Flora, who had been brought up to some extent with the Clanranald girls, so that their mother had known her from childhood. Yet she was leading her to the mouth of the lion's den, never doubting that it was Flora's bounden duty and privilege to be a ransom alike for the house of Clanranald and for an unfortunate gentleman. \" You're prettily behaved, Flora, my dear, I'm glad to say, since me and Lady Marget, over at Monkstadt, had something to do with the framing of your manners, but you'll be very guarded in your bearing to his Royal Highness, since he is a fine young Prince, who may be our king some day. He has another standard and other fashions from ours. You, though of gentle birth and breeding, and a very nice-looking young girl whatever \u2014 I may say that much without flattery \u2014 are like to be of low degree in his eyes, compared to him.\" \" My dear madam,\" replied Flora, with respectful firmness, \" I'm not minding what my degree may seem to him. I can only see him in one light, and it is that of a poor gallant young lad such as my brother Ranald, whom I only know by hearsay, might have been, when he burst the blood-vessel, rowing his boat against a stormy sea. There is a ten times worse storm raging round the Prince than Ranald had to meet and die conquering. This other lad is all but in the clutches of his enemies, and in such deadly peril of his life, as he can never overcome without foreign aid. If I did not see him in this light, I crave leave to say, I do not think that even"], [67, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 47 for my best friends, not even for you and Clanranald, I could risk my neck \u2014 of little value as it may be \u2014 and blight the prospects of my opening days.\" \" For gude sake, do not speak of your neck, Flora,\" cried the lady in vehement protest; \"it is in no manner of danger. As for your prospects, it will be our business to look after them in future.\" The third person in the trio was Niel MacEachan, a Jack-of-all-trades, a nondescript in character and position, without whom, however, the enterprise would have had little chance of success. He was a Mac donald, like the rest of them, but he belonged to a decried and degraded branch of the clan, which, for some reason known only to themselves, was not held deserving of name or notice, MacEachan signifying merely the son of Eachan or Hector. For this reason nobody had seen any indignity in Niel's going over to France, and acting for a period of years as body servant or valet to Macdonnel, the Jacobite banker in Paris, who was in the heart of the Jacobite plots, and was the trusted emissary between St. Germains and the Scotch Highlands. Niel became an emissary in his turn ; his knowledge of French, which natural ability and a favourable opportunity had enabled him to master, along with many other equally available attainments, served him in good stead in this respect. He could do anything and everything belonging to the different phases of his existence, and to the debatable rank he occupied. He could play piquet to perfection, and he could pluck fowls with a quick ness and neatness which might have won a wager. When he was on the Long Island or in Paris he sat sometimes at the table of the master of the house, and sometimes at that of the servants. In either case his manners were irreproachable in their harmony"], [68, "48 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" with his seat for the moment. What was more wonderful still, he managed to be popular in all classes, and to excite no jealous enmity, whether he consorted with masters and mistresses, or men and maids. He neither provoked nor drew down upon himself, without provocation, a charge of self-seeking and time-serving, yet he always fell on his feet what- ever reverses his party's fortunes sustained. He and he alone came out of a desperate cause, a more prosperous man than when he entered it, bequeathing to his son and his son's son possibilities of worldly honour and renown. He had something of the gypsies in his bodily and mental type. He had their subtlety of brain and their litheness of body, while his brown, hairless face had its share of the delicate beauty which distinguishes many members of the Romany race. His age was probably five and thirty, and his frame was sinewy and agile, so agile that it seemed as if the light rapid movements of the Frenchmen among whom he had tarried were grafted on the dignified nonchalance and vis inerti\u00e6 of the native Highlander stalking along in his waving tartans with impassive deliberation. MacEachan's dress was the shooting dress of the men around him, whether lairds, tacksmen, or gillies. The only difference lay in the quality of cloth and tartan, hose and sporran, and the plainness or com parative costliness of dirk and gun, when such were worn. Niel's coat, kilt, and accoutrements were nearer in quality to those of the boatmen, game keepers, and shepherds than to those of their masters ; while the articles were distinguished by a good fit, cleanness, wholeness and a general propriety in wearing them, which rendered him not unfit to present himself in any circle."], [69, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 49 Niel MacEachan walked alongside of the ladies and at the same time carried a bundle with the contents of which they were well acquainted. O'Neal met the wayfarers a few yards from a rock and rush-strewn hillside sloping down to the sea shore. It was cumbered (perhaps as marking an old coast line) with many boulders \u2014 some of them of considerable size, among which were various holes, large and small, hidden by the bracken. In these rabbits burrowed and island goats and their kids found refuge, with their place occasionally taken by a fox and her cubs, or by such gentlemen dealing in the contraband trade as found the situation con- venient for the disposal of a cargo of smuggled goods. No more wind-swept, desolate spot on a night which threatened to be one of tempest, could be found in the three kingdoms. O'Neal had been to the shore to see if the boat was in readiness. He had also been keeping a look-out in an irregular fashion, which was not calculated to attract attention, for never had Prince a more tatter demalion sentinel, or one more likely to be mistaken for a prowler after small game on his own account. \"Eh, I'm blythe to see you, Captain,\" panted Lady Clanranald, hailing him with effusion. \" The sight of a friend is doubly welcome on a wild night, in a wild part like this, with such an unchancy job in hand.\" O'Neal did not fail in a hearty response, but he was inclined to hurry over his greetings and check the flow of Lady Clanranald's discursive talk under the most adverse circumstances. The hour and the woman were come, and he dared not let them slip. He had seen too many baffled schemes and frustrated attempts. The danger was too imminent. He must E"], [70, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 50 grasp at the last straw. He led the way to one of the larger and more screened holes, and begged leave to show the company how to stoop for the first few yards of the entrance, and then to stand upright and move freely in the scooped-out interior, where men's hands had aided the work of nature in loosening rocks and sweeping away deposits of sand. The ground underneath had been trodden hard, till it served as a tolerably level floor. There was a fire burning in the centre of the cave, and in order to prevent the smoke from attracting attention, as it might have done even in the lonely and unvisited region, had it found an exit by a hole in what served for the roof, it was suffered, at the risk of partially suffocating any inexperienced occupant of the den, to penetrate and lodge in pungent eddies and whirling wreaths, through all the nooks and passages which ran out of the centre of the excavation. The man who was chiefly exposed to the over powering reek had served a severe apprenticeship to such fumes since his first night on the Long Island, when his coughing and sneezing and rushing into the open air to secure a breath which should not choke him, had roused the suspicion of his rustic host. The vapour was so thick and dark, while the artificial red glow from the fire was so impeded, that even Flora, well used to peat reek \u2014 not only in its more refined and subdued form, but also in its original strength in shepherds' and boatmen's huts, could not for a moment, keen as her vision was, and eager as she was to use it, see a couple of inches before her. When her sight cleared she could distinguish that the place was unfurnished except for a rough shelf running along one side of the interior, on which such supplies of food and such dishes as Lady Clanranald"], [71, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 51 dared send, were stored, while in one corner lay a pile of plaids that might suffice for a bed. Flora was fain to devour with her eyes the person she desired to see and had come to save, the source of all the plotting and fighting, heading and hanging and store distress of the last troubled twelve months. This was the man for whose cause so many of his countrymen, with an open-eyed conviction of the destruction which lay before them, had accepted ruin and death, the man for whose self nine-tenths of the women of Scotland had lost not only their hearts, but their wits, and she was not sure that she was not another woman added to the number. The first feeling which Flora was conscious of as Lady Clanranald led her up to the Prince was one of half-incredulous disappointment. Could this be the \"Prince Charlie\" so many were raving about, and Lorraine Macdonald was doting upon ? Only a long-legged, slight-made lad in a suit little better than O'Neal's, with his face sharpened by want, and his fair skin blackened by exposure ! Dishevelled locks of yellow hair were visible under the half displaced black perruque which he usually wore for disguise. His hands and half-bare lean arms were blood-stained as he squatted before the fire, engi-ossed by the interesting, but hardly regal, employment of roasting in the ashes the heart, liver, and kidneys of a disembowelled sheep. These were impaled for the purpose on a strip of wood in the absence of oven, jack, and skewer. Flora was not what she would have called \" a fine lady,\" neither was she unacquainted with the straits to which hunters may be reduced when they stalk the deer, or lie all night in the snow waiting for the chance of a shot at a wild swan or a wild cat, but"], [72, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 52 she had seldom encountered anything so squalid, so lost to all the decorums of life, in any man, young or old, purporting to be in the rank of a gentleman. Moreover Flora had been used to mighty men, to her grandfather \" the strong minister,\" to her step father, Captain Hugh of Armadale, who, when there had been time for such trifles, was the unquestioned champion in every athletic sport in which his brother islanders engaged, to young Kingsbarrow, a captain in a line regiment, not merely in the country militia. Why, even her brother Milton, short and bull-necked in his thick-setness, and counted heavy and clumsy by his critics, was a man in his thews and sinews. This was little better than a tall stripling. He heard their approaching steps, and looked round with the quick furtive glance of man or beast hunted for many weeks. The next instant he in stinctively pulled down his sleeves, and re-adjusted his unpowdered hair for the benefit of the company come upon the scene. He said to O'Neal, speaking with a slight foreign accent, in a half-jesting tone \u2014 \" Ah, my friend, you have stolen a march upon me. How could you bring ladies here without a word of warning, when you knew we were in undress, engaged on oui' private affairs ? For shame, sir ; we must call you to account for this by-and-bye.\" The Prince turned to Lady Clanranald and Flora with his air of a court, his manner as of one born to command \u2014 the descendant not of a single usurping king, but of a long race of kings, from each of whom he had acquired some trick of feature, some gesture, some accent of the voice which belonged by rights to the bearer of a sceptre, and the wearer of a crown. Moreover the sovereignty was delicately tempered"], [73, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 53 with graciousness, and relieved and set off by the unquenchable light-heartedness, the brave, buoyant spirit of youth. Everything set well on him amidst the plain tokens of his utter destitution. He was so royal, though he wore no star on his breast, no embroidered garter round his knee, in the nobility \u2014 such as it was \u2014 which underlay and overpowered his adversity, and was in broad contrast to it, he was so unmistakably what he claimed to be, so unconsciously affable, so pathetically gay, that Flora's heart, like many another's, melted in her breast. She freely forgave him all the evil which she had been told, which she was forced to believe, his rashness and self-will, the intolerable short-comings of him and his race, had brought upon the most loyal, no less than the most malcontent of the nation. Flora did not refuse the salute which the Prince offered to her and to Lady Clanranald, she even thrilled under her share of it. She would have followed Lady Clanranald's example in seeking to kiss his hand, had he not drawn it away laughingly, looked at it in a kind of amused wonder and disgust, and forthwith despatched O'Neal to fetch from the spring outside a pitcher of water, into which the Prince plunged his hands and arms, wiping them with a towel from Lady Clanranald's supply. He might have mistaken the hand-kissing for a mark of allegiance, but in Flora's case it was because her heart was big with commiseration. She remembered how the dauntless minister, who had preached in one of the Edinburgh kirks during the Prince's residence in his Scotch capital, had prayed \u2014 no doubt protected by the castle guns\u2014 that the young Prince who had come among them seeking an earthly crown might not miss a heavenly one, and she asked herself"], [74, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 54 whether his early promotion to the amaranth crown might not be his best chance of salvation ? Yet Flora would strive her best, and do what mortal woman could to keep it back from him \u2014 yes, and Lorraine had not seen him \" straiket,\" with or without his head, in the black coach. Flora ceased to feel any surprise because young Lorraine and middle-aged Lady Clanranald, and all the women high and low, were \"gane wud \" for those bright blue eyes \u2014 of another blue than Flora's, of another blue than Lorraine's, bluer than any bluart, those unkempt yellow locks, which, if they were cared for, as they ought to be, should glitter like gold in the sunshine, that frank masterful smile, that eager winning tongue. \"No, no,\" the Prince was defying O'Neal's entreaty that he should make haste and be gone. \" The disguise and the boat must wait a little, we must have a royal banquet before we ride \u2014 or row, it comes very much to the same thing. The ladies must grace a meal of my cooking. His majesty of France, is no mean cook, they say, but then our royal cousin is amply provided with materials and utensils \u2014 the more credit to those who can do without them. I am not forgetting your choice suppers, madam\" \u2014 with the most gracious of bows to Lady Clanranald \u2014 \" and we must still be obliged to you for the plates and knives and forks, but we'll leave untouched your roast fowls and your hunters' pies on this occasion \u2014 rather we'll carry them over to Skye with us, and do justice to them the first thing on landing. At present we'll confine ourselves to my dishes, which I've burned my fingers and singed my wig in preparing.\" \"I hope your Royal Highness has confined your"], [75, "'THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 55 burning and singeing to your fingers and your wig,\" said O'Neal, unable to resist entering into the farce. \"May it please your Koyal Highness,\" interposed MacEachan, with another sympathetic grin, \"your act is not without precedent. One of your ancestors on the English side did a bit of cooking, if history is to be believed. But I am sorry to say he did not confine himself to birstling his fingers.\" \" The more fool he, if he was to eat of the cakes he toasted,\" retorted the Prince. \" Eh, but it is droll ! \" cried Lady Clanranald, with round eyes of mingled amazement and diversion, \"to be banquetting with a Prince \u2014 no less, and the bill of fare to be a sheep's ' inmates,' while there is nothing save a flat stone for a table, and bunches of heather for seats.\" In the meantime MacEachan was dishing with alacrity and dexterity the roasted heart, liver, and kidneys of the sheep, and making the arrangements for the impromptu meal. \"It is good for a change,\" asserted the Prince, audaciously. \" How could it be otherwise than good with two such supporters ? \" he asked gallantly, as he put Lady Clanranald on his right and Flora on his left, and invited O'Neal and MacEachan to take their places opposite. \" If your Eoyal Highness will allow us, we'll rather wait on you and the ladies,\" said O'Neal, \"and take our bite standing.\" \"And if you will forgive me for declining the greatest honour that ever was, or ever is like to be put upon me,\" chimed in MacEachan, with his tact and fluency, \"it will not only be more fitting, we'll also be in greater readiness to clear away.\" \"You're two cross-grained rascals,\" said the Prince,"], [76, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 56 lightly, \" and I'll take it out of you when we reach St. James's. Ah ! won't this banquet be a fine story for the stiff and starched old courtiers, and the wits of the coffee-houses and taverns ? We must have a bumper of the native wine \u2014 what is it that you call it ? Ferntosh, usquebah, to drink to his Majesty, and a happy meeting at St. James's. A fig for our being turned back once in a way. I invite 'you, madam \u2014 and you'll be sure to bring Clanranald, though he was lagging when I summoned him last spring \u2014 and you, Mistress Flora, to honour us with your presence.\" He bowed low to each lady. He ate heartily the homely food of his cooking. He continued his cheery chat with abundant references to St. James's, as if it were but on the other side of the Minch, and he were bound to have a speedy and successful crossing, till, enjoyable as his condescension was, Lady Clanranald's patience began to give way. \"Indeed, sir, it is you and me both that must be stepping, if your Royal Highness will excuse me for re minding you of the obligation. I am grieved to break up the party which you have been pleased to make so fine, that, St. James's or no, I for one will never forget it. But the best of friends must part. It is between eight and nine o'clock, and if you're to profit by the darkness, you must take boat without delay. It is a long row to Skye, and the day will have more than half dawned before you're at the shore. God send you a safe landing, sir, and a good passage to France ; and \u2014 and it is little I've been able to do for you, but the will has not been wanting, if you ever come to your own you'll mind my son, my laddie who has thrown up everything to follow you, and is a wanderer likewise on the face of the earth this"], [77, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 57 day, not that I blame him, or presume to blame you who are in no better plight? If I had been in his shoon and you had sent for me yon April morning, I would have joined your standard, though my father had laid his commands on me to keep me back and ca' canny. Maybe your father did the same by you, but young blood will not be cooled. There, I've said my say.\" The kindly garrulous matron wound up her speech and rose to her feet. \" I must be going this instant, or Clanranald will think some mischanter has happened, or that I'm lost entirely. Captain \" \u2014 appealing to O'Neal\u2014 \" you'll just give me a convoy to the top of the brae, while the Prince is in the far end, out of sight, changing his duds with the help of Niel. Flora, you'll stay where you are, you'll get wet enough, poor lassie, without trailing up the brae with me. Good-bye, my dear, and God bless you! You're very brave \u2014 braver than I could be, but then I'm growing auld, and I've seen troubles. I mind the last rising and what came of it, ochone ! But there's no use speaking of that at this time of the day. You'll hie you back with good news, Flora Milton, and we'll not know what to make of you for what you've done for us all. My last duty to your Boyal Highness and my respects to Lady Marget, and your worthy mother, Fhionghail.\" But Lady Clanranald was not permitted to depart in this fashion, not even after the Prince had taken the most courteous leave of her, and promised fervently, to befriend her son when it was in his power, \u2014 not when Flora had wrapped her old friend's plaid round her and tied on her hood, and O'Neal had started up in a fever to perform the small service required of him, in order to return the faster and expedite the departure of the Prince."], [78, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 58 Ears well on the alert caught a hasty footfall without, a concerted signal was interchanged, and then Clanranald's special henchman appeared in a great flurry. \"You must come back with me, my lady, Clan ranald his own self has sent me to hurry you. The red coats are at Ormiclade. Knock and his militia have arrived, and the master does not know how to hold them again, without you to back him. Forby your absence will be remarked upon and inquired into. Clanranald bids me say, Mistress Flora and her Irish maid must not be stopping another five minutes. They must take to the water, bad as the night is, and the sooner they put a bit of the Minch and the bigger the bit they put, between them and Benbecula and Allan of the Knock, the better for us.\" All was bustle and confusion when Clanranald's message had been delivered. O'Neal and Mac- Eachan hurried the Prince, without ceremony, round a projection of the rock into the furthest recess of the cave which was to serve as his dressing-room. \" Oh ! the sorry, Allan of the Knock,\" cried poor Lady Clanranald. \"He's the hardest and the sharpest of the militia captains. I would as soon face one of the cutters' captains, nabbing his English ; I believe Allan would take the blood-money not heeding the black shame, and would go off and settle in the wilds of Ireland, like Norman Berneray before him. It is not me who will be sending my compli ments and a cask of Edinburgh ale, and a jar of coffee beans, to Knock next year. \" Had you not better make a detour and call some where on your way back, Lady Clanranald ? \" sug gested quick-witted Flora. \" It will keep you longer,"], [79, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 59 but it will enable you to give a reason for being abroad in the mirk and wet.\" \" That will I,\" agreed Lady Clanranald, struck with the wisdom of the advice. \"You've an old head on young shoulders, bairn. I'll turn down the loaning and look in at poor Jess Maclure's. She's far gone in a decline, and will not last many days longer. One would not need to mind pit-mirk or wind and wet who would see her in life. No, I'll not be wanting Captain O'Neal now, he's more wanted here, and Clanranald's hector will give me all the convoy I want.\" CHAPTER V. 44 Far ha'e I ridden, and muckle ha'e I seen, But o' lang-bearded milk-maidens saw I never ane.\" Old Song. Lady Clanranald was gone, and Flora was left yet a brief interval by herself. Then, ushered in by O'Neal and MacEachan, so strange and fantastic a figure that it might have flitted fitly through Lorraine Macdonald's visions, came into the circle of light round the fire, louted low in the performance of the most awkward of curtseys before Flora, and said in a voice tremulous with laughter \u2014 \" Betty Burke, your humble servant, madam.\" The figure was that of a tall \u2014 as it seemed gigan tically tall \u2014 woman in a blue and white sprigged linen gown, a canvas \" brat \" or apron, and a mutch with the broad border hanging well over the face, which was farther hidden by the hood of such a gray \"duffle\" cloak as servants, or women of the lower"], [80, "60 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" class up from the Lowlands, or over from the neigh bouring country of Ireland, commonly adopted in the room of the plaid universal in the Highlands and Islands. Flora was quite prepared for the apparition. Indeed, she had taken an active part in the getting up of what was really a clever impromptu example of the character to be represented, yet she thought with dismay there never was a more masculine-looking handmaid than the so-called woman before her. Flora's riding-habit was considered a becoming com promise necessary under the circumstances, between the dress of men and women. But the poor Prince's disguise was the reverse of becoming ; and the well developed nose and chin and marked face which be longed to a handsome young man, were strong enough to constitute a hard-featured woman. Flora in her habit, was femininity and modesty itself, con trasted with the bold \" gamaleerie \" aspect of her maid. Happily, there was no mirror in which she or he could see himself, but he was behaving in other respects, somewhat to Flora's discomfiture, as if he were dressed for ,\" guisarding \" or masquerading, while in her opinion, the errand on which they were going, was no laughing matter. There was still a sharp contention between the contracting parties before the travellers started. To Flora's surprise and displeasure, she found that O'Neal was getting ready to accompany the Prince, Niel MacEachan and herself. \" It cannot be, gentlemen,\" she said firmly. \" My stepfather's passport which he has given at his proper peril, only passes three \u2014 me, Niel MacEachan, as my man-servant, and an Irish spinning-maid, whom my father will be sending to my mother at"], [81, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 61 Ormaclade. I cannot carry three gentlemen disguised or undisguised, in my party. I beg to call your attention to the fact that the more there are of us, the greater attention we will attract, and the less likely the authorities will be to let us go on \u2014 should we have the misfortune to encounter them, and it is probable we shall. I am sorry to take it upon me to find fault with your arrangements, but would you risk the whole affair ? \" \" True for you, Miss Macdonald,\" said O'Neal, in some agitation, \" but think how much you're asking ? I was with his Royal Highness when he first landed in Scotland, I've been with him through all the ups and downs of this unhappy expedition. There are those to whom I've to answer for his safety. Am I to give him up, at the eleventh hour, to entrust him to the guidance of a young woman \u2014 a young lady for whom I've the highest respect, but who cannot contest the point that she is only a woman after all ? Is that to see the last of my Prince \u2014 to offer my life for his, if the offering should be called for ? \" \"You should have thought of all this before, sir, and told me what was in your mind,\" said Flora, her eyes sparkling with anger, and with the strain of hardness in her voice that was possible to it. \" If you think that by entrusting the Prince to me, you may jeopardize any reward than can ever come to you, set your mind at rest for I will never dispute it with you.\" She regretted the words the moment they were spoken, for she was a generous woman, and her opponent was at her mercy, so that though he had exasperated her by his unreasonableness, it was mean and unworthy of her to taunt him with the fear of endangering a payment which was little likely to be made."], [82, "\"THE jMACDONALD LASS.\" 62 \"Madam,\" said the Prince, brought to such a 6ense of the seriousness of the situation, that he even lost sight of the incongruity between dignified plead ing on his part, and the grotesquely absurd habili ments in which he was clad. \" Would you not spare me one familiar face ere I be gone from this in hospitable country ? What does it matter to me that it is my father's kingdom ? It is casting me out, as it cast out him and his father before him. Where I should have numbered entertainers by the thousand, I am denied the one friend I know and can trust, to stand by me and make my misery endurable, till I can quit Scotland, or, as is more to be expected, till I am shot like a dog on the hillside, or dragged off to lay down my head on the block.\" The tears sprang to Flora's eyes. \" Sir, do you not see,\" she said, \"that the ordering of this business is not in my hands any more than it is in yours ? For it would be still less to your honour than it would be to mine, to fail to comply with the sole con ditions which make the endeavour practicable. Would you and Captain O'Neal risk the loss of more lives, and the ruin of more households than need be, for a piece of sentiment ? Have neither of you learnt the lesson that you've thrown enough away on what was not just yours to waste, on what many a good man who would have been with you, if he had not thought on his neighbours as well as on himself, has called the forlorn hope of a desperate ambition ? If you are willing to squander, without rhyme or reason, still more men's necks and fortunes, women's hearts and bairns' bread, I will not be a consenting party to it. I know what it has cost my stepfather, Captain Hugh Macdonald, to pretend not to see your Royal Highness when you were shooting and fishing under"], [83, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 63 his very nose in Glen Corrodale, and you thought it was all your own daring and cleverness that enabled you to get off scot free. I know what it has cost him to grant that deceiving passport. I think of my ailing mother and her second family of young children, depending upon the head of the house as the bread winner at Armadale. I mind on my kind old friends the Clanranalds, who are sore put to it, and will be utterly compromised if there is any misadventure in this voyage. I told you plainly, Captain O'Neal, that it was for their sakes as well as out of com passion for your master, and for the honour of the Country, ay, and for that of the reigning government, that I suffered myself to be over-persuaded to take it upon me to conduct the Prince to Skye. But it may not be, I will not be putting my foot in the boat, no, nor will I be surrendering the passport, if you and he, for whom so much is dared, will not do what is only common sense and bare discretion.\" \" Miss Macdonald is right,\" said MacEachan, who had remained judiciously in the background, and kept out of the discussion, but who now ventured to come forward and throw his casting vote into the dispute. \"The whole plan will be swamped, if tbe pass is overweighted; it stands to reason. That is my opinion if I am permitted to give it.\" \"There is no occasion, MacEachan.\" The Prince spoke a little haughtily and testily. \" The lady's wishes must be mine and my friend O'Neal's.\" The two young men who had been in that closest companionship which belongs to sharing the extremity of hardship and danger, went aside for a moment to bid each other farewell. The Irishman was moved to tears instead of laughter, as he kissed the hand of the ostensible \"Betty Burke.\""], [84, "64 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" Betty put her other hand to her face, as if seeking to control, as well as to hide, the emotion which was apt to bring on the bleeding at the nose \u2014 the last straw added to his misfortunes. The Prince gave his follower such necessary instruc tions as it might be in O'Neal's power to obey. He searched about his person at the last moment, as if to distract his mind by trying to find whether he had anything worthy of bestowal left upon him. There was no need to apply to \" Betty Burke's \" purse, which in order to keep up her character was only moderately furnished, for O'Neal had in his charge certain concealed consignments of money \u2014 said to be buried in different places, for the use of the Prince and his suite. He bethought himself of something at last. His brogues though rude enough were less uncouth than O'Neal's. Instead of the leather thongs, they were garnished, if it could be called so, with the coarsest iron buckles. Before his action could be anticipated, he stooped down and wrenched off one of the buckles, giving it with all the grace of the royal giver of a royal gift to O'Neal, \" Another token for St. James's ; see that you do not lose it, O'Neal, if you do not wish to miss the chance of having the iron converted into diamonds.\" The little party separated. In the course of the next two hours O'Neal was arrested by some of Allan of Knock's men prowling on the Prince's track. Clanranald's brother Macdonald of Boisdale was also taken prisoner, though Clanranald himself was suffered to remain in his own house. But there was sore anxiety at Ormiclade. The Prince soon recovered his good temper and good spirits. The last need not be attributed to incur able levity. They might have had more to do with the"], [85, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 65 recklessness induced by the life he had been leading for the last few months, which, acting on a mercurial disposition, caused him, at this date, to snatch at any respite from his troubles, or any indemnification for the sordidness of his surroundings. Such an in demnification was afforded by the call for active exertion, and whatever took the form of an adventure. He had the fondness for romantic escapades and encounters which had distinguished his remote ancestor the Laird of Balingeich. 44 Up yon heathery mountain And down yon scraggy glen We canna go a-milking For Charlie and his men,\" sang one of the persecuted damsels of the Prince contending for a crown. The grotesque air, which the adventurer took from the nature of his disguise, only lent an additional zest to the occasion. He trailed along the encum brances of his long cloak and the skirts of his gown, through the mud and wet, very philosophically, as he traversed between Flora and MacEachan, the rough road to the shore. He was by no means oblivious to the fact that one of his companions was a young and handsome woman. She was not the style of woman he preferred ; she had set herself against him and dealt him a rebuff at their first meeting, and princes, as a rule, do not relish opposi tion and rebuffs. He was a little reminded of another Charles, his grand-uncle, King Charles II. , who had been a wanderer and an outcast in his time. He had been preached at by whole Scotch Presbyteries of schismatics\u2014 according to his ideas, in Geneva gowns and bands, with long sour faces above the bands. It is not in the natural course of things for princes F"], [86, "66 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" by Divine right to welcome such treatment from their subjects. But this was not a whole Presbytery, it was a single puritanical pragmatical girl. Happily she was not sour-faced, though she was demure and a trifle dogged. He remembered a lovely white witch from these islands, whom he had seen at Holyrood and could have wound round his finger. It would have been very different and a great deal better if she had been his guide, but when one could not have the best, the next thing was to put up with the second best. It would be one indemnification to him to subdue this prickly rose, and a shame to him if he could not accomplish it. And a man of approved gallantry was cosmopolitan in every sense. He could not fail to admire what he saw dimly, through the rain and the dusk, of Flora's free light step, her upright elastic gait, the faint shadow \u2014 as it were of her steadfast face, in its warm brown and red colour ing, under her hat. He held out his hand and proposed to help her when the roughness of the path increased, but she told him respectfully that she knew every step of the way which he did not know at all, and she was sure he must have enough to do to keep his feet, and scramble along in a gown instead of a kilt or trews, stumbling and tearing the gown till it would soon be unwearable. He raised his eyebrows at her refusal of his good offices, if she could have seen him through the ob scurity which encompassed them, while Niel Mac- Eachan grinned to himself under the shelter of the same semi-darkness. It must be confessed the circumstances were not favourable for polite compliments and graceful philandering; but the Prince was an ardent deter mined youth in whatever he took in hand, and though"], [87, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 67 he was not sufficiently heroic to rise above every adverse obstacle, he was equal to the present disad vantages if Flora had been capable of waiving them. He drew nearer to her and said softly, in his slightly broken English, that he wished the stormy night were as balmy as it ought to have been in the height of summer, as he had known it in sunnier lands. He wished there had been no obligation on them to press on, for then they could have tarried in the silence and solitude, and she might have consented to teach him to know the different kinds of heather, and to distinguish the various notes of the moorland birds. \"If there had been so much of leisure and immunity from more serious considerations for your Royal Highness,\" Flora answered calmly, \"you would have had your work to do, and been called upon to keep fitter company.\" Again the Prince's arched eyebrows went up unseen by anybody. \" Are all Highland maids as strict in their notions of what is fitting ? Are they all as coy and cruel ? \" he insinuated in languishing reproach. \" I trow not,\" said Flora bluntly, and quite loud enough for MacEachan to hear. \" There are as great fules among maids and men in the Highlands as elsewhere. But one would not have to do with gowks \u2014 Uttle better than ' naturals ' \u2014 if a body could help it. There are times and places, moreover, when folly is least excusable. Let us be thankful that you and I, sir, are not to be ranked with the fule-kind, whatever.\" She said it with all the more devoutness that she had been thinking of her cousin Lorraine, and realizing, with a thrill of horror, that there might have been"], [88, "68 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" devil's work if Lorraine had been, where she would have given all she possessed to be, in Flora's place. But doubtless, she told herself again, the Prince meant nothing by what he said, and the manner in which he said it, he was merely indulging in the idle com plimentary gallantry which she had been accustomed to regard as a French fashion \u2014 too easily allowed to men of his grade in society. He went on another tack. He spoke of how much he owed to the Clan Macdonald, how many friends he had among them \u2014 not the least of whom was the young lady walking by his side. It had been a true instinct which had sent him for a refuge, till he could take ship to France, to these islands, where the men were all faithful and the women were all kind. He might well forgive Sir Alexander and Macleod of Dun vegan for holding back from his standard, when it was unfurled in Glenfinnan \u2014 he could not resist the grudging allusion. \"We are but poor folk, here, your Royal Highness\" \u2014 Flora took up the cudgels, nothing loth, for her friends \u2014 \"we were some of us out in the last rising, and thirty years have not sufficed for us to hold up our heads again. Another defeat (and few saw any prospect of victory) , with all the harrying and forfeiting to follow, would have been so bad for us that you might as well have sunk the Hebrides at once beneath the sea. You and yours may be content with what the Mac donalds of the mainland did for you, if indeed you are not tempted to rue the day you summoned them to join you.\" Her voice shook, for she remembered Keppoch filling his bloody grave on the field of Culloden, and recognized how his heart must have broken, when his clan fell back from him, and in his despair he charged the enemy single-handed."], [89, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 69 Involuntarily she recalled the blood-stains on the Prince's hands when she had first seen him that evening. She glanced askance at him in the gloom, as if she still expected to see the ominous stains on the long fingers with which he was gingerly clutching his gown, and she could not resist a shudder of repulsion. So young, so gallant, so gay and so fatal to his followers. He had probably borne as much remonstrance as it was possible for him to endure, for he now gave her a nettled thrust back. \"If only my good friends the Macdonalds,\" he said with peculiar suavity, \"had thought a little less of their rival claims and a little more of my poor fortunes, the result might have been other than it was, and victory, even in the end, need not have been so impossible. You may not be aware that at Culloden they kept the whole field at a standstill and threw the ranks into disarray, till the important question was settled which branch of the clan was to have the honour of leading the right wing, and which was to submit to lead the left, in what was destined to be a rout.\" She accepted the charge with sorrowful candour. \"Yes,\" she said, \"we're all alike; we're all seeking each our own without a thought to the things of our neighbour.\" If compliments and gallantry were out of place in the situation it may well be thought moralizing and philosophizing were still more so. Yet if it had been in the Prince's power to cultivate a more prolonged and intimate acquaintance with the high-spirited, shrewd, witty young belles of his Scotch capital, especially with those who had been brought up on the Whig side of the question, he would have found \" the"], [90, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 70 young sprigs of grace,\" quite as ready to bandy arguments, and hold their own in animated dispute with him, as to fall down and worship him, and to count what would have been an unwarrantable liberty and an absolute insult from another, an honour when it came from his Royal Highness's lips and hands. The Whig women might have risked their lives and liberties to save him, all the same, for they were women, after all ; and women of all shades of political opinions had gone even more \" wud,\" for the Prince beaten and a fugitive, with a price set on his head, than for the Prince in his brief day of success and triumph. But they would have held him at arm's length and argued with him whether the arguments were political, philosophical, or theological, to their last breath. \" Whisht ! whisht ! Taisez-vous, your Royal High ness,\" whispered MacEachan excitedly, as the three stood on the strand ; \" our boat is not the only boat hereabout.\" CHAPTER VI. Row weel, my boatie, row weel ; Row weel, my merry men a' ! \" Old Song. The holders of the argument dropped the threads of it as if it burnt them, and forgot everything except the scene they were in and the expedition on which they were bound. The little party were now so close to the sea that they could hear not only the sound of the breakers, they could catch the splash of oars which might have been mistaken for those in Clanranald's boat, had"], [91, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 71 Niel not indicated cautiously that it had been drawn up at the next point. \" We must bide still a moment,\" he counselled his companions under his breath, \" and our boat must lie close for another quarter of an hour, and give the first sea-room.\" As he spoke there was a momentary break in the heavy canopy of cloud, and a lightening of the summer night's darkness until the group could see, as well as hear, the boat. It was riding on the crests of the waves which were turning up a wan white lining, as the belly of a beast of prey will show up pale against its dark fur. \" It is a cutter's boat, rowed by cutter's men \u2014 I ken the stroke of them, and if there was a mune it might glint on their whingers. But they do not see us, or our boat round the shelve of the shore, and we're well quit of them, whatever,\" remarked Niel, com posedly, beginning to move towards the boat which had remained perdu. It was one of the hundreds of hair-breadth escapes which the Prince underwent in his wanderings, so that friends and foes alike might have been excused for believing that he bore a charmed life \u2014 preserved for great issues. Six of the trustiest of Clanranald's men, who had received a hint of the dignity of one of their passengers, lay low, the better to avoid observation, in the stoutest boat belonging to Benbecula. They started up at the first glimpse of Flora and her companions, and made room for them, only awaiting a signal from Niel to push off. It was no summer night's pleasure excursion, such a night of gathering storm had rarely torn and tossed the Minch into a fury. For no ordinary fishing would even these hardy islanders have braved the"], [92, "72 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" violence of the tempest. Wild men, as they were counted in the Lowlands, bare-headed, bare-footed, bare-breasted, with their skin tanned like leather, ready to spring like so many wolves on slender provo cation at the throats of their enemies, there was, as happens in the case of most half-civilized races, a strain of childishness running athwart their ferocity. \" Ochone ! ochone ! it is rough, rough,\" they groaned again and again, as they bent to the oars, pulled against the tide, and thought of the wives and children in the huts on the shore. To Flora, these and similar waters were the ordinary high roads traversed, not occasionally, but constantly, as a rule, unless she was to confine her visiting to her next-door neighbours. She had been on them in all weathers and at all hours, but as the gale burst with a hoarse roar over the boat and its crew, she owned to herself that she had never before known such a howling, raging turmoil of the heavens above and the deep beneath, as if the Prince of the powers of the air was let loose to do his worst against all poor earthly princelings who were utterly at his mercy. It was for the Prince's benefit in one respect that the night should be dark, wet, and wild, so as to draw a veil over the scene. It tended to keep the enemy from maintaining a sharp watch and from starting at any moment in pursuit of the fugitive. But what if the choice lay between his being taken prisoner and conveyed to the butcher Cumberland at Inverness, or hurried under a guard of soldiers to London to the Tower, tried in Westminster Hall and condemned \u2014 not the first of the Stuarts \u2014 to mount a scaffold, and between his perishing under cloud of night, in kindred obscurity, a passenger in a"], [93, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 73 fisherman's boat, swamped in a remote northern sea, the very name of which would sound strange and uncouth in the ears of the great world, while his fate would long remain a mystery? Which destiny was the worthier of the son of a race of kings ? And was she \u2014 Flora Macdonald \u2014 a poor young gentlewoman, of no great estate, utterly unknown in the high circles to which he belonged, was she who had seen him for the first time that night, who had been brought up to regard even lawful claims \u2014 put forth as his had been, with more antagonism than sympathy, to die with him and for him ? Was this to be her fate ? Would the kindly Clanranalds be sorry that they had thrust her into the breach, and thus driven her on her doom? Would her brother Angus forgive her folly because of the heavy price she had paid for it ? Would her cousin Lorraine see her at that moment swathed in her winding-sheet ? Would Flora's mother and stepfather and the little brothers and sisters at Armadale, with the old servants and pensioners she had known all her life, grieve for her and miss her ? Would her little terrier dog look out for his mistress in vain ? What would Allan Kingsbarrow think the next time he came home, heard the news, and knew that her place was for ever vacant ? Flora was a brave woman, she told herself she could die but once, and if it was so ordained, what death could be better than that of dying in the attempt to save a fellow-creature \u2014 be he prince or peasant? What did it matter though he had been bred in a different school, and was not of her way of thinking ? Thunder and lightning were added to Nature's weapons of war. The crash of the thunder rendered"], [94, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 74 the belated boat's crew deaf to the shriek and wail of the wind, and the monotonous dash and beat of the waves. The lightning flashed ghastly glimpses of the strained faces of the men, from which the sweat dropped. They were moved to tears as they laboured at their task, and moaned, \" Ochone, ochone ! it is rough, rough.\" Then the blue light played on the keen, vigilant face of Niel MacEachan at the helm, on the haggard young face of the mock woman towering in the midst of the group, on Flora's own troubled face which she could not see. Flora was fain to crouch down on the ballast, as if for shelter from the sheets of rain and the salt water shipped at intervals. She said the prayers she had learnt to say at her mother's knee, and murmured the Gaelic version of the psalm \u2014 44 1 to the hills will lift mine eyes, From whence doth come mine aid My safety cometh from the Lord, Who heaven and earth hath made. The psalm had been a favourite with \"the strong minister,\" and when Flora was a Uttle girl he had given her a whole silver sixpence for repeating it to him without missing a word. As drowning people recall every incident of their lives in the space of a second, so Flora recalled the gUtter of that six pence, and remembered how she had been taken to the cattle-fair at Portree to spend it. She had bought a blooming, buxom Dutch doll with her wealth, and its fixed stare was still before her mental eyes. The Prince was constitutionally indifferent to danger \u2014 to the extent of being enamoured of it. Perhaps the danger he liked least, which was most"], [95, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 75 antipathetic to his French and Polish rearing, was a rocking boat on a stormy sea in wind, rain, and darkness ; but on the present occasion they did not daunt him, they rather exhilarated him. He was cheerful and disposed to talk. He told appropriate stories of his foreign adventures to any one free to listen to him. Under the impression that he was raising the spirits of the doleful boatmen, he hummed fragments of songs \u2014 French chansons of which only Flora and Niel could comprehend a stray word. He had recourse to an old English ditty, which might have been in keeping had he been suffered to march on London, as he had wished, a year ago \u2014 44 Oh ! it was a glorious day When the king enjoyed his own again.\" Presently he was singing the French soldiers' song which the Chevalier de St. George might have heard when he fought in the wars of the Low Countries \u2014 \" MarWrooh se va t'en guerre.\" Then Flora, as she lay, felt a hand, gentle as a woman's, softly arranging her plaid so as to shelter her head and shoulders, and heard a carefully modulated voice cautioning the boatmen to avoid coming in contact with the baUast, lest they should disturb her. He believed she was asleep, and had elected to watch over her and protect her. Poor Prince ! he was not ungrateful then, and he bore no malice, though she had presumed to find fault with him, and had been hard upon him. And he was so boyish stiU in the middle of his royalty and his misfortunes. He was what her brother Ranald might have been at the same age \u2014 that Ranald who was only a pensive, tender dream to his sister, who, if he had been alive, would have"], [96, "76 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" been older than Angus, upwards of forty years of age. If Flora had possessed a younger brother, a fine young man, and not a mere child like the boy Duncan in the second family over at Armadale, would she not have gone through fire and water for him ? Flora's true woman's heart warmed and melted to the Prince in one big throb. When there was a luU in the storm, so that the weary boatmen could rest for a moment on their oars, they had to confess with fresh lamentations, to themselves and to all concerned, that they were out of their reckoning, and ignorant of their whereabouts. The voyage from Benbecula to the nearest landing place in Skye was usually one of six hours' duration. The boat with Flora and the Prince had been already four hours at sea, but, for all the natives could tell, they might have been unwittingly hugging the coasts of some of the various smaller islands which con stitute the Long Island, and be as far as ever from Skye. The danger would be increased a hundred fold when the approaching dawn revealed to the Argus eyes in the crowd of shipping in the Minch, of which the crew had managed hitherto to steer clear, the Benbecula boat which had been toiling in rowing all night, keeping away from the other craft, and having its head directed to Skye. But the storm was abating, and when the light broke it was discovered, to the exultation of all, that the landmarks in front of them were plainly those of Skye. The ecstasy of the wild boatmen was on a par with their previous despondency. \"Hey! yonder is Port Nish.\" \" Ay, and there will be the nose of Struan.\" \" I can see the Cuchullins through the mist.\" \"Houch! it is us who will be just there,\" shouted the men on all sides. The boat was close"], [97, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 77 upon the shore, and by a happy chance at the very spot where it was most desirable to land. Flora stood up in her thankfulness, and the Prince staggered to her side jubilant, as if it was French land on which he was gazing. \" We've surmounted our difficulties, Miss Mac donald, we've won the day, or rather the night,\" he said gleefully. \" Down with you ! down with you, sir, this minute,\" screamed Niel MacEachan, gesticulating franticaUy in the direction of the island. The light was growing clearer, and there, on the beach before them, was displayed, to startled and dismayed eyes, a miUtia regiment improving its time by a driU. Whoever was dismayed it was not the Prince. Here was a danger to his mind, which he could measure, with which he could cope. He showed an inclination to indulge in a fit of laughter as his cloak and gown fluttered in the wind, and his hood fell back on his neck, exposing the strong-featured, tanned face under the mutch. Instead of complying with MacEachan's warning, he stood, his legs apart, his head thrown back, as if he were critically contem plating the scene \u2014 from which the disconcerted boat men were doing their best to back the boat, till a volley of musketry rattled over them. Even then he did not stir. \" Is your Royal Highness mad ? Prince, do you wish to lay your death at our door ? Scoug from the balls when you can, for God's sake, for all our sakes ! \" MacEachan remonstrated vehemently. \" Nonsense ! \" said Charles Stuart, with derision. \" Man, have you forgotten that I'm a woman ? Those gallant gentlemen will not aim at a woman.\" Then"], [98, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 78 he turned his head, and saw Flora standing arrested near him. \" Take care of yourself, Miss Macdonald,\" he called anxiously to her. \" Stay, if it is a question of one or both of us being exposed to the fire, we'll even let discretion wait on valour, and avail ourselves of the bottom of the boat.\" He pulled her down, and stooped to bear her company. But as they crouched together, wtule he told her of the one Scotch proverb he had learnt, which Cluny had taught him, \" Jouk and let the jaw gae by,\" she was sensible that he protected her with his body from the risk of a second vohey, and her heart swelled anew in answer to his chivalry. The boat was hardly out of gun-shot when he sprang again to his feet, and anticipated MacEachan in bewildering and insulting their recent assailants by cheering them lustily. The boat had to be taken round another miniature cape or \"nose\" in order to shun the chance of encounter with intercepting stragglers from the roused militia. It was midday, after a bad crossing of more than twelve hours instead of six, that the boat accomplished the forty miles between Benbecula and Skye. Lady Clanranald's provisions of smoked hams and tongues and barley bannocks had to be dispensed, with ac companying drams from a stone \" grey -beard,\" before the party landed and prepared to separate at Kilbride, within sight of the mansion house of Monkstadt. There was a hollow under the bank in which Flora's travelling-trunk was deposited and on it the Prince, in the character of \"Betty Burke,\" was left sitting. If one sought for a parallel to his position in song and story, it was more like that of General Monk, of nursery fame, than of any other hero."], [99, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 79 The Benbecula boat started homewards to take to Clanranald the welcome tidings that Miss Macdonald and her maid-servant had reached Skye in safety. Flora and MacEachan set out briskly to walk to the great house, reconnoitre it, and discover what company were staying within its waUs, before they ventured to introduce their charge to its mistress. CHAPTER VII. \" But when the bird saw some red-coats It shook its wings wi' anger.\" Glen. At a casual glance it would seem as if Skye and Monkstadt were about as undesirable places as could be found, in the length and breadth of the Highlands, for the Prince to hide in. The large island of Skye with its grandly romantic scenery \u2014 simply looked upon as savage in these days \u2014 belonged with hardly an exception to the Macdonalds of the Isles, and to different branches of the Clan Macleod, headed by Macleod of Dunvegan. Both clans, with their chiefs, had given occasion for the reproach \u2014 which the Prince had been piqued into addressing to Flora, by abso lutely refusing to join in the rising of '45. They had remained on cannily friendly terms with the reign ing government. Monkstadt was the house of Sir Alexander Macdonald, who was not only the repre sentative of the Lords of the Isles, and the head of Flora's family of Macdonalds, he was the laird under whom his kinsman, Captain Hugh Macdonald, Flora's stepfather, held the tack or lease of Armadale. Sir Alexander was either more pronounced in his"], [100, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 80 Whig views than his neighbours were, or else he felt under a greater obligation to make a public demon stration of his opinions, for he was lending his support to the Duke of Cumberland by Sir Alexander's attendance on the Duke at Inverness. It was these very objections which, by cunning reasoning, induced the Prince's friends, in the terrible urgency of his strait, to fix on Skye and Monkstadt as his next resort. Benbecula, with the Long Island generally, was surrounded and watched on every side ; Skye, as having declared itself all along, in the person of its magnates, in favour of King George, and Monkstadt as the house of a gentleman with Cumber land, were less suspected and less guarded than other islands and mansions. Skye, according to the verdict of all impartial judges was a decided improvement on the smaUer islands. It was hardly regarded as an advantage then, that its landscape was bolder and more akin to the sublime, its mountains culminating in the blue Cuchullins, loftier and more rugged, with more jagged peaks, grimmer chasms, more awful precipices. What was better prized was that the indentations which supplied a fantastic fringe to the shore, were wider, deeper, and fitter for anchorage, and the country was less bleak. The pasture land was more extensive, sup porting larger herds of cattle and flocks of sheep. The birch trees which flourished in most quarters, lent an agreeable variety to the exceeding bareness of the smaller islands. The house of Monkstadt stood on a hillock crowned with birch trees which broke the blasts that whistled round it. It was a high, barrack-like building of grey stone, sparsely supplied with rows of small windows. Its steeply pitched roof was slated, and its"], [101, "'THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 81 pepper-box turrets at once proclaimed its rank, as a Scotch chateau of some antiquity belonging to no mean or plebeian owner. Like most of the great Highland houses of the time, it was open to all comers \u2014 down to the humblest who could show credentials, entitling them to the hospitality of Sir Alexander and his wife, Lady Marget. Work-people or tradespeople from the mainland brought to do some piece of work beyond the skill of the islanders, or coming on their rounds for orders, were entertained as a matter of course in the kitchen or the servants' hall. Travellers of a higher class were not plentiful, but appeared at intervals, when they went, though utter strangers, to the great house as to an inn, since no inn existed within the circuit of many a mile. They went without a bidding and stayed as long as they chose, receiving food, lodging, and courteous attention bestowed on them and their attendants, without the interchange of a single coin of the realm, or the most distant thought of such a thing. To the Macdonald natives of Skye, Monkstadt was the natural rendezvous of gentle and simple, while Sir Alexander, when at home, constituted in his single person a Court of Appeal to which all vexed questions were referred. Naturally there was a constant stream of varied company flowing through the house, the chief circum stance which rendered its primitiveness and remote ness tolerable to its mistress, a Lowland aristocrat and an old Edinburgh belle. Flora knew the place and its owners as intimately as she knew Omiclade and the Clanranalds. She had always stayed at Monkstadt \u2014 a welcome visitor, on her way to and from Milton and Armadale. She had G"], [102, "82 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" been with the Macdonalds to Edinburgh \u2014 to which they repaired annually, in order to see how the great world was wagging, and to mix with their peers. She had been established for a time, by Lady Marget's instrumentality, at the school for \" six or seven gentlewomen,\" kept by Miss Henderson in the Old Stamp Office Close in the High Street. There Flora had learnt to dress, dance, read a little French, converse with spirit and intelligence, and write clear-headed sensible letters. There she acquired her proficiency on the spinet which rendered her reels, strathspeys, pibrochs and laments unapproachable by any other performer. When she accompanied the instrument with her fresh, sweet voice, her milking-songs, spin ning-songs, cradle-songs and old ballads left an echo which survived into the next century. In her school she picked up the art of drawing patterns for the aprons, muslin mantillas, caps and ruffles, which she afterwards embroidered, and presented as valuable birth-day and New Year's gifts to her mother at Armadale, to her cousin Lorraine at Kilmossie, to Lady Marget and Lady Clanranald, and the mistress of Kingsbarrow. When Flora was not one of the six or seven young gentlewomen in the Old Stamp Office Close, she was staying with the Macdonalds in their house in Edinburgh, or she was accompanying Lady Marget to Ayrshire, on a visit to her old home of Eglintoun Castle. This constant intercourse with the family of her chief lasted for three happy years, and was wound up by a delightful summer voyage, in their company, in the smack The Brothers, trading between Leith and Inverness. The voyage undertaken before the outbreak of the rebellion lasted for a fortnight, and among the other passengers were a jocose provost of"], [103, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 83 Inverness and Sir Alexander's great friend Duncan Forbes, laird of Drummossie, one of the most eminent Scotch lawyers and the most perfect Scotch gentleman of his generation. Flora was as much at home at Monkstadt as if she had been a child of the house. She and Niel walked straight into the hall, with its fine antlers, and its disorderly litter, like that of Milton, but on a larger scale, belonging properly to the stables, the kennels, and the gun-room. The new-comers had omitted the ceremony of ringing the great bell, which for that matter was not always available, and found nobody about, save the grey-haired piper who was lounging up and down, and trying an occasional \" spring \" on his silver mounted pipes. Flora hailed him instantly with the questions \u2014 not beginning with was there company in the house ? but with \u2014 what company was there at Monkstadt just now ? Who were with Lady Marget in the drawing-room ? How many more were ex pected to dine and sleep ? Ewan of the Pipes would not have relished the intrusion on his leisure and his musical meditations had the intruder been any other than Miss Flora Macdonald from South Uist, who played pibrochs and laments on her little kist of whistles almost as well as he could on his pipes, and in addition sang the country \" songs \" with nobody to match her, unless it might be his grand-daughter Cathie at the bothy. In fact, Flora was a particular favourite of Ewan's, therefore he bade her a hundred thousand welcomes, tolerated Niel, who was not musical, for her sake, and answered her without delay. There was Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, just arrived from North Uist (she was not very formidable, Flora thought, she was a harmless"], [104, "84 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" woman, and would follow Lady Marget's lead, when she could be taken into the secret, if she did not know it already). As a matter of fact, Mrs. Macdonald Kirkiebost had been sent by other friends of the Prince's on purpose to warn Lady Marget, that his next destination might be Skye. And there was Captain John of Balmeonach, with \"a wheen of his militia officers,\" Ewan ended easily and indifferently, turning again to handle his pipes. Flora darted a quick glance at Niel, who was lingering a second before taking his way to the servants' quarters, and said loudly and distinctly \u2014 \" Then I'll go straight to the drawing-room to let Lady Marget know I'm here ; and, Niel, you'll not go out of the way\u2014 you'll bide in readiness to start at any moment for Armadale.\" \" Not the day, Miss Macdonald, not the day what ever,\" remonstrated Ewan, concerned for the credit of the house. \" You've not broken bread yet, and it's a good bittock to Sleat and Armadale. You'll sleep on it. I've a grand new pibroch I can let you hear.\" \" That is tempting, and it's I who will be very pleased to hear it, if I can tarry the night,\" she answered without any show of haste or preoccupa tion. \"But you know, Ewan, my mother is often complaining (sickly), and I ought to be with her as soon as I can.\" The truth was Mrs. Macdonald, Armadale, was one of those enviably interesting, confirmed invalids, whose delicate health, for which there was no par ticular foundation, save in a weakly constitution and an excitable fancy, afforded to her friends to whom"], [105, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 85 her frequent ailments caused little anxiety, any amount of convenient excuses for doing what they had a mind to do, or for not doing that for which they had no inclination. \" It is so \u2014 the poor lady,\" responded Ewan, shaking his head with the ready lugubriousness of his class and race. Flora did not dare to pause longer to school herself. She entered the Monkstadt drawing-room intrepidly, as if nothing was happening, and stood for a second still wearing her hat and holding up her riding habit, hardly dry from the night's drenching, looking round to see in what group of the guests, sitting and standing about, her hostess was to be found. Lady Marget was not long in discovering herself. \" Flora from Milton ! What good wind has brought you here?\" cried a high sweet voice, destitute of the singing intonation which characterized all the Gaelic speaking voices in the room, while a tall, elegant woman rose from the chair next that of Mrs. Mac donald Kirkiebost \u2014 a homely figure by comparsion \u2014 and embraced Flora with empressement. Lady Marget had been one of the famous \" Eglin toun Beauties,\" of whom mother and daughters, to the number of eight, were wont to alight from their long row of sedan chairs, and dazzle the populace of Edinburgh, waiting round the door of the Old Assembly-rooms at the West Bow, to witness the spectacle. Time and the Highland air had done something to impair the softness of skin and brilliance of complexion supposed to want a wash of sow's milk to keep them in perfection, but the fine features and the stately \"Eglintoun air\" \u2014 the last proverbial in the scene of its triumphs \u2014 were still there in full force."], [106, "86 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" Lady Marget was a well-meaning, kind-hearted woman, somewhat high-handed, and not remarkable for prudence or self-control. It was not to be expected in a lady who had been accustomed to do as she liked, and, for what she chose to do, rewarded with unstinted adulation from childhood upwards, who reigned like a queen over her Highland Court. The political principles of the Montgomeries, Earls of Eglintoun were extreme Tory, and Lady Marget would not have felt the slightest obligation to renounce them, even if she had married a descendant of \" Gillespie Grimach,\" a Campbell and a Whig of the first water. As it was her Highland Chief might be with Cumberland at Inverness, that was his affair not hers, and did not involve any necessity for her to abstain from expressing her sympathy with her prince, in the disasters which had brought his campaign to so unhappy a conclusion. She had gone so far as to write to him under the care of the trusty captain of the little smack, which had brought him to the Long Island. She had given the Prince such information as she could procure of the state of the political parties, and the movements of the soldiers, without in the least counting the cost, or comprehending the degree to which the rash proceeding might compromise herself and Sir Alexander. \"We're just going to sit down to dinner,\" Lady Marget told Flora, with friendly imperiousness ; \"you'll throw off your hat here, and take it as you are.\" \" If you please, Lady Marget, I would rather go up to your room and make my toilet first,\" pleaded Flora, with a beseeching look into which, at the same time, she could not put too much meaning, because of the inquisitive eyes and ears around the pair."], [107, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 87 Lady Marget, full, as usual, of her preconceived ideas, would not take the hint, but would have her way. \" Nonsense ! Flora. Why must you stand on cere mony ? We're all friends here, and the bell would ring before you could go half the road to my room.\" Flora made a general curtsy for the benefit of Mrs. Macdonald Kirkiebost and the militia officers, and sat down desperately, having lost the first chance of communicating to the mistress of the house the distinguished stranger who was near at hand. The girl took stock, covertly, of the men present, who were more or less known to her. All save one looked simple young fellows enough, in their tartan trews and red coats. The lads were, as a rule, impressed by lady Marget's presence and subdued by it into their best behaviour \u2014 a state of mind which, in its self-consciousness and self-restraint, was not favourable to astute observation of their neighbours. The exception was the Captain John Macleod of Balmeonach, whose men were stationed at Uig, two miles off, who had walked over without invitation to avail himself of the Monkstadt hospitality. He was another Allan of Knock. He was not half-hearted, but wholly set on the capture of the Prince. Neither of the men might have consented to touch the thirty thousand pounds' reward for the arrest, since the acceptance would have covered them with infamy and socially ostracized them, if they had not banished themselves for life from their native country. But they were eager for the distinction to be won by securing the prize which had till now eluded all pursuers, for the favour to be gained with the Govern ment by the zeal displayed in carrying out its orders, even if the men were not such red-hot, short-sighted"], [108, "\" THE .MACDONALD LASS.\" 88 Whigs as to suppose that the stability of the Hano verian House depended on taking captive, and bringing to justice, the rival claimant to the throne. Captain John Macleod was a big, sulky-looking, red-headed man with beetle brows, under which he was now staring hard at the handsome pleasant looking young lady who, after she had had the temerity to cross the Minch, over night, in the teeth of a storm, had come quietly into the Monkstadt drawing-room, and seated herself there at Lady Marget's request. Flora saw that he distrusted the purpose for which she had come. He saw that she was not a girl to be shaken in her composure and put down without trouble. \" May I make so bold as to ask where you will be coming from this bad morning, Miss Macdonald ? \" he inquired, speaking across the room in the assured accent of a man who is only doing his duty, and can not be called to account for any liberty he takes in the course of duty. As he spoke he assumed an atti tude of judicial authority with which, as exercised in her drawing-room, Lady Marget was by no means pleased. He threw back his imposing bulk in the spindle-legged chair, folded his arms on his chest, and stretched out his legs a yard in advance of him. \" Why, from Benbecula, to be sure, Captain John,\" answered Flora, with great ingenuousness, smoothing out the crushed ribands of her hat which she had taken off and laid in her lap. \"Did you not know,\" she added, with smiling frankness, \" that I often go on visits to my brother Angus at Milton, in the South Uist, and the crossing is so easy from the South Uist to Benbecula that I'm fond to return that way, in order to carry my mother the last news of her old friends Clanranald and his lady ? \""], [109, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 89 \"Captain John Macleod,\" Lady Marget inter rupted the conversation peremptorily, \" will you allow me to tell you that I do not want to have one of my drawing-room chairs broken, seeing that I'll have to send as far as Edinbro' to get it matched? and you'll permit me to say, sir, that neither do I care you should scrape, with your heels, a hole in my new carpet.\" Macleod was disconcerted in spite of his official dignity and his natural stolidity. He sat up with an awkward laugh and a \"No offence, madam,\" while he drew in his legs and shuffled his feet by way of atonement. Flora came to his relief. \" My dear Lady Marget,\" she said in privileged remonstrance, \" Captain Mac leod is sitting on the stoutest chair in the room. As for his feet doing harm on the carpet, I wish you saw mine, which you would not allow me to change ! \" and she looked down comically, not without a grain of coquetry in her candour, at her country-made shoes. They could not altogether conceal the trimness of the feet they clothed, but they bore unmistakable traces of the wet walk from Ormiclade to the shore. Lady Marget laughed. \"You were doing my bidding, miss ; and what is the world coming to if a smatchet like you is to give me a lesson in manners ? \" Captain John was clearly propitiated by the diver sion made in his favour, still he returned to the charge. \"By what boat did you cross the Minch, Miss Mac donald ? I may explain,\" he went on to say, with evident wholesome fear of Lady Marget's interference, \"that it is not from idle curiosity I put these questions. I am bound to do it with regard to the instructions I have in my mind.\""], [110, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 90 \"Oh, dear no, I never thought it was from idle curiosity,\" said Flora, meeting his explanation with disarming readiness, \" but just to learn whether I came over in a proper fashion, which has nothing to do with anything contraband. Well, sir, Clanranald was so obliging as to let me have one of his boats with his boatmen, because the times are so unsettled, and the Minch is so crowded with cutters and sloops of the line and their boats. As for the Islands them selves, they are that over-run with preventive men and parties of soldiers, my mother thought it was not right for a young woman like me, to stay on with Angus at Milton. She had the notion it would be better for me to be at home with her at Armadale, so she got my step-father to grant me a passport (I can let you see it if you like) to take me and my servant, and a spinning-maid for my mother, to Skye \u2014 and here I am. And how are the bairns, my lady ? Is little Jamie as fine a wee man as ever ; and Alick and the baby ? \" \"All well, and very royd, my dear. But here you are \u2014 that is the great question, and heartily welcome to stay as long as we can keep you, to enliven our dullness,\" said Lady Marget, cordially, \" and there is the dinner-bell. If Captain John Macleod has finished his catechising to his satisfaction, I'll ask him to take you to the dining-room ; I can trust you to keep him in order, and to shut his mouth that he may not spoil your appetite with farther examples of his talent at cross-examination.\" Lady Marget's requests were commands in her own house ; there was nothing for it save to obey them. Flora had to accept the enemy's escort into the dining-room and to sit out the dinner, making herself agreeable all the time, while even her healthy nerves"], [111, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 91 were thrilling with apprehension. She was in a fever of longing to tell her tale to somebody who could help her, somebody who could convey a warning to the Prince to keep him from walking straight into the tiger's jaws. Good heavens ! What if he wearied of sitting drumming his knuckles on Flora's trunk, and came of his own accord to the house, trusting to the good will and good offices of Lady Marget \u2014 Lady Marget who knew nothing of his predicament ? There was one good thing, Captain John Macleod was safer by her side than he would have been anywhere else in the room, or the house. She had him under her eye, and she might still farther talk him round, and get the better of him. Another comfort was that, just as Lady Marget took her place at the head of the table, a gentleman who had not been present before then, entered and took his place at the foot. His appearance was a glad sight to Flora. The arrival of Sir Alexander, the master of the house and her chief, could hardly have brought to her a more blissful reaction of hope and encouragement. The new-comer was an old friend of the family's, and of Flora's. He was a middle-aged, stout, sensible man, being Alexander Macdonald of Kingsbarrow, Sir Alexander's factor, chamberlain, factotum, who took the master of the house's place when Sir Alexander was absent from Skye, and when he was present, repaired to Edinburgh, and managed the business of the estate there. He was a man of tried experience and sagacity, who could keep his head, hold his tongue, and find a way out of the worst labyrinth, if anybody could. The third ray of light through the mist of trouble was drawn from the fact that Ewan of the Pipes came in as usual, and began to march up and down"], [112, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 92 behind the backs of the company at dinner. The din he raised served to mask and drown much of the talk at table, so that there was an excuse for not maintaining a continous flow of conversation, and for not catching every observation and answering to the point on the moment. But Flora had not yet done with the inquisitor let loose upon her, in the person of the cavaUer Lady Marget had given her. He had smoothed his brows, no doubt, and was prepared to enter into friendly communication with her, and to be entertained by her spirit and vivacity, but even in this light he had not the tact to avoid debateable topics. One of the first remarks he made to her was in reference to the last news from Long Island, and what had been heard of \" Prince Charles, the Young Pretender.\" Racked as Flora was with fear and care for the person in question, she could not resist making a mischievous rejoinder. \" Sir, I am free to confess I'm a bit of a Jacobite myself,\" she said audaciously. \" Therefore I'm glad to understand the unfortunate young gentleman you're interested in, is well on his way to France.\" Macleod looked at her baffled and bewildered. Lady Marget asked Flora's next neighbour to carve the fowls on the dish before him. He prided himself on his possession of one of the social accomplishments of the day \u2014 dexterous carving. Thus, inadvertently enough, he was put in the height of good humour by a request which enabled him to show his skill. Flora felt that all was fair in love and war, and that she was quite justified in paying him a compli ment on the neatness and despatch with which he cut up the fowls. His confidence and geniality \u2014 such as he could"], [113, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 93 claim \u2014 were fully restored. Presently he addressed Lady Marget with an ease which amounted to affability. \"Is there much ground game about, my lady?\" \" I am at a loss to know exactly what you reckon ground game in these parts,\" answered Lady Marget, carelessly; \"but at the little loch at Callum Cille, which is at our elbow, there are heaps on heaps of wild ducks and geese and swans, if they will serve for an answer to your question.\" Flora saw and snatched at the opportunity. \" You mind Niel MacEachan \u2014 the man who is my far away cousin, and serves as my attendant to Arma dale, Lady Marget ? \" she asked impulsively, with sparkling eyes. \"Are you aware that he is a grand shot ? If he had the use of a fowling-piece given him, it would not only be the greatest treat to him, he might fill your larder in no time.\" \" He may take what he can find in the gun-room,\" said Lady Marget, a little surprised at Flora's eager ness for the display of MacEachan's excellence as a shot. But Flora was not daunted by her hostess's lack of interest in the subject. She spoke over her shoulder to one of the men who was waiting at table. \" You hear what Lady Marget says, Alister ? Will you see Niel, let him have a gun, and be sure to tell him to do credit to my recommendation? \" The dinner-guests dispersed. The ladies prepared to follow Lady Marget to the drawing-room. Captain John Macleod and some of his subalterns set out to walk to Uig to look after their men. (Ob, happy chance, when their absence was so much more desirable than their company.) Kingsbarrow went"], [114, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 94 to the business-room, where he was engaged with the accounts of a great estate. Flora could see, by a side glance out of a corridor window', Niel MacEachan armed with a gun, losing no time in hurrying along the birch avenue. \" Smarten your heels, Niel, my man,\" she said to herself, \"run, as for your life, the moment you're out of sight of the house. You never had such reason for speed in all your born days.\" For well did she know that it was not to shoot wild swans or geese that Niel was bound. She could guess that while he shouldered the gun for a blind, he had waited for neither flint, nor powder and shot. He did not want them where his errand led him \u2014 not to Callum Cillie, but to the Prince, to tell him what company were at the house before him, and bid him \" ware off\" till further intimation was given him. Here was an opening for Flora to break the news of the stranger at the gates to Lady Marget, but when the moment came Flora shrank from the responsibility. Well as she knew the great lady, possibly just because she knew her so well, Flora recoiled from the difficult task of first startling her patroness by the shock of her information, and then of seeking to guide her. Flora could not tell what Lady Marget might or might not do in her excitement, something reckless and daft-like, with the best intentions, sufficient to work irreparable mischief to all concerned. \" No, no,\" the girl de clined the commission, \" somebody older and wiser than me, who can manage her, must undertake it. Kingsbarrow is the man, it is for him to do it.\" Accordingly Flora made an excuse of wishing to see Kingsbarrow in order to remind him that he had promised her a recipe for an ailing horse at"], [115, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 95 Armadale. She left Lady Marget and Mrs. Macdonald Kirkiebost with the youngest of the militia officers in the drawing-room, and repaired to the business room \u2014 hardly waiting to give an importunate knock at the door. \" Come in,\" cried Kingsbarrow's muffled voice, for he held a pen between his big square teeth. The next instant she was at the side of his littered table, grasping the arm of his chair to support herself. \"Oh! Kingsbarrow, something fearsome has be fallen us,\" she whispered in his ear. \" Who should be here but the Prince himself? He came over with me in woman's clothes from Benbecula. He's lying under the brow of the brae, at the landing here \u2014 no farther off. What is to be done ? For mercy' sake bestir yourself, sir,\" cried the impatient girl, as Kingsbarrow sat transfixed, without even removing the pen from his teeth, only changing in colour from a hale red, first to an oppressed purple, and then to a muddy white. \" If you fail him,\" urged Flora, \"he's undone ; you must tell Lady Marget, and then we must lay our heads together and find a place to put him in, while we -keep Captain John and his crew off the scent, till we get his Royal Highness transported elsewhere.\" \"Preserve us all ! Flora Milton,\" said Kingsbarrow at last, rousing himself and pushing back his wig, \" this is a bad business. If it get wind, it may ruin us stoup and roup \u2014 and the estate is only beginning to win on its feet again \u2014 forby costing a royal lad his head, I take it. This is no time for putting questions, or I might be asking you what the Deil tempted you to bring the Prince here ? \" \" We were at our wits' end,\" apologized Flora ;"], [116, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 96 \"but indeed and indeed there will be no time for putting questions. John Macleod, Balmeonach put enough to me, if you had heard him, all the time of dinner. It is you who will inform Lady Marget, Kingsbarrow.\" \"Well \u2014 a \u2014 well, Flora Milton,\" acquiesced the worthy gentleman, rising deliberately from his chair. \" Something is bound to be done without delay, and so far as it rests with me, I'll do my best ; but I'm free to say that you've not hesitated to impose on me the most ticklish job of all.\" And a twinkle of humour crossed the trouble in his brown eyes. \"You'll help so far, you'll send Lady Marget here. Tell her I am concerned to disturb her, but I crave the favour of speech with her, in private, for a few minutes. She'll think there is word from Sir Alexander, and she's fain to have her fine lady's hand in the pie where his business is concerned, which I will tell you in confidence, Flora, my dear, is not always to our profit. But we might be a deal worse off than with Lady Marget, 'deed might we. She's a fine woman, and she has the interests of the house and the Island at heart, if she only kenned how best to serve them. We're all proud of her ladyship, whatever, and it is our duty to defer to her and speak her fair.\" Presently Flora was able to send Lady Marget sailing into the business-room, and dropping into the easiest chair, for her interview with the factor, while the girl took care to keep herself out of the way. \" Now, what is the matter Kingsbarrow? \" inquired her ladyship with dignity, and without any conscience prick or sense of alarm. \"I'll take the first word of flytin',\" Kingsbarrow had been making the pawky suggestion to himself."], [117, "THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 97 \" That will bring madam down an inch or two from her high horse, before I launch this thunderbolt at her head.\" \"It does not become me, Lady Marget,\" began the factor \" to question any step your ladyship chooses to take,\" and as he spoke he ostentatiously arranged the papers on the table before him, as if to avoid looking the lady in the face, and bringing a blush of confusion to her cheek; \"but may I ask if you have been so rash as to be opening a communication with a person who shall be nameless ? \" \" You never spoke a truer word than that, Kings barrow, it does not become you to question any step I may choose to take,\" cried Lady Marget, swallowing the bait, and firing up on the spot, with the grand \" Eglintoun air \" paramount in her handsome person. \"But I'll tell you, for your edification, that I have opened a communication \u2014 as you are pleased to call it \u2014 with my prince, the lawful Prince of Wales, in his tribulation. I've writ him a letter of sympathy, and such advice as I could take it upon me to proffer, and sent it with my allegiance \u2014 where was there ever a Montgomerie who was not loyal ? \u2014 by the sure hand of Captain Donald Macleod of Galtrigal, whose packet brought the Prince over from the mainland to the Long Island. What else could I do, and what for should I not do it ? \" she demanded with haughty defiance. \" Then, madam, I presume you're ready to drink as you've brewed,\" Kingsbarrow set himself to clinch his argument, and deal his blow, \"for if not, what will you say when I tell you the Prince is here, in Skye, at our Kilbryde landing, not a quarter of a mile from where we're sitting ? \" Lady Marget started up in the wildest disorder, uttering a loud scream of dismay. ii"], [118, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 98 \" You do not say so, Kingsbarrow\u2014 never, never ! This is more than Sir Alexander and me bargained for. What have I brought upon us ? What\u2014 what shall we do?\" \" Whatever you do, Lady Marget, there is to be no more skirling. Though we were all kiUed outright\u2014 and we're nigh hand to dead men already \u2014 you're not to give another skirl \" \u2014 Kingsbarrow was forced to take the upper hand \u2014 \"you'll fetch the whole house about you. The very offisher lads will be running to see if the lift has fallen, or the kitchen lum is a-lowe.\" CHAPTER VIII. 14 Blythe, blythe and merry was she, Blythe was she, but and ben.\" BURN'S. As soon as Lady Marget had regained a little com posure, Flora and Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, were called into the consultation, upon the principle that in the multitude of councillors there is wisdom. But Kingsbarrow had a private conviction that if there was a mouthful of common sense and intrepidity to be found among the three ladies, it lay with Flora Milton. He had no man to whom he could apply, in the strait, save that half-foreign feather-headed creature Niel MacEachan, who was up to his eyes in Jacobite plots and schemes, with nothing to lose save his own craig, which at the best was hanging by its last lith. Lady Marget was set on sending post haste for Captain Donald Roy, a cadet of the Monkstadt family who had been in arms, on the wrong side, at Culloden,"], [119, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 99 where he was wounded in the knee. He had the wit afterwards to give himself up to the nearest magis trate, and was now at large, staying some miles off, having his injured knee attended to. Kingsbarrow, though he would be thankful for an other man-body to bear him company, dreaded that the summons would attract attention, and considered it was only bringing a poor disabled gentleman into farther trouble, with little hope of good from his presence. Flora was bent on despatching another messenger, and one bearing some weight with him, to the Prince, to reassure him and dissuade him from making any move on his own account. Of the propriety of this measure and of its being incumbent within the hour, before Captain John Macleod and his subordinates could have time to come back from Uig, there was little room for doubt \u2014 so little that Kingsbarrow at once volunteered to dis charge the mission, and sallied forth, with as easy and disengaged a gait as he could assume, to find the fugitive. It was easier said than done. There was no Prince in the hoUow under the hill, though Flora's trunk still stood there, forgotten. Kingsbarrow looked round him in fresh consterna tion, but his coolness and sagacity did not forsake him. There was a flock of black-faced sheep scurry ing in their usual timid, silly fashion round a corner of the hill. Now, sheep are, of all animals, the most foolish in being scared at anything or nothing ; but as the factor stood with his hand over his eyes to shade them from the single blink of the sun, which shone through the driving clouds that day, or behind his ear to catch the most distant echo of sound, he"], [120, "\u25a0\u2022 THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 100 could detect neither dog nor fox in pursuit, and he tramped off in the direction of the sheep. Sure enough, as the moorland rose beyond a dip in the ground, he had not gone more than a few paces when he came in sight of what had alarmed the sheep with reason, the strange figure of a big woman loom ing in gigantic outline against the misty grey sky, and idly flourishing round her head a rough stick which some shepherd had abandoned, and the stranger had picked up. \" Gude guide us, will that worriecow ever be king of Great Britain and Leland ? \" Kingsbarrow asked himself, not unnaturally, as he peered inquisitively at the extraordinary object before him, \"and will I make a spune instead of spoiling a horn, and be invited to Holyrood or St. James's to be created a bauronet, like Sir Alexander, or be infest in some of the Whig's forfeited lands which would be better worth a plain man's going to court for, in return for this day's work ? I trow it is a hantle likelier I'll have to take to the moors and the hillsides myself \u2014 me, with a rheumatic shouther, or to fly the country, leaving my wife and family behind me, when I have not even been so far as Holland, and cannot speak so much as a word of the High Dutch. Or I'll have to lie in the common room of a common jile, with no appetite for prison parritch, because of my Lady Marget's cantrips, and because that clever compas sionate young hizzie, Flora Milton, had courage to do Clanranald's bidding, and humanity to succour a man in his need.\" Kingsbarrow was forced to own, however, when he made known his identity, and entered into conversa tion with the Prince, that he was a fearless chield, with a manner \" grander \" in its graciousness than"], [121, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 101 Lady Marget's in its imperiousness \u2014 which no dis guise could affect, and he was more ready to listen to common sense than could have been expected in his father's son and his grandfather's grandson. When he was told that he must return to the hole under the brae, where provisions and blankets would be sent to him, for his solace during the night, while his friends kept guard over the militia in the great house, and planned how he was to evade their notice and depart unseen next day, he acquiesced without much difficulty. Kingsbarrow's errand done, every farther step in the business had to be deferred until Captain John and his junior officers should return from Uig, be entertained at supper, and disposed of in bed, for the night which they were to spend at Monkstadt. The card-tables had to be set out, and games of loo and basset started. Lady Marget might be at liberty, after a while, to sit apart, sniff at a vinaigrette, and make much of a violent headache. Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, might plead that she was not so young as she had been, and was just come off a fatiguing journey, considering the state of the weather. But there was nothing left for Flora save to exert herself to the utmost. She had to take a hand in the games, and play her hand with spirit and skill. She had to sit down to Lady Marget's spinet, and sing her Highland songs, at the bidding and for the gratification of the enemy \u2014 to-night. For these very militia had been her allies last month, and might be her allies again in a month to come. Her step-father was one of the militia officers \u2014 nay, Allan Kingsbarrow still held a com mission in a regiment of the line, under the Whig government. It was the commission he had got at"], [122, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 102 the time young Clanranald received his, and Allan had not thrown up his obligations, in order to follow Prince Charlie, after the fashion of his friend. The whole country was entangled in a net-work of com plicated relations and conflicting claims, which it is necessary to understand in order to do full justice to all the parties engaged in the conflict.* Flora had to help to send round the \" toasts \" and \"sentiments\" after supper. When Ewan the Piper sent forth melodious screeches from the hall, summon ing the company to join him, that they might dance \"a three-some reel\" or two, before they parted for the night, Flora had to stand up with Captain John and another man, and to execute her best steps for their benefit. \" Well done, Flora Milton,\" said Kingsbarrow in her ear, as she passed him, while he houched and snapped his fingers in chorus. \"You are the lass at a pinch.\" And again, when the turn of the flying dance brought her round to his side once more, \"I will tell my son Allan when he comes home, that he himself could not have done better, in flinging dust in his neighbours' eyes.\" Flora's red cheeks burned scarlet, and tbe brown lashes fell, for a second, over the steel-blue eyes, which were flashing so brightly under the strain of effort and excitement. The next moment when the dance was over, and flora was at liberty to linger, for a breathing space, \u2022 As an example of the amicable manner in which Whig and Tory neighbours sometimes agreed to differ, it is said Sir Alexander Mac donald assured Macleod of Raasay that he \u2014 Sir Alexander \u2014 would do the best he could for him, if the Prince's campaign failed, and should the island of Baasay be seized, in spite of every precaution, and brought into the market, Sir Alexander further pledged himself to buy it back for the family."], [123, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 103 apart with her old friend, she told him, with a shake of her long waving curls \u2014 \" Flinging dust in folks' eyes is not a very safe accomplishment, Kingsbarrow, and it is not one I admire or am fond of practising, so that you need say nothing about it to Allan. When it comes to that he could not do it so well, no, nor half so well as I, though it is not an accomplishment that I take any credit for. Allan may be a strapping soldier, but I should say that stratagems which are not far removed from rogue's tricks, are not in his line.\" \" I declare Flora Milton is growing a regular beauty,\" one of the militia officers remarked admir ingly to his comrades. \" I have heard a great work made about the beauty of her cousin, the young heiress of Kilmossie, but I was never told that Mistress Flora here was anything out of the common, except that she had the Highland music, and no end of the gift of the gab.\" \"Mistress Flora would not be amiss if she did not want the penny siller \u2014 that makes an odds in the world's estimation of a lady's charms,\" said Captain John, condescendingly, but with a dash of super ciliousness grafted on his doggedness ; \"as for her fair tongue I would have been more than a match for her, if there had been any mischief brewing.\" The stalwart defenders of the island from native rebels and foreign invaders had swallowed their \"night-cans\" \u2014 that is, tossed off their last drams for the night, and were consigned to the simple sleeping accommodation for single gentlemen with which Monkstadt was provided. This was in the shape of numerous pigeon-holes of bedrooms, which boasted no farther luxuries than pallet beds, cans of water, boot-jacks, and such three-inch looking-glasses"], [124, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 104 for hanging on the wall as could be bought at Portree fair ; the seal was set on the gentlemen's retirement by the appearance of a pair of huge nail-studded boots yawning before each closed door. Assurance was rendered doubly sure by a lusty snore or two issuing from the sleepers' narrow bounds. The whole rambling house of Monkstadt was sunk in twilight darkness, and what passed for profound repose. Then the conspirators began to steal from their different quarters, and to resort to Lady Marget's room as the safest rallying-ground under the circum stances, for the purpose of holding such a council of war as had been held at Ormiclade only two nights before. When it came to that, these councils, met together at the dead of night, had been the rule and not the exception, in a hundred places, throughout the troubled country in this ill-fated year. Captain Donald Roy, who had arrived on his pony at one of the back entrances to the house, was smuggled limping along the corridors. Niel MacEachan, the one born conspirator there, crept up from the servants' regions. Kingsbarrow, in his stocking soles because he was a heavy man, and his tread was heavy, made his way from the business-room. Lady Marget received the company. She sat wrapped in her roquelaire to defend her from the cold, though there was a wood fire burning on the hearth, and the room was sumptuously furnished in the matter of its curtains, cushions, and screens compared with any other room in the house. But the air was sharp, even on a summer night in Skye, and the thick folds of the mantle could not overcome the nervous shivers which ran through the lady who wore it."], [125, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 105 Flora was still in the white muslin frock which she had selected from the wardrobe she kept for convenience' sake at Monkstadt. She had worn it in the evening to replace the suspiciously soiled riding-habit, and to do elaborate honour to \"the militia gentlemen.\" But- she was in no danger of feeling cold. Her young blood was coursing too swiftly through her veins. Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, was no better than a cipher, but she had done her best and could be trusted, which was more than could be said of most ciphers, poor body ! There was something un pleasantly suggestive of a corbie or a howdie-craw about the rusty black of her widow's weeds, but she could not help that, and it would be a shame to let superstition punish her on that account. It was a curiously mixed assemblage \u2014 whether as a council of peace or of war \u2014 almost as bizarre as the grotesque figure huddled in the blankets, down in the cave by the sea-shore, on whose behalf the gathering met, risking their lives and liberties. The question was settled chiefly by Kingsbarrow, whose natural solidity and sagacity could not be up set, and by Captain Donald Roy, a man worn and spent with pain and sickness, but fully alive to the exigencies of the situation, and not deficient in resource. Occasionally Flora offered a modest suggestion as it struck her, and whenever she spoke, Kingsbarrow listened with marked attention, because he was prepared to testify that she was not only a creature \"gleg of the uptak,\" she was endowed with ordi nary thoughtfulness and prudence for her sex and years. Had she not been the main instrument in smoothing away every difference between her brother"], [126, "106 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" Milton and their step-father, Captain Hugh of Armadale \u2014 good men both, but occupying the awk ward position towards each other, of step-father still in his prime and step-son of mature years, since Marian Macdonald of South Uist had entered on her first marriage when she was little better than a \" lassock.\" Niel MacEachan, too, spoke to the point, without putting himself forward, of what the Prince was fit for, and got the hearing he was entitled to, though Kingsbarrow was prejudiced by the foreign element which had become second nature with the young man, and by the role of adventurer which stuck to him. Donald Roy also eyed askance the Prince's personal retainer. Was he not one of the group, Irish chiefly, who had been with his Royal Highness on his land ing, whose undue influence had wrecked the whole enterprise? Lord George Murray had defied the Prince's old governor Sheridan, and 0' Sullivan, to their faces, in the presence of their master, after the defeat at Culloden. Lord George had hotly con demned the manner in which 0' Sullivan had marshalled the troops in the field, and had thrown up his\u2014 Lord George's \u2014 commission sooner than serve under so imcompetent a general of the forces. Donald Roy went with \"Gallant Murray,\" and pinned his faith to \" Geordie's sel',\" * while here was another of the original culprits taking it upon him to advise them in their dead-lock ! But the keen, brown face, biding its time, was irresistible ; in the end, Mac- Eachan's counsel, which never failed either in boldness * \" Who will mount with Gallant Murray, Who will ride with Geordie's sel'?\" Old song."], [127, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 107 or in craftiness, was acceptable in the absence of more authoritative advice. Lady Marget, for once, had not her finger to any extent in the political pie. She was too conscience stricken, and too unnerved by the serious predicament into which she had helped to draw her husband, to be able to come to the front and rule with her woman's despotism, as was her wont. Had not the German bully Cumberland, in a. rage at the Prince's escape, already hailed Sir Alexander with the rude taunt, \" Here you come, my Lord of the Rebels.\" On which the insulted gentleman had not waited to weigh his words, before he had thrown back the taunt with as good as had been given to him. \" No, my Lord Duke, if I had been the Lord of the Rebels, instead of the Lord of the Isles, you and yours would never have crossed the Spey.\" What might not the Hanoverian Butcher say and do if he discovered that the prey which he had coveted, had been harboured, and sped on his way, by the wife and household of one of the gentlemen in the Duke's train ? Kingsbarrow could not be too grateful to Lady Marget for her temporary meekness. He was so much obliged to her for suppressing herself, that he felt inclined to regard with favour the only two mild petitions which she was moved to make. On second thoughts it was found impossible to gratify her wish that the Prince should be introduced into the Monk stadt gardens, and established, for his greater comfort during what was left of the summer night, or rather morning, in the Dutch summer-house. But surely, as she had pled with most unusual diffidence, it might be contrived, even though she should not have speech with the Prince, that she should set eyes on him."], [128, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 108 She regarded him as her future king. She retained her faith that he would one day wear the crown of these realms, which for more than half a century had been wrested from his race and ill-bestowed on aliens and usurpers. She was running a great risk for him. He was the idol of nine-tenths of the women of Scotland who had gone \" wud \" about him. And was she not to behold him ? It was Flora who interposed and earnestly dis suaded her ladyship from gratifying the natural impulse. \" Do not try to see him, Lady Marget, not even through a peep-hole. It may be a great satisfaction to both you and Sir Alexander in the future, if you can say and swear, with a clear con science, that you never set mortal eyes on him. I kept out of his way as long as I could, up to last night, when we had to forgather, and if it was an object with me for the sake of Milton and Captain Hugh, how much more to you who have so many more depending on your discretion ? You have to go up to London and maintain Sir Alexander's credit with the government, and appear at court. Oh ! do not cumber yourself with a knowledge which, like a secret ill to keep, will hang like a millstone round your neck.\" \" Hearken to the lass ! \" cried Kingsbarrow, with strong approval, \"Flora Milton's long head puts our men's brains to shame. Take her advice, Lady Marget, for Gude sake, for Sir Alexander's and your own.\" It was fixed finally, just as the wan watery sunrise was breaking through the dusk of the summer night, that Kingsbarrow should take the initiative. He had judiciously announced, over-night, at the supper-table"], [129, "\" THE .MACDONALD LASS.\" 109 that he was wanted away at his house of Kings barrow. If he could not make out the twelve miles' distance before the small hours had come and gone \u2014 a hint that might prevent any late or early stir in the household which chanced to rouse the sleepers, from being particularly noticed \u2014 he must even break the Sabbath day, so far as walking home in the course of the morning, was concerned. In reality Kingsbarrow was to pick up the Prince on starting, and conduct him, by out-of-the-way cattle tracks and moorland paths, to the factor's house at Kingsbarrow. In the meantime Captain Donald Roy was to mount his pony, and ride, by break of day, the twenty miles to Portree, there to bespeak the help of young Raasay. The Macleods of Raasay had followed the artlessly adroit plan by which so many poor Highland chiefs and Lowland lairds had sought to \"hedge \" in the expression of their principles, in order to leave a loop-hole by which they might retain their family estates. Young Raasay had stayed \" in \" with the government, while his father, brother, cousin, and the rest of their branch of the clan had gone \" out \" with the Prince in the recent rebellion. Raasay, it was thought, could procure a boat which would carry the hunted man across \u2014 either to the Island of Raasay, or to one or other of the smaller and more overlooked islands of the Hebrides. It was high time that his Royal Highness should be withdrawn from Skye. In the meanwhile Kingsbarrow had ascertained that there had already been wild talk in the Monkstadt kitchen. It had its origin in the credulous terror of a young shepherd who would not be silent with regard to a \" muckle woman \" he had seen on the moor, and down by the shore. She"], [130, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 110 was so muckle and so unlike other Kilmuir \"kimmers\" that he had been driven to the con clusion she must be one of the descendants of the great race of Finn, as a rule held under a spell, and kept prisoners by dwarfish pigmies, in the rocky recesses beneath the stone of Diarmid. Flora's part was cut out for her, and was shown presently, when she reappeared, after two sleepless nights, as fresh as a rose, at the Monkstadt breakfast table. She was like a half-wild, hardy, sweet Scotch rose. Its perfume is all the more exquisite because of a certain keenness in the faint fleeting sweetness of its scent, which is not heavy and oppressive like the odour of the southern roses. Lady Marget did not dare to keep her room, as she had a habit of doing of a morning, she was in her place behind the steaming urn. But her guests were compelled to come to the conclusion that the fine lady had been attacked by the vapours, or the megrims, or some other aristocratic ailment, so \" dowf \" was she in her stateliness. Flora Milton formed a great contrast to her hostess. Flora's sprightly tongue wagged like a kail-bell. What descriptions were yon she gave of the last otter-hunt at which she was present, and of the quarrel and fight of the Sleat drovers on the Armadale shore of the Sound ! It was as good as reading a printed book to listen to her ; nay, it was better, for her eyes, her lips and her hands afforded such lively notes on what she was saying as no printed pages could supply. She kept the company lingering over the breakfast-table, till half of the lads had to snatch up their bonnets and plaids and run to be in time for the parish kirk, at which a contingent of the regiment was bound to be seen."], [131, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 111 CHAPTER IX. 44 Wat, wat, wat and weary.\" Old Song. At last Flora sat back sedately in her chair, and said she had been forgetting what day it was, and that she and Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, must be taking the road, if they were to reach their respective desti nations by sundown. Lady Marget woke up from her languor to accom plish a feint of opposing her visitors' intention, and pressing them to stay and bear her company. They would not be journeying on the Sabbath day, would they ? They would not be leaving her her lone, save for the bairns and the gentlemen ? They ought to stay over that day and the next, have another round game, and another reel to Ewan's pipes. They might even make a week of it, if they would take pity on her lonesomeness, in Sir Alexander's long absence. Lady Marget spoke feelingly, and she must have been suffering from the irksomeness and worry of keeping house at Monkstadt by herself, for there was not only wistfulness, there was a strain of trepidation in the manner in which she begged the two ladies to remain with her. Captain John Macleod, who was not one of the church-goers, took it upon him to second Lady Marget's entreaty. \" You might stay at least over this day and the next, Miss Macdonald, and if there will be nothing of consequence occurring to-morrow,\" he blustered, \" we might make time to have out Sir Alexander's otter hounds, with the permission of her ladyship here,\""], [132, "112 \" THE aM AC DONALD LASS.\" he added as an afterthought, \" and try a hunt up as far as the Callum.\" But Flora was smilingly obdurate. \" I would be blithe to stay with you till you tired of me, Lady Marget, you know that well ; and it would be grand fun to be in another otter-hunt, Captain John, but sickness, like necessity, has no law. There will be my poor mother always complaining at Armadale, and if she should hear I'm in Skye, she will be thinking I should not lose a minute in being with her to nurse her, aud to look after the house and my step-father, and the young children.\" \" That's true, Flora, and I cannot keep you from your mother.\" Lady Marget gave way with unex pected celerity. \" I knew you would understand,\" Flora hastened to say; \" so now, Captain John, if you will oblige me so far, you'll bid them bring the beasts to the door, and see that the girths and straps are secure, for you ken it is rough riding in Skye.\" Flora had breakfasted in her riding-habit, Mrs. Macdonald had her skirt waiting for her in the hall. The leave-taking, however cordial, was not protracted. It was clear Flora Milton had made up her mind to be gone, and she was not the woman to let the grass grow between her purposes and their execution. Captain John Macleod would have lifted her into her saddle, had she not been too quick for him. She sprang into her seat before he could reach her, with his somewhat lumbering and pompous service. He was reduced to bestowing his polite attentions on Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, who was less light and buoyant in her movements than her companion showed herself. There was the usual small cavalcade of attendant gillies which was the invariable accompaniment of a"], [133, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 113 riding-party in which ladies figured, where riding and boating were the only means of travelling to any distance, save for the humblest classes. Carriage roads for vehicles of more pretensions than carriers' carts, were awaiting the advent of General Wade. On at least two important occasions in her eventful life, Flora rode on horse-back from Inverness to the west coast, and from one end of Skye to the other. The attendants in this case, consisted of the ubiquitous Niel MacEachan, a gillie Mrs. Macdonald had brought with her from Kirkiebost, and another complimentary gillie sent from Monkstadt to see the ladies fairly on their way. The party had not long started when the rain, which is so familiar a feature of the weather in Skye that the natives are accustomed to treat it with scanty consideration, set in again, with renewed determina tion, in a steady unrelenting down-pour. Nothing could be drearier than the brown moors and olive bogs soaking even on a fine day, with mountain peak and range shut out by mist as if they were not in existence. However indifferent the hardy country people and their hardy ponies were to such daily deluges, it might have been thought that to a young lady they would not be quite so harmless and unre pellant. On the contrary, Flora was cheerfully telling Mrs. Macdonald Kirkiebost that the weather could not be finer, the rain was most seasonable and propitious. Soon you would not be able to see your hand before you. Accordingly, instead of turning off with Niel on the track leading to Sleat and Armadale, Flora went on as if she were a kelpie, enjoying the pleasure of a drenching, not only bearing the other traveller company, but deliberately selecting, and causing her to select, the roundabout route to Kingsbarrow which 1"], [134, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 114 Kingsbarrow's master and the Prince were under stood to have pursued in the morning. The truth was that Flora having done her duty as a decoy to the militia officers, and being now assured that she was beyond their observation, was accom plishing the second part of the programme which had been sketched out for her. She was doing her best to come up with Kingsbarrow and the Prince, in order to go on with them and give them the benefit of her services so long as they were needed. Poor douce, pawky Kingsbarrow ! He would have his hands filled with the wild regardless young Prince \u2014 and she was not going to leave another of her old friends, Allan Kingsbarrow's father too, in the lurch, any more than she would, abandon the task which Clanranald had entrusted to her when it was only half fulfilled. \" Flora Milton, I've a great desire to arrive at something, and you may be able to tell me how to get it.\" Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost's, somewhat chirping and peaking voice rose up in the midst of the drizzling rain and desolate surroundings, and broke in on Flora's reverie. \" What's your will, Mrs. Macdonald ? \" asked Flora, briskly. \" HowT can I give you a pleasure ? \" \" You're very complacent, Flora Milton ; you've the name of being everybody's body.\" The speaker corroborated Lorraine Macdonald's evidence on the same point. \" You're a stand-by to your friends. What miss or madam in the kiugdom could have ettled to do what you've carried through, within the last couple of days and nights ? And you're very good to the rest of the world who are not so clever and strong as j'ou are.\" \" I've to thank you heartily for your good opinion,"], [135, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 115 ma'am,\" said Flora, wondering what the compliments were leading to. \" You see, Flora, the same arguments which were addressed to my Lady Marget do not apply to me, who am not a great lady, but just the widow of a dhuinne wassel. 'Deed that was the reason why I was chosen to bring over the message from the North Uist. It was an honour, though it was likewise a great cumber and fright to me. It will be a still greater honour one never to be forgotten whatever, if we come up in time with Kingsbarrow and his charge. How I'm to bear myself I cannot think. But I put it to you, Flora Milton, will they ever believe me in the North Uist or at Kirkiebost, that I've been privileged to breathe the same air with his Royal Highness \u2014 no less ? They'll rather credit that I've given myself over to leeing, more by token that I cannot pretend to have seen so much as a feather of his tail.\" \"Eh, do not fash yourself about that, my dear Mrs. Macdonald ! \" Flora laughingly comforted the disturbed lady. \" You know his disguise ? Well, act as if you knew it not. I'll see that you ride next his Royal Highness \u2014 and all you have to do is to gowp and glower under his mutch and hood. He'll not mind or take offence. He's as fond of a joke and a laugh as any of his father's subjects \u2014 if they ever are his subjects, poor callant ! \u2014 can be. Why, he's only a laddie, Mrs. Macdonald, young and witless, after the manner of laddies, in spite of his fine bearing, and his spirit, and the troubles he has come through. There's the pity of it.\" The ladies came up with Kingsbarrow and the Prince, when they had halted at a well to rest and refresh themselves, with some of the provisions with which Kingsbarrow's pouches were stuffed. Even"], [136, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 116 with the elder man's knowledge of the ground, it would have been a case of \u2014 44 Water, water everywhere, And ne'er a drop to drink,\" if the pair had not stumbled on a herd-boy, who led them to a spring. He was rewarded by the younger traveller with the first silver shilling the boy had ever possessed. Kingsbarrow was in the act of having what he called \" an argle-bargle \" with the Prince on his un called-for generosity. \" To give the loon a siUer shilling, when a copper bawbee would have more than pleased him ! It was fair waste, sir, and it was calculate to call attention to one who is passing for a servant-lass, and yet has shillings to spare ! \" \"Good faith! if the gift of a shilling is to betray my state, I'm reduced indeed ! \" protested the Prince, taking the remonstrance in good part, but gladly hailing the re-appearance of Flora. She lectured him too, and would have none of his soft nothings, but she was a young and handsome woman who had rendered him a signal service. Kingsbarrow was serving him also \u2014 at the poor factor's peril: but tbe worthy gentleman was prosy, and he was not scrupling to put his Prince through a searching cross-examination with regard to his own and his royal father's prospects, in France and elsewhere in Europe. Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, like most of us, was con siderably bewildered and over-powered in having her desire granted. She could hardly take in the astound ing fact that the ill fa'ured randy \"Betty Burke,\" was none other than the handsome young Prince who"], [137, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 117 had turned the heads and won the hearts of the mass of the female population of these islands. For her part she was not even tempted to insist on kissing his hand, though she would have many a tale to tell of him when she reached Kirkiebost. He sat there very much at his ease under the cir cumstances, a philosophy which, no doubt, had something to do with his kingly descent. He talked glib English as it sounded to Mrs. Macdonald, with the introduction now and then, as if for practice, of one of the Gaelic sentences he had striven hard to acquire ; sometimes he threw over his shoulder to Niel MacEachan a word or two of French which, so far as Mrs. Macdonald comprehended it, might have been Greek or Latin. When he raised his quaich or drinking cup he glanced meaningly and jauntily at Niel, and said \"a, ses yeux noirs.\" Had the words been translated to her she would not have been any wiser, and neither Flora nor Kingsbarrow could follow him. Niel, to whom they were spoken, knew they were part of the play, like the references to St. James's. They were meant to keep up his followers' spirits and his own, by the covert mention of the royal bride, the daughter of France, who would share his throne with him \u2014 if there were a throne to share. Presently the weary trudge of what was left of the long twelve miles between Monkstadt and Kingsbarrow, began again.- The leader of the party did not wish to cut short the distance, since his plan was not to reach his house till after night-fall. Plodding on with aching feet, ill-protected by his old shoes, stumbling into boggy bits, \" speeling \" seal-dykes, crossing burns, in spate, on shaky stepping stones, teased and tormented by the woman's skirts"], [138, "118 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" which interfered with his walking, and the woman's mutch and hood which would fall over his eyes, Flora's kind heart bled for the Prince, who seemed somehow to I elong to her, in part, because of what she had undei taken on his behalf. She could have resisted every one of his courtly fascinations, but his destitution, his humiliation, his danger, his exhaustion, with the unshaken youthful courage which still bore up against the depth of adversity, smote down her womanly pride, her Whiggish principles and pro clivities. Flora's riding-habit might have been dipped in the sea and very inefficiently wrung out. Her long hair was hanging straight down her back, heavy laden with moisture. The plumes in her hat were limp and draggled. But she was wholly occupied with implor ing the Prince, at every solitary bit of the road, to consent to her alighting and walking a mile with Kingsbarrow, while his Royal Highness mounted her pony and thus pursued his journey. When he scouted the idea she wondered that Kingsbarrow could have the heart still to find fault with the poor fellow, though as the day wore on and his fatigue increased, it was both alarming and exasperating to see how his carelessness also increased, till he was nearly losing sight of the character he was personating. The road was lonely in the main, but in the wide circuit the party made, they approached more than one homely parish kirk just as it was \" scailin',\" with the congregation dispersing in every direction, the men in their blue bonnets and plaids, the women in similar plaids drawn well over their mutches and bare heads, and round their faces. Dismally wet as the day had been, with only the"], [139, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 119 most passing intermission in the constantly recurring rain, the weather had not greatly affected the zealous kirk-attenders in a calvinistically rigid locality. In proportion to their passion for kirk going, the Protestant contingent of the dwellers in Skye, are distinguished, to this day, by their vehement indig nation at any thing which savours to them of Sabbath desecration. Sabbath travelling, unless from kirk to kirk, at the time of the Tables, comes under this head. It must be confessed that the general air of Kings barrow's company did not recommend itself to these austere censors. The ladies on their horses were defrauding the poor beasts they rode of their clay of rest, which the riders were dishonouring for their pleasure. The poor gillies were sore misled and mis guided. A man of Kingsbarrow's years should have known better than to countenance, by his presence, an outrage on public propriety. But the most discreditable figure of all was the gypsy quean who was in the travellers' train. Kingsbarrow did his best to appease the prejudices, and smooth down the ruffled feelings of the critics. He knew many of them, and took care to accost them affably, and to enter into explanations that he was wanted at his house, and that he was escorting Miss Macdonald, Milton, and Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, who were equally wanted, the one to nurse her sick mother at Armadale, and the other to look after a pack of unruly servants at her farm of Kirkiebost, and as the weather was a thought sappy, he had persuaded them to break their journey, and spend the night, with his wife, at his place. Oh ! the big ungainly woman ? (Was she not a stugger ?) She was an Irish maid of Flora Milton's."], [140, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 120 She had brought her all the way from the Long Island by Captain Hugh's permit, and was taking her to Armadale, where she was to spin wool for the Captain's lady. He believed the woman was a rare spinner, if she was a randy to look at. Yes, indeed, she might be a man in woman's clothes, with her long stride and her kenspeckle ways, if Miss Mac donald were not there to vouch for her. But what signified Kingsbarrow's plausible speeches when the Prince would make a spectacle of him self? \" Sir, sir, wiU you curtshey and not bow ? and when you kilt your coats to wade across a bum, will you take tent not to kilt them up to the knee ? Grant us patience ! You're at the opposite extreme now. You're trailing your duds behind you, through the water, so that they'll cling to you for the rest of the road, like so many weet wisps which a drooket rotten would be affronted to drag at his heels.\" \"I appeal to you, Miss Macdonald, if 'a drooket rotten ' whatever that may be, is likely to be pestered with the burden of a woman's clothes.\" The Prince defended himself cheerfully. At last when the gloom of gathering night was added to the depression produced by the lowering clouds and the saturated earth, the long low house of Kingsbarrow presented itself. It was almost as dark as everything else, only a red spark, here and there, to indicate where a happed-up peat fire was keeping in the heat and the light till morning. The master of the house looked about him with satisfaction. \" They're all abed, mistress and maids and men, as I hoped. I'll call my wife, but we'll let sleeping dogs lie if we can, so that they may not be tempted to tell tales.\""], [141, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 121 He admitted himself and his company with as little noise as possible, and took them through the hall, but the house was not so entirely at rest as he had imagined. A little foot came pattering down the dark stairs. \" Father, daddy, have you come home ? \" cried a piping voice. \"Whisht! Whisht, you little restless speerit,\" enjoined the person thus addressed, as he made his way from the kitchen, bringing back a glowing peat between a pair of tongs, in order to light cruzies and candles. The glare revealed a little girl of nine or ten years in a printed calicot night-gown, with her short curls stuffed under a linen cowl, and a shy rosy face pressed against the fatherly legs which she was hugging tightly. \" What ! not ready to sleep for siller to buy a cow yet, Nanny ? \" said Flora, as to a familiar pet. \" Bairn, you'll catch your death of cold,\" cried the more matter-of-fact Mrs. Macdonald, who was child less in her house of Kirkiebost. It might be that the Sabbath night's \"questions\" had weighed too heavily on the child's brain, and kept her awake in her cot in the nursery, from which she had stolen. \" Run away, Nanny, and waken your mother,\" Kingsbarrow instructed the little messenger, \"but not a word to Ussie or Babby or the lave. Tell your mother I'm here, and have brought back company with me that she'll be blythe to welcome.\" The small bare feet trotted off obediently on their errand, and soon reached the chamber with its tartan carpet and box-beds, in one of which the mistress of Kingsbarrow lay, taking her well-earned rest, after"], [142, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 122 two diets of public worship and the Sabbath night's family catechising, over which she had presided in the absence of her spouse. \"Mother, mother, you're wanted,\" Nanny delivered her summons breathlessly. \"Father's down in the ha'. He's brought\" ever so many gentles back with him. Flora Milton's one of them.\" And the excited speaker executed a small skip of delight. \" Lassie,\" replied her mother, sitting up and blink ing sleepily under the broad borders of her thick white muslin night-cap, seen dimly by the feeble light of the cruzie, \"what are you saying? What for are you not in your crib, you little hempie, at this time of the night ? Your father here, do you say ? and company with him at this hour ? Well, he must see to them himself, whatever. No woman can be expected to rise out of her warm bed and entertain strange folk, in the middle of the night \u2014 the Sabbath night moreover. It will be some of Lady Marget's southern friends with their freits and fykes. Did you mention Flora Milton's name ? Well, then, there's my keys, take them to Flora, and she'll see that all is got which is wanted. Neither your father nor his company can desire much more than their beds at this chap of the knock, and I'm not going to stir to countenance any such unwarrantable proceedings.\" Mrs. Macdonald, Kingsbarrow, was not an inhospit able woman, but this was a most unreasonable call on her resources. She felt it the more keenly because she was accustomed to keep Kingsbarrow in good order. She was considerably his junior, a little woman, as sharp as a needle in her many virtues, voted as too sharp by some of her more sluggish and uncalculating compatriots. Flora liked her, without prejudice or partiality, knowing her to be true as"], [143, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 123 steel, and kind, under her pungent speech and brusque bearing. As for Mrs. Macdonald, she had a great respect for Flora \u2014 witness, the trust of the keys\u2014 indeed, in some lights, they were kindred spirits. \"But, mother, you maun come,\" urged Nanny, importunately. \"Father said, 'Waken mother and not the servant lasses,' and oh, mother, there's a great muckle beggar-wife, you never saw the like, going stalking where she will, through the house.\" \"What can your father be thinking of?\" cried Mrs. Macdonald, leaping from her bed at the alarm ing intimation. \" Idle gentry is bad enough, but clanjamphry of tramps picked up on the moors, is a hantle worse. She will be lifting something next. There are the sliders and the cruet, and father's tankard with the inscription, all on the sideboard.\" Stimulated by the danger which her active brain had called up, the mistress of the house hurriedly dressed herself in the wrapper and morning cap which came first to her hand, dismissed the reluctant Nanny summarily to her forsaken crib, and sallied forth to set matters to rights, and stem the disorder which had suddenly arisen in her domain. She found Kingsbarrow still busying himself, as quietly as he could manage it, in procuring rest and refreshment for his companions. But before she could get a private word with him to challenge him for his folly, before she could exchange civil greetings with the ladies, the big beggar-wife who had aroused Nanny's curiosity, strode out of a dusky corner, advanced before the ladies, took the astounded Mrs. Macdonald in her long arms, before the greeting could be prevented, and saluted her, while a man's beard rubbed the shrinking woman's cheek."], [144, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 124 \" Gude keep me. What is this ?\" she cried under her breath, and then her quick wit read the riddle. Only one man in hiding could take it upon him to do such a thing as a grace and an honour. She did not dispute the grace and the honour, but she realized that more was in jeopardy than the sliders, the cruet, and the tankard. She retreated towards the kitchen, and the moment she was out of sight and sound, wrung her hands and cried as so many had cried before her, that the family was undone. CHAPTER X. '\u2022 This morn is merry June, I trow, The rose is budding fain; But it shall bloom in winter's snow Ere we two meet again, my love, Ere we two meet again.\" Old Song. Mrs. Macdonald of Kingsbarrow's dismay at the discovery of who was the Sabbath-night's guest, did not hinder her from doing everything in her power to carry out her husband's wishes. No servant \u2014 maid, or man \u2014 was roused. Niel MacEachan and the gillies who had come with the party, stabled the ponies and foraged for their own needs, before retiring to the barn to be out of the way, and less likely to awaken the household. The hostess and the ladies who were her visitors, were at liberty to prepare the simple supper which was all they dared set before the stranger, while they softly stirred the great kitchen fire and dried the wettest of their garments in its glow. Mrs. Mac donald, Kingsbarrow, brought milk and cream and"], [145, "THE aMACDONALD LASS.\" 125 butter, and curds and whey from her dairy, and piled up the flouriest of her scones and the most massive of her oven cakes ; Flora boiled and \" cottered \" the eggs ; Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, sliced and toasted the cheese. To have attempted more, to have sought to prepare stronger meat or daintier fare would have been to waste time and to bring the servants about these amateur cooks by night, who might yet have to pay dearly for their cooking. Already the mistress of Kingsbarrow had called Flora's attention to a danger which she had hitherto overlooked. \" Clanranald's lady is an old gowk, and I am not very sure of Clanranald's self, to send you on such an errand. But did you let the Benbecula coofs go back yesterday, where they came from, with their boat ? \" interposed the wise woman, while Flora was recounting her adventures. \" Six fules of men to keep a great secret, Flora, my woman ! What were you thinking of? I would have credited you with more mother-wit than that comes to.\" \" Mercy ! \" cried Flora. \" What have I done ? \" stopping short, and still balancing her egg-pan on the ribs of the grate, in consternation at the blunder she had committed. \" I thought I had been so clever, and yet I forgot that.\" \"And ilka man's wife will have beguiled the story out of her man by this time,\" remarked. Mrs. Mac donald, Kingsbarrow, dryly ; ' ' and ilka wife will have bragged to her kimmers of her husband's fine doings, while there are John Macleod of Balmeonach, Allan of the Knock, and Captain Fergusson with his cutter, all on the alert, as you're telling me, and him in yonder to be condemned to be the victim of a wheen idle tongues.\""], [146, "126 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" \"Oh, Mrs. Macdonald, I am sorry,\" said poor Flora, piteously hanging her proud head, till her judge took pity on her discomfiture. \" Never mind. The mischief is done, and greetin' over spilt milk will not lick it up again. The cat would have crept out of the poke at some hole, before long.\" The meal was ready, but the mistress of the house declined to take her place at the head of her table. \" I am not fit company for the like of him. I would not know how to behave as I should, with a Prince seated at my right hand ; I've never yet gone into company I could not take the measure of, or where my manners were out of joint,\" for the mistress of Kingsbarrow was too proud to be vain. \" Woman, the Prince is as pleasant and simple as any lad in the country, forby he would not sit down without you,\" Kingsbarrow told her, and the matter was settled. The wanderer sat in his draggled uncomfortable dress between his hostess and Flora, with Kings barrow and Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, opposite. The Prince did justice to the supper, and declared he had never tasted one half so good before. He did not believe that when the ladies came to see him at St. James's, he would be able to furnish them with a petit souper which would equal theirs. Kingsbarrow fetched hot water from the kitchen, and Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, and Flora would have risen to bring the sugar-bowl and plate of lemons from the side-board, if the other gentleman in the company had not anticipated them by waiting on them and on himself. The India china punch-bowl, the tray with glasses, and the case bottles of whiskey, cognac, Hollands, and rum were already on the table."], [147, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 127 The Prince asked to be allowed to smoke his common clay pipe, which he had learnt to call his \"cutty\" and to use as a specific against his tooth ache. When he had done smoking he begged a pinch of snuff from Mrs. Macdonald, Kingsbarrow's, mull. Sensible as the little woman was, he was such good company, his frank condescension so overcame her that she would have pressed the mull and its wdiole contents upon him, if she had not been re strained by another consideration. The box would be a proud possession for the Kingsbarrow family in time to come. Then the more generous impulse again seized the mistress of Kingsbarrow. It caused her to present the box with solemn earnestness as a gift to her guest, and it induced him to accept it with corresponding grave graciousness. The box had its lesson, an ancestral lesson, for the Prince. It was a curious little old silver box having on it a carved design and an inscription. The design was two clasped hands. The inscription was \" For stark love and kindness.\" The legend which was attached to the box, connected it with an old Royal Stuart, James the Third, and his \"Me\" Robbie Gibb. Robbie, with the usual fule-wisdom, had taken note of the ambition and avarice of the courtiers round the king, and made the pertinent remark that while they served their master for places and lands, he and he alone served the king for stark love and kindness. In acknowledgment of this speech the goldsmith's art was applied to, and the box was framed, with the clasped hands \u2014 the king's and Robbie's \u2014 and the significant motto. Let Prince Charles and every prince after him, lay it to heart, that his best friends were those who, like King James's fule, and the house of Kingsbarrow, whatever they might receive from"], [148, "128 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" the free bounty of the royal favour, entered into no stipulation beforehand, and required no reward for their voluntary services. The short rest from toilsome exertion, the brief respite from bitter hardship, the comfortable room, the welcome heat from the peats which had been hastily kindled on the hearth, the abundant meal \u2014 primitive though it was, \" the wine of the country \" as he called the Mountain Dew, distilled without paying duty to King George, and the French brandy which, like the French claret, circulated freely in every better class Scotch house of the day, aU fired the young man's blood and raised his spirits to an extravagant pitch. He could not sing, make speeches, or give toasts, and call on his companions to do the same, because of the danger of arousing the household. But he told his best court and camp stories, and strove to prolong the entertainment, refusing to retire for the night, and insisting on the replenishing of the punch bowl once and again. In vain Kingsbarrow signed to the ladies to leave them, in vain he dwelt on the benefit of good seven hours' sleep in the first bed the tired man had slept in for many weeks. It was only the ladies who were carried away by Kingsbarrow's eloquence. The bare sound caused these reasonable women to lose their heads. What ! so highly born and so tenderly nurtured \u2014 the Prince of Wales, if his father had the rights he claimed, yet so worn and weary, without a roof to shelter him, or a bed to lie on ! But he should have the best of the beds in Kingsbarrow, if they could manage it, the women told themselves \u2014 women-like\u2014 and forthwith the finest of lily-white, lavender-scented sheets, the softest and warmest of English blankets, and a cun ningly quilted and embroidered silken coverlet were"], [149, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 129 spread on the down bed, within the four carved mahogany posts and the tartan cm-tains which graced the state-room at Kingsbarrow. When these willing ministrants to the fugitive's ease returned to the dining-room, they found him still in lively contention with his host. Fatigue was forgotten in the presence of that worst enemy to the royal lad, who was so loved and served \u2014 even by those who knew how desperate his cause was, who had foreseen the end from the beginning. What men put into their mouths to steal away their brains, was the deadliest foe Charles Stuart was destined to encounter, for it overthrew and degraded him as no human foe could have vanquished him. \"Your bedroom is waiting you, sir,\" said Mrs. Macdonald, Kingsbarrow, as she and the other ladies returned in a body from their self-imposed labours. But the imperious guest, his mutch flying off his head, his yellow locks streaming down under it, flushed, wild-eyed, a more randy-looking beggar-wife than ever, clamoured for a final doch an dorras. He seized hold of the punch-bowl which Kingsbarrow had caught up to put it beyond the Prince's reach, while he found himself compelled to say in so many words, as to a self-willed child, \" Na, your Royal Highness maun e'en go to bed, and get the sleep you stand sorely in need of. If you think me but a churlish carle for telling you so, it cannot be helped.\" In the struggle between the two men, the bowl feU to the floor broken in fragments. As Flora regarded them, she thought with a shiver they were an emblem of the shattered fortunes of the stranger in whose honour the bowl had been brought out. It had been a valued possession of the house, a bowl E"], [150, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 130 of real china, brought all the way from the Indies by a sea-faring friend of the family, but nobody uttered a lamentation, it might go with the rest ; and, after all, it was never more precious than when it had been clamped and riveted, and was preserved as a characteristic memento of the wayfarer who had tarried one wet summer night at Kingsbarrow. Silence and quiet reigned at last over the house hold where some slept the dead sleep of utter exhaustion, and others tossed restless in the grip of carking care and apprehensive responsibility. Flora Macdonald was one of the first to awake, quit the room which she had shared with Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost, and steal out, without awaking her bed-fellow, to see whom she could find to take counsel with on what should be done next. It was advisable that the Prince should leave as soon as possible, but how to hurry a man who was enjoying the first night's rest, after so long an interval? It felt inhuman, yet inhumanity \u2014 if that was inhumanity \u2014 must be the order of the day. Neither was the weather more cheering, unless in the sense that it would clear the moorland roads of all travellers who were not abroad from sheer necessity. But Flora was not able to take from the fact, this morning, the consolation it had imparted yesterday. She was made of flesh and blood, and therefore she was nearly worn out with fatigue \u2014 with nights spent in watching, and days passed in arduous journeys, while her task was not yet completed. It was not raining now, but the light of early morning had the watery paUor, struggling with the clouds of night which the rising sun had failed to disperse, that foreshadowed another day of dripping skies and spongy earth. It was the last"], [151, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 131 day of June, 1746, but for any clearness and bright ness of the work-a-day world, the snows of mid winter would have been preferable. Flora stood disconsolately in the grassy court, in front of the house, whose flanking stables, barns, and cowhouse enclosed the square. As she waited, a raven sailed between her and the horizon, uttering hoarse croaking cries which curdled her blood. Had it been a royal-eagle from the Cuchullins in pursuit of one of Kingsbarrow's lambs she would have minded it less. Then a couple of large stag-hounds, from the kennels, came bounding round the corner, frolicing and leaping on her. She knew them well enough, and had no fear of them, though she staggered under the force of their spring; but she was troubled to account for their being loose at this hour, and for the glee of the gambols which were calculated to attract attention, till the figure of a man appeared following at the heels of the dogs. It was one of those stately figures which the Highland dress set off to the greatest advantage \u2014 a fine young man, tall and broad-shouldered for his age, brown skinned and brown eyed, with a face which in repose was serene and sagacious like Kings barrow's, rather than keen and quick like that of Kingsbarrow's lady. The black hair was worn in a tie under a broad blue bonnet \" with a knot of black ribands like a cockade.\" The short coat was of brown cloth, the waistcoat of tartan with gilt buttons, the hose and the philabeg were also of tartan. The dress \u2014 that of an officer in a Highland regiment, was finished by the plaid over the shoulder. Flora had come out in search of a counsellor to brace up her courage, and help her with suitable"], [152, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 132 advice, but it was not this counsellor she had looked for, and she was vexed, she could hardly tell why, by his unexpected appearance. Her cheeks first reddened and then paled at the sight of him, while she strove to carry off her agitation by an easy bear ing. \"Where have you sprung from so early in the day, AUan Kingsbarrow?\" she tried to say lightly, advancing towards him with outstretched hand. \"Your father and mother did not expect you last night ; but, no doubt, the sight of you at breakfast will be a pleasant surprise for everybody.\" \" I am not so sure that my coming will be welcome,\" he said with moody vagueness ; and the face which at peace was tranquil in its steady good sense, had a look of sullen obduracy in its flush of resentment. He did not take the hand which she held out, a hand which dropped instantly by her side and was clenched tightly in the soreness of its rejection. \" I will not be asking your meaning for this be haviour, Allan Kingsbarrow,\" she said half indignantly, half disdainfully, \" very likely it will not pay the trouble of asking for it.\" \" And I will be bidding you step aside and speak a few words with me, since I've been so fortunate as to find you disengaged. (Down, Fin. Go away with you, Selma \" \u2014 to the two dogs rushing round him.) \" That is, if you have no objection,\" he ended stiffly. \"No objection in the world,\" she answered scorn fully, \"since the morning is so new begun that I cannot discern another person about who is better worth speaking to.\" She turned and walked a few paces back with him, out of sight of the windows. \" What person did you expect to meet?\" he"], [153, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 133 inquired angrily, blindly foUowing her lead. \" With whom were you intending to hold a rendezvous ? \" \" That is no business of yours, sir,\" she told him coolly. \" Because,\" he went on, goaded by her assumption of entire independence and indifference, \"I have always understood that it was not the way of princes to leave their soft beds and walk abroad betimes, when the fields and moors are heavy and sodden with wet, and that it is least of all the way of princes who sit long of a night over the bottle. I have heard, too, that there are words which are better said, and deeds which are better done by the light of the moon or the flare of a candle, than by any beams of the sun however wan and watery.\" \"You must be stark mad, Allan Kingsbarrow,\" said Flora, quivering with burning resentment and chill mortification which was like ice on the fire of her wrath; \"and it is not consistent with my self respect, or, for aught I ken, with my safety, to stand bandying words with a madman.\" And she made a motion to turn and leave him. But he barred her progress. \" We must have it out, Flora Milton,\" he cried desperately, \" or you'll drive me as mad as you say I am. I would never have thought it of you \u2014 you, that I held so good and wise and proud, as you were entitled to be, for there was not your marrow in the islands ! \" \" And what have I done to change your opinion ? \" she challenged him, furious with herself because her voice shook in its passion. \"I will tell you,\" he said, growing calmer, as she grew less mistress of herself and of the situation. He spoke with dogged determination, as if nothing would induce him to forego the purpose for which he"], [154, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 134 had come, as if the jealous rage and distrust, slow to be awakened in the man, would never be laid to rest. \" I came to Monkstadt last night; I had gotten leave because I was to be the bearer of a communication from Sir Alexander to Lady Marget. I was hard on your track, madam, though you did not know it, I had no thought in my mind save of learning whether you were at Milton or Armadale, and of taking a row or a ride for the chance of setting eyes on you. But Lady Marget told me everything.\" He broke off gloomily, staring at the ground, as if he no longer cared to look in her face. \" And what dreadful tale was there for Lady Marget to tell you?\" she defied him haughtily, holding up her head and addressing him with fresh nonchalance. \" She telled me that you had travelled night and day, in the teeth of the worst storm which had blown since the winter, you the only woman in the company of men, earring the Prince from Benbecula over to Skye, and that you were prepared to wait on him and attend on him, single handed, for as many more days and nights as it would take till he could ship for France.\" \" What then ? \" Flora asked sarcasticaUy. \" Would you not have done the same ? \" \" Me ! I'm different,\" he said, a little baffled and bewildered, in his slower wit, by the turn she had given to his charge. \" It is not only my coat, which you know is that of an officer of King George's, and I have not cast it off as young Clanranald did his.\" \" Very well, then,\" she said, taking the word out of his mouth, and preventing him from finishing his speech, \"act up to your coat, as Allan of Knock is acting up to his, go in and serve King George.

The very enormity of the accusation deprived it of the power to outrage him. \"You'll be saying as many ill words as you please, but you do not believe what you say,\" he replied, more quietly than he had yet spoken. \" You are as sensible as I am that I would not hurt a hair of Prince Charles's ill-fated head.\" \"Then what ails you at me?\" she protested pettishly. \" I teUed you there was an odds,\" he insisted. \" I am a man and you are a woman \u2014 not to say young and bonnie,\" he added, a little as if the words were extorted from him. \" I have not fought under him, I am with Sir Alexander and President Forbes and the Government as it stands, and so were you the last time we had speech together.

But he faced round upon her with bent brow, and the brown eyes underneath kindling with the fierce yellow light which sometimes lurks in the liquid brown of such eyes, as it is seen in the eyes of birds of prey. \" I have telled you what I might have done,"], [156, "136 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" might do yet if called upon.

He looked long after her, then called his dogs, and went back as he had come. He had always been on the best terms with his father and mother, who valued him highly, and he was fond of little Nanny. On any other occasion, the eldest son and brother's arrival would have been hailed with acclamation by high and low. But now Kingsbarrow was no place for him, King George's loyal soldier, Flora Milton's dis carded lover, with the rebel Prince, the bone of con tention between him and Flora, under its roof, after Flora Milton had set him at naught, would have none of his remonstrance, and in the harshest most arrogant spirit, had broken her troth to him."], [158, "138 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" CHAPTER XL 44 Farewell, my young hero, the gallant, the young ; The crown of thy fathers is torn from thy brow.\" James Hogg. Instead of taking an early departure as had been proposed, the Prince slept on till two o'clock in the afternoon. It was difficult for anybody to find it in his or her heart to disturb him. Mrs. Macdonald, Kingsbarrow, who was on tenterhooks, was restrained by her husband. He was persuaded, on second thoughts, that a later start was less open to suspicion that one at break of day, and it would give Captain Donald Roy more time for his negotiations with young Raasay. As for the servants, and their com ments on the extraordinary liberty taken by Miss Macdonald's Lish \" tawpie \" of a servant in lying so long abed after her mistress was abroad, that must take its chance. As it was, men and women were commenting already on the singular circumstance that the maid had been put in the best bed, while the mistress had only occupied the second best. This was the consequence of the weakness of the ladies, in cluding the mistress of the house, so that she was no longer in a position to condemn the shortsightedness of her companions. The comfort was that rumours of all kinds were rife in the country, and these remarks might pass among the rest, without attract ing particular attention. Flora's steel-blue eyes were brighter than ever, above the spot of vivid red burning on each cheek, while she talked and laughed and would not confess to more than a mere agreeable shadow of fatigue which would pass away the moment she took the"], [159, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 139 road again. It would not interfere in the least with the eight miles which lay between Kingsbarrow and Portree ; she could not trust the Prince whom the Clanranalds had committed to her care \u2014 not even to Kingsbarrow \u2014 she must see to him herself as she had brought him to Skye which had turned out to be a nest of hornets ; she must take care that he got off the island again without further loss. \" I have got into the way of such travelling,\" she said. \" I'm a good walker, I would not be worthy the name of a Highland woman if I were not. I'll not miss the pony which I am going to leave behind me, because it is better that we should alter our order of march. The weather ? Am I not used to Skye and Long Island weather ? The distance ? I would not mind though it were thirty or forty instead of seven miles, if it had not been for his Royal Highness's blistered feet and bachled shoon. But he is to have Kingsbarrow's new pair, which will be a fine exchange. Yes, I believe I could do the forty miles in the mind I'm in this morning, so that you need not pity me whatever, Mrs. Macdonald, Kirkiebost.\" Flora was still to be the Prince's henchwoman. No other was so quick-witted, none could so well carry out the man\u0153uvres which had been roughly sketched out at Ormiclade, more fully planned at Monkstadt, and finally matured, so far as the present group of his Royal Highness's friends were concerned, at Kingsbarrow. Flora and Niel MacEachan were to be the fugitive's guides to Portree \u2014 the little town which formed the capital of Skye.

There, do you hear her crying for her \"brat,\" she but to have her brat \u2014 her apron, though if you do not look after her, mother, she is as like as not to tie it on inside out, or back side fore.\" Mrs. Macdonald felt it was time for her to inter pose, and seek to moderate the unfortunate young gentleman's volatile spirits. She called on Flora to bear her company, and with some ceremony craved leave to enter her own best bedroom. But no sooner was she in the presence of her guest, than all the woman in her responded afresh to the romance and the pity of the situation. She was ready to pay the randy woman \u2014 still shaking with laughter at his own reflection, in such a mirror as he had not looked into since he came to Syke \u2014 homage equal to what she would have paid him if he had stood in a court suit, with a star on his breast, in a presence chamber. No such glamour had beset Mrs. Macdonald, Kingsbarrow, since her love and Kingsbarrow's was in its first tender youth. \"Flora,\" she whispered, \"could you beg a lock of his yellow hair \u2014 do you think? Just to keep in remembrance that we once harboured a prince at Kingsbarrow? \" \" Oh yes, I'll ask it for you, Mrs. Macdonald, if you like,\" said Flora, after an instant's startled pause. \"Will your Royal Highness think us too bold for"], [161, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 141 making a petition ? Can you spare a wee bit of your hair for Mrs. Macdonald here, to retain as a memento of your visit ? She will be proud to wear it in a brooch or a ring, openly, some day, if \u2014 when \u2014 should you ever come back to reign over us.\" It was one of the few allusions Flora made, in return for the many hare-brained predictions on the Prince's part, to the possibility of the ultimate triumph of the Jacobite cause. She blushed as she spoke, and the sentence seemed to stick in her throat as she uttered it, without faith in its fulfilment, or wish for it. \" With all my heart,\" he cried with great alacrity ; and without stopping to weigh her embarrassed tone, he flung himself on his knees, snatched off his mutch and commanded the ladies to clip away. \" You're welcome to the whole crop.\" Flora directed him to lay his head \u2014 not in her lap, as he proposed, but on the seat of the chair nearest him, and it was with Mrs. Macdonald's scissors, which the excellent housewife wore hanging along with her Uttle round pin-cushion, by the side of her dress, that the lock was cut. It was only a little lock, and Flora gave it at once to Mrs. Macdonald. It was by that lady's desire the lock was halved, with the assertion \"You are better entitled to it than I, Flora Milton.\" The glamour was still at work when the mistress of Kingsbarrow took Flora aside, and made another proposal. It was a proposal which did not sound so strange in the ears of Highlanders of that generation, as it would have sounded to Saxons of a later day. The suggestion was in reference to the \" dead fine \" linen sheets, spun, bleached, and woven under the house-mistress's personal superintendence, which the ladies in their kindness had spread the"], [162, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 142 previous night, on the best bed in Kingsbarrow, for the most \" ill-fa'ured,\" weather-beaten, dilapidated tenant it was ever Ukely to contain. Should these sheets be cut in two, the one half to be kept by Mrs. Macdonald, Kingsbarrow, the other to be given as a gift of distinction to Flora Milton, and both halves to be retained and converted into shrouds for then respective possessors, when their caU came ? \" You ken, Flora, it is only wiselike to have every thing in readiness, since we know not what a day or an hour may bring forth,\" Mrs. Macdonald impressed on her young friend. \"I see not what purpose I could put the sheets to, otherwise. I could not let a meaner man sleep in them, could I, Fhionghail, after they had wrapped the limbs of a prince ? \" Flora regarded the strange present thoughtfully. \" Yes,\" she said, \" I will take it, and many thanks to you, ma'am. I've done more for him, poor foreign laddie, than I'm like to do for any other mortal man. It is not probable that I'll ever be permitted to save another man's life \u2014 if so be I've saved his, and it may be the deed has cost me dear, far more than any other act in all my days. I'll have good care of the sheet, and there's neither friend nor foe dare say there will be an unfitness in my body being rowed in it, when it is Ufted into my coffin. Eh, but I know a girl \u2014 and that is none other than my cousin Lorraine at Kilmossie who, if she heard word, would be fit to steal my braw shroud from me, she would be fain to dee if she thought I would ware it on her for a last compliment.\" Before host and guest parted, Kingsbarrow bestowed on the Prince the factor's new shoes, which Charles Stuart accepted with his usual grace and his usual speech \u2014 in which there was no insincerity, only a"], [163, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 143 proud confidence which had a piteous ring in it, that Kingsbarrow should wear the cast \" bachles \" when he came to St. James's, and that the Prince would like to see the lord-in-waiting who would venture to refuse admittance to the Highland gentleman when he came with that reminder on his feet. It was a judicious precaution, probably due to the subtle brain of Niel MacEachan, rather than to a skill in evasion evolved by the rest of the company, that the Prince should not wear the same disguise for any length of time, but that he should vary it on every opportunity. Accordingly, he was only to masquerade as Flora's maid till he had left Kings barrow and its occupants fairly behind him. Niel carried a bundle which held the suit of one of the poorer Highland taeksmen or gamekeepers, bonnet, plaid, short coat, phiUabeg, and hose. At the first bend in the road, Flora pushed on in advance, while the two men stayed behind tiU \"Betty Burke \" could accompUsh another metamorphosis. In spite of the fun the poor young fellow had made of his woman's garments, he was only too thankful to be rid of them, and to get back to male attire. The Prince looked smarter than Flora had yet seen him when he rejoined her, but as he was thinking complacently that she was furtively remarking and admiring the improvement in his appearance, it so happened that she was simply recognizing with a curious thrill and pang, that the old coat he wore, had once belonged to AUan Kingsbarrow. It had been made for a much bigger man than the Prince, and though his height was equal to that of the original wearer, the coat hung loosely on the narrower, sparer shoulders. The sight of it caused Flora to sink into a troubled silence, leaving her companions to pursue"], [164, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 144 their conversation in French, without any inter rupting question from her. The relentless rain which had marked the whole expedition, descended as before, in long slanting lines. These changed in colour from misty blue to muddy brown, as the texture of the mantle of cloud hiding the unseen sun, was thinner or thicker, assuming now and then a deceptive gauziness, as if the veil were about to be rent asunder, but presently closing in and condensing again into an opaque barrier which looked as solid as the heathery landscape over which it brooded. The day might have been one in a dreary October, when the potato leaves were black and rotting in the wet, instead of the last of June, when such fields as the travellers occasionally came upon, in the cultivated tracts of land, were only un folding shoots of the freshest green. At times when a high road and a low, leading to the same goal, offered themselves, Flora, always, with the view of destroying the scent, and of confusing and distracting any follower on their footsteps, separated from the two others, and went on alone, till the paths met again. In the course of the afternoon, she was overtaken by three gillies, with a peat cart and a couple of ponies, travelling in the same direction. She availed herself of the proposal, made with High land politeness, that the lady who had to be abroad and was proceeding to her destination on foot, on such a dripping day, might make use of one of the ponies. She rode, identifying herself with this other group, till the higher road was about to merge into the lower, when looking down she could discover the bent heads of the Prince and MacEachan, with the water streaming from their broad bonnets, appearing above the rising ground. Then she announced that"], [165, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 145 these strangers were friends of hers, for whom she must wait, in order to join them, and, alighting, dis missed her companions. Notwithstanding her boasting in the morning of the forty miles she could travel on foot without giving way, the long strain of fatigue and exposure, with feelings wrought up to the highest pitch, was be ginning to tell severely upon her. The last of the eight miles was the straw which threatened to break the weary camel's back. StiU it was not so much down right exhaustion, as a keen desire to baffle pursuers which induced her to shift her path and alter her mode of travelling. Flora was devoutly thankful, and yet she grew nervous at sight of the thatched cottages of Portree, just as the dismal afternoon was passing into evening. The town was then little better than a large hamlet on the coast, though it was the capital of Skye, the scene of an annual cattle-fair known through all the West Highlands, and already a place of considerable trade of its kind. It was frequented freely by captains of smacks and sloops, cattle drovers, packmen, etc. The project had been that the Prince, on his arrival, should have recourse to one of the innumerable sandy holes, like rabbit holes, along the shore ; but his night in civilized quarters had spoilt him. He flatly refused to steal away to the lair, and elected to go to the only inn or change-house, where there was generally a variety of company coming and going. He vowed that if the rest of the house was full, the kitchen would be a palace-chamber in contrast with the hole on the shore. There was small blame to the lad, since he and the whole party were drenched to the skin, and his starved stomach craved more solid and comforting nutriment than the slices of bread and L"], [166, "146 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" cheese, cured tongue and kipper, which had been part of Niel's burden. Flora and Niel suffered themselves to be persuaded into the rashness of taking shelter in the inn, under the eye of the skippers, cattle-dealers and drovers, chiefly on account of the compensation for the risk afforded by the probabdity of their more readUy finding Raasay or some messenger from him, deputed to await the travellers. So it happened. Young Raasay, who had stayed \" in \" with King George and the Government, when his father and the clan went after King James, and young Raasay's brother, Murdoch, the doctor, and his cousin Malcolm, two of the clan who had been out with old Raasay, were at the inn, in possession of its only private room, and on the watch for the arrival of the illustrious guest who was to be entrusted to their keeping. They had already circulated a story of a new tacksman coming to one of the laird's farms for whom the three men were waiting, in order to take him over to the Island of Raasay. Flora, as a matter of course, was well acquainted with all the three Macleods, who fraternized so cheer fully and conveniently, whether they belonged to the \"in\" or the \"out\" faction. They were of the Scandinavian type of islanders with curly yellow hah, fair fresh complexions and stalwart limbs. She had met them at many a merry gathering, in many a brilliant reel she had been their partner ; but she had not anticipated taking sides with them in so serious and momentous a business as that in hand. They on their part were prepared to welcome Flora Milton as a comrade and counsellor, even more in valuable than the cosmopolitan MacEachan of whom they entertained the Country's usual doubt and"], [167, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 147 distrust. They looked to her for that particular intro duction to the Prince, of whom young Raasay especi ally was a trifle shy. They asked her opinion whether it was advisable that the boat which was to convey them and their passengers to Raasay should be hauled cautiously out of sight, or whether it should be left unconcernedly, as it were, rocking at the end of the little pier, which belonged to the inn. They pressed her urgently to accompany them to Raasay, declaring in all sincerity that they would have more faith in the success of the adventure, if she were in the boat. But Flora, looking in their eager, resolute faces, did not doubt their capacity for the undertaking. She laughed and inquired if they would have her play the prophetess Deborah to their Captain Barak ? She reminded them that her association with the Prince had lasted long enough, that its farther con tinuance would only add to his danger, because her presence would help his enemies to trace him. In the meantime, the Prince was regaling himself sumptuously on a steaming dish of collops, and a tumbler of hot toddy. He was calling lustily on his companions to join him at the feast, as if nothing else were worth attending to. Why would they stand aside and whisper together ? Good meat and drink had not been so plentiful of late that it should be allowed to grow cold, for idle scruples of ceremony and intrusion on his privacy, or for cares which might be put aside till a more convenient season. \" But arrangements must be made for your Royal Highness's immediate departure,\" objected young Raasay, very solemn under the sense of onerous duty imposed upon him, his brother and his cousin Mal colm, without even Flora Milton with her wit and her"], [168, "148 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" sense being at liberty to pilot them through their difficulties. \"A fig for your arrangements. Depart! No, gentlemen, I do not mean to depart to-night.\" The Prince took away their breaths by announcing authoritatively, \"I know a decent bed and a warm night-cap too well, when I've the luck to find them, to throw them up for idle scares and false alarms. We'll make a night of it, gentlemen, and Miss Macdonald will honour us with her company, as long as she feels inclined. It will be time enough to talk of departing to-morrow morning, when this cursed rain may have ceased.\" And he glanced down ruefully at Kingsbarrow's new shoes, which were one mass of mud, that he was transferring to the deal floor. The Macleods were dumb in their dismay. Niel MacEachan appealed as vehemently as a look could appeal, to Flora. Instantly she came forward to the table, and looked the young man lounging there full in the face, with her honest, earnest blue eyes, in a look that had more in it of wondering reproach than of humble entreaty. \" Sir,\" she said, \" once before, as you may mind, you would have imperilled yourself and your cause, and the friends who were doing their best, and risking their all, to aid you, if I had not hindered you. It was for a sentiment that time, a sentiment of friend ship. Would you do it again for no sentiment of love or friendship, but just for a little bodily ease, so that if I do not hinder you the second time, it will be still less for your honour, than if you had got your will at the first. Was that the way of it with your Polish great grandfather, the hero no less than the King, John Sobieski ? Was that the way of it with your far"], [169, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 149 away ancestor, Robert the Bruce, who fought seven battles to win his crown, and was hunted with beagles and hard beset by Macdougal of Lorn among these very islands of ours ? \" \" No, by Heavens ! \" The Prince sprang to his feet in an ebullition of mingled discomfiture and shame. \"Eh, Men I you are a hard task-mistress, my fair lady. I wonder what some people I know would say, if they heard you thus finding fault with your prince, and hounding him on to fresh toil and suffering.\" \" Hard or soft, the words are spoken for your Royal Highness's sake. You are wise enough to know that,\" said Flora quietly ; \"as for the people who would not confer you for your good, I rede you beware of them.\" The Prince's tift of temper had entirely evaporated by the time the party \u2014 unnoticed and unaccompanied in the wet and gloom \u2014 had reached the end of the pier. All his better self was uppermost, and the tears were standing in those flower-blue eyes of his, when he took Flora's two hands in his, with unaffected gratitude, and bent over her. \" Words will not serve to thank you, my deliverer, my best friend,\" he said fervently, \"and when words fail what is there left save the true and undying homage of the heart, which is beyond words ? Fare weU, Flora Macdonald, till better days come round. TeU my good friends Clanranald and Kingsbarrow it is my special charge to them that they look after you, and see you suffer no evil consequences at the hands of tyrants and usurpers, for what you have done for your Prince.\" He stooped down and kissed her, with respect which was near to reverence, on the forehead, and stepped into the boat into which young Raasay"], [170, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 150 had preceded him, and was hoisting the sail, while Murdoch and Malcolm Macleod sprang after him. Flora watched the boat as long as there was a glimpse of Ught by which to see the rocking speck on the water. She sent back Niel MacEachan to bid the landlady make ready a bed for Miss Macdonald from the Long Island. He was also to ascertain what was the talk in the bar, in order to smooth it down, as he knew how, with his knowledge of the world and his plausible speech and bearing. He was to get rid of any incongruity about the party, of any contradiction in the story set afloat by the Macleods, who had hung about half the day at Portree, in short, of anything amiss which might strike the more in telligent of the observers, in times which were troubled enough to sharpen tbe dullest wits, and incline them to look out for marvels. Tired out and soaked with rain, Flora lingered and gazed wistfully at the vanishing speck on the darken ing sea. Her task was ended, her pledge fulfiUed and still she was loth to go. \"We'll never meet again,\" she said to herself, \" my Prince as you thought and caUed yourself, though to me you were Uttle else than a hapless young man for whom my poor old friends Clanranald and his lady were like to be sacrificed, and driven out of house and hold, as it was with the head and tail of the family of Glengarry and with all that was left of stout Keppoch. And Allan Kingsbarrow was insolent and brutal, and we, too, have parted never to be the same to each other again. Poor me ! Poor Allan ! Poor Prince ! Supposing it had been ordained he should be king, it might not have fared that ill with him, if he had had Kingsbarrow to stand by him, and keep him from the drink, and if I had"], [171, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 151 been there to hold him back from the love of women, or to learn him to care for them as a brother cares for his sisters ! \" CHAPTER XII. 11 For here nae langer maun I stay.\" Old Song. The deluge of rain which was the accompaniment of the Prince's visit to Skye, had spent itself. The heavens were clear, the earth was dry, the sun was making up for lost time, by pouring down its un clouded rays, day after day. The Hebrides were in their brief summer glory \u2014 the unapproachable glory of air as light and fresh, touched with as inspiring a crispness as might have been the air of Eden. The hues of the conglomeration of rock, moor, moss, and encircling ocean were as wonderful in their purples, lilacs, and blues, their orange and rose at sunset, their silver and pearl at sunrise, as mortal eye had ever beheld them. The green corn \u2014 greener there than elsewhere \u2014 was shooting into ear. The potato fields were starred with their white and lilac blossoms. The brave Skye \" birk \" trees which bent their white stems and slender boughs low before the fierce winter storms that swept the island, and strewed the shores with torn sea-weed and fragments of wreckage, rose unharmed \u2014 now that the blast had died away, and shook out their fragrant tresses to the summer breeze. The bell-heather in its soft ruddy purple carpeted thickly all the lower uplands, leaving the bare peaks and misty crags which towered on high in naked majesty, to crown the landscape with solemn grandeur. The very beasts and birds responded to the era of"], [172, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 152 brilliant light and tempered heat. The deer trotted lightly down to the shore to drink from the salt water pools. The goats and rabbits scrambled and scampered boldly into sight, shaking their grey beards and flashing the white tufts of their taUs, in defiance of dogs and guns. The rocks by the water's edge were alive with gulls, sea-mews, sea-pyots, sea-fowl of every description, swooping and whirling and screaming, as they fed their young in the crannies. Solan geese saUed clumsily, flapping their wings as with the sound of distant thunder, while they crossed in flocks the blue vault overheard. Royal eagles, in solitary state, soared as high as the dusky recesses of the farthest Cuchullins, the duskiness relieved against the lessening streaks and patches of wintry snow. It was well for the islanders when the king of birds gripped no prey in his relentless talons \u2014 no broken necked cock once the pride of the barn yard, no doubled-up kid or lamb with starting eyes and gasping throat. Nay, greater calamities had come to pass, where a young mother had carried out her baby in its cradle, and deposited it trustfully in a secluded nook of the hay-field, or down in the shade of the alder bushes by the bickering burn in which she washed her clothes. Then the wailing infant was snatched from its resting-place and borne off by the dauntless marauder. Never more would the hapless mother sing at her spinning-wheel, or have her fortune told by the lore of the stars, which many a withered old cailag or moome reverenced, well-nigh worshipped, in spite of her allegiance to her kirk and minister. It was the time when the sheep were washed, and the lambs were \" speaned,\" when the droves of cattle \u2014 even those which included the youngest calves,"], [173, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 153 were driven to the highest pastures \u2014 a time of butter churning, ewe-milk cheese-making, egg-gathering and storing for the winter, a time of cloth \" wauking,\" of blanket-washing, and webs of linen-bleaching, a happy and a busy time, only to be surpassed by the joyous stir and heat of harvest, the importance of the potato-digging, the excitement of the return of the boats from the herring-fishing, the abandonment to feasting and making merry when the marts were killed in honour of the work of summer and autumn having been successfully accomplished, and men gave thanks and sought to make their hearts glad, as a charm against the gloom and privation of the short days and dark nights of the long winter. It was the season, above all others, when those natives of the western islands who loved them whole heartedly and disinterestedly, desired to be at home to play their part in the general blythe bustle, to see the country at its best, to luxuriate in its charm, to boast of it to aU unfortunate outsiders who came to spy the land. Flora was back in South Uist, making the most of these halcyon days, trying to forget that there was any shadow over their sunshine, any heart-sorrow of her own which lay heavy in her breast, and haunted her wherever she went. She had paid a flying visit to her mother and been scolded and applauded for her heroic deed. She had returned swiftly to Benbe cula and Ormiclade to tell her adventures in detail, and be made much of by the grateful Clanranalds whose role she had played, whom she had redeemed from their sore strait by being herself their ransom, she had been to Milton to appease her brother Angus by showing him she had got off scot free from the consequences of her escapade."], [174, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 154 Flora knew the whole story had leaked out. The Benbecula boatmen, as Mrs. Macdonald, Kingsbarrow, had foreseen, had not kept silence with regard to the strange passenger in Flora MUton's train, whom they had rowed over to Skye. Within a week of the event, Captain Fergusson and a detachment of men from his cutter, craved the hospitality of Lady Marget. Lady Marget had known how to receive them with the most unapproachable Eglintoun dignity, but she had not been able to deny that her young friend, Miss Macdonald, with her servant and her escort \u2014 the traveller, Niel MacEachan, had passed a night at Monkstadt in the course of the previous week. The talk about the uncouth Irish spinning-maid was still current in the kitchen, and was swiftly snatched up by Fergusson. He followed in her track and in that of her mistress and the factor, to Kingsbarrow. There the inquisitor was met by fresh evidence in the mysterious report of the servant who had received the best bedroom in Kingsbarrow for the night's accommodation, wlnle her mistress and Mrs. Mac donald, Kirkiebost, were satisfied to share the second best. But what did the discovery signify ? The bird was flown, the Prince was safely out of that corner of Skye. For, in eluding the vigilance which would soon have ransacked the little island of Raasay from end to end, he was back like a will o' the wisp, in a totally different quarter of the larger island and that too was a mere feint to enable him to take boat unobserved for the mainland, where he would have done well to have tarried from the beginning, in accordance with the advice of his followers. The Prince was out of the trap which the war vessels stationed round the islands had set for him. He was"], [175, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 155 still roaming at large, till his friends at home and abroad could compass his deliverance \u2014 that at least could be said, and Flora's mind was so far at rest about him. With regard to herself, her conscience was clear though her heart was sore, she was not even greatly alarmed when, during her stay at Milton, she received a summons to repair to Skye and appear before a magistrate, another captain of militia \u2014 Macleod of Talisker \u2014 to answer for her conduct in aiding and abetting the young Pretender to escape from justice. MUton might fume and growl ; Flora said always she had done no wrong, she was willing to go before Talisker who happened to be an acquaintance of the family at Armadale, or before any other authority to give a reason for her conduct. Angus need not vex himself over the affront of having to attend her on such an errand. She wanted nobody's company ; she would not compromise any one. She did not trouble the Clanranalds by telling them where or for what purpose she was going expressly, when she sailed again for Skye, on a cloudless summer morning on this occasion. She encountered no obstacle, and the afternoon was still early when she walked in alone at the front door of the house of Talisker, and, meeting its master in the entrance, said calmly \u2014 \u2022 \" Here I am, Talisker, at your pleasure ; what is your will with me ? \" Poor Talisker who was old enough to have been her father, and shy in his reluctance to perform the hard duty imposed upon him, could only shake his own head in addition to her hand, and say \u2014 \"What is this you have been about Flora Milton? I thought you could be trusted to keep out of mis chief.\""], [176, "156 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" \" I have only been doing what you yourself would have done in my place,\" Flora assured him confi dently. \" I've but been helping an unfortunate man \u2014 a prescribed prince (what the better or the worse is he for his rank ?) \u2014 to save his head, till he has time to grow sadder and wiser. What hving creature, with a heart in his or her breast, could have acted other wise ? \" Talisker could only shake his head anew and and scratch it in his perplexity, at this question, and at her straightforward and undaunted answers to his cross-examination. \" Yes, it is as you say, sir. I crossed from Ben becula with Prince Charles ; but Lady Marget knew nothing of our coming \u2014 do not imphcate Lady Marget.\" \"Yes, I travelled with his Royal Highness, Mr. Alexander Macdonald, Kingsbarrow, and a few others in our company, on the following day, a Sabbath day, as far as Kingsbarrow, and stopped the night there.\" \" Yes, I went with the Prince and Niel MacEachan to Portree, and parted from Prince Charles there.\" \" No, I have not seen him since, and I cannot say, beyond the country clashes, what has become of him.\" This was the sum of the statement. What could canny Talisker do after he had written down a solemn report but tell the undaunted culprit. \" Well, Miss Macdonald, I hope from the bottom of my heart no harm will come from this action on your part. Between you and me, my dear (Talisker was greyheaded), I cannot for the life of me pretend that you committed any great offence, or that you are aught save the brave, honest lass I've always known you."], [177, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 157 But there, we'll say no more, since the least said is sunest mended. If you will not stay to taste what my housekeeper can find for you (Talisker was a bachelor) I would advise you to go over at once to your mother at Armadale. She'll be fond to have you with her for a day or two, and I'll know where to get you if you're wanted \u2014 not that I count upon it. It is fine weather now, and the light is long at this time of the year, you have a pleasant walk before you. My best respects to the mother and to Captain Hugh.\" The weather might be fine and the light long, but Flora did not reach Armadale that night. The rich soft hues of the dying day fell on a strange episode in her \"pleasant walk,\" by the shore. She had not been greatly surprised to find a party of soldiers picqueting among the rough sea-grass and the boulders ; but she was taken aback when several men detached themselves from the main body, advanced quickly towards her, and, coming behind and before her, enclosed her on all sides. She knew Captain Fergusson of the cutter Fury sufficiently by sight to recognize that he was the leader of the party. She had heard of him as an active, intelligent officer, and keen Whig and Hanoverian, who, more than any other of his contemporaries, unless it were Captain John Macleod of Balmeonach with his militia, had rendered himself and his cutter conspicuous in the pursuit of the Prince, and had exposed himself to the odious suspicion of seeking to gain the price set on the head of the last of the Stuarts who had cast him seU on the loyalty of his countrymen. Stopping short of this baseness, Fergusson was apt to forget everything in the zeal of the chase. His hard, alert face and harsh set voice held in them only a scant allowance of the forbearance due to a woman, and the"], [178, "158 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" courtesy generally accorded to a gentlewoman, when he stopped Flora with the words \u2014 \"You are my prisoner, Miss Macdonald ; I have a warrant to arrest you and take you on board my cutter.\" His brusqueness was of service to Flora. Her spirit and self-respect were up in arms instantly. Her pride would not suffer her to let the rude aggressor see that she shrank from the consequences of her deed, that she feared either him and his men, or the gathering night and the darkening waves to be faced in such company. His tone enabled her to recover, without the loss of a moment, from the shock of the rude interruption and impediment on the familiar road she had been accustomed to tread without challenge or molestation. \"Sir,\" she said to him with the simple dignity natural to her, \" it appears to me you have chosen an unfitting hour and place for the execution of your commission \u2014 if you hold such a commission. You had only to come up in the morning to my step father's house of Armadale, and you would not have found the doors barred against you. There was no occasion for you to way-lay me on the King's high way, when I was hastening home in fear of being benighted. But it is no matter ; show me your credentials\u2014 no, I do not mean that, you may not have them upon your person, it is unreasonable to expect it. I know you, both by sight and reputa tion \u2014 you are an officer and a gentleman, therefore I will trust your word, and give you no trouble. I will go with you and your men, at once, on board your cutter, which I can just discern lying off the point yonder. I could have wished that you had granted me time to intimate your intention to my mother,"], [179, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 159 if so be you have not advised her of it yourself; but she has not been apprised of my coming, so that it signifies less. To-morrow will do to communicate with her.\" \" That remains to be seen, madam,\" said Fergusson, guardedly. \"You may think that I have no choice save to accompany you at the first word,\" said Flora, indignantly; \"but you would surely prefer that I went willingly, and did not compel you to take me by force, would you not ? \" Fergusson had the grace to look a Uttle put out and to mutter,\" I am obliged to you, of course, Miss Macdonald, for your complacency; \" but he spoilt the concession by adding sarcastically, \"You are wise to offer no resistance.\" Indeed, how could she if she possessed a particle of common-sense and foresight ? It was practically useless for her to attempt a struggle, on the lone shore road, with the half-dozen men who had not been counted too many for the purpose of over powering her ; and what could be weaker or more humilating than for her to enter on so unequal a contest ? If Fergusson's men had offered to handcuff Flora, she would have held out her slim wrists for the irons ; but she had only to walk in the centre of the group of cutter's men down through the shingle to the edge of the water. Captain Fergusson walked next her, but he did not volunteer to smooth the roughness of the descent, as the Prince had volunteered, on a very different night on the opposite side of the Minch. The officer blew a whistle which brought a boat, hidden in a creek, promptly splashing through the water. It had but now blushed under the ruddy"], [180, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 160 blaze of the sunset which was fast growing grey in the soberness of the gloaming, that, happfly for Flora, was the clear, cool light, neither bright nor obscure, of the protracted twilight of the north. Flora was handed ceremoniously into the cutter's boat, seated in the stern, and rowed rapidly away from the land of Skye, she knew not where or for how long. It was like another vision of the night, not so terrible as the one she had experienced before, but paralyzing and chilling after its kind, though the Minch was rocking the boat gently, as if it had been a cradle, and in the pale lilac of the western sky the evening star was hanging, whUe in the deeper blue the moon, in her first quarter, was glittering like a curved sabre, relieved against the summer dusk. In spite of the season, the wind off the water blew damp and dank. Flora's ordinary travelling habit was not thick enough to defy it ; but she would fain not shiver lest the source of the action should be mistaken. She thought she had controlled her inclination successfully, tiU Captain Furgusson, as if by an irresistible impulse, pulled off his jacket, and sought to screen her from the evening breeze. He would have turned away to escape from her thanks ; and when she would make him hear that she was beholden to him, but that she would not have him suffer inconvenience on her account, he looked her in the face, and answered her, with a sternness which masked every other emotion, \" Madam, a brave man must always respect a brave woman.\" In the cabin of the cutter, Flora was brought before a stranger in authority, General Campbell. His being totally unknown to her, his general's uniform, his military bearing, and a scar over his left eye where part of his eyebrow had been carried"], [181, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 161 off by a musket-ball, were all sufficiently formidable ; but the formidableness was qualified partly by the easy good breeding of a man of the world under any circumstances, partly by the good-humoured twinkle of the eyes open to the absurdity of the situation. Soldiers and sailors did not go into the field to fight with women \u2014 whether old or young \u2014 like the gentlewoman thus thrown upon his hands. What was he to do with her? What could King George himself make of her? Not cut off the pretty erect head with its wind-dishevelled curls? Not ship her to the Barbadoes to work on a plantation. Pooh ! pooh ! neither alternative was to be thought of for a moment. She was not even one of a rebel papist stock, her friends were as good Whigs and Presbyterians as any Campbell among them. Should the government lock her up for the rest of her days ? Why, that would only be to have her prison doors besieged by a host of gallant champions whom her undeserved misfortunes would raise up for her deliverance, when they would make her story an excuse for any number of mad demonstrations. All through Flora Macdonald' s term of imprison ment the same sense of almost laughable incongruity and tantalizing perplexity haunted and harassed her gaolers. As for General Campbell he treated his captive with the greatest kindness and indulgence, as became a stout soldier and a polite gentleman. \" My dear young lady,\" he addressed her with great urbanity when he had heard her story, \"you have been over-persuaded by foolish friends who have got you into a sorry scrape, but you may rely upon it I will do the best I can for you. I shall ask Captain Fergusson to put his cabin at your disposal. Certainly you will 31"], [182, "162 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" be allowed to land to-morrow morning, and go to Armadale to bid good-bye to your mother and get a female servant and what necessaries you require. I am afraid I shall have to send you on to Edinburgh, there to await further instructions. But, in the mean time, make yourself as comfortable as you can.\" Flora heard another version of what was likely to become of her, when she was permitted next morning to go ashore under a guard, and repair to Armadale the goal of her last night's interrupted walk. Armadale was in what was called the garden of Skye, the most low-lying, sheltered, fertile portion of the island. To Flora it was always like a return to the lowlands to see her step-father's thriving fields and her mother's terraced flower-beds. The house was not the old castle of Sir Donald Macdonald which had been destroyed by fire. It was only a better sort of farm-house, though on account of its being occupied by Sir Alexander, when he visited the southern portion of his estates, and of the dignity of its grey stone roof, it was sometimes called a castle to this day. In the month of July there was an abundance of lowland roses, carnations, and gilli flowers, scenting the ah \u2014 fresh in its softness. The mountains of Moidart and Knoidart rose from the mainland opposite Armadale, while the Sound of Sleat, the usual water-boundary which was here narrowed and land-locked, sparkled and rippled under the sunshine and the fitful summer wind, like a happy innocent child tickled into laughter. Flora's errand had preceded her, and she was met by her mother on the threshold, which Mrs. Mac donald Armadale rarely crossed, with piteous waitings and tender but not the less heart-rending reproaches. \" Oh, Flora, what is this that you have gone and"], [183, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 163 done ? What misery is this that you have brought on yourself and me ? \" Marian Macdonald had been a pretty fragile girl, a pretty delicate wife and mother. She had been cared for and petted aU her life. Her father, the \"strong minister,\" had petted her, her two husbands in suc cession had petted her. From Flora's earliest years, when she was with her mother, the usual relations had been reversed, the daughter had been more accustomed to care for her mother, than to be cared for by her. Looking at Mrs. Macdonald, still pretty, still slight, stiU youthful in appearance, still clinging and dependent, in her black mode gown, and cambric friUs, her invalid's cap and shawl, one ivory hand grasping the ebony stick with which she aided her faltering steps, and tbe sweet faded pink which lingered in her thin cheeks deepening into a feverish flush of distress and terror, it was impossible for a stronger nature to think of anything save of soothing and shielding the weaker being who ought to have been the younger woman's stay in her exposure to the storm. Accordingly in place of bemoaning the fate which, like an unknown country, lay stretched out dim and dark before her, or indulging in tears and sobs over the parting close at hand, Flora took to encouraging her mother. \" I don't think they will treat me badly, mother. General Campbell has behaved like a considerate gentleman and a friend. I have many more friends, and so have the Clanranalds and Lady Marget and Sir Alexander, to stick up for me and not see me wronged. I dare say I shall not be gone for long. It will be just like the visit to Edinburgh for"], [184, "164 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" my schooling and to see the world, and you made no objection to that.\" But the mistress of Armadale was not to be so easUy appeased. \" It is treason, girl, no less, and my Hugh was off to the moors to lie in hiding, as soon as we heard that you were arrested and carried on board the cutter, so that there was no help for you. Ochone ! What is to become of me and the bairns \u2014 and little Anabell is torn to pieces with the chincough, left to pine our leelones here, while Captain Hugh is catching his death, keeping company with caterans in their holes and dens, and you are in irons in a dungeon, waiting to be shipped to the Indies, or to be sentenced to the hangman's rope. That will bring you to your senses, Flora, that will break your unbridled spirit, for you were always a proud, undaunted peat of a lass. Woe's the day that ever such disgrace and sorrow were brought on me and mine. What tempted you, a young girl, to interfere in what was no woman's work ? You were just fuU of conceit about it, when you were here last. What was Angus about that he suffered you to be guilty of such hardihood ? What for did he not lock you up, rather than permit you to run into such deadly harm?\" \"Angus did what he could,\" said Flora quietly, knowing how to deal with her mother's panic. \" It is not Angus's fault that I am here as I am. If he had gone so far as to lock me up, well \" \u2014 with a faint smile \u2014 \" I think I would have found ways and means to get out. I'm sorry Captain Hugh has seen fit to take to the moors, but I do not think he will bide away long. When I am gone, the hue and cry will soon die out, and what would you have had me do, mother ? Wait and see a poor hunted young"], [185, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 165 man \u2014 the age of our Ranald when God took him \u2014 snared by the fowlers, before my eyes, when it was in my power to save him ? Would you have had the poor Clanranalds ruined stoup and roup, and me looking on, and capable of preventing the disaster ? But, let who will be blamed, I have only a short time to stay, mother, will you not help me to get what clothes I shall want ? Will you not speer round the servant maids for me, to see if you can find one of them who will care to go with me \u2014 that I may not be left longer than need be, the only woman in a ship full of men ? If the lass will go with me for love of the family, I and the friends I can count upon, will take care that she comes to no grief through waiting on me.\" The right chord was touched. The motherly instincts of poor Mrs. Macdonald, Armadale, were fairly roused. Flora was offered in turn, and that with entire sincerity, every article in her mother's ward robe, likely and unlikely, from the warmest plaid to the finest India muslin of Flora's own embroidering, from a quilted hood, to an amber necklace, to take with her in her exile. The biggest, stoutest lass in kitchen or hall \u2014 one Kate Macdowal or Macdonald, who had not a word of the Lowland Scotch, or the English, or of any other language than the Gaelic, a deficiency which, on the whole, might be more of a safeguard than a disadvantage, achieved the proud promotion of being selected out of many candidates to be waiting-maid and escort to Flora Milton. It scarcely detracted from the honour, it rather enhanced it, in the simple eyes of the natives, that Flora was starting under a guard of soldiers for the south, there to answer for the misdemeanour of having befriended one of the old royal Stuarts."], [186, "166 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" Flora had torn herself from her mother's weeping embrace, had hastfly wished everybody a kindly good bye, and was again embarked in the cutter's boat, with her luggage and Kate Macdowal, who was doubtful whether she ought not to take an oar in her strong right hand. Then a tradition crops up \u2014 if it is a veritable tradition, and not merely an artistic touch \u2014 a Uttle more cunning and a Uttle less clumsy than the other coarsely daubed details in the factitious narrative of Flora Macdonald's adventures, given in her name to the world, not many years ago. Her terrier dog had followed her, his head lowered, his tail between his legs after the fashion of a dog at a funeral. When the boat was pushing off he sprang desperately into the water, and would have swam after her had he not been caught up, dripping from every hair, and carried back by main force. Poor dog \" Sidger,\" poor mistress of \" Sidger,\" at that doleful moment. CHAPTER XIII. \" And coming events cast their shadows before.\" Campbell. Flora's first destination as a prisoner, was the house of the Governor of the Castle of Dunstaffnage. The ruined Castle had been a palace of the old Scotch kings \u2014 more than one of whom lay buried in sacred earth, in its vicinity. From Dunstaffnage the ancient \" Stone of Destiny\" on which the kings had sat at their primitive coronations, had been taken to Scone and to Westminster. So imposing was the extent of the pile, even in ruins, that within its massive walls, defended by their flanking towers at"], [187, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 167 each corner, there was space enough and to spare for the modern mansion of the Governor. From the mouldering gateway towards the sea, is a right royal view of lochs and islands, with green \" Morven \" conspicuous among the islands, in their girdle of mountains. Not far off is another ruin of great strength, that of the Castle of Dunolly, both Dunstaffnage and Dunolly having been, in their day, the almost impregnable holds of the Macdougals, who sought to crush Robert the Bruce. Scotland itself, does not display , another scene grander, more romantic, richer in historic associations. The letter which General Campwell wrote and for warded along with Flora to his clansman, Mr. Niel CampbeU, Governor of Dunstaffnage, was a very pretty and poUte letter. In its old-fashioned formality and gallantry, it did the writer's good breeding and soundness of heart great credit. The General re quested the Governor's \" good lady,\" through her husband, to do him the favour to receive for a few days \"a very pretty young rebel who had been persuaded by those who ought to have given her better advice, to let herself be drawn into a most unhappy scrape.\" Thus franked, Flora was not only treated with perfect civflity, she received a considerable amount of attention during the ten days she remained at Dunstaffnage. No doubt, there was a division of opinion among those home-keeping Highland ladies, and double distilled Whig Campbells with regard to the feat which the young gentlewoman had performed. Some of the more punctilious and straight-laced dames were startled and slightly scandalized by the action, while others \u2014 younger and less trammelled by rules and saws, thought it the"], [188, "168 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" finest thing in the world. The last were full of ad miration for Flora Macdonald's courage and endur ance, and were fain to be smitten by her generous humanity. Both admirers and critics united in acknowledging her sense and modesty, the simplicity with which she spoke, when she was forced to speak, of what she had done, and her good humoured docility in circumstances \u2014 in connection with which high-headed refactoriness and resentment would have caused great discomfort to all involved in the difficulty. \"I declare,\" the Governor's lady confided her private feehngs to her most intimate cronies, \"it is more like having an agreeable, obliging visitor than a prisoner \u2014 such as I never thought to have quartered in the house. When I heard first that we were to have the care of Miss Macdonald, MUton, I was frightened out of my wits. I had no thought but that she would \"flyte\" (scold) and greet from morning to night, if she did not try louping out of her window, or suborning the servants. But nothing of the kind. She's as douce and easy to please, and as good with the bairns as if she were here for her pleasure and ours. She found no fault with the man Niel had to station outside her room door, the first night she came, any more than with the sentry at the castle gate. She's just fine company, as I have said. She keeps her cares to herself, poor girl, and I'm sure she drinks to King George's health with the lave. When I remarked upon her complacency, she said, ' Madam, are you not aware that Sir Alexander Macdonald is my chief? Forby\" \u2014 and here she laughed \u2014 \"is it to wish him you caU the Pretender ill, to wish King George well ? Let them and wiser folk than me, settle their disputes, for"], [189, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 169 themselves.' 'Deed, yes, the young lady will be excellent company, she's a fine hand at her needle, and flowers most beautiful, and we have not been so gay with a throng of visitors at Dunstaffnage, not for many a weary day, till General Campbell's fair rebel set her foot amongst us.\" At first there had not been one of Flora's near relatives or personal friends, among the flocks of ladies and gentleman who besieged the mansion house of Dunstaffnage, in order to see and speak with the young gentlewoman from the Long Island, who had been capable of setting the Government at defiance, and accomplishing so daring a deed as the rescue of Prince Charles. Even after ample time had been given for her kindred to journey to the Land of Lorn, and seek admission to the prisoner's presence, for her comfort and encouragement, not a Macdonald appeared. Flora was reasonable, if ever woman was. She knew that for her friends to come to her, though the demonstration might afford her a momentary gratification, would serve to compromise both her and them, in fact, might render her position twice as bad as before the interview. Because for her to have acted on a foolish impulse of womanly sensibility was one thing, while for her to have been the willing tool of a band of conspirators was quite another con sideration, and one much less susceptible of defence. She was convinced that all her friends \u2014 the Clan ranalds, Lady Marget, Milton who had threatened beforehand to give her up, and suffer her to reap the harvest of her criminal rashness, were at work on her behalf \u2014 still it was lonesome and \" dowie \" as Flora expressed the feeling, to find herself alone among strangers, in the first adversity that had"], [190, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 170 befallen her, to be conscious of even the suspicion of being forsaken and abandoned to whatever chastise ment the authorities chose to inflict upon her. It was not so very long ago \u2014 not so long as to have passed out of men's reckoning \u2014 since the young girls who had been beguiled into meeting and greeting Monmouth in his fated attempt on his uncle's throne, had been subjected to savage insult and brutal reprisals. One can then imagine the flood of relief and affectionate gratitude and pleasure with which Flora, walking for exercise as she was accustomed to do, within the old Castle courtyard, and unaccompanied \u2014 for a wonder \u2014 by any member of the family or visitor coveting her society, saw her cousin, Lorraine Macdonald from Kilmossie, with her couple of gillies, ride in on her white pony. Flora was at Lorraine's side in a moment, helping her to alight, and welcoming her gladly. \" Oh, Lorraine, how kind of you to come ! It is good to see a kenned face among so many fremed ones before I go south. I'm blythe, blythe to see you. I'm only vexed because of the fatigue of the journey for you, and you not strong, and for what Milton may say to your expedition.\" \"Milton may say what he likes,\" answered Lor raine, who was as dazzlingly fair, as daintily fine, and as audaciously Jacobite as ever. It is no business of his. I came for my own pleasure.\" \"Well, then, I'll take you at once to Mrs. Camp bell, who is very kind and hospitable. I'm sure neither she nor the Governor will refuse to receive you, and make you free to rest and refreshment, as a friend and kinswoman of mine, come to bid me good-bye, for all that you wear the white cockade on"], [191, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 171 your breast in one of King George's castles,\" and Flora glanced doubtfully and disapprovingly at Lor raine's badge. \" I never hide my colours,\" said Lorraine, defiantly. \"No; but you've heard of the texts, to 'render unto C\u00e6sar the things that are C\u00e6sar's,' and to ' honour the king,' whoever he may be, whUe he is the king, I take it. You cannot call it honouring him to flaunt his enemy's token in his Majesty's face, or in the faces of his servants, which is much the same thing. That is a very different proceeding from denying your creed, if so be you have a clear creed.\" \" I care not,\" said Lorraine, recklessly, \" and I want no rest and refreshment from my king's foes.\" \"You'll not be such a Me, Lorraine,\" Flora told her firmly; \"you'll take what I ask for you, in my name, unless you mean to do me despite, after you've come all this way to show me your good will. It is not for the like of you to repair to a change-house, and without meat and drink, you'll never be able to get even as far as the nearest ferry to the Long Island.\" Lorraine submitted so far to Flora's urgent repre sentations. She was presented to Mrs. Campbell, and accepted the invitation to join the company at their early dinner ; but she was silent and distrait, with a shade of haughtiness in her manner to all who addressed her with interest. For Lorraine, too, was worth seeing and speaking to, though for other reasons than came into play with regard to her cousin. The fame of Lorraine as a belle and a beauty, an heiress, and the possessor of mysterious gifts reached beyond the Long Island."], [192, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 172 Lorraine was even stiff and sUent to the kinswoman whom she had journeyed to see, in what some people might have caUed disgrace as well as danger. \" What ails you, Lorraine ? You're not like your self,\" remonstrated Flora in perplexity, as the two young women were permitted to walk apart within the precincts. \" Nothing ails me,\" cried Lorraine, petulantly. \" It is not I who am to blame, it is you, who have failed me. Oh, Flora ! how could you cheat me so, the last time we met ? You knew I would have given my life to go the gate you were going, and render the service to the Prince which all the world is making an outcry about. Yet you held your tongue, and stole a march upon me. Was that fair ? Was that kind when I had opened aU my heart to you, and you were as well advised as I that I worshipped the very ground my Prince walked upon ? \" \" My dear,\" said Flora, patiently, \" to have told you would have been to betray others, and more people could not have been taken into the secret without jeopardizing the whole performance. Do you not see that for yourself?\" Lorraine was appeased with some trouble, and then Flora ventured to give her views on the bone of contention. \" As for your Prince, now that I've seen him and spoken with him, and travelled days in his company, he's not a nonsuch, Lorraine. He's a bonnie laddie, that cannot be denied, and a canty callan'. Oh, how he held his sides and laughed at the spectacle he presented in a woman's clothes ! He's brave and kind and princely.\" Flora willingly admitted the merits of her former companion. \" He's just fit \u2014 what with his youth, his good looks, his royal rank,"], [193, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 173 his gallantry, and above all his misfortunes, to be the hero of a song or a story, and many will be made upon him. But when I think upon him again, I misdoubt if he's fit to be a king, even if he had gausey Kingsbarrow to hold him back from the drink, and if the Prince were to marry a princess as hand some and clever and as devoted to him and his interests, as I've been told King George's German Queen Caroleen was to him, while she was to the fore.\" Lorraine flung back her head, but said nothing. \"And if I misdoubt his Royal Highness for a king,\" persisted Flora, \" still more would I have misdoubted him had he been no prince, but a common man, for a lover and husband. Never, never ! He's not, with all his graces, the cut of a leal lover and a husband steadfast till death.\" \"But, you see, he's not a common man, and so cannot be measured by your standard,\" objected Lorraine, peevishly. \" You were always hard to please, Flora Milton, and here there's naebody speering your pleasure that I know of.\" \"Naebody,\" owned Flora, and her accents fell sadly on the ear. Then Lorraine's feelings took a new direction. She sat down on a fragment of the masonry of a ruined window and began to sob, wring her hands, and rock herself to and fro, Flora standing by and striving to calm her. \" Oh, to think I should wyte you, Flora,\" moaned Lorraine, \" after what you have done for him, and you going away on such an errand. Yet, if you will believe me, I would not, if I had got my choice, have been left behind. I would have laid my head on the block for him ; and though you are strong and I am"], [194, "174 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" weak, I think I would have said, \"God bless my Prince,' with my dying breath.\" \" I believe you would, Lorraine,\" said Flora. \" But I'm not going to lay my head on the block, if I can help it ; and 'deed I think nobody wUl ask me to go so far and have my blude upon their heads, as I would have had Prince Charles's blude on mine, if I had not done the best I could for him.\" Then Flora's sense of humour came to her aid, while it struck her that, if she could get Lorraine to look at the affair in a less romantically tragic light, it might do the girl good, by bringing her down from her pinnacle of exalted despair. There would be a chance of getting Lorraine to relinquish some of her extravagant fancies, if she saw them touched with absurdity, by being brought into contact with the dire prosaicness of the commonplace. \" My dear, neither you nor me are of a rank to be beheaded. What put that into your head? What tempted you to think that we should be treated Uke guilty queens and princesses, or Uke noble women at the very least ? If we were condemned to death we should just have to mount the common gallows and be hanged by the neck like any ordinary thief and vagabond. Wae's me ! many an honest gentleman has suffered the indignity this year, but no gentle woman that I have heard tell of, and I've no desire to set the example.\" Once more Lorraine sat silent with averted head. \"No. What I do fear,\" went on Flora, gravely, \" is that they will shut me up \u2014 me that is a Hielant woman born and bred\u2014 like a bird in a cage, and keep me in a prison \u2014 maybe for years \u2014 in some dull country gaol, if I'm not thought worthy of the Tower, where I will pine away and die just of home-sickness."], [195, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 175 I can guess how I would long, with a useless longing, for a sight of the heather hills and a sound of the waves washing on the shores of the Long Island, and a feel of the wind raging down the mountain side.\" When Flora had ceased speaking she still kept looking wistfully on what was left her of her north country, in the matchless landscape at her feet. \" It is bonnie, bonnie,\" she said, with a long sighing breath. \" Oh, my bonnie Scotland ! Must I bid you farewell for ever ? \" Lorraine had not answered her cousin, unless by looking blankly discomfited and querulous, as she leant back against what was left of the heavy window frame, and plucked with restless fingers at the moss and wild thyme growing in the rents of the stone. Then the strain of superstition in Flora's blood impelled her to put certain questions to her cousin, the mere uttering of which blanched her cheeks, and caused her young face to look for the moment drawn and haggard. \" Had you any warrant for what you said enow, Lorraine. I mean about the headsman's block ? Have you seen anything lately that could mislead you, and induce you to come to so wild a conclusion ? \" \" No,\" replied Lorraine a trifle sulkily, while she was alike without the power, and the serious wish, to resist and refuse to satisfy Flora with regard to the enlightenment she required. Neither would Lorraine seek to misrepresent to her cousin or to any one else, the nature of her visions. They were far too solemn and sacred, in the girl's eyes, to be thus mishandled and perverted. She would not have dared to do it, and she would have scorned to do it. There was not a particle of hypocrisy in what sceptical people would have regarded as her hysterical enthusiasm."], [196, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 176 \" But I did see you one night, Flora,\" she asserted, \" though I cannot make tap-tail or main of the circumstances. I've racked my brain trying to look back into the dream, and all I have done has been to cause my head to ache and swim. I cannot under stand the vision.\" \"Where and how did you see me? \" pressed Flora, unable to resist feeling keenly interested, while the interest was dashed with more than the usual amount of incredulity, which her reason supplied. If the dreamer herseh could not interpret the dream it was surely rather a lying spirit speaking by her mouth, than a trustworthy warning given in time to profit the hearer. Nevertheless Flora was human, Scotch, a Highland woman, therefore on the eve of her departure from the country in an iU-omened fashion, she adjured Lorraine to reveal what she could of her kinswoman's clouded and uncertain fortunes. \" If you will have it,\" said Lorraine half reluctantly, \"I saw you in a strange place, the like of which I never beheld before. There was a mist of heat and wet over everything. The low-lying fields were a hantle greener even than the pasture and bear are on a June day in the Long Island. The haze was so heavy and sultry, it was fit to choke you. There was a forest of trees hard by, but the trunks and leaves and fruit of the trees were unUke those of any trees I have been accustomed to, only I thought I spied yellow oranges, and apples \u2014 but not the same as our apples in the Lowlands. There were men and women moving in and out of low little houses, like our bothies, but they were not theeked with heather. The folk had no more clothing than cotton gowns, jackets, and breeches, and if you wUl believe me, Flora, the wearers' faces were as black as the soles of my shoon ! \""], [197, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 177 \" It must have been the Indies,\" cried Flora, aghast. \" Oh, they'U never be going to ship me to the plantations.\" \"There was a log-house half smothered with plants growing rank on the waUs, and hanging over the pahngs,\" went on Lorraine, not minding the interruption. Her cheeks, too, were bloodless, her lips fallen apart, and she stared straight before her into the lambent summer air, with her great pale eyes, as if she saw still the scene she sought to describe. \"You were in the doorway of the house, you \u2014 a middle-aged, care-worn woman, with grey threads in the hah below your mutch. You had your hand held up to shade your eyes, for the red sun was setting the colour of blood, and you looked north and south, and east and west, but you did not see what you looked for. \"Then you turned and went into the house, and I followed you in the spirit. You opened a closed door, and stepped into a chamber, and the first thing I saw was two little coffins \u2014 not so wee as to be for weans, but middle size for halflins, lying side by side within the door. I looked to the bed and there, sure enough, under a sheet which you lifted up were a little lad and a little lass, with their night-gowns laid in straight folds, and their cowls as neat and undisturbed round then: pinched white faces. Their hands and their feet were still, and then- een were closed. I saw them and you softly smoothing the sheet and looking down on them, as plain as I see you now, and then them and you and the whole place vanished, and I was shivering and greeting in the morning light in my room at KUmossie.\" \"I can make nothing of it,\" said Flora, after a thoughtful pause. I have heard cailags teU it was N"], [198, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 178 an unchancy dream to find yourself with a \"mur ning \" infant in your arms, that you could neither put to sleep, nor give to another to take in charge, nor get rid of yourself, though it was none of yours, do what you would. But you say these were halflin bairns, they were my belongings, and they were dead, puir things ! and could not long trouble anybody. No, neither can I comprehend. I think you must have been only dreaming this time, Lorraine, or you must have mistaken another woman for me.\" \"It was no common dream,\" said Lorraine, with conviction. \" If you kenned what a trance meant, you would not speak as you're doing, and I never make mistakes when I'm out of myself. I could not, for you see it is not my mortal eyes which look upon the spectacles that I would fain not behold. You should not ask me to tell you what I've seen, if you have not the faith to believe in it.\" This was an unanswerable argument. A troublesome, and, as it turned out, a vexatious question arose as to how and with whom Flora was to travel from Dunstaffnage to Edinburgh. As ill luck would have it, of all the people in the world to be appointed for the duty, Captain John Macleod of Balmeonach was the man, while Flora was too proud and too reasonable to enter a loud protest against the selection. Why should not Captain John escort her on her way ? True, he bore her a grudge for having out-man\u0153uvred him, and snatched his prey from his grasp at Monkstadt. But the grudge might be so far appeased by the plight in which he now found her. The fact of Flora's being a prisoner, his prisoner for the time, was certainly a sop to his wounded vanity and surly arrogance. On the other hand, Captain John was restrained"], [199, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 179 in the rude tyranny which might have rendered her position more galling, by the recollection of General Campbell, Mr. NeU Campbell, the governor of Dun staffnage and his \" good lady,\" together with all the worshipful company, which, for want of anything better to do had been so silly as to travel a dozen miles to look at, listen to and defer to a brazen-faced jade who had stepped out of her place to outwit an honourable gentleman. It was the thought of General Campbell which was most effectual. Captain John with all his dour clownishness had his sensitiveness to public opinion, and was not without aspirations to be regarded as a fine gentleman and officer, distinguished by his polish and high breeding, as well as by his courage and zeal. He took his tone, as far as he was capable of taking it, from the model presented to him. He treated Flora with solemn consideration and lofty politeness, in their voyage in the wherry when they glided in these late summer days down Loch Etive, and the sound of Mull, by the Kyles of Bute, into the River Clyde, past Argyle's Bowling Green, and the rock and castle of Dumbarton to Glasgow. From Glasgow, a hackney coach conveyed them to Edin burgh. It was the same route which Flora had traversed in her early girlhood, in a smack laden with cod, and by the mail coach, in order to join the household of Sir Alexander and Lady Macdonald and be put to school with the Miss Hendersons at their \"siminary\" in the_old Stamp-office Close, opposite the High Street. Flora was safely deposited at last, not with any of her former friends who would have volunteered to be surety for her appearance, at the proper time, to receive sentence for her misdemeanour, but in his"], [200, "180 \"THE MACDONALD LASS:' Majesty's ship the Bridgewater, commanded by Commodore Smith, and stationed in Leith Roads, where it was to wait to take in batches of prisoners to be conveyed to London, for trial before the Commissioners appointed by Government for the purpose. CHAPTER XIV. \" The ship rides by the Berwick Law.\" Burns. Flora Macdonald was not only treated with all humanity and courtesy, in the cabin allotted to her and Kate Macdowal, by all on board the Bridgewater, Commodore Smith naturaUy came to regard her as a young lady of some consequence, entitled to the respect and indulgence which her modesty and dis cretion prevented her from abusing, when he found the elite of Edinburgh society, the Whig as well as the Tory elite, hurrying down to Leith in coaches and chairs, and on their honourable feet, craving leave to come on board his vessel, and be presented to his prisoner. He could not permit her to go on shore, but he could consent to her receiving company from the Scotch capital \u2014 company which he could soon see was of an influential and choice description \u2014 within proper limits and at fit seasons. Indeed, being a genial man of more mind and better manners than were often to be found on the quarter-deck at that date, his social and intellectual vanity was flattered by the kind of visitors who besieged his ship. He was sensible that they, and the young lady whom they came to see, conferred on"], [201, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 181 the Bridgewater and its Commodore a certain distinc tion not enjoyed by other ships and commodores. He was ready to show himself, in return, within the rules of the service, the most urbane and hospitable of officers and hosts. It happened, however, that the first acquaintances who greeted Flora on board the Bridgewater, were not particularly calculated to raise her in the Commodore's estimation. They were two of her fellow-prisoners. One of them was the Irishman, O'Neal, with whom she had parted on the night of the supper in the cavern in Benbecula, before she sailed with the Prince to Skye. O'Neal had been taken prisoner the same night. Happily for him, he had offered no resistance, he had surrendered at discretion to those of Captain Fergusson's men who had been placed as scouts round the house of Ormi clade. O'Neal was building his hopes of a pardon on his surrender, on the lack of trouble he had given at last to his captors, when, to be sure, nothing was to be gained by farther resistance, and on the com parative mediocrity of his rank and influence among the Prince's followers. For the last month O'Neal had received the good treatment shown by civihzed combatants to prisoners of war. He was in a very different condition from that in which Flora had last seen him. He had been well-fed and well-clad, according to his station, with his sanguine expectations raised in proportion. He was in a plight to condole with Flora when he took her hand and said gravely \u2014 \"Miss Macdonald, I am both glad and sorry to see you here.\" She saw his meaning \u2014 he was glad that she had accomplished her mission, but sorry that she was"], [202, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 182 suffering for what she had done. She answered him with unexpected magnanimity. \" So am I, Captain O'Neal, and on the whole I'm gladder than I'm sorry.\" She repeated her assertion emphaticaUy when he was able to give her the private information that the Prince had not been traced to Moidart and arrested there, according to a rumour which was then in circulation. Still Captain O'Neal, faring like a gentleman, and in no extreme danger according to his representa tions, was less interesting to Flora than O'Neal the wanderer, hunted day and night, foraging for his Prince at the expense of his own wants. It seemed to her that his comparative prosperity brought out the faults in his character which adversity had borne down and concealed. He complained vehemently that he had been deprived of his gold watch, and of no less a sum than six hundred pounds sterhng, which he had kept about his person, and he accused no less a person than General CampbeU, by whose orders the depredation had been committed, of being the gainer by his, O'Neal's, loss. Flora, who was no red-hot Tory or fanatical Jacobite, had difficulty in restraining a laugh at the part which General Campbell was made to play in the offence. As for the six hundred pounds, if they did not owe their existence solely to Irish swagger and brag, she believed they could not have been the private property of Captain O'Neal, who probably never in the course of his life owned such a sum, and, if he did, was not likely to go on a campaign with it hidden in the lining of his coat. It must have been part of the four thousand pounds sent over from France for the supply of Prince Charles's needs,"], [203, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 183 and entrusted to different hands, to be ready for his use in various parts of the country. Flora was not unwiUing that Captain O'Neal should thenceforth pass out of her life. She had much more sympathy with Malcolm Macleod of Raasay, who was also in custody, and on his way to London. The cousins, young Raasay and his brother, who had been concerned in the same offence, had got favour shown to them, on the ground of the elder brother having been on the government side in the late rising, while Malcolm had not only joined his uncle and chief in ranging a portion of the clan under the rebel standard, he himself had been of sufficient mark to hold a captain's commission in the Prince's army. Poor Malcolm was very down hearted, and hung his big yeUow head unmistakably. No wonder, he had just stood a mournful parting with his wife and children; and he was possessed with the idea that he was going up to London to be hanged, while all that was left for him to do was to be thankful that he was in good company, and to make up his mind to behave like a man, and be no disgrace to his family and his clan. Flora, who could not shake herself free of the notion that she had helped to get the poor fellow into the scrape, spent a portion of her time in vainly trying to reassure him. Flora's Edinburgh company, which made so strong an impression on Commodore Smith was of quite another character. First and foremost came my lord, the President of the Court of Session, which had been in abeyance for a whole year, but had resumed its sittings during the month of July just past, with the Laird of Culloden once more at its head. He was doubtless"], [204, "184 \" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" asked to do what he could in the matter by his friends, Sir Alexander and Lady Marget Macdonald of Monkstadt. But there was no lack of interest, on his own account, in the modest, bright young girl who had been one of his fellow-passengers during that pleasant fortnight's summer \" sail \" in the packet The Brothers between Leith and Inverness. He had met her on other occasions during her stay with the Macdonalds ; and quite recently there had been an opportunity for renewing their friendly inter course, when he and Lord Loudon were in Skye, in the spring of the year '-16, at the very time, as it chanced, that the battle of Culloden was fought at the president's door, on the mainland. The two gentlemen had been engaged in seeking to confirm the allegiance of the islanders to the House of Hanover. But where Flora was concerned, when was Duncan Forbes absent when an act of generous kindness was to be done ? The president was a long-nosed, pleasant-mouthed, large-limbed, handsome man, of fine presence, whether in his lawyer's wig and gown, or in his low-necked coat, long vest, knee breeches, and cambric cravat and ruffles. It was many a long day since the fiery young advocate, Duncan Forbes, had walked by the side of his condemned client, Captain Green, amidst the hoots and yells of an infuriated mob, to the Grass-market, where an innocent man was hung, in spite of his counsel's passionate protest. It was many a year since Duncan Forbes had met, wooed, and won Mary Rose by the grey stone which still preserves the memory of their loves, in the birk-scented woods of Kilravock. His wedded bliss soon came to an end. Death took his Mary, but that early love-dream was a sacred spot in his heart,"], [205, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 185 and left the Lord President with a softened side to all women. \"What is this you've been about, Flora Milton?\" He hailed the girl with a twinkle in his shrewd, good humoured eyes, as he met her on the quarter-deck of the Bridgewater. \" Have you forgotten all the loyal arguments you heard from me on board The Brothers and at Ormiclade, no farther gone than the spring. It seems I might have kept my breath to cool my porridge. What fine scrape is this you have got into, my young madam ? \" \"I did nobody any wrong,\" Flora defended herself, using her usual argument, \" unless you call it wrong to befriend a man in desperation.\" Then an answer ing twinkle came into her steel-blue eyes. \" 'Deed, my Lord President, I did no more than what I believe you yourself would have done in my place.\" \"Whisht, whisht ! There must be no treason spoken on board one of his Majesty's ships, even though the speaker be a fair rogue.\" He rebuked her with more indulgence than severity. \"But we must do the best we can for you, because of auld acquaintance' sake, though I had as lief you were aware the wind of court favour does not blow strong in my sails ; I am sorry \u2014 not only on your account, but in the interests of Sir Alexander and other worthy gentle men who have stood steadily by the White Horse.\" Flora knew already the wide-spread tale of the Government's ingratitude to the great Whig leader who had half ruined himself in the Whig cause, who had withdrawn from the House of Stuart, and given to the House of Hanover the support of not less than ten thousand men, who in his own person had narrowly escaped one of the nefarious plots of the wily old fox, Simon Fraser, for kidnapping the"], [206, "186 ': THE MACDONALD LASS.\" President, making short work with him on the spot, or carrying him beyond the seas. All these good deeds were cancelled by two acts of stubborn truth and justice. Duncan Forbes de clined to conceal or slur over, in the report with which he furnished the authorities, the abominable cruelties perpetrated under the Duke of Cumber land's rule at Inverness, and he refused as stoutly to admit, from his own knowledge, that the barbarities were warranted by similar misconduct on the part of the Jacobites. The President was well pleased to talk to an intelli gent and sympathetic listener of the prospects of Skye and of the friends common to both. He liked to hear from her own lips the particulars of her adven tures and to recall incidents of his recent visit to the Hebrides. \" Do you mind yon game of penny-stanes, Miss Macdonald?\" he said, among his other reminiscences, while his hazel eyes, always with an underlying thoughtfulness in their greatest waggery, took the speculative, far-away look of a man who in the middle of his shrewdness could dream dreams on occasions. The allusion was to a game of quoits played by some of the stalwart Skye men, of which Duncan Forbes had been an eye-witness. In the course of the game, one of the players \u2014 a weaver by trade \u2014 had faUen down, in what would now be regarded as an epileptic fit, but which was then held to be a trance. On his recovery, he volunteered a minute description of a battle which he had seen pass before his fixed and glazed eyes. Men's minds were in excited expecta tion of a decisive battle between the forces under the Duke of Cumberland and those under Prince Charles, and it happened that it took place on the very day, at"], [207, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 187 the very hour, when the game of quoits or \"penny stanes \" had been played. In listening to the man's ravings of his vision, the President had believed he recognized some of the land-marks, casually men tioned, as answering to the familiar features of his own moor of Drummossie, to be thenceforth full of weird and woeful associations. Chance coincidences and adroit guesses were not then the reading of aU marvels, and even after an interval of four months, the man who was a fair student of Hebrew and a scholar who dipped pretty considerably into the well of Oriental literature \u2014 a sealed fountain to the public of a hundred years ago \u2014 still shook his \" wise-like head,\", and avowed with conviction \u2014 \" Ay, ay, the information came very close, and was by ordinary, though what end it was to serve, at that date, I'm at a loss to say. But we're not at the bottom of all things in creation \u2014 not yet a while \u2014 are we, mistress Flora?\" CHAPTER XV. 14 The cup which cheers, but not inebriates.\" Cowper. It was by the Lord President's doing that the next noted visitor arrived at the Bridgewater, and claimed an introduction to Miss Flora Macdonald. On his way from the Parliament House next day, before stepping into the coach which was to carry him out to Stony HaU, the great man looked in at the book-shop and library, with the sign of the heads of Ben Jonson and Drummond of Hawthom den, opposite the Cross, and at the end of the"], [208, "188 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" Luckenbooths. The shop was the resort of all the literati of Edinburgh, while it was not yet abandoned by its founder and owner, notwithstanding he had already made his modest fortune, and obtained leave from the magistrates of the city to build his \" cage \" for his \" burd \" on the magnificent site of the Castle Rock. Duncan Forbes had been a friendly patron to Thomson of the \" Seasons,\" but AUan Ramsay was the President's intimate crony, since that day a score of years back, when the young advocate was one of the interested group who listened in Forbes' uncle's house, to the first reading of the \" Gentle Shepherd \" by its author. \"Man, AUan,\" said the President, \"I'm in a deevil of a hurry, but I'm fain to look in to tell you, that if you want the finest subject you've gotten yet, for your muse, you'll find her in the Leith Roads, on board his Majesty's ship the Bridgewater. She's the Macdonald lass from Skye and the Long Island, that all Edinburgh, aU the country, is wild about. You've only to say that I've sent you to get a crack with her, and maybe a dish of tea from her hands. And when I next see you, I'll waur my poor brother Jock's nut * against your owning that she's the bonniest, and the cheeriest, and the blythest lassie under a cloud, that you've ever set een upon.\" \" I'm obhged to you, sir,\" said the stout little man addressed, pushing his spectacles up on his forehead ; \" but as for my muse, though she let me ride her fairly for many a day, she's proved but a sorry jaud in the long run, she's refused to go a step at my bidding, ere I was well through my forties. Not * A cocoanut filled with champagne, which the former laird of Culloden had been wont to ask his visitors to crack."], [209, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 189 that I've prigged her sore, for when the fire of youth is spent, and sober manhood is on its decline, where is the poet's fine phrenzy to come from, I should like to ken . But I'U avail myself of your name, by your leave, and take a look of the lass all the world's looking at. I've been at the heels of most of the fine sichts which were going in my day,\" the poet finished crousely. Thus Allan Ramsay went down to Leith, and sought an interview with Flora. Some of the flutter with which she would have received the compliment was dissipated by the gravity of her situation. She could not be moved by an honour done her, as she would have been, in happier days, when she was at liberty and as free from care as a girl could be, because aU was well with her and her friends. But, as it was, she rose to the occasion. For was not Allan Ramsay her country's poet, of whom she had heard all her life, whose poetry she had read and admired from the time when she was first capable of intelligent appreciation of its beauty ? It did not need the fact that \"The Gentle Shepherd \" was dedicated to Lady Marget Macdonald's mother, the superb old gentlewoman, Susannah Countess of Eglintoun, for Flora to be as well ac quainted with the rural charms of \" Habbie's Howe \" as with the wild and stern glories of Skye and the Long Island. Her interest in Peggy and Patie, Jenny and Roger, had been as lively and affectionate as if the Lowland lads and lassies had been her Highland clansmen and clanswomen. As for Allan Ramsay's \"Tea-table Miscellany of Song,\" eagerly conned by all the singers, in every household to which Lowland Scotch was open,"], [210, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 190 throughout Scotland, she had been proud to think that she had a share in the dedications of that popular production. For was she not one of the lasses so gallantly apostrophized by the editor ? 44 To ilka lovely British lass, Frae Lady Charlotte, Anne, and Jean, Down to ilk bonny singing Bess Wha dances on the gTeen.\" Though Allan had not hitherto possessed any personal knowledge of the heroine proposed for him, she had been acquainted with him by sight, as was natural, since he was the weU-known poet, and she was the modest, obscure young gentlewoman under the Miss Hendersons' care, or in Sir Alexander Mac donald's household. Flora had gone eagerly of a morning, with her neighbours \u2014 high and low, and paid her penny for the broad sheet which contained \" Allan Ramsay's last piece.\" Surely no minor poet ever enjoyed a more friendly and sympathetic audience of his townspeople. Flora had also been privileged to take out her \"sets\" of books, improving travels, essays, belles lettrea generally, and high-flown novels long forgotten, from the first lending library in Scotland. Sometimes the master of the shop had kindly condescended to preside over the transaction, and to recommend this or that author \u2014 a recommendation most respectfully attended to. Ah ! but Allan was changed \u2014 even within Flora's recollection, greatly changed \u2014 since pretty Christian Ross, the solicitor's daughter, whom he met first at one of those social aud intellectual Edinburgh tea parties he commemorated in his \"Miscellany,\" came herself, instead of sending her maidservant, once a fortnight, with her father's wig for the young wig-"], [211, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 191 maker to curl. That first shop of his, the scene of these encounters, was in no more out-of-the-way and retired locality than was his last ; it was at the sign of the Mercury by the Cross Well \u2014 for he always loved a stirring spot, full of human interest, for his labours, whether mechanical or intellectual. Not the utmost stretch of imagination could now regard the bodily presence of the little man, in the resolutely favourable light in which he had set his stunted figure and swarthy complexion at twenty-four years of age. No one now, alas, could call him \u2014 44 A black-a-viced, snod, dapper fallow Nor lean, nor over-laid with tallow.\" The black-a-vicedness remained, it is true, though he had striven to tone it down, oblivious of the comicality of the contrast, by a light scratch wig, but the tallow had gained over muscle and bone, till the snod dapper figure had now the rotundity of a barrel. The well-turned legs on which he had piqued himself, had degenerated under the burden imposed on them, to a pair of spindleshanks. He was fast getting toothless ; all that remained of what pretensions to good looks he could ever have claimed, were the lively dark eyes rendered more conspicuous by the light wig, under which they flashed and sparkled with much of the gaiety and good humour of his youth. Nevertheless, sorrow had touched even prosperous and cheery Allan, and done something to subdue his \" crouseness.\" He had lost the \"burd\"for whom he had built the cage on the Castle Rock, and her mate who had been so ready to celebrate every event \u2014 glad or sad \u2014 in the lives of his friends and contem poraries, sat mute and drooping on his perch. The shaft had struck too near to his own heart. He"], [212, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 192 could not write an elegy on the faithful companion of thirty years, the love of his youth, on whose superior rank and her condescension in accepting his hand, he had passed many a merry joke. He had still his son, Allan, the painter whom his father had sent to Rome in order to perfect him in his art, who was now a rising artist in the fashionable world of London, and the three comely devoted daughters of whom their father boasted that there was not a \" wally draigle \" among them. He was yet to have the satisfaction of numbering among the privileged loungers in his shop the English poet Gay, who was in the train of Kitty, Duchess of Queensberry, and of hearing from him that the unapproachable judge, Mr. Pope, delighted in \" the Gentle Shepherd,\" and desired to have the Scotch words translated for his benefit. But all these honours could not make up for the crowning loss which robbed the remaider of life of its zest, or recall the vanished spring and summer of the past. There was no lack of conversation between old Allan Ramsay and young Flora Macdonald. He was moved to say several times in approval of her answers to his question, \" Fine, very fine, my dear young miss ; you may take my word for it that one does not hear, every day, of such courage and constancy in the interests of common humanity, rather than of any King George or King James among them.\" In speaking of her destination he half warmed into offering her a letter of introduction to his distinguished son, but canny Allan remembered in time that there was some word of young Allan's succeeding to the post of Court painter \u2014 a grand preferment with which any complications with rebels or their shelterers and defenders might interfere. Accordingly he suffered"], [213, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 193 his rash proposal to die away in the indistinct mumble which the absence of his teeth was apt to produce. When his articulation became plain again, Flora found that he was benevolently volunteering to lend her a set or two of books from his library, to occupy her on her voyage, and to help to pass the time in her \u2014 ahem ! \u2014 her, no doubt, short and light captivity. The books might be returned when an opportunity pre sented itself. Flora gratefuUy accepted the offer. She was the last woman in the world to expect or exact from her neighbours more than they were inclined to bestow. Her estimate of her claims was unaffectedly low, with the true and not the false humility which belongs to genuine nobility of character. Flora had the honour of making tea for Allan Ramsay, or was it Allan Ramsay who had the honour of receiving four cups of tea from Flora Macdonald, at that tea-table in the cabin of the Bridgewater over which she was said to preside with much womanly grace and housewifely bounty, for the space of three months ? A century or so ago was what Germans call \" the blossoming time \" of the tea-table, when it was rendered illustrious by Allan Ramsay and William Cowper, when Goethe wishing to represent Werther's Charlotte's attractions in their feminine perfection, described her cutting bread-and-butter for children at a tea-table. Among the traditions which survive of Flora Macdonald at this stage of her career, there is a vivid recollection of the quiet self-possession and natural dignity and elegance with which she did the honours of the tea-table to which so many guests invited themselves. She was entitled to be proficient in the dainty art of making and dispensing tea. Had 0"], [214, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 194 she not served her apprenticeship to such experts as the Miss Hendersons, Lady Marget, and Lady Clanranald ? Had she not practised the accomplish ment betimes at MUton and Armadale ? After the Lord President of the Court of Session and Poet Allan, the throng of company was made up of comparatively insignificant items. That did not prevent the young hostess's heart from being full of warm welcome for the Use-long friends she had made during that portion of her girlhood she had spent in Edinburgh \u2014 the Mackenzies of Delvin, and the family of Bishop Forbes, Leith. It seems the mitred bishop entertained no hostility or disdain towards the granddaughter of \"the strong minister\" in his Geneva gown and bands. At a distance from the last in Flora's loyal reckoning were such high-headed Jacobite dames as Lady Mary Cochrane, Lady Bruce, Lady Clerk. Flora's reasonable weU-balanced nature was dis tressed by the extravagant adulation of these ladies. Why should Lady Clerk be so foohsh as to declare herself willing to wipe Flora Macdonald's shoes ? Why should Lady Mary pretend to be iU, and unable to go on shore with the rest of the company, and then profess she had done it in order to be able to say she had passed the night with Flora Macdonald ? Their fantastic enthusiasm made Flora \"think shame\" both for them and for herself. It reminded her of poor Lorraine's \"maggots.\" Flora was by no means insensible to honest com mendation, but she had no mind to be made the fashion in Edinburgh for the autumn. She did not care to serve as an additional inducement for a ride or a drive down to \" Leith Sands,\" which at certain seasons competed successfully with the Duke's Walk"], [215, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 195 in the King's Park, as a public promenade for the aristocrats of the Canongate and the High Street, and their select closes. These senseless fine folk would have had carpet dances and early suppers on board the Bridgewater, by way of keeping lip Flora's spirits, and paying her a compliment, while the leading spirits met with no opposition on the part of the blandly gracious Commodore. But Flora absolutely declined to stand up \u2014 even in the most decorous of minuets or subdued of country dances. What ! Dance voluntarily on no compulsion, considering her plight and that of many of her friends in trouble ! Could any proposal be more unsuitable, more unbecoming ? She would sing her sweet Gaelic \"Waking of the Fauld,\" or \" CalUng of the Cattle,\" when she was asked, if it would give the listeners any pleasure. She was ready to oblige them, though her heart was heavy, and she felt as if her voice must be out of tune, but her compliance could go no farther. She was glad to let the excuse be made for her that so long as the Prince's fate remained uncertain, she could not be expected to dance. What did these troops of idle pursuers of novel pleasures, these lovers of exciting sensations, know of the bitterness of her strong spirit ? CHAPTER XVI. \" Thou'rt gane awa', thou'rt gane awa', Thou'rt gane awa' frae me, Mary.\" Old Song. The public side of Flora's position has been shown ; there was a private side of which necessarily only the poor young woman was cognizant. It was all very"], [216, "196 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" weU to have the stir which was being made about her brought thus before her, and to be touched by it in a wondering, half-gratified, half-affronted way, peculiar to the girl ; but she could not banish from her thoughts all she was leaving behind, and what she had lost by the act which had rendered her famous. In the misty mornings and chill evenings when the daylight had hardly come, or was mostly gone, and the shoals of visitors could be kept at arm's length, when no fine lady had succeeded in inflicting her company on Flora out of lawful hours, she would avoid all farther intercourse with the ship's officers, or with her fellow-prisoners, and would stand by the hour gazing wistfully out of the porthole of her cabin or over the ship's gunwale at the green slopes of Arthur's Seat which, Ukened to a lion couchant though they might be, were no match for the blue mountains of the Hebrides, soaring in serried ranks to heaven. Or she looked at the forest of masts lying between her and the port of Leith, and reflected that some one of them might belong to a packet like The Brothers bound for Inverness and the Highlands ; or she would peer beyond the low-lying island of Inchkeith to where the rock of the Bass should have been visible, if there had been less sea- fog, a brighter dawning or a longer gloaming, and find herself wishing that the old state prison had still been habitable, and in com mon use for women as well as for men. She would have faced the sea-damp, she who had been bred hardily in the humid air of the Long Island, sooner than have been condemned to sail away, out of the Frith of Forth, into the German Ocean \u2014 not to stop till she found herself a travelled lady at the mouth of the Thames, on her road to London. If the English capital was so much larger than Auld Reekie, whose"], [217, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 197 smoke was preventing her from distinguishing tower ing kirk-spire or tall \" land \" of houses, how desolate would a Highland lassie feel in that wilderness of stone and lime, where there would be no brave, generous Lord President to speak a word for her, or, if he interposed on her behalf, the magical thrill of the living voice would be absent, it could only be by the cramped and frozen instrumentality of a quill pen, ink, and paper. Flora had scanty news of all in whom she was deeply concerned. Tidings travelled then with a slowness which it is difficult to understand in days of penny posts, electric wires, and steam transit. But she was aware that poor Kingsbarrow, after his arrest and the brutal treatment which had kept him lying in irons at Fort Augustus, had been transferred to Edinburgh Castle in her near neighbourhood, where he was a disconsolate prisoner still undergoing the hardest of usage. Kingsbarrow's fate was a great weight on Flora's mind. She felt as if she had been guilty of his mis fortunes, though she had only been indirectly con nected with them ; and she had not failed to appeal for him with all a tender woman's wistful wiles, to the much-appealed-to Lord President. On one morning in October the air was heavy with hoar frost passing into a raw drizzling rain, with every prospect of an early and bitter winter. But it is an ill wind which blows nobody good, and Flora, grown weary of the perpetual intrusion of visitors, was flattering herself that few of them would be so keen on their entertainment as to quit their own comfortable hearths and the sheltered shore, to embark on the sullen grey water in order to row to the Bridgewater, on the usual errand. Besides, the"], [218, "198 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" afternoon was the time for such privileged company ; in the morning Flora was generally free to occupy herself with a Uttle needle-work, a Uttle reading, a little letter-writing, and a large instalment of pensive thinking. Suddenly, \"A gentleman to wait on Miss Mac donald,\" was announced, and Flora, a Uttle provoked, and saying to herself, \" Who can be coming at this time of the day?\" rose to find herself face to face with a big handsome young man in a civilian's ordinary riding-coat and long boots. \"Allan Kingsbarrow!\" she cried, with impulsive gladness, for she could do nothing else. \"Where have you sprung from ? \" It was the very household phrase in which she had addressed him on the green before the house of Kingsbarrow, on the wet June morning when they had parted at deadly strife, but the tones of the voice were different. \"Why need you speer, Flora Milton?\" he answered, his heart melting within him. \" You are here and so I am here.\" It was long since she had seen a dear famUiar face \u2014 the dearest of all, from her own Highland country. The accents in which she had spoken were so altered from those he had last heard out of her mouth, so far removed from what he had retained any right to expect or hope to hear, that he took heart of grace from that moment. They sat down and spoke quietly \u2014 of indifferent topics at first, but as old friends would speak together, of Armadale and Monkstadt and MUton. He even told her, while she listened with the greatest interest, of the returns of the harvest and fishing in the Islands that autumn. She asked him abruptly why he was"], [219, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 199 not in his regimentals, and he replied quickly, letting his eyes fall that they might carry no accusation in them as they met hers, that he had left King George's army, he could not stay in the service with his father lying a prisoner in the Castle under the strictest orders, while General Hawley's gallows \u2014 fitly named \" Hawley's shambles \" \u2014 were kept standing in readi ness for political offenders. Then the talk of the two turned on Kingsbarrow, how the patient old man was enduring the hardships inflicted on him, together with anxious consideration of the yet dim and distant prospect of his release, and eager plans for furthering it. It was not till after nearly half an hour's conversa tion that Allan aUuded a little shyly and awkwardly in the beginning, and with gathering passion as he grew more at ease in handling his subject, to his com panion's position. \" And it seems you are a prisoner, too, Flora, kept on board this vessel, till it sail away at the govern ment's pleasure that you may be punished with the other prisoners for contravening the king's wUl.\" \" That is so, Allan,\" she acquiesced composedly. \" And I wUl be doing nothing, nothing in the world to help you.\" He ground his strong white teeth, and his face, with quiet power in its calmness, flushed hotly. She said not a word in answer to the observation, but leant back and twitched at the lace of her bodice. \"You ken, Allan, you did not set me this task,\" she broke the sUence, and her voice was gentle in its hesitation. \" It was none of your proposing and favouring, so why should you interfere to prevent me getting my paiks, when I deserve them \u2014 as the master says when he chastises the bairns in the"], [220, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 200 school. I brought you and yours into the scrape, and that, God knows, is my sorest punishment. As for myself I'm wUling to take my paiks, since I've worked for them,\" she ended with a slight smfle. \" They dare not touch a hair of your head,\" he cried, his voice choking with mingled rage and ruth. \" They will send you back, late or ear', unharmed.\" \"Maybe,\" she agreed pleasantly. \"I only hope they'U not keep me till I'm scomfished with their southern zephyrs.\" \"What I wish to say, what I've come here to-day to say, if you will hear me,\" \u2014 he started to his feet and stood in his manly vigour and earnestness by her chair, \u2014 \"is that I take back every word of whatever I said to offend you. I was mad with jealous anger \u2014 I had no real cause to doubt you, I did not doubt you at the bottom of my heart, but I was whd that you should risk your good name, and my trust and peace, \u2014 your very life, as it sounded, for a lad who, though he was a prince, and come of the old Stuart line, was not worth the venture.\" \" Say no more,\" she interrupted him hastily, \"we have discorded before on these grounds. Oh ! do not let us fall out again,\" she besought him, rising up in her turn and standing before him with clasped hands and streaming eyes, \" when I'm going away I hardly ken where, to meet I cannot tell what reprisals. Do not let us bear the reproach, for the rest of our days, that our last words were still words of cruel taunting wrath, after all this weary time, when we've had space to repent and mend our manners. Let us think better of the weight we'll lay on our hearts and consciences, when you and me, Allan Kingsbarrow, are parted \u2014 how can we say whether for long years, or for ever ? \""], [221, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 201 \"But you take back your words, Flora Milton, as I take back mine,\" he urged, bending over her, laying his hand on her shoulder and pressing it with uncon scious, almost painful force, while he looked in her face with aU his true heart in his beseeching eyes. \"You promise that when we next meet you'U let bygones be bygones.\" \"I promise nothing, sir,\" she broke in upon what he was going to say, speaking with renewed spirit, and freeing herself from his grasp. \"There are words which have been spoken that can never be recalled. They are not like water spUt on the ground, the earth wdl not open to swallow them up. They are lurking in the afr still, and may spring to life again, any day, to rankle, and goad, and breed misery in the far future. Yes, yes, we've forgotten and forgiven, dear AUan, if you wiU. You may have a kiss, if you care to take it, for we part friends for ever more. But though I were to return next year, or not for a score of years, things can never again be between us as they were before I tried you, and your faith failed, and we gave each other the go-by.\" He could get no more out of her \u2014 she would not flinch from her point, and though they parted friends, he went away with a heart, almost as heavy as that which he had brought with him when he came. She went on deck to look over the side, and wave her hand and handkerchief to him as his boat took him back to the pier. While she gazed after him, a rare sweet smile relaxed the firm corners of her mouth, and she told herself, with the echo of a tremulous laugh \u2014 \"Was I going to tell AUan Kingsbarrow my real reason for refusing to renew my promise \u2014 that, if I did, I would consummate his ruin and that of his"], [222, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 202 poor father and family ? The place will be harried enough, I trow, what with confiscations and fines, and fees to lawyers to plead Kingsbarrow's case. And all would be doubled if I made common 'cause with the family, if Allan married me, a notorious rebel in my own person, according to many, while, at the same time, if I were to listen to the world around me, and believe it, I might be tempted to hold that I was rather a fine body, much thought of and held in high esteem. \" But what would my AUan have cared for my real reasons ? I ken him, he would just have strode over them and counted me, my poor self, worth any amount of worldly ruin to himself, or even to his father and mother and little Nanny. He would have borne down all opposition, for he is as determined a chield when his mind is made up, as he is canny for ordinary. \" Better that he should think me hard and dour, for all my talk of forgiveness, without magnanimity and without mercy. Then he will forget me in time, and draw up with some other lass, maybe with a gude tocher \u2014 Kingsbarrow will have great need of it if he should live to cheat the wuddie. Allan and the whole set of them may be happy and prosperous yet. As for me, what matters ? I have done one good deed in my life, else lees are rife, and even my mother has Captain Hugh and her other bairns, and Milton has Lorraine to watch over, and worship, and plague his heart out. Folk make of me, but I'm not so sorely wanted, after all, and there is Heaven waiting for the lonesomest and the weariest of us, when our earthly day is done.\""], [223, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 203 CHAPTER XVII. \" Oh, siccan quarters I was in last nicht ! \" The Gaberlunzie Man. On the 7th of November, 1746, the Bridgewater weighed anchor and safled for the Nore, which was reached without accident, after a fair winter voyage, on the 25th of November. Flora and her servant were transferred to another ship which took them to London docks, and on the 6th of December \u2014 a cold raw day \u2014 they reached their destination. Had the old romantic picturesque fashions been retained, Flora and Kate Macdowal ought to have been put into a wherry, rowed up the Thames, and landed at the Tower, entering by the dolorous Traitor's Gate. But, as Flora had explained to Lorraine, such ancient sombre state and dignity be fitted queens and princesses, and were not for private gentlewomen of comparatively humble degree. Flora and her companion, after marvelling at the forest of shipping they invaded, were landed at the most convenient) quay, put into a hackney coach, conveyed by backways \u2014 the subdued traffic of which was sufficiently astounding to the traveUers, and introduced, by a less-important and a more common place entrance, to the great state prison. Still, simple and almost matter of fact as the arrangements were, there was much in the name, air, and associations of the huge dismal place, especially when encountered under the circumstances, in the gathering gloom of a winter's afternoon in 1746, which caused even Flora's brave heart and serene spirit, conscious of no wrongdoing, to quake and quail."], [224, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 204 It was not more than four months since three noted Scotch gentlemen, my lords Kilmarnock, Balmerino, and Cromartie, were brought here with the sharp edge of the axe which was carried before them turned towards them, in token of their condemnation. Cromartie had received a pardon, but Kilmarnock and Balmerino had suffered on Tower Green, and their blackened heads \u2014 a hideous spectacle \u2014 were still to be seen rotting on the pikes of Temple Bar. \"Flora Macdonald and her personal attendant, a young Highland girl,\" was the designation of the two women in the Warrant of Committal read as soon as they had passed the wicket-gate and portcuUis which admitted them. Then the pah were conducted by one of the soldier guard, along dreary echoing passages, and up and down several flights of ascending and descending mouldy stairs, to the presence of the Governor. Here the spirit of the scene altered somewhat. The room, except that it had an arched doorway and was scantily furnished for its size, was much like other business-rooms. There was a long table littered with papers. In an arm-chair at the head of the table sat a bald-headed gentleman wearing spectacles, and clad in regimentals. There was a secretary at his elbow, and behind them stood an orderly. The gentleman wearing spectacles, seated in the armchair, was no more like a relentless judge than he was like a brutal headsman. In fact, he bore a considerable resemblance to General Campbell, who received Flora on board Captain Fergusson's cutter. If he was stiffer-backed and more formal, his dif ferent nationality might account for it. His bald head, and the spectacles he wore, certainly lent an attribute of mildness to his aspect. He rose, bowed, and caused"], [225, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 205 Flora to be seated before he put the necessary questions to her, the answers to which his secretary took down. Was her name Flora Macdonald ? Had she some time resided at Milton and at Ormiclade, Long Island, and at Monkstadt and Armadale, Skye ? Had she aided and abetted Charles Edward Stuart, commonly known as \" Prince Charles,\" in making his escape from justice, on the 28th, 29th and 30th of June last ? With what assistance had she sup plied him ? Where had she harboured him ? When had she seen him last? Who was in his company when they parted ? Flora's replies were the literal truth while she refused to incriminate her friends. She had gone with Prince Charles to Skye. She was not at liberty to say where she had bestowed him, or in what com pany he was when they parted, but she was ready to volunteer the information that she had acted of her own free will and under no compulsion, and that in taking the Prince to Monkstadt she had proceeded without the authority and without the invitation of Sir Alexander Macdonald and his lady. The Governor, as an Englishman with less know ledge of the circumstances, was not only less frank and friendly than General Campbell had shown him self, he was stUl more embarrassed. A marked ex pression of perplexity and impatience, together with an annoying sense of unfitness and absurdity flitted across his ordinarily impassive face, and struggled with his English shyness, as he said \u2014 \" Now I have done with you, young lady,\" and with a few words in an undertone to the orderly and a distant bow to Flora, turned quickly back to his papers. Flora and her maid followed their conductor"], [226, "206 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" through another labyrinth of passages, at the end of which they were, to their amazement, committed to the care of a portly housekeeper, who displayed more self-importance than had been shown by the Governor. She ushered the prisoners into a little carpeted sitting-room, stuffed with old-fashioned furniture, and having a hot coal fire blazing in the grate. She farther led the way into a bedroom opening from the sitting-room, and this bedroom held an imposing moreen-hung bed, a truckle bed for a servant, chintz -covered chairs, a long mirror, a chest of drawers \u2014 down to a boot-jack, which was not called for on this occasion \u2014 and a copper warming pan, with its burnished handle conspicuously visible protruding from one side of the bed. In short, there were all the requisites of a weU-cared for visitor's rooms. When the housekeeper curtsied and closed the door behind her, Flora broke into a peal of derisive laughter \u2014 a trifle hysterical, but genuine laughter nevertheless \u2014 as she looked around her, the reaUty was so different from the anticipation, the anti cUmax was so great. \" This the Tower ! Not possible,\" she cried, with Kate standing open-mouthed, under her tartan screen, for her sole audience. \" This is a fell-like dungeon, and I do not doubt the bread and water will be of a corresponding quality. What would my cousin Lor raine say ? What would we not have given \u2014 me and a greater than me \u2014 when we were wandering forlorn in the wilds, to have known of quarters like this to be received in. What would they say to these lodgings at Armadale or at Kingsbarrow ? \" \"Well, and indeed, Flora daughter of Ranald,\" answered Kate in her mother tongue, staring round"], [227, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 207 her in sincere admiration, \" there will not be a room like this full of fine things \u2014 not in Kingsbarrow \u2014 no, not in Armadale. It would take Mugstatt * to come near to them. Is it that instead of locking you up they are going to make a great lady of you, like Lady Marget ? \" \"But we are locked up,\" said Flora, sobering down from her feeling of diversion. \" Though I can see for myself it's in some private house belonging to one of the gentlemen jaUors, and not in the grim Tower itself.\" For eight days Flora and Kate fared, as they reckoned, sumptuously, without being again brought up before an authority, without getting any intima tion whether Flora would be sent for trial, or what in all probability would be her ultimate destination. They were without visitors \u2014 a great change in itself, but they had a small variety in their daily lives, in the shape of exercise provided for them. Their need in this respect was thought of and secured to them. They were taken out to a walled kitchen and flower garden within the precincts, and were permitted to walk up and down the box-edged walks for an hour at a time. It aU seemed to Flora a foolish travesty and burlesque of imprisonment in such a region. Yet though she had laughed and mocked at it at first, even in eight days its irksomeness, idleness, and relegation to pining solitude, relieved only by the simple companionship of Kate Macdowal, soon struck her as a hard experience to fall to the lot of a woman of her nature. Hardship and persecution she could have borne as well as most women or men ; but this half-contemptuous neglect, this abandonment of her, * Monkstadt."], [228, "208 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" as it appeared, to what was, in her eyes, enervating southern luxury and scornful oblivion, unbraced her energies and depressed her spirits. The sheltered Tower garden was lying in its winter rest, but it was not such a rest as Flora was accustomed to. There were evergreen bushes, and budding boughs, and stragghng primroses in warm corners. She looked without pleasure at them. \" You mind, Kate,\" she said, \" what a howling wilderness even Sleat, even my mother's garden at Armadale wiU be now, and the garden at Milton, it is like, will be lying under a winding sheet of snow. But, oh, to be walking there, though our feet were frozen and our fingers sleeping !* 44 4 Oh for a breath of the Norlan' wind To blaw the reek frae me.' Not the reek of London town, but the soft smothering warmth of this English country.\" \"And it is a very pretty country and a very big town, whatever, Miss Macdonald, the little we have seen of it,\" replied the only half-comprehending Kate. \"And it must be fine not to have the black frost and the sneU winds for six months on end. Still, no doubt, there is a great odds dandering in this shut-in place for nothing, and tramping across the open moor on our proper business. No, I'm not just sure that I would niffer our rough moors and roaring sounds and lochs, for their lighted streets and smooth roads.\" The penance did not last long. Flora found herself, with little preparation and no choice given her, transferred along with Kate, in a close coach, with a Tower guard, to the custody of a private * Benumbed."], [229, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 209 family, residing at no great distance somewhere in the vicinity of Trinity Square. The family were sound Whigs, as Flora heard without any objection, friends of Mr. Pelham the minister, and they had consented to be answerable for her appearance when called for. The difference between the quarters assigned to her might not seem very great, but it pointed to leniency in the government's final dealing with her misdemeanour. Besides, to be even a compulsory guest in a private family, whose occupations and interests she might in a measure share, in whose company she would sit at meals, with whom she could be civilly social, nay friendly, as she had been with the Campbells at Dunstaffnage, and the Commodore and officers of the Bridgewater, was decidedly preferable to solitary confinement in the eyes of a large-minded, large-hearted, kindly-tempered woman. The family who had not shrunk from the onerous task imposed upon them, had doubtless, like the Governor of Dunstaffnage and his lady, thought to see in Flora a wUd woman of the North, a fanatical, impracticable Jacobite, who would keep them in con stant commotion and alarm. They, too, must have been agreeably surprised to discover a pleasant mannered, well-instructed young woman, with a temper whose sensible docility and brave cheerfulness won golden opinions from all who came in contact with her. The heads of the household were a middle-aged gentleman, who held a post under government, and his young wife, whom he had lately wedded and brought from her home in the country. To madam, when a little familiarity had broken down the dread p"], [230, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 210 with which she had regarded the strange guest thrust upon her, Flora Macdonald was a perfect God-send. The simple-natured bride who could honour and obey her mature mate, while she did not dream of asking sympathy from him, had been burning to display her marriage finery to an intelligent spectatress. She was pleased to prattle \u2014 not only of the deUghts of town life and of the entertainments given by her husband's friends, in honour of his bride, but of all the associations she had recently left behind her \u2014 her father and mother, brothers and sisters, in then- Norfolk manor house ; the hunting breakfasts in which she had taken part ; the fairs she had at tended in order to see old women grinning out of horse-collars ; the shell-work which a fine lady from London had taught her because it was all the fashion, and she had attained to such proficiency that she had made a frame for the Adam and Eve picture in the oak parlour, and it was acknowledged by everybody to be \" mighty fine.\" Above all, she liked to expatiate on the number of ladies and gentlemen who had ridden with her and Mr. Marwick to church to see them \" wed.\" Flora was a good listener, she could give her attention to the lively chatterer, even with her own fortunes hanging in the balance. She could compare notes with the youthful matron, who was also one of her jailors, from what Flora herself had known of brilliant Edinburgh assemblies and witty Edinburgh tea-parties, and of such hunting expeditions as her hostess's naive imagination hardly sufficed to compass. As for Flora's host, who was her jailor-in-chief, he would withdraw his attention from some blue-book of the day, or other edifying study, to notice how animated and happy his young wife looked in the"], [231, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 211 act of complying with his recommendation to do her best to be agreeable to the young Scotch lady billeted upon them. He also not only forgave the intruder on his domestic privacy, he was disposed to take a milder view of her offence and its deserts. One morning Flora was sitting by herself in her hostess's parlour, practising the accomplishment of \" knotting,\" which madam had been pleased to teach her with much self-importance and elaboration of instruction, when the lady of the house darted into the room, in the highest excitement. The ribands of her mob cap were all in a flutter. The folds of her muslin neckerchief had burst from the pearl brooch which confined them, her muslin apron was dragged on one side, the high heels of her little shoes pattered and clattered incoherently on the polished boards. \" Oh ! Lud ! Miss Mackdonal, what shall we do?\" cried the agitated lady; \"Mr. Marwick has gone abroad, and there is a gilt coach with outriders at the door. Mrs. Brett the housekeeper says these are the royal liveries, she has been all her life in Lon'on, and has seen them in the parks. But she cannot tell me how to behave, for she has not been to court any more than I have, though Mr. Marwick is to have me presented at one of the drawing-rooms in the spring. But I'll disgrace myself now, I'm main certain, and, oh, what will Mr. Marwick say ?\" \" Be calm, my dear madam, be calm, be your own self. I'm sure you could not be anybody better,\" was Flora's reassuring advice. \" Stand up, don't turn your back, curtesy low and wait for the company to tell their errand.\" The words were scarcely out of Flora's mouth when a tall, fair-haired man, nearer forty than thirty years of age, walked \u2014 without waiting to be announced \u2014"], [232, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 212 looking as if all belonged to him, into the room, followed by several other gentlemen. The leader wore a hunting-coat trimmed with gold lace, light knee breeches, and silk stockings, with glittering buckles at his knees and at the instep of his low-cut shoes. He had the grace to remove his three-cornered hat on entering the room, so that it could be seen that he wore his own fair hair carefully arranged in curls, curling back from his face and tied with a riband behind. The face would have been handsome in its effeminacy, but for the weakness of the chin, the sneer on the thin lips, the bold, brazen stare of an empty-headed, cold-hearted profligate's eyes. \" Be seated, ladies, be seated,\" the Prince of Wales waved his hand jauntily to the occupants of the room, offering one of those cheap bids for popularity with which he alternated his reckless insolence. With the barest contemptuous acknow ledgment of poor little Madame Marwick's trem blingly profound curtsy, he turned with rude abruptness to Flora. \"Are you that rebel Mistress Flora Macdonald ? \u2014 Gad ! she does not look anything of the amazon in stature and frame-work ! \" \u2014 in a loud impertinent aside to his companions. \" Madam, I wish to ask how you dared assist a pretender to the rank and title of Prince of Wales, which are mine by the Act of Succession ? \" Flora did not flinch ; she, too, had made her deep obeisance to her interrogator, whUe her bright blue eyes scanned him with fearless interest, and took in his every lineament. \" I would have done the same for your Royal Highness, if I had found you in a like strait,\" she said, with quiet composure. \"Do you hear her, Doddington?\" Frederick,"], [233, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 213 Prince of Wales, appealed to one of his satellites. \"Ain't that an offer of allegiance, rather late in the day and rather barefaced under the circumstances, perhaps. Well, mistress, I am glad to have made the acquaintance of so doughty and notorious an enemy, willing to become a friend when time serves, it seems.\" He departed with as little ceremony as he had come. When the master of the house heard of the visit, he was roused to indignation. \" The royal scamp ! \" he cried, departing from his official reticence, \"he makes mischief wherever he goes. It is little he cares for the interests of the king his father, or the welfare of the kingdom, unless when he thinks his own prerogatives are invaded. He is the greatest thorn in his Majesty's side as he was in that of the late Queen. He shall not come here again, Betty, or I wUl hear more on't. You did well, Miss Macdonald, to hold him at arm's length, and crave no favour at his hands.\" \"I think, sir,\" said Flora, with a gleam of her dry humour, \"that if I were reduced to a choice between their two Royal Highnesses, I ;would prefer him whom people call my prince to the other \u2014 not that there is not something of a family likeness,\" she admitted sorrowfully, \"which years may bring out more clearly. It may exist between all princes, for aught I can tell, so that it is well there are weightier considerations than the merits of mere mortal men, to back up their claims.\" \"You are right there, mistress,\" said Mr. Marwick, with settled conviction. \" It is not the men or even the measures they are the authors of, it is the principles involved, and the good of the country which are at stake.\""], [234, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 214 CHAPTER XVIII. 44 Give her of the fruit of her hands ; and let her own works praise her in the gates.\" \u2014 Proverbs. The season wore on tiU the March winds swayed the sweUing boughs of the trees, and tossed the fragrant daffodils in the Tower Garden, while away in the Long Island and in Skye \u2014 white and grey tints, as in the aspect of death itself, still prevailed over the whole face of nature. Then Flora sickened at the particulars which she gathered, partly from the news-prints she was aUowed to see, partly from the conversation she heard around her, of the traitor's death of old Lord Lovat upon the Tower Green yonder. She knew he was doubly a traitor, ready to betray each cause when it suited him, and that he was caught in his own toils. She was aware he had been a bad husband and a bad kinsman. She could not mourn for him as for an honest man. But he was her countryman, paying the last penalty of the law, and she had seen and been spoken to by him in Inverness, in former days, when the name of Simon Fraser was, as far as territorial power went, a name to conjure by. It was the last great heading after the \" 45.\" The law and majesty of the Protestant succession were appeased. Summer and the Act of Indemnity were at the door. The Act was passed in June 1747. It brought Flora an official letter with a great red seal, telling her that she was free to return to Scotland. It carried to many a poor prisoner in harder case, with gloomier doubts of the result of his captivity, to Kingsbarrow in Edinburgh Castle, to Malcolm"], [235, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 215 Macleod who had come up downhearted to be hanged in London, to hundreds of unhappy wights at Glasgow, Carlisle, York, an assurance of safety and deliverance. Flora did not immediately avail herself of the permission granted to her. If she did not go so far as the Apostle Paul when he sent the bold challenge to the magistrates of Philippi \u2014 that, having cast him and Silas into prison, without just cause, they should not thrust them out privily (\"nay verily, but let them come themselves and fetch us \"), she would not flee like a culprit to whom grace had been granted, who is ashamed to show her face. She would accept the invitation of the great Jacobite Lady Primrose \u2014 desperate enthusiast as tbe poor bereft lady was \u2014 who was prepared to come in her coach and carry Flora as an honoured guest to Lady Primrose's house in Essex Street, Strand. Flora would go with her eager patroness \u2014 why not? She had done nothing out of the common, as she had done nothing wrong, according to her constant assertion ; but she was certainly entitled to the gratitude of the Prince and his friends, and to such indemnifications, for all the annoyance and inconvenience she had suffered, as they could procure for her. For example, a journey from London to the North of Scotland was in those days a serious and costly matter, requiring some consideration with regard to the means and the mode, before putting it into execution. Flora parted from the Marwicks with mingled congratulations and regrets \u2014 the regrets greatly pre ponderating in young madam's case. Flora found the Jacobites' heads a little turned by the Act of Indemnity. For the time the party no longer shrank from coming forward and asserting"], [236, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 216 themselves, whUe they kept within the limits of rebellion. She could have had a hundred temporary homes, where one sufficed her, pressed on her acceptance. Withal, Flora was not without a consciousness of the possibility of political misconception, and of masquerading under false colours. For was she not by aU her antecedents a Whig rather than a Tory, and had she not served Prince Charles for friendship, and humanity's sake, and not in the light of her duty to her future sovereign? Her consolation was that she had never disguised her sentiments, and that no question of her motives could alter the fact of her service to the Prince. On the other hand, though Flora in her simplicity and generosity never ceased to wonder at the world's making so much of the quite natural and ordinary deed she had done, when she saw how it was regarded by the world she began to take an innocent pride in her achievement. And she must always feel a wistful womanly interest in the high-born lad whose life she had done something to save. She rejoiced with all her heart and soul when the news was first whispered, and then confirmed, that, so far back as the month of September, in the previous year, he had indeed escaped from the very district of Moidart in which he had first landed and planted his standard. A foreign privateer, chartered by his adherents, had succeeded in approaching the coast and taking him off. He had long ago touched French land. His wanderings and hardships were over. He was once more in the midst of ancient allies, royal kindred, and faithful retainers. It was enough for the Jacobites, rising jubilant from the hushed tempest which had beaten them low, to"], [237, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 217 know that Flora Macdonald had rescued their Prince \u2014 the loadstone which was yet to draw all hearts, the sun that was to rise again above the horizon, at no distant date, and transform defeat into victory. The lady who came forward and asserted success fuUy that it was her privilege to receive the young Highland girl then liberated from durance, was a prominent tragic figure among the Jacobites in London. The name of Lady Primrose of Dunipace was familiar in Jacobite annals for years to come. Little more than six months before, about the date that the Bridgewater had sailed from Leith roads, Sir Archibald Primrose of Dunipace was executed at CarUsle for his share in the rebellion. Surely on that bitter day tears of blood were wrung from his mother's heart; but she had turned resolutely for strength to fervent advocacy of the high Tory creed, and the exiled family for whose sake her son had perished. The spirit of a Roman matron was in the erect gait, bloodless cheeks, closely compressed lips, eyes glowing like fire in the pale worn face of this woman, in her mourning weeds. It was not so much revenge she craved for a wrong which once done could not be undone, as tangible proof that it had not been suffered in vain. She was willing to die, in her turn, in order to bring back the Stuarts for whose home-coming Archibald Primrose had died. Not Lorraine, in her youthful frenzy of enthusiasm, was more absorbed in the fortunes of the Prince and his house, and more severely dedicated to their revival and triumph at the eleventh hour, than was this middle-aged woman with her experience of life and death, with her best days gone, and the staff of her declining years broken in her hand. Lady Primrose could not be said to be a genial or"], [238, "218 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" sympathetic hostess for Flora \u2014 indeed the bereaved woman had not a thought to spare from the one object of her existence. Her house in Essex Street was the rallying ground and rendezvous of the Jacobites to the end of her life. It was especially so of those who were stUl active in plots and schemes for the disturbance of the public peace and the overthrow of the reigning house. No conspirator among them was more engrossed with his machinations, more occupied with mysterious messages and secret com munications for which he had always to be on the alert, than was the poor lady whose house was desolate and her arms empty, who went about with the abstraction and indifference of a sleep-walker. But though Lady Primrose could not figure as a cheerful disengaged hostess, nothing could exceed her unaffected condescension and substantial kindness, as Flora saw them, in a woman of this chUdless widow's rank, years, sorrows and cares, towards the Highland girl whom she desired to benefit. Lady Primrose was not alone in this idea. The whole of the Jacobites, in or near the metropolis, presented themselves, as the elite of Edinburgh had flocked before them, to see the nonsuch, the heroine, to thank and praise and if possible to reward her, in return for what they owed her. \" Am I to be a gazing-stock for ever, and for such a little thing?\" cried poor Flora in her native modesty, hah in dismay, half with her ever-present sense of humour, which tickled her on the most serious occasions, as Kate Macdowal rushed up from the servants' hall one fine day, to acquaint her mistress with the alarming fact that there were no fewer than \" eighteen glass coaches,\" full of fine company, come to wait upon her, ranged in the"], [239, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 219 street, a spectacle to the passers-by. \"They'll get into trouble, or they'll get my lady into trouble, coming in such force to look at me,\" cried Flora, with rnirth-tinged vexation. \"Muckle these great folk will see for their pains ! What am I to wear ? How am I to look ? For if they seek to do me honour, I'm bound to do them honour. There is a fell disap pointment awaiting the company, I will be thinking. I w?ish I were back in Skye, or in the Long Island, wearing my home-spun, and taking my turn at the big wheel. (Oh ! Kate, it would be so much better and happier.) If only my cousin Lorraine were here to represent me for the time ! Did you say you were furnished with a list of names to hurry my hands and my feet, by showing me what grace is done to me ? Oh ! they're very grand names, Kate, far beyond you and me. There are those of marquises and earls, and among Scotch names there is that of Kelly and of my Lady Cromartie whose lord's head was weU-nigh under the axe a year syne.\" Sure enough whoever among the Jacobite nobility and gentry faUed to appear, not a Jacobite Scotchman or woman, within a day's distance, was not there. \" The Macdonald Lass \" was a proud feather in the national cap. The questions were in everybody's mouth, \" Have you been to wait on Miss Flora Macdonald?\" \"Hey, what is your candid opinion of the brave Macdonald lass from the far Hebrides ? She is not an unbroken colt, or an untrained countri fied rustic. Not a bit of it. She's as trig, and as snod, and as wiselike, with as pretty manners, as if she had never rowed a boat, or ridden an un groomed pony, or stepped outside her mother's door without a waiting gentlewoman by her side.\" To see and speak with Flora Macdonald was worth"], [240, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 220 a long ride and what risk remained to the \"assoilzied\" rebels. All the Scotch residents in London this summer were not strangers to Flora. There had been some talk of Clanranald and his lady being summoned from Benbecula to answer for their doings, before the Act of Indemnity was passed, but the requirement had not taken effect. It was Lady Marget who came up, at her discretion, whom her friend had the pleasure of greeting. It was not unmixed pleasure, for Sir Alexander, Flora's chief, the father of his clan, had died at the close of the year. Lady Marget, in her widowhood, had the burden and responsibility of acting for her young sons, hardly out of the nursery. She came up to town for two reasons : she was anxious to secure betimes an English governor for Uttle Sh James, and to make arrangements for his going, as soon as might be, to be educated with aU the polish of an English gentle man at Eton and Oxford. She wished also, and here her conscience pricked her for past indiscretions, to make her peace, in the interests of her children, with the government and court, by seizing the opportunity to attend, in her deep mourning, one of the Princess of Wales's drawing-rooms. Flora saw Lady Marget after this ceremony, and found her burning to tell the scurvy treatment she had received, and the spirit in which she had dealt with the treatment. Augusta, Princess of Wales, was the stiffest and most stupid of worthy women and ambitious prin cesses. She was without a particle of the late Queen Caroline's tact, just as she was destitute of her mother in-law's pungent wit, and she had not stopped short at flouting the proud daughter of the Montgomeries."], [241, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 221 \" The Princess is a common-looking woman,\" said Lady Marget with asperity, \" she's scantily well favoured \u2014 for all her jewelled orders. What right has she to look majestic and beautiful \u2014 the gawky daughter of ' a wee wee German lairdie ' \u2014 far re moved even from our late Queens, Anne and Mary ? As for our banished Queen, Mary of Modena, I would not have insulted her by the comparison. And if you will believe me, Flora Milton, the Princess insulted me to my very face. She said, in her cold, sour way, turning to one of her ladies whilst I was still within healing, she could have wished she had made my acquaintance before I had a hand in the escape of the Pretender, as if poor Sir Alexander had not been a friend to the Government, as if I was a person to scunner at, Flora, as if my Prince \u2014 God save him, where he is in safety, thanks to you \u2014 were dirt beneath her feet, the very contact with which would defile her. But I round and gave her as good as she gave me, Princess of Wales though she pretended to be. Pretender, indeed ! I wonder who is the most barefaced pretender, Prince Charles, or the fellow from Hanover, simpering like any petit maltre at her back. I turned and faced her, and 'the Eglintoun air ' was not wanting you may be certain. ' Madam,' I said, ' I can aver with perfect truth, I never set eyes on the unfortunate gentleman you allude to,' \u2014 I have you to thank, Flora, for being able to give her that assurance, which helped to keep Sir Alexander clear of being art and part in the business. 'But,' said I farther, 'if it had rested with your Royal Highness to give a beaten man one chance more, I trust you would have remembered that mercy always sets (becomes) the victor. Forby, the van quished man was in this case a Scotch cousin of his"], [242, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 222 Majesty's.' I gave her up her foot there, the grudging spiteful upstart of a usurper ! She's worse than auld Geordie, who, they tell me, when his mind is made up to pardon, bears no malice in the time to come.\" Flora would fain have gone home with Lady Marget, save that she durst not even yet associate herself conspicuously with the widow of her chief, and that she, Flora, was detained a little longer, to receive a fresh mark of respect and gratitude from the Jacobites. This took the form of a subscription, the list headed by Lady Primrose, to defray her expenses and refund some of the losses which she and her immediate friends had sustained. At first Flora was incUned to refuse the offering \u2014 she had done little and that little did not call for payment. But on second thoughts, she saw the proposal in a different light. She was a thoroughly honest woman, and she had no more false pride and false shame than she had inordinate vanity and conceit. She had the sorrowful knowledge that her step-father and brother had been put to expense, in securing aid and advice which were never called for, which they could ill afford, on her account. She also knew that Kingsbarrow, in spite of all Lady Marget, in the minority of her son, would have will ingly had done for him, was practically a ruined man. If anybody was entitled to make good these injuries received in sheltering and befriending Charles Edward Stuart, it was the faction which held him to be their lawful prince. Therefore Flora accepted thankfully, and without scruple in the end, the sum of fifteen hundred pounds subscribed on her behalf. It was secured on the estate of little Sir James of Monkstadt, before it was given into the hands of Mr. Clerk, merchant, from whom it was eventually sent in two bills, which passed through the hands"], [243, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 223 of Flora's old friend, Mr. Mackenzie of Delvin, Writer to the Signet in Edinburgh, and at last reached the proper recipient. There was an additional compliment about which there was such a clamour that Flora could not avoid accepting it also. She must have her picture taken ; her likeness must be preserved to show to other generations, perhap \u2014 who knew ? \u2014 when the Stuarts were restored to their seat on the throne of the United Kingdom. \" Me have my picture painted ! \" cried Flora in fresh incredulity and scorn. \" It would not be worth a painter's pains. If it had been my bonnie cousin Lorraine now, she might have pleased his eye, been worthy of his brush, and merited living on canvas. But me, with my high cheek-bones, my big mouth, and my barn-door complexion. Hout tout ! it would be clean wastry, and no true Scotchman or woman can abide wastry.\" But when Flora found that she would cause morti fication and disappointment to her zealous admirers, by her persistent refusal, she yielded to this suggestion likewise, as graciously as she could manage it. She was to have her choice of the painter, and she did not hesitate when she found that Allan Ramsay, the younger, was one of the competitors for the com mission, without regard to his prospects as future court painter. He was less \" canny\" than his father, and he knew better how the wind of popularity blew, \u25a0which would fill his sails as an artist. He could guess what crowds would come to his studio to see the picture of the Scotch heroine. In addition to everything, he was a Scotchman himself, and, though he had settled in England, he liked Scotland to come to the front."], [244, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 224 When his name was mentioned to Flora she seized upon it at once. \" Indeed and indeed, let it be his father's son, and we'll have a fine crack about ' Habbie's How,' and ' Within a mile of Edinburgh Town,' and of the shops with the sign of the Mercury, and of the poets' heads opposite the Cross Well, and the Cross itself.\" Allan the painter was not unwilling to speak of Allan the poet. He was less disposed to dwell on the shops, seeing that he was a man of rising gentility, as well as of professional success. His first wife, the sister of the Edinburgh professor, was dead, and he was courting a second in a high quarter. He aspired to nothing less than Lady Stormont's daughter, the great Lord Mansfield's niece. \"And wUl you be drawn in character, Miss Mac donald,\" asked the enterprising artist, who had some thing of his mother's comeliness, along with his father's swarthiness. \" In character ? \" echoed Flora, a little bewildered. \" Do you mean cowering in the tempest-tossed boat, or riding or tramping, wet and weary, across the sodden moors ? \" \" Oh no, that was not my meaning,\" explained the smiling painter. \"I only intended to hear your wishes with respect to any show of your native tartan.\" \" Tartan ! Oh, by aU means,\" answered Flora, with due gravity. \" I'm not ashamed ; I'm very proud of the tartan.\" \" And we might have a white rose in your hair and in your bosom.\" \" I'm not so sure of that,\" said Flora, doubtfully ; \" the white rose is for Lorraine Kilmossie, not for me. Yet what for not ? There's no more to object to in"], [245, "\"THE .MACDONALD LASS.\" 225 the rose than in the winding-sheet I'm destined to wear. The white rose perished as a political badge at Culloden. It will never again be worn in Scotland, as a symbol of the Royal Stuart's cause. I served him as well as any Highland Jacobite of them all could have done, and he counted me his very good friend, so I will wear the white rose, for once, in token of my princely friend. It will please them here, and there will be no harm done.\" Thus Flora was painted, as she remains in her picture, with her tartan screen drawn half round her, and white roses in her flowing hair and in her bosom. , CHAPTER XIX. 44 The fire that's blawn on Beltane e'en May weel grow cauld gin Yule.\" Old Song. The last of the gifts showered on Flora was a Royal Stuart tartan sUk gown, given to her by an enthusi astic Jacobite lady, on condition that Flora should wear it on her wedding day. \"What for not?\" repeated Flora, with the shade of hardness which was stealing into her voice and face, in the midst of all the honours heaped upon her, \"that is if I ever wed, which is more than doubtful. I'm free to wear the Stuart livery since I did one of the name a good turn. It is a fine strong silk, and the set of the tartan is bonnie, though it is a thought bright and bold for a bride's wear, unless, to be sure, she be come to mature years \u2014 when she may carry it off. I'm fain to confess that I do not like it so well as our own Macdonald set, which is dusky, like the Q"], [246, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 226 heather. But the red silk will last longer than a white dud, and be more befitting should the bride be up in years. My mother was a bit lassie of sixteen when she was married to my young father.\" Yet more acceptable was the thoughtful offer of the hire of a post-chaise and pair to take Flora, her maid, and any other travelling companions she might choose, back to Scotland. Flora immediately named Malcolm Macleod of Raasay, who was wont to say thenceforth, in half shamefaced allusion to his previous panic, that \" he had gone up to London to be hanged, and come down in a grand chaise with Miss Flora Macdonald.\" Her useful kinsman and serving man, Niel Mac- Eachan, also started up, to be in attendance on her. Niel had nothing to fear after the passing of the Act of Indemnity. He appeared on the scene openly, and welcomed the opportunity of seeing his friends in Scotland again, before he retired to France, to claim what tardy recompense he could secure from the Prince and his party. And what little counte nance was left for Charles Stuart to afford did reach MacEachan in the shape of a lieutenant's commission in Ogilvy's regiment of the Scotch brigade, in the service of France. It was early autumn before the chaise started with its freight, and more than a year since Flora had been arrested by Captain Fergusson, on her way to her mother's house of Armadale. The chaise conveyed the triumphant little party by the usual stages as far as Edinburgh, where Flora took a week's rest among the friends who hastened to congratulate her \u2014 not the slowest in presenting themselves being Allan the poet, and the Lord Presi dent of the Court of Session."], [247, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 227 Another long journey had to be faced ere the winter set in, and the snow blocked such roads as existed, before the feats of General Wade, between Edinburgh and Inverness. At Inverness there was another halt and another gathering of jubilant friends. The only mode of travelling from Inverness to the Hebrides was on horseback and by ferry-boats, while the passes were still open, and the autumn winds were not lashing the Minch into its wildest fury. But what cared Flora for frost-bitten heather, and the wrack on the sea, when she could again gaze her fill on the grand grey mountains and the wild brown moors, and feel the fresh wind, salt-flavoured from the Atlantic, reddening her cheeks and ruffling her hah ? Captain Hugh of Armadale had saddled ponies and gillies, waiting at Inverness, to bring Flora home, and before she had reached the last mile of that home-coming for which she had so longed, her fingers were blistered and bleeding from continually holding her bridle-reins and pressing forward her willing pony. No more terrified reproaches and weeping lamen tations from her mother, no more outspoken blame from Milton. Praise, thanks, and rejoicing, the fatted calf killed for one who was no prodigal, but the champion and deliverer of those in trouble, with music and dancing on every side, as she hastened to report herself at Monkstadt, Kingsbarrow, and Ormiclade. Only Lorraine Macdonald's fair pale face was pinched with care and sorrow, until she looked as if she were fading away in her youth and beauty. She took Flora sternly to task for one part of her conduct. \"To receive siller for what you were honoured by"], [248, "228 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" being permitted to do, to be paid for the service I would have given my life to discharge ! Oh, Flora ! how could you take the gold ? I'm black affronted for you, if you're not affronted for yourself. It strips your deed of all its splendour. It is not far removed in baseness from accepting blood-money, for the delivering up of an enemy.\" \" Grant me patience ! \" cried Flora, restraining her justifiable anger. \" Lorraine, you're but a fooUsh young lassie, or else I might not pardon your ill considered words, and you and me might never be friends again. Do you ken I've been the means, sorely against my will, of putting my stepfather and my brother to heavy costs which they can ill afford, which would be hard for them to meet, unless I came forward and freed them from a portion of the burden. Do you ken the crops have been a failure this harvest, and the price of black cattle has gone down ? Do you ken \u2014 you can see for yourself, an you will, that Kingsbarrow has come out of Edinburgh Castle a broken-down auld man, as laden with debt as they ever had the heart to load him with irons ? Do you ken it will take every penny Allan Kingsbarrow can make, as the tacksman of Flodigarry, the farm Sh James's tutors have put into his hands, to back up his father, and that Mrs. Macdonald and little Nanny are mainly dependent on his exertions ? It is you who should be mortally ashamed, Lorraine Kilmossie, of grudging me and my kindred and friends the small propine which was fairly earned, in order to stave off the ruin that is not far from our doors.\" There was another person who stood aloof, another aggrieved and discontented spirit, in the middle of the general satisfaction and gratitude. That other was young Allan Kingsbarrow. It was not that he"], [249, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 229 any longer doubted or disapproved of Flora, on the contrary, she was now far too good for him. The Celtic imagination is ardent and lively, even when he who imagines is a person of ordinarily calm temper and sober judgment. It was not enough that Flora had come back safe and sound, rewarded, and not punished, for her humanity and heroism, still greater promotion must await her. She had made powerful friends in the South, apart from the Prince she had aided. She was going to be as fine a lady as any of them. No doubt this view of the case was unconsciously helped by the extravagant estimation of the situation taken by the poor of the clan who were in ecstasies over \" Flora, daughter of Ranald's \" exaltation. These ecstasies had their origin, to some extent, in Kate Macdowal's wildly poetical version of the honours which had been heaped on her and her mistress, during then stay in London town. How could Allan Kingsbarrow take it upon him to approach her, when he knew full well how poor and miserable his fortune had grown, how heavhy he was hampered both in the present and the future ? The couple had parted friends on board the Bridge water, but even there she had told him she could not forget the words which he had spoken, or the insult ing doubt he had cast on her innocence and high mindedness. How could he ask her again to forget and forgive when he had less than nothing to offer her in return ? When his motives must of necessity be open to humiliating suspicion ? Poor Allan was guiltless of the cupidity some times attributed to his race. Accordingly, he hung back gloomily \u2014 as it might have appeared to those who knew no better, sullenly \u2014 from any attempt at"], [250, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 230 renewing his suit, in spite of the fact that Lady Marget, who was cognizant of what had been between the pair, tried more in good-nature than in prudence, with her natural love of management, to bring them together again. But if the old saying is true that \" when a woman is willing a man can but look like a fool,\" stUl more is it evident that if a man is unwilling, under whatever morbid misconception, a woman who respects herself can do little else save follow his example, and stand aloof \u2014 even while she looks back, wistfully, at the gulph which has sprung up between the two, once so near. Flora was not likely to do anything else. She could not altogether blame the defaulter, she had too much sympathy with his scruples \u2014 for which he had ample reason of an honest and honourable kind. But in her own pain and disappointment she was tempted to overact her part. The additional dignity which she threw into her bearing towards Allan, might be easily mistaken \u2014 not merely for unflinching deter mination, but for a shade of disdain. Affairs were farther complicated by Flora's strenu ous efforts to get old Kingsbarrow to take from her, as a loan, a share of the money lying in her name in London. It was hers to do with as she thought fit, and neither Captain Hugh nor Milton would find fault with this disposal of part of it. It was Allan who stood in the way \u2014 she might have persuaded Kingsbarrow to become her debtor, she could not persuade Allan. The harder she tried to make the compensation for the injury she had unwittingly done the family, by bringing the Prince to Skye, the more dourly Allan Kingsbarrow con trived to parry the attempt, and this Flora found a real ground of offence committed against her."], [251, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 231 Thus matters stood when they were very nearly cleared up summarily. Flora, who had sustained, with great credit to her Highland nurture, the long strain on her bodily and mental physique, when the pressure was removed, in the middle of the festivities, unexpectedly broke down. She lay at Monkstadt so utterly shaken, reduced in strength, and seriously ill, that Lady Marget, in consternation, refused to depend on the medical skill of the island, and sent expressly to the mainland to fetch an Inverary doctor to her friend. \" Bl news travels fast,\" and the intimation of a threatened calamity, in this quarter, all but broke down Allan Kingsbarrow's attitude of dogged estrange ment. The report that Flora was lying at death's door, arrived at Flodigarry late one night, and early next morning Allan had changed his coat, and was in his boat ready to row round to Monkstadt, to throw his pride to the winds, cast himself on the mercy of Lady Marget, and make peace with \" Fionnighail \" on any terms. Then a shepherd or cailag dropped in with the farther tidings that Flora Milton was a great deal better, that she was able to sit up in her room, and that the Inverary doctor said she only wanted a little rest to be as well as ever. Allan laid down his oars, turned back to his house, resumed his old coat, and started straightway with his gun for the moors, to show his thankfulness by looking after his stirks and stots, and shooting what game he could find."], [252, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 232 CHAPTER XX. \u2022' Wot ye wha's in yon toon ? \" Jacobite Song. In the course of the next eighteen months the dis turbed state of the Highlands underwent a marked modification, martial law gave place to the ordinary course of justice. A faint return of national prosperity in the track of peace, began to dawn on the racked and harried districts, and hope sprang up afresh in the hearts of the younger generation. Flora took a notable step in the circumstance ; as if she were no longer contented with occasional visits to Glasgow and Edinburgh, she agreed to see London a second time, in the company of Lady Marget Macdonald, who went south again in the interests of her children. The widowed grande dame was more solicitous than ever for the company of the wise, helpful young woman friend, in whose training her ladyship was pleased to think she had been instrumental, who knew the affairs of Monkstadt almost as well as its mistress knew them, and was nearly as keenly concerned for the welfare of little Sir James and his brothers as their mother was. Flora herself, conscious of a certain dissatisfied rest lessness, was willing enough to revisit London, under altered conditions, and to renew her acquaintance with the friends it had been her good fortune to make in her adversity. AUan Kingsbarrow let her go without making any sign, unless it could be con sidered a sign that, though the last lambing season had been exceptionally fine, and prices for cattle appeared to be rising, he was looking glummer than ever. Flora Milton was free to do as she liked; if she"], [253, "\"THE jMACDONALD L.-ISS7 233 preferred new friends, soft words, and dainty living to old friends in their sincerity and fidelity, and Highland fare in its wholesome plainness and sim plicity, she was welcome. She might go to France, for her old lover ; and, when he came to think of it, this returning to England to abide, or not to abide there, might be the crucial test as to where her heart lay. Lady Marget and Flora spent the spring and summer of 1750 in London, lodging at a genteel house worthy of Lady Marget's quaUty, in the region of Pall Mall. In these favourable circumstances Flora saw all the sights, and became acquainted with the gaieties \u2014 any pursuit of which would have been totally out of place, even during the latter days of her former visit. She did not go to court, though, if she had possessed the necessary rank, she might have gratified insatiable royal curiosity, which would have winked at her other disabilities, or only taunted her with them, as she passed out of the charmed circle. She went everywhere else that it was possible for her to go. She walked in the parks and in Kensington Gardens, and saw all the finest people, and all the political and literary lions. She visited the Tower where she had been a prisoner, in the character of an ordinary sight-seer, but with a sense of grateful relief and incredulous wonder, which does not come to an ordinary sight-seer. She visited St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey. She went to routs and as- semblies. She was at Drury Lane and Covent Garden when David Garrick played, and the last approved contralto or soprano illustrated the differ- ence between tweedledum and tweedledee. She saw the old King returning from a review of his troops, and had plain, middle-aged, dowdy Lady Yarmouth"], [254, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 234 \u2014 sitting bolt upright and apathetic in her carriage \u2014 pointed out as part of the procession. Flora had her evenings at Vauxhall, and her mornings at Hampton Court, Greenwich, and Rich mond. She missed nothing which a young intelligent gentlewoman could seek to compass, in order to carry the remembrance away with her as a subject of amused reflection and polite conversation for the rest of her life. She did not forget her friends ; she waited on young Madam Murwick, who screamed with joy on seeing her. She paid her duty, as she was bound to do, to Lady Primrose, who, if years of tribulation and constant disappointment had blunted her every emotion, with one exception, had not forgotten or ceased to appreciate Flora, or learnt to think she had been sufficiently recompensed for the services she had rendered to the Hope of the Jacobites. -It was in connection with the grave, preoccupied woman that the incident happened which made by far the deepest and most abiding impression on Flora, of all the wonderful things she accomplished during her second stay in London. The prelude to this event was the arrival at Lady Marget's lodgings, one August evening, of Mrs. Drelincourt, Lady Prim rose's waiting gentlewoman, in Lady Primrose's coach, with an imperative message for Miss Mac donald to repair at once to her ladyship's house in Essex Street. Lady Marget was out in her sedan chair, and there was nothing to hinder Flora from complying with the request. Flora had grown accustomed to the ways of the house, busy with abortive, spider-web schemes, and specious shallow mysteries which those in power, who cared to penetrate, could read from end to end."], [255, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 235 The house had hospitably entertained Flora Mac donald and she had a genuine respect and regard for its mistress ; but it had always seemed to the healthy minded young woman, with her rightly balanced reason, that the very air of the place was echoing with whispers and cautions, and that there were sentences in cipher, and unknown tongues written on the walls. The frequenters of the mansion wore disguises \u2014 more or less cunning, and answered to assumed outlandish names. The fantastic machinery of hopelessly handicapped conspiracy was in fuU force. Flora felt as if broad daylight ought not to be admitted on the premises, and as if, to be in entire keeping, the uninitiated intruder should have her ears pierced by the hoot of an owl, and her face struck by the clammy wings of a bat as it blundered past her. Flora was not astonished at the peremptoriness of the summons, or at the solemn importance of Mrs. Drelineourt who took her cue from her lady, and whUe she would not drop a hint of what Lady Prim rose wanted with Flora, contrived to give the impression that it was something of vital consequence. But Flora remarked nothing out of the common tiU she had entered the house \u2014 not in the dim, dank darkness she held suited to it, but in the golden haze of a hot summer sunset. Then she saw that the porter who opened the hall door and closed it jealously after her was supported in his office by a couple of coadjutors, that indeed the ordinary lacqueys on the staircase and in the approach to the public rooms, on a night when Lady Primrose was receiving company, were indefinitely multiplied, while more than one or two of them looked as if they were not"], [256, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 236 really domestics, but had adopted the Primrose livery, in which they were not quite at home, for purposes of their own. Flora had not expected a gathering of guests. She had imagined that Lady Primrose wished to see her by herself. She had come off without any of the delay and preparation she had been forbidden to indulge in, wearing the simple gauze gown she had been in the habit of donning for evenings at home, in which she had been sitting waiting for Lady Marget to come in to supper. Flora did not know yet whether Lady Primrose might not merely take her aside and say the word she had to say to her in the ante-room, until her Ladyship appeared and showed a contrary intention. Lady Primrose came through the doorway into which guests were crowding, glancing curiously on all sides of them, and talking to each other in earnest undertones. The hostess took Flora by the hand, and proceeded to lead her unresisting into the reception rooms. \"I thought you would like to come; I knew you were to be trusted if any one was, Miss Macdonald,\" whispered Lady Primrose, with her furtive eyes and her furtive voice. \"I'm sure you're entitled to the honour, and I've no doubt it will be an agreeable surprise to the august person we are chiefly bound to consider.\" The speaker was in the same unrelieved black she had worn since Sir Archibald's execution, four years before. She was still sparer and wanner, her whole air was more introspective and abstracted than ever. She looked even more like the ghost of the past, whose stern stealthy mission is retribution and restitution."], [257, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 237 \" What is she after now ? \" thought Flora in some alarm, glancing with mingled pity and apprehension at the woman who had been her good friend, whom, nevertheless, Flora could not help viewing as beside herself. \"Has she some fresh deep-laid plot in hand ? Is she seeking to draw me into it ? \u2014 me who am with Lady Marget. But what use would a young woman of no account like me be to these great folks in their cabals, and Lady Marget will take care of herself for the sake of her bairns.\" The company consisted mostly of gentlemen in evening dress, several of them with ports and gaits which proclaimed them of no mean rank. But all of them were conducting themselves, at the present moment, as if they were affected by the brooding, over charged atmosphere around them, as if they would prefer to carry their dignity under a cloak, be without the notice and attention which the magnates were ac customed to look upon elsewhere as their due. Flora's quick eyes detected a gentleman in clerical dress, a man of unobtrusive mien, moving quietly among the others. There were a few ladies be-hooped, be-lappeted, and be-jewelled, as if they had stepped in, on their way to a popular assembly. Two of them Flora had already seen in public, and during her previous stay with Lady Primrose. They were Jacobite ladies of standing, habituees of the house, but it was not Flora's part to claim their acquaintance. Another lady, who was younger and much more conspicuous than the others, Flora did not know. The stranger was a tall woman about Flora's age \u2014 that is, in what ought to have been her prime. She had fine features which were rapidly becoming too strongly marked, and a waxen complexion which demanded a considerable"], [258, "238 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" application of rouge to conceal the unhealthy pallor that had taken the place of delicate bloom. In like manner the premature tokens of late hours and habits of dissipation were shown \u2014 where the originally abundant dark hair was replaced by a costly wig, the curls of which were of the most profuse and elaborate description. The dress of the lady was almost ostentatiously rich, whUe the blaze of her diamonds and rubies far exceeded that of any other dame of degree in the room. But such pretensions to beauty as she still retained were greatly marred by the peculiarly insolent defiance of her bold roving eyes, and the unmistakable marks of gross self indulgence in the loosening lines of the naturally sensual mouth. The increasing breadth of the whole lower portion of the face was accentuated by the haughty pose of the head, which threw out the solid chin and face in relief against the strong white throat and massive bust, from which the priceless lace of the brocade bodice fell back in soft folds. The lady sat in a foremost place, in an armchair, and contrived, whether by the potentiality of hex presence or by the aggressiveness of her demeanour, almost to obscure the groups of gentlemen on each side of her. At the same time it struck Flora, during the few minutes in which she had space to make the observation, while Lady Primrose conducted her, in a condition of bewilderment, through the numerous groups moving in a phantasmagorial manner, to the upper end of the farther room, that a certain constraint prevailed in the neighbourhood of this prominent person in the circle. She seemed treated with all deference, but few people directly approached her and still fewer addressed her ; and as she sat thus isolated, in the face of the reluctance to"], [259, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 239 admit her title to precedence \u2014 whatever it might be \u2014 her straight marked brows lowered more and more over the blaze of her eyes, her coarse mouth twitched, her painted cheeks grew scarlet, she worked her fan with furious jerks of the hand clenched upon it \u2014 symptoms of a storm of ungovernable rage, in danger of distorting her whole handsome face and commanding person. The next instant, Flora had been taken past this formidable guest, and brought still higher up the room, which ended in the deep embrasure of a curtained window. Before the curtain, slightly in advance of the gentleman with whom he was talking, stood a familiar figure, even where it was most altered, a figure which Flora could never forget. It came to her like a new revelation, even while it was full of old associations \u2014 of a boat pitching and rocking in the darkness of a midnight storm \u2014 of long weary tramps in a mist of rain over the soaking heather \u2014 of the cheer of the smoking fire-light in the Kings barrow dining-parlour \u2014 of the parting in the gloom of the gathering night, on the pier at Portree. It was the Prince in England, in London, though not at St. James's Palace, where he had so often promised to be ; it was the Prince when she had least expected to see him, in what fresh jeopardy she had little difficulty in comprehending. But when Flora looked again she was tempted to doubt the evidence of her senses. Could four years have wrought such changes ? Was this \" bonnie Prince Charlie \" \u2014 this the blythe, kind, gallant lad who had so shouted with laughter at his own image in Betty Burke's gown and brat, mantle and mutch, in the best bedroom at Kingsbarrow, who had made"], [260, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 240 light of every privation and danger to himself, and sought always to spare her fatigue and discomfort, during their period of comradeship \u2014 this man who was barely thirty years of age ? His fine figure stooped \u2014 not with a student's bend, not with the slouch of a careless, ungainly man like Milton, but with the droop of sloth, of physical and moral degradation \u2014 of the man who among his other losses has parted for ever with his self-respect, who has nothing to win as he has nothing to lose, the pensioner on a foreign king, the sinecurist whose sinecure is his birth and the bounty of unfortunate adherents, already impoverished in his cause. The originally handsome, winning face was fast becoming unlovely, unlovable. His beautiful eyes were bleared and scorched by unholy fires. His cheeks were growing puffed and of a pasty whiteness, as if they came more and more rarely in contact with wholesome daylight and fresh air. His mouth was spoilt and his jowl was growing brutally heavy \u2014 like that of the woman in the armchair, before him. The stamp of aimless idleness, objectless wandering, and evil doing, the brand of his recent disgraceful arrest in Paris, imprisonment at Vincennes, and expulsion from France which his own reckless obstinacy brought upon him, had pressed hard on the princely gifts and graces of the lad, and eaten deep into them. Above all, the shameless profligacy which had descended from father to son, and the hard drinking to which he had yielded, without a struggle, in which he had sought and found the sorriest and most fatal of refuges, had wrought short work with the hero of the '45. The destruction was not yet complete ; but, even at what she saw now, Flora stood aghast ; she could"], [261, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 241 hardly restrain the \"Eh! sirs,\" the Scotch expletive for the extremity of astonishment and regret. But Lady Primrose was seizing the opportunity of a slight movement of dismissal to his companion on the Prince's part, to bring Flora before him. \" May I venture to intrude on your Royal High ness ? \" said the devoted woman, blind to all except what she cared to see. She spoke with the pro soundest respect, while she gave Flora an example of the deepest curtsy human knees could accomplish. \"I flatter myself you wiU excuse the liberty \u2014 when you see what old acquaintance I have summoned to pay her homage to her prince.\" The Prince made another gesture of slight, but significant, ill-suppressed impatience, and turned entirely from the gentleman with whom he had been in conversation. This gentleman happened to be a personal follower, of no great rank, whom his master could dispose of without ceremony, and the disposal was carried out so curtly, with such imperious arro- gance of manner that Flora blushed hotly for both the dealer and the receiver of what was little short of an insult between the men, in the domineering tones of the tyrannical voice, and the haughty wave of the hand. It was white now, instead of brown, and there was not a fleck of blood to stain its whiteness. But the flabby nerveless fingers, loaded with rings, shook as Flora had never seen them shake after days of struggle and nights spent on the most unrestful of couches. Flora was forcibly reminded of the look and air of the lady in the chair, at a pace or two's distance. Flora curtsied without offering to kiss the hand which was extended to her. The Prince looked at her with lacklustre eyes R"], [262, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 242 which wavered in then look, rather than met the gazer's eye (this they had been observed to do even when these clouded, darkened eyes were clearest and most honest). Did he not know her again ? Flora asked herself with a natural pang, just as the light of recognition kindled in the changed eyes. \"Ah! Miss Macdonald, is it you?\" he inquired with manifest effort, and corresponding awkward embarrassment. \" I am glad to see you, madam. When did you come to town ? I hope you had a safe and agreeable journey.\" He spoke with much more of a foreign accent than Flora had heard on his tongue, after he had been many months in Scotland, surrounded by Scotchmen. His very articulation, blurred and thickened even while he clipped his words, sounded altogether different. Before Flora could reply to his greeting as she hardly knew how, by trusting that his Royal High ness had had a pleasant journey, in order to attain the hazardous position in which he then stood, he spoke again with more decision and purpose, and as he spoke he closed his hand with convulsive energy. \" You must see for yourself, madam, that I have as little in my power as I ever had. With all the will to repay the obligations which I am far from denying that I received from some of my father's subjects, on sundry occasions, I regret to be forced to state that I am still utterly without the ability to discharge these debts, it would otherwise be so agreeable to me to wipe out. You see in me still, madam, a poor disinherited exile, having barely the means to supply myself and my household with the common necessaries which our station demands. I am at the"], [263, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 243 present moment, as you wdl not fail to understand, in imminent personal danger, since I have been deluded into coming on another bootless expedition to this unhappy country. The support I was promised has failed me as before, and there is nothing left for me,\" he ended with a scowl, \" save to withdraw once more, if withdrawal is yet possible.\" He spoke with concentrated bitterness and hardly suppressed rage, but she had not heard the last of his words. She had been standing before him white with mortification and affront. \"Mercy on me! Is he feared that I am low enough to come and beg from him, for payment for what I did? Has he sunk so low as to entertain such a mean and sordid apprehension ? \" she asked herself wrathfully. Then there darted across her mind a remembrance of the mistress of Kings- barrow's snuff-box which she bestowed on the prey of the hunters, hiding under her roof, destined to bring it to wreck and ruin. That snuff-box with its legend of the old King's \" fule \" \u2014 its sign of the two clasped hands \u2014 its motto, \"For stark love and kind- ness.\" How ill had he read the lesson, how little had he laid it to heart ! Should she tell him that he need not \" fash \" about a reward to her, who had never sought for it, whUe it had been Uberally pressed upon her by the voluntary justice and gratitude of his party ? Should she offer to transfer to him some of the money still in the hands of Mr. Clerk, merchant ? He might think it was so much taken from him, and wasted on her. He might grudge that it had not passed into his hands \u2014 that he and the harpy in the chair might spend it on riotous living. She believed that at this moment he would have greedily clutched at it."], [264, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 244 Happily for both Flora and the Prince, an inter ruption put a stop to the discussion before it reached this point. The shrill vixenish voice of the lady in the chair, ordered him to her side, with an Angry complaint, which he dared not disregard. For the man who resisted the reasonable remonstrances of the faithful friends that had sacrificed all for him, cowered, when in his sober senses, before the flights of the Delilah who lorded it over him, who had fed and fattened herself on him, robbing him of what was of infinitely higher price than silver or gold. \"Is this your gallantry, sir? A fig for it,\" the high-pitched cockney accents proclaimed, over the lady's heaving shoulder. \"Am I to be left to sit here all night alone while you traffic with your agents ? \" As the Prince hurried to the speaker to pacify her, and prevent her making a farther display of her folly and insolence \u2014 a farther exposure of herself and him, Flora made her way past them, glad to escape with no more than a word of leave-taking to her harassed hostess. In passing through the doorwaj', Flora encountered a great Scotch nobleman whose name she could guess, whose indignant growl she was near enough to hear. \"What impudent limmer is yon, his Highness has thought fit to bring into decent company?\" He spluttered out his words, with an irate glance at the beautiful Wickedness in the chair. \"It is nobody better than the daughter of Walkin shaw the banker,\" answered the person addressed, with a snort, which he did not smother, even in a presence which he reckoned royal. \" It is her who has a sister housekeeper to the other Prince of Wales,"], [265, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 245 so that she is supposed to have all our heads in a noose, under her arm. But if people only knew, that is not the worst of this miss. The connection with her began so far back as when he was in Scotland, and no sooner had he escaped than he sent for her to join him abroad. Mind my words, my lord, she will not rest content with stripping him of the better part of his pension from King Louis, she will drag him down, body and soul, to her own place, which, by your lordship's leave, I will not particularize farther.\" CHAPTER XXI. \"Fye ! let us a' to the bridal.\" Old Song. Flora had come back to her far Hebrides, when no doubt she might, if she would, have continued to prink and plume herself, as far forward as any of her contemporaries, amidst the pride of life, the luxury and gaiety of the great city. This was not all, it had slipped out, before her arrival, that, though Lady Marget was tarrying in Edinburgh, in the course of the long homeward journey, Flora had hurried on with some chance escort, so eager was she to be at home again. Yes ; and Allan Kingsbarrow's massive figure, stately and soldier-like as ever, was conspicuous among the friends awaiting her landing from the ferry-boat. For it was now clearly settled that Sir James's tutors or guardians should, till the boy was of competent age, make a due acknowledgment to old Kingsbarrow of his sufferings as scapegoat for his employers ; while lambing season continued favourable, and"], [266, "246 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" prices of cattle were keeping up to a wonder \u2014 on such material trifles do the issues of our Uves depend, \u2014 until Allan began to be persuaded that the farm of Flodigarry, with the farmhouse set down on Loch Snizort in the midst of the grandest of the grand Skye scenery, might pay, and might not be an un worthy downsitting even for Flora Milton. \" You wiU be come back, Flora ? \" \" I will be that, Allan,\" was all their greeting, and though, in their Scotch shyness, they did no more than clasp hands on the words, all present who saw and heard them knew that Allan Kingsbarrow and Flora Milton would be man and wife before the winter came. There were those who noticed also that, from that moment, the gladness returned to Flora's steel-blue eyes and the lightness to her step, her voice took a softer, sweeter tone, and she was young Flora Milton once more. For some reason, surely to save trouble to some body, Flora consented to repair beforehand, like a sovereign princess, to her future husband's house of Flodigarry, and be married there. Mrs. Mac donald, Kingsbarrow, with Kingsbarrow and Nanny, was afready at her son's house putting it in order for his bride. It was considerably beyond the autumn equinox, a season of the year when the crossing from South Uist to Skye was sometimes impracticable for days, even weeks at a time, so that it could not be counted on with any confidence. The arrangements entered into consulted the con venience of more than the bride and bridegroom. There was Lady Marget with her younger children. There was Mrs. Hugh Macdonald, Armadale, with her invalid habits which asked for more consideration"], [267, "\"THE\"* MACDONALD LASS.\" 247 than her \" small family \" claimed. If she put sufficient force upon herself to come from Sleat to Flodigarry in order to be present at her daughter's marriage, it was not to be thought for a moment, that she would cross, so late in the season, from Skye to the Long Island, even to occupy her son's house of Milton. The marriage was fixed to take place on the 6th of November, 1750, and it was to be celebrated with no ordinary distinction. Flora Macdonald was not a common woman, she was not married every day, and she had paid the Hebrides the supreme com pliment of accepting one of the island dhuinnewassels for her bridegroom, and of consenting \u2014 she who had seen the great world, to settle down with him, for the rest of her days, in Skye. The festivities, consisting chiefly of athletic games, contests on the pipes, and dancing, were to last for a week, as on the marriages of kings and great nobles in the middle ages. A Skye man has thus described the scenery round Flodigarry. \"Above it hung the towering Cliffs of Quiraing, to the east was the Sound of Gairloch, with Loch Slaffin and its little island. Opposite rose the Gairloch Hills. Close at hand was the Bay of Steineschall with its great boulders. Beyond stood the basaltic wall of Garafad, cloven into huge gorges.\" Was there ever a nobler setting for the home of such a woman as Flora Macdonald ? But men and women could not lie down and sleep, as a matter of course, under beetling crags, or lulled by the dash of a waterfall like \" Sir Rory's Nurse.\"* Pleasure- * The waterfall to whose monotonous music the wakeful chieftain, Sir Roderick Macleod, used to sleep, was known to the clan as 44 Sir Rorv's Nurse.\""], [268, "248 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" seekers of the hardiest description could not appease their hunger and quench their thirst by cropping the grassy bits among the heather wastes, or by drinking from the water of the tarns as the sheep and the cattle drank. Farther than this, how the expenses of enter taining a multitude in any other fashion could be defrayed by a Highland gentleman little richer than his neighbours, involved a mystery only understood by the initiated, while Flodigarry was but a thatched farmhouse, roomy \u2014 hardly spacious. One explanation was that the Highland gentry of the past were as quick of resource and as enviably easy to lodge and board as they were long descended, with manners hovering between lawless fierceness and courtly gentleness. 44 A bootless host of highborn beggars, Macleans, Mackenzies, and Macgregors.\" The tying of the indissoluble knot, which only the invited families of the bride and bridegroom and their intimate friends were expected to witness, would certainly take place \u2014 not in the little parish kirk twenty miles distant, but in the low-roofed, small windowed dining-room, with its matchless view. For the mass of the outdoor company a satisfactory provision was made. The ball-room, which was to be silled for many hours of the twenty-four, was also to serve as a banqueting room. It was an extem porized wooden building, roofed with birch boughs and heather, floored with pine, lit by pine torches, and furnished with tiers of benches. Of the two great barns, one was reserved for the ladies, with just room left to move among the mat tresses spread on the floor, to the wash-hand stands and looking-glasses ranged against and hung upon the"], [269, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 249 walls, where the ladies' trunks and band-boxes stood in long rows. The second barn required less transformation. It was filled with clean straw, on which the gentlemen, after casting off their dress-coats, could stretch them selves ; while for baths, at a few paces distant lay the loch, not yet frozen hard, or the river rushing from a neighbouring height, with such foaming and swirling rapidity, that it was only in the severest storms it was more than fringed with glittering blue white icicles. The food and the drink \u2014 the legs of mutton, the \" sides \" of beef, the haunches of venison, the kippered salmon, the hecatombs of fowls, grouse, black cock, wild geese, wild swans, the piles of white bread to supplement the oat-cakes and barley bannocks, the pastry and sweetmeats to alternate with the \"whangs \" of ewe-milk cheese, the whiskey, brandy, claret, and red Burgundy came in generous abundance from every gentleman's larder and cellar within a score of miles. Nobody took note of it. No body offered it with awkward hesitation or received it with stiff thanks. It was a liberal contribution made \u2014 according to old custom \u2014 by friend to friend, to be repaid, with interest, when the donor's turn came. \"Folk ought to marry but once, as they die once, since weddings and dergies are a great out-put of time, trouble, and siller,\" the Mistress of Kingsbarrow laid down the dogma, in the middle of her manifold responsibilities and labours, on the occasion of the marriage of her eldest son Allan. \" There is a likeness between marriage and death,\" Flora, who was sparing her friend as much fatigue as was possible, admitted, thoughtfully. \" There is the same cutting off from the past and launching out into the future. Marriage and death are equally"], [270, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 250 beyond remede, and to get the desire of the heart, which is what renders marriage true and blissful, and serves as the counterbalance and cure, for every un guessed evil it may contain, comes but once, like death itself to every mortal creature.\" \"Have you got the desire of your heart? Is our Allan your desire ? \" asked Allan's mother, a great curiosity and a tender interest evercoming her old Scotchwoman's disinclination to talk sentiment, and her sympathetic reserve. It was pretty to see the girlish bashfulness, the delicate maidenliness, like the unbrushed-off dew on the rose and bloom on the grape, which stole into and softened Flora's strength, and got the better of her self-possession, converting it into rosy confusion. But she did not refuse to make her confession to his mother, who was also one of Flora's oldest and best friends. \"Yes, he is,\" she said; \"and he has been ever since I knew him in his quietness to be my master. That was six years ago come Candlemas. I had gone to see a sick woman, near the ' stanin ' stones. I was not alone, for the Boisdale girls had been staying with us at Milton ; but we were to part when we came to the hill-road, for they were going up the hill to see their cousins at Balloch. The February light was failing just when we were bidding each other good-bye, and Allan came up to us. He told me he had passed a party of boatmen who were having a splore, after drinking at the change-house in the Clachan. He said he would see me home, as the Boisdale girls had two gillies coming up behind with their ponies and luggage, while I was alone. I refused \u2014 partly because I was proud of my inde pendence, partly because I would not let myself see"], [271, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 251 that I liked his company, when he had said nothing to bespeak my liking, and, most of all, because I caught my companions glancing at us, and laughing in their sleeves. He persisted in his offer, and I was as resolute in declining it, till the other girls were gone and I had started to walk back to Milton. I could see with the tail of my eye, he had turned and was following me. I was mad with anger then, for I thought he did not mind what I said, and did not care though he made a laughing-stock of me. I marched on without a word, or a blink over my shoulder. I told myself that I would never speak to him again ; I felt as if I could have struck him in my bootless rage. \" Then all of a sudden, just as the road grew darkest, I heard the loud tongues and the stumbling feet of the boatmen behind, gaining upon us. I had thought I could take care of myself as well as any young woman could, but I suppose it was in the daylight, with sober men, or gentlemen, or at least men I kenned for my assailants. One of the boat men seized me by the arm, and proposed that I should oxter in (walk arm-in-arm) with him. I tried to wrench myself away from him and his caresses, without success, till Allan forced himself between us, and knocked the man down, without a word. The other men closed in around Allan and I was doubtful for a moment what would happen next ; but he struck out right and left, for he is a man in his strength, and he was sober while they were blind drunk. He either sent them sprawling at his feet, or caused them to slink off the way they had come. \" Then I walked on, and he followed me \u2014 still without a word, as far as the gate of Milton, when he lifted his hat and went his way, without waiting"], [272, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 252 for me to apologize, or to say I was obliged to him. The moon had risen, and I saw his face as he went, and I think it was what it will look like when he lies in his coffin. I have not found, from that day to this, that speech on the occurrence ever passed his lips. Certainly he never mentioned it to me, and the Boisdale girls remained ignorant alike of his foUowing me, and of our encountering an obstacle in our path. But I knew from that night AUan was my master, and the man in the world for me.\" CHAPTER XXII. 44 And aye the owercome o' his sang Was ' Waes me for Prince Charlie.1 Glen. There was still an interval before Flora and Allan should be \"cried\" three times in the kirk, and the week of universal mirth and jollity should begin. Flora was still untrammelled by the requirements of a lord and master, and, late .as it was in autumn, she slipped away from the bustle, andjnade her last expe dition as Flora Milton across to the Long Island, that she might repair to Kilmossie and see her cousin Lorraine, who was in an ailing state of health, almost past hoping and praying for. Lorraine had gone on drooping and pining through out these four years, till everybody who knew her said she was far gone, in that deadly malady of the young styled \"a decline.\" Milton was inconsolable. It made Flora's heart ache to see the patches of grey among his red-brown hair, and to notice how seldom he raised the head, which hung persistently on his breast. He had"], [273, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 253 ceased to care for his garden, even his fields and offices were neglected. Neither pipe nor snuff-mull, nor glass of steaming punch solaced him. He had well-nigh abandoned the big Milton kitchen chimney corner, where he had been wont to sit with shepherd and game-keeper, and servant lass looking up to him as a superior being, bringing to him the minutest de tails of their work and play, consulting him on every trifle which concerned him and them \u2014 the signs of the weather \u2014 the ailment which had appeared among Lachlan Lenzie's sheep \u2014 the whale which had been seen from ' Raasay's Cap ' spouting at the heels of the last of the mackerel \u2014 the fresh lair of the red deer \u2014 the wildest tale of what was to be earned by kelp burning \u2014 the newest gossip of the bitter quarrel between Alister Mohr and little Cathock of the Crab Holes whose daughter he had been courting. Men and women now went about Milton as if the dead lay in the house, the very dogs had taken to drooping their tails, raising their long heads, closing their dispirited eyes, and howling in the most dismal fashion. When Flora reached Kilmossie, she found Lorraine stretched listlessly on the settee in the sitting-room, looking as white and shadowy as the ghostly crew with which she was in the habit of keeping company. It did seem as if she would soon be one of them. When the cousins were left alone together, Flora sought in vain to rouse her companion. Lorraine took little interest in Flora's cheerful account of all the stir and excitement going on at Flodigarry. She was unflatteringly indifferent to every particular of dress and plenishing for the bridal and the new home, for which women, as a rule, cherish an undying curiosity. She scouted the idea of so"], [274, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 254 caring for and coddling herself that she might be able to come over in spring to Skye for a change, and be one of Flora and Allan Kingsbarrow's first visitors at Flodigarry. \" I'U never quit the bounds of Kilmossie again. I'll never leave this house till I'm carried out feet foremost,\" she declared, with peevish persistency. She interrupted a pleasant description which Flora had volunteered of an inlaid tea-caddy and a silver muffin-dish which had been sent down to her all the way from London, by saying abruptly, \" I saw you the night before last, Flora, you and Allan Kings barrow, standing, side by side, as in the glint of a moonbeam, though there was no moon in the sky.\" Flora gave an irresistible shivering recoU, and then conquered herself, and sought to protest gaily \u2014 \"Well, considering that we're to stand side by side, before the minister, within the month, I think you were entitled to see us so, though I had rather you had seen us by the light of the sun than by that of the mune. Were we stepping into the muckle coach? But that could not be, since it is either in a blaze of torches or in black darkness. Has it come back to trouble you, and were we the only traveUers ? \" \" There was no coach,\" said Lorraine, slowly and dreamily; \"there was a barge.\" \"A barge,\" cried Flora, taken aback. \"That is the Macdonalds' coat of arms, as a bull's head is the Macleods'. But it is all nonsense, feverish fancjT \u2014 or worse.\" \"It is not nonsense, and it is not fancy,\" cried Lorraine, moved to indignation by the shght cast on her gift. She shook off her languor and raised herself on her elbow, thus rendering more conspicuous the bloodlessness of her white skin and the emaciation"], [275, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 255 of her figure. \" As to its being worse than fancy, I cannot tell, only, if I am devil-possessed, I cannot help myself; it is no doing of mine. You were not in the boat and neither was Allan Kingsbarrow. You were standing on the shore, hand in hand, looking out with woe in your een, at the boat which a raging sea was dashing on the rocks at your feet. There was no call for help, since the two men in the boat were dead men, lying athwart the bows, with the water dripping from their blue jackets and their hair. Their glazed een and their parted lips were foment the sky, as if they had been looking up to Him who sits on the Great White throne with their last look, and crying to Him with their last breath.\" \"God help them,\" broke from Flora, \"and God help you, poor lassie, and save you from such fear some sights \u2014 or dreams. No wonder that your blood is running slow and chill, and that you're worn to skin and bone.\" \"They were both young men,\" went on Lorraine, taking no notice of the interruption, \"goodly young men, who maun have been strong handsome chields in life. Him who was the sUmmer and the younger of the two, brought to my mind your elder brother Ranald, who died in his youth.\" \"I fail to see how that could be,\" remonstrated Flora. \" My brother Ranald has been in Paradise for many a year, so that I, who dwelt in the same house with him, was too much of a bairn when he left us, for me to have a clear remembrance of him. I question whether even Angus \u2014 who was nearer to him in years \u2014 can tell now, distinctly, how Ranald looked when he was with us in the body.\" \"For all that the drowned laddie brought Ranald into my head,\" maintained Lorraine, with the"], [276, "256 \"THE .MACDONALD LASS.\" querulous obstinacy of a sick woman. \" You will tell me next Ranald was not drowned, only nigh hand it, and killed by reason of the struggle to bring his boat to land. I cannot explain the visions and their effect upon me, any more than I can open your eyes to see them. But it is not the most gruesome of them which is breaking my heart, and bringing me to an untimely grave.\" Lorraine broke off the thread of her subject, and started a new strain, with a more passionate thrill in her voice. \"It is not that. Oh, it is not that, Flora ! It is to think of my Prince, so gallant and gude, kept out of his own, beaten, banished from the very court of France which began by sheltering his family and affording them a palace home, lest his brave hopes should work harm to the craven spirits there. I looked at my white rose before I lay down here, and the few wallied, dried-up leaves fell to pieces in my hand. Oh, it is monstrous to ken that he who deserves our fealty, next to the King of kings, should be a worsted wanderer on the face of the earth ! Flora was at her wits' end. It was a desperate case, and called for a desperate remedy \u2014 a remedy which might either cure or kill. \"Lorraine,\" said Flora, setting her teeth, \" I never telled you all that happened to me in my last visit to London. I never let on that I met Jt'un again, one night, in the course of my stay.\" \"You met him again up in London \u2014 you, my own cousin, Flora Milton, and you never let on to me, who, as you were well aware, was wasting and dying just for want of my hero, my coming king ? \" cried Lorraine, in keenest reproach. \"Yes; it is true,\" said Flora, firmly. \"And why could I not speak to you of him ? It was not just"], [277, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 257 because of the danger of telling what I knew, or mentioning his name. It was because I shrank, like a weak woman \u2014 me who am no silly young lass but a woman entering on her thirties, from blasting your faith and defiling your ears. I trusted you would tire of your phantasy. I thought you would forget in time, or you would guess how he had been weighed in the balance and found wanting.\" \"Never, never,\" denied Lorraine, in a fury which convulsed her feeble body, and left foam on her lips. But the accuser could not draw back when she had once begun the accusation, whatever havoc it might work. \" Better she should die, if die she must, knowing the truth,\" Flora told herself, with the righteous sternness, underlying her modesty and kindness, which she had inherited from \"the strong minister.\" \"Better she should die undeceived, than that she should go to her Maker believing a lie, and worship- ping a false idol.\" \" It was at my lady Primrose's where he wras,\" she proceeded with deliberate calm- ness. \" He had crossed the sea again to spy the land. It was as before, he had no force in the background to support him. He was conscious of no crisis in European or in English politics. There was not the most distant symptom of a general rising, which could warrant his renewal of the attempt to win back the crown. Oh yes, he was invited, I grant you ; there will always be infatuated bigots and mad sides who are so set on getting their own way, and so enamoured of mischief, that they will welcome civil war and its miseries to thousands, and prefer to perish in it, rather than be quiet and mind their own business. As for himself be cared as little as s"], [278, "258 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" ever whom he put in jeopardy, or what blood he spilled as he went on his way. Some folk call that princely courage, but I call it rank selfishness ; the whole world might come to an end so that he and his had another chance of regaining the power they had abused. But the chance was so small and impotent that even he, with his reckless fool-hardi ness, had to give in, and own, with his followers, that the time was not yet ripe, and go back as secretly as he had come to the place he had left. Lorraine, the time will never be ripe \u2014 not that there is no pity and no good-wiU felt for the auld Stuarts in the kingdoms they did their best to ruin, but because they have sealed their death-warrants, as far as these countries are concerned, with their own hands.\" \"What treason! What disloyalty! \" wailed Lorraine. \" And how can you ken ? A young woman no older than myself, taken up with such idle, silly troke as love-making and marriage, when the affairs of kings and nations are at stake.\" \" But I do ken this much. I've listened to what wise men and true patriots have said,\" argued Flora, \"though I do not pretend to be wiser than in 3- neigh bours, and I'm willing \u2014 willing quo' I ? I'm proud and happy to be and do like other women, to be the wife of the man I love dearly, and trust with all my heart. It should be the greater reason to put faith in me, Lorraine, if I cut no capers, after the manner of \u2014 I'll not say whom. I do not profess to be far above and beyond my fellow-creatures, in their natural ties ; I desire nothing better than the honest, humble common lot, the sweet, solemn, human destiny my Maker has ordained for me. But we were not speaking of yon and me, but of him \u2014 the"], [279, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 259 Prince. Do not look so wild, Lorraine, hear me out this once. Mind you cannot deny that you saw him yourself in a vision \u2014 waes me for bonnie Prince Charlie ! \u2014 a bloated, broken-down, brutalised man, maist doited, if he was not demented.\" \"But he was auld, auld and care-ridden,\" urged Lorraine, fighting desperately for her idol. \"The weight of a crown had bowed his high head. His enemies had withstood and slandered him as you are doing now, till he had lost heart to defy them, and give them the lie in then- teeth. His friends and favourites had sought but their own, and played him false, till they had dragged him down from his great estate.\" \" They could not make him a sot, and a rake, and he not a \"consenting party.\" Flora shook her head incredulously. \" Forby you speak as if he had been king. Woe betide the country if that ill-fortune had come to pass ! \" \"And what of King George \u2014 auld German Geordie ? \" burst out Lorriane, with a vehemence of scorn and malice, which showed there was some spirit left in her. \"I can say little,\" owned Flora, shaking her head again, ruefully this time. \" I trow his Majesty is neither saint nor hero, though he was a brave enough little fighting-cock of a soldier in his day, both Whigs and Tories admit. It is the nature of men, and I cannot see that they are entitled to many thanks for not being coward loons. But he was the choice of the nation in the middle of his vices and follies, and he has paid some respect to the nation's wishes and welfare. He listened to his gude wife when he had her, and he has listened to his Ministers, and shown moderation and clemency \u2014 as I, and many more"], [280, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 260 than me, are here to testify. It is more than doubt ful whether King Charles III., if he were ever to exist, would do half as much. I misdoubt, after what I've learnt by the evidence of my own senses, that if it had been ordained he should reign for the punishment of the people, he would have turned out another Rehoboam. Where his grandfather sought to scourge his subjects with whips, this man would have tried the same trick with scorpions. But it is all over, all ended for the best, and we may sing our thanks with Miriam \u2014 that once more in the long record of the ages, Jehovah has triumphed, the tyrant is vanquished, and the nation is free. Nay, do not cover your face, my dear lassie, King Charles that was to be, that, thank God, never wUl be, is a chimera \u2014 a dream. It is Prince Charles I wish to speak to you about. Oh ! do you not think I was sorry \u2014 sorry to see how the evil had worked, though the years were few ? tWhere was the high-spirited, light-hearted lad who had rowed with me on the stormy sea, and tramped with me when we were as drooket and sore-footed as tinklers on the moors, and never owned he was weary, but turned his mis fortunes into a laugh and a jest ? I could not find him, Lorraine, in the heavy, sour man \u2014 with drink and debauchery already writ plain, in ugly characters, on what had been his handsome face \u2014 to whom they took me up and presented me.\" \"Was he not civil, courteous like himself?\" Lorraine could not resist asking in a mazed, half-choked voice. \" Oh yes ; he was quite courteous and civil \u2014 how could a man, a gentleman and a Prince, be otherwise ? He minded me again \u2014 with a fight, and was pleased to say he was glad to see me, and hinted he would not forget my services. I cannot tell whether he named"], [281, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 261 St. James's \u2014 as he was fond to do when he was in the wilds. The palace was a hantle nearer to him in point of locality, but it was thousands of miles further away from him, in the sense of his ever dwelling there. I might have been readier to believe his courtesy if he had ever sent me a scrape of a pen, or a message by word of mouth, since that wet darkling night we parted on the pier at Portree. There was nothing singular in the treatment. It is a way the Stuarts have had for generations. They forget, my dear \u2014 they or they take as their due the trifles of benefits that have cost the givers dear, a deal dearer than any kindness on my part cost me, though there were days, ay, and weeks and months when I thought I had tholed a great loss at his hands. Moreover, I was sensible that I had been the means of half ruining my nearest kindred and best friends on his account.\" \" Did he speak aught of Scotland or of any of his friends here?\" asked Lorraine, faint and low \u2014 \"of any who were sighing to see his face again ? \" \" Not farther than I have telled you,\" answered Flora, resolute to keep nothing back, though her own heart bled as she realized the anguish of the wound she sought to probe and cleanse. \" He did not speer for you, Lorraine, he had not a word to spend on poor old Kingsbarrow, or Clanranald, or Cluny lying hiding in his hole to this day. I confess the Prince was a thought engaged when we had our interview. There were various gentlemen being brought up to kiss his hand and speak with him. But there was something else which was engrossing his attention, more than was politic behaviour to the men of rank and station who were hazarding great risks by their presence there that night.\""], [282, "262 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" \"And what was that?\" inquired Lorraine, in a cold whisper. \" It was his ongoings with Walkinshaw's daughter, whom he feared to offend, whomsoever else he might estrange,\" said Flora, sternly. \" If he had grown hard and haughty, she was harder and haughtier. Oh, Lorraine, it made my blood boil to see the proud base woman rampaging over the weak sinful man in her toils, seeking to trample on the honourable company she was not fit to enter. Lorraine, you ken I would not be the woman to cast a stone at any poor fallen lass in her disgrace and sorrow ; but I could not stand that shameless quean flaunting her degradation before cheeks which blushed, and eyes that fell at the sorry spectacle ; she would have ordered honest men and virtuous women about, that she might sail past them, looking down upon them with sneering contempt. How Lady Primrose could endure her company I cannot comprehend. I pos sessed my soul in patience for a time \u2014 I could see no beauty in her bold een, her painted cheeks, the impudent turn of her head, save what belonged to the corruption of the charnel house and the flames of the pit. Lest I should break out like a randy and say what I thought of Madam Walkinshaw, I craved leave to retire.\" Lorraine turned with a sob to the wall. \" You have killed me, Flora Milton,\" was all she said. \" No, no, do not say that, Lorraine,\" Flora besought her cousin. \" Say I've cured you from wasting your life on a delusion, from continuing to spurn the true love which an honest man has been lavishing at your feet well-nigh all the years you have been in this world. Poor Milton worships the very ground you tread on. Milton never evened another to be worthy"], [283, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 263 so much as to hold up your gown tails. He offers you a heart as fresh and honest as your own. My bonnie woman, you are breaking his heart and leaving him desolate, for the sake of him whom you elected to be your prince and your hero. And what has he done to justify the election ? He has forfeited his prince dom and dishonoured his manhood. He has forgotten your name, your face, as he would have forgotten mine, if I had not been brought to his knowledge once more, in toying with a wanton, and drinking himself conscienceless, brainless, and heartless.\" But Lorraine lay with her face to the wall, and all the words Flora could wring from her was the repetition of the bitter charge, \"You have killed me, Flora Milton.\" Flora journeyed back to Flodigarry, disturbed and depressed, her warm heart heavy and aching, her happy prospects shadowed by Lorraine's condition. When Milton arrived at Flodigarry the very next day, looking distrait and excited, a great terror seized Flora. Had she indeed killed her poor fanciful cousin by her remorseless plain speaking and cruel candour ? But Milton's first words changed the whole current of her ideas. \" I do not know what has come to Lorraine, Flora, or what you have done to her,\" and the strong man trembled in his apprehension, and his incapacity of at once believing the good which was in store for him \u2014 a plain, humdrum, middle aged man. It sounded too good, too far beyond his wildest hopes, in his most sanguine moments, too far beyond any conception of ordinary earthly joy. \" She has plucked up a spirit, and has risen from her sofa. She says she is to be well enough to come to your wedding. She claims to be your best maid, and is getting ready her dress \u2014 can you believe it ? And"], [284, "264 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" she says, Flora \u2014 what do you think? \u2014 that if she lives over the winter, and gets stronger in the spring, she will be a bride herself. She will marry me, though I've been too much of an auld coos to ask her straight out. Do you hear, Flora? and come and live with me for the rest of her days. Oh, God, have mercy on me a sinner, and grant she may be happy at my house of Milton.\" \" Angus, my brother, you've lifted a burden from my heart that was like to choke my breath,\" cried out Flora, without any farther explanation. \"I had always the ghost of a hope that Lorraine would come to her senses at last, leave her wild whims behind her and prize your regard as it deserved. I'm glad \u2014 glad as when it was all settled between me and my AUan.\" She went off to carry the news to Mrs. Macdonald Kingsbarrow, in default of Allan, who was out on the moors. \" She will be a great handful,\" said that eminently cool-headed and critical woman. \" A sick woman in the middle of the hurry-scurry of a marriage, with no room to spare for her, and no time to make of her, and wait on her fykes. I wonder what Milton was thinking of that he did not put down his foot on the proposal, and forbid her at once.\" \" But she is not going to be sick any longer,\" said Flora, confidently; \" she is putting a great force upon herself, and it will succeed, never fear. She will pick up and be her genty, bonnie self, full of her own grand providing and brave wedding-finery, ere the days begin to lengthen.\" \"Humph!\" ejaculated Mrs. Macdonald, dis paragingly. \" Like draws to like, and if fal-lals do not recover her, I ken not what will. But she has been"], [285, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 265 a silly thing all her days. There is Kilmossie and her tocher \u2014 no doubt, they'll not come amiss to your brother, and I'm pleased they should go his way ; but what he will make of her, sitting at his table-head and managing his servants, it beats me to tell. \" \"I think, \" said Flora, hopefully, \"that she will not be worse than any other delicate wife \u2014 like my mother at Armadale, for instance. Necessity is the best of teachers, and my poor Angus will grow careful and clever in playing the woman's part to relieve her \u2014 not letting the wind blow upon her if he can scong her from the blast. You will see she will have no more dreams and visions if Providence send her bairns to fill her arms and climb upon her knees ; they will hold her down to the wholesome solid world she can see, and hear, and touch ; they will disperse the unsubstantial mists of shadow-land wherever they have come from, and chase away the spectres which have haunted and distracted her. And, oh, Mrs Macdonald, think what bliss it will be for Milton to get the desire of his heart, to have and to hold for a year or a month, even though he find it, in the holding, different from what he apprehended. He is good and true as steel, and has a sagacity of his own where his duty and his business \u2014 above all where his own and other folks' beasts are in question ; but I know very well many a one would hold him but a dull, clownish Hieland laird, some up in years and given over to rustic habits. Yet if ever a common man is an ardent, inspired poet when he becomes a lover, Milton has been one in what had to do with Lorraine all these years, and you can guess how heavenly sweet it will be to him to clasp the light of his eyes, and the desire of his heart, and know she is his till death part them.\""], [286, "266 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" THE EPILOGUE. The three chapters contained in the epilogue give briefly, in narrative, the particulars which have been preserved of Flora Macdonald's later years. CHAPTER I. 44 The grimly ghost of Samuel Johnson.\" Johnson. Flora Macdonald and Allan Kingsbarrow had been married twenty-three years. They had \" flitted \" within the last two or three years from Flodigarry to Kingsbarrow. Old Kingsbarrow had not long enjoyed the pension settled upon him by Sir Alexander's son Sir James, when he came of age, in order to render the old man's last daj-s less troubled by care. The former mistress of Kingsbarrow was with her son James ; Little Nanny was a woman, with a house of her own. She had married a Skye neighbour, Mackinnon of Corrichatichin. The elder of Flora's own six sons and three daughters were no longer little lads and lasses. Charles, the eldest son, was already an officer in the King's Rangers.* Other changes \u2014 not in tbe course of Nature, and not in any light beneficial \u2014 had come about. Sir James Macdonald had grown up a fine young fellow, whose English culture had not impaired his loyalty to Scottish interests or his fidelity to old friends. He was the pride of I ady Marget's heart and the mainstay of his family and clan, when he was cut off * It was when attending his funeral that his chief said of him \u2022^Thcre lies the most finished gentleman of my family and clan.\""], [287, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 267 in the morning of his days, dying at Rome while he was still only in his twenty-fifth year. Then a king arose who knew not Joseph, a younger Sir Alexander, a weaker man, whose English educa tion had sufficed to crush all earlier associations. He reigned, unhappily for all, at Monkstadt and Armadale. He despised and detested his surround ings \" feared the sea \" \u2014 oh, ante-climax where a lord of the Isles was in question ! \u2014 married an English wife, who did not inspire him with greater sense and kindness, and treated his gentlemen-tenants and kinsmen with no consideration, rack-renting them to the utmost of his ability. He grudged the open house to the stranger, and the open hand to the poor which had been the redeeming qualities of his ancestors, while he flung away his money on Edin burgh masquerades and London routs. Naturally the stranger retaliated by mocking at his mimicry of an inferior Englishman, and his small pretensions to intellect and refinement, dubbing him \" Sir Sawney,\" and following him with gibes and jeers, while the poor who were not too poor to help themselves, led the van in that tide of emigration which threatened, if the war of American independence had not inter vened, and closed the \"Back Woods\" for a time against new colonists, to depopulate Skye. It was at this juncture that another notable visitor arrived in Skye \u2014 not a wandering prince this time, a wandering \" dominie,\" according to the disgusted Lord Auchinleck, with Auchinleck's son for the dominie's, eager, enraptured frequently drubbed cicerone. What a picturesque, quaintly cheerful, nay, jovial, episode the famous \"Tour\" makes in the gathering shadows round Kingsbarrow and the Macdonalds' corner of Skye !"], [288, "268 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" Flora heard of the expected inroad, in a garbled version, when she was over \u2014 for business or pleasure, on the mainland. The gossips said that Mr. Boswell whose name she had heard in the old Edinburgh days, was coming to the Island \" with a young English buck,\" to whom he, Mr. BosweU, was show ing the North Country. The mistake was quickly corrected and served as food for laughter. Skye and Flora were not entirely ignorant of the renown of the Great Doctor. Lady Macleod of Dunvegan had even got a glimpse of him, during a recent visit which her ladyship had paid to London, at one of the fashion able mansions which he condescended to frequent. With true Highland hospitality, and the noblesse oblige which put aside all personal considerations in order to welcome a guest, and do honour where honour was due, Dr. Johnson's journey became a triumphal progress \u2014 but for the churlishness of \" Sir Sawney\" \u2014 from the time the Doctor put his foot on these barren shores. Little as he and his generation cared for mountain scenery, he was brought to own, under the influence of sky and sea and the beetling black rocks which formed the background, \" this is very solemn ! \" \u2014 in another kind of solemnity than could be drawn from the throbbing humanity of Fleet Street \u2014 and he cordially praised the last remains of the feudal system, dear to his big Tory heart. Characteristic are the scenes of that stay in the Hebrides which \"Bozzy's\" untiring pen has preserved for the benefit of posterity. We have not only the great man, with his huge uncouth bulk clad in snuff brown, and his grand scarred face like the torrent worn everlasting hills around him, and the handsome, eager, too good-natured satellite buzzing or cluck ing before and behind his sun ; we have the Island"], [289, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 269 ladies and gentlemen, in comparatively every-day dishabille, in the act of deferring to embodied learn ing, and of doing their best in the privileged position of entertainers of distinguished company. If the general eating of toasted cheese for break fast was offensive to more than one of the hero's senses, there was always the \" dram \" to qualify the offence, and Boswell's testimony is not needed to convince the reader that the mountain-dew and the punch were alike \" super-excellent.\" The Highland ladies worshipped and petted the rude philosopher who was gentle to them, much as Hester Thrale and Fanny Burney paid him humblest homage, and waited on him hand and foot. Miss Macleod, Dunvegan made him a flannel night-cap to help him to throw off the cold in his head. Miss Macleod, Raasay played on the spinet, and sang and translated Erse for him. Miss Macpherson, the minister of Sleat's sister, played on the guitar to him, and to her he presented a copy of \"Rasselas,\" which he had about his person, just as he had presented to another girl (with a fine gradation in his gifts in accordance with the gradations of rank) a copy of Cocker's \" Arithmetic.\" Flora heard the first graphic and trustworthy report of the invaders from her sister-in-law, Nanny, and her brother-in-law, Corrichatichin, who received and lodged the travellers, on their way to Dunvegan, as well as on their return from the Castle. Nanny, whom Boswell described as \"well-bred and intelligent,\" and whom we know as bright and lively from her childhood, had no difficulty in classifying her visitors, and bringing out their distinctive traits. Another old acquaintance, Malcolm Macleod of Raasay, was at Corrichatichin to meet the strangers,"], [290, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 270 and conduct them to his brother's place of Raasay. Malcolm was now upwards of sixty years of age, but was still ruddy-cheeked and yellow-bearded, with the open face and the frank, impulsive tongue of old. There was also one of the four generations of Mac queens, who were in succession ministers of Snizort. The parish ministers were in those days the repre sentatives of the culture of the parish, especially in all which had to do with local history and antiquarian lore, and Dr. Johnson's satisfaction with this minister was marked \u2014 not only by the Doctor's measured commendations to Boswell \u2014 but by the formal an nouncement of his having written to order the Rambler and the Idler to be forwarded from Edinburgh to Snizort as acceptable additions to the reverend gentleman's library. Dr. Johnson's enjoyment of Corrichatichin was enhanced on his return visit, when all the party were better acquainted with each other. The standard of the day was not sufficiently high for even Nanny to be shocked by the deep carouse into which one of her guests was led, at the instigation of her husband, under a mistaken conception of his duty as a host, egged on by young Macneil of Col, who caused the punch-bowl to go \" round and round \" in order to see the stuff the glib Edinburgh advocate was made of. At the parting \" snack \" (which Boswell so oddly terms \" snatch \"), the brief bite before starting, when Johnson was still plying Nanny with questions regarding the Prince's visit to Skye, a pretty little comedy occurred ; she quoted to him her father's doggrel song of \"Green Sleeves and Pudding Pies,\" to which he listened greedily. The attention of the company was called to the degree in which hostess and guest were occupied with each other, when the"], [291, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 271 gay matron cried out merrily, \" I love him ! What is life without love ? \" and presently the Doctor, not to be outdone, stooped and kissed the lady's hand. Boswell is right that the chief interest of the tour centres in the meeting between Dr. Johnson and Flora Macdonald. The gentlemen turned aside, on then- way from Raasay to Dunvegan, for the express purpose of visiting Kingsbarrow. The weather in the middle of September was exactly what it had been in a memorable week of June, twenty-seven years before. The rough roads and the toUsome journeys on horseback or on foot were very much the same. The riders on this occasion arrived towards the close of the day, between gusts of wind and rain. We have their own word for it, that they were glad to find themselves in a comfortable parlour, with a good fire, and Kings barrow attending to their wants, with great courtesy. The young people and the bairns \u2014 not brought forward so prominently then as now \u2014 had been sent out of the way when there was little room to spare. Even Flora herself was not seen till supper, the preparation of which she was called on to superintend, after which she appeared for her intellectual treat. Here is the etching made by Boswell, no mean judge, after all, of Flora Macdonald at upwards of fifty years of age, in the mob-cap-and-mitten-stage of womanhood \u2014 \"A little woman of genteel appearance, uncom monly mild and well-bred.\" She had not lost her vivacity, for she told the story of what she had heard on the mainland, that Mr. Boswell was coming to Skye, and \"one, Mr. Johnson, a young English buck, with him,\" to the great amusement of the \"young English buck.\" Mr. Macqueen, the minister of Snizort, who was"], [292, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 272 still of the party, sensible of the thick-skinnedness of Boswell on the subject, when Dr. Johnson left the party, jested with the inextinguishably dapper and jaunty gentleman on bis freedom when his \"goveimor \" was gone to bed, and Boswell coolly recorded the dry jest at his own expense. The best bedroom in Kingsbarrow remained that in which the Prince had slept in one of the two beds hung with tartan curtains. There were some ad ditions to the room under Flora and Allan's reign, such as many maps on the walls, likely to be anxiously consulted by would-be emigrants. There was also Hogarth's \" print of Wilkes, grinning, with the cap of liberty on a pole before him.\" There had been some talk of Mr. Hogarth the painter, when Flora was last in London. It was the very year when he had attempted an unsuccessful sale of his pictures. Scene and actors were thoroughly in keeping ; Boswell's excited watch that he might not miss the least of his companion's impressions \u2014 Johnson's half pompous, half-pathetic remark, in reference to the bed he had slept in, that he had no ambitious thoughts there \u2014 the haunting compelling necessity, in order to live up to his erudition, which caused him to write a line of Latin on a slip of paper, and leave it on the dressing-table. Redescended to the parlour the Doctor assured his hostess, with elaborate but sincere politeness, that he would have driven a good deal farther, sooner than not have lain in that bed. Boswell tried to give the conversation a lighter turn by declaring that he believed the choice of the bedroom had been a concerted arrangement between hostess and guest."], [293, "\" THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 273 Flora lent herself to the suggestion, having re course to her own special jest, and observing blithely, \" You know young bucks are always favourites with ladies.\" But Dr. Johnson would not be baulked of the details he desired to hear, though he had a little more delicacy in pressing his point than his zealous supporter would have shown on his behalf. He came back to the charge and did his own arch rallying of the mistress of the house, which he accomplished in his peculiarly ponderous fashion. He alluded plainly to the Prince's being at Kingsbarrow, and followed up the allusion by the direct question, \"Who was with him?\" which he improved upon the next instant by the sly comment, \"we were told, madam, in Eng land there was a certain Miss Flora Macdonald with him.\" \"They were very right,\" answered the besieged lady, with a certain quiet demureness. Then, seeing how it would gratify her chief auditor, she did not wait for further urging to tell him simply the particulars of her adventure, to which he listened with unaffected pleasure, declaring the narrative ought to be written down. Scene and actors vanish in the dim distance of time, and we are left to recall how the good people who were thus exerting themselves for the delecta tion of the guests bestowing themselves upon them, were under a heavy cloud of trouble and care, increasing in darkness as the years went on. The embarrassed circumstances of the head of the house were so openly talked of, as to reach the ear of Boswell, and awaken the commiseration of that most mercurial of men. The wholesale emigration which was emptying the island of bone and sinew, and bad T"], [294, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 274 been talked of as a probable resource even at Corrichatichin, where matters were less desperate, was soon to be an accomplished fact at Kingsbarrow. CHAPTER II. 44 Ower the hills and far awa'.\" Old Song. The year after the notable visit of the learned Doctor and his friend to Skye, times were so bad, agricul turally and commercially, in the Western Highlands, that, though there were no more rebeUions and no more proscriptions and confiscations, many of the younger branches of the great houses emigrated to the southern states of North America, and among the emigrants were the Macdonalds of Kingsbarrow. Flora may be said to have struck deep roots into her native sod, if such a process can be recorded of a woman who, like the best and wisest of her sex, is furnished with superior powers of adapting herself to fresh surroundings. She was ready in her middle age, with threads of silver in her brown hah, her bright blue eyes growing dim, her light step waxing slow \u2014 in anticipation of the final falter, to rise up, sever past ties, and with renewed activity and revived cheerfulness, follow her husband the wide world through, if by doing so she could promote his welfare and that of their children. In the month of August, 1774, the Macdonalds sailed from Campbelton in the merchant ship Balliol, and after enduring the tedious voyage across the Atlantic, with its innumerable discomforts last country, arrived at Wilmington in North Carolina,"], [295, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 275 and immediately repaired to the Scotch settlements of \" Cross Creek\" and \" Cameron's Hill.\" A strange bit of Scotland was engrafted on North Carolina. Inappropriate squatters set themselves to clear away the forest and grow rice, cotton, and tobacco. There was an odd mixture of negro Jumbos and Celtic Hectors and Hamishes. The strong traces of the feudal system which had survived in the North of Scotland might help to reconcile the new planters to slavery on its patriarchal side, but how did the strangers agree among themselves ? They were largely recruited out of the exiles and sufferers from the penalties of the '45, but there were Whig and Presbyterian elements in the medley ; for it is still remembered that Flora, her husband and family, listened to the sermons of one of their countrymen in the Presb3rterian Kirk of the little township, during their stay on the borders of civilization. These expatriated Scotch men and women, whether Whig or Tory, held out a hand of fellowship to each other in the wilds. Their minds recalled and dwelt on old associations, made dearer by distance and by the contrasts presented in this new world of sultry noons, and nights soft as balm, when the speakers met and talked under the shade of the grape-vines hanging over the rude verandahs, or beneath the groups of wild banana trees, marking the farthest limits of the settler's tenancy. The familiar speech was still of old times, old places and the old accidents of the surroundings \u2014 how many flocks of sheep perished in the last great snowdrift \u2014 how the laird of Cairnbreck sought a shorter road home by galloping his horse across the frozen loch. There was neutral ground on which all"], [296, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 276 could tread, in the humorous side of the national troubles, which the flight of a quarter of a century had robbed of much of their soreness and bitterness. In what awkward pickles many artfully divided houses had found themselves. To what desperate resources husbands and wives had been driven. There was \" the Lady of Moy,\" and the Mackintosh her husband, tbe neighbour and friend of President Forbes. He was captain of a Hanoverian regiment, and she was honorary colonel of a Jacobite troop, and what would you say to his being taken prisoner by his wife's troop, and carried before their colonel, his own lady, when she hailed him calmly, \"Your servant, Captain,\" to which he replied composedly : \"Your servant, Colonel?\" But you may be sure there was no heading or hanging of that prisoner. There was the pawky Whig wife of the Tory Laird near Amulree, who, when she could not keep him in any other way from joining the standard of Lord Perth and his brother, pressed him to take a dish of tea with her, before he set out for the wars, and contrived to \"whummle\" her kettle of boiling water into one of his riding boots, as he sat booted and spurred at her tea-table, so that there could be no question of his putting his foot to the ground till his comrades were beyond the borders. But what \" ferlie \" could rival the strange chance \u2014 it was not called \"the irony of fate\" in those days, by which Kingsbarrow's lady, Flora Milton that was, whose future husband, brother, step-father, and chief were all pledged to the Whig government, should have been the guide who took the Prince to Skye, and freed him from the toils of militia officers and captains of cutters. It is likely enough that the composite nature of"], [297, "THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 277 the Macdonalds' antecedents \u2014 the fact that the late Sir Alexander Macdonald had ranged himself on tbe side of the House of Hanover in the recent rebellion, together with his close alliance with the great Whig leader, Duncan Forbes, warmed the hearts of the Whig emigrants ; while the knowledge of what Flora had risked for their Prince, won the good will of the Jacobites \u2014 and that the two influences united to swell the popularity which the household is said to have enjoyed. In truth, foreign aids were hardly wanted to secure the favour of the mixed public. Allan Kingsbarrow carried with him, wherever he went, tbe bearing and reputation of an honourable quietly sagacious gentleman, somewhat stately in his soldierly gait, and silent in his speech, but friendly and accessible withal. Flora sat down among orange groves, melon beds, and fig trellises, instead of bracken and briar, potatoes and leeks, and fitted herself into every unfamiliar experience, with the good breeding and good humour, the pleasant tact and ease, which Dr. Johnson and Boswell had admired. She did not complain of the tropical climate so trying to Europeans. She did not fall into the pitiable bewilderment which hailed each blazing sunrise with the amazed exclamation, \" another bet day.\" She did not obstinately refuse to adapt herself to circumstances and to accept what compensations presented themselves. She readily changed her old home-spun and tartans, silk pelisses and mantles, for toilets of linen and muslin. She was not frightened at the black faces, thick lips and rolling eyes of the negroes in their cotton jackets and turbans. She had seen the black boys who were the fashionable seiwants in London, when she had paid her visits to the metropolis, she was disposed to hail"], [298, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 278 the race with a lively recollection of the interest and amusement the first specimens she had met afforded her, and to make friends with their successors. It is a great thing for any man or woman to possess the shrewd judgment, liberal fund of common sense, Christian kindness and sprightly temper which were the inheritance of Flora Macdonald. Anne Macdonald, Flora's eldest daughter, whom her father and mother called \"Nanny,\" was the chief representative of the younger generation in the absence of her brothers with their regiments and ships, and Anne was more of a regular beauty and belle than her mother had ever been. Flora had not forgotten polite Edinburgh assemblies and blythe Highland gatherings, she desired, mother like, that her daughter should not miss, in the days of her youth, the chances \u2014 not to say the delights \u2014 which belonged to her years and station. The mother set herself to appear, with a mother's pride in the loveli ness of the young girl under her wing, at the merry makings \u2014 neither unpicturesque nor undignified, the balls at the nearest Governor's house, the house warmings of shanties in the back woods, which fell to the share of the settlement. As a natural result and an agreeable distraction in that anxious introductory pause of looking about them, and making up their minds where it would be best to go, and what it would be best to do, Anne Macdonald found her mate in a Skye man, Alexander Macdonald, of Glendale, who had gone out to America before her. He was, as a matter of course, prepared to join the army recruiting in the provinces of the colony. More fortunate than many of his fellow recruits, he was drafted into a home regiment before the storm, already muttering in the"], [299, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 279 States, broke out and dealt death and destruction around. The Macdonald son-in-law with his young wife was speedily beyond defeat and failure across the seas, in the army in which he rose ultimately to the rank of Lieutenant-General. It was something else than chronic hostilities with the French, and the necessity of jealously guarding the frontier from the savage attacks of the Red Indians, which engulfed the dawning fortunes of the Macdonalds, in a whirlpool that sucked down the hopes of many another new-comer. They were stiU full of the mother-country with which they had no quarrel. They were unacquainted with the spirited history, and had no sympathy with the lawful aspirations, of the American descendants of the crew and passengers of the Mayflower, and of Raleigh's band of gallant adventurers. Not a year had elapsed for the Macdonalds to be acclimatized and naturalized, and Allan had just bought the land and log-house of Kilhegray near the northern boundary of the province, when he was drawn into the war of Independence, and that on the wrong side. The Governor of North Carolina had resolved to raise a body of Scotch Highlanders to be called the \"Royal Highland Regiment.\" Of this regiment, he offered Kingsbarrow, as a gentleman of mature years, held in general esteem, and possessed of some military experience, the command, with the rank and title of Brigadier-General. The recently settled Highlanders of whatever religious or political creed, were in this cause royalists to a man, as ready to fight for King George in America as some of them had been fain to fight for King James in Great Britain. Not only was Allan's old military fire re-awakened, the post which he accepted"], [300, "280 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" appeared, in tbe first blush of the affair, to be one of honour and profit, which his friends might well welcome for him. Flora had to make up her mind to remain alone with her younger children and servants, in the log-house, amidst the half-cultivated undrained land and strag- gling remnants of forest, destined to be the future fertile fields of Killiegray, while Allan went to the wars. It was no stealthy, cruel devils, rather than wild men, in their feathers and war-paint, who crept down and surprised Flora in the rude home she was striv- ing to make habitable and home-like, in anticipation of the husband and father's return. It was a still subtler and more relentless foe, the deadly typhus following on the track of the white man's footsteps, hovering in the miasma brooding over the stagnant fenny pools, and the rank rotting undergrowth of the half-felled clearing where the intruder had rashly promised himself the hardy sport to which he had been accustomed, in far different regions, in bringing down with his gun wild turkeys, wild ducks, etc. Poor Flora's simple medical lore and the old negro women's decoctions and incantations were unable to cope with the enemy. Within a week two of her three younger children lay dead, side by side, and Flora stood looking down at her boy and girl, in their last sleep, or, shading her weary eyes with her hand, gazed abroad in vain, in the forlorn hope of seeing the father who would never more behold them, while she alone was left to take care that they were laid decently in the mother earth, which receives her white and black children alike, without protest, into her broad bosom. The only child left with Flora was her second daughter Fanny. She was stricken also, but she"], [301, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 281 partly shook off the fever. The moment she could be moved, Flora, bowed down and broken-hearted, travelled with the little girl to the camp of the Royal Highland regiment. She thought that they might be suffered to stay with the officer in command, partly because he was their natural refuge and consolation, partly in the desperate endeavour to save a waif from the wreck, by withdrawing the sick child, for a season at least, from the pestilential environs which had proved fatal to her brother and sister. Flora did follow the camp for a few weeks, and sought to occupy herself with the soldier's man\u0153uvres and prospects. She heard much in the camp talk of one Mr. George Washington of Mount Vernon, in the neighbouring province of Virginia. He was appointed General of the rebel force, and a good deal was feared from his excellent parts, and from the calmness, courage, and military skill, which it was acknowledged he had shown, in his campaign with Craddock, against the French troops under Duchesne. It was not till Allan's regiment was in line of march at Haymount, in close proximity to the American Army, that Flora, after she had looked \"for the first and last time,\" with glistening eyes, on the pomp of glorious war, was induced to return to her desolate home. She had not long arrived at Killiegray when the disastrous tidings reached her that the Royalists had been defeated at Moor's Creek, and that Allan was taken prisoner and lodged in the common jail of Halifax, in Virginia. Flora then left her sick child, and journeyed to be near her husband, but was refused admittance to him, a prohibition which might have been removed if Washington had been within hail."], [302, "282 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" It was Allan's turn to act for his wife, even while he lay in prison. His patience and generosity came into play. Sensible of the loneliness, misery, and danger of Flora's position at KUliegray, he wrote and adjured her, as she would preserve little Fanny for him, to return straightway to Scotland, where he pledged himself to rejoin her, as soon as peace was proclaimed, whichever side won. Flora would have no lack of friends to receive her. Fanny would rally if she could but get a breath of her fresh native air, and a run among the heather. There was nothing to be gained by tbe family's continuing in America. The war had brought ruin to them, whatever else it had brought to others. All the bright hopes and fond expectations of these later emigrants, had come to an end, within three short years. By favour of a friendly American officer, Flora procured a passport which enabled her and her daughter to pass through the enemy's lines, by way of Fayetteville to Charleston, from which they sailed in 1779. 4' But think ye nae Her heart icas icae, When she turned her bach Awa' to gae,\" leaving Allan Kingsbarrow behind her ? He was by no means without the benefit of kindred, however. All his sons, whether with their regiments or ships, were engaged in the American war, and there was more possibility of the fortunes of war bringing one or more of them in contact with their father, than Flora could have hoped for in her own case ; while within a year of her quitting America, Lord Corn wallis brought his forces into the Carolinas, and aroused a passing hope that England might yet retain her monster colony."], [303, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 283 Flora was to have another adventure before she arrived in her native country. The merchant ship in which she and her young daughter sailed, was chased by a French privateer. It came near enough to threaten to rake the deck with its piece of ordnance, and to tear and set fire to the rigging with its musketry. The English merchant seamen, unaccustomed to fight save with the elements, were disinclined to come to close quarters with an armed and skilled foe. They were tempted to consider prudence the better part of valour. They proposed \u2014 if their sailing powers did not procure for them a wide berth, where their formidable assailant with which they were unequally matched, was in question \u2014 to surrender quickly rather than provoke sharp reprisals. \"What!\" cried Flora, when this determination was communicated to her, \" Yield to the French without a blow ? Never. Allan Kingsbarrow in an American jile, and Fanny and me in a French jile, what would the rest of the bairns think and do ? I must on deck. If our men see that an auld wife is not feared to face the worst, they will take heart again, and do their duty.\" She mounted the cabin stairs and looked round, undaunted, on the melee, when the indomitable little woman was thrown down in the confusion, and had an arm broken. As she was forced to retreat, she remarked with her old dry humour, that now she had fought for both the house of Stuart and the house of Hanover, and she had been worsted in each service. But her example was not without its effect. The EngUsh sailors stood to their helm, hoisted all sail, and succeeded in snatching the prey from the wolf's jaws."], [304, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 284 CHAPTER III. ;- Hame, hame, hame, Oh, hame fain wud I be ! Allan Cunningham. At last Flora was in her Hebrides again, with the wild nor'-west wTind roaring down the hillsides, lashing the lochs, and soughing through the bracken and heather, instead of the hot vapour brooding over the Carolina rice-fields. The burden and heat of the long day were past, and there remained a period of rest and peace for the brave worker before the end. The farm of Kingsbarrow happened to be in the hands of the laird, Johnson's \" Sir Sawney,\" about to be created Lord Macdonald, but even he could not deny the claims of Flora Macdonald and her family. Before Allan got his liberty at the close of the American War, his wife and daughter were reinstated in the old homestead, with its thronging memories. Flora's elder daughter was in her own house in the island, with her three children, and her Skye husband appeared on the scene when his \" leave of absence \" allowed him. Young Fanny had thrown off the slow fever which was wasting her strength, and was, as her mother gladly recorded, \"promising to be a stout Highland cailag.\" There was always the hope of one or other of the sons of the house, turning up from his regiment or his ship, and coming with a glad surprise in his hand, to the cradle of his clan and his mother's hearth. It was a great happy gathering of wife, children, grandchildren, and old friends \u2014 Milton upwards of seventy with a strapping son by his side, Malcolm"], [305, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 285 Macleod as old, still hale and ruddy, Donald Roy the Nestor of the group, with a limp of one knee as a memento of the battle of Colloden \u2014 all met on the pier of Portree \u2014 not to speed forth a fugitive Prince, but to welcome home an honest, modest gentleman, at last freed from captivity. The cares of the world no longer pressed heavily on Flora and Kingsbarrow. Their children were, with one exception, grown up and provided for. Allan had his half pay as an officer, who had seen service and suffered for it, in a regiment raised in the King's name, though it was in another hemisphere, to add to the profits of the Skye farm. The expedition to the United States had borne no other fruit, unless in such tribulation as works patience and experience. The price of Killiegray when re-sold was out-weighed by the losses and expenses which had been incurred. But there was enough and to spare for the few needs of a quiet little household, under the good manage ment of the self-respecting gentle-woman, and house mother still active and diligent, though her years had attained their three score. For the eight years which followed there might have been only tranquil content, without an appre hension for the future, for the youngest of the family, Fanny, doubly precious since she had been redeemed from the devouring typhus of the Southern State, blossomed, flourished and married, in her turn, a Skye man, as her sister had done, a Macdonald, a kinsman of her own, a soldier in that hardy nursing ground of soldiers and sailors.* * As an instance of the martial proclivities of the race, a Highland genealogist has put it on record, that within the last decade, a great great-grand-daughter of Flora Macdonald became the wife of Marshal Canrobert."], [306, "286 \"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" All was serenely bright with the chastened lustre of the lengthening shadows as the day nears its close, when a fierce storm once more swept the horizon. On a dreary morning, though the summer sun was in the sky, the news was brought to Kingsbarrow that Death, which had once before sped a twin dart to rend the parents' hearts, had again dealt a double blow more crushing than the first, against the Mac donalds of Kingsbarrow. Allan and Flora's second and third sons, Alexander and Ranald, were captains of marines ; Ranald had served with distinction under Rodney, at the taking of St. Eustatia. In another naval action the brothers, who were together, were left in charge of the French prize La ville de Paris, captured after hard fighting. The young men were true to their post, but courage and skill struggled in vain against tremendous odds. La ville de Paris, with yawning bulkhead, and starting timbers, riddled and scuttled with shot, was doomed to destruction, she sank in mid-ocean, and all on board perished. Flora's son and daughter, dead of fever at the settlement in North Carolina, were still but boy and girl in their tender, undeveloped youth, her brave sons were in their prime, \"goodly young men\" as Lorraine, seeing them in her vision, had called them, long ago. One comfort was left to Flora, her faithful husband and lifelong stay, who had been absent during the calamity in America, without even the power to return and bury his dead, stood by her side and com forted her in this later and more bitter catastrophe. He taught her to restrain a mother's outspoken anguish, lest she should add to a father's silent grief. In 1788, the announcement of the death of Prince"], [307, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 287 Charles Edward Stuart reached the far north. He had outlived his romantic adventures in Scotland forty years, during which no token of his remem brance was ever vouchsafed to his deliverer in his hour of need. It is not necessary to state here that he had survived all honourable reputation. His wretched quarrels with the unhappy and erring young Princess, with whom he made an ill-assorted marriage late in life, put the finishing touch to his degradation, even in the eyes of his most zealous partisans, and loyal, broken-hearted followers. His star which had shone in youth with much splendour of charm, was quenched in the sullen waters of growing mental and physical ignominy. In order to acknowledge the truth of the statement, let any impartial person compare the pictures of Prince Charles taken in his heyday, with those painted of him after the brutal scenes in Florence and Rome. He died and was buried, as everybody knows, in Rome, under the protection of the Pope, with the proud title of Charles III. King of Great Britain and Ireland, which he never bore in life, inscribed on his tomb. There is no record of the impression which the Prince's death produced on Flora Macdonald, but one can imagine her profound pity for the lament able fate of bonnie Prince Charlie. The popular delusion that she was from the beginning, and continued to the end, an ardent Jacobite, has singularly little to support it. All her maiden antecedents point to the reverse conclusion. Later each of her sons entered, betimes, into the service of King George. Her husband, both in his early and in his more mature days, drew pay as an officer in the army, under the Whig government."], [308, "\"THE MACDONALD L.4SS.\" 288 In opposition to these solid proofs, there are the dramatic accidents of the white roses in Flora's hair and bosom in her picture, and of the shroud in which she was buried. There are also certain family legends that she boxed the ears of one of her boys for speaking of Prince Charles as \"the Pretender,\" and sharply rebuked another son for calling George III. during the lifetime of his grandfather, \" the Prince of Wales,\" while she contented herself with styling him \" Saft Geordie.\" If there is any foundation for this ancient and fishy gossip, it seems to have more to do with the ready wit and the humorous side \u2014 than with the political opinions \u2014 of a woman whose integrity was never doubted. And never so far as we can find, did Flora Macdonald speak of the assistance she rendered the Prince in the light of her duty to the son of her lawful sovereign, as a Jacobite would have put it, she treated it simply as a favour granted to her friends, and an act of humanity performed for a man in distress. Flora Macdonald survived Charles Edward two years. She died in the Spring of 1790 at the same age of sixty-eight. She did not die in her own house of Kingsbarrow, she was on a visit, in her usual health, to old friends at their house of Penduin on the coast of Skye, three miles distant from her home, when she was seized with her sudden fatal illness. Her nearest relatives within reach were soon around her. She calmly breathed her last, in the presence of her husband and their two daughters, on the 5th of March. She was in full possession of her faculties, with \"her spirit, sense, and goodness\" unbroken and unabated. The portion of the sheet in which the Prince had slept during the night he spent at Kingsbarrow, which"], [309, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 289 Flora had carried with her to America, and brought back that it might fulfil the purpose for which it was destined, was fetched from her house, and she was shrouded in it and \"chested.\" It was resolved that her body, in its chest or coffin, should be conveyed over-night from Penduin to Kingsbarrow, where it might Ue in rustic state, awaiting an imposing funeral. In spite of the earliness of the season there was a wild tempest of thunder, lightning, and rain, like the summer storm which beset the boat that took Flora and the Prince to Skye. Nevertheless, a party of twelve stalwart Highlanders set out to carry the coffin, and the sleeper within, shoulder high, with all the honour which could be shown, notwithstanding the intervals of pitch-darkness between the lightning flashes, and in spite of the fact that the country to be traversed was without a regular road, bridge, or ford, while the river Himsdale was \" swollen from bank to bank.\" The aged and sorrow- stricken widower had been induced to return to his desolate house in the course of the day. Flora's three surviving sons were far away. That one of her sons-in-law who was conduct ing the mournful procession was driven to hesitate, and weU-nigh to yield to a discreet suggestion, made in the face of the difficulties which presented them selves, that the body of the lady should be taken back to Penduin, at least to await daylight, to enable the bearers to remove their burden, without the risk of ghastly misadventure and loss of life. But a fiery young Highlander stood out from the group, and spoke the mind of the majority when he cried indignantly, \"No, sir, her own self must not give in ; she who lies there never turned aside for a u"], [310, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 290 lion in her path. Do not bring upon us the shame, whatever, of causing Flora, daughter of Ranald, to turn back on her road.\" Then the bearers, with one consent, took up their burden, resumed their progress, and by foUowing the course of the river, and daringly crossing it, with the water breast- deep where it spread wide on the strand, close to the beach, the task was accomplished. If Flora Macdonald's wedding was the greatest festivity of its kind seen in Skye, her funeral was a yet more notable demonstration. Her long life had not tarnished her fame or caused it to dwindle away. Her body, in its coffin, was visited and viewed with reverence and affection by many hundreds of her country people. There is a startling tradition still extant in the Skye parish that no less than three hundred gallons of whisky (no doubt with oat-cakes, bannocks of barley, and cheese in proportion) were served out on the day of the funeral, for the refresh ment of the multitude of mourners. The funeral train was a mile in length as it travelled the sixteen miles to the vault in the Kirk yard of Kilmuir, which already held the coffins of old Kingsbarrow and his wife. At the head of the company walked twelve pipers from the Macrimmon and Macarthur colleges, playing the coronach, Lord Macdonald's piper stepping first, and blowing the shrillest blast. The chief mourner was an old man \u2014 solitary, though a pace or two behind him the dead woman's sons-in-law, grandsons, nephews, kindred in the most distant degree crowded, in order to proclaim the link between her and them. Thus on the bleak March morning, across the wind-swept moors the great procession wended its"], [311, "\"THE MACDONALD LASS.\" 291 way slowly, with the pipers droning and shrieking, and the concourse of emotional Celtic people weeping and wailing, as Flora Macdonald was borne to her last resting-place. In Flora Macdonald we realize the old Hebrew ideal \u2014 ' ' Strength and honour are her clothing, and she shall rejoice in time to come. \"She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. \" She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. \" Her children arise up, and call her blessed ; her husband also, and he praiseth her.\" the end.
