The eldest, a pretty, dark girl, was just seventeen, while the other, aged twelve, bore a strong family likeness to her brother. Five years before the date of my story, the children had had the great misfortune to lose their mother. Lord Grantown, though he had loved his wife dearly, was not a man to wear his heart on his sleeve ; and she, poor lady, mistaking his somewhat stern manner for indifference, had expended the wealth of her affections on her children. To all of them her death was a bitter blow. Helen had been of an age to feel it acutely, added to which, she had been her mother's constant companion ; while Lina, as the youngest, had of course been the spoilt pet of the mistress of the house. As for Lord Grantown, he was a man not altogether undeserving of notice. He was tall and thin, with iron grey hair, dark, piercing eyes, and a slight stoop. Though he was a man greatly given to speaking, and with much of the orator about him, he had taken no part in political life. He was never absent from his"], [13, "Home Life. \u2022 11 place in the Upper House, but he never opened his lips when there, unless an ecclesiastical question was being discussed. Then, though he spoke eloquently, \u2014 so eloquently that he was never at a loss for a word, \u2014 he yet influenced no one. His quarrel was not with this or that party, but rather with the whole bench of bishops. He was for ever prophesying the instant destruction of the Church of England before the great wave of infidelity, unless some pet plan of his own was at once adopted. It was useless to point out that in the past such theory had been acted upon and failed. What matter though 'they had toiled all the night, taking nothing ; ' the burden of his cry was, ' Let down the net once again.' This, however, must be done according to his express directions. Poor Lord Grantown ! it was not all his own fault. His mother had been a Scotchwoman, and a member of a sect but little known in these days, and from his earliest years he had been instilled in her somewhat gloomy doctrines until he had grown up and adopted them as his own. He never laughed, because he was ever thinking of serious things, and laughter to him"], [14, "Wrong on both Sides. 12 was frivolous. He never shot or hunted like other men, or followed their pursuits. To him God and the things of God were all in all. So, though many thought him harsh and cold, yet on the whole he was a good man, and ever strove to act up to his principles. His wife's death made but little outward change in him, since he believed that the exhibition of sorrow was not permitted to the man who strove to follow the divine will ; so, even while his heart was wrung, none guessed it. Such was the master of the castle at the date of my story. But, of all the household, none had felt Lady Gran town's death like her son Tempeston. The day before her decease, having given birth to a boy who survived but a few hours, she was taken alarmingly ill. Towards nightfall, the ordinary medical man, Dr. Tufnell, had requested that Sir William M'Bean might be sent for from London, and Lord Grantown, a man much averse to alarm and excitement under any circumstances, had striven to oppose his wish. He said he was quite satisfied that Dr. Tufnell would do all that was necessary, and that he had every confidence in him."], [15, "Home Life. 13 Then it became necessary to break to the husband the country practitioner's fears, and the former, seeing how serious matters were, gave way. Coming in, full of joyous carelessness, Tempeston had met the servant bearing the telegraphic despatch to the station, and in a moment seemed to realize the calamity with which he was threatened. Panting for breath, in his thick, muddy boots, in two minutes he was outside his mother's door. There he was stopped \u2014 he could not go in. He would \u2014 he must ; no one should prevent him. His old nurse had her arms round him, and was seeking to drag him away, when Lord Grantown came out to see what the disturbance was about. He was ashamed of such violence at such a time, he said, and ordered his son sternly from his presence. Then with flashing eyes the boy refused. ' Let me pass ! ' he cried ; ' I will go in. She will see me ; I will make her better.' ' Your mother is unconscious,' Lord Grantown retorted. ' I order you to be quiet. Go to your room and remain there without your tea as a punishment for not obeying me at once.'"], [16, "Wrong on both Sides. 14 The warm, passionate heart, bursting with terror at the idea of his mother's danger, could ill stand rebuke at such a moment. He flung himself from his old nurse, and strove to wrestle his way past his father. Lord Grantown caught him by the collar and half dragged, half carried the lad to the latter's own room. ' You will remain here till to-morrow morning,' he said, preparing to quit the apartment. Half mad, the boy struck out at the speaker, receiving in return a ringing box on the ear. Then followed a terrible scene ; Tempeston fought with all his might, not heeding the blows showered on him, while Lord Grantown, though a strong man, had to do his best against his son. At length the elder prevailed, and flung the boy from him, bruised, to the floor. ' Lie there,' he said, ' you bad, wicked child ! Is it at such an hour as this you would show your violence, when your mother may be dying ? ' ' Curse you ! ' Tempeston hissed through his clenched teeth ; ' I wish that you were dying. I hate you ! ' Through the night that followed, the lad remained locked into the room without food or comfort. He"], [17, "Home Life. 15 never slept. Now pacing the apartment from end to end, now flinging himself weeping on his bed, he waited for the arrival of the doctor who should bring help. At length, towards morning, he heard the sound of wheels, and, looking out, beheld the carriage driving up to the door. Sir William M'Bean had come by special train, but he had come too late. It was close on five o'clock when the sound of the key turning roused the lad from a half doze. He opened his eyes to see his old nurse. In an instant Tempeston was in her arms. ' How was mammy ? What did the doctors say ? When would she be better ? ' The woman held him in her arms. The house was still and quiet. There was no reply \u2014 yet her silence gave him answer, and with a cry the lad fell senseless at her feet. The doctor came, and lingered round his bed, but it was some days before the boy recovered consciousness. In after life Tempeston never forgot the day and hour when his senses returned. For a time he had a difficulty in recalling events. There was a stir and bustle within the house just then, and he could hear"], [18, "Wi ong on both Sides. 16 the sound of hoofs and wheels below his window. He lifted himself from his pillow with a moan, as the knowledge of the past came back to him, when sud denly the tread of many feet outside his door startled him- Who were they ? How slowly they came ! Every now and then they paused, as though they bore some heavy weight ! He rose, staggered to the window, and, peeping out, beheld, waiting at the steps, a carriage with feathers on the top which nodded in the wintry wind. And so seeing, the boy knew what it was that had been borne past his bedroom door. It was five years since then, but, even at the date of the opening of my story, Tempeston had never learned to speak of his mother. The girls liked to talk with old nurse about ' her dear mistress,' but if the young heir's step was heard approaching, a sudden hush fell on them all lest he should hear. ' If ever there was an unlucky beggar, I am one ! ' ' What's the matter, Tempest ? ' asked Lina, looking up from the table where she was copying a French exercise."], [19, "Home Life. 17 'Why, papa says I'm not to go back to Eton next half; not to go back at all.' ' Goodness me ! why not ? ' He says he's had a correspondence with Mr. Beatson, who, it seems, must needs go writing to him that I was idle, or something of that sort, \u2014 as if a fellow could be always sapping, \u2014 so I'm to stop at home and have a tutor.' ' A tutor ! ' echoed both the girls in amazement. ' Yes. He says that he's going to superintend the lessons himself, and see that I work.' ' Good heavens ! ' exclaimed Helen ; ' what dreadful scrapes you will get into, Tempest ! I know what it will be, \u2014 simply endless rowing from morning till night between you both.' ' It won't be my fault if there's not, I can tell you. I'll lead him such a life that he'll rue the day he took me away from Eton. Here am I to go to London with you in May, stop there all the season, and have no cricket or anything ! I hate him. I always did and shall ; but now I hate him more than ever ! ' 'But, Tempest,' returned Lina, 'you won't mind"], [20, "Wrong on both Sides. 18 staying with us after a bit. I will do all your sums for you, and Helen can always translate your French.' ' Oh, it's not that I mind. I shan't trouble very much about lessons. If I don't know them, what can he do ? He dare not strike me now. The last time he tried that game was two years ago, and if he thinks at my age ' \u2014 speaking very loftily \u2014 ' that I shall con sent to have my ears boxed by him, why, then, he's very much mistaken, that's all.' Helen could not help smiling at the speaker's ' my age.' ' I don't see why you should grin,' retorted her brother, settling himself more comfortably on the sofa ; ' you are only two years older than I am, and yet you are going to be presented next month, and call yourself grown up ! ' Long experience had taught the schoolroom party that it was best not to contradict Tempeston. Yet, with all his faults of temper and boyish conceit, the lad was a prime favourite, not only with his sisters, but with Miss Emmett, the governess, and all the estab lishment."], [21, "Home Life. 19 ' Does papa know of a tutor ? ' asked Helen, changing the subject. ' No ; he's going to look out for one after we go to London on the first of May. ' All that I know at present is that he is to be a man of papa's views.' ' Good heavens ! no ! ' exclaimed the elder girl. 'A fact' 'And do you mean he'll live in the house, and be at luncheon, and everything, just like Miss Emmett ? ' ' I suppose so.' ' Good-bye, then, to any fun up here at tea-time,' said Lina. ' Oh, I don't think he'll come to that. He will have dinner with papa, I suppose, or else alone.' ' Well, it's been dull enough this afternoon till now, but I must say, Tempest, you have brought us some news,' said Helen. 'Wait a minute, old girl,' was the reply, 'and I'll tell you some more. Lina, just put that cushion over there under my head ; it's too low \u2014 thanks. Well, Helen, until he finds the man, very likely he's ' \u2014 speaking in a"], [22, "Wrong on both Sides. 20 tone partly filled with awe and partly with hardly suppressed fun \u2014 ' he's going to teach me himself.' ' What ! ' 'No!' ' It's as true as true can be.' ' Oh, Tempest ! ' ' It will be \" Oh, Tempest ! \" I expect. And listen : I'm to sit with him in the library every day from ten till one, and two till four, working all the time.' ' Poor boy ! ' exclaimed both the girls, in a tone of the deepest commiseration. At this moment the door opened, and Miss Emmett, the governess, entered the room. She was a lady in appearance as well as by birth. Her father had been a fox-hunting parson, and her mother the daughter of a post-captain in the navy. Well read, anxious to educate her pupils to the best of her ability, and of a kindly nature, she was a prime favourite, not only with her motherless charges, but also with all the servants of the establishment. The girls were allowed six weeks' holiday in the autumn, and a month at Christmas, and in old times Miss Emmett had delighted to spend"], [23, "Home Life. 21 those brief seasons of rest either with friends or touring on the Continent. Since, however, the September pre vious to Lady Grantown's death she had never been absent from her pupils for a single night. They had their usual vacations and the governess put away the lesson-books, and turned into a holiday-maker herself, but still she remained at their side. She was never in the way on these occasions, but spent herself in making the time of rest happy. ' I declare,' she began, as soon as she caught sight of the boy's figure on the sofa, ' young people know how to make themselves comfortable nowadays ; don't they, Helen ? ' ' He's spent the last twenty minutes of our prepara tion time there; and, Miss Emmett, make him tell you what he has told us.' ' What is it, Tempest ? ' asked the lady, seating her self in a chair near the sofa and sweeping the boy's curly locks from his forehead. Lying luxuriously at full length and looking up at Miss Emmett with an expression half regretful at having to leave Eton, and half mirthful at the idea of"], [24, "Wrong on both Sides. 22 being partly educated by his father, the lad related his story. ' Help to teach you himself!' repeated the governess. ' Yes.' 'My dear boy, you'll get into serious trouble I'm afraid.' ' Can't help it,' retorted Tempeston. ' I didn't propose or want it. I suppose he begins to find he cannot live without me.' Every one laughed, including Miss Emmett. ' But it seems such a pity he should leave Eton,' said the last-named lady, speaking in rather a low tone to the eldest girl. ' Your father does do such sudden things. I wish he had consulted me. I never even knew Mr. Beatson had written about Tempest' ' Nor any one else until this afternoon. He met Tempest in the hall and told him, a propos of nothing.' ' Really ! ' ' Yes,' said the boy. ' I had just dashed down the grand stairs, \u2014 fancy, if he had seen me ! \u2014 and as I was walking across the hall he came out of the library and"], [25, "Hume Life. 23 said, \" Tempest, you will not return to Eton again.\" You might have knocked me down with a feather, \u2014 I was so taken aback, partly at that and partly at being so nearly caught on the stairs.' ' I hope you will try and please him more when you work with him, Tempest,' said Miss Emmett. ' But now, my dear, you must be off,' she added, as the young viscount tried to prevent a cushion falling from under his head without fatiguing himself by lifting his hands. ' Oh, why ? I'm so comfortable.' ' Lina will never finish her lessons by tea-time if you stay here talking.' 'All right ! only do let's have it punctually. I'm so awfully thirsty ! ' ' Very well ; run along now,' was the reply. Tempeston struggled up from among the cushions and quitted the room with a rather thoughtful air. He was wondering what on earth he should do with himself for the next quarter of an hour. Down the corridor he went, until he came to the head of the grand stairs. The schoolroom party were not sup posed to make use of these, but, instead, were under"], [26, "Wrong on both Sides. 24 orders always to go down the back way. Now this back way was much frequented by housemaids carrying brooms, which articles they from time to time left lying about \u2014 thereby furnishing useful weapons for Tempeston to pursue and torment his sisters with. The boy was apt to boast that he could get almost anything he wanted out of Helen by the mere threat of brushing her hair with one of the aforesaid mops. The shrieks which echoed through the house on these occasions had once or twice been heard by Lord Grantown, and had brought that gentleman to the spot, greatly to the discomfort of the principal parties engaged. Tempeston stood leaning over the rails at the head of the grand stairs, listening to the tick-tick, tick-tick of the clock, and wishing for Helen, that he might make her walk down the forbidden way, when his eye suddenly fell on a large india-rubber ball which he had mislaid, and now found lying on a table beside him. He seized the lost toy and began throwing it up into the air and catching it. This amusement occupied a few minutes, and then"], [27, "Home Lije. 25 began to pall. It was not sufficiently exciting. To thoroughly enjoy a thing, Tempeston required that there should be a certain amount of risk about it. Suddenly the idea struck him of pitching the ball against the opposite wall with sufficient force to make it rebound back to the landing-place ; if it failed to do so, it would go down the well of the staircase, which would necessitate his going after it. The fear of its doing so, and of his father catching him as he crept down, lent the required flavour to the new pastime. One, two, three, four, backwards and forwards went the ball, and each time Tempeston caught it easily ; but the fifth time, either from carelessness, or the sudden sound of the tea-bell ringing distracting his attention, he did not send it hard enough. The ball struck the wall lightly and then disappeared down the well of the stairs, followed by a sound of broken glass. 'Death and destruction! what's gone now?' exclaimed the boy, peering over the rails, when the sound of a footstep in the hall made him start. He knew whose it was. ' Good gracious ! he's come in irom his walk, and is c"], [28, "Wrong on both Sides. 26 going to the library ! ' thought the lad. ' I must wait till after tea before I dare go down and see what it is. He'll be up-stairs perhaps by then.' Tempeston dashed away to the schoolroom, where he found the party gathered round the board, on which was spread cold beef, tea, toast, jam, bread, and eggs. Tempeston was soon hard at work. Indeed, they all did full justice to the good things, while laughter and fun were the order of the day. The boy, having related the accident with the india rubber ball amidst general exclamations of horror and dread, was just engaged in a friendly argument with Lina as to whether she had or had not taken two helps of strawberry jam to his one, when a knock came to the door. No one heard it. ' You did. I saw you take it. I remember noticing how you stuck the spoon well in, so as to get double.' ' Oh, Tempest ' (getting very red), ' what a story ! ' ' It's not a story. I never have anything to eat up here unless you are late, and I happen to get a start' Again the knock. This time Miss Emmett heard it."], [29, "Home Life. 27 ' Come in ! ' The door opened, and there appeared 'his lordship's man,' Dutton, who had never in his life before had occasion to visit the schoolroom party. Every one stared, while Tempeston sat with the jam-spoon in his hand, gazing wildly at the new arrival. He thought it was a summons for him. ' His lordship's compliments, and Lady Helen was to dine with him at eight o'clock.' ' Good gracious ! ' from the last-named individual. ' Dear me ! ' from Miss Emmett. ' Oh, Helen ! ' from Lina. ' My stars, what swells we are ! ' from the holder of the jam-spoon, thinking that the above was the whole of the message, when his hopes were rudely broken by Dutton turning towards him, saying, \u2014 ' Will you please step down, my lord, to the library, and see his lordship at once ? ' The boy groaned and dropped the spoon, while murmurs of sympathy were heard on all sides. ' ile said at once, my lord,' urged the kindly valet. ' It's all UP!' exclaimed Tempeston, laughing in"], [30, "28 Wrong on both Sides. spite of his fright, as they rose from the table, and he withdrew towards the door. ' How did he look, Dutton ? ' he asked ; ' nice ? ' ' N \u2014 not very, my lord,' was the reply. Miss Emmett, who heard it, said grace with difficulty."], [31, "CHAPTER II HELEN'S FIRST DINNER. cj||jl5|ypT was with a beating heart that Tempeston K|\u00bbw\u20ac|\u00a3 descended the stairs in obedience to his father's summons. He pushed open the swing door and entered the hall, half-expecting to find Lord Grantown there, as that gentleman was some times in the habit of walking up and down the length of his own room, the lobby, and the apartment in which the boy stood. The hall of the castle was the one really magnificent thing about the house. It was of immense height, with two galleries, one above the other, running round it. The doors of the principal sleeping chambers opened into these galleries ; but, as visitors had been rarely 29"], [32, "Wrong on both Sides. 30 invited since Lady Grantown's death, they were but little used. On the north and south sides of the hall were two fireplaces, just then empty and uncomfortable looking ; for the month was April and the weather mild for the time of year. On the walls hung enor mous family pictures, while in niches here and there old muskets were arranged in semi-circular groups, together with other weapons of by-gone times. In the centre of the apartment was a great oak table, said once to have been the property of Charles the First, and consequently an object of much veneration to arch\u00e6ologists. After pausing for a moment, the boy pursued his way to the library, and, opening the door, went in. Before the fire stood the master of the house, whom I have already described to my readers. He did not move when his son entered, but, fixing his piercing gaze upon him, silently regarded him. ' Well, papa ? ' said the boy at last, pertly. ' What is the meaning of this, sir ? ' The meaning of what, papa ? ' ' You know very well, sir. How many times have I"], [33, "H lens First Dinner. 31 told you I would not have you on the grand stairs, much less playing there with a cricket ball.' The boy burst out laughing. ' A what, papa ? ' he exclaimed. ' A ball, sir ! What do you mean by such conduct as this \u2014 laughing in my very face ? ' ' Papa, I couldn't help it ; you called it a cricket ball' ' I don't care what it is. Step out into the lobby, and see the mischief you have done there first, and then come back.' The boy obeyed, and returned in a minute, looking much relieved. 'Why, papa,' he said, 'it's only a stupid old lamp chimney. I thought I had smashed something worth fifty pounds, at least.' ' Do you suppose I am going to put up with having every lamp glass smashed in the house? Besides which, that is but a part of the damage you have done. Look here at this which was standing on the slab. Do you know that it cost a guinea ? ' Lord Grantown held out a Bohemian flower-"], [34, "2 Wrong 011 both Sides. 32 vase which had been split in two. Tempeston's face fell. ' Oh, papa, I am so sorry ! I forgot all about the things on the slab when I was playing with the ball.' ' Forgot ! You had no business there, and no busi ness to forget. I will give you a punishment which shall teach you to remember. How much of your pocket-money have you spent this month ? ' ' Fifteen shillings.' ' Then you have one pound five left. Go up-stairs and bring me down a guinea of it. I mean that you shall pay for this vase.' ' Oh, papa, I can't ! ' ' What ! ' ' Papa, it's Helen's birthday on the 27th, and I have told her what I am going to give her. It's to cost seventeen and six. If you take a guinea away I shall not have money enough to pay for it.' ' It will be a part of your punishment, and will also teach you the salutary lesson that wrong committed too often brings trouble on the innocent as well as the guilty'"], [35, "Helens First Dinner. 33 ' But, papa, I have told her I am going to give it, and she will be so disappointed. I will pay this out of next month's pocket-money.' ' You will do what I tell you, sir. Go and fetch me that guinea at once.' ' I won't,' stamping his foot. 'Sir!' ' It's a great shame \u2014 a beastly shame \u2014 and ' \u2014 ' Obey me at once ! ' thundered Lord Grantown. ' If I hear one more word, you will forfeit your pocket money for the rest of the year.' Knowing that his father was apt to keep his promise, and not wishing to be left in a destitute condition for eight months, the boy departed. In a few minutes he returned to the library, where he flung the whole twenty-five shillings on the table with a sulky air. ' Less noise, Tempest,' said Lord Grantown gravely. ' What is this ? I only require a guinea. You can keep the other four shillings.' ' I don't want the beastly things,' retorted the boy. ' What's the use of so ur shillings ? ' and he strode away, banging the door behind him."], [36, "Wrong on both Sides. 34 Fortunately the dressing-bell ringing prevented Lord Grantown from sending for his son, as he would other wise have felt it his bounden duty to do. He allowed the matter to drop. ' Oh, Helen ! ' exclaimed Tempeston, meeting his sister in the hall a minute or two before eight o'clock the same evening, \u2014 ' Oh, Helen ! it was a guinea vase I smashed this afternoon, and he has taken my money to pay for it, and now I won't have enough to get you the velvet frame I promised on the 27th. Is it not a shame?' The boy's disappointment was so plainly written on his handsome young face, that the girl was more pained for his sake than for the loss of the promised picture case. ' Never mind, Tempest,' she said, kissing him. ' You shall give it me some other day, when you are rich.' ' Oh, I will, Helen. I mean to give it you next month ; only it's not the same as the 27th, is it ? ' ' Yes, it is, and better. On my birthday I shall have"], [37, "Helens First Dinner. 35 so many presents to look at, I should not be able to do justice to the frame ; now, when it comes singly, I shall only have the one thing to admire.' ' How good you are, Helen,' said the boy ; ' you always try to comfort one. Listen ! there's the warning bell. Oh, do you think you will go in to dinner arm in-arm ? ' ' I don't know.' ' Oh, I must see it, if you do. Look, I'll get behind those old muskets in the niche over there.' ' No, for goodness' sake, don't ! He might see you. Tempest, I beg you won't ! ' ' I will. Shut up ! It will be the greatest sport out. There's the gong, \u2014 I have only a second.' Before Helen could say another word he was off, and she saw the slight, graceful figure easily swing itself up and wriggle away behind the musty weapons of the past. With a beating heart the girl entered her father's room. The apartment looked extremely comfortable, with its numerous bookcases, well stocked with volumes, deep leather arm-chairs, sofas, reading-lamps, rugs, and other appliances of modern civilisation, the whole being"], [38, "Wrong on both Sides. 36 lighted up by a great blazing fire on the hearth, near which Lord Grantown was standing. You are late,' he said. Not above a second, I think,' Helen replied quickly. ' A second may make all the difference. If you were going to Australia, and arrived a second after the ship had weighed anchor, you would find, very properly find, that it made a change, and a disagreeable change too, in all your plans.' ' Yes, papa. I \u2014 I will try to be more exact another time.' The girl answered almost wildly, scarcely knowing what it was she was saying, as the recollection came to her that the niche containing the muskets must be passed before the dining-room could be reached. ' If he offers his arm we are lost,' she thought. ' Tempest never will see us go by like that without laughing.' ' Dinner, my lord,' said the butler. Yes, he had ! there was absolutely no choice. He put out his arm, and she was bound to take it. Down the apartment and out into the hall they went. The"], [39, "Helens First Dinner. 37 double doors leading into the dining-room were open, and Helen saw the wax-lights burning, and servants waiting, while there was the niche and1 the muskets, by which they were bound to pass. In the silence the girl fancied she heard a suppressed laugh, and glanced nervously at her father; but he did not appear to have noticed anything. She looked across, dreading that the boy should have left an arm or leg exposed to view, but there was nothing to be seen. ' Perhaps he's gone away,' she thought. She little knew what was to come. They reached the centre of the hall \u2014 were equal with the niche \u2014 had passed it safely by \u2014 when some thing cold touched Helen's neck. The boy, monkey like, had stretched out his arm, and tapped his sister on the neck with his fingers.

' exclaimed Lord Grantown, frightened and astonished at a sound so unusual in his presence, and dropping her arm."], [40, "Wrong on both Sides. 38 ' N \u2014 nothing,' she stammered. ' Nothing ! I repeat, why did you scream ? ' ' Something cold on my neck. It's gone now ; just like a spider, you know.' ' I don't know,' retorted her father, stepping forward alone; 'and I hope for the future you will learn to control yourself better. Suppose it had been a spider, what then ? Is there anything revolting in one of the most marvellous insects in creation ? ' ' It made me jump, papa, that was all,' answered the girl, seating herself where, in days of old, her dead mother used to sit. ' Oh dear ! I wonder if mamma quite liked dining with papa ? ' she thought. Lord Grantown did not wish to scold his daughter the first time she had ever dined tete-a-tete with him ; so he settled himself to his soup without further reference to the affair. When he had finished, he looked across at Helen, as though expecting her to make some remark. She caught his glance and realized the meaning, \u2014 but that was all.

The colour mounted to her cheeks, and she grew hotter and hotter the longer the silence lasted. ' I should not mind the spiders, if he would start them again,' she thought, 'only I can't go back to them, I suppose. Good gracious ! if he should want me to dine with him every night ! ' ' Have you seen your brother this evening ? ' asked Lord Grantown, at last, to Helen's great relief, breaking the awful silence. ' Yes.' ' When ? ' ' At tea, papa, and \u2014 and since. ' He told you, perhaps, that I had been speaking to him ? ' ' Yes, papa.' ' I have reflected over the matter, and had con siderable correspondence with his tutor and form master.

' There are things of greater importance than mere sports. He must learn these things. He has been idle, grossly idle ; and I can see, too, that he has no sense of religion ; even this very morning he was smiling when I was reading to you all of the children mocking the bald-headed prophet.' ' But, papa, he is only a boy.' ' And are boys to be permitted to ridicule the Word of God ? ' ' Oh, papa, he would not, indeed he would not ! I think, perhaps, you do not quite \u2014 quite understand Tempest.' ' Not understand ! a parent not understand his own child ! ' ' Papa, I think not about this.

Is his \u2014 his temper as violent as ever ? ' ' He can be very angry, papa ; perhaps not quite so often as he used to be.' 'The Easter vacation is short,' Lord Grantown answered, 'and until to-day I have seen but little of him ; even then he was sulky because I was obliged to punish him.' ' He was greatly disappointed, poor boy, because the punishment prevented his giving me a birthday present. Papa, I think he is the most generous boy I ever heard of. He always spends nearly the whole of his pocket-money on every one but himself. He is sorry not to go back to Eton, too ; perhaps that was what made him seem a little sulky. Do you think it is quite a wise decision, papa ? ' D"], [44, "Wrong on both Sides. 42 ' Helen ! ' Papa, I only spoke because I thought it best. Of course you will decide as you think right. I fancy Miss Emmett thought it a pity also.' ' I will see Miss Emmett. What does the boy do with himself at home ? ' ' He rides in the afternoon, and spends some of his time at the stables. He is fond of horses.' ' A dangerous taste for a young fellow of his stamp. I must put a stop to that ! ' ' Good gracious ! what have I done ? ' thought the unhappy Helen. ' I do not think it does him any harm,' she ventured to suggest. ' I am the best j udge of that,' Lord Grantown returned. There was a silence for a while, as the servants cleared away and placed the dessert on the table, while the girl wondered how long she ought to sit, and whether her companion would tell her when to go. ' You do not eat much dinner,' Lord Grantown remarked, as Helen refused fruit and biscuits. ' Papa, I had tea at half-past five.'"], [45, "Helens First Dinner. 43 ' What ! schoolroom tea ? ' Yes. I did not know I was to dine with you, till just as we were finishing.' 'I forgot to send earlier. For the future, Helen, you will, of course, both here and in London dine with me.' The girl with difficulty repressed a groan. Farewell tea, toast, and jam ! Farewell to the merry schoolroom fun ! Oh, what good times they had had up there ! What absurd scenes, when Tempest had set them playing 'hunt the slipper,' \u2014 the whole party only consisting of herself, Lina, Miss Emmett, and old nurse. Lord Grantown sipped his claret in silence for a little while ; but at length he said, ' I have arranged that your Aunt Harriet shall present you on the fifth.' ' Yes, papa. I heard from her this morning ; she says she has not been to court for fifteen years.' ' Well, it is but a piece of worldly vanity, and I regret you should have to undertake it. I only yielded to your Uncle William's wishes.' ' But, papa, a great many \u2014 I mean \u2014 does not every"], [46, "Wromr on both Sides. 44 one eo to court ? I am sure I have seen the Arch bishop of Canterbury's name at the levees.' ' And is he less likely to do wrong than other men ? My experience teaches me very differently. Time was when our bishops were a godly race, but of late things have sadly changed. There is no worldly amusement you will not find patronized by some one of them, on the score of prudence and concession.' ' Good gracious ! I have done it now ! ' thought Helen. ' I must start something else quickly.' ' Papa, who will Tempest have to play with him when we come back from London ? It has always been that in his autumn holidays he is rather tired of cricket, after the long summer term, but now it will be different' 'He has chosen to be idle, and must abide the consequence.'

' When do you expect a tutor for him, papa ? ' ' Not till we are in town. I have my eye on a man who I think would suit.' ' Is he young, papa ? ' ' About thirty-five, and much of my own way of thinking. He will repress any tendencies to so-called modern thought which the boy may have picked up at Eton.' Helen laughed, and Lord Grantown looked at her in unfeigned astonishment. ' Papa, you must please excuse me. I don't believe Tempest even knows the meaning of the words \"free thought.\" ' ' You can go now,' was the freezing reply. Helen rose, and Lord Grantown held the door open for her. She did not know whether to thank him or not, yet she could hardly make up her mind to pass by without a word. Bow ? It was absurd to bow. It ended in her quitting the apartment with an inane smile on her countenance."], [48, "Wrong on both Sides. 46 The first person the girl met in the hall was Tem peston. He greeted her with a triumphant yell, such as a Red Indian might indulge in on beholding a vanquished enemy. ' T-ch, t-ch ! papa will hear you ! ' exclaimed Helen, in agony. ' I can't help it ; I shall laugh whenever I think of it. When you got into the dining-room I lay down there on the rug and thought I should have died.' 'It was very naughty. I'll never forgive it,' ex claimed Helen, the remembrance of her sufferings rising vividly before her. ' You would if you knew what trouble I took over it. My goodness ! I don't know how I got back behind the old things. If they had not been fastened so strongly to the wall we should all have come down with a run.' ' Serve you right if you had,' retorted Helen. ' What did he say ? ' nodding his head in the direction of the dining-room. ' Asked what it was, of course.'"], [49, "Helens First Dinner. 47 ' Oh, I heard that ; but afterwards ? ' ' I said it felt like a spider. If I had thought I might have told the truth, and said a young monkey.' The boy laughed. ' Well ? ' ' Oh, then he said something about spiders being created, I think.' ' That's quite true,' Tempeston answered ; ' and now tell me, what did you talk about all dinner ? ' ' I have a good mind not to say. It's more than you deserve. We talked of you and you only. Oh no, I forgot,' \u2014 with an evident desire, by strict truthfulness, to atone for the spider falsehood, \u2014 ' we talked of you and the Archbishop of Canterbury.' ' Me and the Archbishop ! ' exclaimed the boy, open ing his blue eyes wide in astonishment. 'Yes.' ' But why ? I never even saw an archbishop, that I know of, in my life.' 'No, I'm only joking. He did speak about him once, but the rest of the time he talked about you.' ' What did he say ? ' rather anxiously.

Hem\u2014 well, as you are up, you can come to"], [51, "Heleiis First Dinner. 49 the library with your sister, and wait for evening prayers.' Lord Grantown led the way, and the pair followed. The boy glanced mischievously up at his sister, but she wisely forbore looking at him. ' Do you not like either ? ' asked the master of the house kindly, as his son refused both tea and coffee. ' Papa, yes. I like coffee for breakfast, but I don't want any now.' ' I thought boys could eat and drink whenever they got a chance,' was the reply, given with what was intended for a smile. ' Well, I can't,' retorted Tempeston, rather rudely. Helen glanced nervously at her father, but he only seated himself with a sigh. The brother and sister soon withdrew to a distant sofa, and a laughing whis pered conference began. ' He's going to sleep,' said the boy, glancing at his father, who lay with closed eyes. ' I wish he would.' ' How long now before prayers ? ' ' Only a quarter of an hour. Oh, I'm so tired with"], [52, "Wrong on both Sides, 50 making conversation at dinner!

' He can't hear, even if he is awake.' And he was awake, and, through his almost closed eyes, watching his children, wondering at the change which had come over them in the last few minutes. During the afternoon of that day he had spent twenty minutes with his son, and the whole of that time the lad had never once looked up at him in the manner he was now doing at his sister. Why was he sullen when spoken to for his good ? He had seen other men with their heirs, and things with them had been altogether different. He told himself that such difference arose through his determination not to permit that familiarity between parent and child which characterizes the present day, and which he believed tended to prevent the respect due from the one to the other. Had he been careless as to duty, then that easy intercourse would probably have existed between himself and his"], [53, "Helen '_ First Dinner. 51 children. As he sat in his chair, watching the pair on the sofa, particularly the boy, he told himself that it was his duty to maintain that reserve which he had hitherto done. He would like to have drawn the lad to him as he had seen other fathers do with their sons, speaking to him of those frivolous amusements which, alas ! interested the boy. How handsome and comely he was, with his wavy hair and slight, aristocratic figure, lounging beside his sister ! But if such weakness was complied with, where would be that wholesome fear which it was so necessary his son should feel for him ? His position, he thought, as a Christian parent, precluded him from that joyous intercourse which other parents indulged in with their children. And it was doubly necessary, he considered, that Tempeston should have this fear of him, because the boy was wild and passionate, and he believed fear alone could restrain him. His daughter, too, was an altogether different being, as she sat whispering and laughing with her brother, from what she had been at the head of his dinner table. As he sat in his chair, he hated to think that his presence awed her ;"], [54, "5 2 Wrong on both Sides. yet he believed it was right that it should do so. He would strive to perpetuate it, too, though his weak heart craved for joyous and familiar inter course. Then the prayer-bell clanged forth, and Lord Gran town's meditations were over. ' Only fancy,' said Helen to her brother, as they said good-night in the dimly-lighted gallery, ' a week, and we shall be in London ! I shall be going out with Aunt Harriet, and you will have your tutor. I hope he will worry you to death, just because you made me jump like that in the hall to-night, when I was going in to dinner with papa. I'll never, never forgive it' After this Christian speech the pair separated."], [55, "CHAPTER III. THE THRONE STEPS. JgfTfTl^T was four o'clock on the afternoon of the JoJl }^i ist of May 188 \u2014 , and Tempeston was standing in a disconsolate way in his own room at Lord Grantown's house in Great Stanhope Street, Mayfair. The whole party had arrived at Waterloo at a quarter-past two that day, and were just then in the midst of the confusion of unpacking, while all were a trifle cross at finding themselves in London. Each year it was a grievance to leave home for the wilderness of bricks and mortar which go to make up our modern Babylon. Lord Grantown's decision, how ever, on the point was irrevocable. He himself was obliged to be in London in order that, from his place 53"], [56, "Wrong 011 both Sides. 54 in the hereditary chamber, he might, should opportunity occur, seek to rouse the bishops of the Established Church from that dangerous lethargy into which he believed they had fallen. He brought his children to London because he believed that, as a widower, it behoved him to keep them perpetually with him, though they, poor things, derived but little pleasure from the trip. In the morning, about nine o'clock, they walked in a deserted part of Hyde Park for half an hour, and then came lessons, which lasted to nearly luncheon time. Lord Grantown made a point of presiding at the mid day meal, though his presence certainly did not add to his children's appetite. He sat at the head of the table, solemn and sad, carving for them, but eating nothing himself, because it was not his custom to eat at two o'clock. In the morning he rose at seven, breakfasted at nine, ate a biscuit and drank a glass of sherry at one, and dined at eight. After the two o'clock meal there were more lessons for the schoolroom party, then tea, and afterwards \u2014 the solace of the day \u2014 a couple of hours' walk, when Miss"], [57, "The Throne Steps. 55 Emmett was free to take her charges where she pleased, provided it was not in the neighbourhood of Rotten Row. There are, however, plenty of places as good, if not better. There are few more pleasant walks than along Piccadilly about six o'clock on an afternoon in the season. The kind governess, thinking that her pupils needed a little change and excitement after the dull schoolroom in Great Stanhope Street, was wont, while carrying out Lord Grantown's direction con cerning Hyde Park to the letter, to take her charges where there was life and gaiety. The year, however, of which I am writing was to be in some respects different from other years. On the 5 th of May Lady Helen was to be presented by her Aunt Harriet, and after that would altogether cease to belong to the schoolroom party. But, though her pupils were reduced, Miss Emmett's responsibilities were increased, since Lord Grantown had given her to understand that she was always to know where Tempeston went for his walks, how long he was out, and many other things beside. The boy, as I have said, was standing in the middle"], [58, "56 Wrong on both Sides. of his room at four o'clock on the day of their arrival in town, when he received an unexpected summons from his father, to the effect that he was to put on his best hat and coat, and be ready to go out in half an hour. Of course, under such circumstances, Miss Emmett's services were required. It was she, and she alone, who knew in which portmanteau his jacket was, and in which box his clean collars were to be found. The boy was naturally exceedingly tidy, \u2014 in fact, more so than youths of his age generally are, \u2014 so the poor governess was required to find, or give direc tions for finding, a great number of other articles besides those already named, while Tempeston bathed the dust of the railway journey from his face and hands. It was with an almost motherly pride that Miss Emmett watched the lad, when his toilet was complete, as he descended the stairs. Very nice indeed he looked in his short jacket, dark-blue tie, snow-white collar and cuffs, well-made trousers, and pair of patent leather walking boots. The hat, too, which he carried in his hand was new and glossy."], [59, "The Throne Steps. 57 ' Where is his lordship ? ' Tempeston asked of the butler ; and, having learned in reply that he was in the study, went thither. He opened the door softly, and, looking in, beheld, to his amazement, his father drinking tea. ' Come in,' said the latter encouragingly, as the boy paused, \u2014 ' come in and have a cup. I ordered it ex pressly for you.' ' Ordered it for me ! ' in a tone of surprise. ' Yes. I don't drink it myself as a rule, but, as I was tired and the tea was there, I thought it might refresh me.' ' But, papa, there would have been tea in the school room in half an hour \u2014 proper tea, you know,' with a look of contempt at the three little tiny slices of bread and butter. ' I could not wait for you. It's nearly five now, and I have to be at the House. I am going to take you down also ; for I expect a gentleman to come to me in the lobby some time this afternoon, and I wish to intro duce you to him. I don't know when we shall be back, so I have ordered them to lay a place for you at dinner E"], [60, "58 Wrong 011 both Sides. to-night, as you have had to go without your proper tea, as you call it' Tempeston had never been at the House, and so was rather pleased. He knew fellows at Eton who used sometimes to go with their fathers, but hitherto he had never liked to ask to be taken. Those fellows' fathers were different from his, he thought sadly. When the three little slices had been eaten, and the tea consumed, Lord Grantown led the way to the brougham which was waiting at the hall door. The master of the house left a message for his eldest daughter, saying it might be a little after eight before they returned, and he would be glad if dinner could be put back a quarter of an hour. Then father and son stepped into the carriage and drove away. There was a silence for a little time between the pair, and Tempeston wondered whether he was expected to talk or hold his tongue. Some repairs were being done to the road in Curzon Street, and the coachman had therefore driven round by Park Lane and Picca dilly. They passed St. James's Club, and the boy tried to remember the name of it, but failed. He glanced"], [61, "The Throne Steps. 59 up at the men looking out of the window at the passers by, and recalled how his schoolfellows used to talk glibly of this or that club to which their fathers belonged while he knew not whether his father had a club or not. He was just reflecting over this, when a group of ' sand wich-men ' passed by, carrying advertisements of some new play which was being performed at one of the principal theatres. ' Oh, papa,' exclaimed the boy, without thinking much of what he was saying, ' I should like to go to a theatre ! ' ' A what ! ' returned Lord Grantown in dismay. ' A theatre.' He was engrossed in the subject, and did not notice the tone of his father's voice. ' Do you think I should allow you to go to such a place ? ' ' But, papa, Smart and Charlie Stanley,' naming two Etonians, ' used to go with their fathers.' ' I care nothing for that. Doubtless they are mere men of the world, who wish their sons to be men of the world after them,' returned Lord Grantown. ' And Bletchley, too ; his father always took him '"], [62, "Wrong on both Sides. 60 went on the boy, warming to the subject, and speaking of the eldest son of a man whose name was respected throughout the length and breadth of the country for his philanthropy. The gentleman addressed was silent. He could not bring himself to abuse one whom everybody, from the Queen downwards, delighted to honour ; and yet, in his own heart, he believed that the act of going to the theatre was altogether detrimental to the morals of youth. On the spur of the moment he could not find an answer to the lad's query. He was annoyed at the dilemma Tempeston had placed him in, and was also vexed that a child of his could entertain such a wish. ' Their fathers took them,' urged the youth, and still Lord Grantown sat silent. ' And I should like to go with you,' murmured the boy gently, and blushing a little, as though half afraid of what he was saying. It was not often Tempeston spoke in that way ; indeed, his father had never heard him do so before. The truth was that the lad had been mentally contrast ing his own position with that of his former school-"], [63, "The Throne Steps. 61 fellows. He recalled their delight when ' the governor ' paid them a visit, and how Smart's father used to walk up and down under the shade of the great trees with his hand resting on his son's shoulder. A sudden wish had swept across the boy's mind that he might be as these lads were with their fathers ; hence the sweet, gentle tone which Lord Grantown had never heard before. And in a moment there came over the latter again the weakness he had felt in the library on the night when he had watched through his half-closed eyes his son and daughter whispering lovingly and laughingly together. Once more, at the sound of the half-caressing murmur, ' I should like to go with you,' came the long ing to draw his boy to himself as he had seen other fathers do ; but he put it away from him as he had done before. It was his duty to answer this request in no uncertain tone, and yet for a moment he allowed himself a respite, while his eyes dwelt on the handsome, flushed face beside him. He would like to have been able to grant his boy this favour, but it was impossible ; to do so would be to err against his whole rule of life."], [64, "Wrong on both Sides. 62 He was silent, while his glance rested on Tempeston, and he knew that he was proud of his son. Frequently his brother peers brought their heirs to stand on the throne steps, and he bethought himself how common place the lads were as a rule. Now and then, only, was there a handsome one among them, and none that he had seen had ever eclipsed his boy. His boy ! with the curly brown hair and blue, blue eyes. He must hide from the lad all this weakness, must answer him sternly, coldly. He had never heard that gentle tone before ; would he hear it again if he answered thus ? No matter ; it was his duty, and he would do it. Away with such weakness ! ' No son of mine,' Lord Grantown said sharply, ' shall do such a thing. What others do, I care not. I know that such a place is bad, and you shall never go.' The momentary wish was gone from the lad. He had been a fool to think that his father could ever be as other fathers ; besides, he had forgotten for a second that which must always place a barrier between them. What other father would have kept a son from his dying mother, but his ?"], [65, "The Throne Steps. 63 ' No,' the boy answered roughly, ' I suppose not, just because I said I should like it. If I hated going you'd take me fast enough. It's always the way with you.' What a great change ! Could this be the lad who had spoken but a moment ago so gently. Yes, duty was never easy, thought Lord Grantown. If he had been weak and sinful, giving the permission asked for, he would have heard again the caressing tone ; because he had done right, this was the result. ' Everything I ask for is refused,' the boy went on, as his temper rose. ' I don't often beg a favour of you, and I never will again. I wish, oh, I wish I had been born some one else's son instead of yours ! Then I would have had somebody who cared to do little things when I asked. I should have been happy, instead of wretched and ' \u2014 The young voice broke suddenly, and the flushed face was turned away to hide the hot salt tears.

'You are very young, my dear, and do not know what is for your good,' he said, putting out his hand and touching his son almost timidly. ' By and by, please God, you will recognise that I have been right in this. Come, we are just there. Do not \u2014 do not cry.' ' Leave me alone ! ' retorted the boy, turning his blue eyes full on his father and looking very fierce. ' I was a fool to mind.' To Lord Grantown's relief all trace of tears had vanished. His son was always handsome, he knew, but he thought he had never seen him look as beautiful as he did just then, with that flush on his cheek. He was glad that it should be so. He knew \u2014 or perhaps I should say he thought he knew, since every one really respected him \u2014 that he was sometimes an object of ridicule to his companions in the House, and it hurt him to feel this. But to-day things would be different. He led the way through the peers' entrance, while Tempeston followed, and as he passed a man here and there of whom yesterday he had been almost afraid, he"], [67, "The Throne Steps. 65 felt altogether different. And it was right, he con sidered, that it should be so. Had not the Royal Psalmist said that children were a gift from the Lord, and that the man who possessed them should not be ashamed when he spake with his enemies in the gate ? As he returned the salutations of those he fancied most wont to ridicule him, \u2014 and Lord Grantown saw their glance turned once, twice, and even thrice upon the graceful young figure near him, \u2014 he told himself, in very truth, that he was not ashamed. He entered the House with a far more confident air than usual, telling the boy that he might either sit on the throne steps, or stand, as he preferred, provided he kept behind the gilt rail ; and then passed to his place, feeling still the spirit of that verse in the Psalms. And I, who saw the boy standing there that day, with his wavy hair, blue eyes, and comely, graceful figure, think that any man who had owned such a son should have felt as Lord Grantown did. The lad, left to himself, stood leaning across the bar, while he made a careful survey of the magnificent chamber. The House was very full, since a specially"], [68, "Wrong on both Sides. 66 interesting debate relating to Ireland was on, and it was known that a division might be taken about seven or eight o'clock. A great orator, a brilliant statesman, and the leader of the party just then in Opposition, was on his legs, denouncing the occupants of the ministerial bench. As he leant across the table, in an attitude peculiar to him, the speaker declared that the hands of the Queen's ministers were morally red with the blood of every landlord and agent who had been murdered in Ireland during the previous winter ; and finally, after this parting shot, sat down amidst loud applause. Then from the ministerial bench arose an old gentleman with grey hair, who, Tempeston thought the moment he began to speak, was the most perfect old gentleman he had ever seen in his life. He wore a black frock coat, loosely buttoned, a check neckcloth, tied in a very large bow, whilst he leant on a walking stick as he spoke, having recently, so he informed the House, recovered from an attack of gout. The old gentleman, in the most dulcet tones, re plied to the strictures of the noble speaker opposite,"], [69, "The Throne Steps. 67 and proved conclusively \u2014 at least, to the minds of his own supporters \u2014 that all a Government could do had been done to maintain law and order in Ireland. After that he sat down, and some one else rose, to whom nobody appeared to pay the slightest attention. Tempeston, leaning across the rail, was just thinking it very bad manners for so many of those present to talk whilst one of their number was speaking, when his attention was attracted by somebody close by, regarding him carefully. The stranger was a tall, slight man, at least six feet in height, and of the most distinguished appearance. He had eyes of greyish blue, remarkably handsome features, and a small imperial. This last, like the hair on his head, was just tinged with white, although he was not much past fifty, and, indeed, he looked some ten years younger. He leaned against the woodwork on the ministerial side of the House, and regarded Tempeston, as I have said, carefully. It was a kind face, but yet it wore so sad an expression that the boy could not help noticing it. Presently Tempeston observed the tall stranger stop"], [70, "68 Wrong on both Sides. a passer-by, and say something. He knew directly what it was, for the latter turned and looked at him ; then shook his head. Evidently the gentleman had asked his friend if he knew who he, Tempeston, was. The boy blushed, but was conscious of a feeling of pleasure. Every time he glanced in the same direction he met the blue-grey eyes, and each time he could not help thinking how sadly they looked at him. At length, turning to see if they were still regarding him, he found the stranger close beside him. The latter looked down and smiled kindly. ' Is this your first visit to the House? ' he asked. ' Yes.' ' And how do you like it ? ' ' Oh, very much.' ' And did you understand the debate ? ' ' A little, not all.

He did seem angry.' ' And yet, I daresay, he may meet your friend with the walking-stick somewhere this evening, and chat away with him.' ' Really,' said the boy, ' I should not have thought that. I can understand fellows, after they have quarrelled and had it out in a mill, making it up.' The stranger laughed at the boy's answer. ' They have been scolding each other across that table for years past, \u2014 in fact, ever since they have been in the House together,\u2014 but that would not prevent their being friends out of doors. But tell me, which side does your father sit ? perhaps I know him.' ' That is him there, low down on the left,' replied the boy, pointing to the end of the Conservative benches, near the bar. ' Where \u2014 which ? ' said the gentleman hurriedly ; ' not \u2014 not Grantown ? ' ' Yes.' Glancing up at the stranger, Tempeston thought he"], [72, "Wrong on both Sides. 70 saw an involuntary smile pass across his face, but, if so, it was quickly repressed. \u2022 And are you at Eton ? ' ' Not now. I was, but papa has just taken me away, because I did not get on fast enough.' ' Ah, that's a pity. You were sorry to leave ? ' Oh yes.' ' I can fancy that. I am an old Etonian myself. How long have you been there ?' ' Three years.' ' And how old are you ? ' ' Fifteen.' ' Ah, even the same ' \u2014 The gentleman broke off abruptly, while across the sad face there stole a look of acute pain. 'Are you ill ? ' involuntarily asked the lad. ' No, my boy,' was the answer, and he laid his hand kindly on the shoulder of his youthful questioner. Looking up at him just then, Tempeston thought he had never seen any one the least like this stranger.

' I wish he did not look so sad, though,' the boy thought. Just at that moment the statesman with the dark beard intimated that he should not use his power and divide the House. No sooner was this announcement made, than nearly every one present took their de parture as rapidly as possible. The old gentleman with the walking-stick opened a despatch-box, and began reading some papers, while a grey-headed man opposite was making a speech in a very low voice. Still, in spite of the deserted aspect of the chamber, the tall stranger lingered beside Tempeston. ' Very likely your father will speak in a minute,' he whispered to the boy ; ' he generally does, when there's anything of this sort on.' ' Is \u2014 is it anything to do with the bishops ?

His companion laughed ' Lord Dreadrington is asking the Government to"], [74, "Wrong on both Sides. 72 introduce a bill making religious instruction compulsory in Board schools; your father is certain to support him.' Lord Grantown, however, did not get an opportunity. The moment the speaker had ceased, the kindly old gentleman with the walking-stick rose from his seat. It was his mission in life to often pour oil on troubled waters. He stood at the table then, and sought to console the disturbed nobleman, while refusing him that which his soul craved. He refused him, yet he did not leave him quite without comfort. He did not say that, at some future period, the Government would introduce such a bill, but he hinted, or seemed to hint, at some such possibility. Then Lord Dreadrington, having aired his grievance, expressed himself satisfied ; at which Tempeston's father exclaimed, ' No, no ! ' and the old gentleman with the walking-stick in great haste moved the adjournment. Lord Grantown stared in amazement at the stranger, who was explaining some Parliamentary rule to his son just as he came up. It was evident that the two men, though they knew each other's names and appearances, were not acquainted.

Lord Grantown looked half gratified, yet half dis trustful, as he replied something about his son, and being very much obliged. ' I expect your new tutor is in the lobby, Tempest, so we had better go and look for him there. He has been in the gallery during the sitting.' This was why he had been brought down to the House, then, the boy thought. He looked up at his new friend, as he prepared to follow his father from the chamber, as though uncertain whether to say good-bye. ' I am going out through Westminster Hall,' the stranger replied to the glance ; 'so I will come with you through the lobby' When they reached the vestibule, they found a short, stout gentleman, with a schoolmaster's air, awaiting them, and Tempeston guessed at once that this was the new tutor. 'I must not keep you,' said the unknown. 'Lord Grantown, we have sat opposite each other for many years without being introduced.

Constant change of scene has been good for her, but this autumn we mean to remain in England, and shall pass the long recess at Shirley Park.'

I shall see you again there.' ' I hope we may not have to wait till August for that,' was the kind reply. ' Perhaps your father will allow you to come and see me at luncheon to-morrow?' ' May I, papa ?

' repeated Lord Grantown. ' I'm not deaf,' retorted his son ; ' and I Avish you Avould not speak so loud ! Every one is listening.'

DISOBEDIENCE. \u00abKj JIkHE new tutor arrived at Great Stanhope ifeSa ;SgL Street the next morning at ten, and it was understood he would remain till two o'clock. As long as the family stayed in town he was to come by the day, but when once they had returned to the country Mr. Marshall was to take up his abode with them permanently. Lord GrantoAvn carried off the tutor into his own library for a private conversation, which lasted nearly half an hour, during Avhich Tempeston hung about the hall, and felt very uncomfortable. At length the door of his father's sanctum opened, and the pair came out. Mr. Marshall was, as I have said, a short, fat man,"], [104, "102 Wrono- on both Sides. _> and, I might have added, an ugly one. Though he Avas only about five-and-thirty, yet he was already bald, Avhich made him look considerably older. His cheeks Avere puffy and remarkable for a brilliant colour, Avhile his eyes Avere like two large black beads. Alto gether the tutor was not a prepossessing person, and his new pupil felt sure he should not like him. ' Well, young man,' said the former, addressing Tempeston, and shaking hands after the manner of a prize-fighter with his opponent before commencing a combat, \u2014 ' well, young man, and are you prepared to Avork hard ? ' The lad was rather proud, and he did not exactly relish being called ' young man,' or being spoken to so patronizingly. He drew himself up, and flushed a little, but did not answer. ' I hope, Tempest,' broke in Lord Grantown, noticing the boy's manner and attitude, 'I hope Ave are not going to have any sulkiness, but that you come deter mined to turn over a new leaf. I have been shoAvin\"- Mr. Marshall all the letters I received from Eton about you, and he comprehends everything.'"], [105, "Disobedience. 103 These letters were very sore subjects to the boy at any time, and especially so just then, when he Avas so full of good resolutions. Unfortunately they were not confined to complaints about idleness ; but related to several foolish scrapes into which the lad had got, including the famous absence for the whole of one Ascot cup day, and Avhich had so nearly resulted in expulsion. It Avould, perhaps, have been better if Lord GrantoAvn had not informed his son that he had thought it advisable to show the epistles in question to Mr. Marshall. True, he had done so solely because he believed it best that the tutor should fully understand his pupil's character, but Tempeston never stopped to think of that. When his father spoke of the infor mation he had given Mr. Marshall, the boy did not ansAver, but shot at him a glance so full of hatred that Lord Grantown Avas absolutely startled. All the good intentions which Tempeston had made after his intervieAv with Lady Meltonbury vanished at once. If he was to be thought and called a black sheep, then a black sheep he would most certainly be. He had knoAvn the moment he had seen Mr. Marshall in the"], [106, "Wrong on both Sides. 104 lobby of the House of Lords that he should not like him ; but he had meant to try and Avork hard and keep out of mischief. Noav all that Avas over. He Avould have to sit Avith his tutor Avhen his tutor came, but that Avas all he Avould do. As to preparing lessons, or anything of that sort, Tempeston told himself, in expressive but schoolboy slang, ' that he Avould be hung first and then he wouldn't' Lord GrantoAvn saAv his son's look of hatred, and saAv, too, that the young face settled into a very determined expression, as though it had taken a resolution and meant to keep it. ' What do you mean, sir, by looking at me like that ? If I think it's my duty to inform Mr. Marshall of your faults, for your OAvn good, is that a reason for you to become sulky and get into a passion ? ' ' I'm not in a passion,' the boy retorted. ' There, Mr. Marshall, you see thus early the truth of Avhat I told you. I hope you will keep a firm hold over him ; I leave him entirely in your charge.' ' I will do my best, my lord,' the tutor answered ; ' but I fear, from Avhat I see, my task will be no easy one."], [107, "Disobedience. 105 Come into the study, sir, and let me see how far you are advanced.' 'And, oh, Mr. Marshall,' broke in Lord GrantoAvn, ' Avhatever lessons you set him, kindly leave me a note of them. I Avill see that they are duly prepared in my library before he goes out.' ' Thank you, my lord. Come, sir, come.' The tutor led the Avay into a dingy back chamber, which had been originally intended for a smoking room, but in Lord Grantown's house Avas used for no particular purpose. This apartment had noAv been made over formally to Mr. Marshall, for the use of himself and pupil. ' And Avhere are your books ? ' the former asked ; ' where are the books you used at Eton ? ' The boy turned round to where he had placed them, in a cupboard by the window, and taking out some half dozen jerked them on to the table.

' ' Why, it's what I used to do my work Avith at Eton.' ' I never heard such a flagrant piece of dishonesty in all my life ! ' 'What !' exclaimed Tempeston, springing up angrily at the Avord 'dishonesty,' \u2014 'Avhat do you say?' The boy looked so fierce that Mr. Marshall, although a strong man, felt rather uncomfortable. Lord Gran town had spoken of his son that morning as though he was half a Avild animal, and the tutor Avould, I think, not have been surprised if the lad had sprung at him, then and there. ' No violence, please,' said Mr. Marshall, holding up"], [109, "Disobedience. 107 his left hand. ' If you reflect for a moment you will perceive that I used a correct term !

If you can apply to such conduct any other Avord except that Avhich I have used, I shall be happy to hear your explanation.' Whatever faults Tempeston had, he was truthful and honourable in the extreme. The expression which his new tutor had used Avas offensive to him in the highest degree, but he began to see that Mr. Marshall had used it Avith some reason, though under a misappre hension. All the anger faded aAvay out of the boy's face, and he began to laugh. ' It Avas not dishonest,' he said. ' The masters kneAV it perfectly Avell. They can't prevent it.'

' I can scarcely credit my ears,' exclaimed Mr. Marshall, on Avhom, hoAvever, the conviction Avas groAving that he did not understand the ways and customs of the great public school in question, and that it was better to let the subject drop. Meamvhile he confis cated all Tempeston's classical translations, intimating that he Avished, as a matter of interest, to look through them carefully. As the boy had never been in the habit of preparing his Avork Avithout the aid of a crib, he began to wonder how he should get on. It did not matter, hoAvever; the worst that Mr. Marshall could do would be to complain of him to his father, and Tempeston found that every day his dislike for the latter increased, Avhile the fear of him died aAvay. The morning crept sloAvly on. Mr. Marshall having become more civil, the boy condescended to translate Latin into bad English, and Greek into something Avhich Avas certainly not the vulgar tongue.

Poor Tempeston ! he felt he had never done so much work in the whole of his life. Ever since half-past ten he had sat at that table and racked his brains. Good gracious ! he should never be able to go on at that rate. He had just thought this, when his tutor handed him a slip of paper, on which was written the lessons he required his pupil to prepare for the next day. The boy, glancing at it, beheld C\u00e6sar, Horace, some mathematics, and, as a crown to all his woe, a set of Latin verses. He knew, from past experience, that, if he sat down then and there, he might \u2014 it Avas by no means certain, but still he might \u2014 conclude his task by seven o'clock. And at half-past five he was to be on Carlton House Terrace to ride with Olga, and after wards to have tea there."], [112, "Wrong on both Sides. 110 ' It's too much,' he gasped out. 'Your father will sit with you,' said Mr. Marshall. ' He has kindly promised to help you. We thought tAvo hours and a half would be sufficient, but if it is not you must lengthen it by another hour. Noav I will just see Lord Grantown for a moment or tAvo. Good morning.' Tempeston, left alone, made one remark out loud : ' I'll keep the appointment, though, let them do what they will.' Then he ran up-stairs to dress ready for riding, so as to set at his books immediately after luncheon. He took everything he could possibly want, except a whip.

To do that he must have his hat in the hall. Accordingly, ten minutes after the rest of the household Avere assembled round the luncheon table, the boy came out of his room, and, running"], [113, "Disobedience. 111 quickly doAvn-stairs, deposited his best ' topper ' in a safe place, then, opening the dining-room door, entered the apartment. Mr. Marshall had gone for the day evidently, as he was not there. ' Hoav is this, Tempest ? ' Lord GrantoAvn asked. ' Hoav is it that you come ten minutes late ?

' And how long do you take to wash your hands ? ' ' I had more to do than that. I had to change my clothes.' 'Why?' ' I have to go out by and by,' replied the boy, letting slip the very thing he had meant to keep secret. ' Where, sir, and when ? ' asked Lord GrantoAvn, ' To meet a friend at half-past five.' ' Then you won't do anything of the kind, as a punishment for answering in the way you have. You will come to me in the library at half-past three, for a couple of hours, to prepare your lessons for to-morrow.' The boy lost his temper at once.

By this time it was half-past three, and he accordingly packed up his books and took himself off to the library. His father was already there. ' Begin with the C\u00e6sar,' the latter said. ' I have done it,' replied the boy ; ' there it is ; ' and he pointed to a fair copy translation. ' When did you do it ? ' ' After luncheon.' ' Oh, well, take the Horace.' ' That's done too.'

Tempeston said nothing, but sat down to Avork. The afternoon was very hot, and he felt anything but inclined for more study ; nevertheless, he went at it Avith a will. The anticipated ride kept him up. When the clock struck four the boy had done three verses out of eight Lord GrantoAvn was pleased to see his son working so diligently, and, rising from his chair, went OA^er to Avhere he was sitting, and, wonderful to relate, rested his hand on the lad's shoulder. ' How are you getting on ? ' he asked. Now, it so happened that he bent over his son at a most unpropitious moment. Tempeston wanted a dactyl and could only find spondees.

He began to feel sorry he had acted a little impulsively and destroyed the verses ; yet he told himself it was necessary that he should punish the boy. He Avished the lad would raise his head, and begin to work again. He did not like to see him sitting there so dejected. Though Lord Grantown appeared hard and cold, in reality he Avas far from being so, and he loved his children dearly. True, they were wholly ignorant of it, but that was because he had carefully hidden the fact from them as though it were a Aveakness. He believed that if he exhibited his affection there would have been an end to all that obedience he required from his offspring. Thus the love was pushed out of sight, and the children believed that it did not exist."], [119, "Disobedience. 117 Five o'clock struck, and still Tempeston lay quiet.

Once there the lad did not"], [120, "Wrong on both Sides. 118 linger, but caught up his hat and dashed out of the house. Tempeston did not like to run along the street in Avhich he lived and Avas well known, but he Avalked very rapidly.

During afternoon preparation things Avent from bad to worse, until a violent quarrel between father and son brought all attempts at study to an end. Tempeston completely lost control over himself, flung the books across the room, accidentally upsetting the ink as he did so over the Turkey carpet, and finally strode out of the room and out of the house. The boy rode Avith Olga in the park, and poured all his troubles into her sympathizing ear, receiving in return comfort and good advice. After tea on Carlson House Terrace, Lady Meltonbury, seeing the boy Avas far from Avell, contrived to get him to tell her about his difficulties.

Some ten minutes elapsed before the medical man arrived, and by that time, under the governess's firm but kind treatment, the boy's tears had ceased, and the only remains of the attack was an occasional convulsive sob.

The wise counsels, too, that the golden-haired Lady Olga gave the boy under the trees of Rotten Row had perhaps stimulated him still more than anything else. He wanted to be like Holme, she would say; well, then, he must Avork, because that was what Holme did to please papa and mamma. So Tempeston had striven to fulfil the tasks Avhich Mr. Marshall set, and did his best ; until all at once the young brain, unaccustomed to real Avork, broke doAvn.

Lady Meltonbury and Olga used to come and sit during the hot hours of the July afternoons beside the boy's sofa, bringing Avith them floAvers and the choicest fruits.

Miss Emmett, with Lina, had gone to schoolroom tea, Avhile Helen Avas out riding. Suddenly the boy heard a step on the gravel path near, and, looking up, beheld his father.

Lying under the green trees, quiet and silent, the boy's anger began to die aAvay. He felt, though he would not own it, even to himself, a little sorry he had spoken quite so plainly. It was true Tempeston had no very great affection for his father. The latter had always seemed so stern and severe that the lad had never suspected the deep love Lord Grantown felt towards him. He had appeared harsh, not because he was so naturally, as I have frequently said, but simply because he believed it to be the proper course to pursue in order to win the respect and confidence of his children. The man's eyes had been opened, during the last few weeks, to the knowledge that he had been mistaken. The moment he had realized this truth he set himself to repair his error, and Tempeston's answer that August evening was his reward."], [184, "Wrong on both Sides. 182 The boy felt a little sorry, as I have already men tioned. He was naturally warm-hearted and affec tionate, and after a fit of anger was ahvays deeply grieved for whatever he had said. The only person to whom he had hitherto addressed bitter speeches and felt no regret was his father. Tempeston had never forgiven the not being alloAved to go to his mother on that memorable last day of her life. Long brooding over it, he had groAvn to hate the hand that had kept them apart, and never for a moment paused to consider that Lord GrantoAvn had done only what he believed was best for his wife. Unhappily the act had sown a seed of hatred in the boy's heart towards his father, and the latter's subsequent fault-finding, threatenings, and lectures, caused in reality only by over-anxiety for the lad's welfare, had all been mis understood, and had even tended to foster the groAvth of the ill weed to a dangerous extent. But, on the particular evening of which I am speaking, there was a slight change in Tempeston's feelings to the ones he usually experienced after a round of biting Avords Avith his parent. The boy could"], [185, "Cruel Words. 183 not quite forget the spasm of agony that had crossed his father's face when the words ' I hate you ' had been spoken.

Often he had confided it to the child when he had been angry Avith his sisters or Emmett \u2014 dear, kind Emmett, whom his warm heart loved so well, and sometimes in his hours of penitence had even confessed to her some of the things he had said. But he felt he could never dare to meet those grave eyes again, if once he had Avhispered in her ear that he had looked upon his father's face and said, ' I hate you.' The governess and Lina came back about half-past six, and broke in upon Tempeston's meditations. He was distracted, and they were unable to get him to laugh and talk as he usually did.

Nothing more was said then, but, whilst Helen was dressing for the evening, Miss Emmett paid a visit to the girl's room and counselled her to be prudent at dinner.

Helen sighed as she nodded her head, and the pair, arm-in-arm, passed through the gloomy hall, passed the library door, and ascended to their own part of the house. The library door ! Within the room the grey-haired father was sitting, silent, alone, and Avretched. He had eaten nothing, and wished for nothing. The footman brought in coffee, and he drank a cup mechanically, and then was alone again. ' I hate you.'

Tempeston, Avhen he thought of this or that event, above all of his separation from his mother during the closing hours of her life, did feel hatred in his heart towards his father ; but still it was not a hatred so great as Lord GrantoAvn believed.

He rang the bell, and sent the servants to bed, and then he resumed his train of thought. Hated by his son ! Very likely that Avas the sentiment entertained by all his other children for him. True, they had not said it, but that was only because Tempeston was more open. He told himself, and Avith truth, that his boy scorned a lie. How he loved the lad, \u2014 loved even his very faults ! He would have striven, if he had been allowed, to aid in overcoming them ; but, alas ! he was not so alloAved. There was no con fidence between them, there was no love \u2014 only hatred.

The holidays Avere in full SAving, but the holiday-makers Avere too lazy and languid to do anything but lie about under the green trees reading story-books.

The boy was getting stronger every day in spite of the heat, but still the doctor said, ' No books.' Lord Grantown, sitting near the open AvindoAv of his library, used to hear the gay voices and merry laughter and the patter of feet in the great hall, but that Avas all. He never went out to them. Why should he, since his advent would have been the signal for dismayed looks, and a sudden end of all laughter and fun ? He sat alone. It was his business to wait until the time came. Then, and then only, would he arise and go to his children, \u2014 then, when they needed him. But oh ! he was sad of heart, and daily his hair looked whiter and his face older.

After his biscuit and glass of sherry at two o'clock, he took his hat and wandered away alone into the woods, Avhere it was not too hot to Avalk. It was better than sitting still, but it was very solitary. Now and then he AA'Ould meet one of his Avoodmen, and then he used to sit doAvn and chat. Formerly he Avould have returned the touch of the hat and passed on, thinking nothing of the man to Avhom he paid Avages, but of this or that theory, which, if once adopted, would, he believed, put doAA'n infidelity for ever.

A Avoodman was better than nothing, so he used to sit and talk about the toiler's life, his wife and family.

Often the father, glancing round, would see the deep blue eyes watching him curiously. Sometimes Tem peston thought of making a remark, to see what would happen, but as day succeeded day, and still his father did not speak, he got shy.

With his Avarm, loving heart, he did not relish seeing the weary look upon his father's face, nor meeting the dark, grave eyes, which looked so full of sadness and reproach at him. Once or tAvice, when he was not feeling very strong, he made an excuse to leave the dinner-table early, and afterwards questioned Helen closely as to the conversation which had taken place after his departure.

It was a burning hot afternoon when he set off, about five o'clock, for Shirley Park, on horseback. The gates of Lord Meltonbury's place were not quite two miles from the lodge at GrantoAvn, so he did not take very long trotting over. Fortunately the road was shady most of the Avay, so that Tempeston Avas not very much done up when he reached his destination. Shirley was not a large place, though the property Avas extremely valuable.

The young visitor dismounted, and Avas shown through the hall into the drawing-room, a long apartment, Avith four windoAvs, looking out into a flower-garden. The furniture was old-fashioned and rather ugly, but Tempeston did not notice it.

She must wait and see if the little seed she had timidly endeavoured to sow would ripen into anything. It was some minutes before the boy could quite recover himself; but, as Olga cleverly propounded several schemes for passing the time at Meltonbury, he was at length aroused to real interest on the subject. They sat chatting till seven o'clock struck, making Tempeston start. ' I must go,' he exclaimed. ' I have to ride home and dress, and all sorts of things, before dinner.' Lady Meltonbury and Olga came and stood at the"], [215, "Good Advice. 213 hall door while the young viscount mounted his horse. ' Good-bye,' he said, looking down with a sunny smile at the pair.

The girl kissed her companion affectionately; a salute Avhich Avas returned by a Avarm brotherly hug. ' That's what the big monkeys do,' he explained, as Helen endeavoured to repair some of the creases in her frock. ' And small ones, too, sometimes, sir,' she returned, laughing. An exciting race on tiptoe round the hall-table followed, till the girl was caught. Tempeston con ducted her to the foot of the schoolroom stairs, and there dismissed her with another monkey hug by Avay of punishment. Left once more to himself, he returned to the hall. The youthful viscount sat upon the oak table, SAvinging his legs, for about five minutes, and then Lord Grantown came out of the dining-room, on his Avay to the library. He gave a perceptible start as his glance fell on his son, but he passed on, as was his Avont now, without a word.

Lord Grantown closed the library door behind him, Avhile Tempeston sat on, SAvinging his legs, and reflecting deeply. He wanted to get up and ask his father's leave for the proposed visit, and he Avanted, as he had told Olga, to offer some sort of apology. Olga wanted him to do it, too, but something kept him back. He told himself he was shy, that he didn't knoAV what answer he might receive to any expression of regret which he might utter. The simple truth was, that in the great still hall there was another than Tempeston present, unseen, it is true, by mortal eye, but yet dimly suspected by the boy him self. Yes, close beside him, whispering in his ear, was the black spirit Pride. At last the lad did that Avhich we all so often do ; he temporized Avith the evil one. He wouldn't pledge himself to apologize, but would go in and see how things went. If a favourable opportunity arose, why, then, of course, he would do it, but if not, he must wait a day or two.

Besides, there might not be time ; Helen Avould of course return soon. Any Avay, he must go and get leave to visit Meltonbury.

Just then, he was with Tempeston, standing on the hearth-rug beside him in Lord GrantOAvn's library. It was with unfeigned astonishment that the last named individual beheld his son before him. Since their interview beneath the trees, the boy had never once entered the library, and the pair had held no converse together. The father's heart beat a little quicker than usual ; perhaps his son had come to say something about those rash and cruel Avords, to say they Avere not true. For a moment or tAvo neither spoke.

In the great state beds had slumbered young King Edward the Sixth, James the Second, and the grandson of that ill-fated monarch, the Young Pretender. And besides these recollections were other memories Avhich Lord Meltonbury valued even more. He could remember that day, forty years and more ago, Avhen he himself had been ' young Lord Holme,' and had stood beside his mother at the great entrance watching a procession advancing up the green avenue. He recalled the escort of yeomanry, the outriders, and four-horsed carriage beside which his father rode.

Beyond the garden Avas a huge lake, half a mile across and nearly a mile long, while beyond this again were the water Avoods through Avhich the river ran, and then the line of hills already mentioned, covered with their forest dress of green.

It was so provoking, too, just Avhen he wanted to have a breath of air before it Avas time to dress for dinner. As Tempeston was reflecting thus, the door on his right opened, and Olga appeared. ' Here you are ! ' he exclaimed joyfully. ' I have lost my way completely.' Olga laughed, and pushed open a swing door on the left, which the boy had not noticed. This led on to the landing, and together they descended the staircase. ' Come out,' said the girl, taking a parasol belonging to her mother, and leading the way through an open window into the beautiful gardens. Long did the children linger there, happy in the society of each other, and enjoying the calm beauty of the scene.

The dinner presented a marked contrast to that to Avhich Tempeston Avas accustomed at GrantoAvn. There, the meal was eaten in a big room, badly lighted, and served by a fat butler and a willing but ' dumpy ' footman. At Meltonbury the table Avas resplendent with gold plate, illuminated by numerous Avax-lights carefully shaded, while four tall footmen in powder and black silk stockings glided noiselessly about, under the direction of a butler and a groom of the chambers. As soon as the children Avere able, they made their escape from table, and Avent out again upon the terrace. Tempeston, hoAvever, insisted that Olga should have a shaAvl or scarf around her; and, Avhen the maid had brought the requisite article, the boy carefully folded it round his young and beautiful companion before allowing her to go out into the evening air.

For an hour and more the stillness of the Avarm August evening was broken only by the tread of youth ful feet, the sound of children's voices, and the echo of the nightingale's song far away in the green Avoods. September came, and the partridges with it. At eleven o'clock every morning Lord Melton bury and Tempeston started from the house, and it Avas generally nearly seven before the sound of wheels coming up the avenue announced their return. I do not think either of the ladies quite enjoyed the shooting season. If it rained, and they could not go out, the mother and daughter sat in ' my lady's room ; ' sat all the long afternoons through, and thought of other days, when another boy than Tempeston had Avalked beside Lord Meltonbury, gun in hand.

They rarely met till dinner-time, and then he and his host generally had a good deal to say about their sport.

Towards the end of the month there came a day when there Avas no shooting. It was the third anni versary of the young Lord Holme's death. There was morning service at the exquisite private chapel in the park, where the family vault was situated.

He sat with his friends at the top of the chapel, and watched the sunlight fall through the stained windoAvs, in a flood of crimson and blue, upon the great stone above the vault, on which was carved the coronet and arms of the house of Meltonbury. Huge wreaths of azaleas, lilies, and white roses lay in heaps thereon, and the scent of flowers filled the air. ToAvards the close of the service Lady Meltonbury became greatly overcome, and her husband made her withdraw with him, instead of Avaiting for the end. Thus Olga and Tempeston were left alone, and the last Avail of the sad chant had long died away before the slight, graceful little figure in black raised her face"], [234, "Wrong on both Sides. 232 from her hands, and signed to her companion that it Avas time to go.

So the pair Avandered off along the shore of the lake, until they reached the green Avoods through Avhich the river ran. FolloAving a narrow path, they came to a small bench Avhich stood close to the edge of a bank running doAvn to the stream. Here Olga seated herself, while her companion stretched himself on the grass at her feet. How quiet and pleasant it Avas, that September day, in the water woods of Meltonbury ! Scarcely a sound broke the intense and almost Sabbath-like stillness. Now and then overhead the leaves stirred slightly, lifted by the breeze, or a bird sang forth his merry song, Avhile his little voice sounded loud and clear in the silence"], [235, "The Memory of the Dead. 233 Avhich reigned around. Far aAvay toAvards the left came the murmur of the waterfall near the mill, and once or twice a shout from the men at Avork there. Tempeston lay for a long time with his head resting on his arm, and his eyes closed, when suddenly the sound of a faint sob startled him. He looked up, and saw that Olga was weeping bitterly. All the boy's warm heart woke up at once, and he was beside her in a moment. ' Don't cry, dear,' he said, taking one of the little black-gloved hands in his OAvn rough ones, \u2014 ' don't cry. I knoAV why it is ; and oh, Olga, I wish that I could bring him back to you ! ' ' Oh, I would not have him back, Tempest,' the girl ansAvered, with a sad little smile. ' We, none of us, Avish that.' The boy gazed at his companion in surprise. ' He was not like others,' the girl went on in her soft, low voice.

It was the Sunday before he was taken ill. He seemed quite Avell then, and yet \u2014 yet he died on the Thursday.' Again there was a little silence, Avhile the girl tried to subdue her emotion. ' I think it's so good of God not to let us know Avhat is going to happen, don't you ? Now that Sunday we were both so happy, and hoAv could I have been like that if I had knoAvn ? We came here after church, and he lay where you are now, Tempest, and the day was, oh, so beautiful ! just like this.

Sometimes at night, Tempest, I dream about him, and he always looks so happy, Avith such a smile upon his face ! Mamma says he looked like that when he was dead. They would not let me see him. They were afraid of the infection. I wanted to go, too, so much, just to kiss him once again. It seemed so hard that they should take him away from me Avithout one kiss ; he who never went to bed Avithout putting his dear arms round my neck. Oh, Holme ! oh, darling, darling Holme !

She had ceased to Aveep, but it was Tempeston's turn now. Olga's simple narrative had already upset him, but the closing words relating to his kind friend Lord Meltonbury entirely overcame him. ' Dear boy,' exclaimed the girl, ' don't cry ! It was foolish of me to tell you all this.' 'But I cannot \u2014 I cannot bear to think,' Tempeston answered, 'that he should care for nothing noAv, but ahvays be looking fonvard to death.' ' Oh, but that is not it, Tempest,' Olga ansAvered.

It is only that Avhen death comes it will be sweet for him to meet dear Holme again.' The lad nodded his head, as much as to say he understood.

The girl could not but grant a petition so worded ; othenvise, I think, she would have given poor Tem peston the rebuke of which he stood in such need. Alas, that she did not do so ! The boy's speech did not please her at all. ' I mean to be like Holme \u2014 I Avill tell papa I am sorry \u2014 I will never do wrong or be angry again.'

Once, and once only, her self-command gave Avay, and that Avas Avhen her husband, having paid a visit to the dead heir's rooms, came to ask if she Avould not like to see them too. She shrieked aloud then at the first mention of the proposal. 'Go there!' she cried; 'go where my darling used to be ! No, no ! \u2014 never !

He, Olga, and Tempeston, Avhom the girl invited to join them, were the only persons Avho visited the apart ments, Avhich Avere usually kept locked up. The rooms were apparently just as they had been in the young heir's lifetime. In reality they had been fresh painted and done up generally immediately after his death, so as to destroy all taint of the infectious malady to Avhich he had succumbed. The apartments Avere tAvo in number, \u2014 a bedroom and a study, both overlooking the floAver-gardens, and opening out of each other.

Now and then the young girl paused, and touched some familiar object of former days lovingly, as though she had met an old friend, but that Avas all. They did not speak, and Tempeston, with his warm heart, had hard work to keep back the tears which would rise to his eyes Avhen ever he looked at the faces of Lord Meltonbury and his daughter. A few days after the visit to the rooms of the dead young Earl of Holme, the party, as I have said, left Shropshire for Grantown and Shirley Park respectively. Tempeston was very sorry to part with his kind friends, even though they would still see each other pretty often. He knew how much he should miss his daily intercourse with Olga, and he was also deeply attached to both Lord and Lady Meltonbury.

They Avent up-stairs, and the young traveller Avas refreshed Avith a cup of tea ; while the governess and Lina discussed their substantial evening meal, and Helen sat by and seemed rather thoughtful. Tempeston talked a great deal. He had an immense amount to tell about his kind friends, their beautiful place, and the splendid shooting he had had. ' You have got quite strong again, then ?

' He did not strike me \u2014 indeed, he never did \u2014 as being a very prepossessing person. I daresay, though, that is because his appearance is a little against him.'

It was Avith a beating heart that Tempeston pre pared to go doAArn-stairs the same evening, Avhen he had"], [251, "Broken Faith. 249 finished his toilet for dinner. He had forgotten all about Mr. Marshall, and was thinking only of his meeting with Lord Grantown. He had promised Olga that, if his father seemed to remember Avhat had previously passed between them, he would apologize for his hasty words. He fully meant to keep that promise. Pride was very busy telling him he would loAver himself, and urging sundry objections to the course he proposed to take ; but the odds against the black spirit were heavy. The recollection of a curly golden head and big grey eyes was still very strong Avith Tempeston ; so he descended the stairs nervously, fully intending to keep his promise. The young heir crossed the hall and reached the library door. He paused for a moment, then opened it and entered the apartment. Pride waited outside. The boy's heart was too full of good resolutions, just then, to make it worth his while to go in also. The black spirit waited in the big, gloomy hall. The lad hardly dared to lift his eyes for a minute, then he raised them.

' Quite strong,' the lad answered cheerfully. 'That's well, that's Avell. And you had good shooting ? ' ' Awfully good.' Fancy his father asking about the shooting ! Hoav jolly it all Avas ! There was a silence, while the boy racked his brain, thinking how to begin his little speech. Suppose he broke down ! Suppose Helen or some one came into the room ! The best thing Avould be to say everything very quickly ; as fast as ever he could, in fact. It Avould be over in a minute that way. After all, it"], [253, "Broken Faith. 251 Avould not be a Avorse minute than he spent at the dentist's once. He would begin at once. ' Papa,' he began, in a Ioav voice, while the trailing lashes hid his downcast eyes, and he twisted his hands nervously together, \u2014 ' papa, I have got something to say to you \u2014 something I ought to tell you. I daresay, perhaps, you have forgotten all about it, and didn't care really. It was something I said to you under the trees, when I was ill.' ' I \u2014 I have not forgotten. I did care, my dear.' Such a kind, happy voice ! If his father spoke like that again, he should cry. He mustn't on any account do that. The apology must be finished at once. It was silly to make a muff of oneself. He was so busy with his thoughts that he never heard the footsteps on the thick carpet of some one who had just entered the room. Lord Grantown did not hear either. He was looking with all his eyes at his son, waiting for words he knew were just coming. Then \u2014 then he would snatch his boy to himself, and Tempeston would look up at him with those big blue eyes of his, look up as he had"], [254, "Wrong on both Sides. 252 seen him do at Lord Meltonbury. In a minute, only a minute ! ' Well,' Tempeston Avent on at length, ' I thought \u2014 I mean \u2014 I didn't mean \u2014 I am very' \u2014 A noise behind startled the speaker. He glanced up and beheld Mr. Marshall. It was he Avho had entered the room unheard by either of the occupants ; and in another second, too, through the open door, had come Pride. ' I fear I intrude,' the tutor began, softly rubbing his hands ; ' but I understood Ave gathered in the library before dinner. I trust, young man, you will finish the apology you are making, and '\u2014 ' Mind your own business ! ' Tempeston exclaimed, furious Avith anger in a moment at being detected in Avhat he regarded as a most humiliating position \u2014 by Mr. Marshall, too, of all people in the world ! ' Tempest ! ' exclaimed Lord Grantown, in a pained voice, \u2014 ' Tempest ! ' ' Well,' burst forth the boy, ' Avhat business is it of his, Avhat I say or do?

'"], [255, "Broken Faith. 253 As the last Avords were addressed to Lord Grantown, I think that estimable nobleman felt more bitter anger against the unfortunate tutor than he had ever felt before towards any one, during the whole course of his life. He longed to turn him out of the house, then and there ; but he was a just man, and knew that Mr. Marshall was not really to blame. ' Tempest ! ' was all he could say, again, in a voice full of pain. In his anger the boy recognised the sorrowful tone, and resolved to deal a yet deeper dIoav. ' I do hate you, and every one else in the house does the same \u2014 Helen \u2014 Lina \u2014 all of us ! We Avish you were dead \u2014 there ! Every one of us wishes it' For the first few moments no one spoke. Then, without a word, without a glance at either Mr. Marshall or his son, Lord Grantown turned and left the room. He passed out into the hall, took up his hat, and, opening the door, went out into the dusky tAvilight Left to themselves, the tutor and Tempeston stood"], [256, "Wrong on both Sides. 254 silently glaring at each other. At length the former broke the silence. ' Wretched boy, to use such words to a father ! Shame may Avell cause you to hide your head ! ' This was a figure of speech, presumably, since Tempeston Avas standing upright as a dart. ' It's you Avho ought to be ashamed,' the other exclaimed, with flashing eyes, \u2014 'you, who steal about the house like a spy to pick up Avhat you can hear. You came creeping in like that on purpose, and stood there meanly listening. No gentleman would have done such a thing \u2014 but then you are not a gentleman.' Mr. Marshall, though a short man, was yet a power ful one. He was not good-tempered, \u2014 indeed he Avas rather the reverse, \u2014 and the last audacious sentence from his pupil's lips overcame him completely. He stepped up to the boy and struck him such a box on the ear that the lad staggered, and all but fell. All but fell ! In another moment Tempeston re covered, and, half mad with anger and outraged pride, flung himself on his assailant. The latter was a little"], [257, "Broken Faith. 255 taken aback, and he received two well-delivered blows before he recovered. The tutor, as I have said, was a strong man, and the boy was no match against him. The former caught Tempeston's left arm in a grip of iron, and Avith his right hand delivered blow after bloAv on the boy's ear. In a few seconds the latter was SAvaying half senseless in Mr. Marshall's grasp, and the tutor realized, not without alarm, that he had, in spite of his provocation, gone a little too far. He tried to hold the lad up, but it was a difficult task. At this juncture Helen appeared, and the first glance at her young brother's appearance told her what had happened. She seized the half fainting boy and dragged him to the sofa. ' How dare you ?' she panted indignantly, \u2014 ' how dare you hurt him ? Coward ! to strike one who could not defend himself against you.' ' I had to defend myself against him, young lady,' the tutor retorted angrily. ' Look at my face ; he has struck me two bloAvs. A nice sight I shall be to-morroAv.' ' It Avill serve you perfectly right, Mr. Marshall,'"], [258, "256 Wrong on both Sides. Helen returned indignantly. ' I saw the way you hit him as I came in, and I shall tell papa.' ' Here is Lord Grantown ! ' exclaimed the tutor, as that gentleman re-entered the room. ' My lord, Ave have had a most painful scene. I Avas absolutely obliged to defend myself against your son, Avho has even dared to strike me in the face. Pray obseive the state I am in.' 'Papa,' said Helen, 'it was very wrong of Tempest, but I saAv the manner in which Mr. Marshall struck him. He might have killed him. Just look at him ! ' The youthful viscount did present a someAvhat sorry spectacle. He was leaning back on the sofa, his collar torn, his shirt front crumpled beyond all recovery, while his ear was bleeding profusely. Lord GrantoAvn glanced in alarm at his son, but, seeing that he was quite sensible, he recovered himself. 'Do I understand that he has struck you, Mr. Marshall ? ' he began, when the sight of that gentleman's face put any doubt out of the question. 'Ah, indeed, I see that he has. I am deeply grieved, deeply grieved.' ' I am sure of it, my lord, sure of it,' the other replied."], [259, "Broken Faith. 257 ' As for Avhat this young lady has said, I quite excuse it. She did not witness the first encounter, and unfortu nately arrived just when I was administering certainly a sound correction.' ' You struck me first ! ' panted Tempeston. ' I boxed your ears, young man ; and I think you Avill say I was justified, my lord, when I tell you the cause. He called me a spy, and said I was not a gentleman.' Lord Grantown was very particular in many things, and he was horrified to think his son should have addressed such words to one who was a dependant in the house. ' Did you say that, Tempest ? ' he exclaimed, more sternly than he had ever before spoken to his son, even in the old days. ' Yes,' said the boy faintly. 'Apologize instantly, then ! you are not a gentleman yourself, or you would not have uttered such a speech.' Tempeston was too hot and furious to do as he was told. ' I won't,' he retorted angrily. ' He isn't one, or he"], [260, "258 Wrong on both Sides. Avould not have come creeping into the room, as he did in here, Avhen Ave Avere speaking. He's a coAvard, and a bully too.' 'NoAvlistento me, Tempeston,' Lord GrantoAvn replied firmly. ' Such words addressed to Mr. Marshall I cannot overlook. You will apologize amply to him. Until you do so, you will not dine with us, and I forbid your sisters to speak to you a single word. You will not visit any of your friends, and, Avhen you go out, you Avill not go beyond the plantations. When in the house you will remain in your own apartment, and meals will be served to you there at the usual time. Now leave the room.' There was not a trace of anger in the speaker's voice, only something which made the boy know he must obey. Faint and exhausted, he rose to go ; but it Avas evident he was very weak. ' Papa, may I see him up-stairs ? ' Helen exclaimed, rising hastily. 'He is not strong, and he has been most dreadfully hurt.' Mr. Marshall did not relish the glance the girl shot at him as she spoke the last Avords."], [261, "Broken Faith. 259 ' No, Helen, I insist that you do not. I myself will go with him to his room. Will you kindly go to dinner ; the gong has sounded more than a quarter of an hour ago.' Tempeston had hardly got out into the hall, where the dining-room doors were open, and the servants standing wondering at the delay, before his father joined him. It was evident at a glance that the lad was sick and faint. The boy paused for a moment at the hall table to rest, and the next moment his senses nearly left him with surprise. Lord GrantoAvn had stooped, picked him up, and was carrying him up-stairs. On the landing near the schoolroom the pair fell in with Miss Emmett and Lina, both of whom uttered an exclama tion of horror. ' It's nothing,' Lord Grantown said. ' The boy forgot himself while I was out of the room, and struck his tutor. He has received his punishment ; rather more than he deserved, I believe.' ' I should think so,' exclaimed Miss Emmett, glancing at the white, exhausted youth. ' Lina,' said Lord Grantown, ' you will not speak to"], [262, "Wrong on both Sides. 260 your brother till I give you leave. Miss Emmett, you Avill kindly only address him Avhen necessary. Perhaps you will just open his door for me.' The lady did so, and was following the pair into the room, when Lord Grantown turned, saying, \u2014 ' I will help him to bed. Perhaps you will look in just to see he wants for nothing, in about an hour ? ' ' Certainly ;' and Miss Emmett withdrew. Very tenderly Lord Grantown laid his son on the couch, and then, turning, struck a match and lighted a pair of candles on the mantelpiece. It was years since the owner of the mansion had been in that apartment. He glanced round the room, which was very nicely furnished, and almost smiled at the numerous arrangements for comfort which the boy had made. His eye took in every detail, and, knowing the lad's allowance, he fairly started when they rested on the dressing-table covered with the silver and ivory contents of a magnificent dressing-case which stood thereon. Where on earth had the boy got such a thing?"], [263, "Broken Faith. 261 ' Tempest,' he said, ' where did you get this \u2014 these silver things from ? ' ' Lord Meltonbury,' the boy murmured faintly. The sound recalled the father to the bed. ' You must undress at once,' he said. His son made a few attempts, but he Avas so evidently done up that Lord Grantown lent his assist ance. Tired and weak as he was, somehoAV or another the youth recognised that it pleased his father to do this for him. How he knew it, he could not tell ; he simply understood that such was the case. Even his silk socks were taken off for him, and when he was ensconced in his neat little bed his father tucked him up carefully. ' Have you got all you want ? ' Lord Grantown asked. ' Y \u2014 yes,' said the boy, half crying. He wanted to tell his father how sorry he was ; but he couldn't. The latter understood it all, but he felt it was his duty that he should cause his son to apologize to Mr. Marshall, before coming to any terms with him himself. So he took no notice, merely saying, 'Some supper"], [264, "Wrong on both Sides. 262 Avill be sent up directly ; ' and then Tempeston was left alone. The meal Avas brought, and the boy ate and drank, and then Miss Emmett came in to see that all was right ; soon afterAvards the light was put out and the lad fell asleep. He half woke once, and fancied there had been a light in his eyes, and that some one had lifted the hair from his brow and kissed him, but he didn't know. It must have been a dream, though, because Emmett had kissed him when she Avent away at ten, and he had certainly heard the clock strike tAvo Avhen he half awoke. It could not be either Helen or Lina at that hour. ' Only a dream,' he murmured, and, turning over, he fell asleep again. Lord GrantoAvn softly descended the stairs"], [265, "CHAPTER XII, GOOD-BYE. jimf fpfEMPESTON woke with only a slight headache M^-j ;2|| the morning after his encounter with Mr. Marshall. Breakfast was brought to his apartment as soon as he had finished dressing, and then a message came from his father that he might go out for an hour in the morning and a couple of hours in the afternoon. It was a dull day to the boy, though he availed him self of the permission to walk. All his meals, like breakfast, were sent up to him, and no one came in to talk secretly. Miss Emmett, it is true, paid him a couple of visits, to know if he was quite well ; but even she was glum. The truth was that Lord Grantown 263"], [266, "264 Wrong on both Sides. had given the schoolroom party very positive orders to hold no communication with Tempeston. He had explained that it Avas absolutely necessary the boy should be made to apologize to his tutor, Avhile the sadness of his manner showed that no one was more oppressed at the captive's imprisonment than he Avho had ordered it. Miss Emmett told her pupils she thought their father quite right, and the girls sighed and did as they were bid. Once or twice during her visits to the boy's apart ment the governess implored him to obey his father. She strongly urged the point, saying that he was only punishing himself by not doing so ; and this was quite true. Miss Emmett knew something which Tempeston did not know, and which no one else kneAV. Lord GrantoAvn had closely questioned Helen as to Mr. Marshall's treatment of his son, and the father had communicated privately to the governess that, when the boy apologized, he meant to give the tutor his dismissal then and there. But Tempeston Avas angry, and Tempeston was proud. He Avould not give in. He Avould die rather,"], [267, "Good- Bye. 265 he told himself, than apologize to such a one as Mr. Marshall. Miserable, Avretched, and lonely as he was, still he Avould not yield. The days Avent by, and the lad remained nursing his anger and outraged feelings, either in the solitude of his OAvn room, or while wandering in the grounds. He Avondered and tortured himself in wondering what the Meltonburys Avould think of his never going to see them ; and yet he did not Avant to see them, \u2014 least of all did he Avish to meet Olga. Hoav completely he had failed ! In every respect, in everything he could, he had gone contrary to the promises he had given the girl under the trees in the Avater Avoods at Meltonbury. His friendship Avith her and her relations Avas over. He had promised and failed, promised and again failed. ' Oh, Tempest ! I did not think you Avould have broken your Avord to me.' Olga's remark came back to him, and with it the reneAval of the pledge beneath the green leaves. He Avas to have tried to be like Holme ! Well, that dream Avas over. Anything less like the dead boy's conduct s"], [268, "266 Wrong on both Sides. than his OAvn had been, he could not avcII imagine He Avould give up the Meltonburys, giA'e up Olga, and his good resolutions. He had failed tAvice, and Avould struggle no more. If the girl came over, and he saAv her, and she urged him to apologize, as he was certain she Avould, then he AA'ould refuse. He had tried to be good and failed, failed miserably. Now he Avould return to his old ways, and be like he Avas at Eton, Avhen he did not trouble his head about anything but pleasing himself. His mind Avas made up. After the lamentable result of his attempts at doing better, he Avould struggle no more. But the Meltonburys and Olga ? Well, he must say good-bye to them, like everything else that Avas good. After all, he had done very well without them before he knew them, and it Avas a great bore trying to be better than other fellows. It Avas one fine afternoon, an hour after luncheon, and a week exactly from the date of the scene in the library, that Tempeston, lying on the sofa in his room, came to the above resolutions. He had just arrived at the last conclusion, Avhen the sound of hoofs made him"], [269, "Good- Bye. 267 start. In a moment he Avas at the window, and in time to see Olga riding up to the house, folloAved by a groom. Tempeston's heart beat fast. He heard the door bell ring, and in a minute or tAvo the horses Avere being led up and doAvn the gravel sweep in front of the house. The girl had come in, then, and was probably Avith his sister Helen, or in the schoolroom. Those stupid people were sure to let out something about it ! He Avould get out of the way at once, or he might be sent for, if Olga thought of asking Lord GrantoAvn's leave. The boy took his hat and crept down stairs. Tempeston did not come across any one in his flight through the hall, and, once outside, he felt compara tively safe. If they did call from the big schoolroom Avindow, he could pretend not to hear. No one, how ever, interfered Avith him, and he Avent doAvn the road to the stables, and then along a broad path through the plantations, till he came to a great gate with a padlock on it. This gate led into a private lane, rarely used. In the time of Lord GrantoAvn's grandfather, it"], [270, "268 Wrong on both Sides. Avas the way to the kennels ; but these had long since disappeared. From disuse, the grass had groAvn upon the path, and the only person Avhose footsteps ever trod there once in six months Avas Tempeston. The boy used it because he could go to Shirley Park that way, it being just about the same distance as by the high road, and possessing the great attraction of run ning part of the way alongside the raihvay. Indeed, for nearly half a mile, there Avas no barrier, even in the shape of a fence, betAveen the grass-groAvn, deserted lane and the iron lines along Avhich the express trains used to rush. Tempeston only Avent to Shirley by the private path Avhen he Avas Avalking. His father had ahvays strictly forbidden his riding there, as, at such close quarters, a horse might Avell be excused if frightened by the noise of the engines. The day, hoAv ever, of Avhich I Avrite, Tempeston had no intention of going to Shirley. He simply meant to walk doAvn, and wait to see a train or two pass. That Avould probably fill up the time of Olga's visit, and then he could return in safety to the house. The boy undid the padlock, and pushed the iron"], [271, "Good- Bye. 269 gate open. He Avould not shut it. He Avould be returning in an hour or so, and no one ever came that Avay. He went on a little, Avhen the sound of a horse snorting, close behind, caused him to start and look round. It Avas Olga, mounted on her chestnut mare. The boy, as he took off his hat, grew very red, and looked about for some Avay of escape. The road, just at that point, was lined on either side by two great banks, croAvned with high hedges, \u2014 more like a Devon shire than a Dorsetshire lane. It was, therefore, absolutely impossible for him to get aAvay. Olga greeted the lad Avith a little laugh, though her face looked very grave. ' Hoav do you do ? ' she said, stretching out a delicate hand, enveloped in a natty little gauntlet. ' If Nelly had not snorted like that, I should have come up beside you without your seeing me.' ' How did you knoAV where I Avas ? ' the boy asked rather roughly. ' I saAv you go off, from the schoolroom Avindow. By the time I had said good-bye to the others, you had had a little start ; but Helen, whom I told that"], [272, "Jffoug on both Sides. 270 I Avanted to see you, guessed Avhere you had gone, and described the Avay I Avas to folloAV. This is the road that comes out near the lodge at Shirley, is it not, and runs by the railway ? I thought so. Helen says you like to Avatch the trains pass ! I did not think you were such a big baby, Tempest.' Olga gave quite a merry little laugh. She had pulled up, and was looking doAvn at her companion. The children formed a striking picture, \u2014 the girl, in her short habit, Avith her golden locks and lovely grey eyes, sitting firmly in her saddle ; and the boy, Avith his big blue orbs and flushed handsome face, looking up at her. There Avas a little silence, and then Olga said, \u2014 ' Do you knoAV, Tempest, Avhy I folloAved ? I a\\ rant you to do something for me? Will you? I Avant you to come back to the house ; tell Mr. Marshall you are sorry ; then order your horse, and ride back Avith me to Shirley to dinner. Your servant can easily bring your things.' The boy shook his head. ' Oh, but you must ! ' Olga went on. ' I know you"], [273, "Good-Bye. 271 Avon't refuse me, and, besides, I want some one to come and take care of me on the Avay back. You see I have sent my groom home, because I could not bring him here Avhen I Avanted to talk to you like this. Say you'll come.' ' I'll come, but I won't apologize.' ' That cannot be, Tempest. Your father Avould not alloAv it, and I should refuse to let you ride with me.' ' All right. I don't want to.' ' Tempest, I think you are very unkind. Ah, do, dear boy ; do as I ask. You'll be ever so much happier. I can see you are miserable now. Come back, and tell the man you are sorry, and then we will order your horse and be off directly. I have such lots to tell you, and you must come to take care of me, because Nelly shied tAvice, riding over. Fancy Nelly, Avho never shies ! ' ' I tell you I'll come, but I Avon's apologize.

Then you can just say Iioav sorry you are, and everything Avill be right.' ' No, I Avon's.,' retorted Tempeston. Pride and Anger, those tAvo ugly spirits, were there in the quiet lane. The boy did not knoAV it, did not think about it ; but they were there, all the same. ' Ah, Tempest, do \u2014 for my sake,' Olga pleaded. The last three Avords nearly overcame the boy ; but alas ! he had dallied with those black sprites too long to rid himself of them easily.

' Not again, Tempest ! ' The big grey eyes were open wide with surprise, and the beautiful young face looked very sad. ' Not again, Tempest dear !

The boy was conscious of a disagreeable lump in his throat, while the glimpse of the sad, sorroAvful little face looking down nearly finished him altogether. He wouldn't look there again. If he did, he might be led into humiliating himself to that odious man ; and he Avould rather die than that, he thought. ' It's no use talking,' he broke forth at length. ' I never, never will apologize to that fellow, as long as I"], [276, "Wrong on both Sides. 274 live.

' ' Tempest,' exclaimed Olga very gravely, ' I did not think you could speak to me like that ! you, an Eton boy and a gentleman ! ' The rebuke stung Tempeston, and he felt he had justly deserved it ; but unfortunately he was one who, Avhen he had lost his temper, generally lost it still more because he Avas annoyed at having done so at all. As usual, on this occasion he plunged still deeper into the angry stream. ' I Avon's talk any more,' he ansAvered roughly.

I'm sick to death of your preaching, and I don't mean to stand it any more \u2014 there ! ' Tempeston, at the conclusion of these words, turned round, and began to stride back toAvards home. He did not glance at the girl, so he never saAv that she Avas Aveeping bitterly. He Avas mad Avith rage at him self for behaving as he had, and scarcely knew what he Avas doing. He had not gone many paces, Avhen the mare Avas beside him. ' Stop, Tempest ! ' Olga exclaimed.

The Avhole thing Avas so sudden, that Olga had not moved, had not realized Avhat Avas being done, till she saw herself shut out. She trotted quickly to the gate then. ' Tempest,' she exclaimed, ' let me through ! I have only an hour to spare. Papa is going to London by the five o'clock train, as he has to start for Balmoral to-night.

Olga chose the former. She could not let her father go for a Avhole fortnight with out saying good-bye. She turned Nelly round, and set off down the park, trusting that no trains Avould pass Avhile she Avas near the line. We Avill noAv return to Tempeston. For the first ten minutes after he had left Olga, he walked forward, not knowing Avhere he was going. His brain was confused. He cursed himself for his conduct, and in doing so acknoAvledged that he had been a blackguard and no gentleman. What Avould Lord Meltonbury say Avhen his daughter related Avhat had taken place that afternoon ? Very likely he Avould come over at the first opportunity, and thrash a felloAv who had treated a young girl as he had treated Olga. What Avould the boys at Eton have said to him ? What Avould Emmett, and Helen, and Lina say? Stop, though, very likely Olga Avould not tell ! Had she ever"], [282, "280 Wrong on both Sides. done anything unkind? Oh, Avhat a fool he had been ! Tempeston had got so far in his reflections, when he found himself at the point Avhere the road from the plantations joined the drive leading up to the house. He turned quickly back. He did not Avant to be seen ; he wanted, instead, to be alone and think Avhat Avas best to be done. So Tempeston began to retrace his steps, and he had hardly done so before the idea struck him that, if he did not really Avish to forfeit his character as a gentleman completely, he must go back and open the gate for Olga. He had begun to repent of the act a second after it Avas done, but it Avas only after ten minutes' reflection that the full enormity of his offence seemed to strike him. He set off running, as soon as he had made up his mind. The boy Avas fleet of foot ; indeed, his room Avas filled with cups Avon in the playing fields at Eton, engraved Avith such inscriptions as ' The Quarter Mile,' 'The Mile,' 'The Half Mile.' As he bounded doAvn the steep hill, the dreadful thought occurred \u2014 Avhat if Olga had really gone by the lane ? He kneAV hoAv close the path Avas"], [283, "Good-Bye. 281 to the raihvay. Fancy, if Nelly shied ! Fancy, if Olga was thrown and hurt ! It was too horrid to think of for a moment ! He put it away from him ; nevertheless he increased his speed, and, just five minutes after his determination to return, he reached the padlocked gate. He had been gone, in all, a quarter of an hour. The boy looked through the iron bars eagerly, whilst unfastening the lock ; but there was no Olga to be seen. A few yards farther, and the lane turned sharply to the left, and from that point he could gain a vieAv of the road for at least half a mile. In less than a minute Tempeston was standing, panting for breath, on the spot. No, there was no one in sight. Olga had dis appeared ; and, if she had ridden quickly, \u2014 and she probably Avould, wishing to see her father before he started, \u2014 the girl by that time must be half-way to Shirley. It was useless to follow. He was a dis graceful little blackguard, and if the Meltonburys never spoke to him again it would serve him perfectly right. Sadly, Tempeston walked back, locked the gate, and T"], [284, "Wrong on both Sides. 282 then, flinging himself doAvn on the grass, gave himself up to thought. What had he done ? What had not his silly pride and violent temper led him into? He had quarrelled with his best friend \u2014 his dear, dear little Olga. A great lump rose in the boy's throat when the thought of the girl's kind words came back to him, and after such disgraceful conduct as his ! And, with this, came also the remembrance of Avhat he had dared to say about the dead Holme \u2014 the Holme whose name was never mentioned, save softly, as though it meant some sacred thing ! ' I don't want to be like him. He was a muff, I knoAV.' What Avords \u2014 what words to have used about the dead ! That was the Avay he had repaid the kindness of Lord and Lady Meltonbury and Olga ! Well, he had killed that friendship for ever. He Avould never see Lord Meltonbury's kind eyes looking doAvn at him, or walk arm-in-arm with him again. It Avasn't likely. The thought Avas too much for Tempeston, and he burst out sobbing."], [285, "Good-Bye. 283 Long did the lad lie on the soft grass, taking no heed of time or anything else. Once he raised his head from his arms, and that was when he heard, in the distance, the Avhistle of a train. He took out his Avatch. It Avas five o'clock, and that, of course, was the express which Avas to take Lord Meltonbury to town. He laid his head down again wearily, with a great sigh, and Avent on thinking about his misery ; and while he was so thinking, exhausted by passion and its after-fatigue, he fell fast asleep. It was very dark when the lad woke, with a great start. He had been dreaming; but about what he could not remember, only it seemed as if it had been something horrid, for he felt frightened. He pulled out his watch and peered at it through the fast deepen ing twilight Twenty-five minutes to seven ! He had left the house at three, and it was part of his punish ment that he should not stay out more than two hours at a time. What would his father say?

He remained sitting on the grass, which was wet"], [286, "Wrong on both Sides. 284 Avith the evening dew, and began to think about his troubles. All at once a brilliant idea flashed across the boy's brain. If he went home, and straightway apologized to Mr. Marshall, very likely his father would alloAV him to go to Shirley that same evening. Once there, he Avould see Olga, and then he Avould go doAvn on his knees, and beg her to forgive him and forget Avhat he had said. That, he felt sure, was Avhat Holme Avould have done, if Holme had ever been as naughty and Avicked as he had been. By asking Mr. Marshall's pardon he Avould show Olga he was in earnest. Yes, he would beg the tutor's pardon, and that of his father, he determined, and anybody's else's they liked, \u2014 the butler's, even, if it pleased them, though he hadn't done the butler any wrong. He would do all this \u2014 anything \u2014 so that he might be allowed to go to Shirley, for he suddenly felt as if he must, at any cost, see Olga that night and beg forgiveness. The resolution once taken, the boy jumped to his feet and began running home as fast as he could. He did not feel very unhappy then, for he knevv Olga"], [287, "Good-Bye. 285 so Avell that he felt pretty sure she Avould not tell her father about him. Olga never, never did what was unkind. She would forgive him, and then, what should he do ? How should he thank her ? He knew. He would tell her that he would be a brother to her, try, really try this time, to grow something like dead Holme ; and then \u2014 then he Avould seal his promise Avith a kiss. To be sure, he had never done such a thing before, but he felt that such a promise and such a reconciliation must have something special about it. Tempeston emerged from the wood just then, and bounded along the gravel drive and out on to the sweep before the house. He was dashing quickly up to the portico when he heard, with a great start, his father's voice calling. ' Tempest ! Tempest ! Is that you ? The sound came from under the grey pillars. The hall- door was open, and in the lamplight the lad saw Lord Grantown's figure. ' Yes,' he answered, ' it's me, papa.' He reached the steps, ran up, and was beside his father in a minute."], [288, "Wrong on both Sides. 286 'Papa,' he began, but Lord Grantown cut him short. ' Have you been there ? have you heard ?

It was eleven o'clock on the evening of the same day in which the event recorded in the last chapter had taken place. There was only one other occupant of the chamber besides the invalid and these two, and that was Lord Grantown. The nobleman was sitting on the bed, supporting his son in his arms, while the young head rested on his shoulder. Tempeston's eyes were closed. He heard the doctor's voice, and then relapsed into a state of semi-unconsciousness. Let us for a moment folloAV 2bS"], [291, "Gates Ajar. 289 the lad into the dim mist of his Avanderinsr thoughts. Something had happened, but, save that it Avas some thing terrible, he could not tell what it was that had occurred. He was in bed, and there were people in the room, because he had been ill. What had made him ill ? Who was it holding him so tenderly in his arms ? He opened his eyes and saw his father. ' My boy, my poor boy ! ' said Lord Grantown, stooping down and kissing him. Why was he ' poor.' His father had called him ' poor ' and kissed him ! He couldn't understand it at all. His father had never kissed him before. He Avas ill ; perhaps he was dying ! This last thought roused the lad. It was like the word he Avanted to supply a missing link, \u2014 not dying, but dead ! Some one was dead ; and then with a low, moaning cry the knoAvledge of the past came back. It was Olga who was dead ! It was he who had murdered her, when he sent her back by the road near the railway. A murderer! He had read about such beings in the newspapers, but he had never dreamed that he"], [292, "Wrong on both Sides. 290 should be one himself. Murderers were tried. He had seen pictures of such trials.

' Father,' he said faintly, ' put me aAvay from you. Don't touch me. I am not fit.' Lord Grantown smiled. ' That's all forgotten, my boy,' he said tenderly.

It was necessary that he should explain that he Avas a murderer. ' Tempest,' said his father, ' there has been a message to know how you are.

'Anything the matter, my boy?' asked the physi cian kindly, and laying a big cool hand on the invalid's forehead. Tempeston did not seem to hear the question. He was looking straight before him then, apparently lost in a sudden train of thought. At length he started, as though he had come to some fixed purpose, and said hurriedly to the doctor, \u2014 ' Am I very ill ? ' ' Almost well,' was the reply. ' What has been the matter with me ?

The governess left the apartment, and in a feAv moments returned with the required article, which she placed on a table beside the boy's bed.

It was Olga, he kneAV, who had suggested it to them ; because once he had happened to say, when riding up St. James's Street, how jolly the bags and cases looked in Jenner and Knewstub's window.

Very softly, for fear of Avaking any one, he crept along, passed Miss Emmett's door, passed Helen and Lina's rooms, \u2014 what AA-ould they feel Avhen they should learn what he had done ? \u2014 and then he descended the stairs. The swing door into the hall opened Avithout noise, and he Avalked quickly across the great place, and, sliding back the bolts, opened the portal. He closed it gently after him, and, stepping out from under the portico, found himself in the open air, Avith the stars glittering brightly overhead. The fresh night air revived the boy for a minute, and he got a little Avay from the house without much difficulty ; but soon he began to shiver Avith cold. Hoav strange it seemed to be Avalking along under the great trees, and hoAv different the park looked from Avhat it did in the day-time !

How he Avould run and unfasten it, cling to the girl, praying for forgiveness, and she \u2014 she would give it, as she had ever done. Oh, Father in heaven, undo the evil !

There was not a fragment of hope that it could be untrue. The very doctor who had seen her had pronounced her dead, and had come aAvay because he could do nothing. But if Olga was dead, at least let it not be his fault, not be through his own vile temper. Perhaps she might have chosen to have gone by that lane ! Pshaw ! how could that be ?

Suddenly"], [304, "Wrong on both Sides. 302 there flashed to the boy's mind the remembrance of some of those quaint stories about ansAvers to prayer which his father had so often related at Sunday evening devotions. Vague recollections of droAvning men, in mid-ocean, calling to God for help, and being saved by a plank floating near; or of travellers falling from a orecipice, uttering a prayer, and being caught in a bush and draAvn up alive, unhurt. The ex-Eton boy had hitherto regarded such tales in a slightly sceptical Avay, and had listened Avith a half smile. It Avas not that he Avas an irreligious lad ; on the contrary, he was rather the reverse. UnknoAvn to any one, he ahvays read his Bible daily, and he accepted much greater miracles Avithout a doubt. His scepticism on this point Avas only, I fancy, because the tracts belonged to his father, and he kneAA', or thought he kneAV, that Lord GrantoAvn never took the slightest trouble to find out if the stories therein contained Avere authentic. But that night in his extremity the boy did not feel inclined to smile. No help that any man could give Avould avail ; One, and One alone, could, if He chose, lend assistance. Tempeston glanced up at"], [305, "Gates Ajar. 303 the mighty host of stars above his head. Surely the Maker of them could do Avonderful things ! He knelt doAvn on the dripping grass and asked, in a few simple Avords, of the great Father of all that somehoAv he might be released, that a portion of his misery might be taken from him. Then he rose and resumed his Avalk. The echo of the stable clock striking three reached Tempeston's ears just as he had quietly opened the gate at the lodge, and stepped out on to the high road. He had thus tAvo miles still before him to Shirley. It Avas a terrible journey, that, to the boy who a feAv hours before had broken a blood-vessel, and who toiled on Avith the knoAvledge of the tale he had to unfold to Lord Meltonbury at the end ! Several times he sank exhausted to the ground at the side of the road, and once or twice his mouth filled with blood. Just at five o'clock, Avhen the first streak of dawn appeared in the east, Tempeston arrived at the Avell-knoAvn lodge-gate. He recalled Avith agony hoAv often he had ridden gaily through it Avhen going over to pay a visit ; frequently the sole object of such visit being to see Olga, and ask"], [306, "Wrong on both Sides. 304 her advice as to what he ought to do in this or that case. He lifted the latch, shut the gate, and Avent quickly on up the drive. The grey light was increasing every moment, his journey was nearly over, his task about to begin. Faster and faster his heart beat, his brain seemed to Avhirl, and he thought for a moment that this Avas death. The lad leaned for support against a tree. The feeling passed aAvay almost immediately, and he felt stronger again. He was sorry for that. He had suffered such agony for his sin, that surely God Avould have pardoned him had he died, and then there would have been an end to all his wretchedness. But it Avas not to be. He pulled himself together, and staggered, rather than Avalked, omvard for a feAv paces, and then the house came in sight. The blinds Avere drawn in all the AvindoAvs ; the stillness of death Avas on the place. In one of those shut-up rooms Olga lay dead. The boy Avondered vaguely which room it Avas. He felt as if he had hardly realized, till he saAv that array of Avhite blinds, that she Avas actually gone. Standing before the"], [307, "Gates Ajar. 305 mansion, Avith the hushed stillness all around him, he kneAV in very truth that she was dead. Could she see him, then, from her place among the angels, he won dered ? He didn't knoAV ; all he was sure of was that she was now one of God's bright hosts. Tempeston had just thought this, when one of the casements near him opened, a blind was thrust aside, and, with an agonizing pang at his heart, the boy beheld Lord Meltonbury. He never kneAV how he got there, but in another moment he was before the bereaved father, and had sunk exhausted on the ground at his feet. ' Tempest ! ' The word came in a tone of amazement. Lord Meltonbury had heard that the lad before him had broken a blood-vessel but a few hours ago, and was dangerously ill. He was naturally startled to see him there. He gazed in astonishment at the young figure, soiled with the dust of the road on Avhich he had sunk down so often, and with the red blood dripping from his mouth. ' My child ! ' he exclaimed, as he lifted the half-"], [308, "Wrong on both Sides. 306 fainting lad, and carried him back into the room ; ' hoAv came you here ? ' ' I Avalked,' panted the boy. ' Don't touch me \u2014 keep aAvay \u2014 I did it \u2014 I killed her ! ' To Lord Meltonbury the Avords were those of delirium. He forgot for a moment the agony of his OAvn broken heart. 'Hush, hush!' he said; 'you are ill, dear child,' and again he sought to lift the boy from the crouching position into Avhich he had sunk upon the floor. ' Don't,' exclaimed Tempeston, Avith a great shudder ; ' I am not mad. It is the truth I tell.' Lord Meltonbury gazed in astonishment at the speaker. The boy's blue eyes were open wide ; a look of horror was in them, but there was no delirium there. What did the lad mean ? ' Tempest,' he gasped, ' I do not understand. What is it you Avould say ? ' ' I did it,' moaned the lad. ' I killed her. It Avas I Avho sent her to her death ! Oh, Olga ! oh, darling Olga ! '"], [309, "Gates Ajar. 307 Something in the speaker's tone told Lord Melton bury that, whatever it Avas that Avas meant, the boy believed the truth of his OAvn words. It was clearly his duty to unravel the mystery, to find out if the dusty, blood-stained figure that lay prone at his feet could, by any possibility, have had a share in the terrible tragedy of the previous afternoon. ' Tell me,' he exclaimed sternly, ' Avhat is it you mean ? Speak ! I order you.' The boy lifted his Avhite face, and gazed at Lord Meltonbury. In the dim light of the room, behind the closed blinds, the lad saAv how fearfully his kind friend had altered in one short night. He was dressed in a travelling suit, \u2014 the one he had been wearing for the journey on which he was about to start, Avhen the aAvful nevvs reached him. His hair, Avhich formerly had been tinged with grey, had groAvn white ; and his beard was of the same hue. The features, too, AA'ere draAvn and sharpened, Avhile his whole attitude was that of a man stricken by a bloAv from which he Avould never recover. ' Speak !

Oh, if I Avere dead ! I Avish that I had died, oh, long ago ! ' He paused, Avringing his hands and moaning. ' Go on,' gasped Lord Meltonbury ; ' Avhat then ? Hoav Avas it your fault ? Speak !

It may have been minutes, it may have been hours. He Avas roused at last by some one lifting him tenderly up, and in another moment he Avas lying"], [311, "Gates Ajar. 309 in Lord Meltonbury's arms, and the kind voice of the latter Avas speaking to him. ' My boy,' he said, ' it is all a mistake. Our darling was killed here, close to the house. It was the thrash ing-machine engine, Tempest, Avhich frightened the mare. The men got up steam soon after she had ridden aAvay to see you. It Avas working near the stables. It's all a mistake.' The room Avhirled round Avith the boy, but still his senses did not quite leave him. ' And I have not done it after all ? ' he cried, in a shrill voice, Avhich sounded still shriller in the stillness of the early morning. ' I have not killed her ? I am not a murderer ? ' ' Thank God, no ! ' exclaimed Lord Meltonbury, holding the lad closer to himself. ' He heard my prayer ! ' the boy Avent on, his eyes looking straight before him, Avith an almost super natural light in them. ' I knelt upon the grass in the park \u2014 how wet the grass is in the early morning ! \u2014 I cried to Him to be released, and He has heard me, and forgiven. Oh, thank God \u2014 thank Gcd ! '"], [312, "3 1 o Wrong on both Sides. The half delirious Avords startled Lord Meltonbury. ' Tempest,' he said, trying by a calm voice to recall the young felloAv to himself, ' can you hear me ? Can you understand a message if I give it to you ? ' ' A message ! ' repeated the lad stupidly ; ' a message from Avhom ? ' ' From our darling,' Lord Meltonbury replied. ' She did not die at once. They carried her into the hall, and she Avas sensible. You say that you were angry Avith her; well, this is her message: \"Tell Tempest not to mind. Tell him I am very sorry he was vexed. Ask him to be like Holme. Say good-bye for me to him, and tell him I'm not a bit cross.\" She said the last Avords twice, my boy, and then she gave a sort of little moan \u2014 and it Avas over.' Lord Meltonbury's voice trembled at the last words, and a deep sob issued from his breast ; but, sincere as Tempeston's affection for him was, the lad neither heard nor noticed it. He lay still, lost almost in a transport of joy rather than sorrow. The terrible taint of murder Avas gone from him, and, deeply as he had sinned by Avild, passionate anger, still from the shed-"], [313, "Gates Ajar. 311 ding of blood he Avas free. In his thankfulness he could almost have shouted aloud. And, as though this release was not enough, there had come the message of pardon, of SAveet forgiveness, and of comfort from the dead ! ' Tell Tempest I am sorry he Avas vexed. Ask him to be like Holme. Say good-bye for me to him. Tell him not to mind.' This was the farewell message from the child to him, who, if he had done no real harm, had at least risked her life by sending her back by that dangerous road. And after that, even, she did not despair of him ! ' Tell him to be like Holme.' There was hope for him yet. It was not all too late, as he had thought. He Avanted to go and see Olga, and Avhisper to her that henceforth he Avould strive, with all his might, to do the things she wished, and seek to walk in the steps of the dead young earl. ' Holme always did what was right,' the girl had said that summer day beneath the green trees in the Avater woods at Meltonbury. He, God helping, would do the same. ' Take me to her now,' the boy said slowly ; and"], [314, "Wrong on both Sides. 312 Lord Meltonbury arose Avithout a word, and led the way. The glory of the early sunrise lightened all the room, and, stealing through the Venetian blinds, fell in bright rays upon the snoAV-white couch and the form that lay beneath the sheet. Gently, very gently, Lord Melton bury dreAv back the cover, and Tempeston, with a smothered cry, sank down beside the bed. It Avas Olga, Olga unchanged, Olga looking just as she did in life \u2014 only a thousand times more beautiful ! There Avas the little head, Avith the short curly golden locks, Avhich the boy had admired so much, and about Avhich he had been wont to teaze her. There were the trailing silky lashes, the rosy lips, the beautiful complexion, all just as in life \u2014 save that the soft grave eyes Avere closed to open never any more till the last great Easter daAvn. ' Olga,' the boy Avhispered, ' I want to tell you some thing, to tell you I am very sorry. I mean to groAv like Holme, dear, and always try to do Avhat you AA'Ould like. You do forgive me, Olga darling, I knoAV, because you sent to tell me so ; and oh, I thank you,"], [315, "Gates Ajar. 313 dear ! I'll try to be very good, Olga, and then perhaps, because I am so miserable, God will let me die soon, and Ave shall be together ahvays, dear, you and I. The road seemed so long here, and I am tired, darling. I think that I shall sleep, noAV that I have seen you. I Avanted so to see you once again, dear ; and oh, please give my love to Holme ! for, though I didn't really knoAV him, still I seem to do so through you. I think she will like me to send my love to Holme ? ' he added, looking up at Lord Meltonbury half-inquiringly. The tall figure signed, as though he, too, had thought the same. ' I don't Avant to leave you, Olga,' the boy went on, turning back towards the still, quiet face, on Avhich God's angels had drawn the sAveetest smile, ' but I am ill. I Avill come back soon, only noAv my eyes are heavy, and I want to sleep. Good-bye, darling ! I may kiss her, may I not ? ' He looked up at Lord Meltonbury as he asked the question, and again the figure signed assent. Then, for the first time, the boy laid his pure young lips on Olga's icy ones The next minute there was a x"], [316, "Wrong on both Sides. 314 Ioav Availing cry, and the lad was stretched senseless on the ground. Tavo years have passed aAvay since that day, and there has come but little outward change in the lives of the inhabitants of Grantown Castle. Helen, it is true, is married, and lives happily at S \u2014 1 \u2014 b \u2014 ry, in the cathedral close, Avith her husband, a talented and Avealthy canon. The match excited no opposition on the part of Lord Grantown, and he and his son-in-law are the best of friends, though the latter steadily declines to accept his father-in-law's theories for the destruction of modern infidelity. Lina, under Miss Emmett's care, progresses in the path of learning, and is well and happy ; while the governess's hair is beginning to get grey, and she daily grows more beloved and esteemed by all at the castle. The master of the house is very well. He is yet a stern-looking man at first sight; but after a minute's conversation the stranger generally notes a kindly light of interest in the piercing eye. He gives largely in charity from his not too ample rent-roll, and he is"], [317, "Gates Ajar. 3 1 5 regarded as the best landlord in all Dorsetshire. It is true, as I have said, that he is still persuaded of the excellence of his OAvn peculiar theories, but he is less impatient with those who decline to adopt them. He has learned that there is, perhaps, something in the charge Avhich has so often been brought against his schemes, that they are impracticable, and his endea vours are now directed to making them more in accordance with what is called the spirit of the age. He is ahvays to be seen in the Upper House whenever a debate of an ecclesiastical character is on, but Avhen it is over he thinks but little more about it. Lord GrantoAvn has hardly eyes or ears for anything but his son. Long ago Tempeston told him the story of the padlocked gate, while his arm was round the boy's neck. Then, when the tale was finished, the father lifted up his voice and blessed the Maker of all in that he had dealt gently Avith his son. No more, no more, in the great hall is to be heard the sound of a boy's gay laugh, no longer do feet bound doAvn the stairs or resound along the corridor. Silently, sadly the heir to all glides about, when not"], [318, "Wrong on both Sides. 316 engaged at study. There is a new tutor, and he Avorks diligently Avith him for a couple of hours daily, but that is all he is allowed to do. When, in Olga's death chamber, he fell senseless to the ground, it was the beginning of a brain fever, in Avhich first life and then reason were despaired of. He recovered at length, but, since that night of agony when he believed himself the cause of his beloved young friend's death, Tem peston has been completely changed. His father is ever at his side, and the boy is tenderly attached to him, and seeks to learn what the duties of his position Avill require of him hereafter. But it is easy to see that he learns from a sense of duty only, and that he has no interest or pleasure in his life. The shock of that night, the doctors say, was too much for him. The boy spends much of his time at Meltonbury, where the marquis and his wife now live, and where, in the family vault, lie both their children. To the bereaved couple he is as a son, and they have never forgotten one of Olga's dying requests, \u2014 ' Take care of Tempest' The lad, if he lives, will be very wealthy, for, though"], [319, "Gates Ajar. 317 Meltonbury House, the title, and rent-roll, all, of course, pass to the heir-at-law, a distant cousin in India, Shirley Park, Avhich is not entailed, and all else that Lord Meltonbury can leave, will descend to Viscount Tempeston, only son and heir of the Earl of Grantown. But for Avealth and honours the boy cares nothing. He is devoted to his family and friends, and daily his sad smile grows sweeter, his patience greater. Never since the afternoon of that terrible tragedy at Shirley has an angry word been known to pass his lips. He has but one object here, and that is to walk in the steps of the young Lord Holme. Ever he strives to do this, seeks and prays to fulfil the duties of his state of life ; but his thoughts and his hopes are far aAvay. He looks onward to the time when health, broken by that awful shock and regret for a past beyond recall, shall be no more. When death shall come, and death rolling back the golden gates which bar the way to life eternal, there, in the splendour of the everlasting morn, he shall once again behold Olga, and see Holme standing by her side."], [320, "318 Wrong on both Sides. And then, Avhen words of joyous Avelcome have greeted him, these three shall pass along the streets of paved gold, and hear the Avhite-robed harpers sing their Avondrous song, until at length his eyes shall see the sight that croAvns the triumph \u2014 'The King in His beauty.'
