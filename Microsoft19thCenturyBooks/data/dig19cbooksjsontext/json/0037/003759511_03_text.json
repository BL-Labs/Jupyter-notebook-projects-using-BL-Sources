It is Squire West ! \" exclaimed both men simultaneously, when in less than three minutes they knelt beside the huddled mass, their own reins flun\" to the roucsli brown hands of a smock-frocked clown Avith staring eyes. William gently raised to his knee the hand some head from which hat and peruke had fallen, and hurriedly bade another fellow bring Avater from the nearest spring, whilst Eoper loosened the falling neckcloth of em broidered lawn, already flecked with blood, and then from a private \" pocket-pistol,\" charged Avith Hollands that did not smack of the Custom-house, drop by drop poured the potent spirit betAveen teeth loosened and bleeding from the fall. vol. in. 34"], [12, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 2 It gurgled in his throat. The sharply out lined face remained livid and ghastly. Was William Hutton's memory playing him tricks, or was that the aspect of all dying men, he was so forcibly reminded of old Mr. Webb in his last hours? Yet Squire West Avas a stalwart man in the very prime of life. \"Are any bones broken, think you?\" he questioned, shaking off his vague fancy. A groan followed Eoper's attempt to straighten limbs. \" At all eA-ents he's alive,\" he answered. \" Here ! \" And again the \" pocket-pistol \" went to the blue lips. Before a mouthful could be swallowed or the countryman come back with water in his hat to dash in the white face, horsemen from the race-course came riding up pell-mell with a lady in their midst, who with a shriek flung herself from her horse and casting herself on the ground besides the helpless form, cried out in agonizing accents, \" Oh, Philip, Philip ! Oh, my darling hus band ! He is dead, he is dead ! That vile woman hath been the death of him ! \" There was a slight quiver of the nostrils, a faint flicker of the eyelids \u2014 either her voice or the clasp of her warm hand on his had been more potent than the Hollands. The closely shaven head still rested against"], [13, "TWO ROADS TO GAOL. 3 Mr. Hutton's knee. \" No, madam,\" said he reassuringly. \" Thank Heaven, the squire is living, but he is seriously hurt. He needs a surgeon \u2014 and must' have air. Pray do not crowd him,\" and he waved back the group of sporting squires and dashing bucks who pressed too closely, some of whom scowled at him as if asking, \" Who is this fellow taking so much upon himself? \" A doctor Avas not far to seek. In less than a couple of minutes Dr. Davison was on the spot. From the summit of the hill at the commencement of the Mansfield Eoad he had witnessed a singularly gaunt gipsyish woman throw herself almost in the path of Squire West, then leaving the race-course in advance of his excited party. Her object appeared to be fortune-telling. Moodily repulsed, she vociferated loudly something, of which he only caught, \" An eye for an eye, a life for a life, A childless mother, a widowed wife,\" as she flung up her arms with wild gesticula tions, and swept her wide brimmed hat in the very eyes of his fiery young hunter. The horse reared, swerved, plunged forward, and was gone like the Avind, leaving the fleetest pursuer far behind. The doctor had put spurs in the sides of his 34\u20142"], [14, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 4 OAvn comfortable cob and foHowed, though not before he had seen rough hands laid on the violent Avoman who had dived ineffectu ally among the crowd for concealment. In less time than it has taken to tell this, the doctor had gently moved the sobbing lady from her injured husband's side, in Ioav tones questioned William Hutton, Avhom he knew, and made a brief examination. Madam West, with strained and streaming eyes, clasped her hands together and breath lessly waited the result ; and as the doctor's manipulation caused the squire to groan, she swayed to and fro, and wailed, \" Oh, Philip, my love, my love. If I lose thee I lose all,\" wringing her helpless hands in agony. \" There are no limbs broken,\" said the doctor, after another appeal to Eoper's spirit flask had brought a sign of returning con sciousness, \" but we must get the squire home, madam, his injuries are internal \u2014 and I fear his spine is hurt,\" he Avhispered in a loAver key to the two men who still supported the prostrate form. But madam caught the words, and again threw herself beside him in unutterable anguish. There Avas a hasty consultation. The catas trophe had sobered those who had drunk the deepest during the day. Boughs were hurriedly torn down and their leafy branches"], [15, "TWO ROADS TO GAOL. 5 interlaced to form a litter, ferns cropped to supply a bed. At that juncture a chariot and six came lumbering up. \" My carriage and Bestwood house are at the disposal of Madam West and the squire,\" volunteered the oAvner. The offer could only be courteously declined. At the chariot door the doctor whispered as an apology : \" I fear the jolting of a vehicle on this shameful road Avould be fatal.\" And his glance said more than his words. \" Home,\" faintly fell from the sufferer's pallid lips. \" Home,\" urged the white and trembling Avife, alone amongst a crowd of men. But home Avas miles away, and though the litter lay upon the turf it Avas a delicate and difficult task to lift the heaA-y and helpless frame of the big man upon it, the slightest motion causing exquisite agon}', agony so keenly reacting upon the apprehensive Avife. \" He has fainted ! Your flask, \" whispered the doctor to Eoper at his elbow, Avhen the feat was at length accomplished. Madam shrieked aloud ; she thought the end had come. But the potent spirit did its duty, her husband's hand trembled within hers, and hope revived. There was no dearth of bearers.

Though he was a terror to evil-doers, honest labourers and gentry alike respected the good squire, and Avere equally ready as relays. Joseph Eoper \u2014 on his way home \u2014 lent a willing and steady shoulder, some one leading his sorrel mare. William Hutton, sensitive and sympathetic, would have gone on to West Hall, but the sun was setting and he felt bound to return to Nottingham. For a feAv hesitating minutes he Avatched the sad procession move slowly on under the flickering lights and shadows of the woodland, the watchful wife and doctor on either side the litter. Then, wondering at the more than common interest he felt in the fate of this man who Avas little more than a stranger to him, he rode back home at a rapid pace, for the day Avas far spent, and he feared to make his little wife uneasy by longer delay. As it Avas she met him on the threshold eagerly with, \" I am glad to see thee back, William. Thy Aunt Ann hath been here and reported that a gipsy-woman hath been dragged to gaol for wilfully affrighting a gentleman's horse. I was concerned lest it might be thine.\" \" Nay, nay,\" he answered, after a hearty kiss, \"I am more fortunate. Trotter is a steady beast. I saAV the gentleman thrown. He is"], [17, "TWO ROADS TO GAOL. 7 severely hurt. And strangely enough, Sally, I imagine him to be the one who saved your Uncle Grace from robbery on the Bromsgrove road. At least he bears the same name.\" There Avas eager questioning of the where, and how, that elicited that he and Joseph Eoper had together witnessed the accident and rendered assistance. \" And would you believe,\" he said, turning to his sister, busied in preparations for supper, \" I could have fancied I had old Mr. Webb's dying head upon my knee ? \" Mrs. Perkins, who bad heard Avithout re mark the pitiful tale of Madam West's un controllable grief, now took him up sharply : \" Always fancying likenesses, Will ! It's time you left off that bad habit. What can you remember of a man Avho hath been dead twenty years ? And if all you have told me of Joseph Eoper's tricks be true, the less you see of his company the better.\" It was Catherine, the autocrat, who gave her opinion. \" We leave Nottingham for Aston in the morning. Mr. Eoper lives beyond Southwell. His company is not to be anticipated. The faults of a young man should not be cast up to him after twenty years.\" It Avas William the oracle who replied. Clearly the dictation of Mrs. Perkins was no longer acceptable."], [18, "8 IN HIS OWN HAND. Mrs. Hutton jogged to Aston on her pillion the next day to break the journey. After a night's repose, and a characteristic grave fare well of the farm and Quaker kin, came the return home to her children, and the Avifely duties pressing on her mind. William himself had scarcely recovered the shock of Squire West's accident. All the way home his thoughts alternated between that, Eoper's project for the mill, and his OAvn care for his wife's comfort, the Avife now so inexpressibly dear to him. Over and over again a livid face seemed to rise before him, sometimes as Mr. Webb's, sometimes as the squire's. \" Am I bewitched ? \" he asked himself, as he saw a younger replica of the same pale face on his oavu door-step. \" Catherine is right. I must shake off the bad habit. I see Peter Webb everywhere.\" \" What ails thee lad ? Thou'rt white as a clout,\" he asked of Vill. \" I've had a fright, master,\" he said, after Mrs. Hutton had gone indoors to greet her little ones and Patience in her sober unde monstrative fashion. \" A fright ? \" \"Aye, sir. About one o'clock this morn ing I awoke, hearing a strange creaking and grating noise. Some one was attempting to"], [19, "TWO ROADS TO GAOL. 9 force open our shop door : trying to raise the upper half.\" \" Ah ! And what did vou do ? Call Mr. Thomas ? \" \" No, sir. I heard the fellow cursing the tightness of the bolts, and jumped from the counter, snatching up my pistol in the dark.\" \" Pistol ! Hoav came you by a pistol ? \" \" Jack Cotterwell lent it to me, sir, Avhen I Avent to him about the bolts.\" \" But Dr. DoAvler said you Avould never be able to pull a trigger. What use Avould a pistol be to you ? \" put Mr. Hutton sharply. Vill smiled. \" Not with my right hand, sir, I knoAV, but I learned to do it Avith my left.\" \" Ah, well, Avhat then ? \" His master was growing impatient. \" I ran to the creaking door, and called out 'You ruffian, I'll send a bullet through you if you are not off! ' Then I cried aloud, ' Are you ready, Pat? Now, Mr. Thomas!' and cocked my pistol close to the chink he had made. The villain must haA^e heard, and fancied all three were there armed ready to dart upon him, for I drew back one of the old bolts with a rattle as if to open the door. I heard something drop on the stone Avith a metallic ring, and off the steps Avent the man, and down the Bull Eing as fast as legs could pelt.\""], [20, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 10 \"Well?\" \"I wiped the sweat from my brow, and went into the house, to arouse Mr. Thomas.\" \" You should have done that at first, and not let the rascal escape ! \" \" I had no time to think of that, sir. I Avas afraid the thief might force his way in before Mr. Thomas got here.\" Mr. Hutton smiled. \" Ah, well, perhaps he might.\" His thoughts ran on the slowness of Thomas. Vill's on the distance of the sleeper's chamber in the other house. \" Yet, sir, I do not suppose he could have done,\" Vill added proudly. \" The lock had been forced, but the new bolts had not yielded, though, as you may see, sir, the old wood- Avork is dinted and chipped. Probably he counted on being undisturbed.\" \" Mother-Avit is oft-times better than bravery, my lad. Thine hath served both thee and me. And there Avas no lack of bravery either, though thy face is white as a girl's with the fright. What had the fellow dropped ? \" \" This,\" said Vill, exhibiting a formidable iron lever, more than a foot long. \" Um ! That would have cracked a skull as readily as a door. I marvel the ruffian took to his heels.\" So saying, upstairs went William to talk over the matter to Thomas in"], [21, "TWO ROADS TO GAOL. 1 1 the Avarehouse, Vill first stopping to say, \" Pray, sir, do not say anything to mistress. It is no use to alarm her or the children ; and she might object to my having the pistol.\" Vill's readiness to use the said pistol instead of calling for assistance, and his quick-witted appeal to imaginary helpers, Avere equally discussed with the security of his bolts, and the inconsistence of his apparent fright with his boldness. But neither brother had any insight into the cause beneath the surface. Nothing was known of his dealing Avith the would-be robber beyond Avhat he himself chose to tell. Nothings of his recognition of the man's voice. Nothing of his threat to denounce him, or to set justice on his track if he did not quit the town that very night ; or the scoundrel's counter threat to break in, and if taken accuse the apprentice of con federacy. Nothing of this parley which pre ceded the appeal to the pistol and to other help as if at hand. The young man's fright had far other source than coAvardice. His duty to his master, to his father, and to himself Avere at conflict. He had slept on the hard counter with Jack Cotterwell's pistol by his side for months, prepared to rise and defend his master's pro perty at all hazards."], [22, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 12 But no sooner had the occasion come, and passed, than a clammy sweat had broken on his broAv as the enormity of his act in raising an armed hand against his father, Avhatever he might be, burst upon him. What, if Francis Field had forced his way in and the pistol been fired, might have been the result ? He leaned against the jamb of the splintered door, sick and faint with his own imaginings. He was still trembling when he had groped his way to the remote bedchamber of Mr. Thomas, in the priA-ate house ; and he had not recovered his colour or his composure when that leisurely individual had succeeded in findings the tinderbox and striking a light. \" The lad was white and shivering, Avhether with apprehension or at his own temerity there is no telling,\" explained Thomas. \" If he had not been in such a desperate hurry, and had come for me first, Ave might have caught the robber ! \" \"Thou AA-ouldst never have caught the robber,\" quoth his elder brother dryly. \" Snails catch no mice.\" At which Thomas only laughed and turned to business. The subject was not therefore dropped. It was discussed over Mr. Hutton's counter, over the counters of his friends, was talked about at street corners, and in parlours."], [23, "TWO ROADS TO GAOL. 13 Orders went into Jack CotterAvell for Vill's spring bolts, and Vill had his share of the profits, a result never contemplated by Francis Field. Then about a Aveek after the event a parcel was laid upon the shop-counter by a lad who ran away without a word. It was addressed \" To Mr. Vill, at Mr. Hutton's.\" It contained a handsome silver-mounted pistol, and a card on which was written, \" A Tribute to Fidelity and Bravery.\" There was no clue to the sender, the writing was evidently feigned. Vill was proud of the gift and of the in scription. Both he ascribed to his master, Avho, out of deference to his Avife's opinions, might not care to present such a gift openly. William Hutton was as much in the dark as the recipient. Vill took off the broken door-lock, repaired it, and set about contriving a better one, but no more did he sleep with a loaded pistol by his side. Yet he might have done for all the call there was to use it. Or for the dog procured to guard the deserted warehouse in the night. About a fortnight later, Mr. Hutton Avas told that a man had been taken to the Dungeon for an attempt to rob the Bromsgrove Post boy. He had previously been seen hanging"], [24, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 14 about the Post Office and the Gateway, and was supposed to be the one who had tried to force Mr. Hutton's door. The bookseller would fain have induced Vill to see the robber for identification, if only of his voice. But Vill insisted that as he could not see the man through a door, neither could he 'distinguish his voice so as to swear his life away. He was spared the necessity. The Dungeon was a horrible den in Peck Lane, enclosing behind a pair of spiked gates a courtyard and a building as insecure as it Avas filthy. It was the successor to a still older and filthier dungeon in the rear of Garland House. Before the prisoner could be removed to Warwick for trial he had made his escape. A broken bar at a window and a dangling line of knotted tailor's-list hanging from the spikes above the gates remained to tell how it had been effected. Vj"], [25, "CHAPTEE II. A KEEPSAKE. With the capture and escape of Francis Field, of whose indentity Vill never had a doubt, much of the young man's alarm died away. He argued within himself that Avhen the official description of the long limbed, black browed man was printed in the Hue and. Cry and sent broadcast, he would find Warwick shire too narroAV for safety. And as he breathed more freely, his colour returned, and he took his Sunday afternoon walks abroad once more with firm and elastic step. Now and then Jack Cotterwell, a rough but genuine friend, shared his rambles, or little Miss Catherine Avould trip by his side, or four-year old Thomas beg to be taken by the hand. But there were days when he preferred to be alone, and then, whether by inadvertence or design, he was certain to take his way through New Street, then an irregular medley of shops and private dwellings, containing King Edward's School, the Eost Office, and an inn or two, interspersed with glimpses of garden-"], [26, "16 IN HIS OWN HAND. ground, and set for some length with trees cropped to pattern. And whatever might be the nature of his thoughts he Avas certain to leave New Street behind and seek the um brageous suburbs by way of Easy Hill, where stood the mansion which to him was a casket of rare gems, a living pearl the chief. The hill was not so steep as to take his breath, yet it is true his steps were slower whilst he had Baskerville House in view, and there was an eager Avistful look upon his face that died away when he had left the house and grounds behind. And many a time from the Avild heath beyond, where bricks and mor tar began to intrude on gorse and heather, did he look back on the mansion that had been the first to break the solitude west of New Hall. It was quite a red-letter day for him if by chance he caught the flutter of a Avell knoAvn lady's scarf, or the expanded glories of a hooped skirt between the stately lines of trim evergreens, or the vision of a beauteous face at a Avindow. And, oh ! the ecstacy of that day when Mr. Baskerville, standing at his own gate, invited him into the grounds, and after some kindly chat, finally led him into the fairy palace of a house to be introduced to Mrs. Baskerville as \" The young fellow who had proved himself a match for a daring burglar.\""], [27, "A KEEPSAKE. 17 It Avas not because he Avas particularly proud of such introduction, or because the pleasant lady in the rich damask dress and tall cap saluted him so affably and regaled him with coAA-slip-Avine and cake, or because Mr. Baskerville turned the conversation from the attempted burglary to his spring bolt, the new lock he Avas said to be planning, and his faculty for Avood carving, but because Mr. Baskerville's black-eyed ward sat there and listened with manifest interest, noAV and then throwing in a word. It Avas that cast a golden halo over his reception under that highly favoured roof, the shrine of his adorable divinity. And Avhen he Avould have taken his respectful leave Avith a formal bow had not she put forth her soft white hand to meet his as frankly as Mrs. Baskerville had done ? That Miss Eebecca held herself stiffly aloof concerned him not, so long as Cordelia Carew had placed her Avarm hand in his and said she \"honoured bravery.\" The touch thrilled him through and through. He walked home as if he trod on air. He Avas lost in a mist of rapture and delight. He spent the evening in bewildered reverie ; his dreams Avere glorified. He waked on the morrow to a consciousness of his apprentice ship \u2014 and Avorse, the parentage which made vol. in. 35"], [28, "1 8 IN HIS OWN HAND. the only inseparable barrier betAveen himself and hope. Fortune might be achieved, and beauty might condescend, but to a dishonoured name D * \u2014 never. He went about his morning work, filled with a sweet solace, but painfully conscious that nothing more remained for him. That was in August, about three weeks after the prisoner had made his escape from the old Dungeon. In the afternoon, a Avell dressed man booted and spurred, came into the shop, whilst Vill was selling a slate to a school-boy, and asked for Mr. Hutton ; then cast his eyes around as if taking a mental in ventory, and lounging on the counter with very-much-at-home familiaritA-, stared hard at Vill. \" Here is my master, sir,\" said Vill, as Mr. Hutton, already shoAving a tendency to portli ness, appeared at the inner doorway. \" Hah ! old friend ! There you are as fresh as the morning. Shake hands. You see I have kept my Avord. Have come down to Birmingham to look about me before I pitch my tent,\" cried the stranger. \"Indeed?\" said Mr. Hutton, \"I did not expect you. I imagined you were settled on your own property at Southwell. Is not your old home to your taste ? \""], [29, "A KEEPSAKE. 19 \" My taste ? Damme ! I Avas never born for a country life, sir. There is no turning my sword into a reaping-hook. My elder brother will take farm and mill both off my hands at a fair rental ; and that Avill content both. By-the-bye, coming over Handsworth Heath I gave a look at your shut-up mill. If 'twere mine I should turn it into a corn mill.\" \" Ah, so you said before, and so the mill wrights say.\" \" You would be wise to take their advice. I have only seen the outside. Suppose we ride thither in the morning and go over it. I can then advise you as a practical man. But, damme, don't you mean to invite your old friend into your parlour to see your wife ? I missed my chance in Nottingham.\" Eoper never missed a chance for lack of assurance. It had not been William Hutton's intent to invite him in. He could scarcely give him an open rebuff after the good-will he had shown about the idle mill. He was introduced to Mrs. Hutton, and did his best to make himself agreeable, giving to his natural effrontery an air of bluff-heartiness. She, however, had not forgotten her sister in-law's summing up of Joseph Eoper, and though she hospitably invited him to \" take a dish of tea,\" she scanned him narroAvly in her quiet way. 35\u20142"], [30, "IN HIS OWN HAND. She did not altogether like his answer to a question she put with womanly feeling. \" Bray sir, canst thou tell Iioav the unfor tunate gentleman fareth, who met with the lamentable accident in Sherwood Forest. Doth he still survive ? \" \" Aye, madam he survives, but in hopeless case. Eoor devil, he'll never cross a saddle or folloAv the hounds again. He broke his stiff back sure enough.\" \" Alack ! It Avill be a sad affliction for the poor lady.\" \" Aye, damme, if he lingers long. A rich widow may soon console herself.\" \" In thy opinion, maybe,\" was Mrs. Hutton's grave reply, \" women judge differently of women.\" And so much dignity was there in the little wife's rebuke, that Eoper told him self he had \" put his foot in it.\" \" 1 do not care for thy friend Joseph Eoper,\" said she that night in connubial confidence. \" He savoureth too much of the Avorld. And he hath neither a feeling heart nor an honest eye.\" He contrived to ingratiate himself with William Hutton, nevertheless, and during the few weeks he spent in the town set him all agog to convert the paper-mill into a corn-mill which Avas to grind golden wheat into golden coin. He spoke with all the confidence of a man who had a mill profitably at work."], [31, "A KEEPSAKE. 21 Of course the millwrights who Avould have the job of alteration echoed all he said \u2014 not in the hearing of Mrs. Hutton, or of steady going Mr. Thomas, but in the smoke-room of the \" Swan,\" where, as William waggishly observed, the Avaiters needed to go about with bellows to blow away the smoke so that a man might see the faces of his fellows, and where, indeed, the tin ventilators in the windows were insufficient to dispel the fumes of the long clay pipes in all mouths. Not that Mr. Hutton was himself a smoker, but he could drink a horn of good home-brewed ale for sociability, and Birmingham men did then much of their business over a pipe and a pot of ale in the public smoke-rooms of the town. Eossibly persuasion was easier under such circumstances. In William Hutton's case, he had capital locked up in land and buildings lying idle. To convert the useless into the profitable was desirable. The milhvrights were set to Avork ; and so, in time, was the corn mill. But cheating went on as before, with greater facilities. It proved all loss and no profit. \" I tell thee what, Bill,\" said Thomas to him one day in the following summer ; \" thou art grinding thy guineas, thy books, and thy paper down in thy fine mill instead of grain. Folk come into the shop and the warehouse"], [32, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 22 for goods AA-e have not got to sell.

He avIio is not satisfied with sure gains, courts certain losses. I've been a dupe caught in the lure by knaves. Books and paper raised me up. The mill shall not pull me doAvn. I Avill close it.\" He did close it without delay. He went over his accounts minutely, took stock care fully, and found he had lost in hard cash, time, and crippled business little less than a thou sand pounds. Years before he might have shed tears over his losses. That tearful stage had long been passed. He only braced his energies to repair them. Again he Avas seen Avith his apron on superintending every part of his business. Was always on the spot when wanted. Might be seen setting the stitching frame in order, or the press, Avielding the mallet to beat the book-leaves smooth and close, or the knife to pare and dress the skins for covers, or pasting, mottling, gilding, lettering, and the Avork was never better done. He Avas on the alert alike for shop and warehouse, to take orders or see them executed, to inspirit his assistants by his OAvn example. His shelves refilled and cus tomers came back."], [33, "A KEEPSAKE. 23 His first order had been \" retrenchment.\" His had never been a luxurious household, and he made the request to his good wife with reluctance. \" I am sorry, my dear Sally, to have made this a necessity by my own imprudent haste to grow rich. I've made more haste than good speed. It hurts me to cramp thee in small matters. But thy frugality and excel lent housewifery helped me of old, and I must tax thy care and economy again.\" \" It will be no hardship to save and spare ; to help thee forward noAv thine eyes are opened, and thy own hand is on the plough. God blesseth honest endeavour.\" \" He hath blessed me with a good Avife, Sally. I have never heard a reproach from your lips in all these three years of incon siderate folly. The sting of self-reproach hath been keener.\" \" It is useless to hold a candle to the blind. It is cruel to reproach a man whose OAvn con science smiteth him. Let us rather rejoice that thy affairs have not gone beyond remedy. In parting Avith thy horse, thou hast led the way in retrenchment, and made it light.\" \" Ah, Salty, I've no use for Trotter iioav ; but I had best have sold him many months ago.

My own limbs are stout enough to carry me England over. Sinews and energies stiffen with disuse.\" He had sold his horse at a Ioav figure to get rid of him. Coming into his shop when the bargain Avas concluded, he laid his silver handled knife on the counter before his favourite apprentice. \" Here Vill,\" said he, \" you have Avorked hard over stock-taking, so take that. It was giAren me as a keepsake when I was about your age, and I give it as a keepsake to you. It is good metal, and with care may serve your turn for years. SomehoAv, at times you remind me of the old gentleman from whom I had it.\" Vill had long coveted his master's curious knife, not merely for its three good blades, but for the implement at the end for which he could find many a purpose. His eyes spoke his thanks better than his tongue, and into his breeches pocket it went ready for use. \" Master,\" said he, \" I am more obliged to you for this than for the pistol. It Avill do me better service.

It came from some one with more spirit than common sense. Thy presence of mind and ready wit Avere more commend able than thy bravery, as I told thee, and thy fidelity than either. The nightly watch in the lonely Avarehouse for expected robbers was brave. And I cannot deny that the stand made behind an old rotten wooden door was bold, seeing there was no help Avithin call.

Silver mounted pistols are not commonly presented to 'prentice lads. The giver had more money than Avit, avIio ever he Avas.\" So saying Mr. Hutton went into the house to change his coat and report the sale of Trotter, leaving Vill in a perfect state of beAvilderment. \" Whoever he was,\" transposed itself into \" Whoever was he?\" and the words jostled each other in his brain, leaving him farther and farther from a solution.

Not many days had elapsed since Vill became possessor of Mr. Webb's well-preserved knife, and of a perplexing puzzle over the donor of the pistol at the same time, when he spoke to his master one night after an hour spent in Digbeth at Cotter-well's smithy. \" Sir, do you wish to sell your mill ? \" \" SeU it ? Aye, and glad to get rid of it. 'Tis a monument of my oavii folly and other men's roguery.

If the mill suits he shall have it a bargain.\" And so it came about that the mill in which so many hundreds had been sunk, was sold for eighty pounds as an encumbrance to be got rid of at any price.

The buyer was one Mathew Boulton, a maker of fancy steel goods. He Avas a man of enterprise, and he bought designing there to concentrate all his energies. Hutton, in building his mill, had divided his time and attention, and had well nigh brought disaster on his legitimate business. Boulton, dwelling on the spot, opened out ere long an enchanted vista to a temple of fame and for tune. The one mill had SAvalloAved up coin like a quicksand, the other Avas literally to coin it. Many are the avenues to that same temple of Fortune. William Hutton, Avith his budget of books' and papers, had set a firm foot down in one, and in that self-same town were many journeying thither by divers ways with offer ings more diverse. Even so insignificant an individual as his apprentice Vill was, like a child learning to Avalk, feeling his Avay in the same direction, Avith no notion of any fortune but Avhat he could achieve by his own hand in accordance with the dictum of his master. In forcing Mr. Hutton's lock Francis Field had unwittingly set Vill's active brain to Avork, and he and Jack Cotterwell Avere busy devising a lock that should defy the burglar.

But if Vill did not achieve success all at once, it was certain to come in the end, though he had little or no scientific knowledge, and his first experiments had been in repairing old locks on his master's premises. Wood, Avhalebone, cardboard, Avere the materials out of which he constructed his models, his chief implement being his knife ; his only available time before and after business hours. There is no saying when he did his thinking ; the brain acts un consciously sleeping or Avaking. There is one thing certain, his persistence in mastering such mechanical difficulties as stood in the Avay of his perfect ideal tended to keep him and his friend Jack out of those haunts Avhere vice flourishes and vitality is sapped.

And so matters stood Asdien early in the year 1763 the Nottingham carrier braved the heavy penalties on surreptitious letter-carrying, and the more dreaded danger of floods and snow drifts by the Avay, and handed in a small brown paper parcel which could deceive no body.

He was the custodian of a secret Avhich began to trouble him the more he saw his apprentice Avas not cast in a common mould. For some time he had debated within him self whether it Avas or was not his duty to reveal to the young man all he knew, and call upon Dolly Field to substantiate her own statement. With the latent sluggishness of the Hutton temperament he had debated Avhen he should have acted. \" I have let the family failing overcome me,\" he reasoned, taking himself to task. \" Supine delay hath overslept opportunity.

Had Vill but dropped a hint of Francis Field's appearance, William Hutton would have opened his lips to some purpose. At all events he had not selfishly hid the light of his apprentice under a bushel. His quaintly fluent tongue extolling the young fellow's ingenuity had called general attention to the locks already completed, and raised expectation of something Avonderful in pro gress. It may be he Avas returning through Jack Cotterwell a hundredfold the service rendered to himself more than twenty- years before by the young smith's father, Avhen he was only the bellow-maker's journeyman. If the time had not come for telling Vill that he was supposed to be a stolen child, it had pretty nearly arrived for the completion of Vill's neAV model. Towards the close of that snowy, sleety, slushy February, there Avas a trampling and rumbling in the street. \" Here comes the pattern-card,\" cried Mr. Hutton, with a smile, as the Avell-known pair of long-tailed, cream-coloured horses brought their master's elaborately painted carriage to a stop before the door. \" Vill, go and assist Mr. Baskerville to alight,\" a necessary pre-"], [45, "HAD THE TIME NOT COME? 35 caution, seeing that carriage steps were clumsy and far from the ground.

Mr. Hutton thanked the printer, as if the favour had been done himself, or a son of his own. \" Vill hath reason to be proud of your notice, sir,\" he said. \" And I do not doubt his model will justify your favour.\" So satisfactorily did the model work that Mr. Baskerville, with the lock in his hand, conducted the young felloAV, when he arrived, to a parlour on the other side the spacious hall, where sat Mrs. Baskerville and the tAvo younger ladies at Avork, an open harpsichord telling whence had come the deliciously sweet music which had caught the unaccustomed ear of Vill on entering the house, and filled him with a new sensation as of melody un heard save in his dreams. It had no affinity with the droning psalms of Patience, the hymning of the Meeting House, or the humor ous songs in which his master indulged, or the scraping of the blind fiddler Avho frequented the Bull Eing. It was SAveet as the tinkling of a wayside brook, and had entranced him whilst he waited in the hall \u2014 or was it the ravishing voice that had accompanied the harpsichord ?

Vill stooped to raise it, and perhaps that might account for his heightened colour, as, hat in hand, he acknoAvledged his reception with a silent and deferential boAv, which had, however, not one particle of servility in its bend. It could scarcely account for the fainter reflection of that colour on the cheek of the taller and darker maiden. ':See, dame,\" began the ATelvet- coated japanner to his Avife, \"here is a lock which I fancy Avould trouble the rogues who ran away Avith the tea-caddies and standishes last AATeek.

And hoav, misses, having put our modest young inventor to the blush, I Avill take him round the works whilst you provide for us a dish of tea.\" Surely Vill might esteem himself in high favour. Not only did Mr. Baskerville carry him, Mr. Hutton's apprentice, over his Avorks, and shoAv him the various processes of varnish ing and lacquering, but he showed him the type he had cast with his own hand, the ink he had mixed, the paper he had manufac tured, and pulled a sheet for a sample to show how he Avorked the press, also with his own hand. \" All type had to be brought from Holland until I undertook to design and cast a supe rior style of letter Avith my OAvn hand. .

Ere long Jack CotterAvell had produced work ing specimens of the model lock, the first of which Vill offered to his master, Avith some natural pride, toned down, it might be, by the remembrance who and what had set his Avits to Avork in that direction. It was fastened to the door, and more than one practical locksmith confessed himself baffled in attempts to pick it. Mr. Baskerville, who, as he said, Avas always ready to foster latent genius, not only ordered several duplicate copies to affix to the doors of house and works at Easy Hill \u2014 Iioav- different then from the same spot in this generation \u2014 but suggested that no more samples should be offered to the public until a patent was obtained. MoreoA^er, he volunteered to instruct Vill how to make his application, and, providing the young men had no funds, Avas ready to advance the means. \" The termination of the long war has set"], [51, "A MOSS ROSEBUD. 41 so many ruffians loose to proAvl about and prey upon the public, that the demand is certain to be great.

Each had a small but growing sum safely stowed away. Patents were easy to obtain and cost less under the old laws than the present. But though no elaborate specification Avas required they were all secured with \" red tape,\" and the prelimi nary negotiations made many journe}rs to the gracious and experienced adviser necessary. Vill had never for his own purposes en croached on his master's time. Though he seemed to be striking out a new line for himself, he had stuck steadily to business. This AAras not unnoted, and Mr. Hutton to be no Avhit behind Mr. Baskerville in generosity afforded the young man opportunities for consultation. This was generally in the evening, and being in the summer months when the days are long and bright, he might be seen \u2014 some times bearing a parcel of books from his master \u2014 with the glow of the western sun upon his face, and another glow in heart and"], [52, "42 IN HIS OWN HAND. eyes, Avending his Avay through NeAV Street and its continuation SAvinford Street to the great house wherein his fate seemed to lie. Mr. Baskerville as a rule received him in the library, that room which had first Avaked the creative spirit dormant in the boyish brain. There letters and documents Avere read or draughted, and, his business done, Vill de parted. But not altogether as he came. Some Avay or other, either Avhen he entered or before he left, Miss Carevv Avas almost sure either to descend the noble staircase, or to cross the wide ball. She might only recognize his respectful bow with a graceful if distant courtesy. On one occasion she stopped to ask : \" Do you think you are likely to obtain your patent speedily? \" adding, \" I hope the affair is prospering.\" \" Hoav could it be otherwise than prosper ing, madam,\" said he Avith a beating heart and a low bow, \" Avhen yourself and Mr. Basker ville graciously vouchsafe to be interested.\" \" Certainly, sir, Ave all Avish you success,\" was the reply with an emphasis on the \" all,\" as if to repress any belief that the \" interest \" was special.

This was speedily followed by the fear lest the presumption of his own speech should have given offence, and a little torment in which the minor matter of his desired patent was forgotten. It so happened that another evening late in July he was earlier than usual to arriA'e and to depart. As he closed the library door behind him, the Avestern sun poured a flood of radiance through the richly-tinted staircase window, dyeing the marble pavement Avith an \u00e6therial mosaic of purple, crimson, blue, and amber, and caused him to look up at the lacquered swinging lamps, reburnished by the setting sun and lit Avith mimic flame. At that moment from some unknoAvn door or passage came Miss Carew in a robe of pure Avhite muslin, to be at once transfigured by the radiance. She Avas carrying a small vase of Derby china filled Avith freshly-gathered roses. Did the strong light dazzle her eyes, or did her shapely elbow come in contact with the glorified statue at the staircase foot, and jerk the vase she carried ? There Avas a splash of water, and a shower of crimson petals on the floor, with a floAver or two in their midst."], [54, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 44 Vill sprang forward to gather them up. \"I trust I did not startle you, madam,\" he said, as he picked up tenderly a deep red rose, a variegated York-and-Lancaster, and one or two moss rosebuds. \" Oh, no ! The sun dazzled me \u2014 that was all. I thank you, sir.\" There was an opening Avhite moss rosebud amongst the group. \"Hoav beautiful!\" he exclaimed, singling it out, as he restored them. \" This is the first white moss rose I have seen. I could fancy it an emblem of purity and loveliness.\" As he spoke, in restoring the coveted floAvers their fingers touched, their eyes met. There Avas a look of intense longing in his \u2014 of something indescribable in hers ; a conscious ness that yet rebelled against itself, but there dawned a light on both that came not from the setting sun. \" You can keep the moss rosebud, sir,\" said she, with mingled grace and dignity, as if to cover her momentary confusion. \" We have plenty in the garden \u2014 and my vase was over full.\" If she meant to lessen the favour she failed. Such a flash of delight she had never seen in mortal eyes before, as he cried in a tone of rapture : \" Oh, Miss CareAv !

It Avill ever remind me of the giver.\" \" It will not preserve its fairness many days, sir ; I hope I shall not fade quite so soon,\" she replied lightly, making an attempt to rail}-. \" It will retain its fragrance, and memory will restore the rest.\" Let us charitably accredit the stained glass windoAv with the crimson gloAV on both their faces, as Mr. Baskerville popped his bewigged head out at the library door and asked, \" What is all that chattering about ? \" \" I spilled some of my roses, sir, and Mr. Vill \u2014 Mr. Field has obligingly picktd them up for me.\" \" And you have paid him for his trouble I perceive,' with a glance at the rosebud still in ViU's hand. \" I wish to haAre another word with you, Mr. Vill, I thought you Avere not gone. I had not heard the door.\" The other Avord concerned the patent sought, and was soon said, but there Avere no more words from Miss CareAv. She had fled to her own room ; and there, behind a bolted door, she had thrown herself on the carpet and buried her face in the cushion of a low chair, in a passion of shame and self reproach. \" Goodness !

He had no china vase, no water glass in which to place his fragrant treasure ; only an old green physic bottle captured a year or two before to hold the flowers he endeavoured to imitate in wood. Since then he had been so absorbed in the designing of his lock, no carving had been done. Now he was free, and had a rare stimulus. He had walked home in a sort of glorified dream, unable clearly to realize his own emotions, his own position. He had almost told Miss Carew that the half-blown bud was an emblem of herself, and she had allowed him to retain it. He had felt the thrilling contact of soft warm fingers, had looked into the softened depths of her eloquent black eyes, and read there that which had transfigured and intoxicated him for the hour. Then came the inevitable reaction, the maddening conviction that his father's crimin ality was like the flaming sword before the gate of Eden. It was no new thought, but never before had it pressed upon him so severely. It seemed to burn into his brain, and scorch his brow. What to him would be the value vol. in. 37"], [60, "50 IN HIS OWN HAND. of inventions or patents if the finger of scorn were to be pointed at him as the son of Francis Field ? What encouragement would there be to press onward and persevere, if the proud beauty of Miss Carew held out no wreath for the victor in the race ? He paced the narrow confines of his attic like a caged lion, his shoeless footfalls on the carpetless oak floor all unheard by the sleepers below ; threw himself on his pallet bed, dressed as he was, in chafing desperation. It seemed as if the wine of life was held out to him in the cup of Tantalus. Restless, he rose again and walked about until the moon and stars went out, and a faint shimmering of dawn was visible. He had walked himself into another frame of mind. He stood before his narrow diamond paned window with folded arms, and looked out upon the sky, as he said, \"If I may not win her, I may at least deserve her, and with God's help I will ! I must not pule and whine like a child for the star set so far above me. And Heaven forbid I should trouble the clear fountain of her life with the shadow of my mad passion. If I no longer dread spurning from her feet as a pre sumptuous 'prentice lad, I am too proud to disquiet her dreams with the hapless story of my love and life.

The per fume of her sweet white rose hath filled my room ; may it so fill and sanctify my life to her, as purely, as unobtrusively. And now let me to my task, and be grateful to Mr. Baskerville for calling me away ere I lost my senses altogether.\" So he sat down in the first flush of dawn with Mr. Webb's silver-hasted knife in his hand to fashion a wooden copy of the moss rosebud before him, in the freshness of its beauty, all unaware of the strife in Cordelia's breast, or the new-born suspicions of Mr. Baskerville. \" Ah,\" said the latter to himself, with a tightening of his close lips, \" I must keep a better watch over Cordelia. Flower-giving to Hutton's apprentice ! That will never do. The young man is no doubt clever, and there is scope in Birmingham for such as he to make his way ; but Oliver Carew would turn in his grave if his daughter made a love-match with one so far beneath her \u2014 as the world goes, that is.

If I know aught of the young lady she will rebel, but \u2014 I do not encourage domestic rebellion. She goes.\" And a long drawn pinch of snuff settled the matter."], [63, "CHAPTER V. NOT RUNNING SMOOTHLY. It was settled in Mr. Baskerville's own mind that his ward should be exiled to West Hall without delay, lest she should fall in the way of a handsome young man he had himself introduced to her notice, and with whom she already appeared in some danger of falling in love. A young man of talent, intelligence, and good principles \u2014 but of no fortune and no family. And when a matter was settled in Mr. Baskerville's own mind it was sup posed to be settled de facto. Straightway he wrote to Madame West, inviting her to visit Baskerville House, and promising that his ward Miss Carew should return with her to West Hall to cheer her loneliness, hinting that if she preferred it Miss Carew should pay her visit first. Pending reply he sounded Miss Carew, and asked, \" How would you like to visit your father's Nottinghamshire friends ? \" Expecting a rebuff, he was not a little dis concerted by her ready \" Like it ? Vastly. It would be \u2014 delightful.\" He did not note"], [64, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 54 the break between her words, could not know that \"delightful\" was but a substitute for \" all for the best.\" \" Well, Cordelia, I am disposed to give you a treat if Madame West will come hither for you,\" he said ; but he thought to himself, \"Was the young jade only fooling the lad? I have perhaps been too precipitate.\" No answer came to him for several days. Meantime Vill came again, but the wary guardian (always disposed to be peevish when things did not take the course he expected) detected no signs of a meeting in the hall or in the grounds, and again he concluded he had been precipitate. He was quite sure so, when Madame West's reply proved a courteous negative. \" It would give me pleasure to receive your charming ward and make her visit to Notting hamshire agreeable,\" she wrote, \" but I am engaged in legal controversy with the heir-at law, who has taken possession of Westhorpe, and laid claim to West Hall, my own in heritance ; and I should be no companion in my childless desolation for a high-spirited girl like Miss Carew.

Another year may find me more composed, and less the slave of untoward circumstances. Meanwhile com mend me to the ladies and offer what apology you can to Miss Carew.\" At another time the troubles of the child less widow would have called forth the warmest sympathy of the childless man ; then he felt little but the disarrangement of the plan so comfortably settled in his own mind. \" Bah ! \" he exclaimed peevishly, \" there's no dependence on a woman. Better be child less, than have the charge of two girls with their love-making and frippery. Rebecca must needs set her mind on Thomas Westley, regardless of my views, and now Cordelia shows a disposition to thwart me.

There is no leaving home for me until my great unique Bible is ready for the subscribers, or I might take wife and girls to Leamington Spa, or to Wolverley, out of the way.

Old Peachum was right ! Well, Miss Cordelia, yours is fortunately a long minority, you either marry to please me or not at all, whilst I hold the reins.\" Carew Mount had been leased to a stranger for the long minority of the heiress, four years of which had yet to expire, so there was no sending the young lady thither out of the way of a possible admirer. He had wasted a good many pinches of snuff during his vexatious cogitations, and the men in his employ discovered that \" some thing had put master out.\" Ere long, how ever, he gave a dry little cynical chuckle over his own politic arrangement to receive Vill in future in the counting-house, and the likelihood that the immediate grant of a patent would do away with his visits altogether. \" To withdraw my patronage now would show animus, and damage me as much as the young man. Open opposition would fan a spark to a flame. 'Tis well to appear blind. Now Hutton has disposed of his circulating library there will be few opportunities to ex change glances along with books ; and the new library in Colmore Row will not cause the ladies to stray through the Gateway.\" And so having satisfied himself he pro ceeded to work off a proof-sheet, and correct"], [67, "NOT RUNNING SMOOTHLY. 57 the press, with the same cynical smile upon his lips. Cordelia's disappointment when Madame West's letter was made known, not only dis concerted him, but threw him completely off his guard. \" There's no knowing the ways of women,\" he said to himself, \" I'd have sworn that rose bud was a love token. Yet here is she upset because she is to remain in Birmingham with chances of meeting the fellow, instead of moping with a disconsolate widow in a remote country house ! Could it be the stained win dow crimsoned both their faces, and I have been making an ass of myself ? \" What should he know of the war between love and pride, or the urgent desire to flee from temptation ? As little could Mrs. Baskerville discern the source of Cordelia's restlessness in the weeks to come ; the sudden fits of energetic industry when no work came amiss, the hasty flinging aside of sewing, or knotting, or netting, for a dash at the harpsichord that threatened the destruction of the keys, and subsided into music so low and melancholy the good old lady felt herself saddened in listening, or the outdoor reading, or rather the restless pacing of the garden walks with a book, which might have been upside down for all she knew of it."], [68, "58 IN HIS OWN HAND. Rebecca was too much engaged with her own lover to observe much of this. One thing she did note, that Mr. Vill came no more ; and beyond a brief remark that Hutton's apprentice had obtained his patent, her uncle ceased to speak of him or of his lock. Cordelia had noticed this reticence, be sure, and surmising the reason, she rebelled in secret against the negative rebuke. It was not the best way to subdue her own heart. She found herself watching the gates and the open country beyond from the window of her own room, where she spent many solitary but not profitable hours. Once or twice she caught a glimpse of Vill's tall figure passing the ornamental iron gates on a Sunday, and once with a shorter and stouter companion crossing the heath towards New Hall almost knee-deep in gorse and heather. And as from time to time he looked back over his shoulder she wondered if he was looking out for her, or if he had seen where she stood watching him, and what he would think if he had. It was customary at that time for ladies to do their own marketing, and Mrs. Baskerville might be seen every Thursday, accompanied by one or other of the girls, and followed by a servant man who carried a couple of hus^e"], [69, "NOT RUNNING SMOOTHLY. 59 open baskets, wending her way towards the shambles in the Bull Ring, to the butter women under the Old Cross, or to the solitary fishmonger's, for supplies of such comestibles as their own gardens and poultry-yard did not supply. As a rule she avoided the crowded Gateway on a market day, having as little liking to be jostled bj7 the panniers of a pack-horse, upset by a refractory porker, or to brush skirts with a coach or cart wheel, as she had to traverse the narrow raised cause way of the High Town, where the horns of beasts standing for sale in serried rank in the roadway below, threatened damage to flounces or furbelows. There was a narrow crooked alley running from New Street to the Bull Ring, at the extreme end of the Gateway block of pre mises. It was not over savoury, but it served Mrs. Baskerville to escape what she regarded as the greater evil. Consequently she did not usually pass the shop of Mr. Hutton, and with the closing of his circulating library the necessity to call there in a manner ceased. The magazines had to be fetched once a month as of old, or it might be a message had to be delivered. On the first of these occasions \u2014 closely following the rosebud incident \u2014 Miss Carew had \" a headache,\" and held herself excused."], [70, "60 IN HIS OWN HAND She regretted her decision almost before Mrs. Baskerville and Rebecca were out of sight, and not all the pride she summoned to con firm her resolution sufficed to overcome her longing to be with them, \" if only to show there was nothing more than friendliness in her simple gift.\" Mrs. Baskerville and Rebecca duly returned, and laid the magazines upon the table, too much overpowered with the heat of the sun \u2014 it was before the advent of parasols \u2014 to note the eager expectancy of Cordelia under cover of assumed indifference. \" Where did you go ? Whom did you see ? \" elicited only from the elder, \" Oh, no one in particular,\" from the younger ; \" no one but Mr. Westley, who is coming here this evening.\" But at the dinner table Mrs. Baskerville remarked, \" I think Mr. Hutton must be getting on in the world. He hath taken his wife and children to Aston in a chaise ; and they are not the people to launch out beyond their means. I think it would do that apprentice of his no harm to have a holiday.\" \" Very likely,\" replied her husband ; \" all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\" \" Well, whether he works too much or thinks too much, he seems to be galloping to his grave. His eyes are sinking into his head.\""], [71, "NOT RUNNING SMOOTHLY. 61 Miss Carew was raising peas on the point of her knife, back they fell on the plate with a rattle, and only with an effort did she keep the knife from falling too. Mrs. Baskerville went on, unobservant of the frown on her husband's brow. \" He said he could not sleep in Mr. Hutton's absence.\" \" No doubt ! No doubt ! And so you met Westley. What had he to say ? \" Mr. Baskerville's question turned the current of conversation, and left Miss Carew to dis tract herself with fears and fancies, all her family pride humbled in the dust. She would have been glad of any pretext to call at the bookseller's, but none presented itself. She was ready at any time to go shopping with Rebecca to mercer's or hosier's or shoemaker's, to exchange books at the library in Colmore Row on the bare chance of meeting Vill and ascertaining for herself if he were really as ill as was said. Coming back disappointed, she would fling her bonnet on her bed exasperated with herself for thus troubling herself about a mere bookseller's apprentice. September came. Miss Marston was stitching early and late for the wedding in prospective. Miss Carew accompanied Mrs. Baskerville to the Market and to the bookseller's."], [72, "62 IN HIS OWN HAND. The magazines were ready, but there was only an assistant behind the counter. \" Where is Mr. Vill ? \" asked the old lady. \" In the warehouse, madam, helping master to take stock. Shall I call him ? \" \" Oh, dear no. I hope he is better.\" The man opened his eyes. \" He has not been ill, madam.\" \"Then his looks belied him,\" said Mrs. Baskerville and marched out. Cordelia had not spoken a word. October showed his russet face. Again Miss Carew accompanied Mrs. Baskerville. Behind the counter stood the assistant and eight-year old Catherine. The magazines were not placed in readiness. The assistant, new to the department, ex plained that Mr. Vill had been ill in bed for a fortnight, and he did not know which they were. \"111!\" exclaimed both ladies in a breath, Cordelia with a gasp in hers. \" Ah,\" con tinued the elder, \" I was wiser than you, young man. I saw it coming. What ails him?\" \" A low fever, madam,\" answered the assistant, wondering at Mrs. Baskerville's interest in his master's apprentice.

How did you know ? \" \" I expected it long ago,\" said Cordelia in a sort of muffled voice. \"Are you sorry he is ill?\" queried the little damsel, gravely. \" Aye, my dear,'' answered the kindly old lady. \" Very,\" was the low but impressive response of the young one, as the child went on with a sober earnestness, \" / am, for I love him, oh, so much, and I do so miss him.

The hope had its echoes, and the ladies departed with their magazines, much to the satisfaction of the servant waiting outside with the loaded baskets. Cordelia carried a heavier load away with her.

It's hardly safe to drive one's carriage through them. And at night when there's no moon it is abso lutely impracticable.

The subject of much needed improvement was mooted and talked over, Dr. Ash (who also suggested the need of a hospital for the sick) and one or two others holding with Mr.Basker ville; William Hutton, who did not care to have a slur cast on the situation of his own premises, pooh-poohing the idea of improvement. \" Nothing ails the atmosphere,\" said he, \" the house is healthy enough. More likely,\" and he quoted Shakespeare, \" the poor youth's in love.\" There was a little laughter, the idea of improvement was shelved for a time, and Mr. Baskerville was reminded of his old suspicions Vill had very nearly been shelved along with the new project, for a week or two more went by before he was able to take his old and active part in the business. He was, how ever, well cared for, not alone because he was a valuable servant and a favourite, but because kindliness was the law of the house hold, and Patience in particular had a strong motherly feeling towards him. There were fragments of fact in all the sup positions respecting the primary cause of Vill's illness. Dr. Ash came nearest to the mark. vol. in. 38"], [76, "66 IN HIS OWN HAND. Vill was in love, hopelessly in love. He had laboured early and late to perfect his lock, and also to reproduce the white moss rosebud in a form worthy of presentation to Miss Carew, but he had seen nothing of her since the sweet bud passed into his possession. He detected Mr. Baskerville's suspicions in the intimation that he would in future find his patron in the counting-house, and when he saw nothing week after week of the young lady, he had a conviction that his origin had been set before her in all its shameful details. He had told himself that his love was hopeless, but there was a yearning after hope neverthe less. The success of his patent lock became as nothing to him whilst feeling himself dis graced in the sight of the one he worshipped so devotedly. He was under the conviction that she scorned him, and his very integrity made the sense of a dishonoured name sting him more keenly. Over-work and unhappiness thus predisposed him to be influenced by any miasma floating in the atmosphere. And no doubt he owed his recovery as much to Miss Catherine's report that \" pretty Miss Carew was very sorry he was ill and hoped he would soon be better,\" as to Dr. Ash's pills and potions. The latter administered to the body's malady, she to the \" mind diseased.\""], [77, "CHAPTER VI. TURNING THE TABLES. November skies were not propitious to feminine attire, but very few ladies went to market in their best array, and Mrs. Baskerville was too good a housekeeper to do her catering by deputy. Of course, she preferred a fine day for her marketing, but though she had never so much as seen an umbrella she did not shirk her duty. She simply dressed for the weather and expected her companions to do the same. With an oilskin hood and cape toiprotect her bonnet and dark camlet gown, worn well tucked up, and a pair of iron-ringed pattens on her feet to raise her out of the mud, she would trudge on through the rain composedly, and naturally expect her attendants to do likewise. Not that she or they were regard less of the discomfort, but it was one of the necessary adjuncts of the season and had to be borne. Only long practice could have enabled the patten wearers to pilot their way through the 38\u20142"], [78, "68 IN HIS OWN HAND. deep mud of the suburban road, flooded in rainy seasons with the over-flow of a shallow stream ; and still greater skill was needed to tread safely the narrow causeways of the streets \u2014 roughly paved as they were with small boulder-stones known in recent years as \" pet rified kidneys \" \u2014 since pattens, as the writer can testify, had an uncomfortable tendency to twist under the feet to the danger alike of ankles and equilibrium. Yet it was only when the downpour was excessive and the roads were well-nigh impas sable, that the good lady called her husband's grand carriage into requisition, since although theirs was quite a country residence, it was little more than half a mile from the Bull Ring, and the growing town was rapidly approaching Easy Hill. Seeing this was the case there was nothing unusual in the offer of Miss Carew to attend Mrs. Baskerville on the day when the maga zines were due, whilst Rebecca took charge of affairs indoors. There was little loitering in the open Market Place. Purchases were soon made, and the laden servant dispatched homeward in advance, whilst a call was made for the magazines, Mrs. Baskerville, if the truth were told, being herself desirous to see how the clever and fine young man had borne his"], [79, "TURNING THE TABLES. 69 severe attack. Pale he had been and thin to attract her attention in the first instance ; paler and thinner he had risen from his bed, and there had not been much time to recruit. There was no one in the outer shop but himself at the moment they entered, and his back was towards them. The click of pattens caused him to turn sharply. A sudden flush rose to his temples as they greeted him, but it soon faded. \" Gracious me ! you look like a ghost ! \" exclaimed Mrs. Baskerville, unable to repress her astonishment. \" I am sorry to see ,\" began Miss Carew, then involuntarily put her mittened hand out over the counter, and before Mrs. Basker ville had recovered her surprise the soft white fingers lay in his trembling clasp ; her moist black eyes met his full of pity and sad ness. In another moment she had recovered her hand and her self-possession, but the involun tary action, the broken speech, the eloquent eyes, had told him all he cared to know. She did not scorn or despise him ! \u2014 The knowledge had been cheaply bought by his long suffer ing. \" I had very nearly become a ghost, madam,\" he answered cheerfully, \" and I cared not to live. But an angelic message"], [80, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 70 came to me a month ago as I lay on my pallet, and bade me rise\u2014 and now \u2014 I feel the fresh current of life strong within me. Strength and colour will soon return.\" He had addressed himself to Mrs. Basker ville, but Cordelia felt the interpretation was for her without his addendum, made after a pause. \" I have to thank you, ladies, both, for the honour of some kind inquiries during my ill ness. Believe me, I shall ever remember your condescension with gratitude.\" \" We are glad to find you are able to thank us, and behind the counter again, and so will be Mr. Hutton,\" observed Mrs. Baskerville. \" Aye,\" remarked Mr. Hutton, coming out of the back shop, \" we thought he would have slipped through our fingers a month ago. Then he took an unexpected turn for the bet ter \u2014 and here he is \u2014 worth half-a-dozen dead men.

To have done less would have been downright ingratitude.\" A blustering individual, greeted as Mr. Roper, entering at that juncture called Mr. Hutton away. Vill had spoken with earnestness. The warm blood had mounted to his broad fore head, and tingled in his finger-tips. Never had his master's praise been so sweet or so opportune. He was sure no word was lost on Miss Carew although she had listened only. With a proud uplifting of her head she broke the silence : \" Such approbation from such a master is a patent of nobility ! \" Then as if conscious she had said too much, she caught at one suggestive word, and turned the conversation into common-place, \" Pray, sir, is your patent lock in good demand ? \" \" Thank you, Miss Carew, it is. So many vagabonds have been let loose from disbanded regiments, and robberies have been so fre quent all over the kingdom, that it is impos sible to supply them fast enough.\" \" I am pleased to hear it.

It is no use waiting any longer, the rain doth not abate.\" \" Here are the magazines, madam ; I had better tie them up to keep them dry,\" said Vill, briskly papering them up. To cut the string he drew ifrorn his pocket the silver hasted knife, then laid it on the counter. Miss Carew took it up. \" Dear me, that is a singular knife, and it appears to be an old one. Do you know what these letters stand for ? \" \" Yes, madam, W. H. for William Hutton, who gave the knife to me, and P. W. for Peter Webb, from whom my master received it many years ago.\" \" It is quite a curios \" At that moment in came Mr. Baskerville, not in his best mood. Occupied with the knife and with each other, the stoppage of the carriage had been unheard among the noises of the market, where cattle and vehicles were not unexpected. \" Ah ! \" cried he, \" I thought I should find you here ! \" and he shut his lips tightly down or he might have said something sharp. \" Why, John ! whatever brought you here through the rain ? \" \" Oh, Guardy, who could have expected"], [83, "TURNING THE TABLES. 73 you ? \" questioned wife and ward simultan eously as the knife was dropped and the magazines taken up. \" The carriage brought me, young lady, though I was not expected, and it will take you back. So hurry in, and don't keep the horses steaming in the rain.\" Vill was round the counter in an instant, intending to assist the ladies, but Mr. Basker ville waved him back, saying coldly, whilst there was a shuffling off of pattens, \" Keep back, sir. Your services are not required. I am here. My servant waits. You might find the rain prejudicial to your health. Prithee, tell your master I will see him ere the week be out.\" Mr. Baskerville's manner was more repel ling than his words. Vill stopped short. The repulse was pointed, and he chafed under it, as the sensitive nostrils indicated. So chafed Miss Carew. She held her pattens in one hand by the buckled straps, and had gathered up her gown with the other before descending the muddy steps. To do this the parcel had been put down on the counter. At once she dropped the folds of her dress, and drawn to her full height, for the second time that morning put forth her hand to meet the palm of Vill."], [84, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 74 \"Pardon me, sir,\" she said, with marked politeness. \"I had forgotten your recent illness. I should be sorry to expose you to a renewal. Good-day, sir.\" The proffered hand was taken, clasped, released. She again gathered up her skirts, and in quite another tone said, \" Pray, Guardy, bring the magazines, since Mr. Vill must not attend us in the rain.\" Mr. Baskerville looked black. \" Here, Pat,\" cried Vill to the lad, \" carry this parcel and the ladies' pattens to the carriage.\" And so he bowed them out, all in a thrill with the touch of that small soft hand ; all admiration of her palpable protest against Mr. Basker ville's rudeness, and perplexed by the sudden change in his patron's manner. No sooner had the carriage turned the corner, and emerged from the darksome gate way into the light of New Street than Mr. Baskerville began, \" Do you think, Miss Carew, it befits your father's daughter to exchange courtesies and clasp hands with a mere parish apprentice, as if he were your equal ? \" \" When Mr. Baskerville introduces ' a modest young inventor ' to his wife, his niece, his ward, at his own table, the ladies may surely be excused if they treat as an equal the person so received as an equal.\""], [85, "TURNING THE TABLES. 75 Mr. Baskerville's painted snuff-box was in demand. Mrs. Baskerville sat silent. \" There is a wide difference between patron age and familiarity, Miss Carew.\" \" Assuredly, as wide as between courtesy and familiarity. It was my father's teaching, that neither gentleman nor gentlewoman could allow an inferior to exceed in politeness.\" There was another and more prolonged raid on the snuff-box. A lurch of the carriage into a rut shook out a portion of the contents over the velvet breeches, and furnished an excuse for an expletive more strong than polite. \" Demme, miss, am I to be schooled in politeness by my own ward ? Was whisper ing over a counter or hand-shaking needed for courtesy? \" \" No, sir, I offered my hand to cover your discourtesy,\" she said haughtily; \" my father's daughter requires no schooling in propriety.

I respect and admire Mr. Vill, sir, but I shall not forget what is due to my father's memory, or to myself.

And the black eyes were full of fire. Further conversation was cut short. The carriage had stopped at the foot of the double steps, and the footman held open the door. Had Mr. Baskerville desired to elevate Vill into a hero, and excite the admiration he was desirous to prevent, he could not have done so more effectually. Cordelia Carew was of a nature to rise up in defence of the absent, and to oppose oppo sition. She had turned Mr. Baskerville's weapons against himself, and even her last shot he took as a bullet aimed against his own breast. In finding arguments to defend her own conduct she had been roused to estimate and defend the absent Vill, and had there been no prepossession in his favour already, it might have been created."], [87, "TURNING THE TABLES. 77 She certainly contrasted him with Mr. Marston, much to the disadvantage of the latter, who found her cold, distant, impene trable, haughty. There was no more market-going with Mrs. Baskerville ; the distinguished printer took care of that. The carriage was at the good lady's disposal every Thursday, but either Miss Rebecca or himself went as her companion, market-baskets filling up the vacant space. Mr. Baskerville himself laid down the law that \" before Rebecca could be fit to marry, she must learn to market.\" \"And what about myself?\" asked Cordelia. \"The same necessity does not exist for Miss Carew of Carew Mount,\" was the answer. Indeed so frequently was she reminded of her position and inheritance that at last she was tempted to exclaim, \" A fig for Carew Mount, if it is to keep me a prisoner here all the winter ! \" She really was little better than a prisoner, for although there were balls and parties about Christmas time to which they were invited, there was but a step from house to carriage.

The signor came and went in a sedan chair,"], [88, "78 IN HIS OWN HAND. and the minuets were practised in' the draw ing-room. Mr. Baskerville was no doubt straining his prerogative, but he had some show of reason. If the previous winter had been bad, the present was far worse. Floods, and frost, and snow, and floods again, made roads in town and country almost impassable. Carriers advertised their inability to convey heavy loads, or to perform their journeys at all. Mails were delayed or went astray, post-bo3Ts were lost in drifts, or leaving their beasts to perish, made their way on foot with the bags ; in one case the bags were found hung on a post, the two men in charge lying dead in the snow. It was not a winter for ladies to go abroad on foot where there was water to be forded, and Mr. Baskerville was chary of his cream coloured horses. At all events they were not for Miss Carew's use that winter. She rebelled openly, and insisted on having a horse of her own to ride. But the guardian was the keeper of the purse, aud no horse was bought. Heavy floods followed the last snow, and there were complaints of disaster all over the country. But no sooner had the water subsided, and the daffodils donned their yellow petticoats,"], [89, "TURNING THE TABLES. 79 than Mr. Baskerville announced an invitation for Miss Carew from Madam West. This time there was no eagerness displayed, the young lady demurred on the plea that her wardrobe required renewing, and Mrs. Bas kerville innocently enough concurred. i\"Bah!\" said her husband peevishly. \" Madam West has no sons to be captivated with ' purple and fine linen.' But there,\" and he handed his wife a bank-note, \" take Cordelia to a mercer's and buy all she re quires, and be quick about it. And, Sarah, see she goes nowhere else.\" Satins, taffeta, chintz, brocade, lawn, lace, were inspected and selected ; there was a visit to the shoemaker's, to Allen's for a straw hat and haberdashery, and there the young lady, to her chaperon's great surprise, made a pur chase of a fair-haired English doll with blue glass eyes and very rosy cheeks. She desired that it might be wrapped up separately. \" And now,\" said she, \" as I shall not have time to dress it, I shall take it with me to little Catherine Hutton ; I require some sta tionery.\" It was in vain Mrs. Baskerville expostulated. Miss Carew had a determined will of her own. \" I am Mr. Baskerville's ward, madam, not his prisoner, though I have been something like it during the winter. But I have deter-"], [90, "80 IN HIS OWN HAND. mined, if there be any more coercion, to appeal to the Lord Chancellor to shorten my minority.\" So saying, she walked out of the shop, leaving Mrs. Baskerville to follow, or not, as she thought proper."], [91, "CHAPTER VII. presented. If Miss Carew had expected to see Mr. Vill (so he styled himself in his dislike to his sup posed patronymic) she must have been dis appointed, for only Mrs. Hutton stood behind the counter. Mrs. Baskerville, pleased to see her, shook hands with an expression of her pleasure and surprise, to which Mrs. Hutton replied, \",No, I am not often here now. But thee sees, Tuesday is always a slack day, so William gave Vill liberty to go with Jack Cotterwell about a workshop the two think of taking in Edgbaston Street. Thee sees the little smithy in Digbeth is too small for the old man and his son both, now there is such a demand for the improved locks and bolts, and as Vill will be out of his time this summer the two are for going fairly into partnership. William saith they are certain to succeed if their small capital sufficeth. Indeed he hath offered to advance a small sum to fit up the new premises for the steady and thrifty young men.'' vol. hi. 3 J"], [92, "82 IN HIS OWN HAND. \" Very generous of Mr. Hutton,\" said Mrs. Baskerville. \" Nay, he seeth his money will be safe, and Vill hath been a truly faithful servant unto us. We could not honestly let him go emptyhanded, seeing that he hath saved us so much.\" \" Your sentiments do you honour, madam. I do not doubt Mr. Vill will prove himself worthy your esteem,\" observed Miss Carew ; then went on to say, \" I require a small matter of stationery, letter-paper, sealing wax, quills, and ink ; sufficient to serve me during several weeks' stay in the country.\" Before these could be looked out she laid her long narrow parcel on the table, and said, \" I have brought a doll for Miss Catherine, and some blue silk for the doll's frock. You will please to tell your good little girl I meant to bring her one as a Christmas-box, but \u2014 but \u2014 I was not at liberty to leave the house to obtain it.\" Just then in came Miss Catherine and her brother Tom with book bag and slates, fresh from school. The flaxen-haired doll was handed to her with a repetition of the message previously left with the mother, only this time was added with a smile, \"and you understand, Miss Kitty, big girls must do as their elders bid them just as little girls must.\""], [93, "PRESENTED. 83 The quick-witted child listened with demure politeness, taking in every word (as most likely Miss Carew intended) before opening the parcel to admire and hug the wooden baby. \" You will kiss me for it ? \" \" Oh, yes, and thank you,\" and the little girl, whose mother very rarely kissed her children, put her arms shyly round Cordelia's neck to be herself kissed very warmly. \" Come, come, Cordelia, we shall be late for tea,\" cried Mrs. Baskerville. \" See, you have dropped one of the parcels from your muff.\" Straightway Mrs. Hutton, whose quiet thanks had been already spoken, volunteered to send the young lady's sundry parcels home for her, along with the rather ungainly package of stationery. \"It is not necessary,\" was on the tip of Cordelia's tongue, when some inner prompting caused her to substitute an acceptance of the offer. Then the two ladies, whose hoops somewhat crowded the confined space, made the best of their way home. The mercery goods followed them that evening ; the numerous etceteras, stationery included, all under one cover, did not arrive until the morrow. The parcel was addressed to \" Miss Carew,\" and the servant to whom it 39\u20142"], [94, "84 IN HIS OWN HAND. was delivered carried it straightway to the young lady in her own room. It appeared more bulky than she had anti cipated, but she did not open it immediately. When she did she discovered one neatly papered oblong package, of which she had no remembrance. It was not the stationery, and was separately addressed to her, in the same handwriting as the superscription on the outer wrap. What could it be? It was scarcely heavy enough for a volume of the size, yet it had square corners like a book, and something else seemed laid upon it. She turned it over and over in perplexity for some moments before she broke the seals. Then she stood mute with astonishment as she uncovered a dainty trinket-box of white holly, with a delicately carved moss rosebud lying on the top as if dropped by the artist hand upon it. What a revelation it was to her. How the hot blood of passionate shame surged upwards to her brow, and then receding left her whiter than the rose-bud ! Was it for her the hours of sleep had been given to produce such loveliness? There was no need to tell her whence it came. She was still gazing on the unopened box when Rebecca's step and voice were heard."], [95, "PRESENTED. 85 The precious treasure was hastily thrust out of sight, and when Miss Marston entered to announce the mantua-maker's arrival, Cordelia Carew was busied with the numerous articles scattered over her counterpane. At least a couple of hours had been spent with the mantua-maker in measurements and instructions before Cordelia was free to return to her room. Examination revealed to her a small silver key wrapped in thin paper, and lying perdue under one of the raised leaves. It was not the velvet lining of the box that caught her eye, but a neatly-folded well sealed letter. Goodness ! how the hands of the proud beauty shook and trembled, and how her colour went and came as she opened the paper and read, \"Madam, \" Pray pardon my presumption in thus addressing you. \" It was my good fortune on a sunnj^ day that will ever live in my memory to become the possessor, by your favour, of a fair white rosebud, which seemed to me a sweet type of the incomparable gatherer. \" You were pleased to suggest that the lovely flower would fade. On that inspiriting I endeavoured to catch the fleeting outlines of the opening bud in material less perishable,"], [96, "86 IN HIS OWN HASD. so as to preserve a lasting memorial, which I was so hardy as to hope might find acceptance from the gracious giver of the original. \" That original I shall preserve whilst I have life, for although its beauty hath fled, its fragrance remains and seems to breathe of other inestimable virtues equally imperishable. For a time I drew from its perfume a breath of hope, for I had rashly dared to lift my aspirations very high, but as the petals faded one by one, so died my hopes, chilled by reflection. And now I cherish only a dead flower \u2014 and a sweet memory. I know, madam, it is not for the humble apprentice to avow his mad passion to one so far above him as Miss Carew. But since I fear that Mr. Baskerville hath penetrated mjr secret, and desires to check my presumption by removing the treasure he guards to a safer distance (as a little bird hath whispered to me), I am driven to assure him, and yourself, madam, that no impertinent intrusion on your peace or privacy need be feared from me. Were I other than I am no guardian should deter me from placing my fate in your gracious hands, but being what I am, conscious of the insur mountable barrier of my birth, I shrink from even the suspicion of annoyance or importunity. \" Yet, madam, I have ventured to send my humble handiwork with this. If vou dei<m to"], [97, "PRESENTED. 87 accept the tribute, you will at least remove my dread lest I should by word or look have incurred your own displeasure. That indeed would be a grievous trouble to \" Your devoted slave until death, \" Vill.\" Could Mr. Baskerville have seen the eager ness with which this billet was devoured, the tears and kisses showered upon the senseless paper, what would he have said or done ? He saw only a voiceless elation in his ward's bearing, a warmer glow on her cheeks, a brighter sparkle in her eyes, and set all down to a woman's pleasure in shopping and con templating silks and satins for her own adorn ment. He had taken care to assure himself no Mr. Vill had been seen. Where was Miss Carew's pride ? Over and over again she asked herself that question when the first excitement of Vill's singular avowal and renunciation had subsided. She could not answer her own query. She could only tell herself that she was loved, and that whatever Vill's birth, no man more worthy a true woman's love had crossed her path before. Accept his gift, aye, and treasure it. She knew then why her parcels had not come the previous evening. She could see' how that letter had been penned in the midnight when others slept, just as the carved rosebud had"], [98, "88 IN HIS OWN HAND. been shaped, and both alike for her. She owed something to her ancestors, but more unto herself. She had only to wait to see the writer of that noble letter rise out of his apprenticeship into a higher sphere. No hand or word of hers should daunt him at the outset. But the letter called for an answer if she meant to retain his offering, and how should she answer so as neither to seem over bold or over-proud ? She took the night to deliberate, but morning found her still perplexed, still undecided. She was equally afraid to wound his feelings, or to encourage him too openly. More than one attempt h?d been set aside before she could pen with a firm hand the following : \"Baskerville House. \" Sir, \u2014 I am at a loss how to thank you adequately for the honour you have done my poor flower and me. Whilst I am away in Nottinghamshire, with my father's friend at West Hall, the fadeless copy will serve to remind me of one whose genius is only equalled by his modesty and delicacy. \" Mrs. Hutton spoke of your new enterprise. That it may lead to success and prosperity is the desire of \" Your well-wisher, \" Cordelia Carew. \"To Mr.Vill,atMr.Hutton's,in the Gateway.\""], [99, "PRESENTED. 89 To Ph\u0153be, her own maid, a simple-minded faithful creature who had come with her from Carew Mount, this letter was intrusted for committal to the post office. The maid her self was no scholar and could not read. \" I hate secrecy,\" was Cordelia's excuse to herself, \" but it is needless to provoke my guardian to greater antagonism, or he might do Mr. Vill and his partner some disfavour.\" Miss Carew was busied with preparations for her journey, plying an industrious needle, and thinking all the while of her letter and of Vill's aspect when it was delivered to him, but she never for a moment reflected what a reve lation it might be. Vill's patent had brought him letters through the post ; one more attracted no attention. He was serving a customer when it was delivered, so without examination it went into his pocket to be read at leisure. \" Goodness ! \" How the superscription seemed to fascinate his sight as he gazed upon it when the leisure came, and fancied he recognized the writing. He tore the letter open, and read with varying emo tions, gladness uppermost. But not until business was over for the day had he a chance to retire to his own room and extract all the sweetness it held for him. Then he unlocked his own box and drew"], [100, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 90 thence the safely guarded pistol in its original paper cover. He held the two superscriptions together. There could be no two opinions. They were written by the same hand. The disguise of the former was so slight as to be transparent. His heart gave a great bound at the dis covery ; but not for a second moment did he forget that the son of Francis Field was not at liberty to take advantage of his know ledge. Whatever fortune might do for him in the future, however generous Miss Carew might be, he could not be the scoundrel to sully her purity with an alliance to his dis graced name. The pain of this conviction was not the less maddening because he kept the agony shut up in his own breast. Mr. Baskerville hesitated whether to risk his horses and carriage on a long rough journey, or to hire a chaise. Finally, his love of display prevailed ; and about ten days later the gorgeous pictorial carriage, with post-horses and postillion from the \"Swan,\" stood in front of Baskerville House, with his own liveried coachman on the box seat. Miss Carew was handed in with formal politeness, Ph\u0153be scrambled in, and after seeing the luggage safely strapped behind, Mr. Baskerville followed. The footman pushed back the sliding step"], [101, "PRESENTED. 91 under the vehicle, the post-boy smacked his whip, and they were off, Mrs. Baskerville, Rebecca, and Mr. Marston waving their handkerchiefs from the broad flat uppermost step so long as a 'kerchief could be seen waving in return from the chaise window. As the carriage passed under the flat-roofed Gateway, and the pair of horses made a sharp turn northward into the High Town for Bull Street, Mr. Baskerville's brow contracted, and his lips tightened. There stood Mr. Vill on the high and narrow causeway with a letter in his hand, with which he made a sign for the postillions to draw up. Taking off his hat to bow to the lady and gentleman, whilst his refined face was all in a glow, he presented the bulky letter to the latter with the compliments of Mr. Hutton, who would be extremely obliged bjr Mr.Baskerville's conveyance of it to his sister in Nottingham. There was a peevish assent, a curt \" Good day, sir,\" in reply to Vill's expressed hope for their \" safe and pleasant journey,\" an inclina tion of the head and a sweet \" Thank you, sir,\" from the lady as the carriage started again with a sudden jerk. But in that brief moment, whilst Vill stood there bareheaded, eyes had spoken to eyes, and he gazed after them in a dazed but blissful stupor."], [102, "92 IN HIS OWN HAND. Out of Bull Street, through the Minories and the stately Old Square, where the trees had barely begun to bud, into Litchfield Street, along the Litchfield Road, aye, and beyond Aston's noble park and hall, before Mr. Baskerville opened his lips again. And then it was only for the exclamation, \" Why doth he trouble me with his letters? \" This did not distress Cordelia ; she had sunk into a reverie, and was well content with the silence which left her undisturbed. With every mile that increased the dis tance from Birmingham her guardian's good humour returned, and when they stopped to change horses and take refreshment at the Litchfield posting house he had regained his serenity. The next stoppage and change was at Burton, the next Derby, the wearisome day's journey ending at the \" Crown \" Inn, in the Long Row, Nottingham, which they entered when the long vista of thick globular oil lamps were alight, to afford them all a new sensation. To them the illumination was wonderful, although those who, like the writer, can contrast the old oil lamps, set on wooden posts, with gas and electric lighting, will know them for very poor affairs indeed. Excessive weariness and a desire for solitude"], [103, "PRESENTED. 93 made a night's rest very desirable to Miss Carew. She was glad when the heavy supper was over and the obliging hostess herself lighted her to a chamber where stood a thickly curtained four-post bedstead, piled with feather beds one upon another, until bed steps were absolutely necessary. A small room communicating was allotted to Ph\u0153be, who vowed she was \"jolted to bits.\" In the morning our travellers were assured that such was the condition of the Mansfield Road that another pair of horses at the very least, and a postillion who knew the road and its dangers, would be requisite if they hoped to reach Oxton or West Hall in safety. The host remarked, \" There hath been some talk of petitioning Parliament for an Act to make a good turnpike road through the forest, sir, so many accidents have occurred, and so many people have gone astray to their loss and damage ; but I suppose until some of the quality are killed it will end in talk.\" \" Humph ! this is not the only place where projects for improvement end in talk. You have lighted your streets here. You may have your road made by and by,\" quoth Mr. Baskerville, adding, \" you may bring out your horses.\" Four horses for show would have suited the flourishing printer well, but four horses"], [104, "94 IN HIS OWN HAND. to pull his carriage out of deep holes and quagmires was quite another thing, and the extra hint to look to the priming of his pistols was anything but reassuring. \u25a0fe >\"^Mt^ \u25a0; \u201er"], [105, "CHAPTER VIII. WITH MADAM WEST. The marvellous carriage standing in front of the ancient \" Crown \" Inn (twice honoured by the presence of Royalty), attracted a crowd of gazers, as it had done at every stopping place along their route. This gratified Mr. Baskerville, who seated himself beside his ward, and bowed to the smiling host at part ing with much complacence. As they dashed out of the Market Place, and people on the footpaths stood still to watch them pass, he took out his painted snuff-box, deliberately and as gracefully as the swaying motion of the vehicle would permit, in its ascent of Sherwood Street, tittilated his nostrils with his favourite mixture, then flicked away the few grains of fallen powder from his ruffled shirt-front, well satisfied to have excited wonder. His satisfaction died out when they had left the summit of the hill behind and had to cross Thorneywood Moor on the common track known as the Mansfield Road, and he"], [106, "96 IN HIS OWN HAND. began ere long to wish he had been content with a hired chaise. \" Road ! call this thing a road ! \" he grumbled as the carriage plunged down, then up, pitched them forward, then back, and testified its own strength by holding together. \" I wish the old Romans had made a road through this forest. Their Icknield Road between Litchfield and Burton is worthy its name and its makers. Bah ! Everybody's business is nobody's business. I only regret I did not leave my beautiful carriage at home.\" More jolting and shaking, now over the gorse grown waste, anon under the darksome shade of firs, or under the overarching boughs of giant oaks and elms full of the wine of spring, and tipped on every spray with tiny promise of green leaves to be, whilst under neath, the wind blown anemone and the early blue hyacinth disputed the ground with the wood sorrel, the cyclamen and the starry primrose, and the air was odorous of sweet violets. The rumbling wheels drowned the twittering of birds, and the brimstone butterflies fluttered unheeded around as the wheels sank in the old ruts left by the carrier's waggon, and now, once more, rolled smoothly over a patch of fresh vendure. \"Ah, this is better,\" cried he, straightening himself."], [107, "WITH MADAM WEST. 97 Barely had he spoken when the carriage gave another lurch. One wheel sank up to the nave in a deep hole and in the effort to tug it out one of the traces broke. The carriage bade fair to topple over. Ph\u0153be shrieked aloud. Miss Carew bade her be silent. She, herself, though taking the journey against her inclination, had neither complained nor grumbled. \" People who travel,\" she said, \" must expect those incon veniences.\" Indeed it was a very common accident. Coachman and postillion dismounted and set about repairing the damage from a store of odds and ends carried in view of such contingencies. After a sharp expletive or two, Mr. Basker villes hut his lips tightly down over his irrita tion, and sought solace in his snuff-box. The coachman came up to him. \" Would you mind getting out, master, and helping us up with the wheel, there are some queer looking fellows lurking about in the under wood, and it's best we get off as fast as we can.\" \"Humph! If I must, I must,\" said he, getting out with no good-will. He had a tender regard for his garments, and though the ground was dry, the wheels were thick with dust. The feat was at length accomplished, and vol. m. 40"], [108, "98 IN HIS OWN HAND. into his carriage got the gentleman again after some personal shaking and dusting, unaware how near the rough-looking fellows had approached, or that Miss Carew had taken a silver-mounted pistol from a basket, and held it presented, so as to show she knew how to use it, and that they did not travel unarmed. The men scowled and with mut tered curses drew back into their covert. If they had meditated attack, it was not against armed odds. The pistol was still in her hand when Mr. Baskerville resumed his place. \" Ha ! Where did you get that ? \" he asked. \"Pistols are not playthings for girls.\" \" They are not playthings for any one, sir. This was my father's. He taught me how to use it, or to fire a gun, only the year before he died. At all events the plaything has served to keep those evil-looking men at bay, though it is but loaded with powder. A flash is as good as a bullet to scare a coward, and crime and cowardice are twins.\" \"Humph, I think I have seen the trinket before, or one vastly like it,\" said he, as he took it in his hand. Then looking her full in the face, now crimson to the temples, \" In my opinion you are not quitting Birming ham a day too soon, Miss Carew,\" he added in caustic tones."], [109, "WITH MADAM WEST. 99 \" That is your opinion, sir,\" she answered stiffly. \" It may be both too soon and too late.\" He saw he was understood, but the presence of Ph\u0153be prohibited more open speech. After more shaking and jolting and one or two more slight mischances, they passed through Oxton and reached West Hall about mid-day, riding under a long avenue of bud ding trees to the great wooden gates, which stood open to receive them. West Hall was an irregular building of many angles and gables, a fine old specimen of beam and plaster architecture, built on a stone foundation. The main entrance lay back in a nook opposite the gates, though not in the middle of the building, and had an ascent of four broad, low stone steps. The nail-studded door, like the gates, stood hospitably open, and when the carriage stopped Madam West, a woman over forty years of age, whose dark unpowdered hair showed silver threads, and of noble presence, stood there on the topmost step to give them a cordial welcome. She was habited in a rich black velvet robe worn over the conventional hoop, with a deeply-pointed stomacher and a lengthy train. Her tall cap and elbow ruffles of broad hemmed lawn bespoke mourning not yet laid aside, but scarcely more palpably than the sad curve of 40\u20142"], [110, "100 IN HIS OWN HAND. her lips, or the faded light of eyes which in Cordelia's memory had been of deepest grey. A graceful courtesey, and the words \"Wel come to West Hall \" was her first salutation. Mr. Baskerville and Cordelia bowed from the carriage in acknowledgment. The gentleman alighted after a mere \" Your servant madam,\" to the widow, handed out his ward, and led her up the steps, leaving Ph\u0153be and carriage to the care of domestics. \" My dear motherless girl, let me give you cordial welcome to a widowed and childless heart, as well as to West Hall,\" said Madam West, folding Cordelia in a close embrace. \" You have grown into a woman since I saw you last.\" \" Aye, madam, and I have lost a father since that time,\" was answered. Then to Mr. Baskerville she extended a delicate white hand, which he bent over with the formal gallantry of the period. \" Nuttal,\" said the lady with dignified politeness, addressing a respectful servant in waiting, \"attend Mr. Baskerville to his room. I, myself, will accompany my young friend.\" She turned to the gentleman, \" Dinner, sir, will be on the table at one o'clock.\" Wide and square was the hall in which they had been received. The floor was white, laid with local gypsum. The walls were panelled"], [111, "WITH MADAM WEST. 101 with dark oak that had grown upon the land, and was hung with trophies alike of war and chase ; antlers, horns, and hunting spears, bows and arrows, arquebus and musket, sword and shield, with suits of armour in strajr corners where Mr. Baskerville would have placed statues. The staircase they ascended was of noble proportions, with a massive balustrade of carved oak ; and here and there projecting from the wall were half closed hands of wrought iron, once designed to grasp flambeaux. The room allotted to Miss Carew was of moderate dimensions, and still hung with tapestry from ancient looms representing the forest life of Robin Hood and his merry men ; chairs, tables, cabinets, were all of oak and massive, but the drapery of bed and windows, the cushions of chairs and window-seats were of yellow damask, and brightened up what else might have been sombre. \" You have grown very beautiful, my dear Cordelia, almost as beautiful as your mother. It would be a pity were you to throw yourself away.\" So said Madam West, when, with her own hands she had removed the young lady's travelling hood and flat hat, and holding her by the shoulders gazed with admiration on her countenance."], [112, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 102 \" I shall not throw myself away, dear madam,\" replied Cordelia with sufficient dignity ; \" but there are higher qualities than beauty, for which it would be a poor exchange.\" To herself she said : \" So I have come here to be tutored and schooled to Mr. Basker ville's views. Mrs. West has evidently had her instructions. I must ascertain what she has been told.\" She must have appeared dispirited and fatigued, for almost immediatel}- her kind hostess turned to go, after lifting the tapestry which covered a door and saying, \"Your maid will sleep in this small adjoin ing room, I will send her to you. Should you require anything not provided pray ring this bell, and if possible the want shall be supplied. But we, secluded country people, must lack many luxuries common in great towns.\" \" I thank you, dear madam, for 3'our atten tion to my comfort, but nothing seems lacking here,\" and she glanced around, but in her secret heart lurked the feeling of a want not so easily to be supplied. Dinner was a heavy meal in every sense of the word. The profusion on the board could not atone for the weight of the conversation, or the sombre hue of the surroundings. Not only the hostess but Mr. Bulwell, the only"], [113, "WITH MADAM WEST. 103 other guest, was in mourning, he for his dead father, of whom, barring a frilled shirt-front, he seemed a living counterpart, as the old lawyer was when William Hutton sold to him the magazines of Peter Webb. The servants in attendance too wore black, a single stripe .of yellow on their sleeves serving for livery. All this, when black was the exception, became conspicuous and chill ing. Much of the conversation turned on a pending law-suit, and sighing laments were breathed alike for the lost husband and the lost heir, to which Cordelia listened for polite ness sake, with her own thoughts far astray. On the morrow Mr. Baskerville departed, after a long and private interview with Madam West on the subject of his ward's unfortunate predilection for a common apprentice of the lowest rank. Something of this he had inti mated by letter to the lady, as a reason for his desire to remove Miss Carew to safer and more distant guardianship than his own. As his carriage was drawn up close to the stone steps, the postillion, a wiry little man about fifty years old, touched his cap, and said, \" Sir, I hopes yow keeps yowr pistols i' good fettle. Them menaswarr lurking about when th' off wheel stuck fast warr noan good. I'd tak my davy th' one warr long-legged"], [114, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 104 Field, an' if t' other warr na Ben Harris, whose feyther warr hanged, 't warr his ghoast.\" Madam West on the uppermost step over heard, and clasped her hands as if in alarm. \"Alack! if those men be about it behoves us all to be careful. Their presence ever bodes mischief.\" \" No fear, madam, I am a good shot, and have a steady hand. Besides, my coachman carries a blunderbuss, and is not afraid to use it. We are in less danger from plunderers than from the damnable road. Good-bj^e, Cordelia, and may the air of the forest restore you to \u2014 health. Madam West, I kiss your hand. Farewell.\" Contrary to vaticinations they reached Nottingham unmolested. The remainder of the day Mr. Baskerville devoted to business in the town, with booksellers and hardware dealers both, the seats of his carriage serving as receptacles for samples ; no manufacturer then being too grand to do his own travelling for orders or sales. The same process was repeated at Derby, Burton, Litchfield, so that by the time he alighted at Baskerville House he had turned his few days' excursion to profit. For a high-spirited town girl accustomed to sociable intercourse and lively companionship West Hall in its then condition must have"], [115, "WITH MADAM WEST. 105 been most dispiriting. But all the early years of her life Miss Carew had been the denizen of a lonely country house, the companion of a widowed father. And she was not one to brood over misfortunes, or lament disconso lately so as to make all around miserable with her own melancholy. \" I wish I had your rare fund of spirits,\" said Madam West a few days after her arrival ; \"but my life has been marked with losses that have made me sad.\" \" Oh, I have my ' doleful dumps ' some times ; but I shake them off, and, like the brave old knight in ' Chevy Chase,' I feel that ' If my legs were cut away, I'd fight upon the stumps.' Melancholy is not for me, madam. It eats into the heart like a canker if encou raged. I was wont to mount my pony and canter over the field with a great deer-hound scampering after me ; and now that pony and hound are gone, I dash off my dolefuls on my harpsichord, and so make myself fit for my own society and that of others. For better remedy I bide God's good time.\" \" You are a brave girl. I would I more resembled you. Even now I feel your viva city contagious.\" \" You had better try my receipt, madam. What say jrou now to a gallop, or to a brisk"], [116, "106 IN HIS OWN HAND. walk through the village, just to keep the blood from curdling ? \" Madam West looked grave. \" I have never mounted a saddle since \u2014 ah, well, no matter. I must not sadden- you with my sorrows. We will walk. I will place a horse and servant at your disposal if you prefer to ride.\" \" Nay, madam, a walk this breezy day will be exhilarating, and blow the cobwebs off.\" With a sigh the lady assented, and the walk was taken, not merely over the grounds, but beyond the gates and down the avenue, through the village, but even then madam's steps turned towards the little old church, and to a flat tomb under the great yew tree, where on the stone a new name had been sharply incised. Here her tears fell fast, but Cordelia drew her away, and by dint of questions concern ing this or that called her mind to brighter thoughts. By-and-by the village was- left behind, they had strayed from what path there was and stood by the side of a rapid little stream, the same Dover Beck through which the Baskerville carriage had splashed some half-mile farther south. \" It Avas here,\" said Madam West, \" our little darling's velvet cap was found. How"], [117, "WITH MADAM WEST. 107 he had strayed so far we could never divine, but the bank was broken at the edge, and he must have been carried away by the stream.\" \" Alas ! was your son drowned ? \" \" Aye, so we concluded, though we never found another trace of him.\" \" But surely this stream would not have carried his body out of reach ? \" \" It was winter, my dear, a wet, dreary winter, the Beck was full and swollen, the Trent to which it runs was like a turbulent sea. We had not even the poor consolation of kissing his dead lips or laying him to rest in consecrated ground.\" \" Whom God buries are well buried, madam. Neither Moses nor Elijah had a tomb.

The servants went about their daily duties with freer steps. No man or maid seemed afraid to speak above a whisper to another.

Indoors the men-servants were allowed to resume their light liveries, the maids their ordinary apparel.

Cheerfulness prevailed where all had been gloomy and lugubrious. And for it all they were indebted to the influence of a high-spirited girl who, with unflinching fortitude, kept her own heartaches resolutely down, determined to span the dark tide of the present with the rainbow bridge of hope. Whatever were her \" doleful dumps \" she kept them resolutely to herself. Even in the solitude of her tapestried chamber she fought against despondency.

Invitations came for madam and her young friend, and for the sake of that young friend they were accepted. The disused black and yellow carriage was brought into daylight, visits were ceremoniously returned, and more than one young squire fell hopelessly in love with the beautiful heiress. But neither their homage nor their estates had any special attraction for Miss Carew. She found the Squirearchy of Sherwood pretty much what she had known of the Squirearchy of Wor cestershire, and her residence under Mr. Baskerville's roof, where men of many minds and ideas were wont to congregate, had sjioiled her for their society.

Under the shade of the tree nearest to the \" Crown \" Inn Avas placed a drapery stall presided over by a fine, handsome woman of middle age with a ruddy countenance, and resolutely determined but not shreAvish bearing.

So the party, including the brothers Ryland the New Street buckleplaters, and the \"poet Freeth,\"of the coffee-house, had built for them selves a tennis-court in the rear of the \"Bell\" Inn, where they took their pleasure in the summer evenings.

He could not break his engagement or desert his friend at such a crisis in the business ; they had not long fitted up their workshops. The mother entreated, Mr. Bulwell argued, but though Philip Avas respectful he was firm ; and Madam West knoAving the obstinacy of the Wests was afraid of appearing too persistent. She had a Avoman's keen perception of another motive for delay not yet revealed to her. She saw that Philip would not quit Birmingham until he had determined his fate with regard to Miss CareAv."], [173, "PETER WEBB'S SECRET. 163 And she was right. He was not of an exuberant nature, not given to make confi dants. He had not yet become so familiar with his mother as to lay bare the sacred secret of his fathomless loAre, so long sup pressed, for the heiress of Carew Mount. But he had resolved to obtain audience with her and Mr. Baskerville both, before he presented himself at West Hall. Mr. Bulwell too, who scented further litiga tion, proposed to set on foot inquiries for the woman by Avhom Phil was left with William Hutton, and for that purpose the bookseller had himself to be consulted. All he knew he told readily. Showed the last letter of his sister, and advised inquiry at Swithland. Hiring a horse, Mr. Bulwell, grumbling at long absence from his own office, set off to Swithland to put Miss Ward and her sister through the sieve. Meanwhile, Madam West remained at the \" Stork,\" and Phil went back behind the counter, so that no service should be lacking on the busy market-day. He had been for some time preparing the new assistant to take his place, both as bookbinder and salesman, and there remained less to be done.

It was not with the diffidence of a young inventor seeking an influential patron that Philip West mounted the high steps of Basker ville House and asked to see the owner. He had never cringed.

He was not forgetful of the service Mr. Baskerville had rendered him ; but he Avas now lifted to Mr. Baskerville's social level \u2014 his mother would have said above it \u2014 and though he came to solicit a boon it was not as an inferior seeking a favour, but simply as a younger man approaching an elder who had an inestimable gift to bestOAV.

There was a chilling pause after Philip's preliminary salutation.

Noav, indeed, I seek your sanction to lay my humble suit before Miss Carew, and abide her verdict.\" \" You have lost no time, sir,\" cried the elder crossly. \" But I should ill perform my duty to old Squire Carew if I permitted my romantic ward to throw herself and her fortune away on a man who a week ago was nobody \u2014 and who may be nobody a year hence.\" \" You surely will not deny me the favour of an intervieAV with Miss CareAv.

But I do claim as fair a field for my honest love as you allow Mr. Marston, whether as the mere patentee of a lock, or as the owner of West Hall.\" \" And you shall have it, sir,\" said a voice Avhich set Phil's pulses dancing to its exquisite music. The conference had not been carried on in whispers. The door, which had stood ajar, flew open and Cordelia Carew came forward proudly erect, a vision of loveliness in azure quilted satin and Italian gauze, to Avhich a bell-shaped hoop seemed to give additional dignity. Philip flew toAvards her, and taking the hand she extended, raised it reverently to his lips. Mr. BaskerATille started to his feet aghast. \" What !

In that case, I shall throw both myself and my fortune under the pro tection of the Lord Chancellor. I have already consulted with Mr. Bulwell.\" \" The deuce you have ! \" exclaimed Mr. Baskerville coming forward in irate amaze ment, then breaking into the Avrathful ques tion : \" And have you, you, the 'prentice"], [182, "172 IN HIS OWN HAND. lad I have pushed forAvard, being privty to this indignity on your patron ? \" \"I have been privy to nothing, sir,\" answered Philip firmly ; \" but from all I know, and have noAV heard, I consider Miss CareAv justified in her determination. As the guardian appointed by her father, it is doubtless your duty to preserve her from unsuitable addresses ; but when you strain authority to compel her inclinations from private motives, she would do Avisely to seek protection as the laAV provides. For myself, let me say, sir, that although Miss Carew hath been the idol of my adoration for years, the poor apprentice Avas compelled to worship at humble distance, and not until this day Avhen I could offer an unsullied name, did I presume to put forth any pretensions to this fair hand. Of the repulse I met, Miss CareAv appears aAvare ; but if she doth not repulse me I shall not relinquish my pretensions, even though I may have to Avait until she be free to make her own choice.\" \" Free indeed ! Damme, I think the for ward minx hath made her own choice with a vengeance,\" and doAvn on the table Mr. Baskerville threw the painted snuff-box he had half-emptied during this altercation. \" Yes, Guardian, my choice hath long been made ; aye, when my heart outran my head,"], [183, "HER RIGHT OF CHOICE. 173 and I felt only the shame of loving a 'prentice lad. I am not likely to say ' nay ' to Philip West.\" So saying, she turned her eloquent eyes to meet his enraptured gaze, and surrendered her hand to his impassioned kisses, as if proud to sIioav her guardian where her true allegi ance lay. \" But / shall say nay\" cried Mr. Basker ville angrily, \" until your fine 'prentice lad prove the claim set up for him. We shall see whose will is strongest, and Iioav long your foolish fancy lasts.\" He Avas one avIio never yielded to opposition. \" We shall, Mr. Baskerville,\" said the two young people simultaneously. Then with a sudden change of feeling Cordelia rushed up to the old man and laid her hand gently upon his arm. \" Dear Guardy,\" and her eyes Avere humid as she spoke, \" forgive me if I have said aught to grieve you ; but I could not let Philip go away smarting under insult and disappointment.

You know Philip was a favourite of yours at one time, and how do you know but he might invent something to be of use to you.\" John Baskerville was not so easily molli fied, or he would not show it. \" Humph,\" said he, \" Avomen are all alike ! \" and walked out of the room gruffly without shaking hands. But he left them both together and \u2014 they excused it. We need hardly say that the strategic journey to Leamington was deferred sine die ; but that was no token of Mr. Baskerville's surrender. He would not admit his own defeat even when Madam West came in her carriage to his door and sought an interview. o O The utmost he would promise was that Miss Carew should suffer no more annoyance on account of Mr. Marston, and be placed under no undue restraint. \" Let the young man's claim be established to my satisfaction,\" he said, \" and he shall be free to come and go.

Mr. Bulwell had returned from Swithland. Miss Ward and her sister, groAvn feeble old women, had been sharp and close at first, until he made known the object of his inquiries. Then they were as open as he could Avish. They told him that as far back as 1747, Dolly Field had brought lace of her own making to them for sale, but though they knew she lived somewhere in Charnwood, she ahvays evaded inquiries about her home. Indeed they did not even"], [186, "1 76 IN HIS OWN HAND. know her surname until, after missing her for years, she came back with lace for sale just when their old servant lay dying, and offered to take her place. She had proved a faithful, industrious and pious assistant, never going abroad unless to chapel, and then seeming afraid of every stranger she met. At length a big blustering red-haired fellow, with the swagger of a soldier, though he was dressed like a respectable yeoman, came and inquired for her and said Mr. Hutton had sent him. The name had proved a passport for the man, and he was admitted. His coming was evidently a great trouble to Dolly, and from what they overheard they fancied he Avas persuading her to do some thing or go somewhere with him against her will. He went away only to come again a second time, and again a third time. Then one night, when all were abed, she disap peared, carrying her few clothes and her lace cushion away with her. Whether she had gone away with the man, or to avoid him they could not tell. She seemed to have such a dread of him, they thought it must be the latter ; she was too pious to do anything wrong. They had, however, heard only that very summer from their niece, Mrs. Catherine Perkins, a draper in Nottingham, that Dolly"], [187, "HER RIGHT OF CHOICE. 177 Field after much Avandering had gone to lodge Avith her in Bearward Lane, and that she found ready sale at her stall in the market for the poor Avoman's lace. \"Goodness,\" ejaculated Madam West, \"I might have purchased some of that lace, and heard something of the maker but for the insolent message of the stall-keeper, that I must come doAvn to her, she could not come up to me ! \" \" Independent, not insolent,\" corrected Mr. Hutton, who was present. \" The tone of a messenger may turn fact to fable.

Make no delay on our account, Phil had his indentures handed over to him this morning. He is his own master, and hath our hearty good Avishes.\" But William Hutton did not say that he could lay his hand on the man who had troubled the rest of Dolly Field, since he knew it was no concern of the Wests', al though he had made up his mind to call him to account before another day went by. \u2022*s-i 'm\u00c6\"!^~ 45 VOL. III."], [188, "CHAPTER XIV. THE NEW SQUIRE. The morning that saw Philip West seated in his mother's, or, rather, his own carriage, speeding nortlrwards as fast as four post horses could cover the ground, left Patience sighing in the kitchen for the boy she had watched over so long, and sent little Cath erine Hutton crying to school for the Vill who Avould never stand behind her father's counter again, or make pretty playthings for her and Tom. And it sent peaceable William Hutton in quest of his tennis-playing friend Joseph Roper, with anything but a peaceable intent ; notwithstanding his good wife's advice : \" Do not make an enemy of the man, William, if thou canst avoid it.

He took umbrage because a silly lass flouted him and set her cap at me. She was pretty but too bold for my taste. She provoked him to enlist, and in his jealousy he threatened to be revenged on me. I lacked wisdom when his swaggering boast of friendship could mislead me. Be not afraid for me now, he is an arrant coAvard.\" Even as he spoke he was conscious what a coward early oppression had made of himself, and rejoiced that the inert and sluggish blood of the Huttons had been crossed with the vigour and energy of the Wards, Avhich was certainly in the ascendant that Wednesday morning. But he did not take into considera tion how much the change in his social position had done for him. He was now a man of substance and some importance, had been summoned on the Loav Bailiff's jury, and so taken his first step into public life. As he had risen in public estimation so had he risen in his own. And was he not already in treaty for a small landed property in Worcestershire ? He felt himself quite equal to cope with the blustering ex-dragoon. It was the third week in July, the month 45\u20142"], [190, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 180 which had been so marked a feature in the calendar of his life. He found the man he sought, in the easily negligent undress of shirt and breeches, unfastened at the knees, (it was thirty years before the era of braces), a long clay pipe in his mouth, a half-empty tankard of ale before him, and the remnants of a beefsteak told Avhat his breakfast had been. He leaned back in a big arm-chair, with his slippered feet crossed on the broad window seat. \" Hah ! friend Hutton,\" he began with a lofty flourish of his pipe in the air, but his bombastic greeting was arrested by the curt \" Mr. Roper, I want a word Avith you,\" of his early visitor. \"A dozen if you like,\" quoth the other, pointing with his pipe stem to a seat, which William Hutton disregarded. \" Sir,\" said the latter, \" I find you have used my name to obtain access to a poor woman whose misfortunes should have been her shield against intrusion and persecution. Used it for ends so base that only flight remained for her ! \" \"Oho! my virtuous friend! Is that it? All's fair in love or war. Did you think to keep a dainty tid-bit snug to yourself among your shopkeeping relations ? Might not one old flame be as good as another to her ? \""], [191, "THE NEW SQUIRE. 181 \" You scoundrel ? \" cried William, now thoroughly roused. \" Have you no heart that you cast a slur on an honest married woman, too virtuous to accept your OAvn lawless offers ? For myself \u2014 Pshaw ! \" Roper had taken a pull at the tankard ; he put it down and sat erect, glaring fiercely at William Hutton across the table. \" Heart ? Had I no heart when I saw you trifling with Dolly Parker ; taking my pretty sweetheart from me before my face ? Had I no heart when I 'listed and left her to you ? My God, man ! I felt I could have murdered you for her sake then.\" \" Me ! I Avanted none of Dolly Parker, she was too forward for my taste.\" \" D \u2014 n you ; so it suited you to say when you jilted her, and flung her off to marry that vile ruffian Francis Field. But I swore revenge, and I had time in camp and garrison to brood on my revenge, and I shall have it yet ; for all that Dolly is you have made her. If you did not want her she wanted you, and I was treated like a dog between you. And you thought the clasp of the soldier's hand was friendly, did you ? Ha, ha ! What about the corn-mill that was to grind out a fortune for you ? What of the tennis-court ? Do you think I cared for your health or your amusement? Not I. Tennis is thirsty and exciting sport."], [192, "182 IN HIS OWN HAND. I thought I could lead you on to drink and wager on the game. But if, in your niggard liness, you have baffled me there, you will not baffle me when next I have the upper hand.\" And he emphasized the threat with a malicious grin and a tremendous oath it is needless to record. Be sure after this Roper was seen no more at the tennis-court. His SAvagger and blas phemy had already made him offensive to the Rylands and other sober-minded tradesmen of the club, and his absence was hailed with sat isfaction. The SA\\-earing trooper disappeared from his different haunts, and so very many peaceful years went by AATithout sign or token of the man that Roper and his threats were forgotten, as were the little tailor and Francis Field. Meamvhile the yellow carriage dashed along, the setting sun emblazon d'or upon the doors glancing in the light. Fain would Philip West have obtained a parting interview with Miss Carew, before he was hurried off to Notting ham, but that was denied and he had to be content with pouring out his regret on paper, telling all that was hoped from his journey, and looking forAvard to a speedy and triumph ant return that should dissipate her guar dian's last objections. To Philip, whose only remembrance of"], [193, "THE NEW SQUIRE. 183 travel was of a midnight ride in a jolting cart, or a footsore tramp through rain and mud, or glare and dust, the journey in a cushioned carriage behind four post horses seemed like a flight through fair)'land ; the trees, the fields, the villages seemed to melt away behind them as they dashed on, and notwithstanding the jolting of the lumbering *-*- .' **\"* o vehicle where the roads were exceptionally bad, he, for the first time, fully realized the rise he had made in life. Cottage children by the wayside lingered and dropped Ioav courtesies, or pulled their sun-bleached forelocks as they passed, horsemen doffed their three-cornered hats in courteous salutation, and at the posting-houses where they stopped for re freshment and change of horses, innkeepers and underlings Avere alike obsequious and deferential. In Birmingham his sudden eleva tion had excited Avonder, and sometimes rude comment, but no one had boAved down to the 'prentice \u2014 turned squire. Along the road, where his antecedents Avere unknown, the carriage and the respectful old coachman be spoke for him equal recognition with Madam West. He was young and mortal. He had left drudgery behind. A new world Avas opening out to him. The unmistakable lady by his side treated him with proud affection as her"], [194, "184 IN HIS OWN HAND. equal in all things ; the lawyer, without any servility, addressed him as squire and sir, with the careful intonation Avhich marked a sense of difference in their stations. There Avas nothing of the tradesman in his attire, his mother had taken care of that the day the will was read. His velvet suit came from no common loom. The buttons on his wide skirted coat, the buckles at his breeches knee and across his high instep Avere of solid gold ; his kevenhuller hat Avas laced with gold, the ruffles of his shirt were of the finest lawn, and if he had no aristocratic sword by his side, there Avere gloves upon the hands labour had stained. The gloss of newness had not worn awajr from them or the feeling of strangeness from him, but casual beholders would not notice this. It would have been singular if the subtle influence of his surroundings, and the deference of strangers had not affected his bearing somewhat. He had held his head higher and trod the ground with firmer step from the moment the bonds of Francis Field were snapped. That he Avas not inflated by his sudden elevation might be due to his previous experience of flattery over his safety bolt and lock. His manners had ahvays been above the average ; polite consideration for others had been the law of the Hutton household. When"], [195, "THE NEW SQUIRE. 185 the carriage stopped at the ancient \"Crown\" Inn, he assisted his mother to alight and led her up the steps with unconscious ease. Tavo or three country gentlemen loitering near the entrance, doffed their hats to Madam West, as she passed in. \" By jove ! \" cried one. \" Did you ever see such a likeness ? \" \" By jingo ! \" exclaimed another. \" He is Philip West's image.\" \" Gentlemen,\" said she, gracefully bending as she turned and proudly presented the fine young man, \" he is Philip West, our long lost son. He will be pleased to receive his dead father's friends at West Hall.\" She courtesied, Philip boAved, and the tAvo went forward towards the waiting host, leav ing Mr. Bulwell to satisfy curiosity at his own discretion, and to dispatch a mounted mes senger to the Hall for everything to be in readiness. Through his clerk the great news had already been conveyed thither. This recognition almost in the Market Place had been highly gratifying both to Madam and Philip ; it seemed to point to an easy settlement of his rightful claim. After dinner, served in a private room, where was no one to criticize any possible solecism in the etiquette of the time (in which eating with the knife was not to be counted,"], [196, "186 IN HIS OWN HAND. so long as the sharp edge of the blade was turned away from the lips), and Avhere Philip acquitted himself beyond his lady-mother's anticipations, the three rose and together bent their steps toAvards the humble abode of Catherine Perkins, to whom Philip was the bearer of letters from her brothers William and Thomas. There they encountered their first disap pointment. Drapery goods had possession of one broad Avindow. There had been a whip and saddle in another, but habits had been contracted by Samuel and his family in their wandering camp-life that clashed with all Catherine's instincts, and she had speedily found means to transfer and settle him and his business in a busier part of the town. They found her in possession of old Peter Webb's \u2014 or Philip West's \u2014 signet ring, and Avilling to surrender it for what she had given, but though Susannah Finch was there spinning industriously, there was no sign of her they sought. She had gone aAvay the Aveek before, whither no one could say. Something she had said before she went of disburdening her mind, but Catherine remarked, \" I don't pry into other folk's secrets. What they don't tell I don't ask. Mrs. Field was a steady and pious Avoman, worked hard and paid"], [197, "THE NEW SQUIRE. 187 honestly. She'd ne'er have gone away without good reason.\" Philip carried away on his finger his grand father's signet ring, but that was all they had so far gained by the hurried journey. From Bearward Lane there Avas a visit to Smith's bank, alike for the introduction of the neAV squire, and the deposit of the order on the Bank of England found so unexpectedly among Peter Webb's long neglected papers. The banker Avas effusive in his congratula tions, complimented Philip on his extra ordinary likeness to his father and grandfather, and gave his opinion that the usurper of Westhorpe had not a leg to stand upon, and Madam West came away beaming with satisfaction. And then followed a solemn visit to a grave in St. Mar}r's ground, inscribed, \" Peter Webb, died 1742.\" There Avas a damper aAvaiting them at West Hall. The coming of the long lost heir had been proclaimed. The great gates stood open, tenantry and servants lined the drive and the entrance hall. As the carriage droA^e to the door and they alighted, hats and kerchiefs Avaved, and shouts uprose of \" Long live the heir.\" \" Welcome back to West Hall.\" \" Aye, Philip, Avelcome back to the home"], [198, "1 88 IN HIS OWN HAND. of your ancestors,\" said the lady as she gave her hand to him at the foot of the steps. At the top she turned, and Avhile Philip, over powered, could only bow in acknoAvledgment, she thanked them in his name with graceful dignity, and then he, having recovered his composure, said a few straightfonvard words of thanks and promise which raised another deafening chorus of \" hoorays.\" As he passed through the hall he scarcely saAvthe boAving servants. The noble staircase with its carved newels and balustrade, and steps of solid oak, the armour, antlers, Aveapons, flambeau -sconces all seemed to come upon his memory like a landscape out of the mist. \" My old dreams were but remembrances,\" he said to his mother afterAvards, but at that moment Nuttal, who also seemed to have a place in his past, stepped out of the ranks to inform his mistress that a tidy, middle aged AA-oman, carrying a basket and a lace cushion, had been there on the Monday, very desirous to see Madam West. \"Shu said as shu had just heered as madam's son had been lost sixteen year, an' shu thowt shu knew where he mowt be found.

Nuttal, Avhy did you suffer her to depart unquestioned? We have been travel ling post in search of that very woman. Her testimony would be most important,\" and madam swept past him into the old squire's library on their right and sank into a chair, less from exhaustion than disappointment, \" Be not troubled on Mrs. Field's account, dear madam,\" said Philip bending over her. \" She may return, or, if not, her voluntary statements to Mrs. Perkins and your servant are in themselves evidence.\" \" Aye, my son, if Ave had honourable people to deal with, but Mr. Bulwell can tell you they will resort to any chicanery before they sur render Westhorpe.\" \" Ah, that they will,\" replied Mr. Bulwell. \" Your discovery will no doubt be a blow to them, but possession is nine tenths of the law-, and our opponents will not admit your claim without a struggle.

Philip was no horseman, he could not fire a gun, he had been brought up temperately and religiously, was neither inclined to drink ing, sAvearing, nor dicing, and shrank with disgust from cock-fighting, ratting, and other brutalizing sports. This Avas no recommendation even to his own tenantry, but as they Avere neither bullied nor brow-beaten, and he was not over strict in the matter of game, was \" free spoken,\" and introduced many little contrivances into their homes for comfort or convenience, they began to respect him in spite of his \" town ways.\" Mr. Baskerville was not so easily won over."], [201, "CHAPTER XV. A REASON FOR A RHYME. Mr. Marston had made the best of the situa tion and withdrawn his suit, leaving the field open to his rival. But Mr. Baskerville, irritated alike by the decisive rejection of his wife's nephew, by the insufficient profits upon his printing, and the difficulty he experienced in the disposal of the rare types he had himself designed and pro duced with so much cost and labour, was not willing to accept for his rich ward the young man he had himself patronized and befriended as a poor 'prentice lad. He was, moreover, disappointed that an inventor of so much promise should be lost to the manufactures and trades of Birmingham. And though he was not so unkind as to debar the admission of Philip, when, at intervals of a few weeks, he came riding over with a servant behind him all the way from Sherwood to see her, he was careful to let them know he received Mr. Philip West under protest ; and that he could give no sanction to marriage, so long as his heirship was disputed."], [202, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 192 \" Never mind, Phil,\" said Cordelia brightly, when he lamented this and the miles that dh-idedthem ; \" the pain of absence is forgotten when you come, and Avhen you depart I dash my tears away and look forward to the joy of your return.

He would abandon his claim to Westhorpe rather, nay, return to Birmingham and carry on the lock-making in person. Indeed, all his proclivities went with the handicraftsman, his associations were chiefly Avith the labouring and trading community. He had little in common Avith the country squires who formed his new society, and his e}res were blinded to the charms of their sisters and daughters. He could not rust in inaction. He made designs for iron latches and fastenings for cottage doors to supersede the clumsy wooden things pulled open by a string and a bobbin from Avithout, as in the days of Little Red Riding Hood, and strong catches and fasten ings for Avindows never before opened to let in the fresh air ; and then he sent the designs to Jack Cotterwell to carry out. Then he supplied the extra capital the growing concern demanded, and was quite as proud of the business he had created as of the landed estate secured by his grandfather's will. His mother sighed and shuddered, tracing back his plebeian instincts to her OAvn mother's remote connections \u2014 the Birmingham chaser and the sword-maker. Those very instincts were thawing Mr. Baskerville's ice Avith every fresh appearance Phil put in. He had seen for himself how the vol. in. 46"], [204, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 194 lock and bolt making-AVorks in Egdbaston Street were prospering, had taken advantage of occasional hints the designer had thrown out for his own use ; but nearly eighteen months had been checked off from the three years before he was thoroughly Avon over. The tea-board of the period was of polished wood, generally mahogany. Mr. Baskerville had already introduced lighter trays of compressed paper, japanned .and pictorially decorated, such as are still in use. \"Suppose,\" said Phil to him one day, \"after you had laid on your ordinary coats of varnish, you were to lay gold-leaf or silver leaf in small irregular dabs upon it ; then -over all another coat of varnish, and pumice .stone down until the metal Avas visible be jneath ; I think it Avould produce a novel effect.\" \" Humph ! \" muttered the japanner, \" there can be no harm in trying.\" The experiment Avas made. A sort of transparent mottling Avas the result ; and in a very short time Baskerville's tortoise-shell trays were all the rage ; the process Avas a secret, and the returns were surprising. In his satisfaction the old japanner sAval loAved his qualms of conscience concerning Phil, and magnanimously said, \" If I had a"], [205, "A REASON FOR A RHYME. 195 daughter to give you should have been welcome to her. You can marry Cordelia when you will.\" But, \" when you will,\" meant when settle ments were drawn out ; Phil's own peremptory decree being the absolute settlement of Carew Mount upon the heiress ; a decree she resisted until Mr. Baskerville joined issue with Mr. West, saying, \" My dear, you must hold Carew Mount as a harbour of refuge for Philip, in case the harpies of the law- should swallow up Westhorpe and West Hall like wise, with all the locks and bolts to boot.\" \"I should be loth to press Cordelia to share my fortunes if I thought such a disaster possible,\" returned Philip with a flash of independence. But Philip hardly knew what a protracted law-suit meant, Madam West accompanied her son to Birmingham for the wedding, fixed for the second week in April, to insure passable roads. It had been her desire to see them married in the little old church of Oxton, where the Wests had plighted their troth for centuries, but when Philip decided that Jack Cotterwell, and Jack Cotterwell only, could be his groomsman, and that the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Hutton was equally indispensable, she forbore to press the point, although she did not yield without reluctance. Perhaps 46\u20142"], [206, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 196 the suggestion of her own Avoman, a privileged individual, that Oxton Church had not proved a lucky one either in her OAvn case, or that of her own parents, served to turn the balance. But it is certain she shrank from inviting under her roof, amongst the county friends she would call round her to Avitness the auspicious ceremony, either the uneducated blacksmith's son, or the bookseller who had kept the little shop in Southwell, and whose sister had a stall in the Nottingham market. In the home-coming festivities she felt there need be no jarring of uncongenial elements ; and for her son to have captivated the beautiful and elegant Miss CareAv, heiress of Carew Mount, Avould only suggest genteel acquaintance in the years of his absence from home ; so she came to the conclusion that Philip's arrangement was \" perhaps the best after all.\" Private carriages were so rare and public chaises of so comparatively recent introduc tion, that even prosperous people walked in procession to be married, or went on horse back at the head of a cavalcade. The bridal therefore created no small commotion, and under the budding trees in St. Philip's green churchyard was quite a gathering of spectators. A polished-up chaise with wedding-favours on the horses' heads"], [207, "A REASON FOR A RHYME. 197 could not stand at William Hutton's door and take up the new Overseer and his wife, Avho had thrown off mourning for the occasion, Avithout attracting attention, any less than the stoppage in NeAV Street to include the brothers Ryland, who were as much of pattern-cards in the Avay of plated buckles as Avas Mr. Basker vdlle's resplendent pictorial carriage, Avith its pair of long-tailed cream-coloured steeds, the pattern-card of the artistic japanner. And certainly, never bride who did not call the Lord Mayor father, ever set out to meet her bridegroom in greater state. The yellow car riage Avhich bowled off from the Square Avith Madam West, the bridegroom, groomsman, and Mr. Bulwell, paled beside so much magnifi cence. And Mr. Baskerville, carrying up the aisle his gold-topped cane, was himself as resplendent as blue velvet, gold-lace and buttons could make him. Philip, Avho scarcely knew himself in his suit of traditional canary-coloured satin, with buttons and buckles of gold set Avith amber, saw nothing much beside a vision of white satin, pearls and point-lace, and pronounced the responses scarcely assured all Avas not a vision to vanish with awaking. He was, however, not so dreamy as to suffer another to take the first kiss of his bride, though her expanded hoop did protest. And"], [208, "198 IN HIS OWN HAND. the sense of strangeness wore off among the congratulations of friends, and the day's fes tivities, during which William Hutton read aloud a lengthy poetical adxlress to the newly married man, which, if not Tennysonian or Swinburnian, Avas fully appreciated there, and contained some excellent advice, as one or tw-o extracts will show. TO A NEW MARRIED MAN. 'Tis easy when married to put away strife, Because a good husband will make a good wife, Draw gently, he loving, good-humoured, and still, Then you may be happy as long as you will. Dear friend, I'm given to understand, You've ta'en a loving wife in hand And probably expect to share Like others, pleasures without care : Serenity and sunshine too, Are things with ease you bring to view. But pray what title have you got To what, the major part have not ? For where one's blest who takes a wife, There's two repent it during life. Yet this state is, though ills invade, The happiest state that e'er was made ; For if the evils we're combating Are evils of our own creating, We with some prudence then may shun them Or cut them short when we've begun them : The traveller should never lack, To strike into the cleanest track. Allow then an experienced mate, Long practised in the married state, To tell you where, if you're not blind, Content and pleasure you may find."], [209, "A REASON FOR A RHYME. 199 'Tis said that state is harmony, When wife and husband both agree : But I maintain, bliss holds its place When half this only is the case : Then who would miss this paradise, When he can have it at half-price ? Use all attention on your part, To keep as well as gain her heart ; Nor act the child, when at its play, To cry for what it throws away : You'll find this of all gems found yet The richest in your cabinet. Should common errors be descried, Those errors ne'er in public chide ; Tenderly touch without abuse ; Nay softly plead her own excuse : This calls that pride forth in the end Which ever shows a wish to mend, To cherish love, and make it thrive, Attempt to lead but never drive. To persevere be much inclined, Thus you will mould her to your mind. Contentions in the married state From nothing oft originate : A candle's end, a thread, a pin, Are quite sufficient to begin ; Answers, rejoinders and replies, Make many a serious quarrel rise, Which terminates in deep vexation, Nay, sometimes leads to separation. Whene'er such altercations start, Let silence end them on your part, Then the grand point you win with ease, And you may win whene'er you please."], [210, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 200 When you in company shall meet her, With kind attention always treat her : Your satire, banter, laugh, or sneer, On no account must glance at her ; Nor let her e'er be placed by you In a degrading point of view. If of the two you hold most sense Then let it act in her defence. These maxims I observed \u2014 adieu, If not worn out will profit you. For the rest jovialty and broad humour characterized the feast, over Avhich Mr. Basker ville and his Avife presided with genial hospi tality, and on which their carved busts looked down in placid coldness. Indeed, Avhen the happy pair drove aAvay the next morning to Nottingham with Madam and the lawyer, Philip was pleased to think that his wedding had been the means of re newing intimacies which, of late years, had been somewhat strained, and of raising his trad ing friends somewhat in his mother's estima tion. At all events an invitation to visit West Hall in the summer had been given to Mr. and Mrs. Hutton, and had been accepted. Then Mr. Baskerville, AAdio for some time had not been on speaking terms with Mr. Hutton, had shaken hands with him in hearty welcome, and in toasting the rhyming book seller had congratulated the town on his"], [211, "A REASON FOR A RHYME. 201 appointment as overseer, and congratulated him on \" coming round to common sense.\" The explanation of this was, that after Mr. Baskerville's visit to lamp-lit Nottingham in 1765, he had left no stone unturned to obtain a Bill for lighting, cleansing and otherwise improving Birmingham, and had found active coadjutors in Dr. Ash, John Taylor (the neAV banker), the Rylands, and other influential members of the community, but there Avere people Avho preferred darkness rather than light, not because their deeds were evil, but because they objected to pay extra levies, or Avould be called upon to remove time-honoured nuisances. Of these opponents William Hutton had been the chief; the paper war had been strong and virulent, his pen advocating dark ness and things as they were with very falla cious reasoning, simply because his OAvn interests Avere threatened. The drafted Bill required the removal of the GateAvay block of buildings for the opening out of New Street. He took it as a threat to sweep away the-business which had made him, and by which he Avas \" adding acre to acre \" of land here and there. Nay, until he had lost another son there had been no convin cing him that the site was unwholesome and the removal of the Swine and Beast Market"], [212, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 202 imperative, and even then he prolonged his opposition until the Bill Avas so altered as to leave his premises intact. It Avas on this slight concession Mr. Bas kerville had congratulated him, for the boy who had tramped into the toAvn footsore and hungry had become a man of influence in their midst. His opposition removed, the Lamp Act was obtained, although shorn of its fair propor tions, chiefly through his means. As if to prove hoAV factitious his violent op position had been, when the \" Garland \" Inn, with a mortgage upon it was privately offered for sale, William Hutton snapped at the opportunity and became the purchaser, paying a certain sum down and letting the mortgage lie. Then he became one of the most zealous supporters of an amended Bill for street improvement, and most anxious to see NeAV Street opened out by the downfall of the Gateway. But not until the Street Act had become law and his OAvn premises were condemned did he disturb a brick of his new purchase. That settled, he might himself have been seen at four in the morning, Avith his oath hands, helping to pull doAA-n the ancient pile of beam and plaster, and to build up a fine new house and warehouse on the site. Prior to that he had aAvakened to the fact"], [213, "A REASON FOR A RHYME. 203 that the old Leather Hall premises were too cramped for business and residence both, and were not healthy. His speculations in land had so far been profitable, though he was draining his business for them. He made a fresh pur chase at Bennett's Hill, Saltley, where more than once in his tramping journeys to and fro he had lingered to admire the natural panorama spread before him. Here, to be in readiness, he began to build a house which should rival Mr. Baskerville's, and was adding a couple of low wings there when the \"Garland\" house was pulled down. The furniture of the old business-place went into the new one, including the old desk, but other and more stylish additions were made ; the grounds at Bennett's Hill were laid out ; and then there was another furnishing, when mahogany and damask were the rule, not old-fashioned, and Avhere plate, and glass, and china filled closets and presses without stint, where foreign wines found a place in the cellar, and not only a horse for his own use, but a pony for Tom had posses sion of the stabling. There was also a mare kept for the convenience of Brother Thomas, who had a long courted sweetheart in Staffordshire, but the mare was stabled behind the neAV Garland House."], [214, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 204 The paper-merchant had reached that point where money multiplies itself, and capital does more work than the master's own hand ; though to that said \"own hand\" he still ascribed his success. How much he OAved to slow and sure Thomas he failed to estimate, for although he had ever a careful eye to business and a ready hand that was not dainty, he was inclined to make a show and take his pleasure. Then he had also plunged into debt with his building and land buying, which was not all profit, and at much of which Thomas shook his head. There Avere journeys to Aston, journeys to Nottingham and West Hall in the summer time, and there Avas public business to boot in which his soul delighted. The little Quaker child, whose hat he had saved from the river, had bloomed into a stylish matron in satin and brocade, lace and laAA-n. There Avas no suggestion of broken boots and dilapidated garments in the kerseymere or broadcloth coats and satin breeches of the gentleman Avho was dubbed esquire by his fellows. For William Hutton had ceased to be a mere overseer of the poor, and become one of the most active of all the commissioners of the Lamp and Street Acts he had formerly opposed. And until those same commissioners SAvept the Old Cross aAvay, and found the"], [215, "A REASON FOR A RHYME. 205 court a more convenient and important location, he might be found tAvo days a week shrewdly dispensing justice as a commissioner in the Court of Conscience or Requests, in the room above the steps where he had once sat friendless, hopeless and homeless. And there Ave must leave him for awhile, alike making enemies and friends Avith his shreAvd even-handed decrees, whilst Ave follow the fortunes of others. .<^yt/:/^yp"], [216, "CHAPTER XVI. THE MISSING WITNESS. The Court of Conscience or of Requests was a court of equity, established during the Tudor dynasty for the recovery of debts under five pounds. Money changed its value, the limit of the court did not, but its application was Avide, its fees were small, and there was no vexatious delay. But for the debtor who could not pay, and whose creditor was harsh, there Avas always the prison in prospect, generally a loathsome pit of disease and iniquity. It was William Hutton's endeavour to soften the rule of the court, but whatever the decision, plaintiff and defendant both could rarely be satisfied. He himself, dispensing justice to small debtors, was, in course of time, hampered and harassed by debts and duns consequent on his land-buying, or rather brought about by a piece of rascality afterwards traced to Roper as the wire puller of the legal puppets. A property was offered to him in 1779, at a low figure, the bulk of Avhich was to remain on"], [217, "THE MISSING WITNESS. 207 mortgage. He was averse to buy. It was pressed upon him. The bargain had barely been made six months when the lawyer threatened foreclosure unless the mortgage was paid off peremptorily. To find the six hundred pounds so unexpectedly was most embarrassing and crippling to his business, already suffering. It was almost a repetition of his corn-mill experience. And in his en larged premises larger capital was required. The business itself Avas too sure, and the returns too large to make the congestion more than temporary. In spite of debts he was rapidty making a fortune, and people he was passing in the race Avere as envious as the little tailor had been, if they did not show it as openly. Ere long he gave the ill-disposed fresh cause to look askance, for not only Birming ham, but all literary England rang Avith his name. In removing his stock and furniture from the old premises to the Garland House, which, ere long, looked from its many eyes down the long vista of regenerated New Street, the package of papers he had bought from Mr. Finch, carefully labelled by Phil, came to light. He had no leisure to sort them at the time, but they reneAved an old idea.

And in the autumn of the year that confirmed Philip West's position, he had ready for the press as unique a \" History of Birmingham \" as any author ever Avrote of any town ; though it was not until March, 1782, that the work was published. The publication of his first book is an im portant event in the life of any man ; how much more so when the author has been self educated and has risen to eminence by his own perseverance and application. It Avas a proud moment for William Hutton, Avhen his sister Catherine, leaving her business in the care of Susannah Finch, hired a chaise and came all the ay ay from Nottingham to congratulate him, attended by their brother Samuel and his son. It was as proud a moment for Catherine Perkins, who told her niece and namesake (then a clever Avoman, in her twenty-sixth year, her mother's nurse and deputy, and herself an embryo author), \" You may thank your old aunt's discernment for the great triumph of this day. I saw that William was destined to raise the name of Hutton out of the dust, and I lent the lad a helping hand."], [219, "THE MISSING WITNESS. 209 This book repays me a thousand-fold,\" and she laid her hand on the copy he had pre sented to her. It Avas altogether a memorable year to him. In July he returned his sister's visit, when he remarked to her, \"A man may live half a cen tury and not be acquainted with his own character. I did not knoAvIwas an antiquary till the world informed me from reading the \" History.\" When told I could perceive it my self. The Antiquarian Society at Edinburgh has chosen me a member, and sent me a diploma to splice F.A.S.S. to my name. You little expected that, Catherine ? \" He as little expected that a second edition would be called for before the year Avas out, or that a hearty dinner eaten in haste Avould bring him near the verge of the grave. As it Avas, the author's first book bade fair to be his last. But he had the best of nurses in Catherine and her mother, who ignored her OAvn illness to Avatch night and day beside the husband dearer than herself. He had also in Dr. Ash an undaunted and skilful practitioner, and he had a sound constitution to bear the repeated blood-letting, then deemed imperative. To the joy of his own family, and that of the Wests', \" finis \" was not written to his life's volume prematurely. He lived to do them and the Avorld good service ere that came about, vol. iu. 47"], [220, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 210 and the doctor made a marvellous mistake when he said : \" You will never be the man you have been.\" Anxiety and attention to him had done far more permanent evil to his good little Avife, and not all the thousands he was then worth could arrest the progress of the malady sloAvly sapping her life. To bring back health a man and horse were at her service for daily exercise on a pillion. She visited Aston and the Wests', but to little advantage. It was to Carew Mount she rode. That mansion Philip and his wife had for some time occupied as a residence when increasing busi ness demanded his frequent presence at the flourishing works of Cotterwell and Co., although they spent most of their time with Madam West in their Sherwood home. Like a sunbeam Cordelia West had irradiated the old Hall she entered as a bride. From her force of character not less than the prestige of her own family name she took her fitting place in county society, and all that Avas doubtful about Philip's antecedents A^anished when they stood side by side, he polishing and refining from constant association with his wife and mother.

There is not. a question that they idolized each other, and Avhen children Avere born to them, if possible the mother Avas dearer to him than the wife ; and her faith in him never wavered. The only bar to their happiness was the tenacity Avith Avhich the usurping Oliver West held Westhorpe, and disputed Philip's title. As Mr. Baskerville had predicted, Philip found the establishment of his claim both more difficult and more costly than he had at all calculated. There Avere actions and appeals, the cause Avas traversed from court to court, and when Mr. Baskerville died in 1775, and was buried in a vault on his own premises self-prepared in the conical building Avhere he had cast his famous type (the Baskerville type still unsold), the West law-suit was still undetermined.

Then, local organs failing, the Times was tried, with no better success.

West v. West was still in the law-courts. It Avas now the plea of Oliver West that Philip Avas the child of Dolly Field, and as her child had been apprenticed ; and that the late Philip West of Westhorpe and West Hall Avas the actual father, thus accounting for natural resem blance. It Avas urged that Dolly Avas a flippant, bold young Avoman Avhen Francis Field married her ; that he was knoAvn to be jealous of his wife, and to be vindictive against Squire West ; that he and his wife had many quarrels, and finally separated on account of the boy ; and that the story of his being stolen had been trumped up to excite compassion and cover her own shortcomings Avhen the lad's features excited inquiry. If true, Avhy did she not come forAvard with her testimony ? The plea Avas plausible, the difficulty to prove a negative great.

The laAv-clouds hung low and ominous. Even Mr. Bulwell shook his head and looked grave. A ray of wintry sunshine flitting through the court-room of the Birmingham Old Cross came to disperse them. The doom of the Old Cross was sealed. It was destined to come down before the year Avas out. Only a day or two remained for it, when amongst the numerous causes brought before the commissioners Avas that of a poor woman to recover from a man named Thomas Green, a needle-book containing a few shillings, which she had lost and he had found. Re fusing to restore it he had cursed her abusively, and claimed it as his own. William Hutton, the untiring, was upon the bench as president, in the best of health and spirits. As the Avoman came before him to make her plaint he regarded her attentively, wonder ing if the poorly-dressed old creature, Avith care-lined face and thin white hair, could ever have been knoAvn to him in his young days.

Then he asseverated boldly that the lost property was his. \"I fairly fun' it, an' I reckon ivrythin a mon finds is his own.\" \" And so you apprehend the street gives a title to Avhatever lies upon it? \" said the judge steadily. \" You forget that property cannot change its owner without an act of that owner.

Of Phil's restoration to his mother she already knew. In a couple of minutes she was shown into the parlour of the Garland House, to find William Hutton and the judge who had tried her one and the same. There was cold beef and ale upon the table, and she was invited to partake. But in less than half-an-hour she and William Hutton were speeding away in one of the new hackney coaches down the paved and cleared Bull Ring, and after a brief stoppage in Edgbaston Street at the works of Cotterwell & Co. for inquiry, away along the Edgbaston road, as fast as the horses could carry them, out of Warwickshire into Worcestershire to the fine stone mansion of CareAv Mount.

And Avhen it Avas further proA-ed by other testimony that the said Peg Harris had been transported to Virginia for maliciously and revengefully compassing the death of Philip's father, animus was proven, and it needed but the evidence of Philip's own injured hand to settle the matter con clusively in his favour. Oliver West, Avho had spent the previous night in a carouse with his friends, gnashed his teeth and vowed he Avould appeal to the House of Lords. But that was an idle threat. The suit of West v.

Yet it never came into Philip's possession after all. Legal costs and dissipation had swallowed up the estate like quicksands. And Oliver West, Avho contrived to drink himself to death in less than six months, also contrived to keep afloat the idea that Philip was not the true heir. Cordelia could only congratulate Madam West and her adored husband on retaining West Hall indisputably. \" We are rich enough, my love,\" she said to him, \" and surely two homes may suffice for us and ours. But we must make a home for the poor tempest-tossed creature who has done us so signal a service.\" \" Aye, aye, my Cordelia, she must never leave us.

The French Revolution had set all Europe in a ferment, until in England \"Freedom\" and \"Loyalty\" became party watchwords to inflame the worst passions of men.

All that is needful is some self-interested bias, or determined opposition, and then the dogged obstinacy of the man who will not allow himself to be beaten either in argument or action asserts itself, and he Avill blindly fight tooth and nail for that of which he really knows little and cares less.

Republicanism and atheism Avere in 1791 rampant on the other side of the Channel, and in their terror lest the contagion should spread to their own land, well-meaning Englishmen created scarecrows out of very harmless materials. Freedom of opinion was not tolerated, and dissent had a hard time of it. On the early evening of July the 14th, 1741, William Hutton limped into Birmingham a poor homeless wanderer. On the 14th of July, 1791, just fifty years to the day and hour, a devastating storm broke over the tOAvn and drove him forth again homeless, shelterless, friendless. The tradesman had been too prosperous, the commissioner of local acts had been too strenuous in the abolition of nuisances and encroachments, the judge too impartial in the administration of justice. His enemies were of all classes, yet he blindly thought himself without a foe. On the 14th of July \u2014 a fateful month for him \u2014 a party calling themselves \" The Friends of Freedom \" celebrated the anniversary of the downfall of the Bastille by a dinner at an hotel in Temple Row.

A seditious handbill was circulated privately. This was followed by a reply headed, \" An Incendiary Refuted ;\" by an offered \" reward of a hundred pounds \" to discover the writer of the seditious handbill ; and by a printed manifesto from the commemorationists em phatically disclaiming all knowledge of the inflammatory handbills, and averring their \" firm attachment to the Constitution of their own country.\" Nevertheless, the eighty-one gentlemen who sat down to the dinner at three o'clock were hissed and hustled as they passed into the hotel by a violent crowd of people assembled before it. At six o'clock, William Russell, the presi dent, and his eighty confreres left the hotel under the impression that the remnant of the crowd would disperse also. Disperse ! Those who had retired came back with reinforcements, noisy, reckless, riotous. Vain Avas the assurance that not one of the dinner party remained in the hotel.

What harm had Dr. Priestly done to them ? He had not even been present at the obnox ious dinner !

But convinced the alarm was false, and that a late sunset had reddened the sky, he took his three mile walk into the town as usual. And yet not as usual, for as groups of colliers Avith blue cockades, hurried past him on the road, all armed with picks and crowbars, and gesticulating wildly, he quick ened his pace, only to receive melancholy confirmation as he went.

About noon Philip West came spurring down cleansed and well-paved NeAV Street, no longer a market for sAvine.

At the \"Castle\" Inn, Tamworth, his invalid wife and his daughter had procured shelter on the credit of his friend Bage the paper maker. A banker named Finch volunteered a supply of cash. On Monday morning he stood among the debris of his property in High Street, in a windowless, roofless ruin, with scarcely a vestige of furniture or woodAVork intact. Amongst a huge mass of paper, wood, coal, piled up on the ground floor for a bonfire, he discovered the old oak desk, Avith a broken"], [255, "IN OTHER HANDS. 245 lock and hinge ; but not a sign or token of the cherished MSS. or other valuables it had held. King Charles's Golden Rules were still pasted inside the lid, and he shook his head Avith a sigh as he reflected that if Peter Webb's papers had not come to light when they did they would have shared the same fate ; the fate that had fallen on his son's valuable library and book-cases, on plate and linen, Avearing apparel, household goods and relics. Relieved of an incubus the inhabitants testified their joy in illuminations. And then came the reckoning. Men of means were not to haA-e their houses burned down with impunity ; and however party feel ing might create delays, some sort of compen sation had to be made in time, though the compensation rarely represented the loss. But long before that time came William Hutton was at work rebuilding. He Avas not altogether destitute, his land-bujung had pre served him an income to fall back upon. Friends, the more fortunate Wests among the number, offered the use of their houses until his own could be restored ; the beadle of the Court showed him how, under pretence of pillage, he had stowed a chamber full of his goods ; but until order could be reduced out of chaos, William Hutton and his son slept in"], [256, "246 IN HIS OWN HAND. a house without doors, windows, or roof, or clothes to change. There was another reckoning to be made, and that was with the rioters. They were removed to Warwick for safe custody and trial. Government prosecuted, but William Hutton, and not he alone, grew savage over the palpable miscarriage of justice consequent on the obtuseness or party bias of the Birmingham jury- Three only of the ringleaders were sent to the gallowrs \u2014 Francis Field, Tommy Green, and a man named Cook ; the tAvo former con demned less for their share in the riots than for other lawless acts and violent deeds long left unpunished. They were represented as \" infernals let loose among men.\" Yet infernal as they were one woman's breast held some drops of pity for the Avorst of them. Doily Field, who had suffered so much in mind and body from the brutality of her husband, in her fervent Wesleyanism forgot everything but her early love, and her Christian duty to care for his soul. His dark utterance in front of Carew Mount had led to the conclusion that some palliation might be found even for Francis Field. He was evidently the tool of others. He had turned away from destructiveness at her bid ding and could not be wholly beyond influence."], [257, "IN OTHER HANDS. 247 Her friends obtained for her admission to the prison. And day by day she might be seen entering its dark portals to minister alike to the temporal and spiritual needs of the man who had blotted out joy from her life. At first he repulsed her fiercely, but she was no longer the sharp-tongued Dolly he had known, and the wholesome food she substi tuted for his prison diet opened the avenues of his heart before the day of trial. She could not well read to him, but she could exhort him, and pray for him with the unstudied gifts of piety, although there was no privacy for their interviews. She exhorted him, and in this she was perhaps not wholly disinterested, to clear his soul in a confession. The day after the execution the gaol chaplain handed to her a paper written and signed in a clerkly hand. Amongst much that is irrelevant it cleared up more than one mystery. He blamed his father's harshness, and the wicked prompting of his uncle Harris, for his life's misdeeds. They had led him on from bad to worse ; to pilfer from his father, forge his name, until the good man cursed the hour he had taught him to use a pen. Justice West was a terror to evil-doers ; the Harrises hated him bitterly. And when old Harris was hanged, and Ben transported, Peg took"], [258, "248 IN HIS OWN HAND. an oath to be revenged on the Justice who had condemned them to jail. Wrapped in a man's cloak she had hung about West Hall to steal away the son and heir. Once the child ran in affrighted, and hurt his hand in his haste to shut her out. The second time the lad, playing in the grounds, pitched his ball outside the gate, followed to regain his play thing, Avas snatched up, the cloak thrown over him, his mouth stopped and before he Avas missed his cap lay beside the Beck, his fine clothes were stuffed into a hollow of the Haywood Oak, and only a dirty beggar's brat lay sleeping soundly in the strong arms bearing him aAvay. She swore she would bring him to the galloAvs where her father had SAvung. And had not Dolly carried him off it might have been. He and Peg had then turned footpads, living how and Avhere they could. It Avas then she lost her eye with a cut from an old quaker's Avhip, and his arm Avas disabled by a pistol shot from Squire West Avho had come to the quaker's rescue. They Avere still disabled and in Avant when Peg came across Dolly comfortably seated behind a shop counter, Avith \" Hutton \" over the door. Peg jogged his jealous memory that Hutton had been Dolly's sweetheart, that Hutton had found them out in Charnwood,"], [259, "IN OTHER HANDS. 249 and suggested that she had fled to him. They too were marked, there was no safe following to Birmingham. When they did, there sure enough was found West's son, but no trace of Dolly. Still, there was the suspicion that William Hutton kept her somewhere hidden from his own wife's knowledge ; and the sus picion festered. He had now a personal grudge against Squire West and William Hutton both. He had never forgiven the latter his lecture on laziness in Charnwood. He con fessed how he had drained and tempted Philip as a first step to his ruin, and how when he strove to rob Hutton's shop he had fled, not from fear, but stung by the immaculate honesty of the lad no less than his appeal to him as a father. On Peg's transportation he tried hard for a better life. She and Ben had hunted him up on their return. He Avas then working honestly at the Soho mint. They again led him astray. He took to coining. Then Joe Roper crossed his path, and set him mad with a tale that William Hutton kept Dolly at Swithland, and had removed her when found out. Bad as he Avas he had loved his wife, and the raid on Hutton's place was half the outcome of his jealous frenzy. WTien he beheld her in comfort at Carew Mount he felt Iioav his jealousy had been"], [260, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 250 played upon. His conscience again smote him, and he saw the wide gulf betAveen them, saw the wrong he had done to good people through taking their fortunes into his black O O hand. But Dolly had convinced him there was another and stronger hand guiding and ruling men's lives and fortunes; exalting the hum ble, bringing pride unto the dust, shaping men's evil into good, and even through prison doors bringing penitence and hope. He should go to the gallows penitent and remorseful. This confession was a boon to the Wests. Their old opponent Oliver had contrived to keep scandal afloat. The finding of the mouldering velvet frock and underlinen, stuffed out of sight in the old oak near the source of Dover Beck set gossip and doubt at rest for ever. The confession and the clothes Avere kept together as family relics, Avith the two old knives. William Hutton read it, and bit his under lip, and when a few years later he saw his old enemy Roper in the streets of Bromsgrove, a ragged, broken-doAvn wretch who had flung fortune away and begged for pence, he remembered this confession only to obey the injunction, \"If thine enemy thirst, give him drink, if he hunger, give him food.\" Another Hand than his had avenged him."], [261, "IN OTHER HANDS. 251 Certainly he never again was heard to boast of a man's fortune being in his own hand ; no, though he survived his good wife very many years, travelled hither and thither, lived at ease, wrote volume after volume on the old desk, again set up, and died in hon our in his own mansion, worth forty thousand pounds, exclusive of the business, which had for years been surrendered to his son.
