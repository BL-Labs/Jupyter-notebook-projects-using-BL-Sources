William Hutton followed his departing visitors with his eyes up the High Town, then deliberately took down his shutters, dusted his counters, re-arranged his windows so as to exhibit fresh pages or pictures against the foot-Avide panes, and then turned to cut the edges of some book-sheets in his press ; but he did it mechanically, and as if his mind was ill at ease. He could not convince himself he was blameless either toAvards his sister or Susannah Finch. He could not hear the grumbling of old Finch that he had ' Avasted his money in dressing up Susannah to no purpose since she had not been clever enough to secure young Hutton for a mate ; ' or the characteristic advice of Mrs. Perkins to the disconsolate girl VOL. II. 18"], [14, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 2 who made no longer secret of her soitoav, \" Wait until he misses us, child : when he has to cook his own dinners, and clean his OAvn house, as well as mind his business, he will find the want of a wife.\" He did not know how Susannah sobbed herself to sleep night after night, or how ready she was to escape from her father's sneers to the house in Bear ward Lane, where she had learned to spin, and to seam stockings to earn a living independ ently of her miserly father, and where she could at least hear the fickle William spoken of without reviling. But he could miss the \"neat-handed Phillis,\" avIio had helped to set out his meals so appetizingly, and the voices that made such pleasant music by his fireside ; and still more he missed the hands that cleared aAvay sauce pans and crockery Avhen done with, and ashes from the sire-place, and dust from the furni ture where it accumulated. He felt the want of some one to market and cook for him so that he might give all his oavu time to his work or to his business. Grumbling in the ears of Mr. Grace, the latter asked, \"Why dost thee not marry? Why not make up to thy sister's young friend ? She is a comely young Avoman.\" \" I must come to an understanding with these rascally Overseers before I can think of"], [15, "THE NEW LOVE AND THE OLD. 3 a Avife ; and \u2014 a \u2014 Miss Finch is not altogether to my mind.\" \" What dost thee think of boarding with me till thee gets a wife or ' a housekeeper of thy OAvn? I shall be glad to have a sensible companion at my table.\" William snapped at the widower's offer, terms were arranged \u2014 and he congratulated himself on saving the cost of a wife or a ser- A'ant, and his OAvn time also. Orders for bookbinding came in faster than he could execute them. He Avas at work late and early. He had little leisure save on the Sunday, and besides poetical composition he found an unsuspected occupation for his soli tary hours. A stronger love than that of woman was creeping into his soul, never to be wholly dislodged. There Avas then in Birmingham no bank. Certain responsible tradesmen took charge of the spare cash of others ; but for fifteen years after William Hutton had settled in the town there AAras no definite establishment dealing solely Avith moneys and securities. Had there been, no doubt he A\\Tould have there placed his spare capital to accumulate. As it Avas, he took a special pleasure in Avatching it grow. Nightly, when all was closed in, and he alone, he counted over his gains, not merely for the day, but the sum 18\u20142"], [16, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 4 total of sterling guineas kept in his old desk, over and above the capital invested in his business ; and proud Avas he when, long before another year Avas transferred to the file of the past, he had fifty of the golden coins to mar shal before him on the table, fifty guineas overplus, to Avhich he Avas surely adding week by week. He was growing to love this glittering store over much. It Avas a feast to his sight, and he denied himself not only feasts but comforts to increase it, Avorking late and early with his OAvn hands to keep pace with orders, yet employing no help. Had this gone on the heart of the man might have been utterly giAren over to avarice. A kind Providence interposed to correct this. Either the persecution of the illogical Overseers, avIio refused the levies of a prosper ing man for fear of some future collapse, or the strain of overwork on his nerves, or his anxiety to accumulate, or an insanitary abode, or all combined brought on a serious illness. Feeling incapable of attending to his cus tomers, he closed his shop early one Thurs day evening and sought Mr. Dowler. So much Avorse Avas he by the time he reached Bull Street, that the surgeon \" blooded \" him then and there, and lent him an arm back to the GateAvay."], [17, "THE NEW LOVE AND THE OLD. 5 He Avas in a high state of fever, and the doctor not only ordered him to bed, but as sisted to get him there. Then he looked round and took a survey of the place. Fur niture there certainly was, but in a very different condition to that in Avhich it had been left by Mrs. Perkins and Susannah, and of provision for an invalid there was none. William's mind had already begun to Avander. He babbled about his gold and his old desk, and his work. The good doctor was perplexed. He had never penetrated beyond the back parlour to smoke a pipe, and had no idea Iioav the book selling bachelor lived in his den. Straightway he went to Mr. Grace, Avho stood at his shop door. \"Mr. Grace,\" said he, \"Mr. Hutton is dangerously ill. In fact, is in a fever, in my opinion not fit to be left, yet there he is alone in his house, with no one to care for him. What is to be done ? Has he no relations ? \" \" None nearer than Derby or Nottingham,\" answered the Quaker gravely. \" The drunken old sot in Derby, Avhom he calls father, would be no use if here, and I do not know where to find his good sister in Nottingham.\" \" Derby and Nottingham ! \" exclaimed the doctor, \" the man might be dead before we could communicate with friends so far away,"], [18, "6 IN HIS OWN HAND. and in my opinion buried too before a sister could get here from Nottingham ! Will you or your housekeeper go in and Avatch by his bedside Avhilst I set off to the workhouse in search of some woman to nurse him ? \" \" Certainly. I will go myself. The perse vering young man standeth high in my esteem. I am grieved to hear of his affliction.\" It Avas a good stretch to Lichfield Street, where the Avorkhouse Avas situated, the ways were dark and uneven, and being Thursday night drunken people abounded. With his stick in one hand, a horn lantern borroAved from Mr. Grace in the other, the good doctor set off on his errand through the dispersing crowd of market people. It Avas not the first time he had gone thither for a like purpose, and he was knoAvn to the officials. But the word \" fever \" created a scare. Only one woman Avas found Avillin_r to undertake the charge and risk, one the authorities Avere glad to be rid of at any rate. She did not belong to the parish, and had a braAvling tons;ur. \" She's no beauty,\" said the doctor to Mr. Grace, when in about an hour's time he Avas back with tlie Avoman Avho called herself \" Jane Smith,\" \" but she Avill be better than no one, and she professes to be a nurse. It is quite time there Avas a hospital in the toAvn Avhere"], [19, "THE NEW LOVE a4ND THE OLD. 7 nurses might be trained and found at any hour.\" \" Aye, aye,\" assented Mr. Grace, and after the doctor's instructions to the nurse, the pair Avere leaA'ing, Avhen the latter suddenly be thought him. \" I say,\" he Avhispered, \" Avhere does Mr. Hutton keep his money ? We have no voucher for Jane Smith's honesty ? \" Mr. Grace pointed to the old desk. \" Had 3'ou not better take charge of it,\" said Mr. Dowler, \" there is not much else of value to carry away, except the books.\" \" Aye, my friend, I think it might be well if I did.\" And so the desk with its contents went into safe custody next door, and the unknoAvn Jane Smith Avas left in charge, alike of the patient and the premises. For quite a fortnight William Hutton lay on his bed upstairs, only to feel in his lucid intervals that his shop Avas closed, and his business at a standstill. Then the woman Jane Smith silled him Avith fears of. he knew not what. He had been ill a Aveek before he recognized her, and then his fear took shape. The doctor and Mr. Grace seeing his repug nance, and observing Iioav attentive she Avas to the sick man, concluded that his dislike arose from the megrims of disease, and that he was"], [20, "8 IN HIS OWN HAND. raving when he called her \"Peg,\" just as he had raved of Catherine, and \" Dolly,\" and of his money. \" I do not much wonder at his dislike to Jane Smith, the woman is decidedly ill favoured, and has an ill odour of gin about her. But this is common to all sick-nurses, and the mistaken name he gives her is only a common symptom in such cases.\" The mistake Avas the doctor's. AVilliam could see and hear the woman peering and proAvling about the house ever in search of something, and naturally associated her prying with his store of gold. Then he could have told how rough she was when no friends were present, and hoAV she drank and slept the livelong night. But he was afraid of her, and when the doctor came to his bedside, tapping the lid of his ever ready snuff-box, or inhaling the essences in the pouncet-box top of his cane, he dared not express his fears or tell all he knew, for she Avas always at his elbow, as civil as a cross-grained woman could be. Nor dared he ask about his desk, lest he should mark it out to her. His fears and his anxieties retarded his recovery, and at times Dr. Dowler shook his head, very doubtful of the end. On one of these occasions, Avhen his patient was lucid but very Ioav and languid, the doctor"], [21, "THE NEW LOVE AND THE OLD. 9 after tapping his snuff-box lid twice or thrice to shake the loose powder from the hinges, and after one or tAvo liberal pinches of the mixture and as vigorous an application of his red-and-yelloAv Barcelona silk handkerchief, ventured to make a su\"G;estion loner on his mind. \" You are decidedly better to-day, Mr. Hutton, but you fluctuate very much, and you appear to have so detrimental a dislike to Jane Smith that I Avould seriously advise you to send for a relative to take her place. Although, in my opinion she hath nursed you so far satis factorily.\" William looked at him in silence. He went on. \" Then \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 perhaps it might be as AveU if you \u2014 a \u2014 made \u2014 a \u2014 Avill, supposing 37ou have not done so.\" A SAvift change SAvept across the patient's face. Had he been making money only to leave it? \" Do you \u2014 do you \u2014 think death so near, Doctor ? \" he gasped, all in a qui\\Ter. \" No, but you are feeble, the humours in the blood are \u2014 a \u2014 at present you are better \u2014 but \u2014 death is always at hand \u2014 and in my opinion eATery man Avho has anything to leave should make a will, be he ill or well.\" \"I must \u2014 think it over \u2014 Doctor. If I am \u2022no better \u2014 to-morrow perhaps,\" he articu-"], [22, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 10 lated in faint gasps. \" But I feel stronger \u2014 and if you are satisfied Avith Peg \u2014 we need not alarm or trouble \u2014 my sister Catherine. She would come \u2014 but \u2014 \" Then the doctor caught only the words \" expense \" \u2014 and \" offended.\" The proposal had given him a shock ; but the shock proved a stimulant. No will was made, no Catherine was summoned. He con tinued to amend, but he also continued to call his attendant \" Peg,\" and took neither food nor medicine from her hands without a shudder. At which the doctor gravely shook his bewigged head, and plied both snuff-box and handkerchief with perturbed frequency. A strong constitution and an abstemious life triumphed. In about ten days the doctor's \" opinion \" Avas that his patient would suffer less anxiety from a removal to the sofa downstairs, Avhere he could OA-erlook the re-opened shop Avhere his heart had been all the Avhile, and wdiere he could be consulted relative to the Avants of customers. They Avere not expected to be numerous, consider ing how long the place had been closed. He did not knoAV Iioav strong Avas William's desire to get rid of his offensive nurse. His first glance on coming downstairs went involuntarily to the corner where his desk should have been. A deadly pallor and faint-"], [23, "THE NEW LOVE AND THE OLD. 11 ness came over him. He gasped out, \" Where is my desk ? \" \" Whatn desk?\" cried the nurse. \"Are you goin' oft\" your head again ? Here, yoAv'd best lie down if yow be goin' to swoon.\" He felt as if he should. Sofa and himself seemed whirling backwards in a circle, his only consciousness being that his desk and money Avere gone. \u00b0 The Avoman thought he Avas dying. Un asked she rushed next door to say so. In came Mr. Grace in great concern. \" What is the matter, friend Hutton ; art thou Avorse ? \" \" My desk is gone \u2014 and my money ! \" Avas the answer, in a Ioav Avail. \" Nay, friend, make thy mind easy. I have thy desk in charge. Friend Dowler suggested that it would be safest in my keeping Avhilst thou had strangers about thee. Peradventure thee Avould like to haATe it back? \" \" No, no ! \" said William from his pilloAV, with a mind relieved. \" Not yet. Not whilst \" \u2014 and his Ioav voice sank to a lower AArhisper \u2014 \"not whilst Peg Harris is here.\" She was not there lon_j.

That she was the daughter of the man Harris who had been hanged in Nottingham for deer stealing and violent resistance of the keepers ; ac counting for his knowledge of the woman bj his chance rencontre under the neAAdy-erected gallows. \" I have a good memory for faces, and hers gave me a shock not to be forgotten.\" (Had he seen it then, or the threatening hand up raised behind the panelling, he Avould not have forgotten that.) He Avent on to say, \" Noav I find a number of valuable books have disappeared during my illness, and I mean to knoAV what she hath done with them.\" \" In my opinion she hath sold them for gin. I wondered hoAV she obtained it,\" put in the doctor. \" I would send the treacherous jade to the House of Correction ! \" cried the irate Quaker. \" Robbing a sick man deseiweth no lenity.\" There was no opportunity to send her any- Avhere.

He had not yet forgot ten the sale of his sister's books, if the abstracted two shillings was fading into a ghostly shadow. Nowadays a closed shop would kill a business. His speedily revived, curiosity bringing back many of his patrons. And singularly enough the loss of his black suit proved a signal service. It was needful to equip his outer man once more, and to the same Bull Street draper he betook himself with his order \u2014 not for black, but for bottle-green broad-cloth. Five of his guineas went to pay for the suit, but he still remembered that he had nearly parted with them altogether, and his renovated appearance justified the outlay. He thought he had made a capital invest ment when he discovered that Mr. Perry, his tailor and draper, had become an Overseer, and that his two suits of clothes turned the official scale in his siwour. He Avas at last, after tAvo years' controversy, admitted to pay the ordinary levies like other reputable tradesmen of the tOAvn. Now, he began to look out for an appren tice, when one he did not seek for was thrown in his Avay \u2014 and scarcely by chance. He Avas closing his shop shutters at dusk"], [26, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 14 one evening in July, when he happened to cast his eyes towards the Old Cross weather cock with a half-murmured wish that the clock face looked north, so that he could see how time sped Avithout waiting till the hours struck, when bringing his eyes doAvn to the level they rested on the figures of a woman and child seated on the low flat steps. Something- in the hopeless attitude of the woman pierced his breast as with an arroAV. Money-making was forgotten. The deserted Market Place, the hour, the season, all recalled the time when he sat there a forlorn fugitive. He almost expected to see two men in leathern aprons cross from the end of Philip Street to comfort the poor creature. Then he had an uncomfortable feeling that he had never sought out those tAvo men avIio had helped him in his sore need. Had he too literally interpreted his sister's advice to \" pick up no friends he might afterwards wish to drop ? \" He put up his last shutter, re-entered his shop, closed the half door, was about to un hook the upper half \u2014 Avhen he paused Avith his hand up, to look out.

And come to this ! \""], [28, "CHAPTER II. DOLLY'S BURDEN. What Avas there in the voice or in the faded blue eyes of the worn and bedraggled woman that recognition Avas so SAvift ? Surely but for that fortuitous meeting in Charnwood she would have been as one utterly unknown, so changed was she for the Avorse. He had seen her then in rent and untidy garments, Avith fe ay traces of the rosy-cheeked prettiness that had once held him in thrall. And now he saAV a face Avhere Avant and suffer ing and hardship had obliterated all softness, all charm. Yet the eyes spoke, and he stood aghast. She, too, looked amazed. The hand she had held out for the proffered sixpence dropped. \" Why, it's never thee ! \" she cried in a sort of shuddering wail. \" Aye, Bill Hutton, come to this !

His dress Avas homely enough, but prosperity had invested him Avith something more than good garments. He Avas self-supporting, self reliant, and held his head erect, as one whom his felloAvs respected. Once before he had been recognized as \" a gentleman,\" and the Avord Avas pleasant in his ear as then. \"Nay, Mrs. Field, he said, \"I am but a tradesman, Avorking my Avay up Avith my oavii hands.

If he dined Avith Mr. Grace he took his other meals in his own home, and had simple food at hand. The boy, who had never spoken a syllable, stared wistfuUy at the loaf the strange man set on the table, and devoured the thick bread and butter offered to him with an eagerness which spoke of long privation. There Avas the milk proA'ided for William's own supper, and at least the third of a cheese, and ' such as he had they Avere Avelcome to with right good will.' Dolly Field bore no resemblance to a Niobe. She could set her teeth and endure the in evitable, could answer abuse with taunt and invective, but either the reaction from the despair of destitution, the heartiness of the welcome accorded, or the reflection that she might have been mistress of such a home but for her own imprudence, touched some unsus pected fountain, and covering her eyes Avith her unwashed hands, she wept bitterly."], [31, "DOLLY'S BURDEN. 19 \"Don't, mammy!\" pleaded the boy; \"eat somethin', and don't cry.\" It was one of William's economics never to burn an unnecessary fire. Hence his cold supper in the warm summer months. Though every vestige of his loAre for Dolly had died out Avith his esteem, he could but pity her downcoming, and feel unnerved by her tears. \"You are overcome by fatigue,\" said he then, \" perhaps a cup of tea might refresh you. We will soon have a fire alight.\" A turf, and a feAv sticks from a faggot brought from a kitchen in the rear were speedily burning in the grate under his small copper kettle, and Avith the ease of long bachelorhood he set about providing what he called \" woman's panacea,\" now and then giving her a AATord of good cheer, for her tears made him restless and uncomfortable. There Avas a roll of distant thunder, and the rain beat sharply against the window. \" Ah,\" said he, \" when I looked up at the sky and the weathercock just now I knew that a storm was breAving.\" Her eyes Avere once more dry. With a flash of her old spirit, though without its vivacity, she burst forth, \" There are always storms brewin' somewhere, an' we mun face them as we best can.

When he returned on one occasion after an immoderate absence, William Hutton took from its nail the silver-headed cane which had been Mr. Webb's, and was in special regard, having first led the boy by the shoulder into the back room. \" Please, sir, I won't \" began Vill, with a glance of apprehension on the stout bamboo. \" You see this cane ! \" said Mr. Hutton, somewhat unnecessarily. \" It is neither so thick nor so heavy as the stick I was beaten with when I was an apprentice, and less than you, Vill \u2014 beaten until I was sore and bleeding, and there was no one to stop or hinder the overman who did it. If I were to thrash you with this cane until you could not stir, no one would or could prevent me. You are my apprentice, and if you do not work to the best of your ability I have the right either to punish you myself or send you to gaol to be beaten there. Now, which shall I do ? \" The boy, who had shared the terrors of his elders, could not hear the word \" gaol \" without"], [60, "48 IN HIS OWN H.iND. a shudder. At once he looked up, and said, unflinchingly, \" Oh, don't send me to gaol, beat me yourself, sir.\" \" No,\" said his master. \" Beating is for dogs, not for boys. I would rather treat you kindly, Vill ; but the apprentice must work, the master must be obeyed. If after this you require correction, you will have to put on your old rags and go begging again. So remember.\" \"Oh, sir,\" cried Vill, \" I'd rather you'd beat me black an' blue than that.\" \" I would rather do neither,\" was the answer, as the cane went back to its nail, having done its symbolic duty. The threat was successful. Not that Vill became a model boy all at once, but he was bright, sharp, and intelligent ; appreciated the comforts he enjoyed and the approval of his considerate master. He had, however, one great drawback as a bookseller's apprentice \u2014 he could not read. William Hutton had certainly cut out work for himself when he took charge of Vill. But always alive to his own interest, and full of pity for those to whom books were blank, he set himself to remedy the obvious deficiency as speedily as might be. The means were at hand, and Vill, who seemed to have some dim recollection of a"], [61, "THE BURDEN SHIFTED. 49 battledore and the characters upon it, soon picked up his alphabet, that first and most diffi cult step in the whole \"ladder of learning,\" picked it up not as something new, but as a something chased through the fading vista of o o o memory. Behold the lad with battledore or book before him standing by his attentive master's side, the while he adjusts the folded sheets of a book under his press, and pulls the lever that acts upon the screw. He is a slim strip of a lad with light brown curly hair, and dark clear fearless eyes, set well beneath finely arched brows, a broad fair forehead, a firmly closed mouth for a child, a nose already shap ing towards the aquiline, and in his outward array the picture of a miniature man. His fustian breeches, dark blue worsted hose, waist coat coining far below his waist, and coat of dark-grey frieze, with deep cuffs, and tails descending to his knees, even his strong shoes fastened with brass latchets in lieu of buckles, had all their representatives on full-grown forms in the streets of the town; but the features of the boy were exceptional. He was far from a dullard ; his aptitude repaid his teacher; and under the influence of judicious kindness,his best qualities of mind and body were deATeloping.

A SWEET FRIEND. The skies over Birmingham were bluer and clearer even in November in the middle of the last century than iioav at midsummer. There were no giant furnaces to belch forth smoke and obscure the heavens ; the clink of hammers might be heard, there being no ceaseless roll of vehicles and tramp of feet to deaden sound, but the forges were compara tively few and insignificant. Boulton and Watt had not yet shaken hands as a prelimin ary to shaking the world and revolutionizing manufacture. If this was true of the hard ware centre, how much truer must it have been of the open country between town and town, or of towns themselves where the water wheel was the only mechanical power ? So, although November had shown his clouded face, farmer Cox was not unmindful of his daughter's comfort, when, instead of consign ing her like a bale of goods to the carrier's waggon for uneasy con vey ance to Birmingham among boxes and baskets, which were apt to 21\u20142"], [64, "IN HIS OWN H.iND. 52 shift and poke uncomfortable corners against back, or sides, or elbows, he preferred to mount her on his own horse behind himself on a softly padded pillion with rests alike for back and feet. The roads'hadnot yet become impassable sloughs of mud and mire, the sky might be cloudy but the barometer prognostic ated fair weather, and so did Moore's Alma nac ; or if rain should fall before they reached their journey's end had she not the protection of an oilskin cape and hood. It was altogether better and more seemly that the father himself should consign his dainty darling of a daughter to her uncle's care, and if the thrifty farmer had not found a more convenient season for the fulfilment of his promise, it was because he had not hither to seen a chance of utilizing his journey to his own profit. He had samples with him now of corn to sell. Francis Grace had been duly apprised of her coming, preparations had been made for her reception, and of course William Hutton was prepared for her arrival. On Thursday, the very busiest day in the Aveek, being market-day, farmer Cox piloted his horse through the crowded Beast Market \u2014 where the cattle stood in rows, flank to Hank, with their horned heads resting on the elevated footways \u2014 to his brother's door abou t"], [65, "A SWEET FRIEND. 53 eleven in the morning, when the stalls and shambles were all set in order and business was at its briskest. At that very moment William Hutton was standing on his own steps looking out, an ox having broken from a drove and careering down the Bull Ring, past the Old Cross chased by the herdsman, swerved aside from the shambles and was making havoc among the Staffordshire crockery on the pavement near the Corn Cheaping. Of course there was an uproar, and although farmer Cox's steed had carried double over thirty-six miles that morning, the general stampede, the rushing and shout ing disturbed the nerves of the orderly animal, and he was on the point of bolting likewise. A man caught it by the bridle and William darted forward to lift the young lady from her no longer easy pillion. Goodness ! how light was her weight ! How small and child-like the hooded figure that stood for a moment beside him ! How sweet was the voice which said, \" I thank thee, friend,\" ere she turned to salute the uncle who awaited her in his own doorway. William Hutton went back to his business recalling the day when the same sweet voice had thanked him for the preservation of her best hat ; well pleased to reflect that the change in himself set recognition at defiance."], [66, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 54 He had not attained that height at which it became pleasant to look back on his disreput able tramp. At noon, when he went as usual to dine at the stockinger's, leaving Vill (whose dinner came afterwards) to take charge of his shop, and if necessary to run and say he was \"wanted,\" there was a formal introduc tion to farmer Cox, and Sarah Cox likewise, and then William's surprise was intensified, so small and fairy-like was the golden-haired maiden who acknowledged his salutation with so sedate a courtesy. Never had he seen so perfect a combination of the child and the woman. In figure the former, in manner and bearing the latter. But a tradesman's dinner on market-day was a hasty affair even in slow-going times, and William had little leisure for observation then. Ample were his opportunities afterwards. He was first struck with the gradual change she wrought in her uncle's household : the precision and orderliness with which every thing was managed ; the neatness and scrupu lous cleanliness of rooms and table, the whiteness of the napery, the polish on knives and silver spoons, and then contrasted all with his own disorderly bachelor home not too complacently. Along with the chest"], [67, "A SWEET FRIEND. 55 containing the dainty young lady's wardrobe the carrier had conveyed a spinning-wheel, and if by chance William popped in after business hours he was almost sure to find Sarah Cox seated at her buzzing wheel. At such times his thoughts were apt to wander to his sister Catherine, with whom he had not had much communication since she left him in displeasure, and as a matter of course to Susannah also. And doing so was not with any compunctious visiting, but with mental congratulations that he had for once resisted the imperative will of his sister and not succumbed to the too apparent infatuation of simple-minded Miss Finch. AVhy he re joiced he did not think to ask himself. It could not be in consequence of any attraction exhibited by Miss Cox towards himself. Indeed, there were times when he was convinced that she positively disliked him. Not that she said it in so many words, but because she said no more to him than common civility demanded, and seemed rather to hold aloof than accept the slightest attention. So different had been the girls with whom he had come in contact, not alone Dolly Parker and Susannah Finch, but young ladies who came to change books at his library and stood to chat over his counter, that his personal"], [68, "56 IN HIS OWN HAND. vanity was piqued. If she did enter into conversation it was always when her uncle was present ; then her remarks were clear and pertinent, and marked by none of the giggling affectation or frivolity shown by some of his feminine subscribers. It was somewhat mortifying to find that the most sensible young lady of his acquaint ance took the least notice of him. Nay, even little Vill, who, also by arrangement, dined in the kitchen of Mr. Grace with his apprentices when the master's meal was over, seemed more in favour than himself. Detecting the boy in a falsehood to screen a fault, she had taken him to task, and dis covering how lamentably his morals had been neglected, and that of religious training he had none, out of very pity she undertook to disperse his darkness ; and was so gentle in her teaching that Vill listened in reverence, and lost his heart to her completely. The delicate purity of her features and complexion, the sweetness of her voice, the neatness of her attire impressed him the more in contra distinction to the high tones, rough manners, and general slatternliness of the only women he had known as his \" mammy \" and \" aunt,\" to say nothing of the repulsiveness and brutality of the latter, Peg. The query, \" Why have you been so long"], [69, "A SWEET FRIEND. 57 over dinner ? \" had one day elicited the reply, \"Pretty Aliss Cox was talking to me, sir. I could not come away.\" \" H'm ! I wish she would talk to me,\" was the 'mental ejaculation. Aloud, \" Ah, and pray what was she talking about ? \" \" She was teaching me the ten command ments, sir. She taught me ' Our Father ' last week, and made me promise to say it every night.\" \" And have you done so, Vill ? \" \"Oh, aye, sir. You know, I must keep my word.\" \"To sure, Vill. I hope you are grateful to Miss Cox for the pains she takes with you. You ma}r think yourself fortunate.\" \" Aye, sir, and I love her, oh, so much, she is so kind.\" \" I wish I found her so ! \" thought the boy's master. \" I am surely worthy as much attention as this 'prentice lad. But women's whims are neither to be gauged nor counted.\" We need scarcely say that William Hutton stood on pretty good terms with himself. His rapid rise had impressed him so much with the improvement in his oavii manner and personal appearance, that the man of thirty, contrasting himself with himself at eighteen or twenty, expected those with whom he came into contact to be equally impressed Avith his"], [70, "58 IN HIS OWN HaAND. good looks, his learning, his poetry, his agreeable flow of language, and his position as a tradesman. Men of erudition and intelligence frequented his library \u2014 Baskerville and Dr. Ash among the number \u2014 and conversed Avith him on equal terms ; Dr. DoAvler and William Ryland were friendly and intimate, so Avas Francis Grace. He could not comprehend AAdiy the Quaker's dapper niece should keep him at such a dis tance. At last it occurred to him that from her rigidly correct friends in Derby, she had heard of his early escapade, and been warned to set a mark of aA*oidance against his name. The very idea tended to make him awkward and abashed before her, and to widen the dis tance betAveen them as Aveeks and months went by. Dissatisfied Avith this state of things and with the state of his oavii dwelling, which called for something more than the cleaning down it got from Mrs. Field on her fitful visits, or the tidying up at the unskilled hands of his young apprentice, he resolved once more to venture on a housekeeper, one who might be able to take, charge of his shop in case business called him forth. At all events, a cook in his oavii kitchen Avould obviate the necessity of meals at a"], [71, "A SWEET FRIEND. 59 neighbour's, save time if not money, and relieve Miss Cox of the presence of one she evidently found distasteful. He had already opened a branch establish ment in Bronisgrove, and bought a horse on which he could travel to and fro for the Tuesday's market, Avhen his business proper Avas generally slack ; and the hiring of some one to supplement his very young apprentice Avas a necessity, apart from any desire to 1)3 independent of his neighbours.

Young Vill was the gainer if Mr. Hutton was not. He Avas relieved from much of the drudgery about the house, to which he had an inborn antipathy, and Avas not alloAved to forget the lessons of Miss Cox.

That is a blessed young lady next door ; I must water the good seed she has soAvn.\" No doubt a gamesome boy would rather have run out into the fields, but Vill had ever a fear upon him of meeting his cruel father in the country lanes and meadows \u2014 a fear deepened by Dolly Field Avhenever she came to recruit her stock. A year or more had gone by since she had taken to book-hawking, Avhen she came back one day with her empty basket and told Mr. Hutton she Avas weary of wandering, for she went about the country in deadly fear of meeting Avith either her husband or Peg Harris. \" More than once I hae come across th' track o' a woman wi' a hare-lip and cross eyes, dressed hauls like a mon in a josey and a slouch hat, an' I knew Avell it warr shu, an' that Field warr not far away.

There you might carry on your lace trade in addition, and keep the place open all the week.\" Dolly, iioav in her thirtieth year, had con trived to clothe herself decently for her call ing, but few traces of her early prettiness remained. She Avas commended to the care of Patience Jolly as the mother of Vill, but though she Avas loud in her praise of Mr. Hutton, and bade Vill honour and respect him, setting him forth as a bright exemplar, she dropped no hint of their former relations, or of her oavii mistaken boldness in early life, but left Patience in the belief that only the natural beneArolence of the man prompted her master's kindness to Mrs. Field and her boy, and evoked the poor Avoman's grati tude. Mr. Hutton himself must have held some thing of the same opinion of his own motives Avhen he talked OA'er his intention to Mr. Grace,"], [74, "62 IN HIS OWN HAND. and (after he had seen her off by the carrier's waggon, along AArith a parcel of goods which thereby went as luggage) acquainted his friends, Dr. Dowler and William Ryland, Avith what he had done \"for the poor mother of his apprentice.\" But he rubbed his hands together, with the satisfactory feeling that in serving Dolly Field he Avas also serving himself. His shop Avhen open for six days would surely return more than when only open one, the rent Avould be the same, and Dolly's payment come out of extra profits. SomehoAV, after this, he thought Miss Cox looked differently on him, that her shyness and reserve was melting. He no longer Avorked or studied incessantly. When busi ness Avas over he sometimes took a stroll about the town, Avith Vill by the hand, to make the lad acquainted with the thorough fares, as Avell as for exercise, giving him many a useful lesson by the way. Or he stepped into his neighbour's back parlour for a little trade or political gossip, sure to find Miss Cox either at her Avheel or a Avonderful patchwork quilt she was contriving out of Indian chintz ; the latter, a sort of applique, where flowers cut from the original chintz were rearranged and sewed with a fancy stitch on stout Avhite dimity, or dimothy as it was then called."], [75, "A SWEET FRIEND. 63 Either AAdieel or quilt AA'as certain to intro duce some remark about his sister Catherine, to Avhich the golden-haired Avorker Avas willing to listen or respond, and sometimes she took the initiative with questions anent the pro gress of Vill, but all with so little self-con sciousness, and such maidenly sedateness, as filled him Avith new ideas of Avomankind and set the extinguished cinder in his breast all agloAv again. Francis Grace Avas at any hour ready to Avelcome his familiar neighbour, who could enter into all the details of the stocking trade grievances and difficulties, and whose personal rivalry he had no occasion to dread ; and if William dropped in at the \" Golden Stocking \" more frequently as the year rounded, he had no suspicion that that or any other golden stocking was in danger of a raid upon it."], [76, "CHAPTER V.

But not merely to feast his eyes as formerly ; a new element had come into his life : he watched the increase as a means, not an end.

William put up his shutters, an apprentice came out to close those of Air. Grace. The hosier himself had not returned. The golden head of Sarah Cox, or as much as her close cambric cap did not hide, Avas visible at the door, looking anxiously down the almost deserted Bull Ring. AVilliam, anxious too, alike on account of his friend and of his horse, spoke to her and expressed a \" hope that her uncle Avould be home ere night closed in.\" The doors of the two shops adjoined. He stood upon his OAvn steps leaning against the jamb ; she, neatly and quaintly attired in gray calimanco, Avith elboAv ruffles and kerchief of delicate laAvn, stood out upon the next, evi dently in great perturbation. Never before had she appeared so willing to converse. Her fears made her feel the need of a companion ; and if the conversation seemed at all likely to flag she was ready to reneAV it, though the topic was still the same \u2014 the danger of the roads. \" I understand thou hast been a great traveller, sir,\" she advanced during one of these breaks. \" Not a very great traveller, madam, yet it hath fallen to my lot to journey between Not tingham and this town tAvice or thrice, and likewise to London and back, also on foot. vol. 11. 22"], [78, "66 IN HIS OWN HAND.

There in my melan choly I chanced to wander by a meandering brook, and overtook a fair little damsel swinging a straAv hat by the strings as she tripped along. The wind Avas rude and tore away the pretty maiden's hat. It was my good hap to restore it.

There Avas nothing unusual about the table or the room even to AVilliani Hutton, but somehoAv, as his eye took in all the details at a glance, the precision and cheeriness struck him as never before. He Avas struck too with the self-command of the niece Avho, repressing her own curiosity and anxiety, insisted that her good uncle should sup before he entered on an exciting topic. \" Whatever hath happened, Uncle Grace, thou art noAV safe.

The hosier had a small but long-standing debt owing to him at Aloseley. He desired to obtain it if possible, but did not care to venture out so far alone during the short dark days of February.

He had rid himself of Bromsgrove and its associations ; Dolly Field had disappeared too in the very nick of time, he did not bestir himself to inquire whither.

He Avanted no old sweethearts there to trouble his \" dear loAre \" with even the shadoAv of a doubt ; as for Susannah Finch she Avas too far aAvay to trouble any one, and doubtless she had consoled herself as readily as had Miss Tilt.

Yet she did not dream away the hours, or sit down to a spinnet to warble sentimental loA'e ditties.

Francis Grace led the way to the front of the house which overlooked a quaint and trimly bordered garden with an approach from the village ; an approach the more necessary since John Cox, like his father be fore him, combined shop-keeping with farm ing, though there were no outward indica tions of the trade, carried on as it was in a room on the left of the porch, having an open door immediately beyond the threshold."], [119, "MA TRIMONI.ILLY INCLINED. 107 In this porch, overgrown with ivy, they Avere met and welcomed cordially by a russet cheeked dame in a plain full-skirted gown of broAvn linsey, protected from smear or soil by a homespun apron long and Avide, the flax for Avhich had been grown and dressed and spun upon the farm, and Avhich Avas almost as snowy as the closely-fitting unfrilled cap upon her head or the lawn kerchief coATering neatly neck and bust. \" Thou art Avelcome, brother Francis, and thy friend likewise,\" and she extended her broAvn hand with quiet dignity to each in turn. \" AValk into the house and pray be seated.

I Avas not likely to ride so far either for a Avife or for waste paper.\" The old man's countenance had fallen ; Susannah, too, looked doAvncast. AVilliani, turning over the odds and ends, notes, memo randa, and printed matter, turned over another idea in his mind to bear fruit in a future day, \" Why should not I, too, become ' a worthy historian?'

When the bargain was struck the embyro historian had secured a heap of crude but valuable material, and Air. Finch had obtained shillings for what had cost him pence, and had been unsaleable. If he had not disposed of his daughter he had at least made a profitable sale, and that Avas next best. Indeed it made him bold to suggest that OO Susannah Avould make an excellent Avife, and that he thought she and William were made for each other. It Avas a sad disappointment to Air. Finch to hear from Air. Hutton's own lips that his choice had fallen elseAAdiere, and that he had left his business solely to arrange about the marriage portion of the young lady. This Avas the death-blow to Susannah's hopes and to her father's schemes.

Nevertheless marriage did not follow imme diately. He had not quite reconciled his mind to the acceptance of only one hundred pounds, although every day made the self contained maiden more dear to him, and every day taught him how much a Avife Avas needed at the head of his small household. Patience tried his patience exceedingly. She Avas not exactly inert, but she was forgetful. Her mind seemed always Avander ing in a mist or labyrinth of speculation, and with the best intentions in the Avorld, she made the most provoking blunders, left un done the most commonplace and palpable duties. She justified her name in the meek ness and submission Avith which she took rebuke, but that did not make her negligence less irritating. AVhen on the Tuesday afternoon our two travellers left their horses at the \" Garland,\" and Air.

Vill, Avhose education was carried on in a very desultory manner, had squared his elbows, set his head on one side, and Avith his fingers gathered together in a heap over his pencil, begun to set down the message in large unshapely characters which offended the eye of the once-upon-a-time stone-cutter and waiting master. \" Stay, my boy,\" interrupted he, \" that is not the Avay to hold your pencil.

Hutton, as he came in unaAvares and took in the scene at a glance. \"I hope I see you well. You have done my 'prentice honour. I hope he Avill profit by your gracious instructions.\" \" Pooh ! pooh ! that is a small matter. It is a pity so Avell-mannered and intelligent a lad should not be able to write a fair hand.

AVhere is the par cel?\" to Vill. \"If you please, master,\" began Vill, \"Ave could not sind it. Patience thought you must \" It was the old story.

A ring fence enclosed O o O the whole, giving both importance and exclu siveness. A double flight of steps protected by an or namental hand-rail led to the front entrance. On the broad topmost flag Vill waited with his parcel until the door Avas opened.

The staircase A\\Tas a marvel of archi tectural art. The iron balustrades had been exquisitely wrought from Air. Baskerville's own choice designs. There Avere lamps swing ing up aloft from gilded chains, or resting on carved brackets ; and niches holding statues on which Vill gazed Avith awe. In the library to which he Avas shown he beheld like evidence of opulence and art in the carved mantle-pieces, the no\\Tel firegrates, the carved bookcases and furniture, the lacquered and japanned cabinets, the painted panels. The master of it all Avas scarcely seen in the boy's marvelling admiration of his surround ings. Yet there he stood by a table with some papers in his hand, and for a moment Avatched Vill's deep-set eyes roving everywhere to settle at last on some elaborately-carATed woodAvork. \"Do you admire that?\" asked Alr.Baskerville. \"It is beautiful!\" said the boy rapturously. It was like a revelation to him. \" Here,\" said the Avell-pleased gentleman, \" are some writing copies. Take them with you for imitation. Let me see you have im proved when I am in town again.\" He Avas thanked, and the boy departed, full of the wronders he had seen, but unable to give expression to all he thought. \" I wish I had a knife,\" said he, \" I Avould try to carve things like those.\""], [146, "AV HIS OWN HAND. 134 \" You would only cut your fingers,\" objected Patience. \" Better copy that beautiful writing, it Avill be more use to you.\" The writing was done over and over with varying success, and his assiduity was com mended. But the desire to imitate the carved devices he had seen never left him. He saA7ed his few pence, bought a knife, and made the attempt on sticks from the firewood faggots. Of course he made a litter of chips on the kitchen hearth, but Patience swept them up Avith never a grumble. Her master was beginning to grumble at her. He now drank coffee, and she spoiled the coffee in the roasting. Aleals Avere never punctual She, however, capped all one day Avdien dinner time came, and it was apparent that although the vegetables Avere boiling in O O O the pot, the beef that should have been boiled with them had been left uncooked in the larder.

However actiATe and willing Arill might be, o o * and hoAvever forgetful Patience might have o o been, there Avere numberless little matters calling for feminine attention, or left undone for Avant of a feminine hand. Vill had already shown some dexterity in the use of his pocket knife on wood, held his pen or pencil Avith better result, could handle a needle to stitch folded sheets of paper for binding, but to darn a stocking or repair a rent respectably was beyond the skill of either apprentice or master, and for household drudgery the former had a sort of instinctive abhorrence. He almost rose into open rebellion against the use of a mop and pail or a scrubbing-brush, and made such a mess of his garments with his enforced housewifery, that William soon saw the false economy of setting him to the uncongenial work. He had ahvays been willing to fetch and carry for Patience, to relieve her from any burden his oavii strength would support, to bear the brunt of her shortcomings, but his"], [148, "136 IN HIS OWN HAND. repugnance to help her in anything destructive of personal neatness and cleanliness Avas not to be overcome. This fastidious regard for his appearance Avhich had grown upon him of late made him a more desirable assistant behind the counter but a very bad substitute for a servant in the house. Then, the dining out, if it saved the cost and trouble of a fire, had its disadvantages. As business steadily increased, the presence of a competent attend ant became the more urgent. The bookseller had to hurry 0ATer his meals, or to leave them unfinished, being liable to a sudden call from Vill, avIio had to cptit his post to summon him. He Avas not quite sure he had done wisely in dismissing Patience. One sultry day in June a testy old gentle man, indignant at finding only a little 'prentice lad behind the counter, and too impatient to wait until Air. Hutton could be called, marched off straightway to the shop of Air. Aris. He Avas a Avell-knoAvn customer, avIio spent his money freely, and his defection meant both loss and annoyance to the thrifty shop keeper. It dwelt in his mind, and Avhen, in the course of the afternoon Dr. Dowler Avalked in for a chat over the counter, he could not forbear telling his vexation. The doctor listened, tapped his silver snuff-"], [149, "ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT. 137 box, took a long pinch, and Avhen Mr. Hutton paused nodded his head and remarked, \" In my opinion, Air. Hutton, you Avant a Avife. Some one to make your house a home, and to be on the spot Avith authority in your absence. A housekeeper is a sorry substitute, she hath her own interests to serve. A wife's interest is identical Avith your owrn. You should marry. That is my opinion, and you can have it without a fee.\" In came Air. Ryland, took off his three cornered hat to the doctor, shook hands with his friend, and whilst he dipped his finger and thumb in the proffered snuff-box asked \" What's the latest news ? \" \" Dr. DoAvler hath been prescribing a Avife to keep impatient customers in good humour during my absence,\" quoth William Hutton with a smile. \" Very sensible of Dr. DoAvler,\" was Air. Ryland's observation. \" I met your 'prentice Vill just nou with a hole in his stocking the size of a penny, a vest minus half its comple ment of buttons, and I thought, doctor, if our friend's apparel was in like condition he would not much longer remain a bachelor.

I recommend your prescription strongly.\""], [150, "138 AV HIS OWN H.4ND. That night William Hutton took his guineas out of his desk again, thoughtfully, and counted them over once more. Considerable additions had been made to the two hundred. He Avent to bed to toss about and think. He Avas realizing the loss he sustained from neglect, the Avaste of his own time and Vill's in unprofitable occupations, and the absolute loss of a good customer for lack of a sufficient deputy ; to say nothing of personal discomfort. The doctor and William Ryland had given a fillip to his slumbering intent. AVhy, the very papers he had brought from Nottingham remained untouched in his saddle bags for lack of opportunity to inspect them. The evenings he spent at the \" Golden Stock ing \" would be spent on his own hearth if his dear love sat there. He Avent to sleep Avith Dr. Dowler's \" opinion \" floating through his mind. He Avakened suddenly in the morning betAveen six and seven to be greeted with the twittering of a pair of sparroAvs that had built a nest under the eaves. \"The birds mate and trust in providence for support,\" ruminated he, \" Avhy should I remain single ? What am I waiting for ? We love each other. My trade increases. There is no dread of poverty. There is no reason for delay, nothing to expect or gain by it."], [151, "ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT, 139 AVhat must be done soon may as Avell be done now.

It wanted yet a quarter to seven when he took Aliss Cox by surprise with the sudden announcement, \" Sally, my dear, we have been too long apart. I desire to be married to-day.\" \" To-day, William ! Oh, that is too sudden ; I am not prepared. I have no Avedding garments. What Avould my uncle say?\" \"I am going to marry you, not your gOAvn, Whatever dress you lAvear is delightful unto me,\" and he emphasized the compliment Avith a clasp and a kiss, which brought a blush to Sarah's cheek. As the clock struck seven down came the old gentleman for his breakfast. He opened his eyes on finding William there so early. \" Mr. Grace, this is to be our wedding-day.\" \" AVilliam Hutton, thou art dreaming ! Hast thou bidden the guests ? Hast bought the licence or the ring? Hast thou set thy house in order ? \" \" I have bidden Sally and yourself.

The facilities for sudden marriages Avere great. William startled his friend Air. Ryland at his breakfast. The two Avere speedily off together to procure a licence and arrange for the ceremony at St. Phillip's church. A ring Avas bought on their way to Dr. DoAvler's, and before midday that sunny twenty-third of June, 1755, Francis Grace and AVilliani Ryland had signed their names as witnesses of the marriage of AVilliam Hutton and Sarah Cox \u2014 a marriage AA'ithout any pomp of bridesmaids or bridal robes, carriages or Avedding favours, and with only an impromptu feast at the \"Golden Stocking,\" where Airs. Ryland kept the bride in coun tenance, to celebrate the event."], [153, "CHAPTER X. IN the two homes. AIr. Ryland had been quite right in saA'ing that the delicate little lady would play the good fairy in AVilliam Hutton's abode. With out any honeymoon trip, Avithout any dismay at the disorder confronting her on her bride groom's hearth, without any waste of time for dalliance she took in hand the practical duties of wifehood, and brought sunshine literally into shady places. As the wedding had been unpremeditated twelve hours in adATance so no preparation had been made for her reception. And as there had been no woman-servant on the premises for more than a month, it may be supposed that the prospect before her was disheartening. It may haATe been. At any rate she did not make a fuss about it. Her farmhouse train ing served her in good stead ; she was not afraid or ashamed of any household work.

On first taking her home William had apologized for the general aspect, on the score that he Avas a bookseller not a house maid, and having married precipitately at last had no chance of making special prepara tions. And he had offered to recall Patience as an assistant in putting the house in order, remarking, \" I know the litter and untidiness Avill be an eyesore to you,as it hath been to me.\" It was an eyesore to her, though little Vill had been doing his unskilled best all the evening to put things in condition for her coming. But the composed little woman had a spirit of her OAvn, and was resolved to prove herself equal to the redoubtable Airs. Perkins, of whom she had heard so much. \" Thank thee, AVilliani, for thy considera tion, but I can do all that is needful Avithout assistance. I can then be sure it is done thoroughly and to my own mind. Would thy sister Catherine desire an assistant ? \" \" No, mappen not. But Catherine is taller and stronger,\" and he passed an arm around her slight form as if she needed support."], [155, "AV THE TWO HOMES. 143 \" So Avas Goliath taller and stronger than David,\" was her prompt rejoinder. Then in another tone she added, \" Didst thou not take thy Avife as a helpmate. I should scarcely be that if I added to thy expenses the cost of a handmaid as well as a wife.

The morning light revealed all that the o o obscurity of candlelight had left doubtful. She had a task before her. Not, perhaps, so gieat as might have been had William Hutton himself been careless and disorderly. He Avas neat and orderly in his habits, but he had never, even in his apprenticeship, been trained to woman's work, and uoav his business claimed all his time and his attention.

It Avas woman's work and therefore not more unseemly than to cook her husband's dinner. His mother had done such work, so had his aunt Ann, and his sister Catherine. He only looked on Avith the proud thought that Catherine could not have done better, always ready Avith a hand to lift or pull any article too heavy for Sarah's strength. Strangely enough, Vill, avIio had resented manfully all attempts of Patience to enlist his services, was foremost to proffer them to his new mistress. \" Let me do this,\" \" Let me do that,\" \" I can clean windows,\" \" I can rub furniture ; \" there Avas nothing he could not or would not have done to help her, as if he had an intuitive perception she was too delicate for the work she had undertaken, and that it was his duty to relieve her.

It needed not her commenda- tion \" Thee's a handy little lad,\" to make him her willing bond slave. By the end of another Aveek the house had quite another aspect. It felt differently. The atmosphere Avas no longer loaded with impal- pable atoms of that destructive element called dust, and if there Avas a sensation of beeswax about, that was not uirwholesome. Sarah had laid her husband's money-bag under contribu- tion for household requisites. Patience had meekly dispensed with them rather than say \" she could not work without tools,\" and he in his admiration and iicav happiness had opened it freely.

Chintz superseded the check curtains and sofa-cover, there was a larger square of quiet carpet laid upon the floor, the corner cup- board Avas supplied with china and glass, of Avhich there had formerly been a dearth, and the high mantel-shelf received a few adorn ments in the way of japanned-Avare and Derbyshire spar, for use as Avell as ornament. vol. 11. 27"], [158, "146 AV HIS OWN HAND.

And, as no wedding garments had dignified the hasty ceremony, the omission had to be repaired afterwards, even Vill being treated to a new and better suit, as well as his master. Tommy Green, Avho, Avhen he Avorked at all, still worked for Mr. Perry, was again deputed to carry home the clothes.

Of that goodness Vill had never a doubt, for meeting as he did Avith other 'prentice lads out of doors, he heard tales of ill-usage and semi-starA~ation that took away his breath, and made the kindness and gentle ness of his own master the greater from the contrast. Even the apprentices of Francis Grace derided the assertion that Air. Hutton \" never larruped \" him, for they had felt the Aveight of the Quaker's admonitory stick. Then the kicks and blows of his hard father Field were unforgotten, and the boy regarded Air. Hutton with the affection and ATeneration of a son.

Her Aunt Ann made capital of her exclusion, and of the obstinate folly which deputed to an inexperienced lass and to an ignorant booby ofa brother the delicate duty of the sick-nurse, when she Avas ready to Avait upon her niece night or day. But Airs. Perkins would have none of her. She had more faith in the heart and hand service of Susannah, and Avas sure, whilst lying on her painful couch upstairs, that all Avas well beloAv.

In Susannah she had perfect confidence, and the trust was well deserved and repaid. Whether she loved Airs. Perkins for the sake of her distant brother or for her own the effect Avas the same. She came and went, not altogether Avith the light and elastic step as of old, but, Avithout neglecting her father's com fort, there she wTas to administer medicine, prepare food, make Catherine's bed, clear her room, or ease a pilloAv.

Punctually and efficiently Avere those orders carried out, but life trembled in the balance. and there came an hour when eA~en she sur rendered hope and her own will.

Much to the amazement of Dr. Davison, Avhose interest in the extraordinary case attracted him thither as a friend, despite his abrupt dismissal, that night proved the crisis. Five Aveeks later Thomas had the pleasure of handing her into a sedan-chair for an airing, the blinds being drawn down to protect her weak eyes from the glare of the summer sun. For some days after that she lay reclining on the settle in the house-place, or sat in the cornered-chair by the open casement to inhale the breath of her garden flowers, whilst Susannah came and went, adjusting her pillows, shading the light, or preparing their simple meals as if she had been a younger and most loving sister. Then when she Avas fairly on her feet again did Thomas hand her back the remnant of her hard-earned savings, to be replaced by her in the small inner box of the great coffer.

Some hazy project of the kind had floated through Hutton's mind years before in conversation with his sister, but here was a tangible offer made to him of a large stock of paper Avliich he might either sell upon commission, or pur chase upon credit. He thought it over, \" Nay, nay,\" said he, \" I'll have no dealings on commission, and I'll not run in debt. I can spare a couple of hundred guineas, and as far as they Avill go, I'm open to deal. But you must bring your prices down for cash.\" Then folloAved calculation, and deliberation over samples, sizes, and prices until finally Air. Hutton hurried off home round the corner to take counsel AAith his Avife, and if she approved return Avith the money. He found her with one foot on the rocker of the wooden cradle Avhere slept her babe, her busy fingers fashioning a tiny frock, and she ready to listen and assent. He still kept his cash in the old oak desk. Unlocking it, as it stood in the corner on its shelf, he opened a bag containing his hoard of gold, and in his haste to count the two hun dred out, dropped tAvo or three of the guineas on the bottom of the desk.

It had slipped to the front with the shaking. \" Ah ! \" cried he, \" I'll soon dislodge it,\" and opening the picker, Avhich turned stiffly on its hinge, and doubled the length of the knife, he raked the space Avith the bent rod, and brought forth a long paper packet, yelloAving with years, and his guinea also. Botk ends of the packet were sealed. It was endorsed in the handwriting of his Uncle George, \"Papers belonging to Air.

He had put the knife out of his hand on the table behind the desk and left it there. The displaced desk offended Airs. Hutton's sense of order. She rose to replace it, saw the knife and took it up. \" This is a singular knife, and seemeth of value. AVilliam hath surely left it out by mistake.\" She closed the picker and saying, \" I will put thee away here for safety,\" placed it within one of the two small uncarved drawers, Avhich at some remote period must have been added as wings, and lifted the heavy desk back to its shelf in the corner.

So in the excitement and hurry of clearing and shelving a room for the reception of his new stock, arranging it and advertising the \" Paper AVarehouse \" duly, AViUiam Hutton scarcely gave a second thought to the papers he had dragged to the light, and thrust back into darkness to await his attention at that \" more convenient season,\" Avliich never came.

So did Dr. Deering's odd pamphlets and loose manuscript notes lie undisturbed in the unused saddle-bag, but they involved no interests but his own, and might bide their time. It is a decided advantage to be the first to introduce any commodity. AVilliam Hutton was the first bookseller in SoutliAvell, the first and only paper merchant in Birmingham. And, to say nothing of printers, the demand for paper in a town producing numberless fancy articles requiring careful package must have been great. He began to feel the need of extra assistance.

Still the AATork pressed heavily on all, and William was contemplating the taking of a new apprentice or an assistant, Avhen a greater change came about, a change that was at once O ' o a loss and a gain. His wife lost a good uncle and he a tried friend by the death of hasty but good-hearted Francis Grace, whom they mourned sincerely, though they gained by his death not merely tAvo hundred pounds to supplement Sally's original and undervalued one hundred, with a supply of plate and linen, but the power to add the hosier's premises to their oavii. The \" Golden Stocking \" sign Avas taken O O down. The family was transferred to the Gate way, whilst the Avhole of the old premises Avas absorbed by his flourishing book and paper trade, and became indeed the \" Paper Ware house,\" as his sign imported. Then, too, Catherine Perkins, avIio had erected a home for her brothers and self, was called upon to surrender steady-going Thomas vol. ii. 28"], [174, "162 IN HIS OWN HAND. to help forward the fortune of his elder brother, and perchance secure his own. Did she pause or falter at the new pro position? Did she hesitate, remembering Iioav lonely she would be if illness again overtook her ? No. Her religion was pure and prac tical ; she never stopped to palter Avith principle or duty. AVeek by Aveek she stood in the open Market Place displaying her drapery goods on a stall with a sort of moveable penthouse covering, not merely advising her customers, but dictating Avhat they should buy, influ enced no doubt by a desire to sell that wliich Avas suitable and serviceable rather than the merely fanciful and useless. And, the buyers being mostly of the poorer class, it was her wont not merely to fix an arbitrary price from which there was no departure, but to adjust the payment by instalments according to some standard of her oavii, so as to press lightest on those Avhose means were smallest. She was a stickler for punctuality of payment, though never hard on an honest debtor ; and stood there behind her stall as proudly independent as a peeress in her own right. She served many, OAved nothing, oppressed no one. That she was respected goes without telling ; for though her decisive manner might be marked by eccentricity, her upright-"], [175, "HOW TIME FLIES. 163 ness, firmness, and promptness commanded esteem. Hers was a high standard of duty ; she did not live for herself alone. So there was neither grumble nor sign of dissatisfaction when AVilliam offered his brother a home and a respectable salary as his assistant ; she rejoiced openly at the brightening prospects of both brothers, congratulated the book lover on finding congenial employment, but said little or nothing of the loneliness of her OAvn future. As she had done for the other so did she for Thomas ; advancing the money for an out fit becoming to his neAv station (in order that he should neither compromise his brother nor himself by his appearance), adding thereto cash for his journey by carrier \u2014 and some thing over. She had already turned the old frame-room into a ware-room or shop for her drapery, Avhere custom came to her, although not in the heart of the town ; and so, maybe her solitude Avas broken up by the very coming and going of those she served. Then she was strict in her religious observances, was rapidly draAving Susannah Finch into the same groo\\*e, and so AA~as not wholly com panionless. Nay, when some eighteen months later old 28\u20142"], [176, "AY HIS OWN HAND. 164 Air.

The same year that carried off the old bookseller closed over the graATe of the elder William Hutton, in the churchyard of All Saints', Derby, and for a brief and saddened day brought together sister and brothers. They had at least the satisfaction of knoAving that his shortcomings and his sorrows were alike over, and however he had failed in his duty as a father towards them, they had done Avhat they could to smoothe the later years of his life, William in particular having raised him from the depths of poverty to such respecta bility as his habits would admit.

But even in the cup of bliss there are dregs. The loving though undemonstrative little wife, OO ~ of whom he was at once so fond and proud, was beginning to droop, although she was the last to admit her OAvn delicacy. AVhether in her desire to prove a Avorthy helpmate ,to her husband, and to leave him no cause to insti tute unfavourable comparisons betAveen his wife and his redoubtable sister, she had over taxed her own strength, or in her extreme deA'otion to her children she had sacrificed herself on the altar of maternity, the effect Avas the same. There might perchance be another reason. She AAras clear-eyed, and she might be troubled by the effect of unceasing prosperity on her husband. His paper trade AATas flourishing, his book binding had called a second press into use, the chief literary and scientific men of the toAvn and neighbourhood resorted to his shop, and yet he Avas not content. The faster his capital increased the stronger became his desire to reduplicate that increase. He had said to her one evening, as she"], [178, "166 IN HIS OWN H.4ND. nursed her youngest boy by the fire, in their cheerily appointed sitting-room. \" I do perceive that more profit doth arise from the new trade than the old. Blank paper doth speak in fairer language than printed. One can only furnish the head, the other lines the pocket. If paper payeth the seller so Avell, it must pay the maker better. I would I had a paper-mill at Avork.\" \" Prithee, William,\" she had answered with a troubled expression in her clear eyes, \"leave well alone. Be content Avith thy pre sent gains.

But for all that the idea took root and was not to be blown down by the feeble breath of a woman, though that woman was his hon oured AATife. He Avas not content with saving in the year thrice the money he had formerly done, but hankered after more : possibly the many hun dreds lying idle in his desk suggested the desirability of turning them to account. Eight or nine months later he said to his"], [179, "HOW TIME FLIES. 167 wife one night Avhen adding to his store, \" See my dear love, here are seven hundred and seventy-seven pounds lying like the talent the man hid in a napkin and buried.

It therefore becomes needful to invest in some safe concern, and I seriously incline to build a paper mill. I am no longer ignorant of the manufacture, I have o o studied the subject, you are aware. There is now land to be had at twenty shillings an acre on Handsworth Heath, whence I first beheld the beauties of this wonderful town. And there can be no dearth of water since Rushton and Eamiis diverted Hockley Brook to supply their rolling mill. What is thy opinion ? \" \" Nay, AVilliani,\" responded the prudent little Avife, then knitting a sock for Avee Cathe rine in the summer twilight, \" I gave thee my opinion last year.

He discovered that to make any business succeed the master's presence Avas essential, and that as he Avas not ubiquitous, either mill or Avare house must suffer. He could rely on Thomas for anything requiring unremitting care and attention. But though he could take an order and see that it Avas duly executed with precision and punctuality, he lacked the actiAre energy, the tact, the ready tongue, the courteous atten tion Avhich had made the book shop and library a resort for the leading intellects of the tOAvn. Vill Avould have been a much better sub stitute for his master had he been older, for he had all the briskness wanting in Thomas. Another apprentice Avas obtained, another assistant hired for the rough work, but they required training, and only added to their master's annoA'ance.

Can it be Avondered that tender-hearted and emotional AVilliam Hutton, overwrought by his grief and many cares, in the end collapsed and became as yelloAv as one of his OAvn guineas ? Doctors may insist, as Dr. Dowler did, that jaundice is not infectious or contagious ; but given the action of the same troubles other husbands and Avives haATe taken it, and Avould take it in succession as did this pair in the old Gateway. This may seem a doleful record, but it is historic, and not to be slurred over. No doubt it was a check to the prosperous man. If so it Avas salutary. Success is a steed ever apt to bolt with its rider. It served, moreover, to bring out the sterling qualities of Vill and Patience. Those of Thomas needed no test.

The living rillet of truth gave force and confirma tion to the lie of which it formed an insepar able part. Vill had Avarm feelings and generous im pulses. His heart softened towards the being whose life had been blighted by father and wife alike, and he Avas led to dip deeper and deeper into his small store for the man who called him \" son,\" and traded on his claim to paternity. Once impressed with the belief that Francis Field was more sinned against than sinning, he was prepared to excuse or to overlook the brutal treatment of himself, and to feel it Avas his bounden duty to surrender the money lying idle in his box. Yet was he loth to part Avith it, so many inchoate projects lay with the coins, and in parting with them he felt as if he Avas giving away the fortune he had meant to achieve in the future. SloAvly, very sloAvly had his little store ac cumulated, lie knew something of the value of money, no doubt over estimated it by its scarcity, and he Avas not so certain of the re cipient's verity as to pour it forth in one abundant largesse.

Be that as it may, the constant drain, the"], [219, "A V.4MPIRE. 207 frequent calls for secret meetings harassed and disquieted the youth, and made him silent and abstracted. Even little Catherine, his pet, complained he \" took no notice of her,\" and three-year-old Tom had to solicit the pick a-back rides formerly volunteered. Mrs. Hutton herself remarked to Thomas and to her husband when he returned, that \" Vill Avas very much altered since his en counter Avith the abusive tailor.\" The cause was suspected by no one. His master had not been home three weeks Avlien Vill's last coin Avent into the greedy palm of Field. It Avent reluctantly, for Vill could not realize the inability of a strong man to obtaiii Avork, but still it went. He had been told an exaggerated story of an injured shoulder which had nearly cost him an arm, and con sequent inability to perform heavy manual labour, whilst his shabbiness and want of friends precluded clerkly occupation. The lad had nothing more to part with, except his Aveekly wage, and that Avould have been far too small to satisfy the vampire's cupidity had he not had some ulterior object in view.

And so the winter sped, a Avinter notorious for the robbery of peaceful travellers through out the Alidlands. But at length even Vill's credulity Avas exhausted, and he was no longer disposed to be cajoled out of every shilling. It Avas then, when Vill declared his inability to meet any further demands, and suggested that an able man should find some means to earn his oavii living Avithout crippling his son, that Francis Field made a proposal that filled the upright soul of the apprentice with shame and horror."], [221, "CHAPTER XV.

Speech was impossible. He heard his good master vili fied, and himself incited to commit a robbery almost in the same breath, and was dumb with horror.

So he took Vill's petrified consternation as a \\Toiceless leaning toAvards acquiescence. Vill's breathless \"Rob my master?\" did not enlighten him. \" Aye,\" said he, \" follow his lead, and pay yourself ; or if you like it better, tell me Avhere he keeps his desk, and leave the doors un bolted.

Inwardly cursing his own precipitance, he hissed Avith Ioav vehemence, \"Harkee, young ster ! \" and Vill thought he heard the click of a pistol, \"I've half a mind to send a bullet through your insolent young brain.\" Then with an aAvful imprecation he went on, \" Do you fancy yourself able to preserve your master's property, or your oavii good name, whilst I or Peg have wrongs to avenge.

His own master, and the great Mr. Baskerville had alike risen from small beginnings. He had an ambition also to rise ; but he was too proud to owe the elevation he sought to any dis honourable act. He had dared to raise his aspirations higher still, even to the beautiful heiress, Miss Carew, the immeasurable dis tance betAveen them being but a stimulant to raise himself little by little nearer to her level. That he Avas not much over sixteen goes for nothing ; it is just the age to indulge in visionary schemes for the future. The shock he had received from Tommy Green's taunt Avas a mere fillip to that wdiich had Avrung his heart on hearing from Mr. Thomas that his father Avas a vagabond con sorting with rogues.

Nevertheless he questioned AVilliam Hutton pretty closely, if in an off hand manner, about the said Dolly and what he knew of her, and William, not being of a reticent nature and thrown off his guard, told more than Avas perhaps advisable.

The Avorld then Avas larger than it is now. At least, distance had not been disturbed by steam and telegraphy.

Old grudges were forgotten, on his side at least.
