But the so-called River Plate is little more than the estuary of its two great affluents \u2014 the River Parana and the River Uruguay.

The Uruguay also rises in a province of Brazil, and after a course of 1020 miles falls into the River Plate, within a short distance of the mouth or delta of the Parana. The tract of the continent of South America watered by these great rivers and their branches is enormous. A portion of the Empire of Brazil and of the Argentine Republic, the Republic of Paraguay, and the Republic of Uruguay, are commercially connected by sea, and by the river com munication due to the River Plate and its tributaries.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION. The Republic of Uruguay is officially known Geogi-aphi as the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay, twn?escr'P and familiarly called the Banda Oriental, from its geographical position on the eastern side or left bank of the large river from which it takes its name. The territory of the Republic is comprised between the 30th and 35th degrees of latitude S., and 53\u00b0 25' 5\" and 57\u00b0 42' 25\" of longitude W. It is irregular in form, and in some sense a peninsula ; having a seaboard to the eastward on the Atlantic of 200 miles ; a coast-line on the south and south-west on the estuary of the Plate of 155 miles ; and a shore line to the westward along the River Uruguay K"], [20, "The Republic of Uruguay. 2 Territory \u25a0 ind popu lation. of 155 miles. Its northern boundaries, separating the Republic from Rio Grande do Sul, a province of the Brazilian Empire, are Lake Merim, the secondary rivers, the Chuy, the Yaguaron, and the Cuareim, and a cuchilla, or ridge of hills, known by the name of Santa Ana. In regard to extent of territory as well as number of inhabitants, the Republic of Uruguay ranks low in the scale amongst the countries of the New World. Its area is not over 7,036 square leagues, and by the highest estimate its population cannot much exceed 450,000. But in some important respects it assumes a very enviable position compared with other States, either of South America or of Central America. Independently of its temperate climate and physical characteristics, resembling those of the most favoured European countries, it is absolutely free from any vestige of that indigenous, or Indian population, which, in many South American countries, is still the chief social and political bane. Even the Africans imported in former years as slaves, and who, until lately, formed the mass"], [21, "General Description. 3 of the soldiery of the Republic, and were largely employed as household servants and in other menial capacities, have now nearly disappeared. The Creole population itself in the w7hole of the Republic is scarcely more than two to one compared with the foreigners ; whilst in the metropolitan department of Montevideo, the native population of Spanish extraction, and of mixed Indian and European blood, exceeds by very little the number of residents of other nationalities.* The proportions are 590 natives, 400 foreigners, and ten Africans in every 1000 inhabitants. By Article viii. of the Constitu tion, the sons of foreigners born in the country are treated as citizens of the Republic, and, it must be borne in mind, are included as natives in the foregoing estimates. It is a fact, perhaps unexampled in any Property other country, that in the department ot foreigners, Montevideo there are 5372 foreigners who possess land and houses as freehold property, whilst there are only 2904 native freeholders. The foreign population of that department consists principally of Spaniards, Italians, and * See also ' Population Statistics,' page 115. 11 2"], [22, "The Republic of Uruguay. 4 French. The Spaniards and French are mostly from the Basque provinces of their respective countries. Estimated by the amount of her exports and imports, the relative position of Uruguay can be appreciated at once, by taking the com paratively large states of Latin America, the Empire of Brazil, the Argentine Republic, Chile, Peru, and Mexico, in the order of their commercial importance, and placing the Republic of Uruguay next, or sixth in the list ; wdiere according to trade statistics, she duly appears.

In National Schools for primary and gratuitous education, the Banda Oriental compares favourably, not only with South American countries, but with most countries in the world. In the United States of North America, the number of school children in proportion to the population is over 10 per cent. ; in Canada it is 6 per cent. ; in the Argentine Republic, 4 per cent. ; in Chile, 4 per ceDt. In Uruguay, it was calculated that there were in 1879, 19,573 scholars at the National Schools, or 4<| per cent, in propor tion to the population. This, of course, is Education."], [23, "General Description. 5 irrespective of private schools, where the number of pupils is, more or less, 1 3,000. According to the latest statistics (1882), it is said that 40,000 children of both sexes receive the benefits of public instruction ; that is, one in seventeen of the population, or nearly 6 per cent. ; still, it has been esti mated that there are over 100,000 children from 5 to 15 years of age in the Republic. In the Empire of Brazil the proportion is not 1 per cent. ; and for Mexico, Peru, and other Spanish American countries no educa tional statistics are at hand, and in some cases they probably do not exist. In comparing the social and commercial position of Uruguay with that of other countries of the New World, it is well to notice that amongst the 16 states of Latin origin, there is Brazil with a population of ten millions, and an area of 3,100,104 square miles ; Mexico with a population of over nine millions, and an area of 1,030,442 square miles ; the Argentine Republic with a popula tion over two millions, and an area of 1,290,000 square miles. Then follow such states as Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Columbia, with"], [24, "6 The Republic of Uruguay. Causes of advance ment. populations varying from one to three millions, and with areas varying from 131,000 to 473,000 square miles. Among the smaller states with populations varying from 80,000 to 450,000, and with areas varying from 9500 to 80,000 square miles, Uruguay stands first in regard to population, and is second only to Paraguayan extent of territory. The respective areas of the two countries are 76,000 and 80,000 square miles. Either of the two is considerably larger than England and Wales. It is evident that the importance of a country is not to be estimated either by the absolute number of its population, or by the extent of its territory. In the higher respects of advancement in commerce and civilisation, as well as in the superior character of the population as a question of race \u2014 forming so valuable a guarantee for the future \u2014 the Republic of Uruguay stands amongst the first of the American States of Spanish origin. Her wonderful advance within the last quarter of a century may be due mainly to her geographical position ; but it can also"], [25, "General Description. 7 fairly be ascribed to the complete religious tolerance, as well as to the general liberality of the government of the Republic ; to the social freedom and equality which exists within the different classes of society ; to the energy and business capacities of the native population ; and, above all, to their exceeding hospitality to foreigners. In a very general sense, the history of the History Banda Oriental may be said to date from the beginning of the sixteenth century, when the Rio de la Plata was first discovered by Juan Diaz de Solis. But in point of fact, the territory between the River Uruguay and the Atlantic, and to the south of the present frontier of Brazil, was, for more than a century after that period, all but abandoned to the savage tribes of unknown origin, who inhabited the banks of the great rivers in those regions.* The country remained little more than a pasture-ground for herds of wild cattle and horses, which the Spaniards, who had introduced them from Europe, left to multiply unheeded. The first settlers seem * The aborigines were a yellow-skinned Indian tribe, a branch of the Pampa race of Indians, and called Charnias."], [26, "The Republic of Uruguay. 8 to have preferred the opposite shore of the River Plate, and the borders of the rivers Parana and Paraguay. The objects ever present to their minds, were the gold and treasures of the earth they imagined might exist further towards the interior of the new land. It was not until the seventeenth century, that the wild herds of cattle in the Banda Oriental attracted the notice of the Portuguese, who had partially peopled the coasts of the territory now known as Brazil. The Portuguese freely carried off the cattle, on the pretext that the country on the left bank of the River Uruguay to the shores of the Rio de la Plata belonged to the crown of Portugal. The Spaniards asserted a pre ferent claim, on the plea of their having founded, in 1624, the town of Santo - Domingo Soriano. The principal settle ment of the Portuguese was at Colonia del Sacramento, on the eastern shore of the River Plate, immediately in front of Buenos Aires. It was founded in 1680, and is still known as Colonia, a half-deserted little port, with vestiges yet visible of the old Portu guese fortifications. Although distant thirty"], [27, "General Description. 9 miles from Buenos Aires, it is often seen from that city, in the calm weather preceding a storm, as a mirage high above the horizon. The founding of the town and fort of Colonia del Sacramento, by the Portuguese, was the event that first led to a series of long struggles for the possession of the Banda Oriental. For a century and a quarter, the country belonged nominally and alternately to the Spaniards and Portuguese. The real history of Uruguay can scarcely be said to have commenced until the beginning of the present century; and its history as an indepen dent state dates only from the year 1828. Early in the nineteenth century, the question of dominion was finally settled in favour of the Spaniards ; and in the mean time, in spite of wars, the Banda Oriental was being peopled, and civilization con tinued to advance. In the central districts, as well as on the coasts of the Atlantic and of the large rivers, the Spaniards had founded many small towns and ports, the most important of which was Montevideo. In the year 1726, the Captain-General, Don Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, officially"], [28, "The Republic of Uruguay. 10 established the limits of that city and of the adjoining territory. The boundaries of the the latter were, independently of the River Plate, the range of mountains near Maldonado on the north east ; the rivers Cebollate and Yi to the north and west; and the river Santa Lucia in the south and west. The area comprised within these limits was at that time thought sufficient, not only for the settlers, who then numbered about 300 families, but for their remote descendants. The productions of the soil according to an official report made in 1787 were, in addition to a natural and luxuriant pasturage, wheat, barley, flax and small quantities of hemp.* Farms existed high up in the mountainous district of Minas, on the banks of the small and rapid streams, the Metal, San Francisco and Campanero, which the settlers utilised * Report of the Cabildo, or Municipality of Montevideo, to the Viceroy, 1787. The authors of the 'Album de la Republica Oriental del Uruguay' (1882), who print the report verbatim, are of opinion that it has been published for the first time in that work. The account given therein of the productions of the country in the time of the early Spanish settlers differs essen tially from the less favourable facts and opinions recorded in encyclop\u00e6dias and other English works in which the history of Uruguay is treated."], [29, "General Description. 11 for the purposes of irrigation. At the sides of the rivers trees grew abundantly, and served for firewood and the building of huts, but not for general building purposes, as the fibre of the native wood was not close and firm enough for timber. Bread and beef were then the common aliment of the settlers, who generally farmed their own lands. About one-third laboured for other proprietors. So near to Montevideo as the San Jose and the Santa Lucia, grains of gold were found in the beds of the streams flowing into those rivers ; but at that era there was neither the neces sary skill nor machinery to profitably wash the auriferous sand and gravel. The old document, here quoted, quaintly adds, that in the district called Las Minas, lead, silver, copper, and gold, existed ; but so mixed or bound together, that those who tried to separate them \" lost their time and their money.\" Even in those days it was dis covered that in that country the most advantageous objects of industry were hides and tallow. The process of salting hides had just commenced ; and it was hoped that with experience, the art would eventually arrive at"], [30, "The Reptiblic of Uruguay. 12 perfection. Great expectations were raised in regard to wheat, if only a system of barter for cotton, timber and mate could be estab lished, by land and water conveyance, with the Jesuit Missions of Paraguay. Already the necessity was foreseen of domesticating the cattle, instead of allowing them to run wild, and by their wanderings occasion disputes amongst neighbouring landowners. In the early days of the Spanish settle ments in these regions, the whole of the River Plate district was included in the Viceroyalty of Peru. Subsequently a separate vice royalty was created in Buenos Aires; and the Banda Oriental, which had been subject to the Colonial Government of Paraguay, Was transferred to that of Buenos Aires. At the beginning of the century, Montevideo was ruled by a military and political governor ap pointed by the Crown of Spain. Maldonado, Colonia, and other places were subject to special military commands. The population of the capital was at that time about 15,000 ; and the same number of people existed in the interior of the province. Colonia had made rapid advance under the dominion of the"], [31, ""], [32, "Stan/brdls GaoplEstAb'0"], [33, "General Description. 13 Portuguese, and was the seat of an active commerce with Europe and the neighbouring Spanish settlements ; but the last time it was taken by the Spaniards, the town was destroyed ; and it gradually sank into its present insignificance. Maldonado, though situated on the Atlantic coast, and being the port nearest to the mining districts and to the largest cattle-growing departments, and possessing a natural harbour of some extent, has never made any considerable progress. The place is noted, however, as having possessed the first Saladero of any importance established in the country. Montevideo, in 1730, six years after its official creation, was a strong place from a military point of view, and its streets were planned out and named. The city contained a hospital, schools, and a theatre. The foundations were already laid of the Cathedral, which has only recently been completed. At the beginning of this century Montevideo was a prosperous commercial port, and numbered amongst its inhabitants a few English merchants. It was in such a position when an event happened which led indirectly to others that have proved of"], [34, "The Republic of Uruguay. 14 serious importance in the recent history of Uruguay. The commander of an English expedition, on its way so the Cape of Good Hope, conceived the idea of taking possession of Buenos Aires, the capital of the Spanish viceroyalty. This design was accordingly effected in June 1806; but in the month of August in the same year the invaders were expelled. In the following year the English returned with a considerable force under General Whitelock. On February 3, 1807, as a preparatory operation, they took Monte video by storm ; and afterwards occupied Colonia, Las Piedras, Canelones and San Jose, which they held until September 9th ; when by the terms of a capitulation more disgrace ful even than his defeat by the Spanish troops and citizens of Buenos Aires on his attempting to enter that city \u2014 Montevideo and the other places held by the British troops in the Banda Oriental w7ere formally surrendered by General Whitelock. The militia of the Banda Oriental had been organised and drilled after the first invasion, for it was expected that the English would return ; and the troops of the Banda Oriental,"], [35, "General Description. 15 under the command of General Liniers, sub sequently took an active part in the defence of Buenos Aires. After the defeat of the British, it was Liniers who insisted that the surrender of Montevideo and other places held by the invaders in the Banda Oriental should be included in the terms of capitulation. Hitherto, in the Spanish colonies on the borders of the River Plate, as in other parts of South America, the Creole population were held in little esteem by the Spaniards, who monopolised all offices of importance, and denied to those born in the country, common political privileges, and treated them as an inferior race. The part which the natives of Buenos Aires, and of the Banda Oriental, had taken in repelling the British attack, and the pusillanimous conduct displayed by the Spanish commander at Montevideo, had in spired the people with a high notion of their own invincibility, and a proportionate con tempt for the regular troops of the King of Spain. The authority of the existing viceroy soon gave place to that of General Don Santiago Liniers, who was named viceroy in his stead. The Governor of Montevideo, as"], [36, "16 The Republic of Uruguay. well as the Cabildo, pronounced against Liniers at the end of 1808, and in January 1809 the Spanish or royal troops in Buenos Aires re volted against the assumption of power by the \" patriots \" or native forces. In that city the royal troops and authorities were vanquished, and the patriot revolution triumphed com pletely on the 25th May, 1810. The Junta, or government there established, endeavoured to e:ain the adhesion of all the authorities and of the people in the viceroyalty. But the Spaniards still in power in Montevideo refused their adhesion, and declared war against the revolutionary Government in Buenos Aires. The Junta in the latter city then sowed the seeds of revolt in the Banda Oriental, and sent troops to support the patriots, confiding the command of the Uruguay militia to Don Jose Artigas. After various encounters, and the rising in mass of the rural population of the Banda Oriental, the power of Spain in the Rio de la Plata was subdued for ever, by the taking of Montevideo in June 1814, by the Buenos Airean general, Alvear. It was then that the succession of caudillos or military chieftains, which has proved the"], [37, "General Description. 17 bane of these young republics, commenced. It has continued up to a very recent date, but latterly, and for many years past, with diminished force, until the era of pronuncia mientos may now be said to have died out. After the triumph of the revolution, the Banda Oriental was formed into a separate province, with the same privileges enjoyed by others in the Argentine Confederation. General Artigas had acquiesced in that arrangement, but claimed for himself the post of Governor of Montevideo. This was not acceded to by the authorities at Buenos Aires. In February 1815, he obliged the government of Montevideo to withdraw their troops from the city; and carrying the war into the Argentine provinces he established a military despotism and an anarchy remembered to this day with horror. About the same time the troops, and the most distinguished generals of Buenos Aires, were engaged in assisting in the War of Independence then raging on the distant slopes of the Andes, east and west The Brazilian Government fearing that the anarchy occasioned by Artigas might extend c"], [38, "18 The Republic of Uruguay. to its own territory, and calculating that the Argentine Government was unable to expel him, thought the opportunity favourable for the occupation of the Banda Oriental by Por tuguese and Brazilian forces. Accordingly troops were sent from Lisbon ; and under the command of General Lecor, the Brazilian militia and Portuguese troops, on the pre tence of restoring order, invaded the province at three distinct points ; and on the 20th of January, 1817, they entered the city of Montevideo. The government of Buenos Aires at first seemed to countenance the invasion ; but afterwards, seeing that Brazil intended con quest, it was inclined to support Artigas on certain conditions, which the Caudillo did not think fit to accept. Single handed, with the undisciplined militia of Uruguay and the provinces of Santa-fe, Entre-rios, Corrientes and the Missions he had overrun, he gallantly fought against the Portuguese and Brazilians for three years ; but continually defeated, he was ultimately obliged to take refuge in Para guay, where he was persecuted by another Caudillo, Ramirez of Entre-rios."], [39, "Ge7ieral Description. 19 The administration of the Portuguese general, Lecor, in Montevideo, was in the highest degree exemplary and liberal. Private interests were respected ; and public institu tions preserved and fomented. Captivated by his politic government, the conservative classes in the city were easily prevailed upon to favour the ambition of Portugal ; and in a congress of Orientals convened in July 1821 by General Lecor, it was decreed that the Banda Oriental should be incorporated in the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarbes, under the title of the Cisplatine State. Subsequently, when Brazil declared her independence of the crown of Portugal, it became a question whether the Cisplatine State should belong to Portugal or to Brazil, or return to her allegiance to the Argentine Confederation, then called the United Pro vinces of La Plata. In the Banda Oriental itself, there were various political parties who sided with one or other of these propositions ; but owing to the skill of Brigadier Souza de Macedo, it was ultimately decided, without much blood shed, that the people should take the oath of c 2"], [40, "The Republic of Uruguay. 20 months from the day of their landing they established a revolutionary government at Florida. Within four months, the assembly of the people's representatives annulled the incorporation of the state with Brazil, and united it to the rest of the River Plate provinces. In the fifth month, Rivera gained a brilliant action at the Rincon de Haedo. In the sixth month, the Orientals won the famous victory on the plains of Sarandi ; and on the 24th of October, 1825, the Argentine Congress ratified the re-incorporation of the Banda Oriental with the United Provinces of La Plata. As a natural consequence, the Emperor of Brazil the following year declared war against the Argentine Republic. The Argentine General, Alvear, subsequently invaded the territory of Brazil ; his vanguard consisting of Orientals under Lavalleja. The Buenos Aireans had in the interval armed a naval squadron, which was placed under the com mand of an Irishman, Admiral Brown, whose name has become famous in these countries. A series of combats on land and sea continued for a year and a half; and amongst the victories more celebrated than others, were"], [41, ""], [42, ""], [43, "General Description. 23 those gained by the land forces over the Brazilians at Juncal and Ituzaingo. In 1828, the belligerents, somewhat exhausted, accepted the mediation of Great Britain ; and by the treaty of peace that ensued, the Oriental province of Uruguay was declared a state, sovereign and independent. The Con stituent Assembly, by which the Republic was formally constituted, met at Montevideo on the 18th of July, 1830. It was at tins period that a man rose into note in the Argentine Confederation, who was destined to exercise an overshadowing and pernicious influence on both sides of the River Plate. In 1829 Don Juan Manuel Rosas became governor of Buenos Aires. Possessed of great capacity, he maintained tranquillity in his native province, and extended his sway over the neighbouring states of the Confedera tion ; but his system of government was despotic ; and his rule was for some years one of terror. His reputed ambition to force the State of Paraguay into the Argentine Con federation involved him in a war with Brazil. His intervention in the intestine quarrels of the Republic of Uruguay, and his attempt to close the River Parana to foreign vessels, led"], [44, "The Republic of Uruguay. 24 him into hostilities with England and France ; whose joint naval squadrons protected Montevideo from his attacks by sea, whilst his troops and their Oriental allies under General Oribe besieged the city. The siege of Montevideo bv the Blancos or Whites, as the Oriental partizans of Oribe were called, con- tinued for nine years ; and lor that period, from 1842 to 1851, the history of the Republic of Uruguay is the history of the defence of Montevideo; chiefly supported by Italian legionaries under General Garibaldi, and French Basques under the command of native officers, together with the few troops the nominal government or inside party \u2014 the Colorados \u2014 or Reds, could muster. Oribe, during the war between the Argentines and Brazilians, was attacked by the Oriental cavalry of the Red party under General Flores, assisted by the Brazilian infantry, and sur- rendered in October 1851. On the 3rd of February in the following year, Rosas himself was completely overthrown at Monte Caseros, near Buenos Aires, by the combined forces of Brazil and the Argentines in revolt under the Governor of Entre-rios, General Justo Jose"], [45, "General Description. 25 Urquiza. From that date, when the normal intercourse of Montevideo with Buenos Aires and the riverain ports of the Uruguay and Parana, as well as with the interior of the Republic itself, and with Brazil, was resumed. the Banda Oriental may be said to have re- commenced its national existence. Whilst her material progress has continued with little intermission, her political history during the last twenty or thirty years has been again chequered by many internal troubles, and domestic events, as yet too recent or too insignificant to be included in the present historical sketch. The old parties, the Blancos and Colorados have long since disappeared ; and if, as occurs in all countries, other rivalries and other political parties have taken their place, the same bitter, and even savage animosities of an older period no longer exist ; the constant communication with Europe, and the general influence of a newer education and of different ideas, is permeating all classes in the capital, and gradually extending to the rural districts, where foreigners are introducing the habits and industrial methods of European countries."], [46, "The Reptiblic of Uruguay. 26 THE CAPITAL. Montevideo, the seat of government and capital of the Republic of Uruguay, was originally built on the seaward and narrower end of a. small cape, or as it is sometimes called, a peninsula, at the mouth of the River Plate ; an estuary where, at this point, the water is salt, as it is for many miles further up, in the direction of Buenos Aires. About half way towards the inland extremity of the cape, where it begins to widen, there existed till quite recently the remains of the citadel of the first Spanish colonists, and of the gateway and walls of the old city. The principal public buildings, and the more important and business portions of Montevideo, are still within the boundaries of the old walls, but of late years the city has gradually extended over the wider part of the cape, and on to the main land. According to"], [47, "The Capital. 27 the plans formally laid out by the municipal authorities, in parallel lines of streets, arranged at right angles to one another, and enclosing blocks or squares of regular dimen sions, Montevideo will in course of a few years spread over a very large area ; and from its picturesque and healthy situation, open on two sides to the sea, and in other directions bounded by hill and stream and grassy plains, it should have scarcely a rival in South America as a place of residence. As a question of latitude, Montevideo lies a Geographi few miles to the south of the city of Buenos Aires, the capital of the Argentine Republic, on the opposite side of the estuary. The distance east and west between the two ports is about 120 miles. The width of the river from Montevideo to Point Las Piedras, on the Argentine coast, is 53 miles. At the mouth, from \" cape to cape,\" that is, from Cape St. Mary on the sea-coast of the Banda Oriental, to Cape St. Anthony, on the coast of the province of Buenos Aires, the River Plate is 150 miles wide. The population of the city of Montevideo Population. in 1879 was 91,167. The environs contained"], [48, "28 The Republic of Uruguay. Description 19,000 inhabitants ; giving a total population of 110,167. The population may be just double what it was twenty years ago ; but owing to the late commercial crisis, which has not been confined to these countries, but has been universal, it was rather less in 1879 than some five or six years before that period. On entering the bay, or harbour, of Monte video, the most prominent object is the Cerro, or \" Mount,\" from which the city takes its name. The bay is supposed to have once formed the crater of a volcano, and is shaped like a horse-shoe. To the left, the Cerro, surmounted by an old fort and a lighthouse, rises 505 feet, and faces the white turrets and domes of the city to the right, clustering round the cathedral placed on a slight elevation. From the Cerro towards the land, the out line of the shore rapidly falls, but again rises gently at the Cerrito, or \" Little Mount,\" a slight eminence some distance from the beach, and five or six miles from the city. It is celebrated as the head-quarters of General Oribe, the commander of the forces besieging"], [49, "The Capital. 29 Montevideo for nine years \u2014 from 1842 to 1851. In the hollow of the bay the land is low, but well wooded by orchards, and studded with the quintas, or suburban residences, of the citizens of Montevideo. Part of the shore of the bay has been enclosed by a sea-wall or embankment, which forms one of the many new and delightful promenades in the environs of the capital. Towards the Cerro, docks have been recently erected, capable of receiving sea-going vessels of heavy tonnage. There are other docks nearer to the city. The warehouses, the wharves, the shipping of the port, and the lofty custom-house buildings, produce a favourable impression on landing. In its general characteristics, Montevideo is perhaps more European than any city in South America, Viewed at a distance, it rather resembles Cadiz in respect to its position, and the flat roofs of the houses with their turrets, or miradores, as they are called by the inhabitants.

During the heat of the day he will not find in the streets of the city the bustle and activity of London or Liverpool. Still, when the sun is setting behind the Cerro, when the towers of the city, and the shipping in the harbour, and the bay itself, are enlivened by the evening glow and tints of the climate, a certain stir commences quite in keeping with metropolitan gaiety and pretensions.

One-fourth of the soil is still even without ownership. It belongs nominally to the Government, but is not yet surveyed. Under these circumstances, and considering the general characteristics of the country \u2014 consisting of streams with thinly wooded banks, and of vast tracts of undulating pasture land, with here and there a white estancia house, surrounded by a patch of"], [65, "The Rural Districts. 45 newly planted trees, it can be anticipated that the riches of the country consist mainly of flocks and herds. The principal exports are hides, horns, tallow, and wool. Cattle-rearing is the chief industry, and more than any other in the hands of the natives. It requires more land but less labour than agriculture ; and will prosper on coarser land, but requires perhaps more local and special knowledge than sheep-feeding. It cannot be said that the natives succeed cattie better than Englishmen or other foreigners in m the management of a cattle estancia ; but the peones or native labourers are from their infancy trained to the use of the lasso and to the handling of horses and cattle that a few years ago were in many parts allowed to roam wild about the vast tracts of land which some of the larger estancias will often cover. At the present day, the cattle industry, like everything else in the interior of the Republic, is influenced by the existing state of transition from the semi-barbarous freedom or lawless ness of a thinly peopled and pastoral country to a condition similar to that of an English colony, where the competition of skilled Euro-"], [66, "The Republic of Uruguay. 46 pean labour, and the introduction of capital, have effected a revolution in the ruder means formerly employed in the rearing either of sheep or cattle in young countries. That the cattle industry has always been considered the chief industry in the Banda Oriental is easily accounted for ; since, if on an estancia we take the usual proportion of sheep to cattle as 5 to 1, the relative value of the cattle one with another as compared to that of the sheep is as 6 to 1. There is pro- bably no country in the world, not even the neighbouring Argentine Republic, so rich in herds of cattle as the Republic of Uruguay, whether we estimate the number in proportion to population or to extent of territory. In 1878 the proportion was calculated at 32*60 head of cattle per square kilometre and 1385 per cent, of the population. The sheep were calculated at 65 \"2 per kilometre and 2770 per cent, of the population. In the wealthy pro- vince of Buenos Aires, in the neighbouring Republic, the calculations were, in regard to sheep, 215*3 per kilometre, and 8275 per cent, of the population, but the cattle were only in the proportion of 930 head per cent."], [67, "The Rural Districts. 47 of the population, and 24 '2 per square kilometre.

The droughts are more fatal to cattle than to sheep. The old difficulties in the rearing of cattle in South American countries, when the animals were running nearly wild, were the catching, branding, and counting. For some of these purposes the herds were driven to what is called a rodeo, some convenient and well-worn spot on an estate, where they were surrounded by peones, or gauchos as the native peasantry or herdsmen are called, who, well mounted on the small but active horses of the country, and armed with the lasso and bolas, would ride round the herd, and keep the refractory from straying whilst the animals were counted or branded, or points of the better-conditioned were selected and parted for sale. The calves were branded as soon as possible,"], [68, "48 The Republic of Uruguay. to prevent them from wandering into the herds on other estates where they were liable to be claimed by the neighbours. The usual time for marking cattle is in the autumn, when the season is temperate and suited to the more rapid healing of the wounds inflicted by the hot irons. In the northern provinces, and in other parts of the country, the cattle are still wild, and the rough-and-ready native methods of treating them are yet adhered to ; but the gradual introduction of a newer system of adopting wire fencing and of erecting sheds, cattle \" races,\" and various inclosures, is effecting a complete revolution in the cattle industry itself, as well as in the appearance and moral characteristics of some of the rural departments. It is not yet safe to expend capital in too many modern improvements until the consumption of the country and other markets more clearly determine what is required in the way of the breed and condition of the animals. At the present time it may be calculated that over a million and a half of cattle are consumed annually. Of these more than half a million are killed simply for the"], [69, "The Rural Districts. 49 tallow and hides they produce for export.

North of Soriano, on the coast, and formerly in the department of Paysandu, but now in the new department of Rio Negro, is Fray Bentos, where the Liebig Extract is made, and the methods and nature of the work at the saladeros and manufactories of that establish ment are thus described by Mr. Rathbone. He says : \u2014 \"Next morning, about six o'clock, I went down to the galpon, or shed, and found them just beginning to kill. The cattle are, on arrival, driven into large corrales, or pad docks, arranged so as to supply them with water, but no food is given to them. A long, narrow passage, about six or seven feet wide, and skirted by a long, narrow platform path way about the height of the animals' horns, leads down to a small oval paddock, with a similar pathway around and a bridge over the opening into the galpon, which is further closed by a movable beam. Below the bridge is a large, low, square iron truck on a tram way, which runs into the galpon, and branches"], [73, "The Rural Districts. 53 into two parallel lines, so that two trucks may pass each other. Along the left side of the shed are long ranges of rails for hanging meat ; and along the right hand, a flat, slightly shelving, flagged space, for laying the oxen upon. At the end of the shed is a large brine bath for soaking the skins, and beyond this there are further sheds where the skins are piled up with salt previous to being shipped. In saladeros the skins are generally salted, but on estancias the hides are usually dried. As I arrived, about fifty oxen were being hunted down the \" race \" or passage into the fatal paddock. They seemed to have an instinct of what was to follow, for there was a peculiar scared look about many of them. I have been told that when on an estancia any animal is killed for consumption, the herd gather around the body and moan. When the paddock was full and the gate shut, a man with a lasso, of which one end was attached to a steam winch outside (natives call it the \" English horse \"), went round the pathway and threw the noose over the most prominent horns he could see, which were by no means ordinarily the nearest to the bridge."], [74, "The Republic of Uruguay. 54 The winch being set going, the beast was hauled, stumbling and slipping and pushing aside all animals in its way, till its head was chocked up against the upper beam leading into the galpon, upon which stood the killer, who with a stab close behind the head with a large dagger-bladed knife cut the spinal cord, and the animal at once dropped with a heavy thud, but without a struggle, on to the iron truck. The lower beam was then rapidly withdrawn, the lasso disengaged, and the truck run into the galpon by two men. Here, by means of a lasso attached to a horse, the animal was hitched into its place at the side of the shed, where a skinner was waiting for it, who immediately cut its throat and began to skin it. The blood was caught in large scoops and ladled into casks placed for the purpose. Meanwhile the skinner rapidly took the skin off, and though sensation was pro bably entirely destroyed by severance of the spinal cord, yet muscular action was not, and it was rather ghastly to see the struggles of an animal with half its skin off, and even detect a sound painfully like a bellow. These movements seemed to take place when certain"], [75, "The Rural Districts. 55 nerves were touched about the neck, and thus set in action. The skin off, it was taken to the brine bath spoken of. The entrails were taken out and carried away, the ribs cleared of flesh, and the limbs cut off and taken to the opposite side of the galpon, and there all the meat was cut from the bones, and hung up on the rails provided for that purpose, together with that cut off the ribs, &c, still warm and quivering with life. The skull and horns were taken in a different direction. This operation takes from eight to nine minutes on an average, but on occasions has been done in five, and the skinner waits his next turn, which comes every fifteen minutes. As the truck is run out, the alternative truck is run into the paddock, and the beam shot back for another victim. \" The shed contains about twenty-five oxen at a time, so that about a hundred are killed, skinned, and cut up in an hour, and in the height of the killing season as many as twelve hundred are thus disposed of per diem, or from 100,000 to 150,000 a season. Each skinner gets sixpence per head, but if, in skinning, he makes a hole in the skin, he loses his payment"], [76, "The Republic of Uruguay. 56 for that animal. In the height of the season he disposes of about 33 in a day. Not unfre quently the horns of the one lassoed become entangled with the horns of another, and they are brought up to the beam and despatched together ; and though I did not see it, I heard that even three are sometimes thus brought up. During the time the beam is drawn back a frightened beast often makes a dart for it, and sometimes gets through into the galpon, and goes plunging along it, clearing the place of every one in it, and at times ends by going headlong into the brine skin bath, from which it has to be fished out with lassoes as best may be. There are two men always ready with lassoes to intercept it if possible before this happens. The morning I was there no animal got more than its head and shoulders through, but even when this happened all got ready for a prompt disappearance out of the place. After a hundred and fifty were disposed of in an hour and a half, the remainder were left till after breakfast, and the place was cleaned up in a marvellously short time, making it diffi cult to believe that such a scene of blood had been taking place so recently. This is"], [77, "The Rural Districts. 57 explained by every skinner being respon sible for cleaning up the square he occupies.

In 1860 there were 5,218,700 head of cattle in the country, which had been nearly swept clean of livestock in the great war 1842-51. The extraordinary increase was due to the impetus given by the sale for export owing to the gradual establish ment of the saladero industry and the intro duction of the process of salting hides on a larger scale, which raised the price of cattle.

The sheep introduced by the Spaniards in olden times in their trading ships gradually increased to flocks ; but assumed a peculiar type of coarse woolled animals, still well known in the country as criollo ; at the beginning of the century there were about two millions and a half of this class of sheep. It was not until 1832 that Senor Juanico introduced into the department of Canelones a finer Spanish breed. His example was followed in 1838, when a Frenchman im ported into Colonia a flock of 300 Merinos from Naz, in France.

In the year 1872 itself, the exports rose to over 50,000,000 lbs. ; and the phenomenon still remains unexplained that since that date the exports of wool have continued more or less stationary.

Others think the secret is in the overstocking of the land in those departments of the Republic more specially devoted to sheep-feeding. The traditional methods of the country still obtain amongst the smaller sheep-farmers ; and no effort is made to adopt a more scientific handling of the flocks. The avarice of the owners leads them to believe in numbers ; and it is difficult to persuade them that thinning the flocks of the old ewes, and leaving only the best of the animals, will in the end, give from the reduced flock, a greater return of wool. Now that the system of enclosing the land with fencing has become more general, and the parting of the flocks as well as the parting the cattle from the sheep, has been more attended to, a great improvement may be expected. The brilliant success of the wools of the Banda Oriental at the Wool Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in London in the summer of 1881, when they were placed side by side with the choicest specimens of wools from the British Colonies in Australasia, will no doubt give a stimulus to increased exer tion; and convince the native farmers that"], [99, "The Rural Districts. 77 the success of the growers in Uruguay who obtained prizes at that exhibition, was due to care and to judicious methods of crossing the breeds, so as to suit the different crosses to the special conditions of the pasture of the country and the climate.

In his report on the exhibition to the Asociacion Rural of Uruguay, the Consul-General of the Republic in London pointed out, that the reason why, hitherto, so little of the wools of the River Plate countries was consumed in Great Britain, and why nearly the whole of it found its way to Havre and Antwerp, was on account of the defective machinery still obstinately employed by the manufacturers of Bradford and other seats of the British woollen manufacture. Their machinery has been gradually adapted to work the long, clean, bright, and compara tively coarse-fibred British wools, free from the seed and vegetable matter, which from the nature of the grass in the River Plate districts,"], [100, "78 The Republic of Uruguay. still disfigure their shorter fibred, finer, and softer Merino wools. From the long, coarse, but lustrous Lincoln wool, the English manufacturers made a de scription of goods, called lustres. In dresses, they were bright looking, but stiff, like alpaca goods ; and of late years they have gone out of fashion, and are likely to remain so, as they cannot be compared in appearance or comfort with the soft Merino goods of French and Belgian manufacture. To work the softer but less clean Merino wools produced cheaply in the River Plate, it was necessary to invent a certain kind of carding machine. This was done in France ; and the Belgians promptly adopted the in vention. The astounding result in Belgium, was that whilst, from 1850 to 1855, only 11,000 bales of River Plate wool were imported, the importations increased from 1S70 to 1875 to 158,000 bales; and in place of the manufacture of woollen yarn being, as in 1850, only 29,000 kilogrammes, barely sufficient for the home consumption, it so increased with the employment of the new machinery, that Belgium, in 1879, exported"], [101, "The Rural Districts. 79 to England and other places, 6,58S,000 kilo grammes. Visibly, but very slowly, the subject gains the attention of the Bradford manufacturers. In the meantime, Messrs. Platt Bros. & Co., of Oldham, Messrs. J. & W. McNaught, and Messrs. J. Petrie, of Rochdale, have invented machines which at the exhibition at the Crystal Palace could be seen combing and carding the River Plate wools into yarn, and extracting the seeds and other matter, at the rate of consumption of 1000 lbs. of wool daily. Sooner or later the French system of carding will be general in England ; and London will become a great market for River Plate wools. What arrives now, either of River Plate or Australian wool is mostly trans-shipped, and re-exported to the Continent. The following particulars are condensed from a detailed description of the sheep, and sheep industry, in Mr. Rathbone's pamphlet. The sheep chiefly bred in the River Plate Breeds of countries may be roughly divided into four varieties: \u2014 1, The Native, or Criolla ; 2, English ; 3, Merino ; and 4, Mixed, or Mestiza. 1.

Of these, Lincolns are the chief; but Romney Marsh and Southdown are becoming more looked after. Southdowns are better for mutton than wool, and are there fore chiefly available for the neighbourhoods of large meat markets, but might become more valuable in the event of the export of mutton ; but this is not likely to take any large pro portions at present. English sheep, as a rule, run larger than Merinos ; their wool is not so fine, greasy, or close, and they can be shorn much quicker \u2014 though the shearers get the same sum per head as for Merinos. The wool, when washed, gives a much larger percent age of clean wool than Merinos, say English 55 to 60 per cent., and Merinos, 34 to 40 per cent. The English sheep are better nurses than the Merinos, which, when a storm comes, scamper off, leaving their lambs to take care of themselves, while an English mother will not be induced to desert her lamb. English sheep scatter in feeding, while Merino sheep feed very closely together, and it seems"], [103, "The Rural Districts. 81 a question whether Merinos do not tread down the ground more than English, though the latter are supposed to eat more, being larger bodied in proportion to the weight of wool. 3. Merino, may be divided into Negrettis, which have been bred in Germany from a Spanish stock, and Rambouillets, which have been bred in France. The wool is very thick, fine, and greasy in both varieties, and washes very light in comparison with English wool. The Negrettis chiefly prevail in Uruguay, and the Rambouillets are more fancied in the Argentine provinces, being for the most part of a larger body. 4. Mestiza are the various breeds produced by crossing the previous varieties. It is quite a question whether, by crossing, a breed of sheep may not be produced specially adapted to the climate and grass of the Plate, but the question is yet in its infancy.

A hospitable welcome, a well-built mansion, everything about orderly and well-arranged, and the language of home spoken on all sides, almost made us forget that we were so far away From the azotea* of the house we had a fine view of the Estancia lands, stretching on each side for some miles. Close about the house were the farm buildings ; the galpon, or shed, for the wool-press and shearing \u2014 in front of which are arranged the enclosures of hurdles, used for shutting-up the flocks for shearing, or curing scab or other diseases. Behind this shed lay the corrales, or large cattle-yards \u2014 square enclosures, with high stono walls, used for shutting-up and branding the horned cattle. More to the right are placed enclosures of iron wire fencing, for cultivation or shutting-in the fine stock of sheep introduced from Europe ; whilst at a little distance appeared the nearest sheep stations : others, still farther away, so placed as to allow sufficient run or pasturage ground for each flock ; the outside, or more distant ones, appearing like specks on the far-off horizon.\" . . .

He says : \u2014 \" We spent two or three days in pleasant rides to other puestos (stations) of the Estancia ; and visited some smaller establishments more recently founded by our countrymen : finding all well-contented and looking brightly on their future prospects. I am sure their success will be well merited, for it is not to be denied that the new beginner, with small means, must undergo some considerable hardships. Little do their comfortably housed relatives at home know what a different picture the house presents here ! And it is certainly very neces sary for a man to have plenty of pluck before he settles as a sheep-farmer in these parts. It is all very well to tell you about a nice house, good dinner, a well-arranged establishment on a large scale, getting-up in the morning and finding your horses ready-saddled, and other things in the same pleasant strain \u2014 this is the end, and a very successful end ; but to attain this you must have a beginning, and most generally with a limited capital. These reflections are forced upon me after my morning's visit to a young beginner, though I was glad to find he was not at all cast down by the deprivation he is passing through. He told me he started some two years since, renting land for two or three flocks. When he went to work, there was not a building on the place ; and whilst making his house he carted and carpentered with the others ; the only difference, perhaps, was that he worked a good deal harder. They slept on the ground, with a few planks to cover them; they cooked by turns \u2014 beef and biscuit : a ready meal.

Then came the wet days \u2014 out in all the storm, returning to the solitary hut cold and drenched, with no fire and nothing cooked, not a soul or welcome word to cheer or encourage. Perhaps you change and are getting a little warm, when you hear the flock going away, so you have again to start out. Again you get wet through, and perhaps find that your horses, as yet only half-settled, have cleared out for their former home. Then you begin with a few horned cattle \u2014 for you think it would be nice to have some, even if only to give you a little milk \u2014 but, like the horses, they will stray, and you have many weary rides in search of them, with an over-worked horse, in the heat of the sun \u2014 more trying even than the cold and rain. Besides all this, there is house drudgery, for a beginner is often his own cook and servant-of-all-work, and often you lie down as you get up ; and the unswept floor encourages fleas and other insects, which increase more quickly than your sheep. These trials are the certain lot of all small beginners, but they go on with the hope of a bright future, and think of the next lambing season, and what increase they will get ; and of the approaching clip, and what they will get for the wool : and build up a good many castles, I hope, for their sakes, on a good foundation. Certainly, how ever, with all its liberty, and the blue skies, and brilliant hopes, the starting is hard times.\" Sheep The foregoing description of the country, farming at the present with statements of returns on capital invested, date probably from twenty years ago or more, but the Estancia Accounts can be compared with the following bond fide details, taken from a"], [113, "The Rural Districts. 91 private letter from an English farmer in the Republic of Uruguay, and dated Aug. 13., 1881.

The cost of fencing may be set down at about \u00a340 or \u00a350 per mile \u2014 that is, if the fencing is to keep in sheep as well as cattle. \" Rents of course vary according to situation, but to get land at anything like a low rent, one must go pretty well up to the frontiers of Brazil \u2014 the confines of civilisation.

It was about the year 1866 that transatlantic steam navigation from the Mediterranean began to assume its present proportions ; and in the south of Europe there was something like a mania for emigration. The emigration from Italy in the years 1866, 1867, and 1868 formed nearly one half of the whole emigra tion to Montevideo.

Of these 16,367 have applied to the Central Board of Lmmigration ; 1112 have been housed by the Board ; and 15,525 have received employment through the aid of the Board. 41,214 have received employment direct, in the city or departments.

Senor Lucio Rodriguez, Secretary of the Central Board of Immigration, calculates that in 12 years (1867-1878) Uruguay received 169,778 immigrants, of whom only 1335 were lodged at the expense of the Board. The great falling off in the immigration during the years 1873 to 1877 has continued more or less to the period included in the latest statistics (1882). Now that the country"], [129, "General Statistics. 107 is reviving, there is every hope that the flow of emigration from Europe will return to the Republic of Uruguay, as it has done to the neighbouring Republic, where, after a com parative lull, the number of immigrants by the latest accounts has reached 10,000 monthly. The Government of Uruguay has established Board of a \" Board \" or \" Central Commission of Immi- tion. gration.\" The Government has no agents in Europe, and has made no attempts to influence emigration until quite lately, when it drew the attention of its consuls in Europe to the subject. The \" Central Commission \" was formed simply with the object of giving advice to immigrants on their arrival in the country, helping them to obtain employment, and, in exceptional cases, affording pecuniary assis tance. The Commission is aided in its duties by the authorities and officials of the port on the arrival of the emigrant vessels. It has also obtained the co-operation of the proprietors of the Villa Colon \u2014 an important rural establishment situated six miles from the"], [130, "108 The Republic of Uruguay. capital \u2014 where newly-arrived immigrants who are able and willing to work are provided with board and lodging gratis, until they find permanent and remunerative employment. In November 1879 an Asylum for Immi- grants was established, which holds 1000 persons, and contains 24 rooms for families, offices, &c. Up to January 1880, $1782 have been expended in ten months, and shelter has been provided for 1270 individuals. The greater portion of these were Italians, and there were also a few French, Germans, and Swiss. These were all placed ultimately in the \" Swiss \" and \" Cosmopolitan \" agricul- tural colonies. The Government facilitated their transport by steamer and railway. In consequence of the circular issued by the Government to the European consuls in respect to emigration, some 20 families, in all 131 persons, arrived in April 1880. The Government was not well prepared for their arrival, but it did all that was possible, and advanced to them $5032, repayable in five years, and found them employment in the agricultural colonies. The Report of the Ministry of Finance"], [131, "General Statistics. 109 (1882) says: \u2014 \"It is generally supposed that immigration increases consumption, and by its additional labour increases production. Truly, it is well to consider the point, since the increase of population in a fertile and pro gressive country like this Republic is one of the fundamental elements of its advance. But it is desirable that the immigration should be voluntary, spontaneous, and not fomented by contracting agents abroad, who as a rule promise more than they can perform, and the ultimate benefit is slight either to the colonist or to the country to which he emigrates. The voluntary emigrant will elect the country which is progressive, the climate that is most healthy, and the place where the best security is offered to his labour, as well as to the capital he may possess. Moreover, it is well to bear in mind that, in order that the current of immigration shall be a reality as in the United States or in the Argentine Republic, it is necessary that a country shall offer to the immigrant the land he has to cultivate and make productive, and on such easy conditions that the results of his labour shall at the outset secure him a fair living. It is difficult"], [132, "The Reptiblic of Urtiguay. 110 Transfer of Land. to imagine that agriculturists and their families who may be more or less well off in their own countries will transfer themselves to this Republic without guarantee that they will find lands suited to their labour and calling ; and at present in the Republic there is no practical, useful, and far-seeing legisla tion with the object of apportioning the public lands and dividing properties without pre judice to the actual possessors and raising serious questions in the future.\" This very frank statement on the part of the then Minister of Finance, Sefior Don Juan L. Cuestas, can only be understood as indicating his desire to urge on the attention of the Government the necessity which exists for something analogous to a \" homestead law \" in the Republic for the better encourage ment of immigration.

The land, in these cases, must be stocked and utilised to a limited extent, according to the terms of agreement generally exacted in the sale of State lands. Mr. Monson, the British Minister, in his last report says : \u2014 \" With regard to the adminis tration of justice, the old Spanish procedure is still generally in use, and the law's delays, proverbial in every country, are here exagge rated to an insupportably wearisome extent.

Comparing the Customs Returns made in England, France, &c, of goods exported to Uruguay, it was found in former years that they amounted sometimes to upwards of 64 per cent, more than the returns made of the corres ponding imports in Montevideo. Part of this discrepancy was attributed to contraband trade, and part to the low tariff of valuation at the Montevidean Custom House ; but the main reason was that in the statistics of Uruguay no notice was taken of the goods or produce imported and re-shipped to Buenos Aires, &c, or to Europe. Since 1877 rectifications have been made ; and it is possible that the dis cepancies in regard to the transit trade may have been exaggerated ; but from the latest official reports (1882) it does not appear that the question is yet solved.

There is also the question of freight; and there may be other minor causes of variation. The imports from Great Britain, in 1878, amount to about a third of the whole import trade ; and the exports to Great Britain amount to about one-fourth of the exports of Uruguay. The whole trade with Great Britain amounts to about three-elevenths of the total"], [146, "The Republic of Uruguay. 124 exports and imports of the country ; whereas the trade with France amounts to less than two elevenths.

That is to say, the special trade with Uruguay is in favour of Great Britain, but the special and transit trade combined show a balance in favour of France. Something in this question depends on the method of valuing articles exported in Eng land and in France. The returns of exports and imports, accord ing to the trade with each nation, are con fessedly in round numbers.

For example, in this case, Chile in particular, and the Argentine Republic in a less degree, are agricultural countries. The mere values of exports and imports are not a sufficient test of the relative consuming or producing powers of different nations. All that a nation consumes of its own produce, would absolutely tell against it, in a bald valuation of exports and imports. The more it consumed of its own produce, the less it would export ; and to a certain extent, but not in the same proportion, the less it would have occasion to import. The Collector of Customs in his Report (1881) alludes to this question, and points out that new industries have appeared, and especially in articles of clothing. But if as he states the new industries, which have been fostered by high duties, have diminished imports, the case is not the same as with the natural industries of the country. The extra cost of the articles of clothing will have to be paid for by abstention, or as a tax on the consumer in one way or another. The Collector on the other hand deplores the fact that a pastoral country like Uruguay should"], [151, "Trade and Commerce. 129 import butter and cheese, at an additional cost of at least 40 per cent., including freight, charges, and duties. This is probably a question of scarcity of labour, and ultimately of immigration ; but in this case the complaint is just, and imports of that nature might diminish with advantage. The value of the exports in 1881 was over 20 millions of dollars ; and allowing for a liberal Customs valuation in favour of the exporters, the amount may safely be calculated at 25 millions, or over 5,000,000''.

The imports in late years have not reached the figures, somewhat exceptional, of 1872 and 1873, but they show a steady general increase, and for some time the im ports exceeded the exports ; but not on that account was there any diminution in com mercial activity.

The provision trade is also a fair test of the well-being of the population of the Republic itself, and is intimately connected, as a question of exports, with the rising agricultural industries of the country. According to the Revista Mercantil of 1883, the falling off already noticed in the general imports in 1882, compared with 1881, is of more inqoortance than appears from the mere figures, which show only a trifling deficit. The value of the imported articles in cluded under the head of provisions and groceries, which in Montevideo technically comprise a few articles that are not exactly eatables and drinkables, was, in 1881, $8,648,000.

This result would be disheartening, were it not that irregularities in regard to stocks and prices of provisions arise from a very simple cause. The provision trade in Montevideo is in the hands of a few firms, generally speaking of good repute, but old-fashioned in their methods. They have been accustomed to receive their importations at certain periods corresponding with the fall in prices in the producing countries, and always in sailing vessels. The varying requirements of the"], [156, "The Republic of Uruguay. 134 Commerce and Agri cultural Industries. home market have not been considered, so that generally speaking in the provision trade it is either a feast or a famine.

This question is interest ing, as a minute illustration of great changes in commerce throughout the world, due to altered conditions, irrespective of temporary causes and of the relative values of the cur rency and of gold. The export of cereals, flour, fruits, hay, and oleaginous products, to Brazil, the West Indies, the Cape of Good Hope, and to Europe, is destined before long to be of some import ance to the Republic. At present the ex ports of agricultural produce are not of much value ; and at least three-fourths of the flour, for instance, exported from Montevideo in 1882, were in transit from Chile.

In 1829 the public debt amounted to $153,000. In 1830 it rose to $430,000. Treasury notes were issued for its redemption, and in December, 1831, it was reduced to $107,000. But during the rule of the Provisional Government under General Rondeau, in 1830, financial complications had already appeared. On the 15th February, 1834, the public debt had risen to $879,000, and in February, 1835, the Commission appointed to report on the finances of the State announced a deficit of \" the enormous sum,\" as they called it, of $1,474,625. The debt about that date had risen to $2,081,000, and the fruitful source of difficulties was in the war department, which in those days consumed 50 per cent, of the receipts of the State. Moreover, at more or less the same period, some of the loans of the Government were contracted at rates varying from 18 to 30 per cent, per annum. In 1836 the total receipts were calculated"], [161, "Public Revenue. 139 at $917,000. Of this sum, $74,000 were from Custom duties on imports. The receipts from all sources in that year very much exceeded the estimates. The financial position of the country seemed favourable, and efforts were made to redeem a portion of the public debt. From 1832 to 1836 the receipts had not much varied in amount, but from 1836 to 1842 they increased 300 per cent. Unhappily the obligations and expenditure had begun to increase at a still higher rate. In 1840 the re ceipts were $3,029,385 (old money), but the cash deficit and public debt amounted to $5,128,378 and 7 rials, as officially stated, with the remark that \" the country was at the brink of an abyss.\" Foreign complications, and particularly with the Argentine Confederation, soon began to magnify the \" supplementary \" and \" extra ordinary\" estimates of the war department; and finally came the Guerra Grande, or \"great war,\" when the country was invaded by General Oribe, by orders of the dictator of the Argentine Confederation, General Don Manuel Rosas. The ordinary resources of revenue, export"], [162, "The Republic of Uruguay. 140 and import duties, were reduced, and some of them disappeared. Tributes, forced loans, and similar devices served as the financial basis of the organisation of the defence of the besieged city of Montevideo. The interest of money in private transactions at that period was at the rates of 40, 50, 80, and even 100 per cent, per annum ! The public properties were sold at ruinous prices. The Customs revenue in 1844 and 1845 was farmed, and produced very little \u2014 something over $200,000 in each year. After the peace in 1851, the ordinary expen diture of the year was placed at $2,000,000. During the years 1852 and 1853 the country again revived. The stock of cattle began to increase, and commerce returned to its old channels. Notwithstanding internal political dissensions which quickly declared themselves, the revenue of the country in 1854 was $2,611,000, and in 1869 it had increased to six-fold the amount raised in 1829. The public debt increased likewise, and its service was at the same time gradually organised. The consolidation of the debt due to private persons for State exactions took place in 1854. In 1857 the conversion was"], [163, "Public Revenue. 141 arranged of the debt due for compensations of losses during the great war.

The creditors, represented by the Maua Bank, ceded 95 per cent, of the nominal value of the consolidated bonds, and the interest to July 1, 1859. The rate of interest on this funded debt was fixed at 6 per cent., with 1 per cent. sinking fund ; the redemption to be by tender until the bonds were at par, when it would take place by drawing. The whole debt of the State in August, 1857, was calculated at $104,639,242 (old money).

The Uruguay Loan, to the amount of $16,450,000, was negotiated in London in 1871. The history of that loan belongs to recent times. The revenue of the Republic of Uruguay is derived principally from the Customs dues. A part is derived from direct taxation on land and houses, and from stamps, stamped paper, and licenses to business houses, shops, &c.

In allusion to this reduced tariff, which was quickly abandoned, the Report of the Minister of Finance for the year 1881 says: \u2014 \"The importing trade alone benefited by the reduc tion of duties. The consumer derived no perceptible advantage. Moreover, the traders had no confidence in the measure, as they did not consider it serious or permanent, and thus kept up their old prices.

The administration of the public funds has of late years visibly im proved, and efforts are being made to perfect the system of levying Customs dues, upon which the principal portion of the national revenue depends. As the Minister observes, there are so many conflicting interests to be considered, it is no easy matter to solve at once the problems that arise in the adminis tration of the Customs. Above all it is neces sary that the Customs duties should be uniform ; and yet, as the Report states, it was not very long ago that, in the endeavour to compete with the Brazilian custom-houses, lower duties were levied on the frontier than in other parts of the Republic. The consequence was that a merchant in Paysandu would purchase his goods in Salto, where the duties were lower ;"], [166, "The Republic of Uruguay. 144 and such anomalies must occur when general principles of justice and common sense are abandoned in favour of some temporary device in the shape of differential duties. Much has been written, observes the Minister, in respect to the raising and lowering of Customs duties, and there are some impres sionable minds to which absolute free trade and even free ports offer attraction ; but these extreme views are impossible. The State must have revenues to promote public works, and after due study of the question the Minister decided in favour of raising the indirect taxes levied on imports and exports as a method of increasing the revenue with least prejudice to the consumer. Turning, however, to the Report of the Collector of Customs, we find it very dis tinctly stated as his opinion that a falling off in the imports to the amount of $2,570,380, or 12 per cent, reduction, in 1881, compared with 1880, was mostly due to the increase in the import tariff, which was raised to cover a deficit of $1,015,428, that early declared itself in the budget or estimates for 1881."], [167, "Public Revenue. 145 The latest detailed report of the receipts and expenditure is that for 1881.

In 1874 it fell to $6,509,843, and in 1875 to $4,978,715. It increased in 1876, and since that date it has risen and fallen alternately until 1880, when it was reduced to $4,409,496. The fall in 1879-1880 has been ascribed to the lowering of the import duties 50 per cent, and the export duties 25 per cent. Of the beneficial effects of the low export duties, which were reduced to 6 per cent, on produce in general, there is no doubt. The import duties in 1880 on merchandise in general, but with many exceptions, were 25 per cent, on the valuation.

In raising the duties it is thought that the Government of Uruguay was imitating the example of the United States, and pursuing a protectionist policy ; but if a duty of 37 per cent, is in some senses prohibitive, and more than protectionist, it is obvious that there is no similarity in the industrial position of the Republic of Uruguay compared with that of the United States.

A glance at the analysis of ex penditure given above, where, out of a revenue of eight millions more or less, four millions, including military requirements, are ample for the ordinary expenses of the Government, it is plain that the evil is the yearly burden of interest on debts, the accumulation of which in Uruguay, as in many larger countries, has been encouraged by the fatal facilities of indirect taxation. In regard to the Public Debt, the Minister of Finance says in his report : \u2014 \" Entering into other details of the adminis tration, the most important question to notice is the conversion by a Redeemable Debt of those claims anterior to 1879, which, accord ing to law, were in a position to be converted. \"The magnitude of that operation has entailed great labour on the department of the Accountant-General, as it involved the verifi cation of innumerable claims extending over a number of years, and constituting what is called the ' Floating Debt.'

The width of the dock is 17 metres at the level of the quays, and 12 metres below. At low tide there is about 16 feet of water, and at high tide about 19. The entrance is easy, and protected from the south-west winds by a natural reef as well as by a well-constructed breakwater. For the last twelve years, since 1871, the City of Montevideo has been abundantly sup plied with water of remarkable purity, com pared with the supplies of several large cities in Great Britain. The works are situated on the River Santa Lucia, near a village of the same name, about 33 miles from Montevideo. They are due to private enterprise, and were until lately the property of Messrs. Lezica, Lanuz, & Fynn, by whom they were initiated. They are now the property of a London company. The works were planned and constructed by the English engineer, Mr. Frederick Newman.
