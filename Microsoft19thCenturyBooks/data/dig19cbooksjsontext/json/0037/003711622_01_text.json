Sir \u2014 The act of Congress, \" concerning navigation,\" hereto an nexed, which is to take effect the first day of October next, so ma terially changes the commerce of the United States with the colonies and territories of his Britannic Majesty, that a due regard to the convenience and interest of those engaged in it, requires that the construction of the act should at this time be determined. According to the term used under the first section of the act, every port or place in the British colonies and territories in the West Indies, and on the continent of America, must be considered as closed against vessels of the United States to which they are not by act of Parliament permitted to carry on the same trade, both in exports and imports, which is now, or shall be, carried on in Bri tish vessels between the ports of the United States and the ports of any British colony or territory. * The permissions by act of Parliament to the vessels of the United States to go jn ballast to Turks Island and bring away salt, or to carry certain articles to one or more of the Bahama Islands, ana\" bring away salt, and a few other articles, cannot be considered as opening the ports of those Islands to the vessels of the United States, according to the intention of the act of Congress, whilst British vessels are permitted to carry on the same trade in articles prohibi ted to vessels of the United States."], [30, "29 It may be proper to observe, that the prohibition in the first sec tion applies equally to vessels whether in ballast or with cargoes. The form of the bond required by the second section of the act is hereunto annexed. It is expected that proper circumspection will be exercised in requiring security, as much of the efficacy of the act will depend upon the judicious discharge of this part of your duty.
