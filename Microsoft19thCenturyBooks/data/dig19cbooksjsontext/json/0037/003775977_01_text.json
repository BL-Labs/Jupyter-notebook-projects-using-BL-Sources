CHAPTER I. \" I TOLD YOU SO !\" On the banks of the Thames, a few miles above Oxford, stands a small toAvn, which Ave -will call Merton. There are feAv specialities to distinguish Merton from fifty other quiet inland toAvns. There is a sine old church, and the ruins of an ancient castle occasionally brings the aptiquary into the neigh bourhood, but the church is decidedly the main feature of interest at Merton. n VOL I."], [10, "2 MARTYRS TO FASHION. It was at the time Avhen Ritualism sirst began to be talked of, and the Merton Clergyman was suspected of an inclination in that direction. But the presence of a gaunt Wesley an Chapel, which seemed with its heavy ugly front as if it were froAvning down the pomps and vanities of Aveak-minded High Churchmen, had no doubt some effect in subduing the aspirations of the Rev. Albert Chekker. The stranger at Merton could obtain an excellent clue to the state of religious feeling by looking into the church or chapel alternately. For no sooner does the Rev. Albert Chekker find a soothing calm settling over the minds of the Wesleyan flock than he introduces innovations into his seryiee. Imme diately some good-natured friend writes to the Merton Chronicle, and a leading"], [11, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 3 article appears next day Avith dark hints of Rome and Martyrs at Smith field, and on the folloAving Sunday there is a re-action in favour of dissent. Zion Chapel is filled, and poor Mr. Chekker, warned in time, gives way to the prejudices of the Mertonians. On one point he still remains firm, however. He has a passionate love of music. An anthem, combined Avith a rou2?h imitation of a Cathedral Service, forms a standing dish, and also it must be confessed a standing attraction at the old church. And it must be said, too, that the Anthem Avas passably Avell done, for George Harland, the timber merchant, had a very SAveet tenor voice, and could sin\"' both in time and in tune, not to mention also that his brother Gilbert's full deep bass, which was b2"], [12, "4 MARTYRS TO FASHION. free from that hard metallic tone Avhich makes so many bass voices grievous to listen to, chimed in ad- mirably as the foundation upon which the vocal super-structure Avas raised. The soprano voice you could not find fault with as regarded quality, though it possessed no great poAver. Its owner Avas Annie Warren, whose father, Michael Warren, kept the Mount Earm. Her bird-like tones floated sAveetly through the Gothic aisles, and it vvas a point of honour with Gilbert and George Harland ne\\rer to sing too loud so as to distress her, for Annie was a SAveet delicate fragile thing, a floAver likely to expand to great beauty in a genial atmosphere, but a flower which those Avho loved would desire to shelter from any rude blast of care or disappointment."], [13, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 5 A very different temperament Avas that of Caroline Sandall, Avho sang the contralto part. She Avas bent upon being heard and invariably sang her loudest. Annie Warren, enthusiastic and full of love and reverence, thought only of doing her best to fonvard the Avorship and praise of her Creator. Caroline thought only of half a dozen young men in the church, who would listen and mentally applaud her solo. With these slight indications of character to guide us, and remembering that it was on a week-day that our story opens, Ave invite the reader to the banks of the river, where stood a quaint picturesque timber yard, Avith a huge board in the form of an arch at the entrance, to inform the world that Messrs. Harland and Sons carried on business there. The firm consisted"], [14, "6 MARTYRS TO FASHION. of the WidoAv Harland and her sons Gilbert and George, the tAvo sons living with their mother in a snug cottage adjoining the wharf. There was a marked contrast between the brothers. Gilbert, the eldest, was a tall muscular felloAv, Avhose help when a heavy log of timber stuck fast was generally counted on by his workmen to turn the scale. His hair Avas crisp and dark, his eyes keen and piercing. There Avas little delicacy in his features, which, however, were sufficiently regular to produce a very harmonious effect when his face was lighted up by any pleasurable thought or impulse. There Avas an air of firmness and decision which at once led the stranger to him as the person most likely to have authority. George Avas not unlike his brother"], [15, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 7 in features, but the expression Avas altogether of a milder cast. What Gilbert Avould insist upon George Avould suggest\u2014 Avhere Gilbert enquired George trusted \u2014 Avhere Gilbert looked for second motives George accepted Avithout ques tion. He Avas often imposed upon but rarely exhibited any impatience, ahvays blaming himself for being the A'ictim of his too easy confidence. To return to the Avharf. It was a Avarm day, and a barge had just been moored at the little quay beloAV the wharf, which caused some activity, and also no little grumbling from old Kebble the foreman, whose idea was that you could never get men to work Avithout finding fault with them every five minutes. He was privileged to say and do almost what he pleased, for as he"], [16, "8 MARTYRS TO FASHION. often remarked, \" He hadn't helped to build the wharf sheds forty years ago without knowing what ought to be done now.\" He would as readily grumble at George Harland as at any of the men, but with Gilbert he ahvays observed a certain deference. George was sitting on a log of timber in a thoughtful mood Avhen the barge arrived. \" Come, Mr. George, we Avant your help,\" said Kebble, \"you'll never make your fortune sitting dreaming there on a log about that young singing girl.\" \"What singing girl is that,\" asked George, laughing-. \"Oh, you know all about it,\" Kebble answered, \" but mind what you're about, or you'll be deceived. Them sinrin\" girls are precious artful with their church-going, and what not.\""], [17, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 9 \" You ought to go to church, Kebble, yourself, instead of smoking your pipe all day on Sunday. Perhaps after a time you might get a taste for music.\" \" As to church, Master George, there's them as it suits, and them as it don't. I'm one of the latter sort. What I grumble at is that men like Chekker don't understand anything about practical life. What does a single young chap like him know about the trials and troubles of men that have to battle Avith the Avorld and keep wives and families. He comes here from college after reading the Fathers and Divines, and Avhen they give him a babby to christen, Lord if he ain't afear'd of the poor little thing, as though it Avas something that might tumble to pieces. What does a chap like him"], [18, "10 MARTYRS TO FASHION. knoAv of the terrible thoughts a man has on his death-bed, looking back upon a life spent mostly in the Devil's Avork. If Chekker could have his way, he'd smooth it all over by crossing the poor Avretch Avith holy water, and making him believe that wafers was spiritual life, and that consecrated Avine Avashed out evil recollections.\" \" What has that to do Avith Miss Sandall, Kebble?\" \" Very true, Master George, and here I'm jaAving away Avhen the lads are wanting my help. Come, and lend a hand, will you ?\" George went down to the landing place, and pulled and hauled with thorough good-Avill at the huge pine logs, assisted by three workmen, one of whom, named Samson, was indeed worthy of his name, and had never"], [19, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 11 been knoAvn to stagger under any burden they chose to place upon his shoulders. It must not be supposed because of George's readiness to do a turn of rough hard work that he had little taste or cultivation. On the contrary, he Avas accomplished in many ways. His musical skill Avas considerable, and he had a very creditable knoAvledge of draw ing. This taste he had cultivated under Caroline Sandall' s father, but like many avIio have considerable natural faculty, he Avas contented Avith producing imme diate effects, and rarely elaborated any sketch into a finished picture. The work of the wharf was concluded as the afternoon declined, and Gilbert, who had been in the counting-house making some elaborate calculations, came out and spoke to George."], [20, "12 MARTYRS TO FASHION. \" Which Avay do you go to-night, George, I Avanted to send a little note to Warren's, if you are passing that way.\" \"Oh, I'll take it of course,\" said the good-natured George, though he Avas in reality going in quite a con trary direction. \"No, no, George,\" said his brother, \" you are not going that way, I see. I'll call myself \u2014 shall you go to the music class ?\" \"Well, no, Gilbert, I think not. Old Sandall is sketching the manor for Sir Charles, and it's not unlikely that I may run up for an hour. It is to be a sunset vieAv, the baronet said, and I should like to see how he gets the effect.\" \"I suppose Caroline will assist also,\" said Gilbert, laughing."], [21, "I TOLD Y'OU SO ! 13 \" It's just possible,\" George answered with a shy smile. \" Weil then, George, I certainly won't inflict you with mv note, for I'll <zo myself, and maybe take a cup of tea with\u2014\" \" With Annie,\" George retorted, fill ing up the sentence. So the brothers parted for the day, and George Avent in to get some tea with his mother. He was more reser ved than usual, for he kneAv that Caroline Sandall was no great favorite Avith the old lady, and whenever he was likely to see her, the pleasure was usually qualified by some sug gestive remarks beforehand from Mrs. Harland, which, however good humoredly George might receive them, generally damped his ardour a little. So when tea was finished, and George"], [22, "14 MARTYRS TO FASHION. began to fumble about with a portfolio of Avater colour sketches, she said, \" I don't wish to interfere, George, with any of your plans, but I do hope you'll be careful and not make up your mind about that young Avoman till you know more of her.\" \" Why mother, havn't I knoAvn her these three years. Ever since they came to live in our neighbourhood. I know her as Avell as her OAvn father.\" \" My dear, you don't allow for the great changes that take place in a young girl's character at that age. Circum stances that Avouldn't have any effect upon the lives of a man or woman of forty, make Avonderful changes for good or evil in young folks of twenty.\" \" Pray don't be so timid, mother. If I can win Caroline Sandall, I feel confident I shall knoAv Iioav to take care of her.\""], [23, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 15 Mrs. Harland slightly shook her head, but George giving her a kiss, and tel ling her he would not be late, Avent merrily off to the trysting place. His mother, far from confident of the future, watched him till a bend of the road hid him from her sight. George walked gaily along, thinking of many things he Avished to say to Caroline, and Avondering Iioav she would receive him, for he could not conceal from himself, though he would not admit it to his mother, that Caroline Avas an extremely capricious beauty. He could never depend when he left her one day Avhat would be her mood upon the next occasion of their meeting. Sometimes she Avas gay as a lark, seem ing full of unconscious happiness, Avith not a thought, hope, or feeling beyond the moment, and probably, after going"], [24, "16 MARTYRS TO FASHION. home from such a meeting, with his mind filled Avith delicious dreams, he would have the mortification on the next day, of finding that nothing he said or did pleased her \u2014 that his pretty compliments met Avith rebuffs, Avhich Avere almost mde\u2014 when if he opened the piano to try a duet with her, she would petulantly put her fingers in her ears, and pretend that he Avas singing out of tune. George Avas as good tem pered a fellow as need be, but musical amateurs, as some of my readers well knoAV, cannot stand being twitted about their intonation. Then it may be, George Avould show some drawing or water-colour sketch he had taken un usual pains with, and Caroline, who at other times would have lauded it to the skies, noAv picked out the one faulty bit, and persisted in not seeing anything else."], [25, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 17 At such times, if George sat down and appeared tired, she would rate him for not proposing a walk. If he sug- gested Avalking of his own accord, she would be gone an hour to put on her bonnet. If he looked at his watch as a gentle reminder of the time she had been, off went the bonnet and shawl, and down she Avould sit at the piano for the rest of the evening, no matter if the sunset was the finest of the whole summer, and George she knew was dying to watch it sink from some distant hill. If George asked for a song, she would probably be seized with a fit of coughing. Still, we know what men will submit to, from some women, and George, though remembering bitterly the gra cious manner in which the perverse beauty had received him the day before, VOL I. c"], [26, "18 MARTYRS TO FASHION. would labour to overcome these unfor tunate moods, but rarely with success. It was a lovely evening as George hastened to the spot where he expected to find the artist, and hoped also to see Caroline. The birds seemed chanting a love carol, the soft summer wind breathed delicious secrets into his ear, and the sweet odours of the hedgerows were more than usually grateful. Eull of delightful anticipations, he walked gaily on till he reached a stile where a footpath crossed the lane and led through some fields to Merton Manor, the substantial Eliza bethan mansion of Sir Charles Sinclair, who had lately come into possession of the property, and was as liberal and popular as young men generally are who inherit fine estates upon coming of age. Having made the discovery that he had an unrecognized genius on the"], [27, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 19 estate, the young baronet sought him out, and for years Sandall had not met with such a good customer. At this spot George stopped for a moment. Fields and meadoAVS were stretched out before him, and peeping here and there through the lofty trees shimmered the silvery winding Thames. Upon a distant hill the Avindmill slug gishly heaved its flapping wings like a huge bird fatigued with its flight over some mighty ocean. In the distance rose the hoary spire of Merton Church Avith its weathercock shining in the light of the declining sun, like a curiously shaped star. George Avas an artist in feeling, and had a great deal of undeveloped poetry in his nature. It was a scene to inspire him, but at that moment he leaped the stile Avith the greatest eagerness, for on a rising c 2"], [28, "20 MARTYRS TO FASHION. ground, in the shade of a fine old oak, he detected the corner of the artist's canvas, and congratulating himself upon finding Sandall there, and most likely Caroline with him, made at once for the spot. The man Avho sat there sketching Merton Manor Avas an artist of fine abilities, broken doAvn in the prime of life, and made prematurely old through self-indulgence, and disappointment. He had studied hard in his younger days, having exhibited works which critics praised, and visitors had admired. If an artist could have existed upon critical admiration and friendly sympathy, Charles Sandall might not have become disgusted with his profession, but unfor tunately his pictures never sold. His friends endeavoured to console him by telling him that he was a far"], [29, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 21 greater man than many whose works sold readily at a high price, still Charles Sandall found life no easier. Wearied out at last, he took a little cottage a Merton, where his mother had lived in her youth, and there he secluded himself from his former associates, Avith his wife and child, and Avorked hard to realize the dream of his life. So hard, indeed, that he quite overlooked the fact that his young Avife Avas rapidly pining aAvay through disappointment and privation. At length, the work Avhich was to immortalize him was finished, and sent off to London. He waited for the gallery to open with great hopes, and a throbbing heart. It was possible that the wheel of fortune might be turned by some unseen hand, and fate might bring him one prize yet, in the lottery of life."], [30, "22 MARTYRS TO FASHION. But, as before, the critics said the \" work was full of promise,\" and many visitors stopped daily to gaze upon it. \" Gad, it's a devilish good thing,\" said Lord Mumville, \" but not a subject for a private gallery, eh Spottley ? \" \" Certainly not my Lord,\" the picture dealer replied, \"the thing is quite unsaleable. Great pity some one doesn't put Charles Sandall on the right track. This sort of thing won't go doAvn.\" So the man who could not lend him self to the taste of the moment \u2014 could not paint street mobs, processions, or state ceremonials \u2014 Avho would not content himself with the intricacies of a satin dress or the folds of a mantle, the hue of a peach, or the laziness of a lap dog, was neglected by the public and soon forgotten. When poor Sandall' s unlucky picture"], [31, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 23 came back, his Avife was dying. The artist hoping little and fearing much, had for the first time in his life been drinking freely. Staggering home, he overtook the one porter from the rail way station, at Merton, with a bulky looking package upon his shoulder, and kneAv immediately what it was. He folloAved the man to the cottage, gave him a trifle, and threw the returned landscape into his rude studio, where it lay for months ere the artist had courage to take off the Avrappings that covered it. It seemed useless to paint for fame, but he must live. So with easily achieved \" pot-boilers,\" hastily made up from the outlines of common photographs, or odd sketches he had once intended for elaborate pictures, poor Sandall scraped up -a living ; but all force of character,"], [32, "24 MARTYRS TO FASHION. all pleasure in work was gone. The boundary line once passed that separated self-respect from recklessness, he fell rapidly into dissolute habits, and when he could earn sufficient to procure the means of forgetfulness, was rarely sober. Soon his wife died, and then the unluckly artist seemed smitten with something like remorse, and petted and spoiled his little daughter, as though to compensate for the harsh fate of her mother. Working harder he contrived to find a ready market for common-place little domestic daubs, and also to gain some pupils. One of these pupils, as we have before hinted, was George Harland. During the whole time of Sandall' s residence at Merton, George had been a frequent visitor, first, as a lover of art, and then of Caroline Sandall."], [33, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 25 It cannot be said that this acquaintance promised much. Caroline had been indulged by her heedless shambling father Avithout much consideration for her age or sex. Charles Sandall was ready at all times to act in defiance of the world and its usages, and as a matter of course he paid the penalty of his temerity. Caroline had become as indifferent as her father, to the Avorld's praise or blame. Caroline had few if any friends among her own sex. Annie Warren was frank and genial, being bound by the mystical tie of sweet sounds, but they were not intimate. George fre quently heard disparaging remarks about her, but men will hear a thousand ugly things said of a pretty woman, and like her all the better, and those who were readiest to decry her were the readiest"], [34, "26 MARTYRS TO FASHION. also to bask in her smiles Avhen she chose to be gracious to them. Many young fellows had buzzed and fluttered about her Avithout seeming to advance themselves in her favour. Not one could lay the flattering unction to his soul that he Avas favoured above the rest. In fact, she was a complete and accomplished coquette. She had become as accustomed to meaningless compliments from the men who hovered about her, as the actress to Avhom the glare of the footlights and the clap pings of the gallery are as the breath of life. There seemed no prospect of her inspiring a genuine affection Avhich would have redeemed and elevated her character. A fresh conquest was her highest aim. Her mirror \u2014 (a cracked one by-the-by, for the Sandall house hold was not resplendent) \u2014 told her that"], [35, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 27 she was beautiful, and nineteen is an age when even the purest and SAveetest of the sex are prone to make a little fun of our masculine worship. So Caroline's lovers increased, and the greater pains they took to supplant each other in paying her homage the better she was pleased. She Avas an accom plished young actress, with the draAving room for a stage. She could play upon a passion or feeling like a finished performer on a delicate instrument. She was quick to detect peculiarities of character, apt in retort, and notAvith standing their poverty, ahvays contrived to avail herself of every little art and trick of fashion. There were many of her OAvn sex who envied her the readiness with which she fascinated all who came within the magic circle of her influence, avIio,"], [36, "28 MARTYRS TO FASHION. if they could have learned her secret might have used it to better purpose. Love is blind, or love might have seen that Caroline was like a bale of merchandise going to the highest bidder. George, greatly envied by a host of admirers, had been throAvn much into her society. He had entered an enchan ted land, of which he believed himself the monarch. She had praised his sketches, and listened to his singing. Not one man in a thousand but can be conquered by his vanity if in no other way. Very fine young fellows, who pride themselves upon knoAving a thing or two, are frequently caught with no other bait than this. George, of course, could not believe that any other swain was equally favoured. \" Her free and lively manners were taken by silly young men, as tokens"], [37, "I TOLD YOU SO ! 29 of encouragement she never intended. Caroline a coquette ? \" His mother must be grievously mistaken,\" thought George, and wished the old lady could have seen her modest tender glances when they last met. \" Oh ! Caroline was an angel, there was not the slightest doubt about it.\" When George had ventured upon one occasion to question the propriety of so much attention being shown her, Caroline had said, \"You are too exacting, Mr. Harland, I cannot imagine much harm Avill come from my amusing myself Avith these foolish young fellows ; but don't suppose, George, I am insensible to the attentions of a man of talent and character.\" We left George making his way to the spot where Sandall was sketching. The path ran through some brushwood."], [38, "30 MARTYRS TO FASniON. and beneath a hedge, so that George could not be seen till he came to the point where Sandall was. As he came nearer he heard voices, which he soon discovered to be those of the artist and his daughter. They Avere speaking in an undertone, but George, hearing his own name men tioned, stopped, as Avhat young lover under the circumstances would not, although I believe it to be the first time in his life that he had played the part of an eavesdropper. \" How continually you are finding fault with me, dad,\" were the first words he heard. \" What I fear is,\" said her father, \"that between too many stools you will fall to the ground.

Yet, spite of these advantages, he Avas not a prosperous man. When rent day came he was never ready, being frequently obliged to sell stock at a sacrifice. He managed the farm with considerable skill, and his crops Avere often better than those of his neighbours, yet he was continu ally in difficulties. The cause of this Avas clear enough to all who visited the Mount Farm. It was seen that Mr. Warren's home expenditure was far beyond legitimate proportions. His excessive fondness for display Avas exhibited in every detail of domestic life. No ordinary tea-drinking or social gathering ever took place without some fancied want being discovered, and made the excuse"], [48, "40 MARTYRS TO FASniON. for an inroad on bis purse. One ('ay, their neighbour, Mrs. Compton, from the paper mill, and her two daughters Avould drop in, and invite them to' a little musical party, and he would remember that Mrs. Compton, having just returned from Paris, Avould be up in the latest fashions. His Avife and daughter should not be thrown into the shade by that stuck-up proud Avoman. He must put the mare into the gig, and run into Oxford at once for neAv dresses. The fact that Mrs. Compton had a thousand a year in her OAvn right Avhen she married, he never took into account.

If Warren's horse could not keep up with that of his rival"], [49, "41 THE MOUNT FARM. it would not be many days before the animal was sold, probably for less than its value.

Perhaps something of that weakness of character, which at times exposed her mother to ridicule, clung to Annie, but it was hidden, redeemed, and counter balanced in a thousand Avays.

From a lovely and amiable child, she had suddenly developed into a woman of an intelligence and com prehension that utterly astonished him. She was as sensitive to beauty also as a leaf to the changes of the wind. She was touched to pleasure or pain as swiftly and as keenly as a child.

In after years and in other scenes how vividly the picture of those days would come back to Arthur's memory. How well he then remembered her delight in the river, with the beautiful woods that overhung it, and which were the pride of Merton. Sometimes he would be almost alarmed by the dreamy glances of her eyes, as she listened to the mys terious chant of the wind through the heavy foliage, and feared it was some unfavourable symptom of her late disease, and would be dissatisfied till he had roused her from her reverie, and enticed her for a stroll through pleasant fields, or beguiled her with come cheerful passage from a new book, as much opposed as possible to her previous mood. And this companionship Avas something"], [62, "54 MARTYRS TO FASHION. more to Arthur than the amusement of an idle hour. It was life, courage, inspiration to him.

It was with a feeling almost akin to pity, that many friends of the Warren's remarked Annie's accomplish ments and graceful manners. The straits in which her father often found himself, in his endeavours to keep pace with his wealthier neighbours, were only too well known, yet Michael Warren declared that his daughter should never marry a farmer or a tradesman. She had spent several years at an expensive boarding-school, were languages and deportment were made much of, where dressing the hair in the latest mode was almost an article of religion, where the hundred and one exercises of Czerny pressed heavily upon the youthful soul, and numbed the youthful fingers, where the laws"], [64, "56 MARTYRS TO FASHION. of etiquette were as familiar as sleeping and waking. Annie, however, returned from this educational forcing-house as gentle and simple-minded as ever. Seeds of vanity and luxuriousness had doubtless been sown by this high pressure system, but the simplicity and purity of her nature had repelled them. If sometimes there appeared indications which too plainly revealed the faults of her training, they were forgotten and forgiven, especially by the other sex, in the charm and piquancy given to her appearance and conversation. Even those who smiled at the man agement of the Mount Farm household, could not help confessing that her smattering of languages, her fancifully embroidered cushions and slippers, her piano fantasias, her crochet work"], [65, "57 THE MOUNT FARM. imitation floAvers, and so forth, though as Compton, the paper maker, said, roughly, \" no more fitted to her position than a silk purse to a sow's ear,\" yet somehow gave a pleasant tone to the Mount Farm, and brought visitors there who were delighted with her, and not a few of the Mertonian youths, who would gladly have welcomed any encouragement from her. From childhood the Warren's had been intimate with the Harlands, and it was understood by many that a feeling warmer than friendship had sprung up between Gilbert Harland and Annie. People said it was a sensible match, for Gilbert's partnership in the timber yard produced a certain and sufficient income. He was a manly fellow, fond of books and study, but practical and energetic, and with an"], [66, "58 MARTYRS TO FASHION. evident desire to advance himself. There was, however, a vein of romance in his nature, which few would have given him credit for, and it had been the province of Annie Warren to draAv out this golden thread from the woof of his plain and honest nature. Gilbert's admiration and reverence for womanhood, amounted almost to positive worship.

Something of that fatal poison, with which Fashion drugs her votaries, may have crept into her mind, and brought with it delusive visions of a future, tinged with grace beyond the possibilities of Mertonian surroundings. The frequent visits of Gilbert Harland, were of course not unobserved by Michael Warren, but he was in no haste to discountenance a wooer who could so easily be kept in hand, and who, if no loftier suitor should appear, might eventually be tolerated. In the mean time affairs suddenly brightened at Mount Farm \u2014 A bachelor relative of Mr. Warren's, who had been grubbing all his life, in a dirty lane at Whitechapel, died suddenly.

This, it had been his sole aim to increase, for what purpose was never known. Enough for us, is, that Michael Warren was next of kin, and inherited the savings of his dull existence. As may be supposed, the possession of this little property did not weaken Mr. Warren's ambition. Conscious that the associations of early life, and his want of education, could not now be overcome, he determined to shine in a reflected light, by securing brilliant positions for his children. How he over-stepped the boundaries of common sense may readily be imagined, in sup posing a few thousands would realize such an ideal as he coveted.

This young gentle man being a bachelor, conjured up in Warren's mind, the possibility of a distinguished alliance for Annie. This flattering idea became almost a mono mania with him. The nods, winks, and wreathed smiles he indulged in when the baronet's name was mentioned, quite mystified the Mertonians. Sometimes a vague idea might strike him, how he would comport himself in aristocratic saloons, but his confidence was rarely shaken for many minutes. He was not quite at ease about Gilbert Harland. He felt that it was just possible Gilbert might resent the idea of calmly giving up Annie, and even"], [70, "62 MARTYRS TO FASHION. Annie herself, he knew was not insen- sible to the warmth and genuineness of the young man's passion. Upon one occasion, when Avith a vieAV of ascertaining her feelings, he had spoken disparagingly of Gilbert, Annie had defended him almost with the tears in her eyes. That Gilbert would eventually marry Annie, seemed to have been taken for granted by the Harlands themselves, and the change in Mr. Warren's manner, in consequence of his improved position, together with his coolness to Gilbert, when they met, had not passed unnoticed at the timber-yard. Even, Kebble the foreman, satirical as usual, said, when he saw the farmer pass through Merton \u2014 \"I don't know what's coming to Michael Warren.

No one had seen the mishap, but by the most fortunate chance, Gilbert passed near as she sank, and noticed a strange commotion in the usually placid surface of the mill-dam.

He plunged in"], [73, "65 THE MOUNT FARM. and soon brought the exhausted girl to the surface.

His kindly solicitude had aAvakened in her mind the first daAvnings of a sincere affection. At that age there Avas something too romantic in the circumstance itself not to have its full effect upon an imaginative and sensitive temperament. Michael Warren was willing now, if not to forget, at least, to set aside, the fact that any special debt of gratitude bound him to give his daughter to the man who bad saved her.

Few of the farm people were more surprised at the outward change in their master than Job Cruppy, a lazy comical felloAV, who had been a hanger on at the farm ever since boyhood. The amount of work done by Cruppy was almost valueless, but at rare intervals he would conquer his habitual indolence and help a little in the hay-field, or saunter into Oxford on some trifling errand for Annie or Arthur, not forgetting to stop and rest at a great many wayside hostels during the journey. Cruppy was not a man to trouble himself much about outward changes. With a keen sense of the ridiculous, he was yet too good a judge of his own interest to display it. He was seated"], [79, "71 FINE FEATHERS MAKE FINE BIRDS. at the kitchen tea-table with a huge bason of tea before him, which he did not sip daintily as some delicate ladies do, but took it off as nervous people do an unpleasant potion or black draught. Then he cut himself a slice of bacon and laid it on a piece of bread, and another bit of bread on the bacon, Avhich he called a \"thumb bit.\" Then he began cutting round and round this little island of a thumb bit Avith his pocket knife, till at last thumb bit and all disappeared, and thus ended his meal, much more to his own satisfaction than that of Mrs. Higgins the housekeeper, who constantly protested against his indolence and greediness. Mr. Warren was accustomed to take Cruppy with him in going about the farm. It gave him a look of authority Avhich was eminently gratifying to his"], [80, "72 MARTYRS TO FASHION. pride. It Avas pleasant to give Cruppy instructions upon this thing and upon that, and to hear the deferential remarks of his henchman, who would probably forget half the orders given, and pur posely omit to execute the remainder. Cruppy had just finished tea as his master called him, and thrusting his tongue into his cheek in order that he might not laugh outright, the pair went out together. Mr. Warren was evidently not quite at ease in his smart apparel, and said to his retainer when they were away from the house, \" Did you say, Cruppy, that the baronet's clothes were like these ?\" \"Oh exactly, master,\" \u2014 (Cruppy, if the truth must be told, had not seen the baronet, except on the merry-making day, when he came of age). \"Well then, I should like to knoAv"], [81, "73 FINE FEATHERS MAKE FINE BIRDS.

One raised his hat with mock reverence to the farmer, while another made no attempt to conceal his mirth, but laughed in Warren's face. A wink from Cruppy behind his master's back, aggravated, rather than allayed the merriment which seemed infectious ; for they had not proceeded many yards further ere the Merton brewer passed them and imitated Mr. Warren's majestic strut so comically that poor Cruppy had the greatest difficulty in keeping his countenance.

The surroundings of the farm-house, Avhich at times, seemed to her common place, and with small claim to fashion, yet had the effect of enhancing her great beauty.

But the dravving was not a bad one of its class, and Sir Charles and the Captain Avere loud in their admiration. Annie was quite beAvildered betAveen the lavish praise of their visitors and her father's persistent arraying of her accomplishments.

As to his wife, (I had almost forgotten to mention that she was in the room) she had scarcely spoken a word. An occasional simper, in reply to her visitors, alone revealed the fact of her presence.

He narrated some amusing incidents of the parties, fetes, and picnics at which he had assisted. He spoke in glowing language of the brilliant people he"], [102, "94 MARTYRS TO FASHION. had met. In fact, he knew from experience how to engage her attention. He spoke with increased animation, and with so much warmth and freedom, that the timid girl Avas carried away by it. \"By jove, Mellor, you are keeping your fair listener all to yourself. Be very careful of that gentleman, I pray, Miss Warren, he's a frightful fellow amongst the ladies.\" The words thus spoken had the effect of recalling Annie from the dream into Avhich she had fallen, and it was with a feeling someAvhat akin to shame, that she remembered in a moment what Gilbert wrould think of her boldness, for if truth must be told, some of the Captain's details, if faithful, did not imply any fastidious delicacy amongst those who moved in the great world."], [103, "95 ANNIE AT HOME. The captain was standing near Annie, looking down upon her graceful figure Avith anything but modest glances, when the baronet spoke. Sir Charles had watched him, and with that instinctive reverence for female beauty, which has seldom evaporated at twenty two, desired to interpose some check to the freedom of his language. The captain was not too well pleased at the baronet's interruption, especially as at the same moment he saw the round red face of Cruppy leering at him through the half-opened doorway. \" What the devil does that fellow want,\" asked the Captain. \" Who's there,\" said Mr. Warren, \" that you, Cruppy ? go about your business this instant, sir.\" \"No offence, master, could I say a word ?\""], [104, "96 MARTYRS TO FASHION. \" Confound you, be off quickly,\" said his master, wondering in his heart what Cruppy could have to say just noAV, but indignant at his familiarity in presence of such distinguished company. And now, Captain Mellor, who had a fine tenor voice, being pressed by Sir Charles, sang a neAv song, and Annie made an attempt at accompany ing him. She succeeded pretty well, but had been made a little nervous during the progress of the song, by fancying she had seen Gilbert standing beneath the window. She, however, concluded that it must have been a mistake, or why did he not come in. It Avas really Gilbert who had been listening to the song, and feeling in anything but a genial mood toward the singer, and who now entered the kitchen, where Cruppy sat."], [105, "ANNIE AT HOME. 97 \" Company here, Cruppy, eh ?\" said the young man. Cruppy shrugged his shoulders, but said nothing, while Gilbert sat doAvn upon the settle, and waited till the refrain of the melody died aAvay. As he sat there moody and discon tented, as lovers generally are when the first taint of jealousy creeps over the mind, Cruppy watched him with some degree of interest ; and in truth Gilbert was a person whose appearance was not to be despised either by man or woman. He Avas plainly dressed, with a felt hat on his head, having but just left the timber yard, but he was scrupulously clean, and there was an air of intelligence and refinement about him which no manual labour could obliterate.

In this, however, he was mistaken. Few men were less likely than Gilbert Harland to be abashed by fine company. He was merely waiting with native politeness (such as needs no code of etiquette, but only kindly deference to the tastes and pursuits of others), till the song was concluded, when, rising from his seat and tapping gently at the drawing room door, he entered. Sir Charles and the Captain looked up carelessly, while Mr. Warren, far from delighted at the intrusion, mut tered some unintelligible phrase, which did not sound like a blessing, while Annie, not without a certain diffidence, spoke a few words, half of welcome,"], [107, "ANNIE AT HOME. 99 half of apology, and rose from the piano. It need hardly be said that Gilbert found himself something like a discord in the harmony. Perhaps he was the most self-possessed of the little party. He came as an honourable suitor to Annie, having no reason to be ashamed either of the object of his choice or of his own desire to win her. Affecting not to perceive that he was the one too many of the party, Gilbert looked at Annie meaningly, and his glance was returned by a frank and kindly smile of welcome as she said \u2014 \"Gilbert will take a glass of wine with us, father.\" \"He had better help himself,\" said Mr. Warren, in an extremely sulky tone. \"Thank you, Mr. Warren, I rarely drink wine.

It is more suited for the gentry than for working people.\" Gilbert reddened a little at the rudeness of this speech, but the speaker was the father of the girl he loved best in the world, so he let it pass Avithout comment, and quietly took a chair nearer to Annie, Mr. Warren, with his glass on the way to his lips, paused a moment, as though he would have prevented this, but hardly knowing whether it might not lead to a scene, refrained. \" Have you had any sport, gentlemen ?\" asked Gilbert, seeing the baronet's gun in a corner of the room. \"Passable,\" answered the Captain, thinking to himself all the while \" who the devil are you, and what do you"], [109, "101 ANNIE AT HOME. knoAV about sport,\" and Avondering also, at the decided tone Gilbert adopted Avhen he spoke once or tAvice to Annie. The Captain had just that feeling toAvards Gilbert, which he Avould have displayed to any man who came betAveen him and a flirtation with a pretty girl. He felt that he could not pursue the lively rattling talk he had been engaged in before Gilbert came. While Gilbert saw at once, that there Avas a something in the tone adopted by the man of fashion, which Avas not improving to the ear or the mind of a pure and inexperienced girl. Mr. Warren, though a little muddled Avith the wine he had been drinking, had sufficient tact to keep Gilbert in the back ground without drawing especial attention to him. At length, unable to keep down his bitterness, he said Avith mock hospitality \u2014"], [110, "102 MARTYRS TO FASHION. \"You don't seem easy, Mr. Harland, make yourself at home man. You can pull solemn faces in the timber yard, but when you get amongst your betters you should brighten up a bit.\" Still Gilbert did not retort, Captain Mellor, who had been watching him, saw plainly, that for some reason the young man could not very well assert himself, and took advantage of it, to reneAv his attentions to Annie. At his suggestion she played and sang, wonder ing all the time Avhy Gilbert was so silent and gloomy. In truth, the little flatteries of the Captain did render Gilbert's expression of face anything but genial, for he felt how delighted be would have been to have indulged in a ten minutes' tussle with this young sprig of fashion. Mr. Warren, however, noticing the"], [111, "103 ANNIE AT HOME. boldness of the baronet and his friend, was delighted. He joined in chorus to the ballads Annie sang, and shouted bravo to her piano pieces. Annie herself, amused for the moment Avith their visitors, and perhaps, not displeased Avith the compliments her performance elicited, Avas concerned to see Gilbert so grave. She imagined it was due entirely to her father's rudeness, and determined upon some other occasion to enter into an explana tion Avith him. Sir Charles, however, remembering an engagement, noAv rose to take leave. \" We have been most agreeably entertained, Miss Warren, said he, and I trust our visit has not been incon venient.\" \" Bless you no, Sir Charles, said Michael Warren, glad to see you ahvays.\""], [112, "104 MARTYRS TO FASHION. \" In that case,\" said the baronet \" I trust to have the pleasure of hearing Miss Warren's delightful voice again, and if you would condescend to honour an unfortunate bachelor with your company at the Manor some day, it Avould give me the greatest pleasure I assure you.\" \" Most happy.

Cruppy, hearing a stir, roused himself from the kitchen settle and came to watch them off. He stood there shaking his head vigorously, considering his in dolent disposition, and glancing towards the parlour, chuckled, as he remembered that Mr. Warren in his enthusiasm had forgotten he was leaving Annie and Gilbert together. \" When the cat's away the mice will play,\" thought Cruppy, and in order to apply the proverb personally, Avent and dreAv himself another mug of ale, which he calculated upon finishing off before Mr. Warren came into supper \u2014 Mrs. Higgins having left Cruppy the key of the cellar Avhile absent for a gossip with Mr. Compton's cook."], [114, "CHAPTER V.

He kept, generally, aloof from the feasts, club processions, and merry-makings of Merton, believing as he did, that they led to dissolute and idle habits. \"You must judge for yourself, Annie,\" he said. \" If such manners as you have seen to-night please you, I can have nothing to say, but I would beg"], [139, "131 A LITTLE FEMININE SOPHISTRY. you for your oavu sake not to value them at more than they are worth.\" \" But supposing father invites them here, what can I do ?\" \" Forget what I have said, Annie.

It was the mere hard calcu lating in figures, the value of so much thought, anxiety, originality, or what ever the gift might be. So that first greeting of \" stand aside,\" though merely the exclamation of a railway porter, echoed in George's mind long after. He had been in the way for the moment, and was made of no more account than a heap of stones, or a wheelbarrow. The Londoner has certainly some excuse for his selfishness.

It is all very well to say, that in this stern city battle field, where the fight is so fierce \u2014 where, instead of life passing omvard like an inland stream, it foams and bubbles like a mountain torrent \u2014 where men are Avorn out, and grow grey and prematurely old from sheer weariness of the inces-"], [182, "174 MARTYRS TO FASHION. sant strife \u2014 it is all very well to say that in such scenes our best energies are aroused \u2014 that genius makes it mark that noble work is done, and great ends gained.

Upon the death of his father Mrs. Harland' s affairs were not very prosperous, and she had applied to her brother for assistance. Mr. Shirley, however, received her coldly, and without distinctly refusing to help his sister, shoAved his disclination so plainly in his manner, that the sensitive woman never asked him again.

However, as they were unacquainted with anyone else having equal influence in the commercial world, George decided, at least, to call upon his uncle and state his vieAvs. Messrs. Shirley and Son were Colonial merchants on an extensive scale, and when George Harland reached his uncle's door in St. Mary Axe, he felt somewhat abashed by the magnificent appearance of the premises. A long range of offices extended in front, fitted up with hand some mahogany desks so brilliantly polished, that the clerks could see their own faces on the shining wood. Thick plate glass windows, that would have"], [187, "179 SHIRLEY AND SON. graced a ducal mansion, admitted the light, and lofty doors of solid oak admitted the customers to Shirley and Son. There was a huge gateAvay shut from the outer world by heavy folding gates, through which lumbering vans full of heavy goods thundered all day long, to unload in the spacious yard at the back of the premises, while the private count ing house was more like the reception room of a prince than the sanctum of a man of business. Yet, notwithstanding these external evidences of prosperity, whispers passed from desk to desk that something was Avrong. There had been a severe money panic in the city, and the rate of discount was rising like an overwhelming tide. Prices fluctuated alarmingly, and bad debts occurred almost daily. In fact, the affairs of Shirley and Son were n 2"], [188, "180 MARTYRS TO FASHION. in a most complicated, not to say dubious, state.

After several minutes of utter silence, the accountant said \u2014 \" If you could get the bills you have in hand discounted at a moderate rate, and obtain some indulgence from the heaviest creditors, there is just a little possibility of tiding over the worst,"], [189, "181 SHIRLEY AND SON. for the present. Then, with reviving business in the spring, and greater ease in the money market, all might yet be well.\" \" Discount !\" said the merchant, Avith a sigh. \" I paid tAvelve per cent, for the last bills, and even then, they were done as a favor. Besides, upon the five thousand taken by the London and Universal, scarcely any have yet run off.\" He opened his desk as he spoke, and referred to the diary, muttering to himself, \" Jones, seventy-tAvo. Hankey and Smith, sixty-eight pounds four and two. Wilson and Son, thirty-nine ten six.

The fact was, Cruppy, in the midst of his folly and selfishness, had an almost reverential affection for Annie. He believed that if left to her own feelings she would become a happy wife, and that the taste and talent she possessed would serve to brighten her home, and be a source of gratifi cation to her husband. He was quick enough to perceive . Michael Warren's ambition, and knew that the longer it was persisted in, the more likely it Avas to result in humiliation to himself, and sorroAV to his daughter. There fore, everything Cruppy did and said was done and said under protest. \"I tell you what, Cruppy,\" said the farmer, \" I must look out for"], [222, "214 MARTYRS TO FASHION. another odd man about the place, you are getting fat and saucy.\" Cruppy muttered something to the effect that he supposed his internal arrangements Avere affected by the pie he had eaten for supper the night before. \" There's a glass of wine in that decanter, if you like to drink it,\" said the farmer, and Cruppy lost no time in adopting his master's suggestion. \" Now run and fetch my patent leather boots, Cruppy, and I shall be ready. Come, I think it would puzzle any of our Merton folks to turn out in better style than this.\" He now called lustily upstairs for Annie and his wife.

She consoled"], [223, "DINING AT THE MANOR. 215 herself Avith the idea that it was only a temporary indulgence, and that mat ters would come some day to a favorable issue between herself and Gilbert. The handsome dress she was putting on, and the prospect of a glimpse into an ideal world, which had hitherto been but a dreamland to her, helped con siderably to restore her equanimity. The elegance of her appearance when she came down and they were ready to start, quite delighted her father. \" Capital, capital,\" said he, \" fit to enter the drawing room of a duke, by all that's gracious.\" He was not quite so well satisfied with the get-up of his wife.

She was fond of drawing, and when Sir Charles showed her a gallery full of fine works by the greatest of our modern painters her delight knew no bounds. The young baronet had little sympathy with the old masters, \" Let their monks and martyrs stay in the musty old cathedrals for Avhich they were painted,\" said he, \" and as for Dutch painting with all its fidelity it is far behind photo graphy.\" The appointments of the dinner table Avere rich and splendid.

As for Michael Warren he made himself ridiculous every five minutes, in conse quence of his labored efforts to shoAV that he Avas perfectly at his ease and accustomed to the usages of good society. There was a footpath leading from Merton to Oxford, which passed through the grounds and very near to the house. In order to secure seclusion for the baronet's favorite dining room a group of thick evergreens had been planted upon that side of the laAvn. It was easy to approach unperceived near enough to hear much that was said in the room when the French windows were open ; and here, after wandering listlessly all the afternoon, Gilbert found himself as dusk came on.

But he Avaited there hour after hour, and if at times some person he kneAv from Merton or any of the neighbouring villages passed that Avay, he would ramble aAvay amongst the trees of the park, so as not to be seen, and then come back again to the same spot.

A Ioav hedge separated the shrubbery from the park itself, and Gilbert, unable to control himself any longer, leaped it, and remained concealed amongst the dense foliage able to see the whole party and to hear much that was said. Sir Charles was leading Annie to the piano, most unwillingly as Gilbert fancied, while her father was laughing and ridiculing her folly as he termed it. Annie, to please him, sang several times, and Michael Warren praised her and stamped upon the floor, beating time in the wrong place. Gilbert saw plainly, what he had suspected all along, that the baronet and his companions were indulging in incessant ridicule at the farmer's expense. Warren, however, was too much bent"], [229, "DINING AT THE MANOR. 221 upon his own ambitious views to be aAvare of this, and Avhen Captain Mellor slapped him on the back with such force as to spill a glass of wine that had just reached the farmer's lips, he appeared quite delighted with what he conceived an evidence of good-fellowship. The baronet had been singing a new song, with a lively waltzing movement, and Michael Warren, flushed with wine, began to caper nimbly about the room, greatly to the discomposure of his wife and daughter. \"Play us a polka, Mellor,\" said Sir Charles, \"and if Miss Warren will be my partner I shall be delighted.\" The Captain sat down to the piano and strummed the graceful Annen Polka, very much out of time and Avith many false notes.

Annie had time to decline the baronet's proposal, his hand was round her waist, and she was whirled along the floor. \"On to the laAvn, Sir Charles,\" cried Captain Mellor, \" a dance out of doors will be glorious after this hot room.\" \"A capital suggestion, Mellor,\" said the baronet, and the whole party streamed out upon the lawn immediately. Annie, little dreaming who was watch ing them, and over-ruled by her father, made no further objection, and became Sir Charles's partner in a quadrille. When it was finished, the baronet said, \" you are too Avarm, Miss Warren, to sit doAvn in yonder close room, let us take a turn down the avrenue.\" Annie looked, expecting others of the party to folloAv, and then timidly took Sir Charles's proffered arm."], [231, "DINING AT THE MANOR. 223 \"Oh, never mind them,\" said he, with an impassioned glance. \" It will be much more agreeable alone, I assure you.\" \" I would rather go back, indeed, Sir Charles.\" \" Nonsense ! said he, laughing, I could not afford to lose such an agreeable opportunity for a tete-a-tete.\" He grasped her arm a little more firmly as .he spoke, and half pulled the reluctant girl toward the avenue. She was considerably alarmed by these bold manners, but concluded that the baronet had perhaps been drinking rather freely after dinner. They passed into the avenue, as Annie looking back, saw her father, the Captain, and one or two others standing on the opposite side of the laAvn. \" What a trembling sensitive darling it is,\" said Sir Charles, throwing his"], [232, "224 MARTYRS TO FASHION. arms around her as soon as they were out of sight. \" What does this mean ? Let me go Sir Charles. How can you treat me in this way. Let me go to my father, instantly.\" \" Not till I've had a kiss, my beauty \u2014 Come don't be so hard-hearted.\" An instant \u2014 and Gilbert rushed from his hiding-place, blind with fury, and struck Sir Charles violently. The baronet Avas not a novice at such work, having had many a tussle in town and goAvn squabbles when at the University. He returned the blow instantly, but Gilbert's superior strength added to intense passion, was too much for the baronet, and he fell almost senseless to the ground beneath a second poAverful bloAv. Paralyzed with terror, Annie stood for a time, utterly unable to speak or move. As soon as her self-possession"], [233, "DINING AT THE MANOR. 225 returned she ran breathless out of the avenue to seek for assistance. Captain Mellor and her father came up at this moment, and lifted Sir Charles from the ground. Sir Charles, as soon as he recovered breath, said passionately \u2014 \" Lock that fellow up, somebody, and send for the police. It is not the first time I have endured his insolence. We will see what a term of imprisonment will do for him.\" However, when one of the servants stepped forward to lay hold of him, Gilbert sent him reeling back with a rapid blow, and leaping the low hedge, over which he had gained access to the laAvn, disappeared.

Cruppy was so mystified, that contrary to his usual custom, \u25a0 he took counsel with Mrs. Higgins respecting it. But that lady, although she assumed a mysterious aspect, intending to impress Cruppy that she knew a great deal more than she chose to tell, Avas fain to confess, at length, that she really kneAv nothing of the matter, save and except that if anything unpleasant had taken place, \"it was for a wise purpose.\""], [235, "CHAPTER XII. THE NEXT MORNING. As the light of dawn streamed into Annie's pretty bedchamber, the next morning, she awoke from a feverish and unrefreshing sleep, very excited and unhappy. She lingered in her room after dressing herself, as though unwilling to face that common-place every-day world which she had put aside for a few hours on the previous evening.

There was everything to minister to a cultivated fancy, with society capable of appre ciating cultivated tastes. Annie pitied Gilbert, certainly, and she could not help sighing a little on her own account, though she blamed herself at the same time for craving so much that seemed beyond her reach. Time Avas when her ovvn thoughts and tastes were sufficient for her. When the glorious aspects of nature were a never-ending source of delight.

Clearly enough she saw that the scandal put in circulation by this event, Avould serve the Merton gossips for a long time to come, even if it should ever die out. Country folks are readier than those of the town to whisper away a reputation, and would not this make Gilbert shun her for the future? The smoke of a pij>e was wafted to her window as she opened it.

This then was upon her account. Even the poor, lazy, cadging Cruppy's thoughts were occupied with her pros pects and feelings.

The messenger, while Avaiting in the surgery, unburdened himself of all he kneAV about the fray at the manor, embellishing the narrative with a few touches from his OAvn imagina tion.

There was such an earnestness in Cruppy's tone, that Mr. Warren listened to him, even from curiosity, but with haughty toleration also, as to an imbecile who scarcely knew what he was saying. \" Lord, what do you know about good society,\" he said presently. \" Enough to rockon up a man's inten tions, I can tell you, master, and the smartest coat that ever was made wouldn't hide a black heart from me.\" Mr. Warren fancied that Cruppy must have some special revelation to make respecting the baronet, but it was not so. \" It matters little to me, uoav,\" Cruppy continued, \" whether you like what I say or not, seeing this is the last time I shall have anything to say at the Mount Farm.\" \" Quite right too, if you will persist in poking your nose -into affairs that"], [246, "238 MARTYRS TO FASHION. don't concern you,\" the farmer retorted, but there Avas such an evident tone of regret at the idea of parting Avith the fat lazy bird-keeper, that instead of say ing more, he listened to give Cruppy the opportunity of making an apology.

The Captain indeed Avas bent upon playing a double game, but the chances went perversely against him. One thing is certain.

Uncertain hoAV far the Captain's influence extended, the man hesitated to press him for the amount, but eventually adopted the plan of \"being just out\" of the article Mellor wanted. This happened frequently, and no matter if the Captain, with a scoavI, remarked that he had seen the identical thing in the Avindow the same morning, the \"just sold out\" plan was persevered in, until the Cap tain, sIoav as he was to take a hint, hoAvever broad, felt himself compelled to furnish cash doAvn for gloves, hats, hosiery, and other light articles.

The Captain managed to make a tolerable harvest out of his widowed mother, who lived upon a little estate near Guilford, but there are times when even mothers cease to accept for gospel what their handsome sons please to tell them, and it sometimes happened that the Captain, after the trouble of a journey to Guilford, and a little present to pave the way, was compelled to come \" bootless home, and weather beaten back \" to Jenny n Street.

He was capricious in his choice. Per haps, after being served with a Avrit in the morning he would meet Laura in the evening with the conviction that the next hour would settle the matter.

A very few minutes sufficed to restore Caroline's confidence, and soon, in answer to the Captain, she chatted quite gaily.

Yet it was solely on her account that poor Sandall became involved.

But circumstances had prevented him completing the landscape. He had"], [286, "278 MARTYRS TO FASHION. been ill. Then the Aveather had been showery, and he Avished to paint in the open air.

The bill was paid, and the man of laAV departed. A wonderful change came over the artist in five minutes.
