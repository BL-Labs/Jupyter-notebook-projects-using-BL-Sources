It is familiar knowledge that the earth which we inhabit is a globe of somewhat less than 8000 miles in diameter, being one of a series of eleven which revolve at different distances around the sun, and some of which have satellites in like manner revolving around them. The sun, planets, and satellites, with the less intelligible orbs termed comets, are comprehensively called the solar sys- tem ; and if we take as the .uttermost bounds of this system the orbit of Uranus (though the comets actually have a wider range) , we shall find that it occupies a portion of space not less than three thousand six hundred millions of miles in diameter. The mind fails to form an exact notion of a por- B"], [16, "2 THE BODIES OF SPACE, tion of space so immense ; but some faint idea of it may be obtained from the fact, that, if the swiftest race-horse ever known had begun to traverse it, at full speed, at the time of the birth of Moses, he would as yet have accomplished only half his journey. It has long been concluded amongst astrono mers, that the stars, though they appear to our eyes only as brilliant points, are all to be con sidered as suns, representing so many solar sys tems, each bearing a general resemblance to our own. The stars have a brilliancy and apparent magnitude which we may safely presume to be in proportion to their actual size and the distance at which they are placed from us. Attempts have been made to ascertain the distance in some in stances by calculations founded on parallax ; that is, the change of relative situation produced on a heavenly object by our planet passing from one part of its orbit to another exactly opposite ; it being previously understood that if, upon this base of nearly two hundred millions of miles, an angle of so much as one second, or the 3600th part of a degree, could be raised, the distance might be assumed in that instance as not less than 19,200,000 millions of miles! In the case"], [17, "THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. 3 of the most brilliant star, Sirius, even this minute parallax could not be found; from which, of course, it was to be inferred that that star is farther removed than even this vast distance. In some others, on which the experiment has been tried, it was equally impossible to detect a parallax. We seemed thus to be left in a hopeless state of igno rance regarding the measurements of the sidereal universe, as if it were such a question as man was not destined ever to answer ; but at length, in our own time, responses came from several points almost at once. By Professor Henderson, it was ascertained that the star a of the constellation of the Centaur, the third in brightness in our heavens, but in reality a double star, and believed for various reasons to be among those nearest to us, had a parallax of a full second, establishing its distance in miles at about nineteen millions of millions. Afterwards, Bessel assigned a parallax of thirty one hundredths of a second to the double star 61 Cygni, placing it at a distance nearly 670,000 times that of the earth from the sun.(') Such are but the first steps we take in imagination amongst the hosts of orbs by which we are surrounded. If we suppose that similar intervals exist between all the stars, we shall readily see that the space b 2"], [18, "4 THE BODIES OF SPACE, occupied by even the comparatively small number visible to the naked eye must be vast beyond all powers of human conception. The number visible to the eye is about three thousand ; but when a telescope of small power is directed to the heavens, a great number more come into view, and the number is ever increased in proportion to the increased power of the in strument. In one place, where they are more thickly sown than elsewhere, Sir William Herschel reckoned that fifty thousand passed over a field of view two degrees in breadth in a single hour. It was first surmised by the ancient philosopher, Democritus, that the faintly white zone which spans the sky under the name of the Milky Way, might be only a dense collection of stars too remote to be distinguished. This conjecture has been verified by the instruments of modern astro nomers, and some speculations of a most remark able kind have been formed in connexion with it. By the joint labours of the two Herschels, the sky has been \"gauged\" in all directions by the telescope, so as to ascertain the conditions of dif ferent parts with respect to the frequency of stars. The result has been a conviction that, as the planets are parts of solar systems, so are solar"], [19, "THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. 5 systems parts of what may be called Astral Sys tems \u2014 that is, systems composed of a multitude of stars, bearing a certain relation to each other. The astral system to whicii we belong, is conceived to be of an oblong, fiattish form, with a space wholly or comparatively vacant in the centre, while the extremity in one direction parts into two. The stars are most thickly sown in the outer parts of this vast ring, and these constitute the Milky Way. Our sun is believed to be placed in the southern portion of the ring, near its inner edge, so that we are presented with many more stars, and see the Milky Way much more clearly, in that direction, than towards the north, in which line our eye has to traverse the vacant central space. Nor is this all. A motion of our solar system with respect to the stars, first suggested by Sir William Herschel, in 1783, has since been verified by the exact calculations of M. Argelander, late director of the Observatory at Abo. The sun is proceeding towards a point in the constellation Hercules. It is, therefore, receding from the inner edge of the ring. Motions of this kind, through such vast regions of space, must be long in producing any change sensible to the inha bitants of our planet, and it is not easy to grasp"], [20, "THE BODIES OF SPACE, their general character ; but grounds have never theless been found for supposing that not only our sun, but the other suns of the system, pursue a wavy course round the ring, from west to east, crossing and recrossing the middle of the annular circle. \" Some stars will depart more, others less, from either side ofthe circumference of equilibrium, according to the places in which they are situated, and according to the direction and the velocity with which they are put in motion. Our sun is probably one of those which depart furthest from it, and descend furthest into the empty space within the ring.\"(2) According to this view, a time may come when we shall be much more in the thick of the stars of our astral system than we are now, and have of course much more brilliant nocturnal skies ; but it may be countless ages before the eyes which are to see this added re splendence shall exist. The evidence of the existence of other astral systems is much more decided than might be expected, when we consider that the nearest of them must needs be placed at a mighty interval beyond our own. The elder Herschel, directing his wonderful tube towards the sides of our sys tem, where stars are planted most rarely, and"], [21, "THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. 7 raising the powers of the instrument to the re quired pitch, was enabled with awe-struck mind to see suspended in the vast empyrean astral systems, or, as he called them, firmaments, re sembling our own. Like light cloudlets to a certain power of the telescope, they resolved themselves, under a greater power, into stars, though these generally seemed no larger than the finest particles of diamond dust. The general forms of these systems (nebul\u00e6) are various. So also are the distances, as proved by the different degrees of telescopic power necessary to bring them into view. The furthest observed by the astronomer were estimated by him as thirty-five thousand times more remote than Sirius, sup posing its distance to be about twenty millions of millions of miles. More recently, the Earl of Rosse has brought his superb instruments to bear upon these distant objects, and thus revealed them in more wondrous forms than before. Many which Herschel saw only as filmy matter, spread in patches over the sky, are now found to be vast aggregations of stars. Many which to the elder philosopher seemed round and well defined, are seen by his successor to have branches starting out in dif-"], [22, "8 THE BODIES OF SPACE, ferent directions \u2014 filaments, as he calls them \u2014 the language applicable to the smallest of objects examined in our hands, being thus found appli cable to the promontories of those great continents, each atom of which may be said to be millions of miles removed from another. Such is the universe, as developed to the per ceptions of the modern philosopher \u2014 different indeed from that of our forefathers, who did not know the bounds even of this little world, and beheld in the sun, moon, and stars only a set of menial lights ordained, usefully or not, to attend it. And to such contemplations are we raised by modern science, if we choose to leave for them the strifes and self-seekings of our social scene. Thinking of such acquisitions of knowledge, one cannot but go warmly along with the living Herschel when he speaks of the discoveries of Struve, Bessel, and Henderson, as among the fairest flowers of civilization. They surely jus tify, as he says, \" the vast expenditure of time and talent which have led up to them,\" and show that \" there are yet behind not only secrets of nature which shall increase the wealth and power of man, but truths which shall ennoble the age and the country in which they are divulged, and"], [23, "THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION 9 by dilating the intellect, re-act on the moral cha racter of mankind.\" (3) Where our perceptive faculties are baffled, we dream; where they compass their object, we in quire after cause. Such is a law of our minds, which cannot have been bestowed upon us without being designedfor a good end. And, indeed, it is by experience placed beyond all doubt, that to yield to this impulse is to use a direct means of improv ing our condition on earth, and to advance in the scale of moral as well as intellectual being. Nor are we left to doubt that extensions of knowledge, either in simple fact or in cause and relation, are not to be estimated by their immediate and appa rent effects ; for both are there often good results of the most tangible kind where no such thing was expected \u2014 \u25a0 as from Napier's discovery of the logarithms, or, to take an opposite instance, from Smith's ascertainment of the order of rocks \u2014 and it is utterly impossible in any way to reckon the benefits which light confers upon mind wherever it is allowed to enter. Assuming, then, the legitimacy of such inquiries, and yet holding by the reverence which Created owes to Creating, we may without fear yield to the instinct which sends us to ask after cause with regard to B 3"], [24, "10 THE BODIES OF SPACE, this vast and beauteous scene. How has it been that these orby myriads have taken the places in which we find them ? To what authorship are we to ascribe the whole ? In philosophizing, the prime difficulty is to bring down the mind to sufficiently simple con ceptions. The many soar and mystify, and come to nothing ; to few is it given to find truth where it usually lies, amongst the things most familiar. The ideas which the ancients formed of the move ments of the heavenly bodies were lofty, but utterly false. It was reserved for the geometers of the last two centuries, by pursuing truth on more solid grounds, to establish the simplicity which is now known to extend through the phy sical constitution of the universe. It has been fully ascertained that the planets have obtained their forms, keep their places with regard to the sun and to each other, and pursue all their various motions, in obedience to certain laws which are to be every day seen acting on the humblest scale in our very presence. Thus, the earth is a globe for the same reason that a dew-drop is so. It is slightly flattened at the poles, as a consequence of rotation on an axis when in a soft state, for the same reason that a mass of clay whirled rapidly"], [25, "THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. 11 round will become of a similar shape. The sun and earth are mutually attracted in proportion to their respective masses, and inversely as the square of the distance, which is a law prevailing with not less certainty upon two rose leaves float ing on the summer lake into which they have fallen. The revolution of the planet or satellite in an orbit round a central mass is, again, the result of a composition of two opposite forces \u2014 one of them this attraction of gravity in its proper proportions, the other a primitive motion of the one mass away from the other in a straight line ; and this phenomenon is exemplified when we see a stone which has been thrown from a boy's hand, brought in a curve to the ground. All these marvels rest on mathematical calculations of the nicest exactness, insomuch that, taking one as an example, astronomers have computed ten years beforehand, the time at which the planet Jupiter would pass our meridian, and the predicted time was correct within half a second. Since Newton stated the laws of gravity and of the planetary motions, there have been some im portant additions to his philosophy. It has been shown, that certain perturbations in the planetary movements, which appeared to him as denoting a"], [26, "12 THE BODIES OF SPACE, necessary end to the system, observe periods, and are only further proofs of the stability of the whole arrangement. It has also been discovered that the laws of motion extend beyond the solar system. Amongst the serene orbs, which seem so still to our ordinary perceptions, we now know that there is no such thing as rest. Stars are ascertained to have proper motions, of the same nature with that found in our own sun. Many are seen to be, in reality, double or triple\u2014 that is, composed of a plurality of suns, which perform regular revolu tionary motions round each other in ellipses. The periods of some of these movements and revolu tions are of such brevity, that their elements are already in the book of the astronomer ; others are seen to be of such vastness, that the times which have determinated the youth and death of our oldest empires, would be, in comparison, but as a little spoke in some enormous wheel. Yet of all of them no doubt can be entertained that they depend upon those simple physical laws which preside over every particle of tangible matter in our own sphere. Here it is right to advert to some general fea tures of the solar system, most of which have also been discovered since the days of Newton. It is"], [27, "13 THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. in the first place, remarkable, that the planets all move nearly in one plane, corresponding with the centre of the sun's body. Next, it is not less worthy of attention, that the motion of the sun on its axis, those of the planets around the sun, and the satellites around their primaries, (*) and the motions of all on their axes, are in one direction \u2014 namely, from west to east. Had all these mat ters been left to accident, the chances against the uniformity would have been, though calculable, inconceivably great. Of the forty-three motions ascertained in the early part of this century, it was found by Laplace, that the adverse chances were as upwards of four millions of millions to one. It is thus powerfully impressed on us that the uni formity of the motions, as well as their general adjustment to one plane, must have been a conse quence of a single cause acting throughout the whole system. Some of the other relations of the bodies are not less remarkable. It is, perhaps, of little con sequence that the larger planets are towards the outside of the system, since there is an absence of regularity in the gradation in this respect. In the series of comparative densities we find an approach to a regular gradation : they stand thus in decimals,"], [28, "14 THE BODIES OF SPACE, the Earth being considered as 1 \u2014 Mercury, 2*95 ; Venus, *99 ; Earth, 1 ; Mars, *79 ; Jupiter, *23 ; Saturn, 11 ; Uranus, *26; the last being the only very decided violation of the rule. Then the dis tances are curiously relative. It has been found that, if we place the following line of numbers, \u2014 0 3 6 12 24 48 96 192, ancl add 4 to each, we shall have a series denoting the respective distances of the planets from the sun. It will stand thus \u2014 4 7 10 16 28 52 100 196 Merc. Venus. Earth. Mars. Jupiter. Saturn. Uranus. It will be observed that the first row of figures goes on from the second on the left hand in a succes sion of duplications, or multiplications by 2. Surely there is here a most surprising proof of unity in the solar system. It was remarked, when this relation was first detected, that there was wanting a planet corresponding to 28 ; the difficulty was afterwards considered as overcome, by the discovery of four small planets revolving at nearly one mean distance from the sun, between Mars and Jupiter.(5) The distances bear an equally interesting mathematical relation to the times of the revolutions round the sun. With respect to any two planets, the squares of the times of revolu-"], [29, "15 THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. tions are to each other in the same proportion as the cubes of their mean distances, \u2014 a most surprising result, for the discovery of which the world was indebted to the illustrious Kepler. Sir John Herschel truly observes \u2014 \" When we contemplate the constituents of the planetary system from the point of view which this relation affords us, it is no longer mere analogy which strikes us, no longer a general resemblance among them, as individuals independent of each other, and circulating about the sun, each according to its own peculiar nature, and connected with it by its own peculiar tie. The resemblance is now perceived to be a true family likeness; they are bound up in one chain \u2014 interwoven in one web of mutual relation and har monious agreement, subjected to one pervading influence, which extends from the centre to the furthest limits of that great system, of which all of them, the Earth included, must henceforth be re garded as members.\" (6) The tendency of all the later discoveries has been to deepen the conviction arising from the first, that the physical affairs of the universe are all under the regulation of laws ; the forms, the dis tances, the movements, the inter-dependencies, are determined in this, as distinguished from any arbi-"], [30, "16 THE BODIES OF SPACE, trary manner. What, in the science of nature, is a law ? It is merely the term applicable where any series of phenomena is seen invariably to occur in certain given circumstances, or in cer tain given conditions. Such phenomena are said to obey a law, because they appear to be under a rule or ordinance of constant opera tion. In the case of these physical laws, we can bring the idea to mathematical elements, and see that numbers, in the expression of space or of time, form, as it were, its basis. We thus trace in law, Intelligence \u2014 often we can see that it has a bene ficial object, still more strongly speaking of mind as concerned in it. There cannot, however, be an inherent intelligence in these laws ; we cannot con ceive of mind actually working in the agglomera tion of a dew-drop or the orbitual revolution of the moon. The intelligence appears external to the laws; something of which the laws are but as the expressions of the Will and Power. If this be admitted, the laws cannot be regarded as primary or independent causes of the phenomena of the physical world. We come, in short, to a Being beyond nature \u2014 its author, its God ;\u2014in finite, \u2014 inconceivable, it may be, and yet one whom these very laws present to us with attributes show-"], [31, "17 THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. ing that our nature is in some way a faint and far cast shadow7 of His, while all the gentlest and beautifullest of our emotions lead us to believe that we are as children in his care, and as vessels in his hand. We must consequently understand \u2014 and this is for the reader's special attention \u2014 that when we speak of natural law, we only speak of the mode in which the Divine Power is exer cised. It is but another phrase for the action of the ever-present and sustaining God. Viewing Nature in this light, the pursuit of science is but the seeking of a deeper acquaintance with the Infinite. The endeavour to explain any events in her history, however grand or mysterious these may be, is only to sit like a child at a mother's knee, and fondly ask of the things which passed before we were born. In modesty and reverence, in the spirit of the love of truth, and of that crav ing of an innate helplessness, which seems as if it could never be satisfied till it knew all, we may even inquire if there be any trace of the origin of that arrangement ofthe universe which is presented to our notice. In this inquiry, we start with the clear fact of the orbs being determined in their forms by law. The fact here pointed to necessarily infers a previous"], [32, "18 THE BODIES OF SPACE, form of matter, one in which the molecules were separately moveable \u2014 fluid or gasiform \u2014 just as the law by which the dew-drop is spherified, im plies that the constituent particles were in such a condition before it took effect. We thus sec the Will which constitutes law acting in a non-material manner in that portion of what we are accustomed to call Creation. In the places and relations of the orbs, there is equal proof, though of a less popularly tangible kind, that law was concerned. The work was done by the will of God, expressed in the form of the law of gravitation. When we come to consider the motions, and regard them as necessarily containing results of an impulse, we are apt to suppose some immediate and more direct or arbitrary application of Divine Power necessary ; but this cannot stand a second consideration. The motions, as well as the arrangements, are in extricably wrought up in relation with the magni tudes ; a totally different mode of their origin is therefore inconceivable. Having, moreover, in gravitation, a general source of motion, and know ing in what various ways a motive power may be applied, \u2014 see, for a familiar example, the wheels of a clock revolving under the influence ofa weight, all difficulty in supposing an actual origin of a"], [33, "19 THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. natural kind for the motions of the heavenly bodies vanishes, however obscure our notions may remain as to the process concerned in the case. Thus, everything leads us to the belief that there was a previous form of matter, the alteration of which into the present was brought about in the manner of, though certainly not by any self-dependent efficacy in, Natural Law. At this point we might rest, for in the general conclusion that the orbs were formed and arranged in such a manner, enough has been gained for the present object. It is worth while, however, to touch slightly on the ideas which have passed through certain eminent minds with respect to the births of these bodies. The first idea of what has been called the nebu lar cosmogony arose with Sir William Herschel, in consequence of the observations which he made regarding a class of heavenly bodies, to which the appellation of nebul\u00e6 had been applied, in reference to their cloud-like appearance. Some of these bodies were ascertained, by a high telescopic power, to be only astral systems, like our own, placed at such avast distance, that the individuality of the stars composing them was lost, to ordi nary perception. Others resisted the highest"], [34, "20 THE BODIES OF SPACE, telescopic pow\u00e6r which the astronomer applied, and, from various considerations, he came to re gard them as masses of diffused luminous matter. In these he further discovered a variety of appear ances, marking what seemed a gradation of cha racters, as if they had been in various degrees of condensation ; and hence he was led to surmise that they were solar systems in the process of be ing formed out of a previous condition of matter. Laplace now stepped forward to show that, if such a luminous matter existed, and if nuclei were es tablished in it, these might become centres of ag gregation for the neighbouring diffused matter; on such centres a rotatory motion would be es tablished, wherever, as was the most likely case, there was any obliquity in the lines of direction in which the opposing currents met each other : this motion would increase as the agglomeration pro ceeded: at certain intervals, the centrifugal force acting in the exterior of the rotating mass would overcome the agglomerating force, and a series of rings would thus be left apart, each possessing the motion proper to itself at the crisis of separation. These, again, could only continue in their annular form if uniform in constitution. There being many chances against this, they would probably break"], [35, "THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. 21 up, and be agglomerated into either one or several masses, which would then become representatives of the primary mass, and perhaps give rise to a simi lar progeny of inferior masses. The result would be \u2014 Planets and Satellites ; each having an orbitual speed corresponding with that of the zone consti tuting it ; each obtaining a rotatory motion from the excess of speed observed by the outer, over the inner portion ofthe zone. All this Laplace showed to be possible under the physical laws of the uni verse. In the case of our solar system, the results tally in the nicest way with the hypothesis : for example, the planets have rapid revolutionary motions in proportion to their nearness to the sun ; so also, do the primaries rotate more rapidly than the satellites revolve in their orbits. There are even singularities tending to support the hypo thesis ; the four small planets between Mars and Jupiter may be regarded as an example of a zone which agglomerated in distinct parts, while the rings of Saturn are instances of zones still in their original state. The Laplacian theory, it will be observed, only comes to the point at which we must needs arrive under a consideration of the \" web of relation\" traceable in the constituents of the solar system"], [36, "22 THE BODIES OF SPACE, \u2014 namely, that they have had a common origin in a soft and diffused form of matter. Such a form of matter may now, as is alleged, be no longer actually seen in the heavens ; and yet there may remain good reasons for believing that it once existed. One of these will afterwards be presented in the facts connected with the density of the planets and the internal heat of the earth. As another, I may point to the curious phenomenon called the Zodia cal Light, an oblate luminosity surrounding the sun, and very conspicuous in the twilights of tro pical climes ; a remnant, as has been supposed, of the diffused solar atmosphere of the nebular cos mogony. There is even a support to the hypo thesis in what would seem at first to be an anomaly and an objection \u2014 the existence ofthe many binary and ternary solar systems. It may be supposed that, at a certain point in thc confluence of the matter of these regions of space, the solar nuclei would become involved in a common revolutionary motion, linked inextricably with each other, though it might be at sufficient distances to allow of each body having afterwards its attendant planets. Such a phenomenon is occasionally realized to us on the surface of a river flowing between irregular banks. There we not only see single dimples ro-"], [37, "THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. 23 tating and passing onward, results of that obliquity in the meeting of currents which is thought to have set solar systems in motion, but often two or more of these dynamic microcosms will come within a range of mutual influence, and go on wheeling around each other. These fantastic eddies, which the musing poet will sometimes watch abstractedly for an hour, little thinking of the laws which produce and connect them, form an illustration of the mechanism of binary and ternary stars, and bring an unexpected aid to a hypothesis of the history of the heavenly spaces. A remarkable approximation has also been made to what may be called an experimental verification of this cosmogony, by a living pro fessor, M. Plateau, of Ghent. Divested of tech nical terms, the experiment was nearly as follows : \u2014 Placing a mixture of water and alcohol in a glass box, and therein a small quantity of olive oil of density precisely equal to the mixture, we have in the latter a liquid mass relieved from the operation of gravity, and free to take the exterior form given by the forces which may act upon it. In point of fact, the oil, by virtue of the law of molecular attraction, instantly takes a globular form. A vertical axis being introduced through"], [38, "24 THE BODIES OF SPACE, the box, with a small disc upon it, so arranged that its centre is coincident with the centre of the globe of oil, we turn the axis at a slow rate, and thus set the oil-sphere in rotation. \"We then presently see the sphere flatten at its poles and sioell out at its equator, and thus realize on a small scale an effect which is admitted to have taken place in the planets.\" The spherifying forces are of different natures, that of molecular attrac tion in the case of the oil, and of universal attrac tion in that of the planet ; but the results are analogous, if not identical. Quickening the rota tion makes the figure more oblately spheroidal. When it comes to be so quick as two or three turns in a second, \" the liquid sphere first takes rapidly its maximum of flattening, then becomes hollow above and below around the axis of rota tion, stretching out continually in a horizontal direction, and finally, abandoning the disc, is transformed into a perfectly regular ring.\" At first, this remains connected with the disc by a thin pellicle of oil ; which, however, on the disc being stopped, breaks and disappears, and the ring then becomes completely disengaged. The only ob servable difference between this ring and that of Saturn, is that it is rounded, instead of being"], [39, "THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. 25 flattened; but this is accounted for by the learned professor in a satisfactory way. A little after the stoppage of the rotatory motion of the disc, the ring of oil, losing its own motion, gathers once more into a sphere. If, however, a smaller disc be used, and its rotation continued after the separation of the ring, rotatory motion and centrifugal force will be generated in the al coholic fluid, and the oil-ring, thus prevented from returning into the globular form, divides itself into several isolated masses, each of which im mediately takes the globular form. These \" are almost always seen to assume, at the instant of their formation, a movement of rotation upon them selves, \u2014 a movement which constantly takes place in the same direction as that of the ring. Moreover, as the ring, at the instant of its rupture, had still a remainder of velocity, the spheres to which it has given birth tend to fly off at a tangent ; but, as on the other hand, the disc, turning in the alcoholic fluid, has impressed on this a movement of rotation, the spheres are especially carried along by this last movement, and revolve for some time round the disc. Those which revolve at the same time upon themselves, consequently then present the curious spectacle of planets revolving c"], [40, "26 THE BODIES OF SPACE, at the same time upon themselves and in their orbits. Finally \u2014 besides three or four large spheres into which the ring resolves itself, there are almost always produced one or two very small ones, which may thus be compared to satellites. The experiment presents, as we see, an image in miniature of the formation of the planets, accord- ing to the hypothesis of Laplace, by the rupture ofthe cosmical rings attributable to the condensa- tion of the solar atmosphere.\" (7) It must of course be admitted that the process of the experiment was of a reverse kind, and attended, as far as M. Plateau's description informs us, by slightly various effects ; but the general reflection which it gives of Laplace's cosmogony is certainly such as to confer upon that hypothesis a strong pro bability. To conclude this section of the history. What we see is \u2014 a boundless multitude of bodies with vast empty spaces between. We know of cer tain motions amongst these bodies ; of other and grander translations we are only beginning to get some knowledge. Beside this idea of locality and movement, we have the equally certain one of a former soft and more diffused state of the materials of these bodies ; also a tolerably clear one as to"], [41, "27 THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND FORMATION. gravitation having been the determining cause of both locality and movement. To no other con clusion, as it appears to me, can these various ideas lead, than to that of universal space being formerly occupied with gasiform matter; this, however, of irregular constitution, so that gravi tation caused it to break up and gather into patches, producing at once the relative localities of astral and solar systems, and the movements which they have since observed, in themselves and with regard to each other, from the daily spinning of single bodies on ideal axles, to the mazy dances of vast families of orbs, which come to periods only in millions of years. How grand, yet how simple the whole of this process \u2014 for a God only to conceive and do, and yet for man, after all, to trace out and ponder upon.

The orbs being all inextricably connected in the manner which has been described, are we also to presume that the constitution of the whole is uniform ? \u2014 that is to say, do the whole consist of the same chemical elements ? What are elements ? This is a term applied by the chemist to a limited number of substances (fifty-five are ascertained), which, in their com binations, form all the matters present in and about our globe. They are called elements, or simple substances, because it has hitherto been found impossible to reduce them into others, wherefore they are presumed to be the primary bases of all matters. It has, indeed, been sur mised that these so-called elements are only"], [43, "CONSTITUENT MATERIALS OF THE EARTH. 29 modifications of a primordial form of matter, brought about under certain conditions ; but if this should prove to be the case, it would little affect the present speculations. Analogy would lead us to conclude that the modifications of the pri mordial matter, forming our so-called elements, are as universal, or as liable to take place every where, as are the laws of gravitation and centri fugal force. It therefore appears likely that the gases, the metals, the earths, and other simple substances (besides whatever more of which we have no acquaintance), exist under proper con ditions, as well in the astral system which is thirty-five thousand times more distant than Sirius, as within the bounds of our own solar system or our own globe. Matter, whether it consists of about fifty-five ingredients, or only one, is liable to infinite varieties of conditions under different influences. As a familiar illustration, water, when subjected to a temperature under 32\u00b0 Fahrenheit, becomes ice; raise the temperature to 212\u00b0, and it becomes steam, occupying a vast deal more space than it formerly did. The gases, when subjected to pressure, become liquids; for example, carbonic acid gas, when subjected to weight equal to a"], [44, "30 CONSTITUENT MATERIALS OF THE EARTH column of water 1230 feet high, at a temperature of 32\u00b0, takes this form: the other gases require various amounts of pressure for this transforma tion, but all appear to be liable to it when the pressure proper in each case is administered. Heat is a power greatly concerned in regulating the volume and other conditions of matter. The chemist will probably yet tell us what additional amount of heat would be required to vaporize all the water of our globe ; how much more to disen gage the oxygen which is diffused in nearly a proportion of one-half throughout its solids ; and, finally, how much more would be required to cause the whole to become vaporiform, which we may consider as equivalent to its being restored to its supposed original nebulous state. He may calculate with equal certainty, what would be the effect of a considerable diminution of the earth's temperature \u2014 what changes would take place in each of its component substances, and how much the whole would shrink in bulk. The earth and all its various substances have at present a certain volume in consequence of the temperature which actually exists. If, then, we admit that its matter and that of the associate planets was at one time diffused throughout the"], [45, "AND OF THE OTHER BODIES OF SPACE. 31 whole space now circumscribed by the orbit of Uranus, it follows, after what we know of the power of heat, that the nebulous form of matter was attended by the condition of a very high temperature. The nebulous matter of space, pre viously to the formation of stellar and planetary bodies, must have been a universal Fire Mist, an idea which we can scarcely comprehend. The formation of systems out of this matter implies a change of some kind with regard to the con dition of the heat. Had this power continued to act with its full original repulsive energy, the process of agglomeration by attraction could not have gone on. We do not know enough of the laws of heat to enable us to surmise how the necessary change in this respect was brought about ; but we can trace some of the steps and consequences of the process. Uranus would be formed at the time when the heat of our system's matter was at the greatest, Saturn at the next, and so on. Now this tallies with the exceeding diffuseness of the matter of those elder planets, Saturn being not more dense or heavy than the substance cork. It may be that a sufficiency of heat still remains in those planets to make up for their distance from the sun, and the consequent"], [46, "32 CONSTITUENT MATERIALS OF THE EARTH smallness of the heat which they derive from his rays. And it may equally be, since Mercury is nearly thrice the density of the earth, that its matter exists under a degree of cold for which that planet's large enjoyment of the sun's rays is no more than a compensation. Thus there may be upon the whole a nearly equal experience of heat amongst all these children of the sun. Where, meanwhile, is the heat once diffused through the system, over and above what remains in the planets ? May we not rationally presume it to have gone to constitute that luminous en velope of the sun, in which his warmth-giving power is now held to reside ? It may have simply been reserved to constitute, at the last, a means of sustaining the many operations of which the planets were destined to be the theatre. The tendency of the preceding considerations is to impress the notion that our globe is a speci men of all the similarly-placed bodies of space, as respects its constituent matter and the physical and chemical laws governing it, with only this qualification, that there are possibly shades of variation with respect to the component mate rials, and undoubtedly with respect to the conditions under which the laws operate, and consequently"], [47, "33 AND OF THE OTHER BODIES OF SPACE. the effects which they produce. Thus, there may be substances here which are not in some of the other bodies, and substances here solid may be elsewhere liquid or vaporifornu We are the more entitled to draw such conclusions, seeing that there is nothing at all singular or special in the astronomical situation of the earth. It takes its place third in a series of planets, which series is only one of numberless other systems forming one group.

It therefore becomes a point of great interest \u2014 what are the materials of this specimen ? What is the constitutional character of this object, which may be said to be a sample, presented to our immediate observation, of those crowds of worlds which seem to us as the particles of the desert sand-cloud in number, and to whose diffusion there are no conceivable local limits ? The solids, liquids, and aeriform fluids of our globe are all, as has been stated, reducible into fifty-five substances hitherto called elementary. c 3"], [48, "34 CONSTITUENT MATERIALS OF THE EARTH Of these, forty are well-characterized metals, twelve non-metallic bodies, and the remaining three solid substances of intermediate character, which form a connecting link between the two great groups. Among the non-metallic elements, four \u2014 viz., oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and chlo rine, are permanently gaseous; bromine is fluid at common temperatures ; and the remainder (with the exception of fluorine, which has never been isolated, and whose physical characters are consequently unknown) are solid. The body oxygen is considered as by far the most abundant substance in our globe. It con stitutes a fifth part of our atmosphere, eight ninths of the weight of water, and a large pro portion of every kind of rock in the crust of the earth. Hydrogen, wdiich forms the remaining part of water, and enters into some mineral substance, is perhaps next. Nitrogen, of which the atmosphere is four-fifths composed, must be considered as an abundant substance. The metal silicium, which unites with oxygen in nearly equal parts to form silica, the basis of about a half of the rocks in the earth's crust, is, of course, an important ingredient. Aluminium, the metallic basis of alumina, a material which enters largely"], [49, "AND OF THE OTHER BODIES OF SPACE. 35 into many rocks, is another abundant elementary substance. So, also, is carbon, a small ingredient in the atmosphere, but the chief constituent of animal and vegetable substances, and of all fossils which ever were in the latter condition, amongst which coal takes a conspicuous place. The familiarly-known metals, as iron, tin, lead, silver, gold, are elements of comparatively small magnitude in that exterior part of the earth's body which we are able to investigate. It is remarkable of the elementary substances that they generally exist in combination. Thus, oxygen and nitrogen, though in mixture they form the aerial envelope of the globe, are never found separate in nature. Carbon is pure only in the diamond. And the metallic bases of the earths, though the chemist can disengage them, may well be supposed unlikely to remain long uncombined, seeing that contact with moisture makes them burn. Combination and re-com bination are principles largely pervading nature. There are few rocks, for example, that are not composed of at least two varieties of matter, each of which is again a compound of elementary substances. What is still more wonderful with respect to this principle of combination, all the"], [50, "36 CONSTITUENT MATERIALS OF THE EARTH elementary substances observe certain mathe matical proportions in their unions. When in the gaseous state, one volume of them unites with one, two, three, or more volumes of another, any extra quantity being sure to be left over, if such there should be. Combinations by weight are also governed by fixed and unchanging laws, of the greatest beauty and simplicity. It has hence been surmised that matter is composed of in finitely minute particles or atoms, each of which belonging to any one substance can only associate with a certain number of the atoms of any other. There are also strange predilections amongst substances for each other's company. One will remain combined in solution with another, till a third is added, when it will abandon the former and attach itself to the latter. A fourth being added, the third will perhaps leave the first, and join the new comer. Such is an outline of the information which chemistry gives us regarding the constituent ma terials of our globe, and their combinations. How infinitely is the knowledge increased in interest, when we consider the probability of such being the materials of the whole of the bodies of space, and the laws under which these everywhere"], [51, "AND OF THE OTHER BODIES OF SPACE. 37 combine, subject only to local and accidental variations ! In considering the cosmogenic arrangements of our globe, our attention is called in a special degree to the moon. In Laplace's hypothesis, satellites are con sidered as masses thrown off from their primaries, exactly as the primaries had previously been from the sun. The orbit of any satellite is also to be regarded as marking the bounds of the mass of the primary at the time when that satellite was thrown off; its speed likewise denotes the rapidity of the rotatory motion of the primary at that par ticular juncture. For example, the outermost of the four satellites of Jupiter revolves round his body at the distance of 1,180,582 miles; hence, according to the hypothesis, the planet was once about 3,675,501 miles in circumference, instead of being, as now, only 89,170 miles in diameter. This large mass would take rather more than sixteen days six hours and a half (the present revolutionary period of the outermost satellite) to rotate on its axis. The innermost satellite would be formed when the planet was reduced to a circumference of 309,075 miles, and rotated in about forty-two hours and a half."], [52, "38 CONSTITUENT MATERIALS OF THE EARTH From similar inferences, it would result that the mass of the earth, at a certain point of time after it was thrown off from the sun, was no less than 48*2,000 miles in diameter, being sixty times what it has since shrunk to. At that time, the mass must have taken rather more than twenty nine and a half days to rotate, (being the revolu tionary period of the moon,) instead of, as now, rather less than twenty-four hours. The time intervening between the formation of the moon, and the earth's diminution to its present size, was probably like one of those vast sums in which astronomy deals so largely, but which the mind altogether fails to grasp. The observation made upon the surface of the moon by telescopes tends strongly to support the hypothesis as to all the bodies of space being composed of similar matters subject to certain variations. It does not appear that our satellite is provided with an atmosphere of the kind found upon earth ; neither is there any appearance of water upon the surface. Yet that surface is, like the face of our globe, marked by inequalities and the appearance of volcanic operations. These inequalities and volcanic operations are upon a scale far greater than any which now exist upon"], [53, "AND OF THE OTHER BODIES OF SPACE. 39 the earth's surface. The mountains are, in many instances, equal in height to nearly the highest of our Andes. They are generally of extreme steep ness, and sharp of outline, peculiarities which might be looked for in a planet deficient in meteoric agencies such as those which operate so powerfully in wearing down ruggedness on the surface of our earth. The volcanic operations are on a stupendous scale. They are the cause of the bright spots of the moon, while the want of them is what distinguishes the duller portions, usually but erroneously called seas. In some parts, bright volcanic matter, besides covering one large patch, radiates out in long streams, whicii appear studded with subordinate foci of the same kind of energy. A large portion of the surface is covered with circular eminences, called Ring Mountains, of various diameters, from a quarter of a mile to several hundred miles, and in some places as close together as the circles on the surface of a boiling pot, which they in no small degree re semble. Some even intrude upon and obliterate portions of the neighbouring circles, thus leading to the idea of date, or a succession of events on the moon's surface. Generally, in the centre, there is a mount, which appears to be connected,"], [54, "40 CONSTITUENT MATERIALS OF THE EARTH in the way of cause, with the annular eminence, beyond which again vast boulder-like masses are in some instances seen scattered. What, how ever, most strikes the senses of an observer, is the vast profundity of some of the pits between the ring and the inner mount ; in one case, this is reckoned to be not less than 22,000 feet, or twice the height of \u00c6tna. These characteristics of the moon forbid the idea that it can be at present a theatre of life like the earth, and almost seem to declare that it never cau become so. But it is far from unlikely that the elements which seem wanting may be only in combinations different from those which exist here, and may yet be developed as we here find them. Seas may yet fill the profound hollows of the surface; an atmosrfliere may spread over the whole. Should these events take place, meteorological phenomena, and all the pheno mena of organic life, will commence, and the moon, like the earth, will become a green and inhabited world. (e) It is unavoidably held as a strong proof in favour of any hypothesis, when all the relative phenomena are in harmony with it. This is emi nently the case with the Laplacian cosmogony, for here the associated facts cannot be explained"], [55, "AND OF THE OTHER BODIES OF SPACE. 41 on any other supposition. We have seen reason to believe that the primary condition of matter was that of a diffused mass, in which the com ponent molecules were kept apart through the efficacy of heat ; that portions of this matter agglomerated into suns, which threw off planets ; that these planets were at first very much dif fused, but gradually contracted by cooling to their present dimensions. Now, as to our own globe, there is a remarkably distinct memorial of the supposed high temperature of the materials, in the store of heat which still exists in the interior. The immediate surface of the earth, be it ob served, exhibits only the temperature which might be expected to be imparted to such materials by the heat of the sun. There is a point a very short way down, but varying in different climes, where all effect from the sun's rays ceases. Then com mences a temperature from an entirely different cause, one which evidently has its source in the interior of the earth, and which regularly increases as we descend to greater and greater depths, the rate of increment being, in general, about one degree Fahrenheit for every fifty feet ; and of this high temperature there are other evidences, in the phenomena of volcanoes and thermal springs, as well as in what is ascertained with regard to the"], [56, "42 CONSTITUENT MATERIALS OF THE EARTH. density of the entire mass of the earth. This approximates five and a half times the weight of water ; but the actual weight of the principal solid substances composing the outer crust is as two and a half times the weight of water; and this, we know, if the globe were solid and cold, should increase greatly towards the centre, water acquir ing the density of quicksilver at 362 miles below the surface, and other things in proportion, and these densities becoming much greater at greater depths ; so that the entire mass of a cool globe should be of a gravity infinitely exceeding five and a half times the weight of water. The only alternative supposition is, that the central mate rials are greatly expanded or diffused by some means; and by what means could they be so expanded but by heat? Indeed, the existence of this central heat, a residuum of that which kept all matter in a vaporiform chaos at first, is amongst the most solid discoveries of modern science, (9) and the support which it gives to the nebular hypothesis is highly important. We shall here after see what have been supposed by some to be traces of an operation of this heat upon the sur face of the earth in very remote times ; an effect, however, which has long passed entirely away."], [57, "43 THE EARTH FORMED\u2014 GEOLOGICAL CHANGES. In our version of the romance of nature, we now descend from the consideration of orb-filled space and the character of the universal elements, to trace the history of our own globe. We shall see that it falls into connexion in an interesting manner with the primary order of things indicated by Laplace's Hypothesis. The nature of the materials of the externe or crust of our globe, is known to a greater depth than might be supposed, in consequence of the relation of position of its various masses. Con fused as these at first appear, an order of arrange ment, connected with time, has been detected in them by the labours of modern geologists. It is found that a certain kind of rock, below which"], [58, "44 THE EARTH FORMED : there is never, in ordinary circumstances, any other kind, is of crystaline character. Sometimes elevated in naked mountain masses, sometimes found only at great depths below other rocks of a different kind, Granite (for such is its name) appears as the basis rock of the earth's crust ; the form into which the once fluid matter of our planet was primarily resolved, although, in many instances, subjected, under heat, to new move ments at times long subsequent. The crystals of granite are of distinct substances \u2014 quartz, felspar, mica, and hornblende (each of which is, again, a combination of a certain number of the simple or elementary substances) : two of these, sometimes three, associated in various proportions, compose the rock, which thus appears in many varieties, passing under different names. Where granite does not appear upon the surface, or else some other igneous rock, such as will pre sently be adverted to, we find that great flooring overlaid with rocks of a different character and history \u2014 namely, what are called Aqueous or Sedi mentary Rocks. These are in the form of strata or beds, and have evidently been for the most part produced as a sediment of sand, clay, or other materials, at the bottom of seas, the matter"], [59, "GEOLOGICAL CHANGES. 45 being hardened by heat and pressure after its deposition. Whence the materials of these rocks? With some peculiar exceptions, each group of them has been derived from the substance of such rocks as were previously in existence, the earliest from the original granite, and so on in succession ; and this, by means of processes which continue in operation at the present day. That is to say, the atmosphere, by the chemical action of its mate rials, and the vapours with which it is charged, wears down whatever rocks are exposed to it; rivers carry the particles into the sea, the sea also erodes the rocks against which it impinges, and strews the matter along its bottom ; thus are sedi ments laid down, to be in time formed into rocks. Many of the earliest or lowest strata are obviously composed of material but slightly changed from the original granite ; such are all the rocks bearing the name of Gneiss. Others present the component materials in different combinations ; as, for instance, where, with clay derived from the felspar and the addition of mica, Micaceous Schist has been formed. Sometimes the quartz forms a sedimentary rock by itself. For such elections of materials, as they may be called, we see natural means of accounting, when we reflect that the"], [60, "46 THE EARTH FORMED : lightest particles of any substance suspended in moving water are liable to be earned most rapidly, and to the greatest distance. (10) It is also to be remarked of all these eai-ry rocks, that they have evidently been subjected to an extraordinary degree of heat, insomuch that they generally have acquired a new crystaline texture, are strangely waved and contorted, and often cannot be dis tinguished from the underlying granite, the ad jacent parts of which may sometimes be detected as having been placed there after the deposition of the aqueous rocks. Now the lowest stratified rocks are sometimes found lying in a nearly horizontal position, as they would be originally formed ; but more generally they are tilted up in high inclinations, with the broken edges directed towards granitic mountains ; indicating that the rise of these mountains from below was the cause of the change of position in the stratified rocks. Thus the earliest strata were in their turn exposed to the wearing influences of sea and atmosphere, and the materials appropriated to form new rocks. And, precisely as might be expected, these new rocks are laid down unconformably to the old ; that is, their verges rest at an angle against the sides of the senior formation. These new rocks"], [61, "GEOLOGICAL CHANGES. 47 are again, in their turn, broken up and placed in high inclinations by new and similar upbursts of igneous rock ; so as to become liable, of course, to similar disintegration. Such a repetition of wearings down and raisings up, implying frequent changes of land and sea, has been in reality the history of our globe since it took its present shape. A granitic crust, containing vast and pro found oceans, as is proved by the extent and thickness of the earliest strata, was the infant con dition of the earth. Points of unconformableness in the overlying aqueous rocks, connected with protrusions of granites, and other similar present ments of the internal igneous mass, such as trap and basalt, mark the conclusions of subsequent sections in this grand tale. Dates, such as chro nologists never dreamed of \u2014 compared with which those of Egypt's dynasties are as the latter to a child's reckoning of its birth-days \u2014 have thus been presented to the now living generation, in connexion with the history of our planet. The aqueous rocks, taken in their details, are a vast number. Geologists, however, group them in formations or systems, partly with reference to their lithological characters and the breaks in stratific arrangement above described, and partly with"], [62, "48 THE EARTH FORMED : regard to an entirely different class of particulars. It is now time to say that, from an early portion of the sedimentary rock series to its close, the mineral masses are found to enclose remains of the organic beings (plants and animals) which flourished upon earth during the time when the various strata were forming ; and these organisms, or such parts of them as were of sufficient solidity, have, in many instances, been preserved with the utmost fidelity, although for the most part con verted into the substance of the enclosing mineral. Now, as we pass along through the series of strata, we find a cessation of certain specific forms of plants and animals, while others come into view ; at some points, the change is almost complete \u2014 at others, it is very considerable. Such demarcations are taken into account by geologists in the grouping of the rock series. They speak of a Pal\u00e6ozoic Period, comprehending a large early section, terminating at a point where the specific forms are for the first time almost wholly changed; a Secondary Period, and a Tertiary Period, \u2014 these also giving groups of species all but distinct.

The Silurian System is so named, because a district in western England, where it is largely presented at the surface, and where it was first thoroughly examined, was that occupied in the time of the Romans by a people called the Silures. It is in reality developed much more extensively in Scandinavia and Russia, as well as other parts of the world. With us it is a series of clayey and arenaceous beds, of hard consistence ; but the characters are different in other countries.

But had they done so, they would quickly have had to admit that nature is simpler than man's wit would make her, for, be hold, the interrogation only brings before us the unpretending forms of a few humble sea-plants, certain zoophytes and polypiaria, and a variety of shelled marine animals ! To descend to particulars \u2014 Fucoids, or mark ings produced by fuci, a tribe of sea-plants, appear in the Lower Silurians of Russia, below any ascer tained animal remains, thus supporting the ob vious conclusion that vegetation must have started fully as early as animal life, since the one thing is necessary to the support of the other. In America, the same vegetable remains are pre sented in the very first ascertained fossiliferous strata; but in England they are not as yet found quite so early. In the Lower Silurians of Sweden, not only are there distinct impressions of such plants, but Professor Forchhammer speaks of courses of true coal, composed, as he thinks, of sea-weed, and gives an opinion that the alum- d 2"], [66, "52 LOWER AND UPPER SILURIAN FORMATIONS : slate of that country owes its combustible charac ter to the carbon, sulphur, and potash, derived from marine vegetation.

Next to them may be ranked certain humble animals (graptolites) allied to the sea-pens of modern seas, a family usually inha biting mud and slimy sediment in deep water. We come to creatures comparatively well or ganized, and yet still within the lowest division of the Animal Kingdom, when we speak of Cri noidea, which might be described as a lowly kind of star-fish, fixed on the top of a flexible stalk arising from the sea-bottom. Numberless cal careous plates enter into the composition of the stalk, body, and multitudinous tentacula or arms of the crinoid, forming altogether a wonderful ex ample of the elaborateness of pattern on which nature sometimes works ; and yet it is a very humble animal, \u2014 only, indeed, a stomach of"], [67, "FIRST FORMS OF LIFE. 53 one aperture, with arms wherewith to supply itself with food. The echinodermata, however, to which order it belongs, are the destructives of their grade ; and thus soon, it therefore appears, were animals set up as a police over the rest, to effect the great providential object of controlling the numbers of living beings. We have spoken of the Animal Kingdom and one of its divisions. It may be well here to state that these divisions have a reference to the grade and general character of the animals. An animal is said to be low, when its organization is of a simple kind, subservient to a comparatively nar row range of functions, and suited to a compara tively narrow field of existence, \u2014 if, like the polypes, for instance, and crinoids, it be fixed in situation, and consist mainly of an alimentary re ceptacle, with means of filling that with food. Elevation is marked in the scale, by an animal ceasing to be compound (which is the case of the coralline polypes), assuming a power of locomo tion, having sex assigned to separate individuals, exchanging a multiplicity of parts serving one end (as the many pairs of feet in the centipede) for a smaller number ; attaining, in short, at once a more complex ancl more concentrated organization."], [68, "54 LOWER AND UPPER SILURIAN FORMATIONS I On such grounds, the animal kingdom may be pri marily divided into Vertebrated and Invertebrated ; animals with a back -bone and the superior nervous system which that structure implies, and animals devoid of that structure and possessing a humbler nervous system. In the latter are placed, first, the rayed animals (Radiata) ; then, on one higher platform, the Articulata or jointed animals, as Crustacea, insects, spiders, \u2014 and the Mollusca, or pulpy animals, of which oysters, cowries, and cuttle-fish are examples.

Some which were found in a building stone at Lampeter, far down in the Lower Silurians, lie in a long coil, as they might be supposed to have laid themselves down to die upon the sea-bottom ; they are considered as allied to the nereis of the present seas. But by far the most conspicuous"], [69, "FIRST FORMS OF LIFE. 55 articulate of the early rocks is a member of the class Crustacea. This is the Trilobite, a marine animal to which the wood-louse makes the nearest approach in general figure, but marked by two groovings along the length of the body, so as to present atri-lobed form ; hence the name. The animal of our present seas most resembling it, is the limulus, or king crab. It is surprising how many species and even genera of the trilobite lived in the Silurian seas, and in what quantities their remains are found in va rious parts of the earth. The means of locomotion possessed by the animal are not known ; but from its form we must suppose it to have lived at the bottom of the sea, having its eyes directed upwards and sideways. The latter organs presenting facets such as are seen upon similar animals of our era, we may be said to have a proof furnished to us by this humble creature, \" that the water of those oceans and the supernatant atmosphere, was as transparent a medium at that time as it is at the present day, and that therefore no material per manent alteration can have resulted in either during the thousands of years which have elapsed since the creation of the animal world on this earth.\" (u) The trilobites stand low in the Crustacea, nor were"], [70, "56 LOWER AND UPPER SILURIAN FORMATIONS : any higher animals of that order (such as crabs, lobsters, &c.,) yet in existence. Of the division Mollusca, the predominant form in point of numbers was the bivalve order Bra chiopoda, which is now but slenderly represented upon earth. So numerous are the specimens in the Silurian rocks, that an eminent geologist calls this emphatically the Age of Brachiopods. (\u2022') The animal is a humble one, having two shells, not connected by a hinge, as is usual in superior bivalves, but kept together by a bundle of fibres. Its destiny is to remain fixed at the bottom of deep seas, and live upon nutritive particles, which it collects by means of two spiral-shaped arms, ex tending from the margin of its mouth, and from which the order has received its name. The superior abundance of life in the depths of the ocean, far from land, may be inferred, as a fact of this period, from the comparative number of the brachiopod fossils. Of univalves, which, generally speaking, rank above the bivalves, there are remains of all the three classes. The first and humblest, Pteropoda, most of which are naked, and therefore incapable of preservation in the fossil state, appear only in a few slight conical shells, indicating an animal"], [71, "57 FIRST FORMS OF LIFE. allied to the genus Criseis, still common in the Mediterranean. Of the next, Gasteropoda, there are many fossil species. There are also represen tatives of the last class, Cephalopoda, amongst which are now found some of the highest of the invertebrate animals, as the nautilus, cuttle-fish, and poulp. The cephalopods (orthoceratites, &c.) pursuing a free-swimming life, and highly organ ized for the catching and destroying of the weaker marine animals, were the lords of the organic world in their day. Such are the organisms of the Lower Silurian era, the first age of organization upon earth of which any very distinct memories have been left to us. There was as yet no sish nor any other kind of vertebrated animal, nor any creature which lived upon dry land. The zoology of the Upper Silurians is only different in as far as it presents, for the most part, new species of the same families, and a greater abundance of specimens ; one rock (Wenlock limestone) is a mere mass ofthe remains of corals, crinoids, and trilobites, held together by shale, and gives us, in England, a few obscure traces of fish. It is most remarkable how uni form has been the Fauna of the earth in those primitive ages. Silurian rocks have now been D 3"], [72, "58 LOWER AND UPPER SILURIAN FORMATIONS: examinedin England, Russia, Germany, and North America, with great care ; also in South America, the southern part of Africa, and even at the Falk land Islands, the very antipodes of Britain ; yet in no place has any essential difference of fossils been detected. Brachiopods, orthoceratites, trilo bites, are almost everywhere characteristic fossils. In the Alleghany mountains, in the hills of Here fordshire, on the slopes of the Ural chain, which divides Europe from Asia, we have remains of the same animal tribes. (19) There are differences of species \u2014 that is to say, the fossils of different re gions present certain minor peculiarities \u2014 but even this is only partial, and does not materially interfere with the general fact that there has been a remark able uniformity of life in the primeval seas. In the present era, it is hardly necessary to say, the case is very different. Even seas so near as the Red Sea and Mediterranean, present wholly diffe rent genera of mollusks. It has been thought that there might be a cause for the greater uniformity of life in those ages, in the greater uniformity of temperature, resulting from the as yet unspent heat of the surface, arising from the internal in candescence ; but perhaps the more probable cause was simply the comparative newness of life upon"], [73, "FIRST FORMS OF LIFE. 59 earth, and its little experience of those external agencies by which it is liable to be affected, and which, we shall see reason to believe, have operated in producing the many shades of variation which now mark the organic kingdoms."], [74, "60 DEVONIAN ERA\u2014 FISHES ABUNDANT. We now advance to a new chapter in this marvel lous history \u2014 that of the Devonian era. The term Devonian System is applied to an impor tant and conspicuous group of strata, overlying the Silurian, and largely developed \u2014 first in the South of Devonshire (whence the name), and in Cornwall, South Wales, Herefordshire, Shrop shire, and Worcestershire ; also in Scotland, the valley of the Rhine, Russia, and the western states of America ; besides, in all probability, many parts of the world as yet unexplored. In Scotland, the Great Grampian elevation, com posed of granite and gneissic rock, is skirted by a dense formation of conglomerate and red sand stone, extending in a sweep from Dumbarton to Stonehaven, and so on to Morayshire, Ross, and"], [75, "FISHES ABUNDANT. 61 Caithness. This passes by the general name of the Old Red Sandstone, which was at first used as an appellative for the system ; but it has latterly been abandoned, as redness is not found to be a prevailing peculiarity of the strata in other countries. In Russia, a surface as large as the whole of Great Britain is occupied by this forma tion. It reaches a thickness of ten thousand feet in England. The general forms of life prevalent in the Silu rian era are continued in the Devonian, with the remarkable addition of a large development of the humblest vertebrate class \u2014 Fishes. There is here, as there was in the Silurians, an abundance of zoophytes, corallines, crinoids, crustaceans, and mollusks, but mostly presenting those inferior variations which naturalists regard as constituting distinct species : speaking strictly, out of about eight hundred so-called species of the Silurian epoch, one hundred pass into the Devonian for mation, where, however, they gradually disappear, while new ones as gradually take their place. For such changes of species, adopting this word in the sense usually attached to it, geologists suggest causes in physical changes, as the rise of a sea-bottom by gradually filling up, or the intru-"], [76, "62 DEVONIAN ERA. sion of a new mineral material into the ocean, or one of a more decisive kind proceeding from such revolutions as are indicated by unconformable ness in the strata. But on this point much obscurity at present rests, for, as our survey is extended into other countries, it is found that extensive changes of species occur without any apparent dependence on at least some of these causes, so that, in these instances, some other explanation remains to be sought for. Corallines (favosites, cyathophylla, stromato pora) are amongst those genera which pass from the Silurians to the Devonians ; they are so abundant, as in some places to constitute entire strata, (Devonshire marbles.) The crinoids and trilobites are also continued as families through out this era. Of the latter we have a new species (brontes) marked by several new features, includ ing a set of claws resembling those of the common lobster, and the whole length of which is judged to have been not less than four feet. Some of the new brachiopods are of a very peculiar shape ; amongst the gasteropods are some which approach existing forms. The lordly cephalo poda continue to be largely represented, but in a considerable change of form ; for while the chief"], [77, "63 FISHES ABUNDANT. animals of this class in the Silurians (orthocera tites) had a simple, straight, or slightly curved shell, those new to the present era (as clymenia) had one forming a complete spiral. The most remarkable circumstance connected with the Devonian formation, is its presenting us with sish. A few faint traces of this class had, as we have seen, been presented in the Upper Silurians of our own country, though, it may be remarked, wanting in the corresponding rocks of Russia. We are now to see such memorials of them in the Devonian formation as show that the seas of that era had in many places swarmed with such inhabitants. M. Agassiz, of Neuf chatel, to whom the investigation of the subject has chiefly been committed, has ascertained upwards of a hundred species of Devonian fish, to which number it is to be expected that many additions will yet be made. The predominating fishes of this system, and the only ones which (as far as fossils show) existed for some ages, are arranged by M. Agassiz in tw*o orders, with a regard to their external covering, which that naturalist holds to be, in fishes, a reflection of the internal organiza tion. Both orders, it is to be remarked at the"], [78, "64 DEVONIAN ERA. very first, are manifestly of an inferior character to the two other orders which afterwards came into existence, and still are the principal fishes of our seas, these being covered by true scales, and respectively named ctenoid and cycloid, from thc forms of that part of their organization. The two orders of early fish are covered with integu ments considerably different in character ; the one (placoids) with irregular enamelled plates, the other (ganoids) with regular enamelled scales, the first being not placed over each other, as scales are, but laid edge to edge, in the manner of a pavement. These characters, according to M. Agassiz, were accompanied by a rudimentary or cartilaginous skeleton, while the ctenoids and cycloids possess an osseous structure. The cephalaspis has a longish tail-like body inserted within the cusp of a large crescent shaped head, somewhat like a saddler's cutting knife. The body is covered with strong plates of bone, enamelled, and the head was protected on the upper side with one large plate, as with a buckler \u2014 hence the name, implying buckler-head. A range of small fins conveys the idea of its having been as weak in motion as it is strong in structure. In the coccosteus, the outline of the"], [79, "FISHES ABUNDANT. 65 body is of the form of a short thick coffin, rounded, covered with strong bony plates, and terminating in a long tail, which seems to have been the sole organ of motion. While the tail establishes this creature among the vertebrata and the fishes, its teeth, chiselled, as it were, out of the solid bone of the jaw, like the nippers of a lobster, suggest its propinquity to the invertebrate part of creation. The pterichthys has also strong bony plates over its body, arranged much like those of a tortoise, and has a long tail ; but its most remarkable feature, and that which has suggested its name, is a pair of narrow wing-like appen dages attached to the shoulders, which the crea ture is supposed to have erected for its defence w*hen attacked by an enemy. A group of ganoids seem to have been the police of their day, possessing a powerful deve lopment of sharp conical teeth situated on the margin of the jaws. One genus, the holoptychius, introduced near the close of the Devonian era, and passing up into the next, presents a flat oval form, measuring in one specimen thirty inches by twelve, with a covering of strong plates, wavily grooved and overlapping each other, the head forming only a slight rounded projection from the"], [80, "66 DEVONIAN ERA. general figure. We here find another early and startling example, in addition to the brontes, of animals which may be called large. In the strata of this formation at Dorpat, there are gigantic bones, which were at first thought to belong to reptiles, but have since been ascertained to be remains of fishes, leading to the conjecture that the animals to which they appertained could not be less than thirty-six feet long.(19) M. Agassiz has lately announced nine genera of sharks of the division Cestraceon in the Devo nians of Russia. It is in this voracious family that we see the placoids represented in modern seas ; the ganoids are all but unrepresented in our time. Of both classes, one invariable pecu liarity has attracted much attention. \" In all recent fish, with the exception of the shark family, the sturgeon, and the bony pike, the vertebral column terminates at the point where the caudal fin is given off, and this fin is expanded above and below the body, forming what is called a homo cereal tail. In all those, without exception, which have been found in strata of the Pal\u00e6ozoic period, [placoids and ganoids,] the caudal fin is hetero cercal, being formed of two unequal branches, the upper one expanded immediately from the verte-"], [81, "FISHES ABUNDANT. 67 bral column, while the lower one is given off at a point some distance from the extremity.\" (20) Now it is a remarkable fact, that this one-sided tail is a peculiarity in the more perfect fishes (as the salmon) at a certain stage in their embryonic history ; as is also the inferior position of the mouth, peculiar to the early fishes. More than this : in the early periods of embryonic life, there is no vertebral column. This organ is represented in embryos by a gelatinous cord, called the dorsal cord, which in maturity disappears as the verte br\u00e6 are formed upon it. M. Agassiz has satisfied himself that this was the nature of the organiza tion of the early fishes, as it is that of the sturgeon of the present seas. It is not premature to remark how broadly these facts hint at the parity of law affecting the progress of general creation, and the progress of an individual foetus of one of the more perfect animals. (21) Another feature of the placoids, bringing them down towards the level of au inferior portion of the animal kingdom, is the distinct marks which the dermal plates bear, in many specimens, of processes for muscular attachments. This suggests a peculiarity of arti culate animals, and powerfully hints that the cartilaginous skeleton had not been, as in higher"], [82, "68 DEVONIAN ERA. vertebrata, the grand support of the frame, and the basis of its strength. An eminent geologist is of opinion that the species of this era vary locally, as far as might be expected from what we see of thc distribution of animal life in the present times. Nevertheless, throughout the distant parts of the earth where Devonian strata are found, the general characters of animal and also vegetable life are nearly the same. It is further observed, that whatever particular family is continued with little change through a succession of strata, is also amongst those most widely extended over the world. It is the opinion of M. Brongniart, who has distin guished himself by his investigation of vegetable fossils, that the fuci of these early seas indicate a higher temperature than now prevails at many of the places where they are found. He regards this as a proof of the more equable diffusion of a tropical climate in ancient times, and distinctly attributes it to the action of the internal heat of the earth. The early animals are not so uniform over large geographical areas as the plants. M. Agassiz surmises, from an examination of the fishes of the ancient seas, that the ocean did not at first contain much salt, but gradually acquired"], [83, "FISHES ABUNDANT. 69 its present infusion of that material ; a theory, it may be remarked, which derives support from the suggestion, that the salt of the sea has been mainly brought thither, in the course of time, by rivers, washing it in particles out of the land, in common with other detritus, while it is obvious that rain does not restore it.(22) It is easy to suppose a comparative absence of salt in the early ocean affecting animal and vegetable marine life in different ways and degrees. As yet \u2014 overlooking possible exceptions of a narrow and dubious kind (23) \u2014 we meet with no traces of land plants: remains of terrestrial animals have not even been suspected. This exclusively marine character of the flora and fauna of the early ages is usually thought to betoken the non-existence of dry land. But there are reasons apart from the fossil history for be lieving that great masses had been exposed to the atmosphere in those ages. The earliest strata give token of vast disintegration. In our time, this process is usually seen taking place chiefly in the atmosphere, and at the point where land and water meet; in a much less activity below the surface of the ocean. It would thus appear likely that there was dry land in the eras of the"], [84, "70 DEVONIAN ERA. earliest stratified formations, though, from what ever cause, it bore no vegetation and sustained no animals, or was only a scene of life in certain rare and favourably situated places. The ages of mountains, from which this inference is derived, form one of the most curious as well as trust worthy chapters in geological science. It is as certain that the Grampian mountains of Scotland are older than the Alps and Apennines, as it is that civilization had visited Italy, and had enabled her to subdue the world, while Scotland was the resi dence of \" roving barbarians.\" The Pyrenees, Carpathians, and other ranges of continental Europe, are all younger than the Grampians, or even the insignificant Mendip Hills of southern England. Stratification tells this tale as plainly as Livy tells the history of the Roman republic. It tells us \u2014 to use the words of Professor Phillips \u2014 that at the time when the Grampians sent streams and detritus to straits where now the valleys of the Forth and Clyde meet, the greater part of Europe was a wide ocean."], [85, "71 CARBONIGENOUS ERA. COMMENCEMENT OF LAND PLANTS. The next group of rocks is called the Car boniferous Formation, from the remarkable fea ture of its numerous interspersed beds of coal. It commences with the beds of the mountain lime stone, which, in some situations, as in Derbyshire and Ireland, are of great thickness, being alter nated with chert, (a siliceous sandstone,) sand stones, shales, and beds of coal, generally of the harder and less bituminous kind, (anthracite,) the whole being covered in some places by the mill stone grit, a siliceous conglomerate, composed of the detritus of the earliest formation. The moun tain limestone, attaining in England to a depth of eight hundred yards, greatly exceeds in volume any of the primary limestone beds, and shows an enormous addition of power to the causes con-"], [86, "72 CARBONIGENOUS ERA. nected with animal life, by which this substance is supposed to have been produced. In fact, distinct remains of corals, crinoidea, and shells, are so abundant in it, as to compose three-fourths of the mass in some parts. Above the mountain limestone commence the more conspicuous coal beds, alternating with sandstones, shales, beds of limestone, and iron stone. Coal is altogether composed of the matter of a terrestrial vegetation, transmuted by putre faction of a peculiar kind, beneath the surface of water and in the absence of air. Some estuary shells have been found in it, but few of pelagic origin, and no remains of those zoorihytes and crinoidea so abundant in the mountain limestone and other rocks. Coal beds exist in Europe, Asia, and America, and have hitherto been es teemed as the most valuable of mineral produc tions, from the important services which the sub stance renders in manufactures and in domestic economy. It is to be remarked, that there are some local variations in the arrangement of coal beds. In France, they rest immediately on the granite and other primary rocks, the intermediate strata not having been found at those places. In other countries, traces of coal are found in the"], [87, "COMMENCEMENT OF LAND PLANTS. 73 Devonian formation. These last circumstances may only show that different parts of the earth's surface did not all witness the same events of a certain fixed series exactly at the same time. Some features of the condition of the earth during the deposition of the carboniferous group, are made out with a clearness which must satisfy most minds. First, we are told of a time when carbonate of lime was formed in vast abundance along the shores and islands of the ocean, accom panied by an unusually large population of corals and encrinites ; while in some parts of the earth there were pieces of dry land covered with a luxu riant vegetation. Next, we have a comparatively brief period of volcanic disturbance, (when the conglomerate was formed.) Then the causes favourable to the so abundant production of lime stone, and the large population of marine radiata, decline, and we find the masses of dry land in crease in number and extent, and begin to bear an amount of forest vegetation, far exceeding that of the most sheltered tropical spots of the present surface. The climate, even in the latitude of Baffin's Bay, was torrid ; and the atmosphere has been supposed by some to have contained a larger charge of carbonic acid gas (the material of vege- E"], [88, "74 CARBONIGENOUS ERA. tation) than it now does. The forests or thickets of the period included no plants specifically the same with those now known upon earth. They mainly consisted of gigantic vegetables, many of which are not represented by any existing types, while others are akin to kinds, which, in temperate climes at least, are now only found in small and lowly forms. That these forests grew upon a Polynesia, or multitude of small islands, is con sidered probable, from similar vegetation being now found in such situations within the tropics. With regard to the circumstances under which the masses of vegetable matter were transformed into successive coal strata, geologists are divided. From examples seen at the present day, at the mouths of such rivers as the Mississippi, which traverse extensive sylvan regions, and from other circumstances to be adverted to, it is held likely by some that the vegetable matter, the rubbish of decayed forests, was carried by rivers into estuaries, and there accumulated in vast natural rafts, until it sunk to the bottom, where an over lay of sand or mud would prepare it for becoming a stratum of coal. Others conceive that the vege tation first passed into the condition of a peat moss, that a subsidence then exposed it to be"], [89, "COMMENCEMENT OF LAND PLANTS. 75 overrun by the sea, and covered with a layer of sand or mud ; that a subsequent uprise made the mud dry land, and fitted it to bear a new forest, which afterwards, like its predecessors, became a bed of peat ; that, in short, by repetitions of this process, the alternate layers of coal, sandstone, and shale, constituting the carboniferous group, were formed. It is favourable to this last view that marine fossils are rarely found in the body of the coal itself, though abundant in the shale layers above and below it ; also that in several places erect stems of trees are found with their roots still fixed in the shale beds, and crossing the sandstone beds at almost right angles, showing that these, at least, had not been drifted from their original situations. On the other hand, it is not easy to admit such repeated risings and sinkings of sur face as would be required, on this hypothesis, to form a series of coal strata. Perhaps w7e may most safely rest at present with the supposition that coal has been formed under both classes of circumstances, though in the latter only as an ex ception to the former. The plants of the carbonigenous period have been investigated with great care by several able naturalists, and above eight hundred species have e 2"], [90, "76 CARBONIGENOUS ERA. been ascertained. The living plants of our own era are at least 80,000, and it is difficult to suppose the flora of that remote age to have been so much more limited. It must, however, be observed, that there are many conceivable circumstances to ac count for the non-preservation or transmission of many of the plants of this era. The numerous fungi, and other lowly forms, could scarcely have left clear memorials of themselves in the rocks, or in the masses of coals ; and it has even been ascer tained by experiment, that some of the highest forms of vegetation perish with surprising quick ness in water. If we might assume, nevertheless, that the plants actually ascertained, form in any degree a representation of the flora of this period, they would imply that the early terrestrial botany of our globe was greatly less varied than the pre sent, and composed chiefly of plants of compara tively simple form and structure.^4) In the ranks of the vegetable kingdom, the lowest place is taken by plants of cellular tissue, and which have no flowers, (crgptogamia,) as sea weeds, lichens, mosses, fungi, ferns. Above these, stand plants with vascular tissue, and bearing flowers, in which again there are two great sub divisions; first, plants having one seed-lobe,"], [91, "COMMENCEMENT OF LAND PLANTS. 77 (monocotyledons,) and in which the new matter is added within, (endogenous \u2014 the cane and palm are examples ;) second, plants having two seed lobes, (dicotyledons,) and in which the new matter is added on the outside under the bark, (exogenous \u2014 the pine, elm, oak, and all the British forest trees are examples ;) these subdivisions also rank ing in the order in which they are here stated. Now it is found that the predominant plants of the coal era are of the cellular and cryptogamic kind, while the dicotyledons are comparatively rare. There is, indeed, one exogenous family, w7hich occurs in considerable numbers, and, perhaps, figured more conspicuously in the living woods than in the dead coal beds \u2014 namely, the conifers ; but this, again, is held as the lowest family of its class. That many trees of higher families now existed, seems unlikely, when we learn that such trees occur in considerable numbers in subsequent formations, showing that there was nothing posi tively to forbid their being preserved in the coal measures, if they had then existed. The master-form or type of the era was the fern or breckan, of which about one hundred and thirty species have been ascertained as entering into the composition of coal. The ferns are plants which"], [92, "78 CARBONIGENOUS ERA. thrive best in warm, shaded, and moist situations. In tropical countries, where these conditions abound, there are many more species than in tem perate climes, and some of these are arborescent, or of a tree-like size and luxuriance. (25) The ferns of the coal strata have been of this magnitude, and that without regard to the regions ofthe earth where they are found. In the coal of Baffin's Bay, of Newcastle, and of the torrid zone, alike, are the fossil ferns arborescent, showing that, in that era, the present tropical temperature, or one even higher, existed in very high latitudes. In the swamps and ditches of England there grows a plant called the horse-tail, (equisetum,) having a succulent, erect, jointed stem, with slender leaves, and a scaly catkin at the top. A second large section of the plants of the carboniferous era were of this kind, (equisetace\u0153,) but, like the ferns, reaching the magnitude of trees. While existing equiseta rarely exceed three feet in height, and the stems are generally under half an inch in dia meter, their kindred, entombed in the coal beds, seem to have been generally fourteen or fifteen feet high, with stems from six inches to a foot in thickness. It is to be remarked that plants of this kind (forming two genera, the most abundant of"], [93, "COMMENCEMENT OF LAND PLANTS. 79 which is the catamites) are only represented on the present surface by plants ofthe same family: the species w*hich flourished at this era gradually lessen in number as we advance upwards in the series of rocks, and disappear before we arrive at the ter tiary formation. The club-moss family (lycopodiace\u00e6) are other plants of the present surface, usually seen in a lowly and creeping form in temperate latitudes, but presenting species which rise to a greater mag- nitude within the tropics. Many specimens of this family are found in the coal beds ; it is thought they have contributed more to the substance of the coal than any other family. But like the ferns and equisetace\u00e6, they rise to a prodigious magnitude. The lepidodendron (so the fossil genus is called, from the scaly exterior) has probably been from sixty-five to eighty feet in height, having at the base a diameter of about three feet, while the leaves measured twenty inches in length. In the forests of the coal era, the lepidodendra wrould enjoy the rank of firs in our forests, affording shade to the only less stately ferns and calamites. The internal structure of the stem, and the character of the seed-vessels, show them to have been a link be tween single-lobed anddouble-lobed plants \u2014 a fact"], [94, "80 CARBONIGENOUS ERA. worthy of note, as it favours the idea of a progress in vegetable creation, in the line of an improved organization. It is also curious to find a missing sink of so much importance in a genus of plants which has long ceased to have a living place upon earth. The other leading plants of the coal era are without representatives on the present surface, and their characters are in general less clearly ascertained. Amongst the most remarkable are \u2014 the sigillaria, of which large stems are very abundant, showing that the interior has been soft, and the exterior fluted, with separate leaves in serted in vertical rows along the flutings \u2014 and the stigmaria, a plant apparently calculated to flourish in marshes, or pools, having a short, thick, fleshy stem, with a dome-shaped top, from which sprung branches of from twenty to thirty feet long. Amongst monocotyledons were some palms, (Jlabellaria and n\u0153ggerathia,) besides a few not distinctly assignable to any class. The conifers of the coal are comparatively rare, and are only as yet found in isolated cases, and in sandstone beds. One discovered in the Craig leith quarry, near Edinburgh, consisting of a stem about two feet thick, and forty-seven feet in"], [95, "COMMENCEMENT OF LAND PLANTS. 81 length. Others were afterwards found, both in the same situation, and at Newcastle. Leaves and fruit being wanting, an ingenious mode of detecting the nature of these trees was devised by some naturalists residing in the northern capitals26) Taking thin polished cross slices of the stem, and subjecting them to the microscope, they detected the structure of the wood to be that of a cone-bearing tree, by the presence of certain \" reticulations\" which distinguish that family, in addition to the usual radiating and concentric lines. That particular tree was concluded to be an araucaria, a genus now found in Norfolk Island, in the South Sea, and in a few other re mote situations. The conifers of this era may be said to form the dawn of dicotyledonous trees, to which, it has already been noticed, the lepido dendra are a link from the monocotyledons. The concentric rings of the Craigleith and other coni fers of this era have been mentioned. It is inte resting to find in these a record of the changing seasons of those early ages, when as yet there were no human beings to observe time and tide. The rings are clearly traced; but it is observed that they are more slightly marked than is the case with their family at the present day, as if the E 3"], [96, "82 CARBONIGENOUS ERA. changes of temperature had been within a nar rower range. Such (if we are to be allowed to rest with posi tive evidence) was the vegetation of the carboni genous era, composed of forms low in the botanical scale, mostly flowerless and fruitless, but luxu riant and abundant beyond what the most favoured spots on earth can now show. The rigidity of the leaves of its plants, and the absence of fleshy fruits and farinaceous seeds, unfitted it to afford nutriment to animals ; and, monotonous in its forms, and destitute of brilliant colouring, its sward probably unenlivened by any of the smaller flowering herbs, its shades uncheered by the music of birds, it must have been a sombre scene to a human visitant. But neither man nor any other animals were then in existence to look for such uses or such beauties in this vegetation. It was serving other and equally important ends, clearing perhaps the atmosphere of matter noxious to ani mal life, and certainly storing up mineral masses which were in long subsequent ages to prove of the greatest service to the human race, even to the extent of favouring the progress of its civiliza tion. Traces of land plants previous to the Carboni-"], [97, "COMMENCEMENT OF LAND PLANTS. 83 genous era are isolated at the best, and, till we know more about them, they cannot be allowed greatly to affect our views of the botanical history of the globe. Geologists speak of a fern leaf in the Silurians of Wales ; in those of America, a plant apparently allied to the lepidodendron ; in the American lower Devonian, some allied to ferns. These phenomena, if fully established, would not interfere with general deductions from the mass of early land vegetation found in the coal era. There might be patches of vegetation long before the time of the great coal flora ; and from such pieces of land might those early speci mens have been wafted. The Carboniferous formation exhibits a scanty zoology compared with either those which go before, or those winch come after. The mountain limestone, indeed, deposited at the commence ment of it, abounds unusually in polypiaria, cri noidea, and mollusca ; but when we ascend to the coal-beds themselves, the case is altered. We have then only a limited variety of shell mollusks, with fragments of a few species of fishes, and these are rarely or never found in the coal seams, but in the shales alternating with them. Among the fishes, the conspicuous form is the Sauroid"], [98, "84 CARBONIGENOUS ERA. family, which receives its name in consequence of a character of teeth, scales, and even osteology, re sembling that of the Sauria, and evidently leading on to that section of reptiles, if) One of the most noted species is the Megalichthys Hibbertii, dis covered by Dr. Hibbert Ware, in a limestone bed at Burdiehouse, near Edinburgh, and of which other specimens have been found in the coal measures of Yorkshire, and low coal shales of Newcastle. The enormous size of the animal is inferred from teeth belonging to it, not less than four inches long. At this point we find the first traces of land animals, in the fossil remains of ter restrial insects (28) and the foot-prints of reptiles, the first in England, the latter in America^29) Coal strata are nearly confined to the group termed the carboniferous formation. Thin beds are not unknown afterwards, but they occur only as a rare exception. It is therefore thought that the most important of the conditions which allowed of so abundant a terrestrial vegetation \u2014 whatever these were \u2014 had ceased about the time when this formation was completed. The termination of the carboniferous formation is marked in some regions by symptoms of great disturbance. Coal-beds generally lie in basins,"], [99, "85 COMMENCEMENT OF LAND PLANTS. as if following the curve of the bottom of seas. There is no such basin which is not broken up into pieces, some of which have been tossed up on edge, others allowed to sink, causing the ends of strata to be in some instances many yards, and in a few, several hundred feet, removed from the corresponding ends of neighbouring fragments. These are held to be results of volcanic move ments below, the operation of which is further seen in numerous upbursts and intrusions of fire born rock, (trap.) That these disturbances took place about the close of the formation, and not later, is shown in the fact of the next higher group of strata being comparatively undisturbed. Other symptoms of this time of violence are seen in the beds of conglomerate which occur amongst the first strata above the coal. These, as usual, consist of fragments of the elder rocks, more or less worn from being tumbled about in agitated water, and laid down in a mud paste, afterwards hardened. (30) It is to be admitted for strict truth, that in some parts of Europe the carboniferous formation is followed by superior deposits, with out the appearance of such disturbances between their respective periods; but such cases appa rently are exceptive."], [100, "86 PERMIAN ERA. PERMIAN ERA. FIRST TRACES OF REPTILES. In this subordinate manner, may be noticed a short series of strata, following, whether con formably or otherwise, upon the carboniferous formation, and to which a general name has been applied, from its being unusually well developed in the portion of Russia which formed the ancient kingdom of Permia. This sub-formation \u2014 com prehending in ascending order a group of sand stones, called with us the Lower New Red Sand stones, and amongst the Germans Rothe-todte liegende (31) \u2014 a thick calcareous bed called with us the Magnesian Limestone, by the Germans Zech stein, \u2014 and some other strata \u2014 is, in respect of fossils, a continuation of the carboniferous system. With it, however, ends a range of animal forms which first appeared in the Silurians, and passed, with the changes winch have been indicated, through the Devonian and Carbonigenous eras. The total number of specific forms, which had been diminishing in the carbonigenous era, is in this still further reduced ; one recent author says, from about a thousand to a hundred and sixty six, of which only eighteen are common to the"], [101, "FIRST TRACES OF REPTILES. 87 inferior strata. (32) It appears as if, while some new species continued to present themselves, the animal kingdom were now generally undergoing a decay, for even specimens of particular families are less abundant than formerly. Instead, for example, of the hundred species of corals of the carboniferous formation, there were now only fifteen, and of these but three or four abundant. Of the numerous crinoidea of the past, but one now remained, and this is rarely found. The trilobite has now vanished, to appear no more. For hundreds of brachiopods, there were now only thirty, ten of them old. The cephalopods almost disappear at the very commencement of the Permian era. It cannot at present be determined whether this diminution of fossils is owing to an actual reduc tion of the amount of life in the ancient seas, or only to some such simple cause as the occurrence of deposits which were not favourable to the pre servation of animal remains. It may even be that the principal cemeteries of the age have not yet been hit upon by research; for certainly this is neither the most extensively nor the most rigidly examined of the various formations, and we are made the more suspicious by finding that, at this"], [102, "88 PERMIAN ERA. part of the rock series, several important fossili ferous strata are present in one region and not in others. It has been ascertained, however, by Permian researches, that extensive changes of specific forms in the ancient seas were not, as has been supposed, necessarily and essentially connected with great physical disturbances ; for both do we find that the unconformability of strata or memorials of disturbance between the carboniferous and Permian do not affect the fossils, and that a conformable succession of strata over the Permian is attended by a great \u2014 usually called a complete \u2014 change of species. At this termination of the Permian, modern geo logists close what they call the Pal\u00e6ozoic Period, on a supposition that an ancient creation had now passed away, to give place to one entirely new. And this view is eagerly embraced by those who argue for repeated interferences of creative power. But not only is such a notion discoun tenanced by the nature of the subsequent organ isms, an advance to higher species of particular classes, and to a new class the next in the animal scale, but it is utterly overthrown by the recent discovery of plants in the higher formations, (Trias of France and certain Liassic beds in the Alps,) identical with carboniferous species. Where such"], [103, "FIRST TRACES OF REPTILES. 89 changes of fossils occur, the more reasonable sup position is, that notwithstanding conformableness of strata, a local suspension of deposits for a con siderable time is indicated \u2014 a time during which the usual changes of species were proceeding, probably at their usual rate, and which was sufficient to present something like a complete change of forms when the deposits were re-com menced. (M) In the Permian formation, besides the principal orders of animals which previously existed, we have the first undoubted traces of another, suc ceeding fish in the animal scale \u2014 namely, Reptiles. This is a most important point in our history, for it gives us, for the first time, a class of verte brate animals capable of breathing the atmosphere and walking upon the land. We shall presently see that it was a class destined for a long suc cession of ages to flourish over the soil, in many various and some most formidable shapes, and without any superiors to keep them in check. As yet, but a few bones of reptiles have been dis covered in the Zechstein of Thuringia in Upper Saxony, and in quarries near Bristol. By Pro fessor Owen, who has carefully examined them, they are said to be of the lacertilian or lizard order (specifically called by him, pal\u00e6osaurs,"], [104, "90 PERMIAN ERA. thecodonts, monitors, &c), but for the most part of gigantic size, and differing from modern lizards in very remarkable characters of the vertebr\u00e6, teeth, and dermal plates. To them, as to all the reptiles of this and several subsequent great periods, belonged a fish-like form of the vertebral column, in as far as its component bones were biconcave, or shaped like a double egg-cup, a peculiarity regarded by this eminent anatomist as probably fitting the animal for partially marine habits. And that the full importance of this pe culiarity of the early reptiles may be appreciated, the reader must be made aware that modern rep tiles have a ball-and-socket form of the vertebr\u00e6 \u2014 that is, a convexity at the one side fitting into the hollow of the adjacent bone ; but this form only when they are mature animals, for in the embryotic state of the crocodile and of the frog the form has been ascertained to be biconcave, which gradually changes as the animal approaches perfection. The teeth of the thecodonts and pal\u00e6osaurs were fixed in distinct sockets, like those of the modern croco diles. In this respect, they were superior to the modern varanians, the nearest living tribes, which have the teeth imbedded in comparatively shallow cavities along the bottom of a groove in the jaw."], [105, "91 ERA OF THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. REPTILES ABUNDANT. FIRST TRACES OF BIRDS AND MAMMALIA. Geologists now apply the term Secondary Forma tion (once of wider application) to those inter vening between the end of the Permian or close of what they call the Pal\u00e6ozoic Period, and the termination of the Chalk Series, afterwards to be described, at which place there is another and almost total change of specific forms. The first of these formations is called with us the Upper New Red Sandstone; it consists, in England, of only a group of strata of that kind, surmounted by some variegated marls. But on the Continent, below a stratum equivalent to these marls, there is one of limestone, bearing the name of the"], [106, "92 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. Muschelhalk, and full of shells. The system is there called Trias, on account of its thus con sisting of a triple group of strata. TRIAS. The organic relics of this system are most abun dant in the Muschelkalk. There we are presented with a great number of crinoids and shells, all differing in specific character from their prede cessors of the same orders. The crinoid called, from its elegant lily-like shape, Encrinites Monili formis, is a conspicuous fossil. The brachiopods, here almost extinct, are replaced by ostracea of various genera \u2014 a change from the animals of deep to those of shallow seas. The univalve mollusks also indicate a condition of the sea ad vancing towards that which exists near the present shores. In the new forms of cephalopoda are some marking their advanced character by their non-possession of a shell or stony skeleton. In this case, the existence of the animal is only betrayed by its horny mandible, constituting the fossils called rhyncholites. We find in this system further traces, but still"], [107, "REPTILES ABUNDANT. 93 obscure and local, of the reptilian class. Before proceeding to speak of them, it is necessary to remark that the ingredients and arrangements of rocks, with fossil remains, do not form the sole materials of the history compiled by the geologist. He is equally contented when he can find an intelligible fact told by what may be called a writing of nature upon these stone tablets. So low as the bottom of the carboniferous system, slabs are found marked over a great extent of surface with that peculiar corrugation or wrinkling w'hich the receding tide leaves upon a sandy beach when the sea is but slightly agitated ; and not only are these ripple-marks, as they are called, found on the surfaces, but casts of them appear on the under sides of slabs lying above. The phenomena suggest the time when the sand, ultimately formed into these stone slabs, was part of the beach of a sea of the carbonigenous era ; when, left wavy by one tide, it was covered over with a thin layer of ftesh sand by the next, and so on, precisely as such circumstances might be ex pected to take place at the present day. Sand stone surfaces, ripple-marked, present themselves throughout the subsequent formations ; in those of the New Red, at more than one place in Eng-"], [108, "94 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. land, they further bear impressions of rain-drops which have fallen upon them \u2014 the rain, of course, of the inconceivably remote age in which the sandstones were formed. In the Greensill sand stone, near Shrewsbury, it has even been possible to tell from what direction the shower came which impressed the sandy surface, the rims of the marks being somewhat raised on one side, exactly as might be expected from a slanting shower falling at this day upon one of our beaches. These facts have the same kind of interest as the season rings of the Craigleith conifers, speaking of the identity of the familiar processes of nature in those early ages with those of our own. Hearing of memorials of this kind will prepare the reader to learn that the earliest intelligence we have respecting land-walking animals consists, in great part, of their mere footsteps, impressed on the wet sand or mud, which afterwards became rock. Let no one undervalue such testimony. The fidelity of an impression from a foot, as cer tifying by what or whose foot the impression was made, is acknowledged in judicial procedure ; and often has this kind of evidence fixed the opinion of judge and jury, when every other has failed. So much being premised, we proceed to ex-"], [109, "REPTILES ABUNDANT. 95 amine the Triassic reptiles. In the lower beds of the upper new red sandstone, near Shrewsbury, we are introduced to a new lacertilian, presenting some remarkable characters, and named the Rhynchosaurus. From the few fragments of the animal which have been discovered, it would ap pear to have had a toothless head, resembling that of a bird, and enclosed in a bony sheath ; also a hinder toe directed backwards, in which feature we also see an assimilation to the next higher vertebrate class. Footmarks, impressed in the way which has been described, and attributed to this animal, confirm the appearances presented by the extraordinary arrangement of its loco motive organs. In the same beds occur a few bones, and a great number of footsteps, which Professor Owen has fixed as the double memorials of a group of animals, to which he has given (from the structure of their teeth) the name of Labyrinthodonts, and which he classes with the Batrachia, \u2014 that order of reptiles to which the frog and toad belong. Those who are accustomed to regard this as a group of generally small and insignificant animals, will be surprised to learn that the labyrinthodonts were of the size of a large hog. Their footmarks,"], [110, "96 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. discovered alike in America and the elder conti nent, \" bear a singular resemblance to the impres sion that would be made by the palm and expanded fingers and thumb of the human hand.\" But it is evident that the fore extremities of the animal had been, like those of the kangaroo and some other genera, much smaller than the hinder, some specimens of which measure eight inches by five. These batrachia present affinities to the fish class in their biconcave vertebr\u00e6 and the formation and arrangement of the teeth. Their nostrils being also, like those ofthe Sauria, placed near the extremity of the head, indicate a par tially marine habitat, such an arrangement being required to enable the animal to breathe while nearly altogether sunk in the water. Quarries of the red sandstone of this system also present an abundance of footmarks attributed to tortoises, thus pointing to the contemporaneous existence of a third order of reptiles, the Chelonia. The first examples were discovered by the Rev. Dr. Duncan in the quarry of Corncockle Muir, Dumfriesshire, where the slabs incline at an angle of thirty-eight degrees, and the footmarks are dis tinctly traced up and down the slope, as if, when the surfaces were those of a beach \u2014 at, however,"], [111, "REPTILES ABUNDANT. 97 a lower inclination \u2014 the animal had had occasion to pass only in that direction, in its daily visits to the sea. Some slabs similarly impressed, in the Stourton quarries, Cheshire, are further marked with a shower of rain which we know to have fallen afterwards, for its little hollows are impressed in the footmarks also, though more slightly than on the rest of the surface, the com parative hardness of a trodden place having apparently prevented so deep an impression being made. It is in the celebrated Muschelkalk that, for the first time, we find examples of a group of reptiles which have excited more attention than perhaps any other fossil animals. The same group, it may be remarked, occurs in the English lias and subsequent formations ; but the mere fact of writ ing in England should not make us postpone to that place an order of beings which we find earlier in another portion of what, geologically, may* be regarded as but one great zoological pro vince. These animals, called collectively Enalio sauria, or Marine Saurians, abounded throughout a long period of the earth's history, while mam malian life was yet hardly developed ; but they disappeared in what we shall have to speak of as F"], [112, "98 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. the Cretaceous Era. The Ichthyosaur, of which ten species have been distinguished, was an animal of marine habits and great bulk, (reaching about thirty feet in length,) in which to the form of the fish there were united, in a remarkable way, characters of animals higher in the scale. A body, framed upon a purely piscine vertebral column, containing a huge voracious stomach, and terminating in a vertically expanded tail, in which respect it also preserved the fish character, was furnished with the head of a crocodile, and four fins approximating to the character ofthe paddles of the whale, but composed of a greater number of bones, and thus showing an affinity to the fins of fishes. Over all was a skin resembling that of the cetaceous animals. Nor should it be omitted that the sternum or breast-bone presents a struc ture resembling that of the ornithorhynchus or duck-rat of Australia. The vast jaws of this animal, having a stretch of seven feet; its eye resting in a socket eighteen inches in diameter, and defended by an apparatus of bony plates, like that of a bird of prey ; the powerful range of teeth, and the position of the breathing apertures near the extremity of the snout ; all speak to the naturalist of ferocious habits like those of the"], [113, "REPTILES ABUNDANT. 99 modern crocodile, to which the Ichthyosaur may be considered as a link from the predaceous fish. A curious light has been thrown upon these habits by the pellets voided by the animal, which have been found in great quantities in a fossilized state, and bear the name of coprolites. In these we find fragments not only of fish, but of reptiles, arguing that the animal must have been a de structive creature both to its own class and to that below it. The genus next in importance is the Plesio saurus, so called as being near to the saurian character. This animal was under eighteen feet long, and altogether a feebler creature than the Ichthyosaur, which seems to have made it a prey. Yet it was itself one of the destructive potentates of the early seas. A body, generally fish-like, though framed on vertebr\u00e6 presenting less con cave ends, and which terminated in a short tail, serving only as a rudder, was furnished with a long neck and small head, together with four slender paddles, more cetacean than those of the Ichthyosaur. Moving, like that animal, quickly in the water, by means of the special organs designed for the purpose, the Plesiosaur would have a further advantage in its long, flexible, F 2"], [114, "100 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. serpent-like neck ; but the small size of the head, though there we find the same superior arrange ment of teeth seen in the thecodonts, must have rendered it a much less formidable creature than that last described. Professor Owen regards it as fitted to live near shores and to ascend estuaries. The attention of the geologists of the United States has been called to certain footmarks in the sandstones ofthe valley of Connecticut, indicative, as they think, of birds of the orders Grallatores (waders) and Rasores (scrapers.) \" The footsteps appear in regular succession on the continuous track of an animal, in the act of walking or run- ning, with the right and left foot always in their relative places. The distance of the intervals be- tween each footstep on the same track is occa- sionally varied, but to no greater amount than may be explained by the bird having altered its pace. Many tracks of different individuals and different species are often found crossing each other, and crowded, like impressions of feet upon the shores of a muddy stream, where ducks and geese re- sort.'^34) Some of these prints indicate small ani- mals, but others denote birds of what would now be an unusually large size, one having a foot fif teen inches in length, and a stride of from four to"], [115, "REPTILES ABUNDANT. 101 six feet. There are anomalies in the forms of some of the feet ; but their being the vestiges of birds has for some years been generally admitted. There is, however, some uncertainty regarding the date of the rocks which present these memorials, for the phenomena of superposition only denote their being between the carboniferous and creta ceous formations, and an exact place is assigned them, merely upon the strength of the discovery that they present fish of certain genera never found above the Triassic series. Along with dis tinctly ornithic footmarks are those of the Laby rinthodont. Altogether, above thirty species of Triassic birds are made out from these vestiges by American geologists. OOLITE. The chronicles of this period consist of a series of beds, mostly calcareous, taking their general name (Oolite system) from a conspicuous member of them \u2014 the oolite \u2014 a limestone composed of an aggregation of small round grains or spherules, and so called from its fancied resemblance to a"], [116, "102 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. cluster of eggs, or the roe of a fish. This texture of stone is novel and striking. It is supposed to be of chemical origin, each spherule being an aggregation of particles round a central nucleus. The oolite system is largely developed in Eng land, France, Westphalia, and Northern Italy ; it appears in Northern India and Africa, and patches of it exist in Scotland, and in the vale of the Mississippi. It may of course be yet dis covered in many other parts of the world. The series, as shown in the neighbourhood of Bath, is (beginning with the lowest) as follows : 1. Lias, a set of strata variously composed of limestone, clay, marl, and shale, clay being pre dominant ; 2. Lower oolitic formation, including, besides the great oolitic bed of central England, Fullers'-earth beds, Forest marble, and Cornbrash ; 3. Middle oolitic formation, composed of two sub groups, the Oxford clay and Coral Rag, the latter being a mere layer of the works of the coral polype; 4. Upper oolitic formation, including what are called Kimmeridge clay and Portland oolite. In Yorkshire there is an additional group above the lias, and in Sutherlandshire there is another group above that again. In the wealds (moorlands) of Kent and Sussex, there is, in like"], [117, "REPTILES ABUNDANT. 103 manner, above the fourth of the Bath series, an other additional group, to which the name of the Wealden has been given, from its topographical situation, and which, composed of sandstones and clays, is subdivided into Purbeck beds, Hastings sand, and Weald clay. There are no particular appearances of dis turbance between the close of the Trias, and the beginning of the Lias and Oolite system, as far as has been observed in England. Yet there is a great change in the materials of the rocks of the two formations, showing that, while the bottoms of the seas of the one period had been chiefly arenaceous, those of the other were chiefly clayey and limey. And there is an equal difference be tween the two periods in respect of both botany and zoology. While the Permian and Triassic systems, with the single exception of the Mus chelkalk, show comparatively scanty traces of life, those in the lias and oolite are extremely* abun dant, particularly in the department of animals, and more particularly still of sea mollusca. The distinguishing characters of the zoology appear to be uniform over a great space. \" In the equi valent deposits in the Himalayan Mountains, at Fernando Po, in the region north of the Cape of"], [118, "104 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. Good Hope, and in the Run of Cutch, and other parts of Hindostan, fossils have been discovered, which, as far as English naturalists who have seen them can determine, are undistinguisbable from certain oolite and lias fossils of Europe.\" (35) The dry land of this age presented cycade\u00e6, \"a beautiful class of plants between the palms and conifers, having a tall, straight trunk, terminating in a magnificent crown of foliage.\" (30) There were tree ferns, but in smaller proportion than in former ages ; also equisetace\u00e6, lilia, and conifer\u00e6. The vegetation was generally analogous to that of the Cape of Good Hope and Australia, which seems to argue a climate between the tropical and temperate. It was, however, sufficiently luxu riant, in some instances, to produce thin seams of coal, for there are such in the oolite formation of both Yorkshire and Sutherland. The sea, as for ages before, contained alg\u00e6, of which, how ever, only a few species have been preserved to our day. The lower marine animals present themselves in great abundance, and in some interesting varieties of form. Corals, absent in the lias, reappear in the oolite in quantity sufficient, at some places, as we have seen, to constitute entire"], [119, "105 REPTILES ABUNDANT. strata. The crinoids are also numerous, and amongst these are new genera showing an advance of organization from those of preceding systems. The pentacrinite, instead of a round, has a five-angled stalk, with an increased profu sion of tentacula ; it had also the superior cha racter of a power to float about, and attach itself where it pleased. To this fossil of the lias succeed others of the same family* in the oolite \u2014 comatula and ophiura \u2014 which are entirely free swimming, thus supporting the general appear ances of an advance of animal characters as we proceed from lower to higher formations. Here also appear other examples of the order to which the crinoidea belong (echinodermata) ; namelyr, the echinus, or sea-urchin, and the goniaster, which last is regarded as a link between the echinus and star-fish. Among the crustaceans of the oolite, a conspi cuous place is due to the limulus, or king-crab, of which several species occur in this formation. This animal is remarkable as the genus of our time to which the trilobite makes the nearest approach ; and the appearance of the limulus at the time when the trilobite vanishes, (the carbo nigenous era,) is spoken of by a distinguished F 3"], [120, "106 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. geologist as \"one of those beautiful links in natural history, of which the strata forming the earth's crust have afforded so many proofs.\"(37) Here also we have, in the eryon, an early example of the highest crustacean order, (decapoda,) and one to which the modern lobster and cray-fisb belong. Insects resembling the dragon-fly have been found in the oolite. The deeper oolitic seas were occupied by* vari ous species of terebratula, a brachiopodous mol lusk remarkable as having lived in one form or another from the earliest to the present time. In the shallower seas were other bivalves. There was also abundance of all the univalve classes, Pteropoda, Gasteropoda, and Cephalopoda. Of the last we see an advance of characters in the ammonites and belemnites, which now appear in many varieties. The Belemnite, which belonged to the higher order of the class, those having only two branchi\u00e6, calls for some particular notice. It is an elongated, conical shell, terminating in a point, and having, at the larger end, a cavity for the residence of the animal, with a series of air chambers below. The animal, placed in the upper cavity, could raise or depress itself in the water at pleasure by a pneumatic operation upon"], [121, "107 REPTILES ABUNDANT. the air tube pervading its shell. Its tentacula, sent abroad over the summit of the shell, searched the sea for prey. The creature had an ink bag with which it could muddle the water around it, to protect itself from more powerful animals, and, strange to say, this has been found so well pre served, that an artist has used it in one instance as a pigment, wherewith to delineate the belem nite itself. There are many fishes, some of which (acrodus, psammodus, &c.) are presumed, from remains of their palatal bones, to have been of the gigantic cartilaginous class (placoidean,) now represented by such as the cestraceon. It has been considered by Professor Owen as worthy of notice, that, the cestraceon being an inhabitant of the Australian seas, we have, in both the botany and ichthyology of this period, an analogy to that continent. The pycnodontes (thick toothed) and lepidoides (having thick scales) are other families described by M. Agassiz as extensively prevalent. In the English lias there is a vast abundance of the enaliosauria which we have seen commence in the foreign Muschelkalk, and, in addition to these, specimens of Pterosauria or Winged Sau rians, a type of being, the most new, perhaps, of"], [122, "108 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. all which the geological record has presented to us. The Pterodactyls, as the animals of this order have been called, were saurians of small 6ize compared with their associates, being not larger than a modern cormorant ; but the marvel in their case consists in bat-like wings extended upon the fore-finger, by which the animal was enabled to pursue its way in the air. This order became extinct in the time of the chalk formation. The only existing animal of which it may even remind us is the draco volans or flying lizard, which has a membrane by which to support itself in leaping from tree to tree. In the proper oolite, there is added an enalio saurian (the Pliosaur) in which there is a very close approach made to the crocodilian order, but upon a scale of enormous magnitude, the animal having apparently been as large as the existing whales. Here, too, we find the true cro codilia largely developed, and five genera have been described, ( Teleosaurus, Steneosaurus, Cetio saurus, &c.) The two first are like crocodiles of our own time in all respects, except a somewhat greater bulk, and certain peculiarities, indicating more aquatic habits. The last derives its name from the approximation to the whale tribes seen"], [123, "REPTILES ABUNDANT. 109 in the form of its vertebr\u00e6. In this group there is a genus presenting ball-and-socket vertebr\u00e6, and thus proving its advanced character; but, strange to say, the concavity is in this case di rected backwards, instead of forwards, which is the universal arrangement in similar cases, in our era. The first glimpse of the highest class of the vertebrate sub-kingdom \u2014 Mammalia \u2014 is obtained from the Stonesfield slate, where there have been found several specimens of the lower jaw-bone of a quadruped evidently insectivorous, and inferred, from peculiarities of structure, to have belonged to the marsupial family, (pouched animals.) (3S) It may be observed, although no specimens of so high a class of animals as mammalia are found earlier, such may nevertheless have existed : the defect may be in our not having found them ; but, other things considered, the probability is that heretofore there were no mammifers. It is an interesting circumstance that the first mammifers found should have belonged to the marsupialia, when the place of that order in the scale of creation is considered. In the imperfect structure of their brain, deficient in the organs connecting the two hemispheres \u2014 and in the mode of gestation, which"], [124, "110 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. is only in small part uterine \u2014 this family is usually regarded as only a little advanced above the cha racter of the bird. The highest part of the oolitic formation pre sents some phenomena of an unusual and inte resting character, which demand special notice. Immediately above the upper oolitic group in Buckinghamshire, in the vicinity of Weymouth, and other situations, there is a thin stratum, usually called by workmen the dirt-bed, which appears, from incontestable evidence, to have been a soil formed, like soils of the present day, in the course of time, upon a surface which had previously been the bottom of the sea. The dirt bed contains exuvi\u00e6 of tropical trees, accumulated through time, as the forest shed its honours on the spot where it grew, and became itself decayed. Near Weymouth there is a piece of this stratum, in which stumps of trees remain rooted, mostly erect or slightly inclined, and from one to three feet high ; while trunks of the same forest, also silicified, lie embedded on the surface of the soil in which they grew. Above this bed lie those which have been called the Wealden, from their full development in the Weald of Sussex; and these as incontestably"], [125, "REPTILES ABUNDANT. 111 argue that the dry land forming the dirt-bed had next afterwards become the area of brackish estuaries or lakes partially connected with the sea; for the Wealden strata contain exuvi\u00e6 of fresh-water tribes, besides those of the great saurians and chelonia. The area of this estuary* comprehends the whole south-east province of England. A geologist thus confidently narrates the subsequent events : \" Much calcareous matter was first deposited [in this estuary], and in it were entombed myriads of shells, apparently analogous to those of the vivipara. Then came a thick envelope of sand, sometimes interstratified with mud ; and, finally, muddy matter prevailed. The solid surface beneath the waters would ap pear to have suffered a long-continued and gradual depression, which was as gradually filled, or nearly so, with transported matter ; in the end, however, after a depression of several hundred feet, the sea again entered upon the area, not suddenly or violently \u2014 for the Wealden rocks pass gradually into the superincumbent cretaceous series \u2014 but so quietly, that the mud containing the remains of terrestrial and fresh-water creatures was tran quilly* covered up by sands replete with marine exuvi\u00e6.\" (39) A subsequent depression of the same"], [126, "112 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. area, to the depth of at least three hundred fathoms, is believed to have taken place, to admit of the deposition of the cretaceous beds lying above. From the scattered way in which remains of the larger terrestrial animals occur in the Wealden, and the intermixture of pebbles of the special appearance of those worn in rivers, it is also in ferred that the estuary which once covered the south-east part of England was the mouth of a river of that far-descending class of which the Mississippi and Amazon are examples. What part of the earth's surface presented the dry land through which that ancl other similar rivers flowed, no one can tell. It has been surmised, that the particular one here spoken of may have flowed from a point not nearer than the site of the pre sent Newfoundland. Professor Phillips has sug gested, from the analogy' of the mineral composi tion, that anciently elevated coal strata may have composed the dry land from which the sandy matters of these strata were washed. Such a deposit as the Wealden almost necessarily im plies a local, not a general condition ; yet it has been thought that similar strata and remains exist in the Pays de Bray, near Beauvais. This leads"], [127, "REPTILES ABUNDANT. 113 to the supposition that there may have been, in that age, a series of river-receiving estuaries along the border of some such great ocean as the Atlantic, of which that of modern Sussex is only an example. The zoology of the Wealden is chiefly remark able for the additions which it makes to the list of reptfles presented in previous formations. Be sides some new crocodilia (Suchosaurus and Goniopholis), and several chelonia ( Tetrosternon, etc.), we have here the principal constituents of a group, which Professor Owen has described as a distinct order, under the name of Dinosauria, the remaining form being the Megalosaurus of the oolite. These were terrestrial crocodile-like ani mals, with some features of organization recalling the lacertilia, ancl also such a massive and stately form of the extremities, as to remind us of the large land pachyderms. The animal last named, from twenty-five to thirty feet long, with an enor mous muzzle furnished with strong teeth, must have been by far the most formidable land crea ture of its age. The very opposite habits of the Iguanodon, an equally huge herbivorous reptile, lead me to suspect an error in the classification : but \u2014 passing from this \u2014 its size and stately limbs"], [128, "114 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. are such as equally to excite our surprise. From the scapula or blade-bone of the remaining genus, the Hyl\u0153osaurus, the approximation of the whole of the dinosaurs to the mammalian type of struc ture has been inferred. The imagination eagerly aspires to picture the world of the Oolitic Era, when there were scarcely any living creatures of more exalted character than reptiles. There were then vast tracts of dry land, as now ; their surface bore a luxuriant vege tation of no mean kind. The meteoric agencies, the rise and fall of tides, were common phenomena of that time, as of the present. Day after day, through long drawn ages, the sun passed on his course. Night after night, the sparkling garni ture of the sky looked down on this green world. But a being of superhuman intelligence, coming to examine our globe, would have seen all this existing only for fishes and still humbler creatures in the sea, and for reptiles, insects, and perhaps a few birds, and still fewer opossums, upon land. He would have beheld the tyrant sauria pursuing their carnivorous instincts upon the wave, upon the shore, and even in the air ; huge turtles creeping along the muddy coasts ; still more huge megalosaurs traversing the plain ;"], [129, "REPTILES ABUNDANT. 115 frog-like animals of the bulk of modern boars, croaking in the marshes ; and with all this, the air filled with multitudes of insects. But no flocks would have met his eye upon the mountains, no herds quietly roaming in the valley's. He would encounter no tiger or elephant in the jungle. None of the smaller mammalian quadrupeds, as the dog, the genet, the hedgehog, the hare, the mole, would have presented themselves. And not only were no human beings to be seen, but our supernatural visitant would know that this scene must lie spread out in perfect capability for their reception, during whole millenniums, before such beings were to exist; the stream flowing and glittering in the sun, but not to cheer the eye of man ; the season passing, but not to yield its fruit to him ; the whole jocund earth spread out in unenjoyed beauty, as yet unwitting of the glory and the gloom which human impulses were to bring upon it. How strange to reflect on the contemplations of the supposed visitant. What a vast void ! What a stretch of time before there was to be even a commencement to its proper filling ! And yet the certainty that in good time, in the ripeness of the plans of the mighty Author, the higher animals were to come, and among the"], [130, "116 THE TRIAS AND OOLITE. last the Creature of Creatures \u2014 who, in his infinity of device, was to turn it all to his use \u2014 the his torical being of the world ! It has been supposed by some geologists, that there was a special adaptation of the earth at this time to its predominating tenants, as if it presented only low muddy coasts and marshes fit for the resi dence of reptiles. And it has been thought that this state of the earth is what led to the existence of so many reptiles. But all such speculations rest on insecure grounds. When we consider that the Age of Reptiles, as it has been called, is inter posed between an age of fishes and an age of mammals, reptiles being also intermediate to these in the animal scale, we cannot but sur mise that the fact depends on some organic law rather than upon one in physical geography. An observation of some importance to this question is made by Mr. Darwin in his Journal. Describing the Galapagos islands in the Pacific Ocean, where turtles and lizards replace the herbivorous mam malia, and are the predominating forms of life, he says \u2014 \" The geologist, on hearing this, will pro bably refer back his mind to the secondary epochs, when lizards, some herbivorous, some carnivorous, and of dimensions comparable only with our exist-"], [131, "REPTILES ABUNDANT. 117 ing whales, swarmed on the land and in the sea. It is, therefore, worthy of his observation, that this archipelago, instead of possessing a humid climate and rank vegetation, cannot be considered other wise than extremely arid, ancl, for an equatorial region, remarkably temperate.\""], [132, "118 CRETACEOUS ERA. The record of this period consists of a series of strata, in which chalk beds make a conspicuous appearance, and which is therefore called the Cre taceous System or formation. In England, a long stripe, extending from Yorkshire to Kent, pre sents the cretaceous beds upon the surface, gene rally lying conformably upon the oolite, and in many instances rising into bold escarpments to wards the west. The celebrated cliffs of Dover are of this formation. It extends into Northern France, and thence north-westward into Germany, whence it is traced into Scandinavia and Russia. The same system exists in North America, and probably in other parts of the earth not yet geo logically investigated. Being a marine deposit, it establishes that seas existed at the time of its"], [133, "CRETACEOUS ERA. 119 formation on the tracts occupied by it, while some of its organic remains prove that, in the neigh bourhood of those seas, there were tracts of dry land. The cretaceous formation in England presents beds chiefly sandy in the lowest part, chiefly clayey in the middle, and chiefly of chalk in the upper part, the chalk beds being never absent, which some of the lower are in several places. In the vale of the Mississippi, again, the true chalk is wholly, or all but wholly absent. In the south of England, the lower beds are (reckoning from the lowest upwards), 1. Shanhland ox greensand, \" a triple alternation of sands and sandstones with clay ;\" 2. Gait, \" a stiff blue or black clay, abounding in shells, which frequently possess a pearly lustre ;\" 3. Hard chalk ; 4. Chalk with flints ; these two last being generally white, but in some districts red, and in others yellow. The whole are, in England, about 1200 feet thick, showing the considerable depths of the ocean in which the deposits were made. Chalk is a carbonate of lime, and the manner of its production in such vast quantities was long a subject of speculation among geologists. Some light seemed to be thrown upon the subject a few"], [134, "120 CRETACEOUS ERA. years ago, when it was observed, that the detritus of coral reefs in the present tropical seas gave a powder, undistinguishable, when dried, from ordi nary chalk. It then appeared likely that the chalk beds were the detritus of the corals which lived in the oceans of that era. Mr. Darwin, who made some curious inquiries on this point, further suggested, that the matter might have interme diately passed through the bodies of worms and fish, such as feed on the corals of the present day, and in whose stomachs he has found impure chalk. This, however, cannot be a full explana tion of the production of chalk, if we admit some more recent discoveries of Professor Ehrenberg. That master of microscopic investigation an nounces, that chalk is composed partly of \" inor ganic particles of irregular elliptical structure and granular slaty disposition,\" and partly of shells of inconceivable minuteness, \" varying from the one-twelfth to the two hundred and eighty-eighth part of a line\" \u2014 a cubic inch of the substance containing above ten millions of them ! The chalk of the north of Europe contains, he says, a large proportion of the inorganic matter ; that of the south, a larger proportion ofthe organic mat ter, being in some instances almost entirely com-"], [135, "121 CRETACEOUS ERA. posed of it. He has been able to classify many of these creatures, some of them being allied to the nautili, nummuli, cyprides, &c. The shells of some are calcareous, of others, siliceous. M. Ehrenberg has likewise detected microscopic sea plants in the chalk. The distinctive feature of the uppermost chalk beds in England is the presence of flint nodules. These are generally7 disposed in layers parallel to each other. It was readily presumed by geolo gists that these masses were formed by a chemi cal aggregation of particles of silica, originally held in solution in the mass of the chalk. But whence the silica in a substance so different from it ? Ehrenberg suggests that it is composed of the siliceous coverings of a portion of the microscopic creatures, whose shells he has in other instances detected in their original condition. It is re markable that the chalk with flint abounds in the north of Europe ; that without flints in the south ; while in the northern chalk siliceous animalcules are wanting, and in the southern present in great quantities. The conclusion seems natural, that in the one case the siliceous exuvi\u00e6 have been left in their original form : in the other, dissolved che mically, and aggregated on the common principle G"], [136, "122 CRETACEOUS ERA. of chemical affinity into nodules of flint, probably concentrating, in every instance, upon a piece of decaying organic matter, as has been the case with the nodules of ironstone in the earlier rocks, and the spherules of thc oolite. What is more remarkable, M. Ehrenberg bas ascertained that at least fifty-seven species of the microscopic animals of the chalk, being infusoria and calcareous-shelled polythalamia, are still found living in various parts of the earth. These species are the most abundant in the rock. Singly they are the most unimportant of all animals, but in the mass, forming as they do such enormous strata over a large part of the earth's surface, they have an importance greatly exceeding that of the largest and noblest of the beasts of the field. Moreover, these species have a peculiar interest, as the only specific types of that early age which have survived to the present day. While the specific features of all higher animals have been again and again changed since that period, these humble creatures have preserved the characters they then possessed \u2014 shall we say, through a continuing uniformity in the conditions under which they have lived, while all other animals have been exposed to circumstances productive of change ?"], [137, "CRETACEOUS ERA. 123 All the ordinary and more observable orders of the inhabitants of the sea, except the cetacea, have been found in the cretaceous formation \u2014 zoophytes, radiaria, mollusks, Crustacea (in great variety of species), and fishes in smaller variety. Down to this period, the placoid and ganoid fishes had, as far as we have evidence, flourished alone ; now they decline, ancl we begin to find in their place fishes of two orders of superior organi zation, those which predominate in the present creation. These are osseous in internal structure, with corneous scales. The enaliosaurians disap pear in this formation, while the land reptiles, so numerous in the two preceding periods, become much diminished in numbers. Of the latter, one ofthe most remarkable was the Mosasaurus, which seems to have held an intermediate place between the monitor and iguana, and to have been about twenty-five feet long, with a tail calculated to assist it powerfully in swimming. Fuci abounded in the cretaceous seas, and con ferv\u00e6 are found enclosed in flints. Of terrestrial vegetation, as of terrestrial animals, the specimens in the European area are comparatively rare, rendering it probable that there was little dry land near. The remains are chiefly of ferns, G 2"], [138, "124 CRETACEOUS ERA. conifers, and cycade\u00e6, but in the two former cases we have only cones and leaves. There have been discovered many* pieces of wood con taining holes drilled by the teredo, and thus show ing that they had been long drifted about in the ocean before being entombed at the bottom. The series in America corresponding to this, entitled the Ferruginous Sand formation, presents fossils generally identical with those of Europe, not excepting the fragments of drilled wood : showing that, in this, as in earlier ages, there was a parity of conditions for animal life over a vast tract of the earth's surface. To European rep tiles, the American formation adds a gigantic one, styled the Saurodon, from the lizard-like charac ter of its teeth. We have seen that footsteps of birds have been announced from America, in the new red sand stone. Some similar isolated phenomena occur in the subsequent formations. In the slate of Glaris, in Switzerland, corresponding to the Eng lish gait, in the chalk formation, the remains of a bird have been found. From a chalk bed, near Maidstone, have likewise been extracted some remains of a bird, supposed to have been of the long-winged swimmer family, and equal in size to the albatross."], [139, "125 ERA OF THE TERTIARY FORMATION- MAMMALIA ABUNDANT. The chalk-beds are the highest which extend over a considerable space ; but in hollows of these beds, comparatively limited in extent, there have been formed series of strata \u2014 clays, lime- stones, marls, alternating \u2014 to which the name of the Tertiary Formation has been applied. London and Paris alike rest on basins of this formation, and another such basin extends from near Win- chester, under Southampton, and re-appears in the Isle of Wight. A stripe of it extends along the east coast of North America, from Massachu- sets to Florida. It is also found in Sicily and Italy, insensibly blended with formations still in progress. Though comparatively a local forma-"], [140, "126 ERA OF THE TERTIARY FORMATION. tion, it is not of the less importance as a record of the condition of the earth during a certain period. The hollows filled by the tertiary formation must be considered as the beds of estuaries and gulfs, left at the conclusion of the cretaceous period. We have seen that an estuary, either by the drifting up of its mouth, or a change of level in that quarter, may be supposed to have become an inland sheet of water, and that, by another change of the reverse kind, it may be supposed to have become an estuary again. Such changes the Paris basin appears to have undergone oftener than once, for, first, we have there a fresh-water formation of clay and limestone beds ; then, a marine - limestone formation ; next, a second fresh-water formation, in which the material of the celebrated plaster of Paris (gypsum) is in cluded ; then a second marine formation of sandy* and limy beds ; ancl finally, a third series of fresh water strata. Such alternations occur in other examples of the tertiary formation likewise. The end of the Secondary Formation, which we have just seen take place, presents in some respects a remarkable resemblance to the close of what is called the Pal\u00e6ozoic period in the Permian strata. Looking broadly at the specific"], [141, "127 MAMMALIA ABUNDANT. forms of the next higher strata, they appear to have undergone a total change. Again do we now witness a difference of the shelly cephalo- poda. There is also a gradual reduction and finally a disapj:>earance of the specific forms of gasteropods, formerly abundant. It has hereto- fore been a belief of geologists, that at this point, as at the former, there was an entire renewal of life upon our planet ; but several considerations forbid such a conclusion in the second as well as in the first instance. First, the specific forms are not wholly changed, for a few do pass into the next higher strata. Second, there is, in the higher formation, an apparent following of an order applicable to the whole pal\u0153ontological history, as something under one law, seeing that birds and mammalia, the next classes in the vertebrate scale, are then added. In the words of Sir R. Murchison, who believes that a true geological passage may be found between the two forma- tions, the upper secondary rocks \u2014 judging from many of their generic forms \u2014 \" seem to have pre- pared the way for the sequence of the tertiary strata.\" For these reasons, the idea of an entire renovation of life at this time \u2014 what is commonly called a new creation \u2014 is not now maintained"], [142, "128 ERA OF THE TERTIARY FORMATION. anywhere with confidence. The more rational explanation of the appearances is one suggested by actual facts observed in the strata; that the final cretaceous beds were deposited in seas more than usually deep, and which were therefore no proper habitat for the animals previously exist ing ; that an interval of time afterwards took place, which is not represented by any strata which have been discovered ; and that, by the time the tertiary formation commenced, the usual modifying influences having never ceased, the fauna had undergone such an amount of change as naturalists are accustomed to describe (their language being wholly arbitrary) as a renewal of species. It is in perfect harmony with this view, that from the commencement of the Tertiaries, and as we ascend in the series, we find more and more specific forms identical with those still existing upon earth, as if we had now reached the dawn of the present state of the zoology of our planet. By the study of the shells alone, Mr. LyeU has formed a division of the whole term into four sub periods, to which he has given names with refer ence to the proportions which they respectively present of surviving species \u2014 first, eocene ;"], [143, "MAMMALIA ABUNDANT. 129 second, miocene ; third, older pliocene ; fourth, newer pliocene. (i0) This division, however, is to be regarded as not safely applicable to the Ter tiaries generally, except as a convenient means of indicating various portions of the series. The eocene period presents, in three conti nental groups, 1238 species of shells, of which forty-two, or 3*5 per cent., yet flourish unchanged. Some of these are remarkable enough ; but they all sink into insignificance beside the mammalian remains, which the lower eocene deposits of the Paris basin present to us, showing that the land had now become the theatre of an extensive creation of tbe highest class of animals. Cuvier ascertained about fifty species of these, all of them long since extinct. About four-fifths are of the order Pachydermata, thick-skinned animals, to which our modern elephant, rhinoceros, horse, and pig, belong. Nearly the whole of these, how ever, belong to a family which is now confined to South America and Sumatra, namely, the tapirs, \u2014 an animal of squat figure, and possessing a short proboscis, an inhabitant of the woods, and a herbivore, but of unsocial habits. It is curious to find that a family now so limited in its range, had formerly been distributed over France, Eng- g 3"], [144, "130 ERA OF THE TERTIARY FORMATION. land, and other parts of the earth. Naturalists have conferred the names, Pal\u00e6otherium, Lophi odon, Coryphodon, &e, upon the ancient extinct tapirs, which seem chiefly to differ from modern species in a few peculiarities of the constitution of the teeth, and in having three, instead of four toes upon the fore feet. One British specimen seems to have been about a third larger than the modern animal. Another section of the Paris eocene remains have served to reconstruct a family to which the general name Anoplotherium has been given, from a regard to its deficiency of all offensive or defensive weapons. These are the first ex amples of bi-hooved animals as yet discovered upon earth ; they were strictly herbivorous, and make a slight approach to the cervine or deer tribes. The common anoplothere was about the size of an ass, but less elevated from the ground, ancl with a tail of above three feet in length ; it is supposed to have been of aquatic habits, and an expert swimmer and diver, but also given to browsing upon land. Associated with these we find the first example (ch\u0153ropotamus) of an animal approaching to the hog tribe, being nearest to the peccary of South America."], [145, "MAMMALIA ABUNDANT. 131 We learn from the remainder of the Paris fossils, and from others found in the eocene, that the earth now possessed fresh-water reptiles; serpents of the size of the boa ; natatorial, wad ing, and rapacious birds; rodents (dormouse and squirrel) ; species allied to the racoon, the genet, and fox ; also bats and monkeys. Lastly*, the oldest tertiaries of America present us with the Zeuglodon, a herbivorous whale resembling the dugong, having a stinted development of the ex tremities, but an enormous tail, and reaching altogether the length of a hundred feet. In the miocene sub-period, the shells give eighteen per cent, of existing species, showing a considerable advance from the preceding era with regard to the inhabitants of the sea. The advance in land animals is less marked, but yet consider able. The predominating forms are still pachy derms, and the tapiroid animals continue to be conspicuous. Here occur remains of the Dino therium, a creature said to exhibit an affinity to the cetacea in the form of its head, and to the tapir in the character of its teeth. It is most distinguished by its huge size, being not less than eighteen feet long ; it had a mole-like form of the shoulder-blade, conferring the power of"], [146, "132 ERA OF THE TERTIARY FORMATION. digging for food, and a couple of tusks turning down from the lower jaw, by which it could have attached itself, like the walrus, to a shore or bank, while its body floated in the water. Dr. Buck land considers this and some similar miocene animals, as adapted to a semi-aquatic life, in a region where lakes abounded. Besides the tapirs, we have in this era animals allied to the glutton, the bear, the dog, the horse, the hog, and lastly, several felin\u00e6 (creatures of which the lion is the type) ; all of which are new forms, as far as we know. There was also an abundance of marine mammalia, seals, dolphins, lamantins, walruses, and whales. The shells of the older pliocene give from thirty -five to fifty \u2014 those of the newer, from ninety to ninety-five per cent, of existing species. The pachydermata ofthe preceding era now disappear; but others enter upon the scene \u2014 elephantoid ani mals, the hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and horse. All of these bear a striking resemblance to pachy derms of the same families still existing. We have, in the mastodon ancl mammoth, which suc ceed each other in the strata, elephants variously distinguished from the present by peculiarities in their dentition, and hence considered as of dis-"], [147, "MAMMALIA ABUNDANT. 133 ferent species, though this is a purely arbitrary distinction. What is remarkable of these ancient animals is their having lived in countries so far beyond the present range of their family, namely, throughout the whole temperate region of Asia and Europe (England not being excepted), and even so far north as the seventieth degree of latitude. The mammoth also inhabited North America. Its chief external peculiarity was a pair of long curved tusks extending forwards and upwards from the upper jaw. The numerous remains of the animal in the most superficial strata, and the discovery (in 1801) ofa specimen with its flesh and hide entire in a mass of ice at the mouth of the Lena in Siberia, show that it must have lived down to comparatively modern times. The pliocene gives many other new families. From remains which have been found, however fragmentary in many cases, there cannot be a doubt that all the principal mammalian forms, except the highest and a few others, now- existed throughout the earth, ancl in species which only differed from those still living in slight peculiari ties, chiefly of dentition. Bears, badgers, hy\u00e6nas, and feline animals ; moles and other insectivores ;"], [148, "134 ERA OF THE TERTIARY FORMATION. otters and weasels ; the wolf and dog ; then roamed for prey as now ; besides an extinct felina, the machairodus, possessing teeth like curved saws. England had beavers and bears, little different from living species ; only, one of the former family was of huge bulk. We also had the hippopotamus and rhinoceros. Oxen, deer, camels, etc., inhabited the great zoological province with which we are connected ; and monkeys and apes passed far beyond the tro- pical regions to which they are now confined. In India, besides the pachyderms of the European eocene, there were ruminants in abundance (in- cluding an extraordinary one, of huge bulk, named the Sivatberium), carnivores, rodents, and insecti- vores. Here also were monkeys, of unusual bulk; but the most wonderful animal as yet discovered in this region was a tortoise, not distinguishable in any point of structure from a land species now living, but reaching the surprising length of eighteen feet. The discoveries among the ter tiaries of South America have been of a not less in teresting character, in as far as they equally show an approach to the existing zoological characters of that region. Dr. Lund, a Danish naturalist, pre sents us with a monkey, indicating the features of"], [149, "MAMMALIA ABUNDANT. 135 the platyrrhine or New World group; and the edentate order, which is still more peculiar to that region, is there preceded by examples of vast size. In the megatherium, megalonyx, sce lidotheriuin, and mylodon, we have a family of sloths, of elephantine magnitude, which lived by breaking down and eating trees. The toxodon surprises us not less, being an equally huge mem ber of the rodent order, \u2014 that order which now includes most ofthe smallest quadrupeds. (*') One remarkable circumstance connected with the tertiary formation remains to be noticed, \u2014 the prevalence of volcanic action at that era. In Auvergne, in Catalonia, near Venice, and in the vicinity of Rome and Naples, lavas exactly re sembling the produce of existing volcanoes are associated and intermixed with the lacustrine as well as marine tertiaries. The superficies of ter tiaries in England is disturbed by two great swells, forming what are called anticlinal axes, one of which divides the London from the Hampshire basin, while the other passes through the Isle of Wight, both throwing the strata down at a violent inclination towards the north, as if the subter ranean disturbing force had waved forward in that direction. The Pyrenees, too, and Alps, have"], [150, "136 ERA OF THE TERTIARY FORMATION. both undergone elevation since thc deposition of the tertiaries ; and in Sicily there are mountains which have risen three thousand sect since tbe deposition of some of the most recent of these rocks. The general effect of these operations was of course to extend the land surface, and to increase the variety of its features, thus improving the natural drainage, ancl generally adapting the earth for the reception of higher classes of animals."], [151, "137 ERA OF THE SUPERFICIAL FORMATIONS. EXISTING SPECIFIC FORMS ABUNDANT. We have now completed our survey of the series of stratified rocks, and traced in their fossils the progress of organic creation down to a time which seems not long antecedent to the appearance of man. There are, nevertheless, memorials of still another era or space of time which it is all but certain did also precede that event. The first that calls for notice is the phenomenon to which geologists have applied the term denuda tion. Great hitches and slips are detected in superficial strata, \u2014 such as, if left in their original state, must have caused considerable inequalities on the face of the country ; yet all is found as smooth \u2014 the joinings are all as much reduced to a common level \u2014 as if some gigantic artificial force had been used for the purpose. Again, a"], [152, "138 ERA OF THE SUPERFICIAL FORMATIONS. great valley has been scooped out in the midst of sedimentary strata, leaving the edges of these facing each other from the opposite sides, with perhaps here and there an isolated mass starting up to the height of the two sides, being composed of matter which has resisted the agency by which the adjoining matter was removed. Here, it is thought, we see incontestable traces of the opera tion of moving water. The second fact we are called to notice is, that over the rock formations of all eras, in various parts of the globe, but con fined, in general, to situations not very elevated, there is a layer of stiff clay, mostly of a blue colour, mingled with fragments of rock of all sizes, travel-worn, and otherwise, and to which geologists give the name of Diluvium, as being apparently the produce of some vast flood, or of the sea thrown into an unusual agitation. It seems to indicate that, at the time when it was laid down, much of the present dry land was under the ocean \u2014 a supposition which we shall see supported by other evidence. The included masses of rock have been carefully inspected in many places, and traced to particular parent beds at considerable distances. Connected with these phenomena are certain rock surfaces on the slopes"], [153, "139 EXISTING SPECIFIC FORMS ABUNDANT. of hills and elsewhere, which exhibit groovings and scratchings, such as we might suppose would be produced by a quantity of loose blocks hurried along over them by a flood. Another associated phenomenon is that called crag and tail, which exists in many places, \u2014 namely, a rocky moun tain, or lesser elevation, presenting on one side the naked rock in a more or less abrupt form, and on the other a gentle slope; the sites of Windsor, Edinburgh, and Stirling, with their re spective castles, are specimens of crag and tad. Finally, I may advert to certain long ridges of clay and gravel which arrest the attention of travellers on the surface of Sweden and Finland, and which are also found in the United States, w-here, indeed, the whole of these phenomena have been observed over a large surface, as well as in Europe. It is very remarkable that the direction from which the diluvial blocks have generally come, the lines of the grooved rock surfaces, the direction of the crag and tail emi nences, and that of the clay and gravel ridges \u2014 phenomena, be it observed, extending over the northern parts of both Europe and America \u2014 are all from the north and north-west towards the south east. We thus acquire the idea of a powerful"], [154, "140 ERA OF THE SUPERFICIAL FORMATIONS. current moving in a direction from north-west to south-east, carrying, besides mud, masses of rock which furrowed the solid surfaces as they passed along, abrading the north-west faces of many hills, but leaving the slopes in the opposite direction uninjured, and in some instances forming long ridges of detritus along the surface. These are curious considerations ; and it has become a ques tion of much interest, by what means, and under what circumstances, such a current was produced. But in the present state of our knowledge, all that can be legitimately inferred from the dilu vium is, that many portions of the northern nations of Europe and America were then under the sea, and that a strong current set over them. Connected with the Diluvium is the history of Ossiferous Caverns, of which specimens singly exist at Kirkdale in Yorkshire, Gailenreuth in Fran conia, and other places. They occur in the cal careous strata, as the great caverns generally do, but have in all instances been naturally closed up till the recent period of their discovery. The floors are covered with what appears to be a bed of the diluvial clay, over which rests a crust of stalagmite, the result of the droppings from the roof since the time when the clay bed was laid"], [155, "EXISTING SPECIFIC FORMS ABUNDANT. 141 down. In the instances above specified, and several others, there have been found, under the clay bed, asemblages of the bones of animals, of many various kinds. At Kirkdale, for example, the remains of twenty-four species were ascer tained \u2014 namely, pigeon, lark, raven, duck, and partridge ; mouse, water-rat, rabbit, hare, hipjio potamus, rhinoceros, elephant, weasel, fox, wolf, deer (three species), ox, horse, bear, tiger, hyena. From many of the bones of the gentler of these animals being found in a broken state, it is sup posed that the cave was a haunt of hyenas and other predaceous creatures, by which the smaller ones were here consumed. This must have been at a time antecedent to the floodings which pro duced the diluvium, since the bones are covered by a bed of that formation. It is impossible not to see here a very natural series of incidents. First, the cave is frequented by wild beasts, who make it a kind of charnel-house. Then, sub merged in the current which has been spoken of, it receives a clay flooring from the waters con taining that matter in suspension. Finally, raised from the water, but with no mouth to the open air, it remains unintruded on for a long series of ages, during which the clay flooring receives a"], [156, "142 ERA OF THE SUPERFICIAL FORMATIONS. new calcareous covering from the droppings of the roof. Our attention is next drawn to the erratic blocks or boulders, which in many parts of the earth are thicklyr strewn over the surface, par ticularly in the north of Europe. Some of these blocks are many tons in weight, yet are clearly ascertained to have belonged originally to situa tions at a great distance. Fragments, for example, of the granite of Shap Fell are found in every direction around to the distance of fifty mdes, one piece being placed high upon Criffel Mountain, on the opposite side of the Solway estuary; so also are fragments of the Alps found far up the slopes of the Jura. There are even blocks on the east coast of England, supposed to have tra velled from Norway. The only rational conjec ture which can be formed as to the transport of such masses from so great a distance, is one which presumes them to have been carried and dropped by icebergs, while seas existed upon the space between their original and final sites. Ice bergs do even now carry off such masses from the polar coasts, which, falling when the retaining ice melts, must take up situations at the bottom of"], [157, "EXISTING SPECIFIC FORMS ABUNDANT. 143 the sea, similar to those in which we find the erratic blocks of the present dry land. While the diluvium and erratic blocks clearly suppose a part at least of the present land to have at one time been sunk to a considerable depth in the sea, there is another set of appearances which as manifestly show the steps by which the land was made afterwards to re-emerge from that ele ment. These consist of terraces, which have been detected near, and at some distance inland from, the coast lines of Scandinavia, Britain, America, and other regions ; being evidently ancient beaches, or platforms, on which the margin of the sea at one time rested. They have been observed at different heights above the present sea-level, from twenty to twelve hundred feet ; and in many places they are seen rising above each other in succession, to the number of three, four, and even more. The smooth flatness of these terraces, with generally a slight inclination to wards the sea, the sandy composition of many of them, and, in some instances, the preservation of marine shells in the ground, identify them per fectly with existing sea-beaches, notwithstanding the cuts and scoopings which have at frequent intervals been effected in them by water-courses."], [158, "144 ERA OF THE SUPERFICIAL FORMATIONS. The irresistible inference from the phenomena is, that the highest was first the coast line ; then an elevation took place, and the second highest be came so, the first being now raised into the air and thrown inland. Then, upon another eleva tion, the sea began to form, at its new point of contact with the land, the third highest beach, and so on down to the platform nearest to the present sea-beach. Phenomena of this kind become com paratively familiar to us, when we hear of evi dence that the last sixty feet of the elevation of Sweden, and the last eighty-five of that of Chili, have taken place since man first dwelt in those countries ; nay, that the elevation of the former country goes on at this time at the rate of about forty-five inches in a century, and that a thousand miles of the Chilian coast rose four feet in one night, under the influence of a powerful earth quake, so lately as 1822. Subterranean forces, of the kind then exemplified in Chili, supply a ready explanation of the whole phenomena, though some other operating causes have been suggested. In an inquiry on this point, it becomes of consequence to learn some particu lars respecting the levels. Taking a particular beach, it is generally observed that the level con-"], [159, "EXISTING SPECIFIC FORMS ABUNDANT. 145 tinues the same along a considerable number of miles, and nothing like breaks or hitches has as yet been detected in any case. A second and a third beach are also observed to be exactly parallel to the first. These facts would seem to indicate quiet elevating movements, uniform over a large tract. It must, however, be remarked that the raised beaches at one part of a coast rarely coincide with those at another part forty or fifty mdes off. We might suppose this to in dicate a limit in that extent of the uniformity of the elevating cause ; but it would be rash to conclude positively that such is the case. In the present sea, as is well known, there are dif ferent levels at different places, owing to the operation of peculiar local causes, as currents, evaporation, and the influx of large rivers into narrow-mouthed estuaries. The differences of level in the ancient beaches might be occasioned by some such causes. But, whatever doubt may rest on this minor point, enough has been as certained to settle the main one, that we have in these platforms indubitable monuments of an elevation of the land from the sea, and the con cluding great event of the geological history. The idea of such a deep immersion of the H"], [160, "146 ERA OF THE SUPERFICIAL FORMATIONS. land unavoidably suggests some considerations as to the effect which it might have upon ter restrial animal life. Some, regarding it as a complete submersion, argue that terrestrial life woidd be, on such an occasion, extensively, if not universally, destroyed. Nor was the idea of its universal destruction the less plausible, when it was believed that the present land animals are an entirely new set of species, introduced since the conclusion of the Tertiary Formation. It must now be owned that there are insurmount able objections to such hypothesis. First, it is not true that the specific forms of the tertiary epoch have all of them disappeared. There are several \u2014 for example, a badger of the Miocene \u2014 which are not in the slightest degree distin guished from living species. Many reptiles, now living in India, have been proved to be coeval with the Himalayan Anoplothere, Mastodon, and Hippopotamus. Second, the specific distinctions alleged in a great number of cases between tertiary and existing animals are extremely slight, and such as we have no fixed principle by winch to be assured that they mark new species, in the sense of a new creation. Finally, the ter tiary animals of America indicate an approxi-"], [161, "EXISTING SPECIFIC FORMS ABUNDANT. 147 mation to the character of existing animals in that region, and tertiary animals of the other great continent equally approximate to those at present occupying it ; showing that the demar cations of the present great zoological provinces had been already^ marked out, and have never been obliterated. There is therefore enough to justify us in believing that no entire submer gence of the earth took place at the time ofthe DUuvium, though how nearly it might approach completeness we cannot say. There are some other superficial formations, of less consequence on the present occasion than the diluvium \u2014 namely, lacustrine deposits, or filled-up lakes ; alluvium, or the deposits of rivers beside their margins ; deltas, the deposits made by great ones at their efflux into the sea ; peat mosses ; and the vegetable soil. The animal re mains found in these generally testify to a zoology on the verge of that now prevailing, or melting into it, there being included many species which still exist. In a lacustrine deposit at Market- Weighton, in the Vale of York, there have been found bones of the elephant, rhinoceros, bison, wolf, horse, felis, deer, birds, all or nearly all pre senting peculiarities different from existing species, H 2"], [162, "148 ERA OF THE SUPERFICIAL FORMATIONS. associated with thirteen species of land and fresh water shells, \" exactly identical with ty*pes now living in the vicinity.\" In similar deposits in North America, are remains of the mammoth, mastodon, buffalo, and other animals of extinct and living types. In short, these superficial de posits show precisely such remains as might be expected from a time at which the present forms of the animal world had been generally assumed, but yet so far remote in chronology as to allow of the dropping of many species, through familiar causes \u2014 perhaps we should only say the oblitera tion of many peculiarities called specific \u2014 in the interval. Still, however, several of the most im portant living species have left no record of them selves in any formation beyond what are, compa ratively speaking, modern. Such are the sheep and goat, and such, above all, is our own species. We thus learn that, compared with many humbler animals, man is a being, as it were, of yesterday."], [163, "149 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING THE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. Thus concludes the wondrous section ofthe earth's history which is told by geology. It takes up our globe at the period when its original incandescent state had nearly ceased ; conducts it through what we have every reason to believe were vast spaces of time, in the course of which many superficial changes took place, and vegetable and animal life was gradually evolved ; and drops it just at the point when man was apparently about to enter on the scene. The compilation of such a his tory, from materials of so extraordinary a cha racter, and the powerful nature of the evidence which these materials afford, are calculated to"], [164, "150 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING excite our admiration, and tbe result must be allowed to exalt the dignity of science, as a pro duct of man's industry and his reason. It is now to be remarked, that the whole series of operations displayed in inorganic geology is concluded upon as having taken place under the agency of natural laws. Those movements of subterranean force which thrust up mountain ranges and upheaved continents, stand in inextri cable connexion, on the one hand, with the vol canoes which are yet belching forth lavas and shaking large tracts of ground, as, on the other, with the primitive incandescent state of the earth. Those forces which disintegrated the early rocks, and of the detritus formed new beds at the bot toms of seas, are still seen at work to the same effect in every part of the globe. To bring these truths the more clearly before us, it is possible to make a substance resembling basalt in a furnace ; limestone and sandstone have both been formed from suitable materials in appropriate receptacles ; the phenomena of cleavage have, with the aid of electricity, been similated on a small scale, and by the same agent crystals are formed. In short, the remark which was made regarding the indif ference of the cosmical laws to the scale on which"], [165, "THE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 151 they operated, is to be repeated regarding the geological. A common furnace will sometimes exemplify* the operation of laws which have been concerned in the production of a Giant's Cause way ; and in a sloping ploughed field after rain, we may often observe, at the lower end of a furrow, a handful of washed and neatly deposited mud or sand, capable of serving as an illustration of the way in which Nature has produced the deltas of the Nile and Ganges. In the ripple-mark on sandy beaches of the present day, we see Nature's exact repetition of the operations by which she impressed simdar features on the sandstones of the carbonigenous era. Even such marks as wind-slanted rain would in our day produce on tide-deserted sands, have been read upon, tablets of the ancient strata. It is the same Na ture working everywhere and in all time, causing the wind to blow and the rain to fall, and the tide to ebb and flow, inconceivable ages before the birth of our race, as now. So also we learn from the conifers of those old ages, that there were winter and summer upon earth, before any of us lived to liken the one to all that is genial in our own nature, or to say that the other breathed no airs so unkind as man's ingratitude. Let no one sup-"], [166, "152 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING pose there is any necessary disrespect for the Creator in thus tracing his laws in their minute and familiar operations. There is in reality no true great and small, grand ancl familiar, in na ture. Such only appear, when we thrust ourselves in as a point from which to start in judging. Let us pass, if possible, beyond immediate impres sions, and see all in relation to Cause, and we shall chastenedly admit that the whole is alike worshipful. We have, then, in this history, a planet formed, and a long and complicated series of superficial changes effected upon it, all through the efficacy of simply natural laws, which we can see at work at this day in numberless familiar ways. But mixed up with these geognostic changes, and apparently as a final object connected with the formation of the globe itself, there is another set of phenomena presented in the course of our his tory \u2014 the coming into existence, namely, of a long suite of living things, vegetable and animal, terminating in the families which we still see occupying the surface. The question arises \u2014 In what manner has this set of phenomena origi nated ? Can we touch at and rest for a moment on the possibdity of plants and animals having"], [167, "THE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 153 likewise been produced in the way of natural law ; thus assigning but one class of causes for everything revealed to our sensual observation ; or are we at once to reject this idea, and remain content, either to suppose that creative power here acted in a different way, or to believe unex aminingly that the inquiry is one beyond our powers ? Taking the last part of the question first, I would reply, that I am extremely loath to imagine that there is anything in nature which we should, for any reason, refrain from examining. If we can infer aught from the past history of science, it is, that the whole of nature is a legitimate field for the exercise of our intellectual faculties ; that there is a connexion between this knowledge and our well-being; and that if we can judge from things once despaired of by our inquiring reason, but now made clear and simple, there is none of Nature's mysteries which we may not hopefully attempt to penetrate. To remain idly content to presume a various class of immediate causes for organic nature, seems to me, on this ground, equally objectionable. Granting, then, that the inquiry should be entered upon, it may be right to insist, in the first H 3"], [168, "154 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING place, upon certain general considerations, which, supposing we enter upon it in a scientific spirit, appear to throw the balance of likelihood on tbe side of ordinary natural causes. The production of the organic world is, we see, mixed up with the production of the physical. It is mixed in the sense of actual connexion and dependence, and it is mixed in regard to time, for the one class of phenomena commenced whenever the other had arrived at a point which favoured or admitted of it ; life, as it were, pressed in when ever and wherever there were suitable conditions, and, once it had commenced, the two classes of phenomena went on, hand in hand, together. It is surely very unlikely, a priori, that in such a complex mass of phenomena there should have been two totally distinct modes of the exercise of the divine power. Were such the case, it would form a most extraordinary, and to philosophic con sideration ought to be a most startling exception, from what we otherwise observe of the character of the divine procedure in the universe. Further, let us consider the comparative character of the two classes of phenomena, for comparison may of course be legitimate where the natural system is not admitted. The absurdities into which we"], [169, "THE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 155 should thus be led must strike every reflecting mind. The Eternal Sovereign arranges a solar or an astral system, by dispositions imparted pri mordially to matter; he causes, by the same majestic means, vast oceans to form and conti nents to rise, and all the grand meteoric agencies to proceed in ceaseless alternation, so as to fit the earth for a residence of organic beings. But when, in the course of these operations, fuci and corals are to be for the first time placed in those oceans, a particular interference of the divine power is required : in the belief of the ignorant, the very hand of Deity is necessary ; in that of the sage \u2014 as sages are amongst us \u2014 only a \" crea tive fiat\" is demanded ; but, in either way, special attention to the object, such as a human being has to pay in the progress of his affairs, is presumed. And not only on this one occasion, but all along the stretch of geological time, this special atten tion is needed whenever a new family of organ isms is to be introduced : a new fiat for fishes, another for reptiles, a third for birds ; nay, taking up the present views of geologists as to species, such an event as the commencement of a certain cephalopod, one with a few new nodulosities and corrugations upon its shell, would, on this theory,"], [170, "156 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING require the particular care of that same Almighty who willed at once the whole means by which in finity was replenished with its worlds ! I have here contemplated the question as one remaining to be settled by science. We must not, however, overlook that the decision is exposed to great prejudice, in consequence of our minds being prepossessed by a more or less distinct con clusion in favour of organic creation by some kind of special exercise of divine power. This is the idea which first rose in the human family, being that which the unassisted mind is apt to form out of the appearances presented to it ; precisely as, with regard to the heavenly* motions, the geocen tric theory was that which the appearances first suggested, and therefore was first embraced by man. This idea of the organic creation has rested almost undisturbed to the present day, because, till a recent period, science came little near it, and means for testing its soundness scarcely existed. It is different now, when, be sides the cosmical arrangements being seen to have been brought about under natural law, the same influence is traced through the whole series of geognostic changes since the beginning of our planet's existence. But yet, this knowledge"], [171, "157 THE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. being recent, the ancient idea of the creation of organisms continues to have that hold upon our minds which early impressions and long-con tinued habits tend to give to even the most un philosophical convictions. It is necessary to keep this in view, if we would enter upon the inquiry in a philosophical spirit, and with the pure desire to arrive only at such a conclusion as the balance of evidence may justify. In intimate connexion with the ancient idea, is the supposition found resting in many minds, that to presume a creation of living beings by the in tervention of law, is equivalent to superseding the whole doctrine of the divine authorship of organic nature. Were this true, it would form a most important objection to the law theory; but I think it is not only not true, but the reverse of the truth. As formerly stated, the whole idea of law relates only to the mode in which the Deity is pleased to manifest his power in the natural world. It leaves the absolute fact of his author ship of and supremacy over nature, precisely* where it was ; and only tells us that, instead of dealing with the natural world as a human being traffics with his own affairs, adjusting each cir cumstance to a relation with other circumstances"], [172, "158 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING as they emerge, he has originally conceived, and since sustained arrangements fitted to serve in a general sufficiency for all contingencies ; himself, of course, necessarily living in all such arrange- ments, as the only means by which they could be, even for a moment, upheld. Were the question to be settled upon a consideration of the respective moral merits of the two theories, I woidd say that the latter is greatly the preferable, as it implies a far grander view of the divine power and dignity than the other. For one thing, it places the lead- ing divine attribute of foresight in a much more sublime position. \" If,\" says Dr. Buckland, con- templating the possible establishment of this doc- trine \u2014 \" if the properties adopted by the elements at the moment of their creation adapted them be forehand to the infinity of complicated useful purposes which they have already answered, and may have still further to answer, under many dispensations of the material world, such an aboriginal constitution, so far from superseding an intelligent agent, would only exalt our conceptions of the consummate skill and power that could compre hend such an infinity of future uses under future systems, in the original groundwork of his creation.\" It is also to be observed, though almost need-"], [173, "THE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 159 lessly, that any objection of this kind w*ould lie equally well against other doctrines which the enlightened part of mankind have long admitted. The whole purport of science is to ascertain law ; it has, in the course of time, transferred one set of phenomena after another out of the region of marvel into that of law, thus showing a true divine regulation in them. Suppose, then, that there be a balance of probability from actual evidence in favour of an organic creation by law, we should only, in so settling the matter, be con cluding upon one department of the great system of things, as we have been concluding upon others throughout all the ages of philosojffiy. To return to a consideration of the positive arguments for an organic creation by law, we have seen that this stands in harmony^ with our conclusions as to the cosmical arrangements, and also those regarding the geognostic changes. We are now to observe that it consorts equally well with what we know of the actual history of organic beings upon the earth. These came not at once, as they might have been expected to do if pro duced by some special act, or even some special interposition of wdl, on the part of the Deity*. They came in a long-extending succession, in"], [174, "160 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING the order, as we shall afterwards see more con vincingly, of progressive organization ; grade fol lowing grade, till, from a humble starting-point in both kingdoms, the highest forms were realized. Time, we see, was an element in the evolution of Being, as it is in the reproduction of an individual at the present day. At the beginning of geolo gical investigation, it was thought that some im mediate external conditions ruled the appearance of particular classes of animals at particular times : as that the absence of dry land was the cause of the late commencement of terrestrial animals ; that there being for a long time only reptilian land vertebrata was owing to an overcharge of the atmosphere with carbonic acid \u2014 the store from which came the chief material of the abundant vegetation of the carbonigenous age ; and so forth. But it is now seen that the progress of the animal world was, in its main features, independent of such circumstances. There was dry land un reckonable ages before there were any land ani mals. The sea abounded in invertebrate animals before there were any fish, though the conditions required for the existence of both are the same. The oolitic continents where only reptiles roamed could have equally supported mammalia, for which"], [175, "161 THE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. the atmosphere was then fully fitted, even upon the admission of the carbonic acid theory, as the coal w*as by that time formed; yet mammalia came not. It was also a dream at the dawn of true geology*, that fresh creations of animals were con nected with great physical revolutions of the sur face: as if, at particular times, all had perished in storms of volcanic violence, and been replaced with a wholly new fauna. But this idea is like wise passing away. It is now seen that changes in specific forms took place quietly in the course of time, while no volcanic disturbances are trace able. In short, it is always becoming more and more clear that organic progress \u2014 both the spe cific changes in classes formerly existing, and the accession of new and higher classes \u2014 depended, not by any means wholly or immediately upon external circumstances, but in great part upon time. All this looks very unlike either special working or special willing on the part of the Creator, but, on the contrary, very like the simply natural procedure of things in the world of our own day. There are some other facts in the history of fossils, which it is difficult to reconcile with the idea of special creative effort, but which perfectly"], [176, "162 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING harmonize with that of a creation through the medium or in the manner of law. It is admitted, for instance, that \" the differences which exist between extinct faunas and the animals now living are so much greater in proportion as these faunas are most ancient.\" Passing downward in the formations and backward in time, we first find species identical with the present; next, only genera; afterwards, only families or orders. These are the words of naturalists ; but the truth simply is, that in early formations, animals resembled the present in broad general characters ; afterwards, they resembled them in characters more particu lar; finally, they become identical. Always as we advance, the total mass of the animal creation puts on more and more of the appearances which it now bears. It may be asked if this does not seem to imply that the present system of things is essentially connected with the past ; in which case, if the present is a natural system, we have an additional proof that the past was a natural sy*stem also. So also it is admitted that, how ever nearly the specific forms may experience an entire change from one formation to another, there are always resemblances and approximations be tween each two which are adjacent to each other."], [177, "163 THE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. \" If,\" says M. Pictet, an opponent of the views here advocated, \" we compare two successive creations of one and the same epoch, such as the faunas of the five divisions of the cretaceous formation, we cannot fad to be struck with the intimate connexion they have with each other. The greater part of the genera are the same : a great part of the species are very closely allied and easdy confounded. [Referring to two of these sub-formations,] is it probable that the albian fauna had been completely annihilated, and then, by a new and independent creation, replaced by a fauna altogether new, and so similar to it? I am aware that these facts may be referred to the general plan of creation [that is, a supposed plan, according to which the divine power had ope rated in its special successive creative operations] ; but is the mind entirely satisfied with this ex planation ?\" I cannot but echo the last question. Can we be content to assume \u2014 for, after all, it is assumption \u2014 that a series of miraculous creations was invariably to be in the manner of a piecing on and blending from one to another, when we have the alternative of presuming (grant it were to be left to presumption alone) that these con nexions are only memorials of a natural law pre-"], [178, "164 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING siding over the development of the whole organic creation, and making it one and not many things ? I can only wonder that a man learned in the subject can see such a difficulty as he has here stated, and find it more easily passed over than the bare fact that certain mammalia have not changed for three thousand years, \u2014 for such is the only difficulty he states on the other side. It must further be recollected that we are not only to account for the origination of organic being upon this little planet, third of a series which is but one of hundreds of thousands of series, the whole of which again form but one portion of an apparently infinite globe-peopled space, where all seems analogous. We have to suppose, that every one of these numberless globes is either a theatre of organic being, or in the way of becoming so. This is a conclusion which every addition to our knowledge makes only the more irresistible. Is it conceivable, as a fitting mode of exercise for creative intelligence, that it should be constantly paying a special at tention to the creation of species, as they may be required in each situation throughout those worlds, at particular times ? Is such an idea accordant with our general conception of the dignity, not to"], [179, "165 THE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. speak of the power, of the Great Author ? Yet such is the notion which we must form, if we adhere to the doctrine of special exercise. Let us see, on the other hand, how the doctrine of a creation in the manner of law agrees with this expanded view of the organic world. Unprepared as most men may be for such an announcement, there can be no doubt that we are able, in this limited sphere, to form some satis factory conclusions as to the plants and animals of those other spheres which move at such im mense distances from us. Suppose that the first persons of an early nation who made a ship and ventured to sea in it, observed, as they sailed along, a set- of objects which they had never before seen \u2014 namely, a fleet of other ships \u2014 would they not have been justified in supposing that those ships were occupied, like their own, by human beings, possessing hands to row and steer, eyes to watch the signs of the weather, intelli gence to guide them from one place to another \u2014 in short, beings in all respects like themselves, or only showing such differences as they knew to be producible by difference of climate and habits of life ? Precisely in this manner we can speculate on the inhabitants of remote spheres. We see"], [180, "166 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING that matter has originally been diffused in one mass, of which the spheres are portions. Con sequently, inorganic matter must be presumed to be everywhere the same, although possibly with differences in the proportions of ingredients in different globes, and also some difference of con ditions. Out of a certain number of the elements of inorganic matter are composed organic bodies, both vegetable and animal : such must be the rule in Jupiter and in Sirius, as it is here. We, therefore, are all but certain that herbaceous and ligneous fibre, that flesh and blood, are the con stituents of the organic beings of all those spheres which are as yet seats of life. Gravitation we see to be an all-pervading principle : therefore there must be a relation between the spheres and their respective organic occupants, by virtue of which they are fixed, as far as necessary, on the sur face. Such a relation, of course, involves details as to the density and elasticity of structure, as well as size of the organic tenants, in proportion to the gravity of the respective planets \u2014 pecu liarities, however, which may quite well consist with the idea of a universality of certain types, such as we see exemplified upon earth. We come to comparatively matter of detail, when we"], [181, "THE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 167 advert to heat and light; yet it is important to consider that these are universal agents, and that, as they bear marked relations to organic life and structure on earth, they may be presumed to do so in other spheres also. The considerations as to light are particularly interesting, for, on our globe, the structure of one important organ, almost universally distributed in the animal kingdom, is in direct and precise relation to it. Where there is light there will be eyes, and these, in other spheres, will be the same in all respects as the eyes of tellurian animals, with only such differ ences as may be necessary to accord with minor peculiarities of condition and of situation. It is but a small stretch of the argument to suppose that, one conspicuous organ of a large portion of our animal kingdom being thus universal, a parity in all the other organs \u2014 species for species, class for class, kingdom for kingdom \u2014 is highly likely, and that thus the inhabitants of all the other globes of space bear not only a general, but a particular resemblance to those of our own. It must be obvious, that, if organic beings are thus universally distributed, the idea of their having all come into existence through the im mediate agency of laws everywhere applicable, is"], [182, "168 ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. strictly conformable to the principle laid down for our own limited sphere. As a set of laws produced all orbs, their motions and geognostic arrangements, so a set of laws overspread them all with life. The whole productive or creative arrangements thus appear in unity."], [183, "169 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING THE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. A general probabdity being thus shown in favour of organic creation as a natural event, it becomes necessary to inquire whether this idea be sup ported or contradicted by special facts connected with the constitution of organic bodies. Here the patrons of opposite views appear at first sight to have an advantage. \" Yes,\" they say, \" it may appear that the bodies of space have been formed and arranged in the manner of natural law; it maybe admitted that all the geognostic phenomena have had a similar his tory ; but when you come to treat of life and ot- i"], [184, "170 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS ON THE ganization, you find yourself in a totally different field. These are mysteries, in the consideration of which physical laws fail you, and you are forced to make reference to causes of a different order. Before the origin of life upon our planet could be supposed to have taken place as a simply natural phenomenon, it would be necessary to show that life can be produced at this moment out of inorganic elements. But this cannot be shown ; and we must therefore conclude that a special interference of deity was required at the commencement of every* species.\" It is nevertheless true, that much of this is mere assumption, contrary to the actual state, and much more contrary to the tendency, of science. First, with regard to the constituents of organic bodies, it is found that they are merely a selection of the simple substances which form the inorganic or non-vitalized world. Carbon, oxygen, hydro gen, and nitrogen, are the chief. The first com binations of these in animals are into what are called proximate principles, as albumen, fibrin, etc., out of which the animal body is composed. Now, so far from there being anything peculiar or mys terious in these combinations, it is acknowledged that they are simply chemical. \" It is now cer-"], [185, "ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 171 tain,\" says Dr. Daubeny, of Oxford, \"that the same simple laws of composition pervade the whole creation ; and that if the organic chemist only takes the requisite precautions to avoid re solving into their ultimate elements the proximate principles upon which he operates, the result of his analysis will show that they are combined precisely according to the same plan as the ele ments of mineral bodies are known to be.'^42) A particular fact is here worthy of attention : \" The conversion of fecula into sugar, as one of the ordinary processes of vegetable economy, is effected by the production of a secretion termed diastase, which occasions both the rupture of the starch vesicles, and the change of their con tained gum into sugar. This diastase may be separately obtained by the chemist, and it acts as effectually in his laboratory as in the vegetable organization. He can also imitate its effects by other chemical agents.\" (43) The same writer elsewhere adds, \" No reasonable ground has yet been adduced for supposing that, if he had the power of bringing together the elements of any* organic compound, in their requisite states and proportions, the result would be any other than that which is found in the living body. Every I 2"], [186, "172 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS ON THE fresh discovery,\" he says, \" is tending to break down the barrier between the two classes of or ganic and inorganic bodies, as far as regards their chemical combination.\" (\") It is much to know the elements of organic bodies, and that the first combinations of these are simply chemical. The powers by which these combinations take place are next to be inquired into. The predominant idea hitherto has been, that the vital affinities are of a totally distinct nature, depending upon a mystic something, to which the term vital principle was applied. But this idea is now on the decline. Admitting the vital affinities, as powers superseding and coun teracting ordinary chemical affinities, it is seen that the idea of a distinct inscrutable principle on which they depend, is \" both unsupported by evidence and useless in the explanation of facts.\" (\") It is becoming evident that living structures result from the action of a multitude of natural forces in combination \u2014 \"gravity, cohe sion, elasticity, the agency of the imponderables, and all other powers which operate both on masses and atoms.\" Professor Draper, of New York, in making this statement, says \u2014 \" It is as tonishing that in our days the ancient system"], [187, "ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 173 which excludes all connexion with natural philo sophy and chemistry, and depends on the ficti tious aid of a visionary force, should continue to exist ; a system which at the outset ought to have broken down by the most common considerations, such as those connected with the mechanical principles involved in the bony skeleton, the optical principles in the construction of the eye, or the hydraulic action of the valves of the heart.\" O So much for the combinations concerned in living bodies ; but how shall we hope to see their forms brought under any relation to physical laws ? On this point we have some illustrations in the phenomena attending the production of crystals, a class of bodies which has been said to stand between the inorganic and the organic. From the agency which has been employed by Mr. Crosse in making ciystals formerly supposed to be of Nature's production alone, it is now in contestable that crystallization is dependent on electric agency, the special forms being the result of the peculiar nature of the constituent substance and the conditions under which the imponderable is applied. Here are obviously natural means of producing forms almost as various as those of"], [188, "174 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS ON THE living beings, and equally determinate ancl regu lar. A certain community of cause in the two instances is indicated by the surprising resem blance which some examples of crystallization bear to vegetable forms. In some, the mimicry is beautiful and complete ; for example, in the well-known one called the Arbor Dian\u00e6. An amalgam of four parts of silver and two of mer cury being dissolved in nitric acid, and water equal to thirty weights ofthe metals being added, a small piece of soft amalgam of silver, suspended in the solution, quickly gathers to itself the par ticles of the silver of the amalgam, which form upon it a crystallization precisely resembling a shrub. Vegetable figures are also presented in some of the most ordinary* appearances of the electric fluid. In the marks caused by positive electricity, or which it leaves in its passage, we see the rami fications of a tree, as well as of its individual leaves ; those of the negative, recal the bulbous or the spreading root, according as they are clumped or divergent. These phenomena seem to indicate that the electric energies have had something to do in determining the forms of plants. That they are intimately connected with vegetable life is indubitable, for germination will"], [189, "ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 175 not proceed in water charged with negative elec tricity, while water charged positively greatly favours it ; and a garden sensibly increases in luxuriance when a number of conducting rods are made to terminate in branches over its beds. With regard to the resemblance of the ramifica tions of the branches and leaves of plants to the traces of the positive electricity, and that of the roots to the negative, it is a circumstance calling for especial remark, that the atmosphere, particu larly its lower strata, is generally charged posi tively, while the earth is always charged nega tively*. The correspondence here is curious. A plant thus appears as a thing formed on the basis of a natural electrical operation \u2014 the brush realized. We can thus suppose the various forms of plants as, immediately7, the result of a law in electricity, variously affecting them according to their organic character, or respective ger minal constituents. In the poplar, the brush is unusually vertical, and little divergent ; the re verse in the beech : in the palm, a pencil has proceeded straight up for a certain distance, radiates there, and turns outwards and down wards ; and so on. We can here see at least traces of secondary means by which the Almighty"], [190, "176 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS ON THE Deviser might establish all the vegetable forms with which the earth is overspread. (47) We turn to the minutiae of organic structure and embryology, as affording us some further dlustrations of an instructive kind. It is now ascertained by microscopic research, that the basis of all vegetable and animal substances consists of nucleated cells ; that is, cells having granides within them. Nutriment is converted into these before being assimilated by the system. The tissues are formed from them. The ovum destined to become a new creature, is originally only a cell with a contained granule. We see it acting this reproductive part in the simplest manner in the cryptogamic plants. \" The parent cell, arrived at maturity by the exercise of its organic functions, bursts, and liberates its con tained granules. These, at once thrown upon their own resources, and entirely dependent for their nutrition on the surrounding elements, de velop themselves into new cells, which repeat the life of their original. Amongst the higher tribes of the cryptogamia, the reproductive cell does not burst, but the first cells of the new structure are developed within it, and these gra dually extend, by a similar process of multipli-"], [191, "ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 177 cation, into that primary leaf-like expansion which is the first formed structure in all plants.\" (*8) Here the little cell becomes directly a plant, the full formed living being. It is also worthy of remark that, in the sponges, (an animal form,) a gemmule detached from the body of the parent, and trusting for sustentation only to the fluid into which it has been cast, becomes, without further process, the new crea- ture. Further, it has been recently discovered by means of the microscope, that there is, as far as can be judged, a perfect resemblance be- tween the ovum of the mammal tribes, during that early stage when it is passing through the ovi- duct, and the young of the infusory animalcules. One of the most remarkable of these, the volvox globator, can hardly- be distinguished from the germ which, after passing through a long f\u0153tal pro- gress, becomes a complete mammifer, an animal of the highest class. It has even been found that both are alike provided with those cilia, which, producing an appearance of revolving motion, is partly* the cause of the name given to this animal- cule. These resemblances are the more entitled to notice, that they were made by various ob- i 3"], [192, "178 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS ON THE servers, distant from each other at the time.(<9) It has likewise been noticed that the globules of the blood are reproduced by the expansion of contained granules ; they are, in short, distinct organisms multiplied by the same fissiparous genera tion. So that all animated nature may be said to be based on this mode of origin; the funda mental form of organic being is a cell, having new cells forming ivithin itself, by which it is in time discharged, and which are again followed by others and others, in endless succession. It is of course obvious that, if these cells could be pro duced by any process from inorganic elements, we should be entitled to say that the fact of a transit from the inorganic into the organic had been witnessed in that instance ; the possibility of the commencement of animated creation by the ordinary laws of nature might be considered as established. Now it was announced some years ago by Prevost and Dumas, that globules could be produced in albumen by electricity. If, therefore, these globules be identical with the cells which are now held to be reproductive, it might be said that the production of albumen by artificial means is the only step in the process wanting."], [193, "ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 179 This has not yet been effected ; but it is known to be only a chemical process, the mode of which may be any day discovered in the laboratory. (M) Admitting, however, all these views regarding life and organization, the advocates of interference have still to say that a transition from the inor ganic to the organic, such as we must suppose to have taken place in the early geological ages, is no ordinary cognizable fact of the present time upon earth : structure, form, life, are never seen to be imparted to the insensate elements ; the production of the humblest plant or animacule, otherwise than as a repetition of some parental form, is not one of the possibilities of science ; if, then, we trace back the generations of organisms to the Silurian or any earlier epoch, and acknow ledge the world of that time to have been one in which the present order of natural events was prevalent, we necessarily can see no natural origin for species, and a miraculous one must be admitted. Here we have undoubtedly the strongest of the arguments usually adduced against a natural origin of life. Yet it is one which may easily be replied to. In the first place, there is no reason to suppose that, although life had been imparted"], [194, "180 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS ON THE by natural means after the first cooling of thc stuface to a suitable temperature, it would have continued thereafter to be capable of being im parted in like manner. The great work of thc peopling of this globe with living species is mainly a fact accomplished; the highest known species came as a crowning effect thousands of years ago. The work being thus, to all appear ance, finished, we are not necessarily to expect that the origination of life and of species should be conspicuously exemplified in the present day. We are rather to expect that the vital phenomena presented to our eye should mainly, if not en tirely, be limited to a regular and unvarying suc cession of races by the ordinary means of gene ration. This, however, is no more an argument against a time when phenomena of the first kind prevailed, than it would be a proof against the fact of a mature man having once been a growing youth, that he is now seen growing no longer. We might consider the primitive production of species either as one phenomenon of the nature of the development of an individual embryo, ancl that phenomenon as past, just as the individual creation is perfected at birth, or as expressly and wholly a consequence of conditions, which being"], [195, "181 ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. temporary, the results were temporary also. From the occupation of all the great geographical provinces with a more or less full suite of the forms of life, a new development may have hardly any chance of being now drawn forth, and none of being advanced to any extent, even though the same life-creating laws be still in force. Or the operations of these laws might be observant of times, and those of rare occurrence, so that hun dreds of human generations may pass without an opportunity* of witnessing such effects. However it may actually have been, assuredly the most rigid disproof of primitive creation as a fact of our time could be no conclusive argument against a natural creation at a time when the earth w*as vacant of all organic tenantry, if for such a crea tion any* positive arguments can be adduced. Secondly, it is far from being certain that the primitive imparting of life and form to inorganic elements is not a fact of our times. Such a doc trine is not generally received in the scientific world; but the reasons for rejecting it may at least admit of criticism. The leading one is, that, in a great number of instances where the super ficial observers of former times assumed a non generative origin for life, (as in the celebrated"], [196, "182 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS ON THE case in Virgil's fourth Georgic,) either the direct contrary has been ascertained, or exhaustive ex- periments have left no alternative from the con- clusion that ordinary generation did take place, albeit in a manner which escapes observation. Finding that an erroneous assumption has been formed in many cases, modern inquirers have not hesitated to assume that there can be no case in which generation is not concerned ; which is cer- tainly far from being allowable. There are several persons eminent in science who profess at least to find great difficulties in accepting the doctrine of invariable generation. Dr. Allen Thomson, one of the professors in the Edinburgh University, has stated several considerations aris- ing from analogical reasoning, which appear to him to throw the balance of evidence in favour of the primitive production of infusoria, the vegeta- tion called mould, and the like. One seems to be of great force ; namely, that the animalcules, which are supposed (altogether hypothetically) to be produced by ova, are afterwards found increas ing their numbers, not by that mode at all, but by division of their bodies. If it be the nature of these creatures to propagate in this splitting or fissiparous manner, how could they be communi-"], [197, "ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 183 cated to a vegetable infusion ? (51) It has been shown by the opponents of this theory7, that when a vegetable infusion is debarred from the contact of the atmosphere, by being closely sealed up or covered with a layer of oil, or only receives oxygen which has passed through sulphuric acid, whereby all animal admixtures have been de stroyed, no animalcules are produced ; but can we be sure, in such circumstances, that we have not set aside some other simple condition requi site for a non-ex-ovo generation ? Who can tell what effect such exclusion of air or such mode of admitting oxygen may have upon the operation of the imponderables in the case ? To this I do not believe that any satisfactory answer could be given. Perhaps the fashionable doctrine is in nothing placed in greater difficulties than it is with regard to the entozoa, or creatures which live within the bodies of others. These animals do, and appa rently can, live nowhere else than in the interior of other living bodies, where they generally take up their abode in the viscera, but also sometimes in the chambers of the eye, the interior of the brain, the serous sacs, and other places having no commu nication from without. Some are viviparous, others"], [198, "184 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS ON THE oviparous. Of the latter it cannot reasonably be supposed that the ova ever pass through the me dium of the air, or through the blood-vessels, for they are too heavy for the one transit, and too large for the other. Of the former, it cannot be con ceived how they pass into young animals \u2014 cer tainly not by* communication from the parent, for it has often been found that entozoa do not appear in certain generations of a human family, and some of peculiar and noted character have only appeared at rare intervals, and in very ex traordinary circumstances. A candid view of the less popular doctrine, as to thc origin of this humble form of life, is taken by a distinguished living naturalist. \" To explain the beginning of these worms within the human body*, on the common doctrine that all created beings proceed from their likes, or a primordial egg, is so diffi cult, that the moderns have been driven to specu late, as our fathers did, on their spontaneous birth ; but they have received the hypothesis with some modification. Thus it is not from putre faction or from fermentation that the entozoa are born, for both of these processes are rather fatal to their existence, but from the aggregation and fit apposition of matter which is already organ-"], [199, "185 ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. ized, or has been thrown from organized surfaces. * Their origin in this manner is not more wonderful or more inexplicable than that of many of the inferior animals from sections of them selves. * * Particles of matter fitted by diges tion, and their transmission through a living body, for immediate assimilation with it, or flakes of lymph detached from surfaces already organized, seem neither to exceed nor fall below that sim plicity of structure which favours this wonderful development; and the supposition that, like morsels of a planaria, they* may also, when retained in contact with living parts, and in other favourable circumstances, continue to live and be gradually changed into creatures of analogous conformation, is surely not so absurd as to be brought into comparison with the Metamorphoses of Ovid. * * We think the hypothesis is also supported in some degree by the fact, that the origin of the entozoa is favoured by all causes which tend to disturb the equality between the secerning and absorbent systems.\" (52) Here par ticles of organized matter are suggested as the germinal original of distinct and fully organized animals, many of which have a highly developed reproductive system. How near such particles"], [200, "186 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS ON THE must be to the inorganic form of matter may be judged from what has been said within the last few pages. While these appear as good general arguments for primitive life-production as a common occur rence in nature, there is a series of facts which goes a far way to prove that such occurrences must have taken place in comparatively modern times. The pig, in its domestic state, is subject to tbe attacks of a hydatid, from which the wild animal is free ; hence the disease called measles in pork. The domestication of the pig is of course an event subsequent to the origin of man ; indeed, comparatively speaking, a recent event. Whence, then, the first progenitor of this hydatid ? So also there is a tinea which attacks dressed wool, but never touches it in its unwashed state. A particular insect disdains all food but choco late, ancl the larva of the oinopota cellaris lives nowhere but in wine and beer, all of these being articles manufactured by man. There is likewise a fish called the pymelodes cyclopum, which is only found in subterranean cavities connected with certain specimens of the volcanic formation in South America, dating from a time posterior to the arrangements of the earth for our species."], [201, "187 ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. Whence the first pymelodes cyclopum ? To have produced all these various animals, there must have been means in force at a time long subse quent to that at which the production of life by miracle is assumed to have taken place. And what is this but to connect the ancient events, assumed to have come by miracle, with the modern cases of doubted primitive generation ? Does it not tend to show that the ancient and modern events are of one character, both alike results of a silent immutable energy imparted to nature by her Divine Author, and in the working of which there is no regard to great or small ? Seeing such reasons for believing the general dictum of the philosophical world on primitive generation to be inconclusive, we may be pre pared to review without surprise or incredulity the well-known experiments of Mr. Crosse, which seemed to result in the production of a small species of insect in considerable numbers. This gentleman was pursuing some experiments in crystallization, causing a powerful voltaic battery to operate upon a saturated solution of silicate of potash, when the insects unexpectedly made their appearance. He afterwards tried nitrate of copper, which is a deadly poison, and from that"], [202, "188 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS ON THE fluid also did live insects emerge. Discouraged by the reception of his experiments, Mr. Crosse soon discontinued them ; but they were some years after pursued by Mr. Weekes, of Sandwich, with precisely the same results. This gentleman, besides trying the first of the above substances, employed ferro-cyanate of potassium, on account of its containing a larger proportion of carbon, the principal element of organic bodies ; and from this substance the insects were produced in increased numbers. A few weeks sufficed for this ex periment, with the powerful battery of Mr. Crosse : but the first attempts of Mr. Weekes required about eleven months, a ground of presumption in itself that the electricity was chiefly concerned in the phenomenon. The changes undergone hy the fluid operated upon, were in both cases remarkable, and nearly alike. In Mr. Weekes's apparatus, the silicate of potash became first turbid, then of a milky appearance ; round the negative wire ofthe battery, dipped into the fluid, there gathered a quantity of gelatinous matter. From this Mr. Weekes observed one of the insects in the very act of emerging, immediately after which it ascended to the surface of the fluid, and sought concealment in an obscure corner of the"], [203, "ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 189 apparatus. The insects produced by both ex perimentalists seem to have been the same, a species of acarus, minute and semi-transparent, and furnished with long bristles, which can only be seen by the aid of the microscope. It is worthy of remark, that some of these insects, soon after their existence had commenced, were found to be likely to extend their species. They7 were sometimes observed to go back to the fluid to feed, and occasionally they devoured each other. (M) The reception of novelties in science must ever be regulated very much by the amount of kindred or relative phenomena which the public mind already possesses and acknowledges, to which the new can be assimilated. A novelty, however true, if there be no received truths with which it can be shown in harmonious relation, has little chance of a favourable hearing. In fact, as has been often observed, there is a measure of incre dulity from our ignorance as well as from our knowledge, and if the most distinguished philo sopher three hundred years ago had ventured to develop any striking new fact which only could harmonize with the as yet unknown Copernican solar system, we cannot doubt that it would have"], [204, "190 PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS ON THE been universally scoffed at in the scientific world, such as it then was, or, at the best, interpreted in a thousand wrong ways in conformity with ideas already familiar. The experiments above de scribed, finding a public mind which had never discovered a fact or conceived an idea at all analogous, were of course ungraciously received. It was held to be impious even to surmise that animals could have been formed through any in strumentality of an apparatus devised by human skill. The more likely account of the phenomena was said to be, that the insects were only developed from ova, resting either in the fluid, or in the wooden frame on which the experiments took place. On these objections the following remarks may be made. The supposition of impiety arises from an entire misconception of what is implied by an aboriginal creation of insects. The experi mentalist could never be considered as the author of the existence of these creatures, except by the most unreasoning ignorance. The utmost that can be claimed for, or imputed to him is, that he arranged the natural conditions under which the true creative energy \u2014 that flowing from the pri mordial appointment of the Divine Author of all things \u2014 was pleased to w*ork in that instance."], [205, "ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. 191 On the hypothesis here brought forward, the acarus Crossii was a tyrpe of being ordained from the beginning, and destined to be realized under certain physical conditions. When a human hand brought these conditions into the proper arrangement, it did an act akin to hundreds of familiar ones which we execute every day, and which are followed by natural results ; but it did nothing more. The production of the insect, if it did take place as assumed, was as clearly an act of the Almighty himself, as if he had fashioned it with hands. For the presumption that an act of aboriginal creation did take place, there is this to be said, that, in Mr. Weekes's experiment, every care that ingenuity could devise was taken to exclude the possibility of a development of the insects from ova. The wood of the frame was baked in a powerful heat; a bell-shaped glass covered the apparatus, and from this the atmo sphere w*as excluded by the fumes constantly rising from the liquid, for the emission of which there was an aperture so arranged at the top of the glass, that only these fumes could pass. The water was distilled, and the substance of the sili cate had been subjected to white heat. Thus every source of fallacy seemed to be shut up. In"], [206, "192 ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES. such circumstances, a candid mind, which sees nothing either impious or unphilosophical in the idea of a new creation, will be disposed to think that there is less difficulty in believing in such a creation having actually taken place, than in be lieving that, in two instances, separated in place and time, exactly the same insects should have chanced to arise from concealed ova.(M)"], [207, "193 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. We have now seen arguments, of both a general and particular kind, for the simply natural origin of life upon our planet. But, whatever force may be allowed to these arguments, no attempt has as yet been made to show how, even if life originated in its first and humblest forms in this manner, it passed on, otherwise than by a series of inter ferences, through that double series of higher forms terminating in the dicotyledons and mam malia, which we have seen rising throughout the geological ages, and leaving the earth occupied by its present organisms. In now proposing to make such an attempt, I K"], [208, "194 hypothesis of the development of deem it necessary, for the sake of simplicity, to confine attention mainly to the animal kingdom, the vegetable department of nature, which starts from a common, or at least, contiguous basis, being sure to fall into any system which may be found applicable to the other. It has already been intimated that the succes sion of animals throughout the geological eras is generally conformable to the gradation of forms in the animal scale, taking these in broad masses, and allowing for such imperfections in the series as geology itself at once leads us to expect, and partly accounts for. We have seen that, over looking an era with doubtful vestiges of life, there was first one in which only sea plants and inver tebrate marine animals flourished ; afterwards one presenting the meaner (cartilaginous) fishes ; and that higher (osseous) fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals, came at long intervals throughout the subsequent ages. Even when we pass into details, we find the succession to be in so many instances conformable to the gradation of the special groups of animals, that no doubt can remain that such is the case in all. Thus, for example, there is, be tween the sdurians and the oolite, a clear advance from humble to more highly organized cephalo-"], [209, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 195 poda and echinodermata. In the same time, the trilobite is exchanged for the superior but con nected form, limulus, and the brachiopoda sink beneath the new and superior class of bivalves, the lamellibranchiata. We see, in an order of fishes of the carbonigenous era, an approximation to the reptile class. By-and-by, come ichthy osauri, half-fish half-crocodile ; afterwards, a suc cession of forms ending in true crocodiles. Some difficulties have, indeed, been brought forward ; but they are, on a just view of the sciences con cerned, of no real importance, and I only deem them worthy of notice in a subordinate place. (65) Leaving for a future section the particulars of the animal scale, which will there lend us further illustration, it may now be observed that, while the external features of the various creatures are so different, there has been traced, throughout large groups of them, a fundamental unity of organiza tion, as implying, with respect to these groups, that all were constructed upon one plan, though in a series of improvements and variations giving rise to the special forms, and bearing reference to the conditions in which each animal lives. Start ing from the primitive germ, which, as we have seen, is the representative of a particular order of k2"], [210, "196 hypothesis of the DEVELOPMENT of full-grown animals, we find all others to be merely advances from that type, with tbe extension of endowments and modification of forms which are required in each particular case ; each form, also, retaining a strong affinity to that which precedes it, and tending to impress its own features on that which succeeds. This principle is partly matter of familiar ob servation. It is obvious to all, that an ordinary mammalian quadruped has a strong analogy of form to the human being ; its head, its forelegs, its hinder extremities, have each their representa tive parts in our frame. But the ordinary observer is surprised to learn how much further the prin ciple is carried. For example, the hind leg of the horse looks very different from one of our limbs, in as far as it seems to have a knee presented backwards, and possesses no toes. In reality, the part of the horse corresponding to our knee is high up near the body of the animal, and the hock corresponds to our heel. It has toes, more over ; but they are sunk in the hollow of a hoof, which serves as a shield to that part. The horse, the dog, and many other quadrupeds, may be said to walk upon then* toes (hence called digitigrade) : others, as the bear and badger, present the whole"], [211, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 197 foot to the ground, as man does (hence called plantigrade). Thus, too, the wing of the bird contains bones representing those of our arm, though modified for so different a purpose. The paddles of the whale tribes and seals are other curious modifications of a member substantially the same. The bat, again, has the bones of its hand developed to an unusual extent, so as to become a frame for the membrane by which it flies : in the extinct pterodactyle, the same pur pose was chiefly7 served by a development of the forefinger alone. The fundamental resemblance which lurks below various appearances is often startling. Thus, the giraffe, with its long neck, has, in that part, no more bones than are to be found in the neck of the elephant or pig, which hardly seem to have any* neck at all. The cer vical vertebr\u00e6 are but seven in every one of the mammalian animals. Sometimes, an organ appears entirely wanting in one family, as feet in the ser pent tribes, a pelvic region in the whale, the wing in the bird called the apteryx; and yet it is not truly wanting. Usually, some rudiment of it appears, as if nature had been willing to give it, but had kept it back from a complete develop ment, as knowing it to be not needed in that"], [212, "198 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF instance. On this ground, the notion of a much ridiculed philosopher of the last century, respect ing a human tail, may be said to be not quite without foundation. Between the fifth and sixth week, a tail exists in the human embryo ; it then goes back; but still in the mature subject its ele ments are seen clumped up in the bone at the bottom of the spine, the os coccygis. Unity of organization becomes the more re markable when we observe that the corresponding organs of animals, while preserving a resem blance, are sometimes put to different uses. For example, the ribs become, in the serpent, organs of locomotion, ancl the snout is extended, in the elephant, into an instrument serving all the usual purposes of an arm and hand. It is equally remarkable, that there should be, in the original plan of the animal structure, a double set of organs, one or other of which is selected for development according to the needs of the particular animal. Thus there are in the plan both gills and lungs, two wholly distinct kinds of respiratory apparatus, the one being de signed for a watery and the other for an atmo spheric medium. The mammalia, as creatures destined to breathe the air, are furnished with lungs ; but, at an early stage of the f\u0153tal progress,"], [213, "199 THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. this is not the case. They have at that time a branchial apparatus. Afterwards, this goes back, and the lungs are developed from a different portion of the organism. Lungs, on the other hand, are possessed by certain fishes in a rudi mental form ; it is the well-known air-bladder of those fishes, which are understood to profit by it, as an additional means of floating. So, also, the baleen of the whale and the teeth of the land mammifer are different organs. The whale, in embryo, shows the rudiments of teeth ; but, not being wanted, they are not developed, and baleen is brought forward instead. But the most remarkable circumstance attend ing the law of unity of organization is, that an organ wdl sometimes be seen developed to a cer tain extent, but wholly without use. This organ wdl, perhaps, be seen serving a purpose in a par ticular family of animals ; but we advance into an adjoining or kindred family, and there find a rudiment of the same organ, wdiich, owing to the different conditions of this new set of creatures, is of no kind of service. Thus, some of the ser pent tribes possess rudimentary limbs. In other instances, a portion of organization necessary in one sex is also presented in the other, where it is not necessary. For example, the mamm\u00e6 of the"], [214, "200 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF human female, by whom these organs are obviously required, also exist in the male, who has no occa sion for them. It might be supposed that in this case there was a regard to uniformity7 for mere appearance' sake ; but that no such principle is concerned, appears from a much more remarkable instance connected with the marsupial animals. The female of that tribe has a process of bone advancing from the pubes for the support of her pouch, ancl this also appears in the male marsupial, which has no pouch, and requires none. The same law of unity presides over the vege table kingdom. Amongst phanerogamous plants, a certain number of organs are always present, either in a developed or rudimentary state ; and those which are rudimentary can be developed by cultivation. The flowers which bear stamens on one stalk and pistils on another, can be caused to produce both, or to become perfect flowers, by having a sufficiency of nourishment supplied to them. So, also, where a special function is re quired for particular circumstances, nature pro vides for it, not by a new organ, but by a modi fication of a common one. Thus, for instance, some plants destined to live in arid situations, require to have a store of water which they may"], [215, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 201 slowly absorb. The need is arranged for by a cup-like expansion round the stalk, in which water remains after a shower. Now the pitcher, as this is called, is not a new organ, but simply the metamorphosis of a leaf. It is thus proved, with regard to the constituent beings of large sections of the animal kingdom, that they are bound up in a fundamental unity, however various in degree of endowment and in the purposes which they serve in the world. They may be said to stand in a connexion ana logous to that in which the planets are placed by7 the third law7 of Kepler. And the inference with regard to tbeir origin is the same. Precisely as it is impossible to suppose a distinct exertion or fiat of Almighty Power for the formation of the Earth, wrought up as it is in a complex dynamical connexion, first with Venus on the one hand and Mars on the other, and secondly with all the other members of the sy7stem, so is it impossible to conceive the same power using particular means for the production of a particular animal species, an individualized fraction, as it now appears, in a vast system which would not be complete without it, and into whose adjacent parts it melts by the finest shadings. Supposing, for a moment, that k 3"], [216, "202 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF each species had been distinct in its origin, these shadings would have been unnecessary ; and there would at least have been a strong proba bility against a unity of organization being adopted as part of the plan. In that case, abor tive or rudimentary organs must have been con sidered as a kind of blemish \u2014 the thing of all others most irreconcilable with that idea of per fection which a general view of nature irresistibly attributes to its author. If, on the other hand, we admit that the animal kingdom took its rise in a general law, we see in the shadings and the organic unity something not only harmonious with, but essential to the system. Rudimentary organs, too, appear but as harmless peculiarities of development, and interesting evidences of the manner in which the Divine Author has been pleased to work. It must be easy to see how this class of facts bears on the great question. Organisms we know to have been produced, not at once, but in the course of a vast series of ages ; here we now see that they are not a group of individually entire things accidentally associated, but parts of great masses, nicely connected, and integral in their respective totalities. Time, and a succession of"], [217, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 203 forms in gradation and affinity, become elements in the idea of organic creation. It must be seen that the whole phenomena thus pass into strong analogy with those attending the produc tion of individual organisms. But it becomes something more than analogy when we have learned the facts attending the embryonic develop ment of animals. First surmised by the illustrious Harvey7, afterwards dlustrated by Hunter in his wondrous collection at the Royal College of Sur geons, finally advanced to mature conclusions by Tiedemann, St. Hilaire, and Serres, endnyonic development is now a science. Its primary posi tions are \u2014 1. that the embryos of all animals are not distinguishably different from each other ; and, 2. that those of all animals pass through a series of phases of development, each of which is the type or analogue of the permanent configura tion of tribes inferior to it in the scale. With regard to the latter proposition, it is to be re marked that, whde it is generally true of the whole forms of animal being, it is more particu larly true of departments of the organization, as the nutritive system, the vascular system, the nervous system, &c, each of which is destined for a pecu liar degree of development in different groups of"], [218, "204 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF animals, according to their needs. Speaking, however, roundly, it is undoubted, respecting nearly7 all animals, that they pass in embryo through phases resembling the general as well as the particular characters of others of lower grade. For example, the comatula, a free-swimming star fish, is, at one stage of its early progress, a cri noid \u2014 that is, a star-fish fixed upon a stalk at the bottom of the sea. It advances from the form of one of the lower to that of one of the higher echinodermata. The animals of its first form were, as we have seen, among the most abundant in the earliest fossiliferous rocks : they began to decline in the New Red Sandstone era, and they were succeeded in the Oolitic age by animals of the form of the mature comatula. Thus, too, the insect, standing near the head of the articulated animals, is, in thc larva state, an annelid or worm, the annelides being the lowest in the same class. The higher Crustacea, as the crab and lobster, at their escape from the ovum, resemble the perfect animal of the inferior order entomostraca, and pass through the forms of transition which cha racterize the intermediate tribes of Crustacea. The salmon, a highly organized fish, exhibits, in its early stages, as has been remarked, the gela-"], [219, "205 THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. tinous dorsal cord, the heterocercal tail, and in ferior position of the mouth, which mark the mature example of the cartilaginous fishes. The frog, again, for some time after its birth, is a fish with external gills, and other organs fitting it for an aquatic life, all of which are changed as it advances to maturity and becomes a land animal. The mammifer only passes through still more stages, according to its higher place in the scale. Nor is man himself exempt from this law. His first form is that which is permanent in the ani malcule. His organization gradually passes through conditions generally resembling a worm, a fish, a reptile, a bird, and the lower mammalia, before it attains its specific maturity. At one of the last stages of his f\u0153tal career, he exhibits an intermaxillary bone, which is characteristic of the perfect ape ; this is suppressed, and he may then be said to take leave of the simial type, and be come a true human creature. Even as we shall find, the varieties of his race are represented in the progressive development of an individual of the highest, before we see the adult Caucasian, the highest point yet attained in the animal scale. To come to particular points of the organiza-"], [220, "206 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF tion. The brain of man, which exceeds that of all other animals in complexity of organization and fulness of development, is, at one early period, only \" a simple fold of nervous matter, with difficulty distinguishable into three parts, while a little tail-like prolongation towards the higher parts, and which had been the first to appear, is the only7 representation of a spinal marrow. Now, in this state it perfectly resembles the brain of an adult fish, thus assuming in transitu the form that in the fish is permanent. In a short time, however, the structure is become more complex, the parts more distinct, and the spinal marrow better marked ; it is now the brain of a reptile. The change continues ; by a singular motion, certain parts (corpora quadrigemina) which had hitherto appeared on the upper surface, now pass towards the lower ; the former is their per manent situation in fishes and reptiles, the latter in birds and mammalia. This is another advance in the scale, but more remains yet to be done. The complication of the organ increases ; cavities termed ventricles are formed, which do not exist in fishes, reptiles, or birds ; curiously organized parts, such as the corpora striata, are added ; it is now the brain of the mammalia. Its last and"], [221, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 207 final change alone seems wanting, that which shall render it the brain of man.(m) And this change in time takes place. So also with the heart. This organ, in the mammalia, consists of four cavities, but in the reptiles of only* three, and in fishes of two only, while in the articulated animals it is merely a prolonged tube. Now in the mammal f\u0153tus, at a certain early stage, the organ has the form of a prolonged tube ; and a human being may be said to have then the heart of an insect. Subsequently, it is shortened and widened, and becomes divided by a contraction into two parts, a ventricle and an auricle ; it is now the heart of a fish. A sub division of the auricle afterwards makes a triple chambered form, as in the heart of the reptile tribes; lastly, the ventricle being also subdivided, it becomes a full mammal heart. We have now to remember that, corresponding generally* to these progressive forms in the de velopment of individuals, has been the succession of animal forms in the course of time. Our earth bore crinoidea before it bore the higher echino dermata. It presented crinoidea, annelides, and mollusca, before it bore fishes; and when fishes came, the first forms were those cartilaginous"], [222, "208 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF types which correspond with the early f\u0153tal con dition of higher orders. Afterwards there were reptiles, then mammifers, and finally7, as we know, came man. Was it, then, too much to say that, when we learned the facts of embryonic development, we should see something more than analogy between the progress of species upon the earth and the production of an individual organism ? The tendency of all the illustrations is un doubtedly to make us look to development as the principle which has been immediately and mainly concerned in the peopling of this globe, a process extending over a vast space of time, but which is nevertheless connected in character with the briefer process by which an individual being is evoked from a simple germ. What mystery is there here \u2014 and how shall I proceed to enunciate the conception whicb I have ventured to form of what may prove to be its proper solution ! It is an idea by no means calculated to impress by its greatness, or to puzzle by its profoundness. It is as much marked by simplicity as perhaps any other of those which have explained the great secrets of nature. But here, again, it may be said, lies one of its strongest claims to our faith."], [223, "209 THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. My proposition is that the several series of animated beings, from the simplest and oldest up to the highest and most recent, are the results, first, of an inherent impulse in the forms of life to advance, in definite times, by generation, through grades of organization terminating in the highest dicotyledons and vertebrata, these grades being few in number, and generally marked by intervals of organic character which we find to be a prac- tical difficulty in ascertaining affinities; second, of another inherent impulse connected with the vital forces, tending, in the course of generations, to modify organic structures in accordance with external circumstances, as food, the nature of the habitat, and the meteoric agencies, these being the \" adaptations\" of the natural theologian. We may contemplate these phenomena as ordained to take place in every situation, and at every time, where and when the requisite materials and conditions are presented \u2014 in other orbs as well as in this \u2014 in any geographical area of this globe which may7 at any* time arise \u2014 observing only the variations due to difference of materials and of conditions. The nucleated vesicle is the funda- mental form of all organization, the meeting-point between the inorganic and the organic \u2014 the end"], [224, "210 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF of the mineral and beginning of the vegetable and animal kingdoms, which thence start in different directions, but in a general parallelism and ana logy. This nucleated vesicle is itself a type of mature and independent being, as well as the starting point of the f\u0153tal progress of every higher individual in creation, both animal and vegetable. We have seen that it is a form of being which there is some reason to believe electric agency will produce \u2014 though not perhaps usher into full life \u2014 in albumen, one of those component materials of animal bodies, in whose combinations it is believed there is no chemical peculiarity forbidding their being any day realized in the laboratory. Remembering these things, it seems, after all, an obvious idea that a chemico electric operation, by which germinal vesicles were produced, was the first phenomenon in organic creation, and that the second was an advance of these through a succession of higher grades, and a variety of modifications, in accordance with laws of the same absolute nature as those by which the Almighty rules the physical department of nature. Leaving the first of these supposed processes to rest upon the arguments which have been"], [225, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 211 adduced with regard to a possible transition from the inorganic to the organic, as a natural fact, we have two things to be accounted for \u2014 first, grade; and second, external peculiarities. We have to con vince ourselves, both that a fish may advance to be a reptile, and a reptde to be a bird \u2014 being a distinct step onward in complexity of organiza tion \u2014 and that particular organs are capable of being modified, so as to suit external condi tions, \u2014 for example, the bdl of a bird to the pick ing up of food in shallow waters, or the throat of the f\u0153tal marsupial to the reception of the mother's milk without a danger of choking. WTith regard to grade, it may be admitted at once that, in Nature's government, there is no observ able appearance of such promotions. But it may be asked, if, supposing such events to be within the scope of nature, we are necessarily to expect to see them take place, or even to hear of them having been recorded. To settle this question, let us first inquire into the proportion of the number of these grades to the space of time believed to be represented in the fossiliferous series of rocks. Mr. Lyell tells us that the space between our sun and some of the remote star clusters, of which the distance to Sirius (not less"], [226, "212 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF than nineteen mdlions of millions of miles) is but a fraction, may no more than compare with thc space of time which has probably elapsed since the origin of the coralline limestone over whicii the Niagara is precipitated at the Falls. Now, the number of grades of what may be called the first degree (transitions from class to class) passed through by the vertebrata since their origin in the Devonian rocks is, at the utmost, three. Such a leap in organic progress has, therefore, only taken place once in many millions of millions of years. If such be the case, all chance of such grade transi tions being witnessed within the four thousand years of historical humanity vanishes. As to the possible occurrence of such unusual events in the midst of a series which appears fixed and regular, let us call forward an illustration from the Ninth Bridgewater Treatise of Mr. Babbage. The reader is requested to suppose himself seated before the calculating machine, and observing it. It is moved by a weight, and there is a wheel which revolves through a small angle round its axis, at short intervals, presenting to the eye successively, a series of numbers engraved on its divided circum ference. Let the figures thus seen be the series, 1, 2, 3,"], [227, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 213 4, 5, &e, of natural numbers, each of which ex ceeds its immediate antecedent by unity. \"Now, reader,\" says Mr. Babbage, \"let me ask you how long you will have counted before you are firmly convinced that the engine has been so adjusted, that it will continue, while its motion is maintained, to produce the same series of natural numbers ? Some minds are so consti tuted, that after passing the first hundred terms, they7 will be satisfied that they are acquainted with the law. After seeing five hundred terms few will doubt, and after the fifty thousandth term the propensity to believe that the succeeding term will be fifty7 thousand and one, will be almost irresistible. That term will be fifty thousand and one ; and the same regular succession will con tinue ; the five millionth and the fifty millionth term will still appear in their expected order, and one unbroken chain of natural numbers will pass before your eyes, from one up to one hundred million. \" True to the vast induction which has been made, the next succeeding term will be one hun dred million and one ; but the next number pre sented by the rim of the wheel, instead of being one hundred million and two, is one hundred"], [228, "214 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF million ten thousand and two. The whole series from the commencement being thus, \u2014 1 s a 1 5 99,999,999 100,000,000 regularly as far as 100,000,001 100,010,002 the law changes. 100,030,003 100,060,004 100,100,005 100,150,006 100,210,007 100,280,008 \" The law which seemed at first to govern this series failed at the hundred million and second term. This term is larger than we expected by"], [229, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 215 10,000. The next term is larger than was anti cipated by 30,000, and the excess of each term above what we had expected forms the following table : \u2014 10,000 30,000 60,000 100,000 150,000 being, in fact, the series of triangular numbers, (\") each multiplied by 10,000. \" If we now continue to observe the numbers presented by the wheel, we shall find, that for a hundred, or even for a thousand terms, they con tinue to follow the new law relating to the trian gular numbers ; but after watching them for 276 1 terms, we find that this law fails in the case of the 2762nd term. \" If we continue to observe, we shall discover another law then coming into action, which also is dependent, but in a different manner, on trian gular numbers. This will continue through about 1430 terms, when a new law is again introduced which extends over about 950 terms, and this, too,"], [230, "216 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF like all its predecessors, fails, and gives place to other laws, which appear at different intervals. \" Now it must be observed that the law that each number presented by the engine is greater by unity than the preceding number, which law the observer had deduced from an induction of a hundred million instances, was not the true law that regu lated its action, and that the occurrence of the number 100,010,002 at the 100,000,002nd tenn was as necessary a consequence of the original adjust ment, and might have been as fully foreknown at the commencement, as was the regular succession of any one of the intermediate numbers to its immediate ante cedent. The same remark applies to the next apparent deviation from the new law, which was founded on an induction of 2761 terms, and also to the succeeding law, with this limitation only \u2014 that whilst their consecutive introduction at various definite intervals, is a necessary consequence of the mechanical structure of the engine, our know ledge of analysis does not enable us to predict the periods themselves at which the more distant laws will be introduced.\" It is not difficult to apply the philosophy of this passage to the question under consideration. Let us remember that the gestation of a single"], [231, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 217 organism is the work of but a few clays, weeks, or months ; but the gestation (so to speak) of a whole creation is a matter involving the enormous spaces of time which have been described. Suppose that an ephemeron, hovering over a pool for its one April day of life, were capable of observing the fry of the frog in the water below. In its aged afternoon, having seen no change upon them for such a long time, it would be little qualified to conceive that the external branchi\u00e6 of these crea tures were to decay, and be replaced by internal lungs, that feet were to be developed, the tail erased, and the animal then to become a denizen of the land. Precisely such may be our difficulty in conceiving that plants and animals are capable of advancing by generation to a higher type of being. Granting that, during the whole time which we call the historical era, there have been no movements of this kind, nor even any of the less rare transitions in which only specific modi fications are concerned, we know the historical era to be only an infinitesimal portion of the entire age of our globe. We do not know what may have happened during the ages which preceded its commencement, as we do not know what may happen in ages yet in the distant future. All, L"], [232, "218 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF therefore, that we can properly infer from the ap parent fixity of organic forms is, that such is the ordinary procedure of nature in the time immedi ately passing before our eyes. Mr. Babbage's illustration enables us to understand how this ordinary procedure may be subordinate to a higher law which in proper season interrupts and changes it. It has been seen that, in the reproduction of the higher animals, the new being passes through stages in which it is successively fish-like and reptile-like. But the resemblance is not to the adult fish or the adult reptile, but to the fish and reptile at a certain point in their f\u0153tal progress ; this holds true with regard to the vascular, ner vous, and other systems alike. It seems as if gestation consisted of two distinct and inde pendent stages \u2014 one devoted to the development of the new being through the conditions of the inferior types, or, rather through the corresriond ing first stages of their development; another per fecting and bringing the new being to a healthy maturity, on the basis of the point of development reached. This may be illustrated by a simple diagram^58) The f\u0153tus of all the four classes may be supposed to advance in an identical con-"], [233, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS 219 dition to the point A. The fish there diverges and passes along a line apart, and peculiar to it self, to its mature state at F. The reptile, bird, and mammal, go on together to C, where the reptile diverges in like manner, and ad vances by itself to R. The bird diverges at D, and goes on to B. Here it is apparent that the only thing re quired for an advance from one grade to another in the generative process is that, for example, the fish embryo should not diverge at A, but go on to C before it diverges, in which case the progeny7 will be, not a fish, but a reptile. To protract the straights or iv ard part of the gestation over a small space is all that is necessary. Now we may never see an example of the working of the actual law which is supposed to be capable of producing such an advance of grade ; but something approaching to it in effect has been observed. Sex is fully ascertained to be a matter of development. All beings are, at one stage of the embryotic progress, female ; a certain number of them are afterwards advanced to be of the more powerful sex. From this it will L 2"], [234, "220 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF be understood that no absolute distinction exists ; all such are merely apparent. The ingenious Huber first made us aware of an instance, in a humble department of the animal world, of arrange- ments being made by the animals themselves for adjusting the law of development to thc production of a particular sex. Amongst bees, as amongst several other insect tribes, there is in each com- munity but one true female, the queen bee, the workers being false females or neuters ; that is to say, sex is carried on in them to a point inter- mediate between the female and male, where it is attended by sterility. The rireparatory states of the queen bee occupy sixteen days ; those of the neuters, twenty ; and those of males, twenty- four. Now it is a fact, settled by innumerable observations and experiments, that the bees can so modify a larva, which otherwise would result in a worker, that, when the perfect insect emerges from the pupa, it is found to be a queen or true female. For this purpose they enlarge its cell, make a pyramidal hollow to allow of its assuming a vertical instead of a horizontal position, keep it warmer than other larv\u00e6 are kept, and feed it with a peculiar kind of food. From these simple cir cumstances, leading to a shortening of the em-"], [235, "221 THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. bryotic condition, results a creature different in form, and also in dispositions, from what would have otherwise been produced. Some of the organs possessed by the worker are here wanting. We have a creature \" destined to enjoy love, to burn with jealousy and anger, to be incited to vengeance, and to pass her time without labour,\" instead of one \" zealous for the good of the com munity, a defender of the public rights, enjoying an immunity from the stimulus of sexual appetite and the pains of parturition; laborious, indus trious, patient, ingenious, skilful ; incessantly en gaged in the nurture of the young, in collecting honey and pollen, in elaborating wax, in con structing cells and the like ! \u2014 paying the most respectful and assiduous attention to objects wdiich, had its ovaries been developed, it would have hated and pursued with the most vindictive fury till it had destroyed them !\"(59) All these changes may be produced by a mere modification of the em bryotic progress, which it is within the power of the adult animals to effect. By the arrangements made and the food given, the embryo becomes sooner fit for being ushered forth in its imago or perfect state. Development may be said to be thus arrested at a particular stage \u2014 that early one"], [236, "222 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF at which the female sex is complete. In the other circumstances, it is allowed to go on four days longer, and a stage is then reached between the two sexes, which in this species is destined to be the perfect condition of a large portion of the community*. Four days more make it a perfect male. It may be observed that there is, from the period of oviposition, a destined distinction be tween the sexes of the young bees. Tbe queen lays the whole of the eggs which are designed to become workers, before she begins to lay those which become males. But the condition of her reproductive syrstem evidently governs the matter of sex, for it is remarked that when her impreg nation is delayed beyond the twenty7-eighth day of her entire existence, she lays only eggs which become males. We have here, it will be admitted, a most re markable illustration of the principle of develop ment, although in an operation limited to the production of sex only. Let it not be said that the phenomena concerned in the generation of bees may be very different from those concerned in the reproduction of the higher animals. There is a unity throughout nature which makes the one case an instructive reflection ofthe other. C50)"], [237, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 223 We shall now see an instance of development operating within the production of what approaches to the character of variety of species. It is fully established that a human family, tribe, or nation, is liable, in the course of generations, to be either advanced from a mean form to a higher one, or degraded from a higher to a lower, by the influence of the physical conditions in which it lives. The coarse features, and other structural peculiarities of the negro race only continue while these people live amidst the circumstances usually associated with barbarism. In a more temperate clime, and higher social state, the face and figure become greatly refined. The few African nations which possess any civilization exhibit forms approaching the European ; and when the same people in the United States of America have enjoyed a within door life for several generations, they assimilate to the whites amongst whom they live. On the other hand, there are authentic instances of a people originally well-formed and good-looking, being brought, by imperfect diet and a variety of physical hardships, to a meaner form. It is re markable that prominence of the jaws, a recession aud diminution of the cranium, and an elongation and attenuation of the limbs, are peculiarities"], [238, "224 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF always produced by these miserable conditions, for they indicate an unequivocal retrogression towards the type of the lower animals. Thus we see nature alike willing to go back and to go forward. Both effects are simply the result of the operation of the law of development in the generative system. Let us trace this law* also in the production of certain classes of monstrosities. A human f\u0153tus is often left with one of the most important parts of its frame imperfectly developed; the heart, for instance, goes no further than the three-chambered form, so that it is the heart of a reptile. There are even instances of this organ being left in the two-chambered or fish-form. Here we have appa rently a realization of the converse of advance of grade, so far, at least, as one organ is concerned. Seeing a complete specific retrogression in one point, how easy it is to suppose a simply natural process, reversing the phenomenon, and making a fish mother develop a reptile heart, or a reptile mother develop a mammal one. It is no great boldness to surmise that a super-adequacy of force in the measure of this under-adequacy (and the one thing seems as natural an occurrence as the other) would suffice in a natatorial bird to"], [239, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 225 give it as a progeny the omithorhynchus, or might give the progeny of an omithorhynchus the mouth and feet of a true mammalian, and thus complete at two stages a passage from one class to another. Perhaps, with the bulk of men, even those de voted to science, the great difficulty is, after all, in conceiving the particulars of such a process as would be required to advance a fish into a reptile. Ancl yet no difficulty could well be less substan tial, seeing that the metamorphosis of the tadpole into the frog \u2014 a phenomenon presented to our observation in countless instances every spring \u2014 is, in part at least, as thoroughly a transmutation of the fish organization into that of the reptile, as the supposable change of sauroid fishes into saurian reptiles could ever be. It is different, as being only a process in ordinary generation ; but it realizes, as far as the necessary organic changes are concerned, the hypothetic view of an advance of one grade of animal forms into another. There is another fact connected with the reproduction of the batrachian order of reptiles, that, when the young are enclosed in a dark box sunk in a river, with holes through which the water may flow, the animals grow, but never undergo their destined change : they become gigantic tadpoles, and the l 3"], [240, "226 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF reptile characters are not developed. Here the progeny of a reptile literally becomes a fish, and transition of species is thoroughly realized, although in retrogression. And this is an in stance in which the whole animal is concerned. Now surely no one will deny that that which we see nature undo she is able to do, and might be seen doing, if the proper occasion were to occur, or were the requisite attendant conditions realized. So much with regard to grade. Let us now consider the principle of modifiability \u2014 that part of the hypothesis to which we are to look for an account of the external variations and adaptations of animals. Here we are directly opposed by the prevalent doctrine among naturalists, that species is in transible, and has so continued during all the time that scientific observation has existed. There is a certain variability, they admit, in organisms, throughout successive generations, and for this variability external conditions may ac count ; but such variations show a disposition to give way, when the original conditions are re sumed, or when the changed individual is mingled in alliance with the original stock. There is therefore a fixed and immutable character which"], [241, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 227 we call species, and which can only be traced to an origin differing as an event from the procedure of nature in our own time. I trust to be able to show that this doctrine is in such a condition with regard to facts, and has of late been obliged by facts to make so many7 shifts in its assumptions, that it is not entitled to the respect usually assigned to it. The doctrine theoretically attaches the term species to every organism which manifests the same peculiarities throughout a series of genera tions. Practically7, without waiting to watch suc cessive generations, or where, from the extinction of the organism, this may be impossible, natural ists give the appellation to every organism which presents a plurality of individuals similarly marked. Very small peculiarities suffice. A par ticular spot on the wing of a butterfly constitutes it a distinct species. The Golden Plover of Australia was so reckoned, and got the name of Xanthocheilus, from only having a small portion of yellow in the commissure of its bill. At the same time, in pal\u00e6ontology, such a peculiarity as an extra-plication in the enamel of a fossil pachiderm's tooth, is sufficient to obtain a specific name for that animal, and constitute its origin a"], [242, "228 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF separate miracle. With equal facility, naturalists of this predominant order make up groups of species into genera, and groups of genera into families and tribes. Suppose the doctrine were to be taken accord ing to the practice, we should possess a fact speaking strongly against fixity of species. It has been pointed out by an eminent botanist that, amongst recent fossil plants, are poplars, pines, birches, and hornbeams, like those now existing, but not the same. Thus one species has replaced another in even comparatively recent times. It may7 be asked, if the same change of species has not been going on since. The vague descriptions of ancient botanists forbid our speaking confidently of the intermediate ages. But look to the present time. In districts ex amined narrowly* at no distant day7, new species are continually being found by new investigators. It wdl be said that these are owing to the acute ness of modern observers. But this is begging the whole question. \" We do not know,\" says our author, \"that we are entitled to assert, that botanists were so mole-eyed thirty years ago, that their quick-sighted successors have been able to add twenty-five per cent, to the number"], [243, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 229 of ascertained species growing at their own doors.\"(6') Grant, then, that the peculiar plants in question really are species, the probability undoubtedly is, that they are new species, true examples of that very phenomenon which the superstition of science would hold to be a super natural event. Stdl, take the doctrine according to the practice, and let us see how it stands with regard to certain facts recently ascertained. Amidst all the dog matism which has been indulged in on this sub ject, the assumed distinction of species has given way in numberless instances, both in the vege table and animal kingdoms. In botany, the wider distinction of genus, and even that of whole tribes, has proved in some cases fallacious. Ac cording to Dr. Lindley, \" So entirely in the simplest forms of Thallogens [an assemblage embracing sea-weeds, fungi, and lichens] is all trace of series missing, that in some of them their reproductive matter has been regarded by certain writers as altogether of an ambiguous nature. In their opinion, it is even uncertain whether this matter will reproduce its like, and whether it is not a mere representation of the vital principle of vegetation, capable of being"], [244, "230 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF called into action either as a Fungus, an Alga, or a Lichen, according to the particular conditions of heat, light, moisture, and medium, in whicii it is placed ; producing Fungi upon dead or putrid organic beings ; Lichens upon living vegetables, earth or stones ; and Alg\u00e6 where water is the medium in which they are developed. Kutzing endeavours to maintain the following propositions connected with this subject: \u2014 lst, the formation of organic matter can only take place by means of the previously dissolved elements of other organic principles ; 2nd, simple globules, such as Cryptococcus, Palmella, and Protococcus, can give birth to different formations, according to the influence of light, air, and temperature ; 3rd, we must regard all the forms of lower alg\u00e6 as vege tations of a very simple structure, and distinguish them from each other, notwithstanding that in certain circumstances they may raise themselves to vegetations of a higher form ; for, in other cir cumstances, they can exist and multiply inde pendently ; 4th, the same formation may be pro duced by primitive formations of altogether dif ferent kinds.\" \"It has been said,\" adds Dr. Lindley, \" that Alg\u00e6 are aquatics, while Lichens and Fungi are terrestrial ; but Fungi will develop"], [245, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 231 in water, when they assume the form of Alg\u0153.\"(62) Undoubtedly, eight so called genera of fungi are now set down as only variations of one plant (Telephora sulphurea), arising from peculiar con ditions of culture. Even in higher departments of the vegetable kingdom, the revolutions have been very remark able. Six so-called species of pine are wound up into one in a recent inemoir on the Conifer\u00e6. The cowslip, primrose, oxlip, and polyanthus, which were always regarded as distinct species, are now found to be producible from one set of seeds, under various conditions ; they are radi cally one plant. So also \"the clove, pink, and carnation are only varieties of a flower growing among the ruins of some of our old castles, the Dianthus caryophyllus.\" The artichoke of the garden and the cardoon (a kind of thistle) of the South American wild, are held as distinct species in all botanical works ; y*et the artichoke, in neglect, degenerates into the cardoon^63) The ranunculus aquatilis and the ranunculus hedera ceus are, in like manner, set down as distinct species ; but behold the secret of their difference ! While the former plant remains in the water, its leaves are all finely cut and have their divisions"], [246, "232 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF hairy; but when the stems reach the surface, the leaves developed in the atmosphere are widened, rounded, and simply7 lobed. Should the seeds of this water plant fall upon a soil merely moist with- out being inundated, the result is the ranunculus hederaceus \u2014 the presumed distinct species \u2014 with short stalks, and none of tbe leaves divided into hairy cut work ! (64) To come to a more familiar instance. It is now fully ascertained that the various bread-forming grains, wheat, barley, oats, rye, are resolvable into one. If wheat be sow7n in June, and mown down so as not to be allowed to come to ear till the next season, the product will be found to consist partly of rye or some other of the cereals. Oats have in like manner been transformed into rye, barley, and even wheat. Till a recent period, this phenomenon was doubted ; but it has been tested by experiment, and reported on by so many credible persons, that it can no longer be rejected. And it ap- pears, that poorness of soil has the same effect as mowing down. One observer states that, in a field of wheat near Lucerne, he saw ears re- sembling barley, but with grains similar to rye, growing from the same stem with ears of wheat. (M) Dr. Lindley, who publishes these facts, acknow-"], [247, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 233 ledges there being no theoretical improbability in such transformations, seeing that, \" in orchida- ceous plants, forms just as different as wheat, barley, rye, and oats, have been proved by the most rigorous evidence to be accidental variations of one common form, brought about no one knows how, but before our eyes, and rendered permanent by7 equally* mysterious agency.\" It is more than probable that the greater number of what may be called the domesticated plants, are unsuspected variations of others, which, growing wild, are recognised as different species. One noted in- stance of such transition has been detected within the last few years, in our different kinds of cabbage, savoy, brocoli, and cauliflower. They are all common descendants of a plant which is sometimes found growing wild upon our sea- shores, the brassica oleracea \u2014 a transition which no one can appreciate till he has compared the tough slender stem and small glaucous leaf of the original, with the stout fleshy stem and large succulent leaves, sometimes gathered into a heart several feet in circumference, which he will find in the most familiar of the cabbages. What respect, it may be asked, can we attach to the doctrine of intransibility of species, when"], [248, "234 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF we find its adherents wrong in so many instances. Admit their explanation, that a mere mistake has been made in calling that species which was only variety, what guarantee can we have for the fixity of any so-called species, when it has given way in such instances ? What is species, if it cannot be fixed upon such a vast assemblage as the Thallogens, or even the progeny of thc Telephora sulphurea ? Apart from all theorising about the absolute characters of species, do not these facts show a transibility and intercommunion of forms totally at variance with those general opinions as to fixity which now reign in the scientific world? In the animal kingdom, we have fewer illustra tions of modifiability of transition ; but they tend to exactly the same effect. I shall here pass over the succession of forms which appears in common infusions. Neither shall I enter into the particulars of a late curious investigation by a Danish naturalist, which results in showing alternative forms in the succession of certain animals low in the scale, including the medusa ; that is, as it were, A giving birth to B, B to C, and C to A again. (M) Such matters are as yet obscure, however highly they may promise in time to illustrate this question. Let us rather"], [249, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 235 look to departments of this kingdom which come broadly under the observation of naturalists. In the mollusca there occurs a modifiability of a most remarkable nature. Fresh-water species of these, exposed to brackish water, assume, where able to survive the change, characters in the ex- terior form of the shell proper to their marine congeners, and involving differences froni the original animal much greater than is usually suffi- cient with naturalists to constitute a distinction of species, if not of tribe or family. Many years ago, Pennant remarked the singular modification of stomach which the common trout appears to have undergone in the lakes of the county of Galway, in consequence of feeding on shell-fish. The integument has become as thick as the gizzard of a bird, manifestly in consequence of an effort of nature to accommodate herself to the peculiar food of the animal. So also, when a common gull was fed upon corn, the parietes of the stomach were found, on examination after death, to be thickened. (\") The peculiar forms of the mandibles of birds are grounds of specific dis tinction ; yet it is now ascertained that these are variable under particular conditions as to food. It has been tried with confined birds ; and even"], [250, "236 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF in a wild state there occur individuals strangely modified in this respect, the magpie, woodpecker, and rook, having all been found with the crossed mandibles of the loxia. (68) Look also at the changes from the wild animals to those domes ticated ones which are known to be descended from them. \" When the eggs of the wild goose,\" says Professor Low, \" are taken, and the young are supplied with food in unlimited quantity, the result is remarkable. The intestines, ancl with them the abdomen, become so much enlarged, that the animal nearly loses the power of flight, and the powerful muscles which enabled him in a wild state to take such flights, become feeble from disease, and his long wings are rendered unserviceable. The beautiful bird that out stripped the flight of the eagle, is now a captive without a chain.\" Another change is the transi tion from grey to white plumage. In the domes tication of the pig, the author last quoted admits that there are reductions of the number of teeth, and variations of the number of the dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and caudal vertebr\u00e6, producing differences greater than what are usually regarded as sufficient to constitute species. But the most striking observations on this subject are those of"], [251, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 237 M. Roulin, made during a residence of several years in Columbia, relative to the races which had been introduced there in a domesticated state by the early voyagers, and allowed to run wild during the three centuries which have since elapsed. As an example, the hog : \" Wandering all day in the wood, this animal has lost nearly all marks of servitude ; its ears have become erect, its head broadened, and raised at the upper part, and its colour has been rendered permanent.\" It has, in short, returned to a strict resemblance to the wild boar of France. The cow, also, from the cessation of the practice of milking, has lost the abundant flow of milk whicii is found in her species in Europe : to get milk from her at all, it is necessary that her calf should be left with her. M. Roulin arrived at the following conclusions : that animals naturalized in new countries undergo durable changes, bringing their organization into accordance with the climates in which they are destined to live ; and that habits of impendence soon make the domestic species resume the cha racters of the wild species from which they have sprung. We have here, it will be owned, equal proof that the tuskless hog of our farm-yards is the same animal which roams the forest in formi-"], [252, "238 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF dable state and armature, as that the wild boar is the same with the domestic pig. It is difficult, after what we have now seen, to regard the idea of species or specific distinction as descriptive of a fact in nature ; it must be held as merely applicable to certain appearances pre sented, perhaps transiently, to our notice. The history of the question seems to be this. Natu ralists, starting with a limited fund of observa tion, \u2014 mainly, indeed, consisting of the remark which the most superficial observation .supplies, that hke usually produces like, \u2014 lay it down as an axiom that species is a determinate thing. In a little time, certain modifiabilities are observed. To maintain the axiom intact, these are called varieties. Afterwards, much greater variabilities are witnessed, even to the dissolution of genera among the cryptogams and cereals, and the com munity of alg\u00e6 and fungi \u2014 water and land plants. Still, to keep the axiom whole, these are held in doubt, or relegated to a place in the elastic region of the varieties. Such is the stage which we have now attained. But this is a process the reverse of philosophical : it is to start with a theory, and then make facts succumb to it. Were the process reversed and the facts taken first, we should see"], [253, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 239 that a great modifiability exists in organic nature, especially in the humbler departments of the two kingdoms. And seeing that this modifiability presents itself within the scope of a very7 limited experience, it might safely be inferred that some thing much greater would be detected if our range of experience were extended, especially since the world presents us with results which can only be naturally accounted for in this manner. It is here a fact to be specially re marked, that the greatest variability, the most striking instances of transition or intercommunion of forms, are offered in the lower grades of being. In these departments of nature, generation is rapid and abundant in comparison with the repro duction of the higher forms. What requires perhaps a century in the one case (say a series of three generations) will be accomplished in a day in the other. Nothing, therefore, seems more natural than that phenomena connected with the reproduction of the higher animals should require a much longer time to be evolved than those connected with the lower. The time may be, in the one case, such as to fall within our range of observation (and this range, as far as scientific accuracy is concerned, is but a day),"], [254, "240 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF while in the other case it may be, and indeed, on a just comparison, we should expect it to be, beyond even the whole space of what is called the historical era. Such is precisely the point to w*hich the present theory would lead us. We see that permanency of specific distinctions in the higher organisms would sink, as it has done in so many of the lower, if we had as long a time to observe their reproductive history as would, in embryo- logy, be equivalent to the space of time during which we have observed the humbler creatures. We see this persistency and think it fixed, exactly as men have hitherto seen the solar position in the universe. We advance among the stars at the rate of two millions of millions of miles a year; but astronomers tell us that it would take ninety millions of years to enable us to pass through the whole, even at this rapid rate. Well, therefore, might the unassisted eye and unexamining intellect presume the place of the solar system to be fixed, for it is evident that no human tradition could record changes indicating the translation. Yet we do pass on to Hercules, although forty centu- ries failed to remark the circumstance. So many specific distinctions in the higher animals have been changed in the course of the vast periods"], [255, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 241 which geology shows to have elapsed since the commencement of organization upon earth, although, during that inappreciable segment of the great cycle which has passed since man woke to the mysteries of nature, no single transition of the kind might have been observed. The whole case reminds us greatly of the objection which stood against the earth's motion from the days of Aristarchus downwards, that there ought in that case to be an observable parallax. As there was no observable parallax, because the earth's orbit is an insignificant space in comparison with the distance of the stars, so is our observation of animal changes insufficient to show transitions of species in the higher grades of the kingdom, because it is a mere span in comparison with the vast ages actually7 concerned in the phenomenon. A similar principle of explanation applies to the alleged tendency of variety to be obliterated. Whde it is only to be expected that a single animal showing an originality of form will fail to impress it on its posterity, if it be absorbed in alliance with animals possessing no such pecu liarities, there is no reason to believe that a variety uniting with a creature like itself will not have descendants of its own character. We judge on M"], [256, "242 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF this question in the midst of a fully-peopled world ; but we must cast back our minds to a time when it was only in the course of being silled with living things. We must think of a time when, for exam ple, over large portions of the surface mountain tracts were rising, perhaps beside low and marshy grounds, or when forests began to spread over extensive regions. Here a new field of existence is presented. The fecundity of nature has or dained that her creatures shall ever be pressing upon the verge of the local means of subsistence. A colonizing principle accordingly comes into play. On such an occasion, it might be that individual wading birds began to advance into dry grounds and woods, elected to the new life perhaps by some of those varieties of appetency which occur in all tribes ; thus exposing them selves to new influences, and ceasing to expe rience those formerly operating, until, by slow degrees, in the course of a vast space of time, the characters of the pheasant tribes were evoked. (69) Here, it will be at once perceived, re-absorption of peculiarities was not likely to occur, for the field of colonization, so to speak, was sufficiently wide to allow of the new families wandering farther and farther away* from the original grounds"], [257, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 243 and the ancestral tribes, while return was pre vented by the full population continually pressing behind. Altogether, this presents a very different view of varieties from that which is commonly presented, when we see a single peculiar indi vidual standing in the midst of, and necessarily allying itself to, the original stock. The process of variation as a consequence of changed condi tions and appetencies being left unchecked, and that for a vast space of time, we obtain at length creatures fixedly peculiar; that is, however, merely creatures which appear so, because there is no replacing them in the former conditions in this densely-peopled globe, and, though there were, the retrogression to the anterior forms would require a space of time beyond the range of human observation. It may now be remarked, that, in this hy7po thetic variability, the possibility of re-union may, and in all probability does, depend upon the de gree of similarity which still exists in the different individuals, supposing them to be members of the same stirps or line of being, for I believe that no others are capable of intermixture. As has been remarked by a venerable naturalist \u2014 \" Many bulbous roots that have been increased during a M 2"], [258, "244 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF long succession of years by offsets, become abso lutely incapable of bearing seed ; and it is not more strange that plants which in different soils and climates have diverged from the original form of the first created individual, should refuse to bear seed by the one which has departed most widely, ancl yet produce it readily by another, which still agrees with it in some important points.\" (70) Admit this, and the grand basis of specific distinction, the possibility of intermix ture, can no longer be laid hold of. Plants and animals of one line are only to be expected to unite, which, being of one grade of organization, are also sufficiently near to each other in those peculiarities liable to modification from external causes, on which the so-called distinctions of species are grounded. The illustrations of our hypothesis are now closed. We have seen that, even judging from short spaces of time, there is a great and incon testable modifiability of organic forms, \u2014 so great as to have absorbed the presumed distinctions of species in many noted instances. We have seen that this modifiability, by some hidden law, im mediately obeys external conditions. It has also been seen that, though no transition from grade"], [259, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 245 to grade was ever observed to take place, the means and mode by which it could naturally happen are not concealed from us ; they are pic- tured before our ey*es in the metamorphosis of the tadpole, and even practically exemplified in a narrow degree in the natural history of the bee. It has been shown that no organism is inde- pendent, but all stand in a web of intimate rela- tion, undeniably indicating that their origin is one connected phenomenon. It has been seen that the higher animals, when their organization is examined, are only improvements upon the lower \u2014 advanced forms of the same beings ; and the same holds good regarding plants. In con- formity, too, with this gradation of forms, is the succession of the actual animals throughout the geological ages; \u2014 a fact most important \u2014 not merely one calling to be explained, as is at the utmost allowed by men of science of the present day, but one which helps to explain, \u2014 a piece of actual tangible evidence, and bearing wholly, when taken in connexion with proofs of other kinds, in favour of the natural origin of species. Surely7 when, in addition to all this, we learn that life is believed by many men of science to spring occasionally7, even now, from inorganic elements"], [260, "246 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF \u2014 when we find that, moreover, it is generally admitted by that class of men to be in itself a simply natural phenomenon, we cannot but say that at least vestiges have been seen of the natural ordinances or arrangements, by which the Almighty Father caused this globe (and pro bably others within our ken) to be overspread with the many creatures whose perfection is his praise. Rigid proof is not, indeed, attained: but we have all the evidence which is attainable in the case. It is evidence from various quar ters, all perfectly homogeneous ; it harmonizes with everything else which science tells us of the history of the universe ; it supplants a mean with an exalted idea of the Deity, and has nothing opposed to it but the prejudices fonned in the nonage of our race. For these reasons, I must, till disproof is offered, regard the theoiy of Progressive Development as the true explana tion of the origin of organic nature. The simplest and most primitive types of being, under a law to which that of like production is subordinate, gave birth to a type superior to it in compositeness of organization and endowment of faculties ; this again produced the next higher, and so on to the highest. There has been, in short, a uni-"], [261, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 247 versal gestation of nature, analogous to that of the individual being, and attended as little by circumstances of a startling or miraculous kind as the silent advance of an ordinary mother from one week to another of her pregnancy. We see but the chronicle of one or two great areas, within which the development has reached the highest forms. In some others, as Australia and the islands of the Pacific, development has not yet passed through the whole of its stages, because, owing to the comparatively late uprise of the land, the terrestrial portion of the development was there commenced more recently. It would commence and proceed in any new appropriate area, on this or any other sphere, exactly7 as it commenced upon our area in the time of the earliest fossiliferous rocks, whichever these are. Nay, it starts every hour with common infusions, and in similar humble theatres, and would there proceed through all tbe subsequent stages, granting suitable space and conditions.

Early in this century, M. Lamarck, one of the most distinguished of modern naturalists, sug gested that the gradation of animals depended upon some general law which it was important for us to discover. So far he was right ; but the theory7 which he consequently formed with regard to the causes of the varieties of animated being was so far from being adequate to account for the facts, that it has had scarcely a single adherent. What M. Lamarck chiefly grounded upon was the well-known physiological fact, that use or exer cise strengthens and enlarges an organ, while disuse equally atrophies it. He conceived that, an animal being brought into new circumstances, and called upon to accommodate itself to these, the exertions which it consequently made to that effect caused the rise of new parts : on the con trary, when new circumstances left certain exist ing parts unused, these parts gradually ceased to exist. Something analogous was, he thought, produced in vegetables, by changes in their nutri tion, in their absorptions and transpirations, and in the quantity of caloric, light, air, and moisture which they received. This principle, with time,"], [263, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 249 he deemed sufficient to have produced the ad- vance from the monad to the mammal. His illustrations were chiefly of the following nature. The bird which is attracted to the water by the necessity of seeking there its food, wishes to move about on the surface of the flood, and for this purpose strikes out its toes. Through the consequent repeated separations of the toes, the skin uniting them at the roots is extended and at length becomes webbed. In like manner, the shore bird which has no desire to swim, but has to approach the water for food, is constantly sub ject to sink in the mud. The bird, disliking this, exerts all its efforts to lengthen its legs ; the result is, that, by continual habit for many gene- rations, the legs of this order do at length become long and bare, as we see them. The error of the theory is in giving this adaptive principle too much to do. What undoubtedly is effectual in modifying the exterior peculiarities of animals was obviously insufficient to account for the great grades of organization. In the present day, we have superior light from geology and physiology, and hence arises my suggestion of a process analogous to ordinary gestation for advancing organic life through its grades in the course of M 3"], [264, "250 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF a long but definite space of time, with only a recourse to external conditions as a means of producing the exterior characters. It must never theless be acknowledged that the germ of this natural view of the history of the world is pre sented in the work of Lamarck. But the idea that any of the lower animals have been concerned in any way with the origin of man \u2014 is not this degrading ? Degrading is a term expressive of a notion of the human mind, and the human mind is liable to prejudices which prevent its notions from being invariably correct. Were we acquainted for the first time with the circumstances attending the production of an in dividual of our race, we might equally think them degrading, and be eager to deny them, and ex clude them from the admitted truths of nature. Knowing this fact familiarly and bey7ond contra diction, a healthy and natural mind finds no diffi culty in regarding it complacently. So also, on becoming aware of the genetic history of our species, we might expect a rational and well ordered mind to receive the idea with submission, as a view of the manner in which Divine Provi dence has been pleased in this instance to work. One source of the prejudice here to be contended"], [265, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 251 with rests in our associations with the word an cestry. From seeing our immediate seniors pos sessed of venerable qualities, we naturally incline to venerate an ancestry ; we presume its con stituent elements to be something superior to ourselves. When called upon, therefore, to place any of the inferior orders of Being in this rela tion, a shock unavoidably follows. But here the error lies in transferring our idea of the qualities of a sire or grandsire to a collective ancestiy. The elder people of the earth are in reality its children, and we are its true senate. The feeling due to early generations is the half-pitying bene volence which w*e daily bestow upon childhood. It follows that the still earlier generations ante cedent to the perfection of the human type, ought to be regarded with an extension of this same feeling \u2014 the modification of it winch humane natures daily exemplify* in their treatment of the inferior animals. Our children, it may be said, are the representatives of the first simple and impulsive men of the earth : the lower animals represent the earlier pre-human stages of life. The right conception of the case is, that in these stages we are not to look for what is venerable, but, on the contrary, for what is humble and"], [266, "252 HYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF elementary. We are to expect but tbe primiti\u0153 of man's masterful life \u2014 something not even as cending to the dignity of \" the infant mewling in its nurse's arms.\" If thus prepared, we should experience no shock on hearing that the human form was preceded genealogically by others of humbler aspect, \u2014 no more than we are on learn ing that every individual amongst us passes through the characters of the invertebrate, fish, and reptile, before he is permitted to breathe the breath of life. A deep moral principle seems involved in the history of the origin of man. He is the undoubted chief of all creatures, and as such may well have a character and destiny in some respects peculiar and far exalted above the rest ; but it appears that his relation to them is, after all, one of kindred. Along with his autho rity over them, he bears from nature an obligation to abstain from wantonly injuring them, and as far as possible, to cherish and protect them. Good men feel this duty, as if it were a command from a source above themselves. It seems to them, that if the helplessness of childhood calls for kind and gentle treatment, much more does the essentially weaker character of the dumb creature. And if the innocence of infancy is"], [267, "THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS. 253 touching, still more so is the even more harmless character which (overlooking carnivorous instincts implanted in certain families for a wise purpose) attaches to the lower animals. It is common, under the influence of prejudice, to do gross in justice to the characters of these denizens of nature's common. We do not sufficiently reflect on their respectable qualities. Yet we must go to the dog for a type of the virtue of fidelity, and to the bee for that of industry. The parental affection of many* animals is not below, if it is not con siderably above, that of human mothers. Man nowhere exemplifies the virtue of patience in the practical perfection in which we see it in the horse, and many other creatures which become the slaves of his convenience.

It is certainly very desirable that our theory could have been subjected to this test ; but it cannot be, for naturalists are as yet only struggling towards true classifications in both kingdoms. It becomes necessary, nevertheless, that we should make some inquiry into that order which has long been alleged to exist in animated nature, as, if any such thing truly exist, it either must agree with a genealogical system, or become its con demnation. The result of my own investigations is, that"], [269, "255 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. there is an order in animated nature, but that it has hitherto been much misunderstood both by those who incline to a theory of development and others. The former naturally took hold of the idea of gradations, because it generally accorded with the notion of development. They pointed to that \" chain of being,\" or series of ascending forms, which had long been supposed to extend between the animalcule and the human being. It was on the other hand successfully shown that beings did not form \"a single and continuous series ;\" that it was \" impossible to place all living animals in such an order that we may always pass from one species to another by fol lowing a decrease in perfection.\" \"On the one hand, there are classes of animals so insulated, that nothing connects them with others.\" \" On the other, there are types of organization which are absolutely indivisible, and of which the most perfect beings are superior to the mean of ano ther type, whde the most imperfect are inferior to it.\" All this is true : it remained unanswered by the advocates of the development theory; and such was the position of the question when the earlier editions of the present work made their appearance. But the error actually lay in the"], [270, "256 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL original idea of a chain of being. The animal kingdom (and, by consideration of parity, we may presume the vegetable also) consists of a plurality of series going on side by side with each other, but not all to the same point in the scale. No wonder, accordingly, that some appear insulated, or that the highest of some types are superior to the meanest of others, while the most imperfect appear inferior. Nor is this merely a hypothetical view of the animal kingdom. It is strongly pointed to by some of the most interesting discoveries in embryology. It is supported by several important considerations regarding the general characters of particular series. It likewise harmonizes with that order of fossils, which I have ventured to describe as not something calling in itself for explanation, but a fact which we may look to as one of the means of explaining something else \u2014 the whole history of organization upon earth. Finally, such reforma tion as this new view calls for in our classi fications, is accordant in its general demands with all those recently effected by the greatest naturalists, by7 which external and comparatively accidental characters are overlooked, and only the more essential affinities regarded. If it goes beyond the march of living naturalists, it goes in"], [271, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 257 the direction in which they* are going, and over ground, to which I believe they must quickly come, whether they adopt a genealogical view of the organic world or not. The divisions of the animal kingdom, as we find it in Cuvier, are partly into grades, with a regard to dignity of organization \u2014 first into Ver tebrata (having an internal skeleton) and Inverte brata, and afterwards into such divisions as these of the vertebrata \u2014 namely, Mammalia, Birds, Reptiles, Fishes. In these grades are compre hended animals of very various character, \u2014 ani mals which only agree in this particular of a community of grade or rank. But other divi sions in the common classifications are into groups or series of animals closely allied to each other in form and of one general character, \u2014 as, for example, the cephalopoda, the echinodermata, the Crustacea. The one kind of division may be said to be transverse, the other longitudinal. Such a diversity gives rise to a suspicion that there is something wrong, something out of ac cordance with nature. And so it is. The true fundamental divisions are entirely of the latter kind \u2014 longitudinal ; there only do we find per sistence of characters ; the other so-called divi-"], [272, "258 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL sions are only the marks of stages which the true divisions, the Stirpes of being, have reached in their respective courses. It is nevertheless ne cessary, in the meantime, to keep the existing classification in view, and to use its language, in order that my own views may be intelligible. Cuvier divided the Invertebrata into three great masses, the Radiata, the Articulata, and Mollusca. Of these the two last appear as co-ordinate, though distinct from each other ; while the Radiata, again, may, excepting one class, be considered as forming a kind of basis for the whole kingdom. The Radiata are all of them animals of ex ceedingly simple structure, mostly inhabitants of the waters, many of them propagating not by ova, but by division of their bodies, or by the throwing out of little bud-like excrescences. In this lower region are comprehended the Infusory animal cules, Internal Parasites (Entozoa), Sponges, Polyps, Sea-nettles (Acalephv), and some other obscure classes. Some of these appear to be distinct and independent series, which advance no further ; such, in particular, are the internal parasites, which necessarily do not pass to any higher grade, because they have no sphere for"], [273, "259 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. further development. Others form the roots, as it w*ere, of higher families. There are two admitted methods of investi gating the affinities of beings. One is to observe the connexion between the forms of the mature organisms ; another is to examine the embryotic progress, and watch the succession of forms there presented. It has for some time been ascertained that no animal, in the course of its development, passes through the forms of all the animals meaner than itself. For example, the sea-nettle is at one time like the monad, an infusory animal cule, and then like the polyp ; the mollusk is successively like the monad and poly*p, but never like the sea-nettle. The articulate animal, again, is never like the polyp or sea-nettle, but proceeds at once from the monad form to that of the worm. This Professor Owen calls being \" obedient to the law of unity of organization only in its monad stage.\" (71) The fact has been held as a difficulty in the way of the doctrine of unity ; but perhaps it is only* one of the same nature with that inti mated regarding the assumed scale of being. I see animals classed by their affinities in distinct lines, or series, winch I regard as stirpes or races. I would therefore expect the unity of organization"], [274, "260 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL to be liable to some such limitation as Mr. Owen points out. ls it not, in reality, that each stirps has a unity of organization for itself, or, in other words, that there is such a unity only as far as each particular series of animals is concerned ? These breaks in unity and the breaks in the chain of being are but one thing : they are only disturbances to our preconceived ideas, not to a true view of nature drawn from its realities. I shall not attempt to place all these obscure animals in genealogical series. The state of zoological science demands that such an effort should be postponed for several years to come. Let us limit our attention to one class, the Echi nodermata, or star-fishes, which are perhaps im properly ranked with other Radiata, seeing that their character is so much superior. In general highly organized, and enjoying free movement at the bottom of the sea, these animals are signally destructive. Admitted to be in their lower forms intimately allied to the Polpys, they probably start in some portion of that extensive order. In their own class, however, as far as traceable back wards, they commence with the encrinus or stone lily, a group of animals of which we have seen many varieties flourishing in the early seas, but"], [275, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 261 which are now nearly extinct. The creature con sisted of a stomach and arms, surrounded by long tentacles or arms, placed upon the top of a stalk fixed to the sea-bottom, the whole being com posed of numberless minute calcareous {dates, connected by gelatinous substance. In more ad vanced forms of the same order, (as the comatula and the extinct marsupite,) the body and arms desert the stalk, and betake themselves to a free swimming life ; but, as has been elsewhere men tioned, the y7oung comatula lives for a time as an encrinus ; that is, upon a stalk. Seeing that the same animal, in an earlier embryotic stage, repre sents a poly7pidom, we conclude that in the poly piaria is the origin of the echinodermatous line : it is first the polypidom, then the encrinus, then the free-swimming comatula, or feather star, the last being one of the most graceful animals in existence. In the higher genera of the latter family, the tentacles are shortened and reduced in number. In the Ophiur\u00e6, there are only five long and simple rays projecting from the central body7. Afterwards, in the Asteriad\u0153, or true star fishes, the central part dilates step by step, until it fills up the interstices between the rays, and the form becomes a pentagonal disk. From this"], [276, "262 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL there is a clear passage to the Echinus or sea urchin, which is merely a spheroidal animal in a calcareous case, through which numberless spines or tentacles project, for locomotion and the col lection of food. This form again becomes elon gated into the cylindrical soft-bodied Holothuria, with a circle of tentacles at the oral extremity ; thence the transition is easy to the genus Fistu larid\u0153, animals externally worm-like, ancl pos sessing the rudiment of a heart, with red blood in the arteries, so that, in this last echinoderm, we maybe said to have come nearly, if not fully abreast with, the annelides, and to be approximating to some of the humbler fishes. (\") The reader cannot fail to have been struck by the great number of forms passed through in this line, in comparison with any other, before leaving the radiate sub-kingdom ; but, in reality, the echino dermata, though of radiated form, are much superior to the rest of that division in their organization, which is, if not complicated in the usual sense of naturalists, full of extremely curious minute work. Their whole destiny seems to be of a high kind, for in the stone record their line of forms stands parallel with others in which the whole of the three lowest sub-kingdoms are"], [277, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 263 passed through. Polypiarian animals and encri nites appear in the Silurian and many subsequent formations ; at the commencement of the carboni genous era, the latter are so abundant that we walk over large tracts of country, where the rocks beneath our feet are almost wholly composed of their remains. The Asteriad\u00e6 appear in the upper Silurians, and are but faintly seen until the Lias, when they become conspicuous. In the Oolite, the Echinid\u00e6 make their appearance. These are the last which we could expect to be preserved in rocks, as the higher families possess no hard parts ; otherwise, we might perhaps have seen the succession of this class of fossils con tinued into the holothuri\u00e6 and fistularid\u00e6. It cannot fail to be noticed how well the rjrogression of forms agrees with the order of their appearance in the geological ages. The ground is now cleared for the two grand series of invertebrate animals, and first of the Articulata. These are generally* describable as animals \" composed of a succession of rings, formed by the skin or outward integument, which from its hardness constitutes a kind of external skeleton;\" one class, however, the Annelides, have no hard investment. The pedigree of the"], [278, "264 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL Articulata is very brief. The embryo in most classes passes at once from the monad to the worm form, and then the articulate character is assumed. It can, therefore, scarcely7 be said that the radiate sub-kingdom comes before the articu late, though the one is lower in organization than the other. There is indeed reason to believe that the great classes of the Articulata are distinct stirpes, the commencement of each of which is little more than a step from the inorganic form of matter. This may seem inconsistent with the maxim, Natura per saltum nihil agit ; but maxims must be obedient to facts, not facts to maxims, and we may deem that a leap which in reality is none. The necessity of taking liberal views of the procedure of nature in the development of the organic world, is impressed upon us by a charac ter found in the very first order of the articulata to which our attention is called. That the An nelides (worms) are the humblest of the articulate animals, there is now no doubt ; yet, unlike their superiors, almost all of them have red blood, a feature of the highest sub-kingdom. Four leading forms in this class are described. Of the Tubi colid\u0153, or those inhabiting tubes, the serpula is"], [279, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 265 an example. It forms for its habitation, usually upon some sea-immersed stone, an irregularly7 twisted calcareous tube, out of which it presents, floating in the water, a fan-like branchial appa ratus, of beautiful colours. The second order, Suctoria, is represented by the well-known leech ; the third by the earth-worm; the fourth by the sea-mouse (aphrodita). In all of these groups we see distinct advances in organization, and this is traceable in some in an interesting conformity with changes of scene and mode of life, from fixed situations to free movement in the sea, from thence to the shore, and thence again to the land. From the Nais, a simple marine worm which at the recess of tide burrows in the sand, there is a clear passage to the common earth-worm, which adopts a similar retreat on land, and comes to the surface when rain is falling. The fourth order, Dorsibranchiata, so called because of gill tufts ranged along the back, have an equally clear affinity, implying ancestral relationship to certain land animals, which, however, naturalists at present regard as an independent class. The nereis, a well known dorsibranchiate, is an ani mal of great length, composed of a consecutive series of rings, each having a couple of processes N"], [280, "266 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL at each side, which are used as oars for propelling the body through the water. One species is four feet long, and consists of several hundred seg ments. By conversion of the water-breathing apparatus into one fitted for aerial respiration, an increase of firmness and density to the external integument, and the development of a couple of limbs for each ring of the body, we see the nereis, as it were, transmuted into the Myriapod.(n) Here, however, there may be more than one line of passage ; for the two great families of the my riapods, the Julid\u00e6 and Scolopendrid\u00e6, are diverse in character, the former being vegetable feeders, the latter carnivorous, and it appears as a rule in the genetic system, that true carnivores are always apart. Confining our view to the Scolopendrid\u00e6, we see a remarkable continuity of character and habits transmitted to them from the presumed marine ancestor, (nereis,) allowing for the altered medium of existence. The scolopendra is an animal furnished with powerful destructive organs ; and, living under stones and the bark of trees, and in fissures generally, it is his custom to wind insidiously along, and dart upon any little animal which comes in his way. Of the nereides, on the other hand, we are told that they \" usually live"], [281, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 267 in the excavations of littoral rocks, in the hollows of sponges, in the interstices of the radicles of thalassiophytes, under stones, and in general in all bodies which present fissures more or less pro found . . . They all appear to feed upon animal substances. . . M. Bose tells us they7 live upon polypi and small worms, on which they throw themselves, by7 darting the anterior part of their body, which they have first contracted.\" The next articulate class demanding attention is the Crustacea, animals in which the annular sections are covered with a calcareous shell, and provided with jointed limbs, the respiratory appa ratus being branchial ; all are aquatic, except some of the higher genera, which occasionally adventure upon the land. They are in two great groups, entomostraca and malacostraca, the former being the simpler, and exclusively marine. Em merich considers the Trilobites which figure so conspicuously in the early rocks, as between the two divisions, but most nearly allied to the first ; whence it would appear that the Crustacea which make so early an appearance in the rock series, are humble animals, only preceded in their own sub-kingdom by7 a group, which, from their slight forms, might be ill-adapted for preservation in n 2"], [282, "268 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL strata exposed after deposition to a high tempe rature. The geological history of the Crustacea tallies in other points with their gradation. In the triassic epoch come the Macruri, which pre vail to the present time ; afterwards, in the tertiary era, come the Brachyura. These are the fossil orders which have been best studied, and it is M. Agassiz who says, \" they succeed each other in the series of formations in the order of their organic gradation.\" The same naturalist remarks \" the intimate analogy between these dif ferent types and the phases of the embryonic development of the Crustacea, which MM. Rathkc and Erdl have afforded us the means of becoming acquainted with.\" As elsewhere observed, the young of the decapoda are of the entomostracous form, and thus denote a passage of the one from the other. In one family7 of the Crustacea, there is a striking illustration of what I regard as the true history of species. This is tbe family to which the well known hermit-crabs belong (Paguri,) distributed extensively in the tropical American islands, and upon our own coasts. Animals of this kind live in molluscan shells deserted by their proper tenants. They select one at the first for their"], [283, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 269 residence, and afterwards, as they increase in size, they remove to larger ones. With the hind part of the body7 inserted in the hollow shell, they present the head and feet outwards. They move about in the shallow water, upon the shore, and even upon dry7 land, with great freedom, dragging their adopted mansion after them. A very slight examination of these animals shows that they are adapted by special peculiarities for this kind of life. In the common British hermit crab, the third and fourth pairs of locomotive limbs are of small size, being buried wholly within the shell, where they are applied to the columellar fold, as a means of fastening the animal in the recess. Farther in, and also employed in fastening the body* to the shell, is the caudal part, with two holders developed for this express purpose, and as rough as a file. The hold is still further secured in some species by row*s of suckers along the abdomen. Add to all this, that, for want of room at the mouth of the shell, only one of the pincer claws is well developed, usually the right, while only the two front pairs of feet are used for locomotion, and we see that, whether we take these crabs as a species, a genus, or a family, their ordinary form \u2014 that thing which naturalists"], [284, "270 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL regard as immutable, and as originally the effect of a special creative effort \u2014 is in direct relation to the existence and forms of turbinate shells formerly possessed by a different class of animals, \u2014 which must therefore have existed before the hermit crabs. Now mark the credulity to which the adherents of immutability must here be re duced. They must believe that the Creator, having a particular regard to the fact of molluscan shells lying useless on the shore, formed, by special care or fiat, a family of crabs to occupy them. They must believe that the roughness of the caudal appendages, the development of suck ers along the abdomen, the reduction of the two hind pairs of limbs, and the left pincer claw, were all subjects for this special care, and were beyond the power of what an eminent geologist calls \" vulgar nature.\" Surely the Deus ex ma china was never more remarkably exemplified. See, on the other hand, how these facts are ac counted for on the development theory. According to this new light, the hermit crabs are simply a portion of some greater section of the crustacean class. Their peculiarities are modifications from the parent form, brought about in the course of generations, in consequence of an appetency which"], [285, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 271 had led these creatures to seek a kind of shelter in turbinate shells. They are as truly creatures of the Great God, as if they had been made in the manner of a human artist modelling a figure. But the means were inherent natural forces in the constitution of the original tribe, tending, in generation, to accommodate organic form to phy sical circumstances. The next class in general rank is the Insecta, a wonderfully varied group, yet all agreeing in having thirteen segments and three pairs of legs ; all, moreover, respiring by means of trache\u00e6 or tubes permeating the body, \u2014 an arrangement having reference to their peculiar mode of loco motion, which, in the majority of species, is by flight through the air. The fact of the greater number of insect genera passing, in their larva state, through the annelidan or myriapodous form, points to these classes as their genetic origin ; yet this is a point on which the benefit of further investigation is desirable. In the case of the Arachnida (mites and spiders), the highest articu late class, no humbler form is traceable in the embryo ; it is therefore impossible to assign them any pedigree. Can it be possible that the arach nida, or these with the insecta, have sprung"], [286, "272 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL almost or wholly at once from inorganic elements under the proper electric influences ? On tins subject, we are quite unprepared to make any positive affirmation ; but it certainly is remarkable that in no department of the animal kingdom, besides the infusoria and entozoa, have there been more frequent appearances of an aboriginal com mencement of life than in the insecta. The acarus so often produced from certain solutions, where ova were rigidly excluded, is a lowly mem ber of the arachnida. We now come to the Mollusca, a portion of the animal kingdom, the importance of which, in point of numbers and the part they play in crea tion, none but students of zoology could fully appreciate. The infinite variety of bivalve and univalve shells presented upon our own coasts and brought from all parts of the world, will convey some idea of the multitude of forms com prehended under this sub-kingdom. The whole mass is after all resolvable into three divisions ; one of them comprising headless mollusks in bivalve shells ; the other two, headed mollusks in univalve shells (some, however, of all the three divi sions being naked). The whole sub-kingdom ap pears to have a very brief genesis in the radiata, the"], [287, "273 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. only preceding forms in embryo being the infu sorial and polypian. Here, too, as in the Articu lata, we find that we must start at a point very near the fountain-head of organic existence. In the headless division, naturalists place three sub-divisions, called by them classes, in the fol- lowing rank, according to ascending grade of organization \u2014 Tunicata, Brachiopoda, and La- mellibranchiata. The two latter are the shell-fish of popular observation, headless, and mostly sessile, or destined to spend their lives in fixed positions. The Tunicata are similar in all essen- tial respects, except in being of humbler organiz- ation, and inclosed, not in shells, but in a carti- laginous or coriaceous integument ; whence their name. It thus appears that the Brachiopoda, which are the predominant fossils of the Lower Silurian era, are the first animals ice meet ivith in this line, having parts capable of commemorating their existence. While the Brachiopoda are generally inhabitants of deep seas, the Lamellibranchiata, among which are included the oyster, muscle, and other testacea, affect the beds of shallow seas, whence they spread in a variety of genera, to wards shores, the mouths of rivers, and into fresh water. The Lamellibranchiates are higher than N 3"], [288, "274 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL the preceding class ; they are the first bivalves which possess a true hinge. It is also remark able that, with the decline of the brachiopods, at an early point in the secondary formation, rises the lamellibranchiate class. There is here, there fore, an improvement in organization, an advance in habitat landward, and a succession of existence in the geological ages, all in harmonious connec tion. Nor is this all. The lamellibranchiata are again divisible into monomyaria and dimy aria, the former having one adductor muscle, and the latter two ; the former, moreover, being inter mediate between the brachiopods and dimyaria in respect of non-symmetrical form. Now the mono myaria succeed the brachiopods as an abundant and predominating form, and are succeeded again, in that respect, by the dimyaria. This beautiful harmony between the fossil history of the acephalous mol lusks and their order in progressive organization is expressly declared by M. Agassiz. The three highest molluscan classes, univalved, possessing heads, and with hardly an exception destined for independent locomotion, stand apart from the bivalve orders; generally superior in organization, as beseems their higher destiny, but not on that account to be held as an advanced"], [289, "275 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. form in the same genealogy7. The lowest uni valve class \u2014 called Pteropoda, from their mode of progression by a couple of wing-like membranes projecting from the neck \u2014 may be described as marine slugs, generally of small size, many of them naked, others protected by a very delicate shell, which swim through the ocean in vast mul titudes ; one species (elio) being in such abun dance in the circumpolar ocean as to form the chief food ofthe whale. Professor Edward Forbes expresses his opinion that the larva of the ptero pod wdl yet most likely be found to resemble an ascidian poly*pe ; inferring a very brief descent from the starting-point of life in its class. The Gasteropoda \u2014 a class of many families and genera, including limpets, whelks, cowries, snails, etc. \u2014 have comparatively a high organization, the nervous system more concentrated, the nutritive more elaborate, but yet are of sluggish habits, usually moving by alternate contractions and expansions of a fleshy disk placed upon their stomachs ; hence the name of the class. Many of the gasteropods are naked, others possessed of but slender protection. A large proportion are vegetable feeders, the marine species battening upon sea-weed, the terrestrial species upon herb-"], [290, "276 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL age and fruit; the rest are flesh-eaters, but the general character of the Gasteropoda as a class is harmless, like that of the herbivorous mammalia. A clear gradation of forms passes through some of the families, from the simple cone of the limpet to the spiral of the snail. The descent of the class appears to be from some families of the preceding ; for \" they all,\" says a minute observer of nature, (\") \" commence life under the same form, both of shell and animal ; namely, a very simple spiral, helicoid shell, and an animal fur nished with two ciliated wings or lobes, by which it can swim freely through the fluid in which it is contained. At this stage of the animal's exist ence, it corresponds to the permanent state of a Pteropod.\" In the univalve mollusks, as in the bivalves, it clearly appears that the humblest families are destined to a fixed place in the depths of the ocean. As we advance through the higher groups, we find, in parallel steps with an improvement in the organs of animal life (for example, the allot ment of the sexes to different individuals), an advance in the sphere of existence, to a life on the surface of the ocean, to fresh water, and even to dry land. The humble Helicid\u0153 (snails), a"], [291, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 277 family of the Gasteropoda, are the first animals which we encounter as adventuring upon the firm surface of the globe. And it is interesting to remark, in this progression, the requisite change in the mode of respiration \u2014 namely, from bran chi\u00e6, the apparatus necessary in aquatic life, to a vascular air-sac, the first form of lungs \u2014 the proper breathing organ of terrestrial animals. In the peculiarly destructive Cephalopoda, we recognise the highest organization of which the molluscan form appears capable ; it includes the orthoceratites, ammonites, belemnites, etc. of the rock systems, and the nautilus and cuttlefish of the present era. Their descent is probably from the carnivorous families of the pteropoda; for \" the nucleus of their shells,\" says the naturalist last quoted, \" is a spiral univalve, similar in form to the undeveloped shells above alluded to [those of the embryo gasteropods] ; and it is yet to be seen whether all cephalopoda do not commence their existence under a spiral-shelled pteropod ous form.\" It has also been remarked, that \" the shells of two species [of pteropoda] afford indications of a transition towards the cephalo poda ; one resembling in its straight conical form the belemnite and many other extinct genera of"], [292, "278 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL that class, and the other having a partially formed chamber at the lower closed extremity ; and similar evidence is afforded by their- internal structure. \"(\") This genealogy, if it shall be affirmed, will afford an important illustration of the geological history, because it will show that cephalopoda might be expected to make their appear ance as early in the rock series as any other mollusks possessing parts equally fitted to commemorate their existence. These animals are to be supposed as an ultimate form, reached, not through the medium of all the lower molluscan orders, but only of one, and with respect to that one, it so happens that, though possessing hard parts of such delicacy as to have little chance of preserva tion, relics of it have been discovered as far down as any cephalopodous remains. (76) This contem poraneity of the cephalopoda with the gastero pods and brachiopods, it may be remarked, would be in harmony with what we know of the economy of nature with respect to the destructive animals. They seem to bear a relation to those upon which they are destined to prey, and to be a necessary accompaniment to them. Hence they would require to be upon a different genetic line \u2014 which actually appears, in every advance of the animal"], [293, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 279 kingdom, to be the case \u2014 and developed contem poraneously with the weaker tribes, the fertility of which would otherwise produce complete anarchy. Granting, then, this pedigree for the cephalopoda, it woidd be no anomaly in our theory7, although remains of inferior mollusks should never be found lower down in any part of the earth. The cephalopods, though so highly organized in comparison with the gasteropods, do not ad vance, like these, to land forms, with apparatus for aerial respiration. They are, as a class, re stricted to a pelagic life, admitting of occasional appearances on the surface of the ocean. Their respiratory system is accordingly branchiate, yet with marks of grade which are worthy7 of observa tion. It is, in the words of Professor Ow*en, a law determining animal rank, that \" increased number [of parts] irrespective of correlative struc ture, in an organ of the animal body, is ever a mark of its inferiority.\" By this test, the nautilus, with its four branchi\u00e6, sinks below the belemnite and the cuttle-fish with only two ; and such is the basis of a division of the cephalopoda. In the whole of this order, however, there is a re markable advance of the nervous system, though"], [294, "280 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL only to the effect of enabling the animal to supply itself with food by conquest over the inferior tribes. The nervous centres, whicii in lower mollusca were only protected by coverings which also served to cover the rest of the body, now be come of sufficient importance to have a special protection, in the form of cartilaginous plates, which naturalists interpret as the rudiment of an internal skeleton. In this way, the cephalopoda approach the borders of the vertebrate sub kingdom. This remarkable class of animals affords in its details some evidences in favour of the develop ment theory. The humble form of a straight or slightly curved shell prevails in the earlier ages. Curved shells increase afterwards. There are also tolerably distinct appearances of a transition of forms in the genera of clymenia, goniatite, and ceratite, which make their appearance in this succession in the rock formations. The di branchiate belemnites commence in the oolitic epoch, ushering in the sepi\u00e6, the highest of all the cephalopodous orders, and which have since continued to exist. It is worthy of remark that, in the succession of rocks, the forms of the cephalopoda change"], [295, "281 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. much more abruptly than appears to be the case with other less organized mollusca ; that is, there are more decided as well as more frequent examples of what geo logists call change of species in this class than in others. This is only7 one of the many proofs of law in these phenomena. On the theory of interferences, why should there be entire renewals of some sets of animals and not of others ? On the theory of law, we only see each line of organic being undergoing the modifica tions appropriate to its special constitution, in connexion with the efficacy upon that constitution of external conditions.

The annexed tabular view will make this readily and abundantly plain. Those animals which, though hypothetically con cerned in the genealogy, are not actually found in a fossil state, but for whose non-appearance as fossils reasons are given, are expressed in italics. In looking among the animals of one class for the point of connexion by which it is joined to the next above, we must not invariably expect to find what we are wanting in the highest species, for these are often the heads of branches. On the contrary, it appears, in many instances, in the lower species. And this is the more worthy of being pointed out, as the supposition of some thing different has supplied one of the stum bling blocks of the development theory. In all the classes, for instance, which have terrestrial as well as marine species, the nexus to the next grade of being is among the latter, which are in variably the inferior. And thus it is that no tran sition of the kind here under our attention \u2014 that is, none of the greater grade transitions \u2014 takes place out of the aquatic medium which I have regarded as analogous to that of all individual embryos."], [297, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 283 We now proceed into the Vertebrata, of which the fishes compose the lowest class. Here, with a skeleton, we have red blood and a double chambered heart ; but the blood is still cold, and tbe respiratory system is by branchi\u00e6, the ani mals being wholly designed for aquatic existence. Of the transitions or transmutations implied by the development theory, the greatest, or most violent, are those few which took place in the passage from the invertebrate animals to fishes, from fishes to reptiles, and from these to the higher classes. This we might expect, as at such points the phenomenon had nothing to do with external circumstances, but wholly depended on the internal development force, \u2014 each stage being one of that limited number of periods, into which the long enduring gestation of nature was divided. Here, accordingly, we shall always find the affinities less distinct than elsewhere ; and yet at all of them some connexions are visible, leaving the general fact of the transition indu bitable. Between the invertebrate animals and the fishes, the junction is tolerably clear at one point. This is where the cephalopodous mollusks con nect with such fishes as the myxine, or hag, and"], [298, "284 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL the lamprey. These fishes are worm-like in shape, with only a rudimental skeleton in the form of a homy or gelatinous cord. They have a suctorial leech-like mouth, with numerous small teeth, by which they fasten upon living animals for sustenance. The affinity to the cephalopods is fully admitted. It is seen in the nature of the skeleton, so like that of the belemnite, in the character of the investing skin which ejects a copious secretion whenever the animal considers itself in clanger, in the power of respiring through the gill apertures without any dependence for that function on the mouth, and in the eight free filaments seen in some species extending forward from around the mouth, \u2014 \" representing,\" as Pro fessor Owen remarks, \" the eight ordinary7 arms of the Cephalopoda Dibranchiata, but arrested in their development by reason of the prepon derating size of the caudal extremity of the body, which now [that is, in the fish] forms the sole organ of locomotion.\" The lancelot, one of this family, is so extremely humble in organization, that Pallas mistook it for a limax (a gasteropodous mollusk), and it has only of late been finally established among the fishes. Some difficulty has been experienced in seeing true affinity be-"], [299, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 285 tween the bag-like figure of the mollusk and the cylindrical elongated form of the fish ; but it has been suggested that the mollusk is, as it were, the fish doubled in or inverted upon itself: hence the end of the alimentary canal so near to the mouth. The inversion reversed or undone, makes the fish. These appearances of propinquity are most arresting. If they7 do not indicate genealo gical connexion, how should we account for them ? On any other supposition, how should such peculiarities of organization be seen exactly at this point in the animal scale ? The fishes here spoken of are not discovered in a fossil state. For this their want of hard parts unfitted them ; but they are classed with the Chondrop tergii, or cartilaginous fishes, which, we have seen, are amongst the first found in the ascending series of rocks. The affinity and the geological succession, are therefore in perfect harmony. It is here important to remark the progress from entirely soft animals, to an order bearing cartila ginous plates to protect a rudimental brain; from these, again, to an order having a skull and ver tebral column of cartilage; a series of advances entirely conformable to phenomena seen in indi vidual development. Nor is it to be overlooked"], [300, "286 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL that the presumed progeny exhibit, in their vora cious character, ancl the functions they serve in nature, a perfect family likeness to their ancestry. Thc cartilaginous fishes were the chief police for keeping down the redundant life of the Devonian and Carboniferous seas, as the cephalopoda had been during the Lower and partly also during the Upper Silurian eras. The approach made by7 the annelides to some of the humbler forms of sish indicates another passage from the invertebrate into the vertebrate animals ; and this passage may have taken place in the Upper Silurian or Devonian era, for anne lides are ascertained to have previously existed. Perhaps some of the less destructive of the early cartilagines \u2014 the Lepidoids were such an inoffen sive family \u2014 have had such an origin. It might be suggested, as an inquiry worthy of the attention of zoologists, whether the echino dermal line has not given rise to the more re cently developed fish families, \u2014 those which enter upon the field in the cretaceous era.

The geological history of the animals in question is favourable to the conjecture, for the echinoderms are amongst the most conspicuous and important forms antecedent to the chalk era. Looking, in deed, at the enormous abundance of crinoidea in the carboniferous rocks, one can hardly avoid the idea that this peculiar form was destined for some important ultimate history. It might be suggested that the orders by which the fish class is thus entered are those placed by Cuvier at the bottom of the osseous fishes, the Lophobranchii and Plec tognathi, which indicate their nearness to the in vertebrate type by many features attaching to some or all of them, as imperfection ancl slow hardening of the skeleton, deficiency of ribs and fins, low and embryotic forms of mouth, dentition, and gills ; the Lophobranchi, moreover, hatching their young in a pouch below the tail, after the manner of a family of animals equally low in the mammalia. In the present state of this inquiry, it is impos sible to give an entire genealogical tree of Being. Much must remain obscure and unindicated. Even of what is set forth, some parts must be"], [302, "288 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL held liable to correction under better light. Enough, however, is done for the present object, if such fragments of the great composite chain be shown, as afford proof that there is such a thing in nature, and that the idea of genetic succession of advancing forms is in harmony7 with it. In the Fishes, we have one of the obscurer portions of the animal kingdom. The classifications of Cuvier ancl Agassiz are neither of them admitted to be natural; it is therefore not to be expected that any general student should be able to dis- play the class in all its genetic relations, however confident he may be, from what he sees else- where, that such relations exist. We sind, how- ever, three advances made to its lower confines from the invertebrata \u2014 namely, by the cephalo- podous mollusks, by the annulose animals (anne lides), and by the echinodermata. And we see advances made in its upper confines to the next higher class, the Reptilia, which succeed it in the strata and chronology of the earth, as in or ganization. It is also sufficiently clear, that the succession of fishes upon our globe was in conformity with the embryonic development of the individual fish of a high order. This has been denied; but"], [303, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 289 against all inferior authorities that of M. Agassiz must on such a point be held incontestable. He expressly affirms it as proved \" that the embryo of a fish during its development, the class of living fishes in its numerous families, and the fish type in its planetary history, in every respect go through analo gous phases.\" The want of substantial vetebr\u00e6 in the Devonian fishes is found in the last gradation of the class of fishes, among the Cyclostomes. He has reason to think that the internal case for the brain in the Devonian fishes was cartilaginous. So it is in the sturgeon, so it is in all embryos. Certain arrangements of the fins, as well as the heterocercal tail, and the inferior position of the mouth, complete these curious and most convinc ing analogies. The Reptiles to the cold blood of the fish add a higher circulatory organization, as also lungs for aerial respiration ; all of them (for exceptions are only7 apparent) are oviparous. Amidst the confusions of existing classifications, it is pos sible to trace three leading divisions, of which the tortoise, the lizard, and the frog are the seve ral representatives, \u2014 namely, the Chelonia, the Sauria, and the Batrachia. Cuvier makes a fourth order of the serpents ; but Merrem and o"], [304, "290 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL other naturalists have shown, I think successfully, that these are but a reduction from the lacertine portion of the sauria. The Chelonia are remarkable for the box-like case in which most of them are inclosed, \u2014 a pe culiar development of the ribs of the animal, and which forms an admirable means of passive de fence. They are animals of inert faculties, but great tenacity of life, and, generally speaking, the most harmless of all the reptiles, many of them feeding exclusively on vegetable substances. Destitute of teeth, they exhibit, like the birds, only a horny armature of the jaws, and even this is, in one genus, replaced by skin only. The Chelonia are for the most part tropical animals, being seldom seen beyond the 20th de gree of latitude. Within that range, however, the marine species are remarkable for the long voyages they annually undertake, for the purpose of depositing their eggs. It is also found, from our stony records, that the Chelonia were much more widely diffused over the earth in the ages of the oolite and tertiary than they are now. The marine chelonia\u2014 Turtles (Chelones) \u2014 de mand the first notice. In this group we find the largest existing specimens of the order ; some of them reach six and even seven feet in length, and"], [305, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 291 weigh seven or eight hundred pounds. All of them have extremities modified into paddles, for marine progression, with the toes enveloped in the membrane, and a very slight development of claws ; but there is a natural division of the che- lones in respect of habits and even of organiza- tion. One sub-group, amongst which is the common Green Turtle, so well known for its pala- table qualities, is composed of species altogether herbivorous and of gregarious and innocent habits. These animals may be seen in herds at the bottom of the sea, quietly browsing on the weeds growing there. Sometimes they enter the mouths of large rivers, and are occasionally seen to make their way ashore, apparently in search of food. Their plates are discoidal, laid edge towards edge, with intervals of cartilage, by which their bodies have a certain flexibility. Another sub-group comprises turtles of carnivorous habits, active, and when attacked, fierce ; examples are seen in the Loggerhead Turtle, which has the plates arranged as above, and the Hawksbill, in which they are imbricated, or laid edge over edge ; the latter being the animal which furnishes the arts with the elegant substance called Tor- toise-shell. Finally, there is a genus, also of o 2"], [306, "292 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL carnivorous habits, \u2014 the Sphargis or Coriaceous Turtle, \u2014 in which the exterior is not composed of shell, but of a leathery skin, having seven tuber culated ridges passing lengthwise along the back. These carnivorous genera have a more powerful form of mouth than the rest, and in some the claws are more marked. Thus armed, the Log gerhead, for example, will defend itself from a man with courage ancl ferocity, will snap a walk ing cane in twain with one effort of its jaws, and not let go anything it has seized until its own life is extinct. These genera live upon mollusca, Crustacea, and fishes ; and even the young croco diles are liable to the attacks of the loggerhead. The progression of all the turtles in their proper element is rapid. M. Audubon says \u2014 \"The Green and Hawkbilled, in particular, remind you by their celerity, and the ease of their motions, of the progress of a bird in the air.\" In all the remaining chelonia, the paddle form of the extremities is exchanged for legs and feet, the latter furnished with claws. The River Tortoises (Tryonices), conspicuous tenants of the Ganges and Euphrates, the Niger and Nile, the Mississippi and Ohio, are next in size to the Turtles, some being three feet long."], [307, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 293 With an imperfect development of the osseous case, they are enveloped in a soft skin, which has caused them to be often denominated Soft Tor toises. The feet are palmated for swimming, and the toes exhibit three claws. These animals are of fierce and energetic character, living upon fishes and reptiles, and not scrupling to attack the young alligators. They dart out their head at their prey with inconceivable rapidity, ancl tear it with their sharp-edged beaks and claws, after the manner of the predaceous birds. The Emydes, sometimes called Fresh-water Tortoises, sometimes Marsh Tortoises, are of many various species, haunting lakes, marshes, and small rivers in Asia, Africa, Australia, but more particularly America, where the proper habitat is most largely presented. They have shelly cases, which in youth exhibit the imperfect closing peculiar to the turtles, but afterwards be come complete. Certain species can, by flexures in the case, close in their head, tails, and feet, so as to set enemies at defiance. The feet are pal mated, and provided with five claws before and four behind. A remarkable rapidity of movement distinguishes this family, which devours not only aquatic worms, insects, mollusks, and small rep-"], [308, "294 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL tiles, but carrion. Among the emydes are species, such as Cestudo Carolina and Emys Muhlen burgii, which tend to a land life, ancl have the feet less palmated than the rest. There are also genera, Pyxis and Kinyxis, the one belonging to the Old World, the other to the New, which are regarded as connecting links between the emydes and land tortoises. Several aquatic genera of remarkable forms are not yet settled in any definite place in our systems. One of these, the Emysaura Serpentina, whicii has a large head and a crocodilian tail, lives in the North American rivers, feeding on fish and small birds. Another, Chelys Fimbriata, or Ma tamata, with hardly- any tail, has a large neck and snouted head, in which the mouth opens cross wise ; it belongs exclusively to the rivers of Guiana. Mr. Swainson makes of these genera a group, to which he gives the name of Chelydrida. Last are the Land Tortoises (Testudines), in which, with a perfect osseous case, there are ex tremities formed entirely for land progression, terminating in rounded callous stumps, with in distinct unguicidate toes. These animals are found in tropical regions all over the earth. Generally they are of small size ; but in the Gala-"], [309, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 295 pagos islands Mr. Darwin found them several feet in length, and we know that in the tertiary era there were species in India of colossal pro portions. The greater number of the land tor toises are vegetable feeders, and similar in dispo sition to the herbivorous turtles. A small group of species, already adverted to, stand apart, as exhibiting immediate affinities to the emydes. Seeing the various characters of the Chelonia, and keeping in view the principles of the genea logical system, we have good reason for believing that two or more stirpes exist in this order of animals. The herbivorous species of sea and land undoubtedly form portions of one family, the transition from the one to the other being attended by little besides a slight conversion of the extremities, a maturing of the development of the osseous case, and that reduction of bulk which is everywhere seen in terrestrial advances from marine originals. Another stirps, perhaps starting in the coriaceous turtle, involves the Try onices, or Soft Tortoises, which may be regarded as having merely passed from a marine to a fluvia tile life, as has been done in many other instances. The Emydes, for which an original may be found in some of the other carnivorous turtles, consti-"], [310, "296 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL tute another line terminating in certain land species. On the chelydes it would perhaps be premature to speculate. In our investigations in this order, it is highly instructive to mark the improvement in the filling up of the interstices of the osseous frame as we advance from the marine and fluviatile species. These interstices are seen in the youth of the emydes and land tortoises, but as age advances, they are obliterated. But what is in them a youthful and transient cha racter, is permanent in the former animals, mark ing clearly their precedence in the genealogical scale. No better word than Sauria seems attainable for the greatly varied order which next occurs, a combination of all the loricate and squamate reptiles. The crocodile, the lizard, and serpent, will suggest tbe principal forms to those least acquainted with zoology. They are extensively distributed over the earth, but chiefly in warm climates, and, being for the most part disliked by man, they are usually seen to decline as the human population advances. Of the three great rep tilian orders, they may be considered the most carnivorous and destructive, though few are of great strength. In the time of the secondary"], [311, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 297 formation, it was different. Vast saurians then traversed both sea and land, the undoubted masters of the animal world. Now, excepting in the cro codile family, and a few of the serpents, bulk and strength have alike departed from the order. The Crocodilia form a distinct and well marked family, comprehending the several genera of the common Crocodile, distributed in Africa, India, and America, the Alligators and Caimans of North America, and the Gavial, peculiar to India. All of these are well known to be animals of large size, living in rivers, fierce and carnivorous, and serving a useful end in devouring the dead animals which are usually floated in great quantities down the large continental streams. Their exterior presents \" distinct series of bones of moderate size, embedded, as it were, in the substance of the skin, and covered externally with a thick cuticle ;\" hence the term loricata, or mailed, which has been applied to them. The head is large, with an enormous gape, and some arrangements in respect of teeth, nostrils, and gullet, w*hich appear admirably adapted for an animal requiring to catch its prey in the water. The origin of this reptdian family is to be sought amongst the great aquatic saurians of the secondary formation ; the o3"], [312, "298 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL ichthyosaur, in particular, whose head is entirely crocodilian, while its general organization is sish like. Afterwards, connecting links occur in the teleosaur, steneosaur, &c. The remainder of the sauria present various forms tolerably distinguished from each other, but which are usually comprehended under the general term lacertine, the lizard being regarded as their type. First, and nearest to the crocodiles, may be cited the Varanid\u0153, a group composed of the Ouran or varan of the Nile, the Monitors of both worlds, the tupinambis, and other genera ; animals living upon small reptiles and insects, chiefly frequenting land, but also occasionally haunting the banks of rivers. The varan is so like the crocodile, and makes such an approach to itin bulk, that the Egyptians believe it to spring from an egg of that animal which has been hatched in dry earth. The skin of the varanians is \" fur nished with enchased scales, which are tuber culous, projecting, rounded upon the head as well as upon the back and sides, always distributed in rings or circular bands, parallel under the belly and round the tail.\" The teeth are planted in a furrow, and curve backward. Next may be men tioned the Lacertid\u00e6, or True Lizards, of which"], [313, "299 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. the only living examples are small insect-eating animals, in a great variety of specific forms, scattered over the warm and temperate countries ofthe Old World; the least repulsive of all reptiles, often indeed of beautiful form and colouring. In intimate alliance with them may be placed the Geckos, which are of nocturnal habits, and the Chameleons, which again are inhabitants of trees, all of these being likewise insectivorous. In pal\u00e6 ontology, the lacertian animals date from an earlier time than any other Sauria. The huge extinct Monitors of the Thuringian Zechstein, the thecodonts of the nearly contemporary dolo mitic conglomerate of Redland near Bristol, were the patriarchs of these families, and are the earliest fossil reptiles certainly known to us. The Mosasaurus, the Geosaurus, and the Megalo saurus, were likewise huge early specimens of this division of the sauria. Finally7, we have the Iguanid\u0153, the most harmless of all the Sauria, being generally restricted to a vegetable diet ; likewise small animals in our time, but exem plified at a former period in the enormous igua nodon of the Wealden. To this family belong the anolis, stellio, dragons, basilisks, and other species."], [314, "300 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL The serpents (Ophidia) are usually placed as a distinct order of reptiles ; such was the arrange ment of Cuvier : but Merrem and several other modern naturalists of high character, place them in connexion with the squamate sauria ; and there, undoubtedly, natural classification requires that they should be. From those sauria to the ophidia, there is such a series of transitional forms in the scinks and chalcid\u00e6, where we see the body gradually becoming elongated and more serpentiform, and the limbs diminishing away to mere rudiments, that it is impossible to assign exact limits to the various genera. We may even see in the perfect varanians a preparation for this new form. In these animals, the bones of the head have, in part, that looseness of structure and adherence which is carried to so remarkable an extent in the serpents, which, being obliged to take their prey entire, could not otherwise swallow it. The varanians, too, move in a serpentine manner, using their long tail to aid their progres sion, and to enable them the better to leap upon their prey; peculiarities in which they greatly resemble the serpents. In the last lacertilia, the ribs are increased in number, the two pairs of limbs are removed farther and farther from each"], [315, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 301 other, and become small and weak ; in some species the anterior, and in others the posterior pair, alone remain; until at last they are re duced to mere rudiments which do not appear above the skin. The common slow-worm is an example of a lacertilian in this state. At the same time, to suit the necessities of a body con siderably attenuated, one of the lungs is gradually shrunk up, until at length, in the true serpent, only7 a vestige of it remains. Such is the actual history of the great serpent families \u2014 reductions from tbe lacertilia, to suit a life generally skulk ing and furtive ; and there could not well be a more lively illustration of the doctrine of the transformation of animals It furnishes a strong proof of the readiness of nature to go back as well as to go forward, according as circumstances shall dictate. It shows how futile is tbe objection to the development theory, from such facts as the crocodile-like arrangement of teeth in the theco dont lizards, the fathers of this order; an advance of grade being a saltus which may give such a superiority to the patriarchs of a series, while it depends on the accident of external conditions whether this is to be improved upon, maintained, or degraded. Many existing serpents are much"], [316, "302 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL larger than any existing lacertilia, the parent family ; but it must be remembered that the early lizards were of enormous bulk. How perfectly does pal\u00e6ontology harmonize with this view of the genesis of the ophidia! no fossil serpent occurring in that secondary formation, where all the other reptilian forms so greatly abounded. Such harmonies may always be expected where the true track of natural investigation has been arrived at. A naked moist skin, sometimes smooth, some times covered with papill\u00e6 or tubercles, is the only universal character of the third division of the Reptiles \u2014 the Batrachia, so called from the Greek word for a frog, as that animal is the most conspicuous example of the order. The animals of this order are also remarkable for coming into active existence in a fish form (the tadpole), and passing in the course of active life through one of those metamorphoses which in other animals are undergone before birth. They realize, as has been said, before our eyes, one of the grade tran sitions presumed by the development theory. In some species, however, certain portions of the organization are arrested at the fish stage, and so continue through life."], [317, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 303 The frogs and toads (Ranid\u0153) are the batra chians most universally diffused over the earth and most familiarly known. They are harmless creatures, generally of small size, living upon slugs and insects, which they catch by darting out their long soft tongue, the end of which is, for this purpose, covered with a viscid fluid. They* hibernate in mud or water, thus living a long time, not only7 without food, but without aerial respiration, a proof of the low organic character of these animals. The frogs spend much of their time in water; some assume a partially arboreal life, and have certain peculiarities in the feet which assist them in climbing. The toads are more terrestrial in their habits; but all alike have to propagate in the water, where their shell-less eggs are deposited in long strings, a single mother producing urjwards of a thousand young. Some foreign species of the ranid\u00e6 greatly exceed ours in size ; but, in comparison with the two other reptilian orders, the batrachian may be said to consist of little animals. Teeth are wanting in most of the toads, and they are developed on a humble scale in the frogs. The whole of the ranid\u00e6 are destitute of tail ; neither have their toes any armature, excepting a horny sheath in a"], [318, "304 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL few species. They are also devoid of ribs, or present at the most rudiments of such bones. The ungainly form of the toad has oaused it to be no favourite with our race, and given rise to many reports against it, particularly one respect ing its venomous qualities, which is quite false. A French naturalist remarks that, if we could behold the frog without prejudice, we should see in it an animal uniting an elegant form with light and slender limbs, adorning the banks of the rivulet with its pleasing colours (only less vari able in some species than those of the chameleon), and animating the scene with its light and lively gambols. The croaking noise of the frog is pro verbial ; this is changed in the love season to a soft ancl plaintive note. A modern writer says, \" A traveller towards the desert shores of the Caspian and the Volga would imagine that he heard of a sudden, in the evening, a joyous assembly of men and women laughing very heartily. He approaches ; tbe inextinguishable laughter redoubles among the rocks, and, to his astonishment, he finds that it proceeds from an assembly of enormous black toads, celebrating their nuptial rites. (\") Although the frogs and toads are now, gene-"], [319, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 305 rally speaking, small animals, we must recollect that such has not always been the case. The Labyrinthodon of the Warwick Sandstone, an animal allied to the frog, is believed to have been as large as a good-sized hog. It may at the same time be remarked that, if this was the utmost size attained by batrachia in the era of the secondary formation, they were then, as now, relatively much smaller than the saurian order, of which several reached the length of thirty, forty, and even, it is believed, seventy feet. A second division of batrachia is composed of animals of which the salamander is the type ; hence called Salamandrid\u0153. In them, the tail is largely developed : in other respects, as in their reproductive history*, they resemble the preceding division, the water newts being analogous to the frogs, and the land salamanders to the toads. They also resemble the ranid\u00e6 in habits; but one remarkable species, the Menopoma of the Ohio and Alleghany rivers, which reaches two feet in length, is more fierce and carnivorous than any of the frogs or toads. The salamandrid\u00e6 are exten sively diffused over the earth ; they generally are small animals, but one species, Sieboltia, which inhabits a lake upon a basaltic mountain in Japan,"], [320, "306 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL is three feet in length, and fossil species are found in the schists of Q^ningen (miocene forma tion), which must have been of nearly twice this measurement. The fluid which exudes from the salamanders, as from other batrachia, is probably what has given rise to the vulgar notion that these animals can resist the action of fire. The remaining batrachia are isolated species, generally limited in locality, and all of them retain in their maturity some portion of the fish character. The Amphiuma, an eel-like animal, two or three feet long, which is found in stagnant pools in the more southern of the United States, has apertures in the sides of the neck, the last vestige of the gill structure. Deep underground, in waters never visited by daylight, resides the blind Proteus, which continues to have entire gills branching from the neck throughout the whole of life, and only depends in a less degree upon lungs. With four short and feeble limbs, it departs little from the form of the fish. The Sirens, which inhabit marshes in Carolina, have no hind limbs, and only rudiments of the anterior pair. In the North American lakes is the Meno branchus, with constant gills, and four very small limbs : it sometimes attains the length of three"], [321, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 307 feet. Another of these gilled batrachia is the Axolotl of the Mexican lakes, the flesh of which is esteemed a delicacy. The reduction of limbs in some of these latter species reminds us of the lacertilian animals on the approach of that family to the serpent form. It is not therefore surprising to learn that there is a genus of undoubted batracbians which are wholly serpentine in figure, that is, without limbs, and also possessed, like the serpents, of unequal lungs. These are the Cecilia, or blind-worm, and kindred species, all of them inhabitants of warm countries ; usually of a very attenuated form, and about two feet long. Till lately, the cecilia was ranked with serpents ; but its passing through a metamorphosis, united to a considera tion of its naked skin, has at length assigned it to the present order. Vegetable matters, as well as mud and sand, have been found in the stomachs of the ceciliad\u00e6. The batrachia have a particular value on the present occasion, as, although probably but the relics of an order once containing many more genera, and some of these much larger in bulk, they present unequivocal affinities to the grade below them, and also striking affinities amongst"], [322, "308 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL themselves, while their reproduction supplies a faithful picture of the principal phenomenon con cerned in the development theory. Several genera, by retaining portions of the fish cha racter, make the descent of the whole from fishes still more apparent. Professor Owen has shown that not merely in the retention of gill, but in peculiarities of teeth, can the nearness of some of the batrachia to fishes be distinguished. The Ranid\u00e6 appear to compose two kindred lines ; the toads, in their more terrestrial habits, may be said to make a greater advance than the frogs. In the Salamandrid\u00e6, there are also traces of at least two lines: amongst them, from smooth skins and aquatic habits, to tuberculated skins and land habits, we pass through a well-knit chain of affinities. In the other Batrachia, we see only detached developments from the neighbouring fish form, which we may suppose, in some in stances at least, to have been prevented from advancing into new forms by the circumstances in which they are placed. With this account of the Reptiles, the geolo gical history of the class, as far as it goes, ap pears in harmony. First, it is after fish that reptiles occur in time, as it is after fish that they"], [323, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 309 stand in organization. Early in the Carbonige nous era, after fishes had existed for the space of an entire formation, there arises a family assum ing a trace of reptilian character, in an inner row of Saurian teeth. The Sauroid fishes, as they are called, increase and multiply, and, several ages thereafter, \u2014 in the Muschelkalk, \u2014 the Enalio sauiia, or fish-crocodiles (ichthyosaur, etc.), are presented, in which the passage to the reptile is clear and distinct. Before this event in the saurian line, a similar and more effectual transi tion had taken place in at least two other animal series, resulting in those specimens of the lacerti lian order which are found in the Keuper, and those batrachians upon which Mr. Owen has con ferred the name of Labyrinthodon. In these instances, our records are meagre, and it is there fore not surprising that specimens uniting the fish with the reptile, as is done by the enaliosauria, are not as yet found. But still the general affinity to the fish character, as well as a certain degree of aquatic habit, is shown in the biconcave verte br\u00e6 of these early lizards and frogs. Of what has been remarked as to the late occurrence of ser pents, it is not necessary to make repetition. The next class above the Reptiles is that of"], [324, "310 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL Birds, in which warm blood makes its first ap pearance, ancl which are marked by various other traits of superiority, particularly in the nervous sy-stein, though an oviparous mode of reproduc tion is still maintained. It is a class compre hending a vast number of families, adapted to different spheres of existence and habits ; some predaceous and sanguinary, others innocent and supported by a vegetable diet ; some adapted for living upon the water, others upon the land ; some designed to dwell upon the ground, others upon trees ; yet exhibiting, throughout the whole, ancl under every variety of external adaptation, a much greater unity of structure than any other class of equal importance. Unusually clear chains of affinity run through the class, one genus melt ing into another by the nicest shadings ; and yet, from the unfortunate principle of classification assumed by naturalists \u2014 in which the most ex ternal characters are taken as tbe chief basis of arrangement \u2014 there is no class presented to us in a more confused manner. A true classification of the Birds exhibits them in the order of succession which they have ob served in coming into existence, according to the general principle explained in this work."], [325, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 311 The first true division of the Birds is into three stirpes ; one whose food consists chiefly of vege table matters ; another which live wholly upon flesh ; a third who, as compared with either of the preceding, may be said to be omnivorous. The starting point with all three is in the Swimming Birds (Natatores of Cuvier) , where the organiza tion is admittedly the humblest, and to which an approximation from the Turtles has long been acknowledged. In this order, as it is called by Cuvier, there are some genera which present the typical bird form in a strikingly imperfect manner, the feet being placed so far behind the centre of gravity7 that the animal walks no better than a seal, while the anterior extremities \u2014 short, and, in some instances, scaled, rather than feathered \u2014 do not serve for flight, but are used exactly like the paddles of the marine turtles in propelling the body through the water; often for several hundred yards under it. It unexpectedly appears probable that the Birds are derived solely from this order of the Reptiles, and that this is the cause of their more concentrated unity of structure. The affinity to that inferior class is certainly7 less clearly shown than are the affinities which pervade the class itself; but can we be sure that the tran-"], [326, "312 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL sition from class to class was always to give intermediate forms, or that these, if given, were necessarily to be preserved, either as living species or as fossils ? The Chelonia present a sufficient variety of characters to have been the sole parent age of the Bird class ; many being fierce and carnivorous, while others are vegetable feeders and of gentle character. They are now chiefly tropical, while the swimming birds are hyperbo real; but the secondary and tertiary formations show that the chelonia were once much more widely distributed than they now are. The first of the great stirpes is that which gives us the birds most important of all to us \u2014 the do mestic poultry. Its root is in certain of the natatorial families, the Divers (Colymbid\u0153), Grebes, &c. These are Swimmers native to the Arctic Ocean, though accustomed to migrate southward in winter. They are immediately fol lowed by the Mergansers, Ducks, Geese, Swans (Anatid\u0153), and the Phalleropes (Phalleropid\u0153) , Gallinules, and Coots (Lobipedid\u00e6) , which still preserve the aquatic habits, and the webbed or lobated feet necessary for progression in the water, but tend more to residence in rivers and other inland waters. In these, however, we see"], [327, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 313 a clear separation into three subdivisions, one composed of the Mergansers and Ducks, which live in great part upon animal matters, another comprising the Geese and Swans, which are purely vegetable feeders, and a third embracing the Gallinules and Coots, whose diet is mixed. The tendency of these animals, in consequence of their tastes in aliment, was to advance along rivers and the shores of lakes, to those adjacent low grounds where vegetable food, worms, and insects, are to be found. They landed, we may say, either upon sandy beaches or upon those low shores which, in the early ages of the world, an tecedent to a time of cultivation, were wholly covered with marshes. On came the tide of popu lation behind ; it behoves them to spread land ward for subsistence. The consequence was a modification of the hitherto natatorial forms of these birds to suit a strolling life upon soft sands and in marshes. The webbing of the toes shrunk, being no longer required for swimming ; the toes were elongated, so as to give support upon a yielding ground or bottom ; the tarsi were also lengthened, to raise the body of the bird above the shallow water in which it walked : at the same time, the animal acquired a greater P"], [328, "314 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL length of neck and of bill to enable it to feed in these waters. Behold then the Wading Birds ( Grallatores of Cuvier) ; merely a transformation of their swimming progenitors ! In some parts of the earth, however, the regions adjacent to the sea were not marshes, but extensive sandy plains, presenting means of subsistence some what scantier, but still not to be overlooked. The consequence was a branch of the swimmers, adapted by length and strength of limbs for that rapid progression from one place to another which is required by animals placed on exten sive wastes. This branch comprises the Running Birds (Cursores), the Ostrich in Africa, the Emeu and Cassowary of Australia, the Rhea of Ame rica, the Apterix of New Zealand ; characterized by an extinction of the hind toe, which is not needed in their field of existence, and a reduc tion of the wings for the same reason in a modified degree, with, however, an approxima tion to mammalian characters, in the hair-like appearance of the feathers, the presence of a diaphragm in the viscera, and other structural minuti\u00e6. The three subdivisions are with tolerable dis tinctness seen passing each into its several progeny"], [329, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 315 among the waders. Looking at once to external features, and to habits and characters, we readily select, as the descendants of the anatine birds, the Ardeid\u0153 (Herons, Spoonbills, and Storks), the most brilliantly plumaged of the Waders, as the Ducks are of the Swimmers, and equally addicted to a foul kind of animal diet, being, as is well known, amongst the most active scavengers of eastern and other cities. The anserine birds claim a progeny in the Gruid\u0153 (Cranes), whose form of head, and the position of the eye, as well as the elevation of the hind toe upon the leg, remind us of that family, while their constancy to a pure vegetable diet is equally conspicuous. The Phalleropes, Gallinules, and Coots, reappear in a variety of forms, possibly forming inferior divisions or branches, yet evi dently all much allied, the Rallid\u0153 (Rails), Otid\u0153 (Bustards), partially cursorial in figure, the Cha radriad\u0153 (Plovers), and the Scolopacid\u0153 (Snipes, Sandpipers, and Curlews). All of these birds are mixed feeders, of gentle and timid character, with a tendency to walking power, which in some instances enables the animal to escape more surely by threading the brake than by flight. This last property may be connected in some p 2"], [330, "316 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL way with the form of the feet shown by the grebes, phalleropes, rails, and other genera of the subdivision, these being not webbed, like those of the other swimming birds, but lobated ; that is, having a separate lobe expanded along the sides of each toe. The origin of all the bird life as yet spoken of, was that ocean which we now see beating the northern shores of the two great continents. There is the nativity of all these Swimmers ; there do they yet live in sea and air darkening abundance. Swimming birds, corresponding to them, scarcely exist anywhere in southern oceans ; there is but one development of anatine birds in that quarter, in the geese and cereopsis of Australia. The rise of wading descendants was the consequence of a spread inland; that is, harmonizing with that system of animal mi gration which the swimming birds are still seen practising. This movement of bird life soon over passed the borders of rivers, lakes, and marshes, and came to elevated, dry, and sylvan grounds ; and a necessity for other modifications then arose. At least two of the subdivisions under notice"], [331, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 317 had descendants suited to the new fields of exist ence. The cranes, spread as far south as India, there gave forth, as a great colony for its rich woods, the equally beautiful and useful Pheasant family (Phasianid\u0153), comprising the trained pea cock, the jungle-fowl, and common poultry ; in central America, in like manner, they presented the corresponding genera of turkeys and curras sows. Thus came those useful domestic birds, some of which have been our servants as long as man has had a history, and which have entered so much into our common associations and litera ture. From them, again, proceeded the Pigeons (Columbid\u0153) whose beauty and innocence are even more endearingly present to us. To those who see but the common fowl and the ordinary pigeon of our country, it may be difficult to sup pose such a connexion ; but in India, the native seat of the family7, the forms of the dove are numerous, and amongst them are species (for example, Geophilus Nicobarensis) which are evidently intermediate. The game birds, grouse, partridges, quails, &c. (Tetraonid\u0153) are descendants of the rails and bustards, appropriate to the heathy moorland"], [332, "318 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL and mountain. So ends the first great stirps of the class of Birds. Some general principles are clearly to be ob served in the genealogy. Each subdivision pre serves its own character, particularly as to food, through all the transformations which it under goes. Thus the anserine birds, the cranes, and the poultry* and pigeons, are all of them innocent vegetable-feeding animals. There is also an invariable diminution of size of body from the oceanic original to the inland descendants : for example, the anserine birds sink in the cranes, these fall off again in the poultry, and these again in the pigeons. At the same time, intelligence and the tendency to domesticity always increase. The Second great stirps is composed of birds destined by their organization and dispositions to act as destructives over the rest. Its chief subdivision commences in a swimming family (Procellarid\u0153), of which the huge Albatross, with its ten feet expanse of wings and its great hooked bill, is an example. The tendency of this family, as determined by the temptation of food, was not generally to low shores, but to cliffy wildernesses. Accordingly, it passed through no wading forms, unless the solitary species, the"], [333, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 319 Secretary of India and the Mauritius, be an ex ception. It passed at once into the majestic Eagle, the grandest of all birds, and a terrible image of unrelenting destructiveness. Some of the aquiline genus, as the Osprey, still haunt the shores and rivers, while others take up their abode in inland and generally Alpine grounds, frequenting the plains only for the sake of prey. The Kites and Buzzards show an affinity, as of descent, to the Eagles. Another subdivision presents, in suite, the Falcons (including hawks), and the Owls (Strigid\u0153), the latter being addicted to living near the haunts of men and pursuing prey by night. A link between the two is seen in the peregrine falcon, both in its owlish visage and its inclination to live in tall buildings. Another swimming family, composed of the Pelicans and Cormorants (Pelicanid\u00e6) , gives rise to the Vultures ; and thus is completed the rap torial stirps. The Third stirps is in some respects the most remarkable of all. It spreads out into a much greater variety of species than either of the other two ; it is diffused over every country of the globe. On the whole, it may be described as omnivorous, though some genera are exclusively"], [334, "320 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL flesh-eaters, and even distinguished by their pre daceous and sanguinary character. Hopping is a prevading, though not exclusive, mode of pro gression. The birds are generally, though not in every instance, remarkable for their wariness and vivacity ; some are noted for their chattering and imitative powers ; some of the most advanced genera attract attention by their beautiful song. The stirps starts with the Gulls (Larid\u0153), an oceanic tribe distributed over the whole world, of active flying habits, generally of pure white plumage, presenting a variety of species, some of which, as the Terns, tend to a river life, and are of a swallow-like form. The mental character of the gulls does not stand high in our estimate ; but we often do injustice in this respect to the sea-birds, believing that to be stupidity which is only unconsciousness of danger arising from the habitat being remote from human haunts. Mr. Edmondstone of Zetland speaks of the \" charac teristic inquisitiveness and vivacity\" of many of the gulls, being the very qualities to be ex pected in the patriarchs of this stirps. Certain species, as the Skua, are predaceous and fierce, and the Glaucous Gull is a well known attendant upon sailing vessels for the sake of offal. Like"], [335, "321 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. the crows, the gulls attack and devour : they will quickly eat up a dead whale. The common gull, again, comes to land in cultivated regions, and follows the plough in search of what it may turn up. It is not unworthy of notice, considering how this stirps is generally distinguished in re spect of voice, that a particular species of the Larid\u00e6 is known, from its peculiar cry, by the name of the Laughing Gull. Though the Gulls are upon the whole a whitish race, there are species presenting an admixture of black. This should prepare us in some degree to hear the crows (Corvid\u00e6), and Kingfishers (Haley onid\u00e6), presented as the immediate succes sors of the Gulls, more especially as one of the former family \u2014 the Pie \u2014 is chequered, and white crows sometimes occur as exceptions to the rule. But the immediate dependence of the colour of plumage upon conditions is one of the most familiar facts of the phdosophical naturalist, and the changes in this respect which individual birds undergo in their moultings before attaining ma turity, might well reconede us to the most start ling transitions. The Kingfishers \u2014 small birds of brilliant me tallic plumage \u2014 belong to the sea but extend P3"], [336, "322 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL into rivers. In their wide diffusion over the earth, in their habit of darting upon fish, and in their voice, which, in an Australian species, is a laugh, they show their title to the place assigned to them. To them we affiliate the Bee-eaters (Meropid\u0153), extensively diffused in the old world, and the Rollers. These birds are all fissirostral, a change of beak having taken place to sit them for catching the insects on which they feed. We now come to the well known, universally diffused Crows, the ancestors of by far the greater portion of the present stirps. Intelligent, wary, social, omnivorous, though some tend more to flesh-eating than others, this family is everywhere well marked ; everywhere are they an object of marvel and curious study to our species, to whom it almost appears as if their voices were a kind of speech. In the genealogy of animals, their place is extremely important, for to scarcely any has so vast and various a progeny been given. It clearly appears that various crows, the Raven, Rook, Jay, Pie, &e, are the heads of so many distinct families, which have assumed various sub-cha racters in different regions of the globe, according as they were affected by external conditions ; \" a mighty maze, but not without a plan.\""], [337, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 323 Taking the predaceous corvid\u00e6 first \u2014 they start in the Raven of the old world, and misnamed Black Vulture of America ; the largest of all the species ; animals keen-scented, cautious, yet fierce, and which do not scruple even to attack some of the larger mammalia. In our continent, we see the raven and carrion crow followed by the hooded crow, which, being only a reduced image of its predecessor, wdl without much difficulty pair with it, and produce a prolific offspring. The crows are classed by naturalists as Coni- rostres ; that is, having a conical beak. The beak is, nevertheless, considerably curved in the preda- ceous species, so as to approach the hooked form: in the American carrion crow it is as decidedly hooked as that of any raptorial bird. This should prepare us for hearing of series of birds descended from the predaceous crows, with that reduced kind of raptorial beak which, having a curve and a notch or tooth in the upper mandible, gives them in classification the name of Dentirostres. One of these genera is the Shrikes or Butcher Birds (Laniad\u0153), a numerous and widely-diffused assem blage, living upon the smaller birds and insects, the former of which, the shrike sticks, when killed, upon thorns, as a butcher hangs up meat"], [338, "324 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL in his stall ; hence the name of the genus. From the shrikes also proceed certain genera of emi nently insectivorous habits, and some of which, in accordance with that kind of prey, have the re duced form of beak called fissirostral, accom panied by a great width of gape \u2014 namely, the Swallows, Swifts, and Martins (Hirundinid\u0153) ; the Nightjars and Goatsuckers (Caprimulgid\u0153) , which, feeding by night, are to the swallows what the owls are to the falcons ; also the Fly-catchers (Muscicapid\u0153), a genus so near to the shrikes in aspect, that several of the species have been classed by various naturalists in that group. From the shrikes, moreover, if we can trust to an admitted affinity, come the Thrushes and Blackbirds (Merulid\u0153), whose fine song has blinded us in some degree to their destructive habits ; as also certain corresponding birds of other countries, the Breves of India and Aus tralia, the Water Owzel of Europe ; the Mocking Bird, Water Thrush, ancl Ant Thrush of America. The Lyre-birds of Australia are also in strong affinity to the thrushes. Here it may be re marked, that the blackbird, as well as the crow, occasionally produces a white offspring, thus re turning as it were to the primitive type."], [339, "325 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. The meruline family have an extensive progeny in the warblers (Sylviad\u00e6), nightingale, stone chat, blackcap, red-breast, redstart, &c, which are specially inhabitants of the groves and thickets, and devourers of insects. The affiliation here is peculiarly distinct : M. Vieillot remarks, \" a spotted warbler is to my eye nothing but a thrush in miniature.\" With the thrushes are also connected the wagtails (Motacillid\u0153) ; in the Ame rican water-thrush this affinity is exhibited very strongly. The Chough or Red-legged Crow (Fregilus), an omnivorous genus, of familiar habits, is, from the admitted affinity, the undoubted progenitor of the Starlings and Pastors (Sturnid\u0153), a famdy in favour with the human species on account of their intelligence, sprightliness, and fine song. \" They appear,\" says Mr. Swainson, \" as a smaller kind of crows, which they very much resemble in manners and structure.\" Allied to the starlings, and probably an offshoot from some local genus, are the Pique-b\u0153ufs (Bupkagid\u0153) of Africa, which give occasion to a remark of some importance in the present speculation. These birds derive their food from the parasite larv\u00e6 contained in the skins of ruminant animals, upon whose backs"], [340, "326 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL accordingly they take their meals, holding on by their cramp-iron-like feet, and using a forceps-like beak to squeeze out their food. The bird is fitted in a peculiar manner for this mode of existence ; its claws are the most hooked of all birds' claws, overlooking only the birds of prey. It is curious thus to find a bird fitted for a life in intimate con nexion with other animals, which we know did not come into existence till after the commence ment of birds. Upon the common theory, it would be necessary to believe that the pique-b\u0153uf was called into existence by a special fiat in con nexion with the greater phenomenon of the origin of ruminant animals. It almost looks like deri sion to ask if this be credible, especially when we consider that the pique-b\u0153uf is, in reality, not a bird standing in a solitary distinction of cha racters, but only a kind of starling adapted to special habits. Yet the reigning opinion of na turalists, if true to itself, can in no way escape from the absurdity to which this question reduces them. Near to the starlings, but perhaps only by col lateral relationship, is an important genus, nume rous in both Europe and North America, the Larks (Alaudid\u00e6), a ground-inhabiting, seed-"], [341, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 327 eating, innocent race, endeared to us by the habit so noted in certain species of rising high in the air, and there pouring out their beautiful and joyful songs. There are many varieties of the Lark, adapted to life upon shores, in fields, and amongst the woods. They possess a remarkably strong conical beak for husking seeds, and which they occasionally employ even in breaking nuts for the sake of the kernels. Perhaps with the larks should be associated the pipits or titlings. The Buntings (Ember izid\u0153), comprising the yel low hammer, ortolan, &e, are a comparatively untuneful variation from the larks, having a shorter bill with a palatal knob, but generally similar habits, insomuch that they are often caught in the same net. From them again come the Sparrows (Passeres), so widely diffused and so well known \u2014 as also the Finches (Fringillid\u0153), the latter an extensive genus of field bfrds, com prehending the goldfinch, chaffinch, linnet, canary, cross-bill, &c. The most conspicuous external feature of this series of birds is a hind claw of unusual length and straightness. All are coni rostral. The Cuckoo is from many features entitled to a place in or about this portion of the corvine"], [342, "328 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL stirps, though its zygodactyle foot has caused it to be classed by naturalists in their purely arti- ficial order of scansores or climbers. It is pre- valent over the old world, including Australia, and is everywhere noted for its habit of placing its eggs in the nests of other birds, that its young may be hatched and brought up by7 them. As is well known, the rearing of a young cuckoo in a nest costs the life of all the foster mother's own progeny. Here we have another difficulty of a remarkable kind for those who maintain that each species has been the result of a special fiat, for how irreconcileable is it with all our ideas of im- mediate or special arrangement that a particular species can only be continued by such a sacrifice. The fact is, that the cuckoo is obliged by its con- stitutional character to stay* an unusually short time in the northern regions where it produces its young. In our country7 its normal stay is only from the middle of April to the beginning of July. Belated in its approach to the nursing regions, it is obliged to make use of the nests of other birds, which it finds ready built. What is worthy of notice, it employs the nests of its own nearest relations, the larks, pipits, finches, spar rows, &e, an arrangement we may suppose to be"], [343, "329 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. connected in some way with the early history of the whole group of species \u2014 a famdy or clan sacrifice, as it were, for the benefit of a less for tunate member. Thus, it will be observed, when we take the whole group together, as only varia tions produced by certain natural laws from one stock, the parasitical reproduction of the cuckoo sinks into that character which alone we can re concile with the rest of the providential scheme, \u2014 a trivial exceptive evil in the midst of much that appears, and undoubtedly is, very good. The Jay* is said by Professor Macgillivray to connect the crows with the Tits (Parid\u00e6), a varied genus of notedly crow-like characters. From the Nutcracker, another of the smaller crows, come the Woodpeckers (Picid\u0153), which present merely a modification of the corvine structure to suit an insect-eating life amidst grow7 ing timber. The woodpeckers, for this purpose, have turned back the outer toe, so as to be able to climb and cling to the stems of trees ; the beak has been at the same time elongated, to enable them to search in the crevices of the timber for insects. They are spread into all the quarters of the globe. It is interesting to observe the kin dred nature of the parent species : the nutcracker"], [344, "330 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL is often observed to climb the bark of trees ; it uses the beak to split open nuts ; and, as in tbe woodpecker, the middle feathers of the tail have been found worn in consequence of their climbing habits. In near affinity to the woodpeckers, but perhaps only in cousinship, not in descent, we must place the Creepers (Certhiad\u0153), nut-hatch, hoopoe, wren, &c. ; smaller birds, which have the toes in the usual arrangement, but are not less dexterous in making their way along the bark of trees, and searching it for their favourite food. The Trogons of India, Africa, and America, and the kindred Todies, of the first of these countries and Jamaica, also appear to be of the wood pecker connexion. If we might judge by the structure of the tongue, we should place the Humming Birds of America in the same branch of the corvine genealogy : they eat insects, although certainly more peculiarly fitted to draw an innocent aliment from the juices of those flowers whose dyes they themselves rival. Cor responding to them in the Old World are the Honey-eaters of Australia and Sun-birds of India and Africa. Those remarkable looking birds, the Hornbills (Bucerid\u0153), natives of India and Africa, are another offshoot of the great corvine nest,"], [345, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 331 most probably from the Carrion crow, which, in feeding, those of Africa at least resemble. They are gregarious, noisy birds, generally of large size, with feet short for perching, their habit being to reside in trees. The tendency of the crow tribe to noise, or the exercise of voice, has led in this genus to a development which forms their most conspicuous feature, namely, a hollow protuberance, blown out, as it were, like a bag, upon the top of the upper mandible, and which serves as a sounding board to increase the vocife ration which the bird delights to utter. In imme diate descent from these birds are the Plantain eaters (Musophagid\u0153) , which, however, are re stricted to Africa. The Toucans of Tropical America (Ramphas tid\u0153) are another branch of the corvine family. They live in deep forests, much after the manner of the woodpeckers, using their enormous beaks and barbed tongues in searching out eggs and nestlings in the hollows of trees. Singular as the beak appears in this instance, it is seen to be expressly suited for the objects which the bird wishes to accomplish. Let us not wonder too much at a growth so extraordinary, or be too eager to set it down as a feature separating the"], [346, "332 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL bird hopelessly from all the rest of the corvine family. Naturalists daily see such modifications of this instrument, as make it very easy to under stand how the animal, tempted by food in pecu liar situations, came to have its beak adapted to the purpose of obtaining it. The same remark will serve on our introducing the Parrots (Psit tacid\u0153) as another family of the corvine stirps, some of whose special qualities, particularly gar rulity and imitativeness, they possess in an ex traordinary degree. They are distributed through out the intertropical countries of both hemi spheres, as well as Australia and New Zealand. Eminently arboreal in habits, in them we see the perfection of the scansorial or zygodactyle form of the foot, the outer toe being turned completely behind. In the stone record there are, as is well known, few entries of birds ; but such as there are bear a general correspondence with this view of the genealogy of the class. The Connecticut footsteps chiefly point to tribes which stand early in the pedigree, namely, species allied in struc ture to the snipes and plovers. Others, from their gigantic size, have been thought only refer able to struthious birds \u2014 an equally early offshoot"], [347, "333 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. from the aquatic order. Some few are more dubiously assigned to rasorial birds. With re gard to the absence, here or at an earlier period, of swimming birds, let it be considered that the phenomena are extremely local and limited ; also, that the spot investigated is a portion of an ancient shore, a haunt of wading rather than of swimming birds. Recently, indeed, it has been announced that one of the birds indicated by7 the footmarks was a swimming bird \u2014 a fulica, or coot ; but, as all such announcements require confirmation, little can be founded upon this, more especially as a footprint resembling that of a finch was spoken of at the same time. In rocks posterior to the Connecticut footmarks, but within the secondary formation, occur three bird fossils, one referred to the snipe family, another to the albatross, and the third to the swallow ; the majority being thus applicable to early por tions of the genealogy. When we at length come into the tertiary formation, we find, in the eocene, a vulterine bird ; soon after which ornitholites, as they are called, become of greater abundance ; and \" here,\" says Mr. Strickland, \" as in every other department of the animal kingdom, we perceive a rapid approximation to the fauna,"], [348, "334 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL which is characteristic of the period in which we live.\"(78) Finally, we have to inquire into the connexions between the Mammalia and the lower vertebrate classes. Naturalists place the Birds between tbe Reptiles and Mammals ; yet in some respects the birds are not truly intermediate. We are the less to be surprised on finding that the principal mammal orders appear to be immediately con nected with the Reptiles, while only the lowest come through the birds. As usual in transitions from class to class, which in general are the leaps of the development process, the passage from reptile and bird to mammal is obscure ; only in dicated in a few stray facts. Perhaps the fossil blank at the conclusion of the cretaceous era has helped to keep light from this subject. Still we have enough to bear us out in saying, that, as the fish connect with reptiles, and these with birds, so do reptiles and birds together connect with mammalia ; thus placing the general fact of the continued development of animal life from its lowest to its highest point beyond a doubt. The first glimpse of the mammalian type pre sented by geological research is in the Cetiosaur, a huge reptile of the Oolite, nearly allied to the"], [349, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 335 marine sauria, but exhibiting in the form of the larger vertebr\u00e6 a clear affinity to the whale tribes. In connexion with this fact, the physiologist tells us, that in the manatus and dugong, specimens of these tribes, there is a dense texture of bone, and an absence of medullary7 cavities, assimilating their skeleton to the reptiles, which class they further resemble in the loose connexion of the bones of the head. It would thus appear, in this grand instance, as in all others, that the starting point of the superior class was in the marine and consequently earliest examples of that below; for the trunk of the genealogical tree of Being is short compared with the branches. The passage from the Birds to the mammalia connected with them happens (for accident in the preservation of species and the discovery of fossils is much concerned in the case) to be more mani fest. Somewhat unexpectedly \u2014 but Nature must be taken as we find her \u2014 it is the humblest mam malian orders which come through this protracted channel. They are the Digging Edentata (arma dillos, ant-eaters, pangolins, &c), the Insectivora (moles, hedgehogs, &c), and Rodentia (mice, squirrels, hares). By all modern comparative anatomists it is allowed that these show, in their"], [350, "336 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL osseous structure, imperfect dentition, and humble character of brain, an affinity to birds. There is, however, another order of animals, which can hardly be considered as fully mammalian in cha racter ; Implacental Mammalia they may at the best be called ; and which are even nearer to the bird character than the three orders above enu merated. These are the Monotremes and Marsu pials ; animals now almost restricted to Australia, but which were formerly more widely distributed. In the brain and other parts of the organization, they are decidedly bird-like. But this is not all, for, in the only surviving monotremes, the omi thorhynchus and echidna, we see the bill and web-feet of the swimming-bird still unchanged, the former animal being a semi-rodent, and the latter a semi-insectivore. Here is a gradation most remarkable, the point reached being only, as it were, half way towards the higher form of existence. It is also very remarkable to find amongst the more numerous marsupials, genera recalling the rodent and the insectivorous forms, as if these were only further advances along similar lines. Reverting to the genealogy of the higher orders of Mammalia, we find ourselves introduced by the"], [351, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 337 cetiosaur and the remark as to the osteology of the dugong, into the confines of the Cetacea, the marine or fish-like order of their class. In this group of animals, what first strikes us is that, while united by a common medium of existence, and some peculiarities fitted thereto, they are otherwise extremely various, as much so indeed as all the land mammalia together. The whale, the dolphin, the seal, are animals fully as diffe rent from each other as the panther and the ele phant, the deer and monkey. Naturalists now begin to say that the Carnivora (lions, bears, genets, shrews) are represented in the seals, and the great pachyderms in the cetacea ; \u2014 the rumi nants, also, in the herbivorous cetes (manatus and dugong). Obscure as is our knowledge of the aquatic mammals, this relation is indubitable, but its real character has never been read. It be comes quite intelligible when we arrive at the idea of a genealogical system ; but in no other way, to all appearance, can it be explained. The aquatic mammals are not properly one distinct order, nor two either. They merely form the initiatory stages of certain terrestrial orders, \u25a0a cross section, as it were, at the bottom of Q"], [352, "338 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL those orders, and part of the composite chain by which they are connected with the reptiles. The first of these terrestrial orders is that of the Carnivora: it starts in the seals (Phocid\u00e6). We see in that family genera bearing a positive resemblance to both the ursine and the feline tribes, and respectively called in consequence sea-bears and sea-lions. It is also of importance in the case of the bears, that there are genera (such as the arctic bear) geographically adjacent to the haunts of the phocal tribes, partly similar in their semi-aquatic habits, and also akin in the low (plantigrade) organization of their hind ex tremities. From the bears \u2014 startling as it may appear\u2014 proceed the Canid\u0153 (wolf, fox, dog), in which there is at once an improvement in fonn (digitigrade) and an advance in intelligence. Let not prejudice resist this pedigree. We must re member that the clog is still a carnivorous animal, and, in the wild state, a ferocious one. But the almost identity of teeth, and the fact of the bear and dog having proved fruitful, are the facts on which the genealogy chiefly rests. A third carnivorous line, which may be called the Musteline, is clearly traceable from the seal"], [353, "339 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. called the Otaria, through the sea-otter, the river otter, and so on to the shrews and musteline animals in general. One, in which the succession is not so distinctly seen, embraces the Viverrine animals, including the hy\u00e6na, procyon, genet, ichneumon, etc. The alliance of the Pachydermata to the whales is fuUy admitted by modern geologists, being seen in the thick and naked skin, the gigantic body, massive bones, and even the variable and irre gular teeth, peculiar to the latter animals. Here it is also important to observe that some of the pachyderms nearest to the whales in bulk, as the hippopotamus and rhinoceros, are partly aquatic in their habits. Even the elephants and tapirs are but one step further on to terrestrial habits, seeing that they chiefly haunt the Savannahs and jungles adjacent to great rivers. The Equid\u00e6 (horse, ass, quagga, onager) and the Suid\u0153 (pig, babyroussa, peccary) are pachyderms applicable to inland situations, reduced in bulk, but improved in organization. Their respective parentages in the bulkier families may be left for future deci sion. Meanwhile, Professor Owen's opinion may be quoted for a connexion between the hippo- Q2"], [354, "340 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL potamus and peccary through the medium of the Ch\u0153ropotamus, an extinct animal whose remains are found in South America. The herbivorous cetes, dugong, manatus, and walrus, form the basis of the great order Rumi nantia, to which they are allied in tbeir gregarious habits and large bulk, as well as in their food.('9) This order presents two distinct subdivisions \u2014 the Bovid\u0153 (aurochs, bison, buffalo, ox), leading on by such intermediate forms as the ovibos or musk-ox to the sheep ; and the Cervid\u0153 (elk, deer), leading on to the goat ; the animals of low and alluvial grounds thus, as usual, passing into smaller species adapted to more inland and ele vated situations. The last mammalian order is that which Lin n\u00e6us called Primates, comprehending, however, not only the monkeys and lemurs, and the Cheir optera or bats, but the Sloths (Bradypodid\u0153), winch Cuvier, merely from their want of certain teeth, placed elsewhere^80) For this order there remains a basis in the Delphinid\u0153, the last and smallest of the cetacean tribes. This affiliation has a special support in the brain of the Dolphin family, which is distinctly allowed to be, in pro portion to general bulk, the greatest amongst"], [355, "341 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. mammalia, next to the oran-outang and man. We learn from Tiedeman, that \" each of the cerebral hemispheres is composed, as in man and the monkey tribe, of three lobes \u2014 an anterior, a middle, and a posterior ;\" and these hemispheres \" present much more numerous circumvolutions and grooves than those of any other animal.\" Here it might be rash to found anything upon the ancient accounts of the dolphin \u2014 its familiarity with man, and its helping him in shipwreck and various marine disasters, although it is difficult to believe these stories to be altogether without some basis in fact. There is no doubt, however, that the dolphin evinces a predilection for human society7, and charms the mariner by the gambols which it performs beside his vessel. The first steps from this aquatic family are perhaps not to be seen upon earth. It appears as if we had to take up the lines in decidedly inland species \u2014 the Monkeys and Sloths, which are sylvan ; the Bats, which are partially aerial ; and man, who is geographically universal. For the sloths alone, do we discern any trace of intermediate species. These appear distinctly enough in the fossil megatherium and megalonyx.(81) The want of the rest is not a formidable difficulty, for it ap-"], [356, "342 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL pears, generally, that the species hovering be tween sea and land, or those adapted to live upon shores and low grounds, are most apt to become extinct. Hence it is that the tapirine and elephantine animals are visibly fading from the face of the earth. Thus has the anoplothere perished, while the llama survives. It cannot fail to be remarked that the geological history of the mammalia is, as far as we obtain from it any distinct ideas, in conformity with these views re garding their classification. The marsupials and aquatics appear early, even before the cretaceous era. After the long blank which that formation represents, what are the animals found predo minant in the beginning of the tertiary ? The great pachyderms and cetacea, particularly mana tid\u00e6. The dog, horse, and other culminating species of the various lines, come comparatively late, the sheep and goat not at all ; man also is absent, till the most recent formations. We cannot but regard with profound interest the question respecting our own immediate an cestry. The mind immediately refers to the simial family, whose form, size of brain, and general characters make so manifest an approach to our own. Yet it may be doubted if the parti-"], [357, "343 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. cular species whence the human family was de rived, has ever come under the attention of na turalists. It seems, judging from analogy, as isa larger species than any as yet described were re quired for this place in the tree of being. It may here be observed that of all the reptilian orders, the batrachian is that which has best pretensions to a place in the origin of the Primates. \" It is singular,\" says Dr. Roget, \" that the frog, though so low in the scale of vertebrated animals, should bear a striking resemblance to the human confor mation in its organs of progressive motion.\" It is the only7 animal besides man with a calf to its leg. It evidently \" is making,\" says Dr. Roget, \" an approximation to the higher orders of mam malia.\" The frog, however, is but a humble offshoot of the main line terminating in the Primates. There is something more like a lineal predecessor of the order in the Labyrinthodon of Owen, that massive batrachian, which leaves its hand-like footsteps in the New Red Sandstone, and then is seen no more. Not for nothing is it that we start at the picture of that strange impres sion, \u2014 ghost of anticipated humanity, \u2014 for appa rently it really is so. In these things the super ficial thinker will only see matter of ridicule : the"], [358, "344 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL large-hearted and truly devout man, who puts nothing of nature away from him, will, on the contrary, discover in them interesting traces of the ways of God to man, and a deeper breathing of the lesson, that whatever lives is to him kindred. Our view of the animal kingdom is now com pleted, and I venture to claim for it the character of being, with all necessary and unavoidable im perfections, the only approach yet made to a truly natural classification. Proceeding every where upon obvious affinities, most of them ad mitted by zoologists, or else upon equally ac knowledged facts in the doctrine of embry7ology, it presents an arrangement in almost every point conformable to pal\u00e6ontology, or the geological history of animals upon earth. Nay more ; so far is that history from being irreconcdable with any assumed progress of animated being from simple to complex forms, that I would now say, any discoveries violently altering it, or doing more than filling up its blanks, would be at issue with the true plan of being, and a source of doubt with regard to the whole of our hypothesis of creation. It now appears that the animal kingdom (and by analogy the vegetable also) is composed of series of forms, each usually taking an origin in"], [359, "345 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. the lowest sub-kingdom, and afterwards passing through higher grades, but not in every case through all, until the highest is reached. It ap pears that the grand matrix of organic being is the sea, that what may be called trunk lines- pass through this medium as high as the mammalian type, and that the terrestrial families may all be regarded as branches of these marine lines, though in some instances a passage from one class form to another has taken place on land. Two principles are thus seen at work in the pro duction of the organic tenants of the earth \u2014 first, a gestative development pressing on through the grades of organization, and bringing out par ticular organs necessary for new fields of exist ence ; secondly, a variative power re-acted upon by external conditions, and working to minor effects, though these may sometimes be hardly distinguishable from the other. Everywhere along tbe central scale of organization, the land has been, as it were, a temptation or provocation to new and superior forms adapted for inhabit ing it. We might almost regard the progression as the result of an aspiration towards new and supe rior fields of existence, as from the deep sea to the shallow or river-embouchure, from the shore Q3"], [360, "346 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL to the bank, from that again to the higher ground in the interior. He may not yet be held as a very fanciful naturalist who would regard the mega therium as eager to climb the tree which he could only7 shake, and thus producing a progeny fitted to do that which was the object of his wishes, \u2014 or the rock-nose whale, which loves to rest its head on rocks beside the beach, as wishful of that mode of life which was at length vouchsafed to a more highly developed descendant. Such too may be found to be the true principle of per fectibility in nature \u2014 a continual, though it may be an irregularly shown tendency to press on to better and better powers, \u2014 an indefinite improve ableness, which may work, as in seconds, in the individual, or strike hours in the species. The present view of the Genealogical Classifi cation of Animals was nearly completed, when my attention was drawn to certain appearances, as if the arrangement had what may be called a nu merical foundation. Within the last twenty-five years, Mr. Macleay originated a theory of this kind, which has been wrought out by Messrs. Swainson, Vigors, and other naturalists. The prevalent opinion amongst them was, that the true divisions and subdivisions were in groups of"], [361, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 347 five : thus, five sub-kingdoms, five classes of ver tebrata, five orders of the class mammalia, and so on, the general character of each class being re presented in a corresponding order, and the same character being further reflected even in the families or genera into which the orders were subdivided. There were striking appearances of a basis of truth in this theory, though, in the ex cessive ardour of its first advocates, it was carried to a pitch of refinement in whicb nature was lost sight of, and the whole was greatly marred by the notion that all the groups arranged them selves in circles. Acknowledging the value of the theory as, with all its faults, a great step in philosophical zoology, I shall proceed to show what have an appearance of being true grounds for some such arrangement of the animal kingdom. To me, as to Mr. Macleay and his followers, the Birds present the clearest traces of a deter minate grouping, with an analogous sub-group ing. We see three great divisions ; first, birds of solitary, predaceous, carnivorous habits ; se cond, birds of gregarious habits, accustomed to walking on the ground, slow of movement, large of bulk, generally granivorous, and harmless; third, birds which are, generally speaking, omni-"], [362, "348 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL vorous, rapid of movement, comparatively of small bulk, not merely gregarious, but social, often marked by garrulity, imitative power, cun ning, and mischievousness. The eagle and vul ture mark the first ; the common fowl, pigeons, and game birds, the second ; the crow, pie, parrot, thrush, lark, sparrow, the third. As for sub-groupings, it would be rash to attempt pre cision ; but certainly in the second, the geese, cranes, gallin\u00e6, and pigeons, with their peculiarly innocent characters, might stand as representa tives of the group itself, while the more carnivo rous ducks, herons, and plovers appear in analogy to the predaceous or first group, and the rails to the third. In the third group, again, the three are not less strikingly represented by the follow ing in succession \u2014 the shrikes and warblers, \u2014 the larks and sparrows, \u2014 the parrots, toucans, pies, starlings, &c. If we start from the birds with these three general characters in our mind, we shall find that the reptdes fall under them in this order ; \u2014 the Sauria \u2014 the Chelonia\u2014 the Batrachia. So do the Mammalia, after we have laid aside those which appear as lateral offshoots through the birds. They rank thus : the Carnivora \u2014 the Herbivora"], [363, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 349 (using this term to include pachyderms, equid\u00e6, and ruminants) \u2014 and the Primates. Thus, again, analyse the Herbivora, and it seems allowable to regard such animals as the pig and hippopotamus as representing the carnivores, the ruminants as representing the innocent group, and the equid\u00e6, with their rapid movements and familiar charac ter, as standing appositely to the third. So also, in the third, the bats \u2014 the sloths \u2014 and the apes \u2014 appear in precisely the same series of rela tions. Whether there be still another grade of sub-analogies, I wdl not take it upon me in any manner to pronounce. It may here be remarked that this system is not affected by any determination which may be arrived at with regard to the genealogy of the birds, for these, whether descended from one order of reptiles or all three, would exhibit the same groupings. It may also be remarked that their supposed descendants, the Edentata, Ro dentia, and Insectivora, conform to the relations as thus collocated. The Fish must not yet be speculated upon ; but in the Mollusca, I am tempted to think that the relations apply in this order \u2014 Cephalopoda \u2014 Gasteropoda \u2014 Cochifera. Even with those relations here indicated, we"], [364, "350 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL acquire \u2014 first the idea of three great strands of organic being, each composed of three inferior strands, respectively representing the principal lines, and which probably were the true genealo gical series of our system. Verily, it would give us a curious conception of organic nature, if we could satisfy ourselves that, like chemistry, it had a my'Sterious foundation in mathematical propor tions. Threes under threes, each subordinate three reflecting the trinity to which it belongs, and all others ! Such an idea is obviously fa vourable to the development theory, as arguing a unity in animated nature, and the definite cha racter of its entire constitution. It suggests how, under the flowing robes of nature, where all looks arbitrary and accidental, there is an artificiality of the most rigid kind. The Natural appears to sink into and merge in a higher Artificial. To adopt a comparison more apt than dignified, we may7 be said to be placed here as insects in a garden of the old style. Our first unassisted view is limited, and we perceive only the irregulari ties of the minute surface, and single shrubs which appear arbitrarily scattered. But our view at length extending and becoming more compre-"], [365, "351 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. hensive, we begin to see parterres balancing each other, trees, statues, and arbours placed symme trically, and that the whole is an assemblage of parts mutually reflective. It can scarcely be necessary to point to the inference hence arising with regard to the origination of nature in some Power, of which man's mind is a humble and faint representation. The insects of the garden, supposing them to be invested with reasoning power, and aware how artificial are their own works, might, of course, very reasonably con clude that, being in its totality an artificial ob ject, the garden was the work of some maker or artificer. And so also, when we attain a knowledge of the artificiality which is at the basis of nature, must we conclude that nature is wholly the production of a being resembling, but infinitely greater than ourselves. By the same light we are enabled to see more clearly than ever the providential arrangement with respect to the various characters of ani mals ; some to draw nutriment directly from the vegetable kingdom ; others to keep the numbers of these in check, and prevent their carcasses from cumbering the earth \u2014 to be, in fact, a me-"], [366, "352 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL dium for returning their constituent substances to the atmosphere from which these were ori ginally extracted by the vegetation ; others again destined to a higher and more intelligent en joyment than either, and turning animal as well as vegetable substances to their use. It is most interesting also to trace by this light the perseve rance of characters and habits, and even of points in organization, from grade to grade. Travelling in the east, we might see the gavial acting as the scavenger of the Ganges, and the clog serving the same purpose in the neglected streets of the great cities : the latter, a descendant of the line of being of which the former is an offshoot, merely serves on land the purpose served by his relative in the river. The vulture corresponds amongst birds, and the shark amongst fishes, to the dog amongst the mammalian carnivora: be hold all of these animals furnished alike with the most acute powers of smell, for the discovery of their prey. A living naturalist speaks thus of the resemblance of the parrots to the monkeys : \u2014 \" There can be little doubt that the parrots, among birds, emulate the monkeys among placen tals: they eat all kinds of food they can procure ; they obtain it in the same situations ; they seek"], [367, "353 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. it in the same way, \u2014 by climbing, \u2014 for a parrot actually climbs like a monkey ; it does not leap or run like other birds ; but, like a monkey, or more especially a lemur, climbs slowly and so- lemnly from bough to bough : its toes are placed two and two, presenting an exact analogy to the opposable thumb of the Primates ; and its foot is constantly used as a hand for conveying food to the mouth : its chattering voice is also similar, and in the gift of speech it rivals man himself : its large brain and peculiar tact in imitation are still additional simdarities. I should, therefore, place the genus Psittacus as one of the Primates among birds. (82) The explanation is easy: the monkeys either are the descendants of the line which at an earlier period gave parrots, or the parrots come from a sub-line representing the monkey7s in their greater line. In the same way, the pig is the relative or analogue of the duck, the bullock of the turkey, the squirrel of the monkey, the furtive springing cat of the equally furtive springing serpent, and so forth. Strange thus to trace in the humble and ancient animal a prophecy of the higher and more recent ; the cephalopod, for example, foreshowing the shark the shark the saurian, the saurian the vulture"], [368, "354 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL and mammalian carnivore. Equally curious to see the migratory habits of the chelonia re-pro duced in the migratory habits which attach both to birds ancl to the ruminants : thus the voyage of three thousand miles which the turtle will make in order to lay her eggs on Ascension island, the vast vernal flight of the swallow from Africa to England for incubation, the roaming disposition of the hyperborean deer and the American bison, are all kindred phenomena, comprehended under one law of their gracious Creator : each race and sub-race true from first to last to its allotted in stincts. A result of very profound interest may be ex pected from the perfect development of this view of the system of nature ; it will enable us to see with tolerable distinctness the status of man as one of the vessels of life. Even from the sketch now before us we may draw some curious infer ences. It appears that the stirps which termi nates in the Primates is one which may be con sidered as central between the other two, combin ing characters from both, along with characters of its own. Its central sub-line is eminently eclectic, and particularly in its food, uniting the carni vorous instincts of the bats, on the one hand, with"], [369, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 355 the phytophagous habits of the sloths, on the other. Sociality, vocality or the use of voice, a prehensive use of the extremities, imitativeness, drollery, sagacity, all form characteristics gene rally applicable to this line of animals. They are, in the reptilian grade, and perhaps in inferior grades also, rather below than above their fellows ; but in the mammalian stage, they7 suddenly ascend to a pre-eminence, not by superior strength, but by greater relative magnitude of brain, by agility, and by the use of the hand. The signal supe riority of the human species is thus prepared for and betokened in the immediately preceding portions of the line : it might have been seen, ere man existed, that a remarkable creature was coming upon the earth. The advance, neverthe less, which man makes above his immediate pre decessors is very great; the highest of these cannot rank above an infant of our species in sagacity or morale. This advance is no isolated fact. In each of the other sub-lines, there is what may be called a crowning species, greatly superior to its imme diate ancestry, and these are the most distin guished of all animals. In the herbivorous stirps, the sub-carnivorous line is topped by the pig, the"], [370, "356 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL sub-herbivorous by tbe sheep, the sub-central by the horse. In the carnivorous stirps, the sub central is topped by the dog. The horse and dog, so eminent for their sagacity and usefulness, are in this peculiar manner analogues to man, whom they serve so faithfully. A signal supe riority, however, belongs to him as the centre and apex of all ; the undoubted king and lord of this portion of animated nature. His greatness \u2014 considering him merely as a unit in the animal kingdom \u2014 lies primarily in the concentration of qualities which he derives from this situation. He is not an animal solely herbivorous, or solely carnivorous ; solely innocent, or solely destruc tive. He has all these characters and habits, with the addition of others proper to his own family of being. There is great virtue in this principle of concentration, or, as it may rather be called, this universality of character. We see that an intensity of it marks all the greatest in dividuals of our species, such as Shakspeare and Scott, of whom it has been observed that they must have possessed within themselves, not only the poet, but the warrior, the statesman, the phi losopher, and the man of affairs, and who, more over, appear to have had the mild and manly, the"], [371, "357 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. moral and impulsive parts of our nature, in the finest balance. When the naturalists of modern times began to inquire into the geographical distribution of plants and animals, they quickly found that the prevalent notion of their dispersion from one common centre was untenable. From facts ob served by them, they have latterly concluded that, so far from this being the case, there are many provinces of the earth's surface occupied by plants and animals almost wholly peculiar, and which must accordingly have had a separate origin. Professor Henslow, of Cambridge, speaks of no fewer than forty-five such provinces for the vege table kingdom alone. A botanical or zoological province is generally isolated in some manner, \u2014 either as an island in the midst of a wide ocean \u2014 as, for example, St. Helena, or the Isle de Bourbon \u2014 or as a portion of a continent separated from the rest either by a range of high mountains, or by the boundaries of a climate. It is also found that elevation of position comes to the same effect with regard to vegetation as advance in latitude ; so that, as we ascend a lofty mountain in a tropical country, we"], [372, "358 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL gradually pass through zones exhibiting the plants of kinds appropriate to temperate and arctic regions. Even the neighbourhood of a salt marsh, however remotely placed amongst grounds of a different kind, exhibits plants appropriate to such a soil. Fewer distinct zoological regions are enume rated, but perhaps only in consequence of imper fect observation. Here, however, the evidences against communication of organisms from one region to another are even more decided. If, however, it were surmised that the organisms of isolated regions had been communicated from other countries, and merely modified in their new abodes, the disproof of the conjecture would be more positive with regard to the zoology of the question than the botany. For, while it might appear possible that seeds had been floated even five hundred miles to a new soil like that of the Isle de Bourbon, how can we account, by such a supposition, for the existence there of bats, rep tiles, ancl other animals, the progenitors of which could never have swam so far for the sake of a change of residence ? This island, be it re marked, is of volcanic origin, and known to have become dry land at a comparatively recent period."], [373, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 359 The two great continents of the earth are the first zoological divisions of its surface. The animals as well as plants of the old and new world are specifically different, with very few ex ceptions ; that is, they are different in the degree which naturalists agree to consider as sufficient to establish distinct species. But even North and South America present different animals. We also find that the animals in the north and south of Asia are different, and that most of the African species are distinct from those of Asia. The differences are in some instances so great as to be held by7 naturalists as generic. Beyond this point, however, there are parities or identi ties. We see, for instance, in all these various regions, feline animals, ruminants, pachyderms, rodents, etc. Thus, for the lion and tiger of Asia, we have a different lion and the panther in Africa, the jaguar in South America, and the puma ranging from Brazil to Canada. Instead of the elk of Northern Europe, and the argali of Siberia, we have, in North America, the moose deer and mountain sheep. Asia and Africa have elephants, to winch the extinct mastodon of Northern Europe and the extinct mammoth of North America are parallels ; and it now appears"], [374, "360 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL that even the horse, of which there are several varieties in the old world, was abundant in the new, at a period long antecedent to the introduc tion of the present breed by the colonists. Aus tralia has its emeu, Africa its ostrich, and America her rhea, all similar animals, though specifically different. We find simi\u00e6 planted in three great regions \u2014 Southern Asia, Western Africa, and equinoctial America, but all of different character, those of America being peculiarly distinct in their want of the opposable thumb and of callosities in the seat, as also in the use of the tail as a pre hensile instrument. Australia has only a few very unimportant mammalian animals of her own besides the marsupials, which are represented by a few species in America ; but to the southern part of the latter continent are confined the whole family of the sloths. Africa, in like manner, has exclusive possession of the giraffe. To North America belongs a great number of genera of birds quite peculiar to it, and also a greater number and variety of the rodents than are found in other parts of the earth. Similar facts could be stated respecting other classes of animals ; but I limit attention to the mammalia,"], [375, "361 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. as being the most restricted in number and the best known. Some principles governing the parity and vari ation of the organisms spread over different regions have been observed. It is found, for in stance, that there is more uniformity between two continents which are both in the north or south hemisphere, albeit divided by wide oceans, than between two portions of one continent extending into both of these hemispheres. North America is zoologically less allied to South America than it is to Northern Europe. An island, however far apart, is apt to show zoological features reflec tive of those of the nearest continent. Two coun tries, again, divided only by a narrow sea, have usually the same flora. Some principle affecting the development of the higher animals can also be detected, in con nexion with geological chronology*. Startling as it may appear, we are now assured that the present great continent comprising Europe, Asia, and Africa, has been, with minor changes in the relative position of sea and land, one theatre of organic being since the commencement of the existence of land animals upon the surface of the earth ; that is to say, there has been, on one it"], [376, "362 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL part or another of this geographical area, an uninterrupted chain of living forms from an early period in the secondary formation. This is the zoological province whose history is presented by the geologists ; it is the oldest we are acquainted with. There are, however, some isolated regions whicii are known with certainty to have been in a condition of dry land for a less space of time. Such are the volcanic islands, of which the Isle of Bourbon is an example. Such also are the Galapagos islands, placed in the Pacific, above five hundred miles from South America. Now it is remarkable in such regions to find the mam malia either wholly wanting or in very small numbers. Australia itself \u2014 a fifth great section of the habitable globe \u2014 appears to be one of these regions of an incomplete zoology. It is well known to have no native mammalia besides that humble implacental kind which are nearly pecu liar to it, and a few rodents and bats. Professor Owen remarks how the fishes of the oolitic era \u2014 acrodus, psammodus, etc. \u2014 with the contemporary mollusks (trigoni\u00e6 and terebratul\u0153), which served these fishes for food, are represented in the living cestraceon which swims the Australian seas, with"], [377, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 363 exactly* the same sea mollusks to yield them sus tenance. \" Araucari\u00e6 and cycadeous plants like wise,\" he says, \"flourish on the Australian con tinent, where marsupial quadrupeds abound, and thus appear to complete a picture of an ancient condition of the earth's surface, which has been superseded in our hemisphere by other strata and a higher type of mammalian organization.'^83) Such being the facts of the case, we are to inquire whether they best agree with the hypo thesis of an origin of organisms by special Divine exertion, or that of their origination in Divine power working in the manner of natural law ; and also, if the latter supposition appear preferable, how far the facts agree with the plan of animated nature delineated in the preceding pages. It is remarkable at the very first that there is any variety of species in different regions, more especially as the species of one region usually thrive when transplanted to another of generally similar character in point of soil and climate. Had organisms been produced by special atten tion \u2014 taking this according to any ideas we can form of it \u2014 we might rather have expected to see identical plants in similar countries. It will not avail here to attribute the variation to the cultiva- R 2"], [378, "364 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL tion of variety as a principle on the part of tbe Divine Disposer, for the differences evidently follow no such principle, being of various inten sities in near and in remote situations. In this consideration, there is a great obstacle to the re ception of the special-exertion hypothesis. It seems much more likely7 that organisms took their rise in germs springing from inorganic elements ; which germs being different in accordance with such slight local differences in the combinations of the elements as physical studies inform us of, and the external conditions attending their deve lopment being also locally different, the resulting vessels of life were various accordingly. Such variations of result are exactly of a piece with hundreds of other simply natural events \u2014 for ex ample, the difference of animals bom at one birth ; and similar natural causes are therefore presumable for them. The facts respecting the geographical distri bution of organisms are in perfect harmony with the plan of their origin, which, from the geo logical history, the principles of organic develop ment, and their external affinities, has here been sketched. That plan necessitates the facts of dis tribution, which the other hypothesis does not."], [379, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 365 First, a development of vegetable organisms, we shall say, taking place in the sea, it is exactly what we would expect that they should spread upon the neighbouring shores in every direction, and that we should thus, for example, have one flora surrounding the Mediterranean, \u2014 which is the fact. So it is also likely that islands should botanically and zoologically partake of the cha- racter of the neighbouring continents. In regions, on the other hand, sufficiently distant to be in- volved in the influence of diverse foci of life, we are to expect differences proportioned to the difference of original elements, and also of condi- tions attending the development of the various lines ; there we may only expect to see such ultimate parities attained as those between the emeu of Australia and the rhea of America, or the jaguar and puma of the latter continent and the tiger of Asia. Here it is important to observe that the cetacea and the marine birds in the neighbour- hood of the different continents, present less varia- tion than do the land mammals and birds : they have advanced less way along the lines, and have been less exposed to the conditions productive of external variations. In the case of a well-defined zoological region, such as the northern parts of"], [380, "366 AFFINITIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL North America, we see the indigenous animals expressly confined to those famdies which our plan sets forth as springing from the marine tribes above adverted to. There is the polar bear, with his various progeny, the brown bear, black bear, the wolf, fox, and dog ; these from a phocal ancestry. The sea-otter, sprung from an allied stock, gives birth to the few musteline animals which dwell in these dreary regions. Then we have herbivorous cetes, giving rise to the moose deer and musk ox, these again being the pro genitors of the goat and sheep. And finally, we have the unusually numerous rodents from the aquatic birds, which nowhere are seen in greater numbers than on the borders of the Arctic Ocean. Such, with the mole, is the whole show of mam malia in this province : it is, it will be observed, of a limited kind ; but it is interesting to remark that it presents nearly all the animals of that class, which we have supposed from their affinities to be descended from the marine famdies of which there is such abundance upon the adjacent ocean. And, supposing this ocean to be the berceau of these land animals, we can easily see why they should be more akin to the terrestrial mammalia of Northern Europe than to those of South Ame-"], [381, "DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. 367 rica. The Northern Ocean, spreading in one character of climate along the confines of the two first regions, enables a set of maritime animals which may have come into existence in any part of it, to spread into the two continents alike \u2014 the same bear, nearly the same ruminants, and so forth ; but, if the Southern Ocean have possessed, as is likely fi*om its distance, a different develop ment of animal life from the Northern, and be supposed as sending off terrestrial animals in like manner into South America, the interposition of several great zones of different climate stands forth as a sufficient reason why there should not have been the same communication of zoological forms in that case to the hyperborean seas, as there was from those laving North America to those which clash upon Scandinavia, Russia, and Siberia. The hypothesis is equally applicable to the imperfect developments of life upon the more recently raised lands, such as the Galapagos islands and Australia. Development is a matter of time, and in the case of these regions, the full time has not yet elapsed. It is therefore exactly what we might expect, upon the natural hypo thesis, that, in these regions, animal life should"], [382, "368 DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. have yet hardly reached the mammalian stage, the point which was attained in our elder and greater province about the time of the oolite. (**) But no rational cause for this imperfect zoological show can be presented in consonance with the plan of special exertions. Its advocates can only refer to some vague assumption regarding the Divine will, to which it is treason against judg ment to come, while a single surmise of natural procedure remains unexhausted."], [383, "369 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. The human race is known to consist of numerous nations, displaying considerable differences of external form and colour, and speaking in general different languages. This has been the case since the commencement of written record. It is also ascertained that the external peculiarities of particular nations do not change rapidly. While a people remain upon one geographical era, and under the influence of one set of conditions, they always exhibit a tendency to persistency of type, insomuch that a subordinate admixture of various type is usually obliterated in a few generations. Numerous as the varieties are, they have all been found classifiable under five leading ones : \u2014 1. The Caucasian, or Indo-European, which R 3"], [384, "370 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND extends from India into Europe and Northern Africa; 2. The Mongolian, which occupies Northern and Eastern Asia; 3. The Malayan, which extends from the Ultra-Gangetic Penin sula into the numerous islands of the South Seas and Pacific ; 4. The Negro, chiefly confined to Africa ; 5. The Aboriginal American. Each of these is distinguished by certain general fea tures of so marked a kind, as to suggest to many inquirers that they have had distinct or indepen dent origins. Of these peculiarities, colour is the most conspicuous : the Caucasians are generally white, the Mongolians yellow, the Negroes black, ancl the Americans red. The opposition of two of these in particular, white and black, is so striking, that of them, at least, it seems almost necessary to suppose separate origins. Of late years, however, the whole of this question has been subjected to a rigorous investigation by a British philosopher, who has been remarkably successful in adducing evidence that the human race might have had one origin, for anything that can be inferred from external peculiarities. It appears from this inquiry, (85) that colour and other physiological characters are of a more superficial and accidental nature than was at one"], [385, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 371 time supposed. One fact is at the very first ex tremely* startling, that there are nations, such as the inhabitants of Hindostan, apparently one in descent, which nevertheless contain groups of people of almost all shades of colour, and like wise discrepant in other of those important fea tures on which much stress has been laid. Some other facts, which may be stated in brief terms, are scarcely less remarkable. In Africa, there are Negro nations, \u2014 that is, nations of intensely black complexion, as the Jolofs, Mandingoes, and Kafirs, whose features and limbs are as elegant as those of the best European nations. While we have no proof of Negro races becoming white in tbe course of generations, the converse may be held as established, for there are Arab and Jewish families of ancient settlement in Northern Africa, who have become as black as the other inhabi tants. There are also facts which seem to show the possibility of a natural transition by genera tion from the black to the white complexion, and from the white to the black. True whites (apart from Albinoes) are not unfrequently born among the Negroes, and the tendency to this singularity is transmitted in families. There is, at least, one authentic instance of a set of perfectly black"], [386, "372 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. children being born to an Arab couple, in whose ancestry no such blood had intermingled. This occurred in the valley of the Jordan, where it is remarkable that the Arab population in general have flatter features, darker skins, and coarser hair, than any other tribes of the same nation. (86) The style of living is ascertained to have a powerful effect in modifying the human figure in the course of generations, and this even in its osseous structure. About two hundred years ago, a number of people were driven by a barbarous policy from the counties of Antrim and Down, in Ireland, towards the sea-coast, where they have ever since been settled, but in unusually miser able circumstances even for Ireland ; and the consequence is, that they exhibit peculiar fea tures of the most repulsive kind, projecting jaws with large open mouths, depressed noses, bigh cheek bones, and bow legs, together with an ex tremely diminutive stature. These, with an ab normal slenderness of the limbs, are the outward marks of a low and barbarous condition all over the world ; it is particularly seen in the Austra lian aborigines. On the other hand, the beauty of the higher ranks in England is very remark able, being, in the main, as clearly a result of"], [387, "373 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. good external conditions. \" Coarse, unwhole some, and ill-prepared food,\" says Buffon, \" makes the human race degenerate. All those people who live miserably are ugly and ill-made. Even in France, the country people are not so beautiful as those who live in towns ; and I have often remarked that in those villages where the people are richer and better fed than in others, the men are likewise more handsome, and have better countenances.\" He might have added, that elegant and commodious dwellings, cleanly habits, comfortable clothing, and being exposed to the open air only as much as health requires, co-operate with food in increasing the elegance of a race of human beings. Variations .also arise, through inexplicable causes, amidst a state of things generally perma nent. They tend most to occur among the humbler families of plants and animals, but also frequently take place in the very highest. A notable instance of variety7-production in an animal family by no means low, is often referred to, as having happened under the observation of persons still alive to attest it. On a New England farm there originated, in the latter part of the last century, a variety of sheep with"], [388, "374 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. unusually short legs, which was kept up by breed ing, on account of the convenience in that coun try of having sheep which are unable to leap over low fences. The starting and maintaining a breed of cattle, that is, a variety marked by some desirable peculiarity, are familiar to a large class of persons. It appears only necessary, when a variety has been thus produced, that a union should take place between individuals similarly characterized, and that the conditions under which it has been produced should be persisted in, in order to establish it. Early in the last century, a man named Lambert w7as born in Suf folk, with semi-horny excrescences, of about half an inch long, thickly growing all over bis body. The peculiarity was transmitted to his children, and was last heard of in a third generation. The peculiarity of six fingers on the hand and six toes on the feet, appears in like manner in fami lies which have no record nor tradition of such a peculiarity having affected them at any former period, and it is then sometimes seen to descend through several generations. It was Mr. Law rence's opinion, that a pair, in which both parties were so distinguished, might be the progenitors of a new variety of the race, who would be thus"], [389, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 375 marked in all future time. We have but obscure notions of the laws which regulate this variability within specific limits ; but we see them continu ally operating, and they are obviously favourable to the supposition that all the great families of men may have been of one stock. The tendency of the modern study of the lan guages of nations is to the same point. The last fifty years have seen this study elevated to the character of a science, and the light which it throws upon the history of mankind is of a most remarkable nature. Following a natural analogy, philologists have thrown the earth's languages into a kind of classi fication : a number bearing a considerable resem blance to each other, and in general geographi cally near, are styled a group or sub-family ; several groups, again, are associated as a family, with regard to more general features of resem blance. Six families are spoken of. The Indo-European family7 nearly coincides in geographical limits with those which have been assigned to that variety of mankind which gene rally shows a fair complexion, called the Cauca sian variety. It may be said to commence in India, and thence to stretch through Persia into"], [390, "376 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. Europe, the whole of which it occupies, excepting Hungary, the Basque provinces of Spain, and Finland. Its sub-families are the Sanskrit, or ancient language of India, the Persian, the Slavonic, Celtic, Gothic, and Pelasgian. The Slavonic includes the modern languages of Russia ancl Poland. Under the Gothic, are (1) the Scandinavian tongues, the Norske, Swedish, and Danish ; and (2) the Teutonic, to which belong the modern German, the Dutch, and our own Anglo-Saxon. I give the name of Pelasgian to the group scattered along the north shores of the Mediterranean, the Greek and Latin, including the modifications of the latter under the names of Italian, Spanish, &c. The Celtic w7as, from two to three thousand years ago, the speech of a considerable tribe dwelling in Western Europe ; but these have since been driven before superior nations into a few corners, and are now only to be found in the highlands of Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, and certain parts of France. The Gaelic of Scotland, Erse of Ireland, and the Welsh, are the only living branches of this sub-family of languages. The resemblances amongst languages are of two kinds, \u2014 identity of words, and identity of"], [391, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 377 grammatical forms; the latter being now gene rally considered as the most important towards the argument. When we inquire into the first kind of affinity among the languages of the Indo- European family7, we are surprised at the great number of common terms which exist among them, and these referring to such primary ideas as to leave no doubt of their having all been de rived from a common source. Colonel Vans Kennedy7 presents nine hundred words common to the Sanskrit and other languages of the same famdy. In the Sanskrit and Persian, we find several which require no sort of translation to an English reader, as pader, mader, sunu, dokhter, brader, mand, vidhava ; likewise asthi, a bone, (Greek, osteon ;) denta, a tooth, (Latin, dens, dentis ;) eyeumen, the eye ; brouwa, the eye-brow, (German, braue;) nasa, the nose ; haru, the hand, (Gr. cheir ;) genu, the knee, (Lat. genu ;) ped, the foot, (Lat. pes, pedis ;) hrti, the heart ; jecur, the liver, (Lai. jecur ;) stara, a star; gela, cold, (Lat. gelu, ice ;) aghni, fire, (Lat. ignis ;) dhara, the earth, (Lat. terra, Gaelic, tir ;) arrivi, a river; nau, a ship, (Gr. naus, Lat. navis ;) ghau, a cow ; sarpam, a serpent. The inferences from these verbal coincidences"], [392, "378 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. were confirmed in a striking manner when Bopp and others investigated the grammatical struc ture of this family of languages. Dr. Wiseman pronounces that the great philologist just named, \" by a minute and sagacious analysis of the Sanskrit verb, compared with the conjugational system of the other members of this family, left no doubt of their intimate and positive affinity.\" It was now discovered that the peculiar termina tions or inflections by which persons are ex pressed throughout the verbs of nearly the whole of these languages, have their foundations in pronouns ; the pronoun was simply placed at the end, and thus became an inflection. \" By an analysis of the Sanskrit pronouns, the ele ments of those existing in all the other languages were cleared of their anomalies ; the verb sub stantive, which in Latin is composed of frag ments referable to two distinct roots, here found both existing in regular form ; the Greek conju gations, with all their complicated machinery of middle voice, augments, and reduplications, were here found ancl illustrated in a variety of ways, which a few years ago would have appeared chi merical. Even our own language may some times receive light from the study of distant"], [393, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 379 members of our family. Where, for instance, are we to seek for the root of our comparative better ? Certainly not in its positive, good, nor in the Teutonic dialects in which the same ano maly exists. But in the Persian we have pre cisely the same comparative, behter, with exactly the same signification, regularly formed from its positive belt, good.\"(87) The second great family of languages is the Syro-Ph\u0153nician, comprising the Hebrew, Syro- Chaldaic, Arabic, and Gheez or Abyssinian, being localized principally in the countries to the west and south of the Mediterranean. Beyond them, again, is the African family, which, as far as research has gone, seems to be in like manner marked by common features, both verbal and grammatical. The fourth is the Polynesian family, extending from Madagascar on the west, through the Indian Archipelago, besides taking in the Malayan dialect from the continent of India, and comprehending Australia and the islands of the western portion of the Pacific. This family, however, bears such an affinity to that next to be described, that Dr. Leyden and some others do not give it a distinct place as a family of languages. The fifth family is the Chinese, embracing a"], [394, "380 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. large part of China, and most of the regions of Central and Northern Asia. The leading features of the Chinese language are, its consisting alto gether of monosyllables, and being destitute of all grammatical forms, except certain arrange ments and accentuations, which vary the sense of particular words. It is also deficient in some of the consonants most conspicuous in other lan guages, b, d, r, v, and z ; so that this people can scarcely* pronounce our speech in such a way as to be intelligible : for example, the word Christus they call Kuliss-ut-oo-suh. The Chinese, strange to say, though they early attained to a remarkable degree of civilization, and have pre ceded the Europeans in many of the most impor tant inventions, have a language which resembles that of children, or deaf and dumb people. The sentence of short, simple, unconnected words, in which an infant amongst us attempts to express some of its wants and its ideas\u2014 the equally broken and difficult terms which the deaf and dumb express by signs, as the following passage of the Lord's Prayer !\u2014 \" Our Father, heaven in, wish y7our name respect, wish your soul's king dom providence arrive, wish your will do heaven earth equality,\" &c. \u2014 these are like the discourse"], [395, "381 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. of the refined people of the so-called Celestial Empire. An attempt was made by the Abbe Sicard to teach the deaf and dumb grammatical signs ; but they persisted in restricting them selves to the simple signs of ideas, leaving the structure undetermined by any but the natural order of connexion. Such is exactly the condi tion of the Chinese language. Crossing the Pacific, we come to the last great famdy7, in the languages of the aboriginal Ameri cans, which have all of them features in common, proving them to constitute a group by them selves, without any regard to the very different degrees of civilization which these nations had attained at the time of the discovery. The com mon resemblance is in the grammatical structure as well as in words, and the grammatical struc ture of this family is of a very7 peculiar and com plicated kind. The general character in this re spect has caused the term Polysynthetic to be applied to the American languages. A long many-syllabled word is used by the rude Algon quins and Delawares to express a whole sen tence : for example, a woman of the latter nation, playing with a little clog or cat, would perhaps be heard saying, \" kuligatschis\" meaning, \" give me"], [396, "382 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. your pretty little paw;\" the word, on examina tion, is found to be made up in this manner : k, the second personal pronoun; uli, part of the word wulet, pretty ; gat, part of the word wichgat, signifying a leg or paw ; schis, conveying the idea of littleness. In the same tongue, a youth is called pilape, a word compounded from the first part of pilsit, innocent, and the latter part of lenape, a man. Thus, it will be observed, a number of parts of words are taken and thrown together, by a pro cess which has been happily termed agglutination, so as to form one word, conveying a complicated idea. There is also an elaborate system of in flection ; in nouns, for instance, there is one kind of inflection to express the presence or absence of vitality, and another to express number. The genius of the language has been described as ac cumulative ; it \" tends rather to add syllables or letters, making farther distinctions in objects already before the mind, than to introduce new words.'X88) Yet it has also been shown very dis tinctly, that these languages are based in words of one syllable, like those of the Chinese and Polynesian families; all the primary ideas are thus expressed: the elaborate system of inflec tion and agglutination is shown to be simply a"], [397, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 383 farther development of the language-forming principle, as it may be called \u2014 or the Chinese system may be described as an arrestment of this principle at a particular early point. It has been fully shown, that between the structure of the American and other families sufficient affinities exist to make a common origin or early con nexion extremely likely. The verbal affinities are also very considerable. Humboldt says, \" In eighty-three American languages examined by Messrs. Barton and Vater, one hundred and seventy7 words have been found, the roots of which appear to be the same ; and it is easy to perceive that this analogy is not accidental, since it does not rest merely upon imitative harmony7, or on that conformity of organs which produces almost a perfect identity in the first sounds articu lated by children. Of these one hundred ancl seventy words which have this connexion, three -fifths resemble the Manchou, the Tongouse, the Mon gol, and the Samoyed, and two-fifths, the Celtic and Tchoud, the Biscayan, the Coptic, and Congo languages. These words have been found by comparing the whole of the American languages with the whole of those of the Old World ; for hitherto we are acquainted with no American"], [398, "384 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. idiom which seems to have an exclusive corres pondence with any of the Asiatic, African, or European tongues. (89) Humboldt and others considered these words as brought into America by recent immigrants ; an idea resting on no proof, ancl which is much discountenanced by the common words being chiefly those which repre sent primary ideas ; besides, we now know, what was not formerly perceived or admitted, that there are great affinities of structure also. I may here refer to a curious mathematical calculation by Dr. Thomas Young, to the effect, that if three words coincide in two different languages, it is ten to one they must be derived in both cases from some parent language, or introduced in some other manner. \" Six words would give more,\" he says, \" than seventeen hundred to one, and eight near 1 00,000 ; so that in these cases the evidence would be little short of absolute certainty.\" He instances the following words to show a connexion between the ancient Egyptian and the Biscayan : Biscayan. Egyptian. New Beria .... Beri. A dug .... Ora. Whor. Little .... Gutchi .... Kudchi. Bread .... Ognia .... Oik. A wolf .... Otgsa .... Ounsh. Seven .... Shashpi .... Shashf."], [399, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 385 Now, as there are, according to Humboldt, one hundred and seventy words common to the languages of the new and old continents, and many of these are expressive of the most primi tive ideas, there is, by Dr. Young's calculation, overpowering proof of the original connexion of the American and other human families. It seems to me, after a full consideration of this kind of evidence, in connexion with the develop ment theory, that there is no reason to regard more than two local origins for the human race as necessary; namely, one for the Asiatic, Ame rican, and European varieties, and another for the African. The former seems to be connected with the great development of the quadrumana in southern Asia ; the latter, with that of western Africa. What is known of the migrations of the first group of races, and also their traditions, point to southern Asia as the scene of their origin. The lines of these migrations all converge, and are concentrated about the region of Hindostan. The language, religion, modes of reckoning time, and some other peculiar ideas of the Americans, are now believed to refer their origin to North- Eastern Asia. Trace them further back in the s"], [400, "386 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. same direction, and we come to the north of India. The history of the Celts and Teutones represents them as coming from the east, the one after the other, successive waves of a tide of population flowing towards the north-west of Europe : this line being also traced back, rests finally at the same place. So does the line of Iranian population, which has peopled the east and south shores of the Mediterranean, Syria, Arabia, and Egypt. The Malay variety, again, rests its limit in one direction on the borders of India. Standing on that point, it is easy to see how this great section of the human family, ori- ginating there, might spread out in different directions, passing into varieties of aspect and of language as they spread, the Malay variety proceeding towards the Oceanic region, the Mon- golians to the east and north, and sending off the red men as a sub- variety, the European po- pulation going off to the north-westward, and the Syrian, Arabian, and Egyptian, towards the countries which they are known to have so long occupied. The Negro alone is here unaccounted for; and that race is the one most likely to have had an independent origin, seeing that it is a type so peculiar in an inveterate black colour,"], [401, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 387 and so humble in development. The traditions of the first section exhibit an agreement with this view of its origin. There is one among the Hindoos which places the cradle of the human family in Thibet ; another makes Ceylon the resi dence of the first man. It is one of those things necessary to complete our view of the world as wholly under law, that civilization shoidd appear to be capable of arising in a natural manner. The tendency of the unin structed mind is to suppose supernatural causes for such phenomena, and there are even educated persons whose habits of thinking predispose them to take similar views. By one of these it has lately been argued, that facts are in favour of a supernatural origin for civdization. We see, says this authority, many examples of nations falling away from civdization into barbarism, while, in some regions of the earth, the history of which we do not clearly know, there are remains of works of art far superior to any which the present unen lightened inhabitants could have produced. The appearances are therefore in favour of a decline from some great and wide-spread civilization of early times. To this it may be answered, that these appearances are partial, compared with s 2"], [402, "388 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. what we know from history of an advance and an extension of civilization from early times. The decadences from civilization in such regions as Medea or Greece are only7 such local instances of failure or suppression as might be expected when civilization was cradled amidst nations generally barbarous, and who had an interest in attacking their wealthier neighbours. This, at least, were as legitimate an inference from the facts which are known. But it is also alleged that we know of no such thing as civilization being ever self originated. It is always seen to be imparted from one people to another. Hence, of course, we must infer that civilization at the first could only have been of supernatural origin. There again it may be answered \u2014 It is not to be ex pected that we should know of any of the ancient nations originating civilization amongst them selves, for history commences when they are already somewhat advanced in that course. As to the instances in which it has been seen to be imparted, these may be true, without necessarily implying that there was not a natural origin of civilization in some of the earlier nations. It may be questioned, however, if these instances are in themselves true. The efforts made to trace"], [403, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 389 the civilization of Central America to Egypt and other countries have all signally failed. There is even a fallacy in supposing that, because Greece, for example, obtained certain kinds of knowledge and forms of art from Egypt, its whole civilization was descended from that and similar quarters. There are characteristic features in all civdiza tions which support the idea that they are usually for the most part original. There is not only this peculiarity, but there is an isolatedness in some civilizations, which tallies much better with the theory of their independent than their imparted origin. When it is said that civilization is never seen to arise without aid from external sources, an affirmation is made on very imperfect grounds. It appears that civilization does sometimes rise in a manner clearly independent amongst a horde of people generally barbarous. A striking instance is described in the laborious work of Mr. Catlin on the North-American tribes. Far placed among those which inhabit the vast region of the north west, and quite beyond the reach of any* influence from the whites, he found a small tribe living in a fortified village, where they cultivated the arts of manufacture, realized comforts and luxuries, and had attained to a remarkable refinement of"], [404, "390 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. manners, insomuch as to be generally called \" the polite and friendly Mandans.\" They were also more than usually elegant in their persons, and of every variety of complexion between that of their compatriots and a pure white. Up to the time of Mr. Catlin's visit, these people had been able to defend themselves and their possessions against the roving bands which surrounded them on all sides ; but, soon after, they were attacked by small-pox, which cut them all off except a small party, whom their enemies rushed in upon and destroyed to a man. What is this but a repetition on a small scale, of phenomena with which ancient history familiarizes us \u2014 a nation rising in arts and elegancies amidst barbarous neighbours, but at length overpowered by the rude majority, leaving only a Tadmor or a Luxor as a monument of itself to beautify the waste ? What can we suppose the nation which built Palenque and Copan to have been but only a kind of Mandan tribe, which chanced to have made its way further along the path of civilization and the arts, before the barbarians broke in upon it ? The flame essayed to rise in many parts of the earth; but there were strong agencies working against it, and down it accordingly went, times"], [405, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 391 without number ; yet there was always a vitality in it, nevertheless, and a tendency to progress, and at length it seems to have attained a strength against which the powers of barbarism can never more prevail. The state of our knowledge of un civilized nations is very apt to make us fall into error on this subject. They are generally sup posed to be all at one point in barbarism, which is far from being the case, for in the midst of every great region of uncivilized men, such as North America, there are nations partially re fined. The Jolofs, Mandingoes, and Kafirs, are African examples, where a natural and inde pendent origin for the improvement which exists is as unavoidably to be presumed as in the case of the Mandans^90) The most conclusive argument against the ori ginal civilization of mankind is to be found in the fact that we do not now see civilization existing anywhere except in certain conditions altogether different from any we can suppose to have existed at the commencement of our race. To have civi lization, it is necessary that a people should be numerous and closely placed ; that they should be fixed in their habitations, and safe from violent external and internal disturbance ; that a con-"], [406, "392 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. siderable number of them should be exempt from the necessity of drudging for immediate sub sistence. Feeling themselves at ease about the first necessities of their nature, including self preservation, and daily subjected to that intel lectual excitement which society produces, men begin to manifest what is called civilization ; but never in rude and shelterless circumstances, or when widely scattered. Even civilized men, when transferred to a wide wilderness, wiiere each has to work hard and isolatedly for the first requisites of life, soon show a retrogression to barbarism : witness the plains of Australia, as well as the backwoods of Canada and the prairies of Texas. Fixity of residence and thickening of population are perhaps the prime requisites for civilization, and hence it will be found that all civilizations as yet known have taken place in regions physically limited. That of Egypt arose in a narrow valley hemmed in by deserts on both sides. That of Greece took its rise in a small peninsula bounded on the only land side by mountains. Etruria and Rome were naturally limited regions. Civilizations have taken place at both the eastern and western extremities of the elder continent\u2014 China and Japan, on the"], [407, "393 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. one hand; Germany, Holland, Britain, France, on the other, \u2014 whde the great unmarked tract between contains nations decidedly less ad- vanced. Why is this, but because the sea in both cases has imposed limits to further migra- tion, and caused the population to settle and condense? \u2014 the conditions most necessary for social improvements1) Even the simple case of the Mandans affords an illustration of this prin- ciple ; for Mr. Catlin expressly, though without the least regard to theory, attributes their im- provement to the fact of their being a small tribe, obliged, by fear of their more numerous enemies, to settle in a permanent village, so fortified as to ensure their preservation. \" By this means,\" says he, \" they have advanced further in the arts of manufacture, and have supplied their lodges more abundantly with the comforts and even luxuries of life than any Indian nation I know of. The consequence of this,\" he adds, \" is, that the tribe have taken many steps ahead of other tribes in manners and refinements.\" These conditions can only be regarded as natural laws affecting civilization. It is also necessary for a civilization that at least a portion of the community should be placed above mean and engrossing toils. s 3"], [408, "394 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. Man's mind is subdued, like the dyer's hand, to that it works in. In rude and difficult circum stances, we unavoidably become rude, because then only the inferior and harsher faculties of our nature are called into exercise. When, on the contrary, there is leisure and abundance, the self seeking and self-preserving instincts are allowed to rest, the gentler and more generous sentiments are evoked, and man becomes that courteous and chivalric being which he is found to be amongst the upper classes of almost all civilized countries. These, then, may be said to be the chief natural laws concerned in the moral phenomenon of civi lization. If I am right in so considering them, it will, of course, be readily admitted that the earliest families of the human race, although they might be simple and innocent, could not have been in anything like a civilized state, seeing that the conditions necessary for that state could not have then existed. Let us only for a moment consider some of the things requisite for their being civilized, \u2014 namely, a set of elegant homes ready furnished for their reception, fields, ready cultivated to yield them food without labour, stores of luxurious appliances of all kinds, a complete social enginery for the securing of life"], [409, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 395 and property, \u2014 and we shall turn from the whole conceit as one worthy only of the uninstructed mind. Yet, as has been remarked, the earliest famdies might be simple and innocent, while at the same time unskilled and ignorant, and obliged to live upon only those substances which they could readily procure. The traditions of all nations refer to such a state as that in which mankind were at first : perhaps it is not so much a tradi- tion as an idea which the human mind naturally inclines to form respecting the fathers of the race; but nothing that we see of mankind absolutely forbids our entertaining this idea, while there are some considerations rather favourable to it. A few families, in a state of nature, living near each other, in a country supplying the means of sub- sistence abundantly, are generally simple and innocent ; their instinctive and perceptive facul- ties are also apt to be active, although the higher intellect may be dormant. If we therefore pre- sume India to have been the cradle of the prin- cipal portion of our race, they might at first ex- emplify a kind of golden age ; but it could not be of long continuance.

The causes of the various external peculiarities of mankind now require some attention. Why, it is asked, are the Africans black, and generally marked by ungainly forms ; why the flat features of the Chinese, and the comparatively well-formed figures of the Caucasians ? Why the Mongo lians generally yellow, the Americans red, and the Caucasians white ? These questions were complete puzzles to all early writers; but physio logy has lately thrown a great light upon them. It is now shown that the brain, after completing the series of animal transformations, passes through the characters in which it appears in the Negro, Malay, American, and Mongolian nations, and finally becomes Caucasian. The face par takes of these alterations. \" One of the earliest points in which ossification commences is the lower jaw. This bone is consequently sooner completed than the other bones of the head, and acquires a predominance, which, as is well known, it never loses in the Negro. During the soft, pliant state of the bones of the skull, the oblong form which they naturally assume, approaches"], [411, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 397 nearly the permanent shape of the Americans. At birth, the flattened face, and broad smooth forehead of the infant, the position of the eyes rather towards the side of the head, and the widened space between, represent the Mongolian form ; while it is only as the child advances to maturity, that the oval face, the arched forehead, and the marked features of the true Caucasian, become perfectly developed.\" (9!) The leading characters, in short, of the various races of mankind, are simply representations of particular stages in the development of the highest or Caucasian type. The Negro exhibits permanently the imperfect brain, projecting lower jaw, and slender bent limbs, of a Caucasian child, some considerable time before the period of its birth. The aboriginal American represents the same child nearer birth. The Mongolian is an arrested infant newly born. And so forth. All this is as respects form;(93) but whence colour ? This might be supposed to have depended on climatal agencies only; but it has been shown by overpowering evidence to be in dependent of these. In further considering the matter, we are met by the very remarkable fact that colour is deepest in the least perfectly developed type, next in the Malay, next in the"], [412, "398 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. American, next in the Mongolian, the very order in which the degrees of development are ranged. May not colour, then, depend upon development also? We do not, indeed, see that a Caucasian foetus at the stage which the African represents is black ; neither is a Caucasian chdd yellow, like the Mon- golian. But the case of a Caucasian foetus, or child, at any of its stages of development, is dif- ferent from that of a being whose mature form only7 comes up to the same point. When a being is presented, who at full time has only attained a point of formation such as the Caucasian passed at a comparatively early stage of this embryotic history, there may be a character of skin liable to a certain tinting on being exposed. Development being arrested at so immature a stage in the case of the Negro, the skin may take on the colour as an unavoidable consequence of its imperfect organization. It is favourable to this view, that Negro infants are not deeply black at first, but only acquire the full colour after exposure for some time to the atmosphere ; also that the parts of the body concealed by clothing are not gene rally of so deep a hue as the face and hands. The phenomenon, in short, appears identical in character with the photographic process; not a"], [413, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 399 result of the action of heat, as has been so long blunderingly supposed, but of light ! It takes its place under the infant science of actino-chemistry, to which, perhaps, many other remarkable pheno mena connected with the natural history of our race will yet be referred. This view, seeming to account for all the varieties of mankind as only the result of so many gradations in the develop ing power of the human mothers, is favourable to the doctrine of one origin ; but it cannot be con sidered as settling the question, seeing that sepa rate developments may have attained various points in the scale of the human organization \u2014 as one of the pachydermatous lines has reached the full equine form in Asia, but only the com paratively* humble quagga in Africa. We have seen that the traces of a common origin in all languages afford a ground of pre sumption for the unity of at least the principal portion of the human race. They establish a still stronger probabdity that that portion of mankind had not yet begun to disperse before they were possessed of a means of communicating their ideas by conventional sounds \u2014 in short, speech. This is a gift so peculiar to man, and in itself so remarkable, that there is a great inclination"], [414, "400 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. to surmise a miraculous origin for it, although there is no proper ground, or even support, for such an idea in Scripture, while it is clearly opposed to everything else we know with regard to the providential arrangements for the creation of our race. Here, as in other cases, a little observation of nature might have saved much vain discussion. The real character of language itself has not been thoroughly understood. Lan guage, in its most comprehensive sense, is the communication of ideas by whatever means. Ideas can be communicated by looks, gestures, and signs of various other kinds, as well as by speech. The inferior animals possess some of those means of communicating ideas, and they have likewise a silent and unobservable mode of their own, the nature of which is a complete mystery to us, though we are assured of its reality by its effects. Now, as the inferior animals were all in being before man, there was language upon earth long ere the history of our race commenced. The only additional fact in the history of lan guage, which was produced by our creation, was the rise of a new mode of expression \u2014 namely, that by sound-signs produced by the vocal organs. In other words, speech was the only novelty in"], [415, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 401 this respect attending the creation of the human race. No doubt it was an addition of great im portance, for, in comparison with it, the other natural modes of communicating ideas are insig nificant. Still, the main and fundamental phe nomenon, language, as the communication of ideas, was no new gift of the Creator to man ; and in speech itself, when we judge of it as a natural fact, we see only a result of some of those supe rior endowments of which so many others have fallen to our lot through the medium of a superior organization. The first and most obvious natural endowment concerned in speech is that peculiar organization of the lary7nx, trachea, and mouth, which enables us to produce the various sounds required. Man started at first with this organization ready for use, a constitution of the atmosphere adapted for the sounds which that organization was calculated to produce, and, lastly, but not leastly7, a mental power prompting to, and giving directions for, the expression of ideas. Such an arrangement of mutually adapted things was as likely to pro duce sounds as an Eolian harp placed in a draught is to give forth tones. It was un avoidable that human beings so organized, and"], [416, "402 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. in such a relation to external nature, should utter sounds, and also come to attach to these conven tional meanings, thus forming the elements of spoken language. The great difficulty which has been felt is to account for man going in this respect beyond the inferior animals. There could have been no such difficulty, if speculators in this class of subjects had looked into physiology for an account of the superior vocal organization of man, and had they obtained a true science of mind to show man possessing a faculty for the expression of ideas which is only rudimental in the lower animals. Another difficulty has been in the consideration that, if men were at first utterly untutored and barbarous, they could scarcely be in a condition to form or employ language \u2014 an instrument which it requires the fullest powers of thought to analyze and spe culate upon. This difficulty comes strangely from those who can see none in the miraculous imparting of a full vocabulary to beings as yet possessing but a portion of the ideas which an entire language represents. But, in reality, it is not necessary to suppose the fathers of our race as early attaining to great proficiency in language, and, in the second, language itself seems to be"], [417, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 403 amongst the things least difficult to be acquired, if we can form any judgment from what we see in children, most of whom have, by three years of age, while their information and judgment are still as nothing, mastered and familiarized them selves with a quantity of words, infinitely ex ceeding in proportion what they acquire in the course of any subsequent similar portion of time. Discussions as to which parts of speech were first formed, and the processes by which gram matical structure and inflections took their rise, appear in a great measure needless, after the matter has been placed in this light. The mental powers could readily connect particular arbitrary sounds with particular ideas, whether those ideas were nouns, verbs, or interjections. As the words of all languages can be traced back into roots which are monosyllables, we may presume these sounds to have all been monosyllabic accordingly. The clustering of two or more together to express a compound idea, and the formation of inflections by additional syllables expressive of pronouns and such prepositions as of, by, and to, are pro cesses which would or might occur as matters of course, being simple results of a mental power called into action, and partly directed, by ex-"], [418, "404 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. ternal necessities. This power, however, as we find it in very different degrees of endowment in individuals, so would it be in different degrees of endowment in nations, or branches of the human family. Hence we find the formation of words, ancl the process of their composition and gram matical arrangement, in very different stages of development in different races. The Chinese have a language composed of a limited number of monosyllables, which they multiply in use by mere variations of accent, and which they have never yet attained the power of clustering or inflecting ; the language of this immense nation \u2014 the third part of the human race \u2014 may be said to be in the condition of infancy. The aboriginal Americans, so inferior in civilization, have, on the other hand, a language of the most elaborately composite kind, perhaps even exceeding, in this respect, the languages of the most refined Euro pean nations. These are but a few out of many facts tending to show that language is in a great measure independent of civilization, as far as its advance and development are concerned. Do they not also help to prove that cultivated in tellect is not necessary for the origination of language ?"], [419, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 405 Facts daily presented to our observation afford equally simple reasons for the almost infinite diversification of language. It is invariably found that, wherever society is at once dense and re fined, language tends to be uniform throughout the whole population, and to undergo few changes in the course of time. Wherever, on the con trary, we have a scattered and barbarous people, we have great diversities, and comparatively* rapid alterations of language ; insomuch that, while English, French, and German, are each spoken with little variation by many millions, there are islands in the Indian archipelago, probably not inhabited by one million, but in which there are hundreds of languages as diverse, as are English, French, and German. It is easy to see how this should be. There are peculiarities in the vocal organization of every person, tending to produce peculiarities of pronunciation : for example, it has been stated that each child in a family of six gave the monosyllable, fly, in a different manner, (eye, fy, ly, &c.) until, when the organs were more advanced, correct example induced the proper pronunciation of this and similar words. Such departures from orthoepy are only to be checked by the power of example ; but this is a"], [420, "406 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. power not always present, or not always of suffi cient strength. The self-devoted Robert Moffat, in his work on South Africa, states, without tbe least regard to hypothesis, that amongst the people of the towns of that great region, \" the purity and harmony of language is kept up by their pitchos or public meetings, by their festivals and ceremonies, as well as by their songs and their constant intercourse. With the isolated villages of the desert it is far otherwise. They have no such meetings ; they are compelled to traverse the wilds, often to a great distance from their native village. On such occasions, fathers and mothers, and all who can bear a burden, often set out for weeks at a time, and leave their children to the care of two or three infirm old people. The infant progeny, some of whom are beginning to lisp, while others can just master a whole sentence, and those still further advanced, romping and playing together, the children of nature, through the live-long day, become habi tuated to a language of their own. The more voluble condescend to the less precocious, and thus, from this infant Babel, proceeds a dialect composed of a host of mongrel words and phrases, joined together without rule, and in the"], [421, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 407 course of a generation the entire character of the language is changed.\" (u) I have been told, that in like manner the children of the Manchester factory workers, left for a great part of the day, in large assemblages, under the care of perhaps a single elderly person, and spending the time in amusements, are found to make a great deal of new language. I have seen children in other cir cumstances amuse themselves by concocting and throwing into the family circulation entirely new words ; and I believe I am running little risk of contradiction when I say that tbere is scarcely a family, even amongst the middle classes of this country, who have not some peculiarities of pro nunciation and syntax, which have originated amongst themselves, it is hardly possible to say how. All these things being considered, it is easy to understand how mankind have come at length to possess between three and four thou sand languages, all different at least as much as French, German, and English, though, as has been shown, resemblances suggesting a common origin are observable in most of them. What has been said on the question whether mankind were originally barbarous or civilized, will have prepared the reader for understanding"], [422, "408 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. how the arts and sciences, and the rudiments of civilization itself, took their rise amongst men. The only source of fallacious views on this sub ject is the so frequent observation of arts, sciences, and social modes, forms, and ideas, being not indigenous where we see them now flourishing, but known to have been derived elsewhere : thus Rome borrowed from Greece, Greece from Egypt, and Egypt itself, lost in the mists of historic anti quity, is now supposed to have obtained the light of knowledge from some still earlier scene of in tellectual culture. This has caused to many a great difficulty in supposing a natural or spon taneous origin for civilization and the attendant arts. But, in the first place, several stages of derivation are no conclusive argument against there having been an originality at some earlier stage. In the second, such observers have not looked far enough, for, if they had, they might have seen various instances of civilizations which it is impossible, with any plausibility, to trace back to a common origin with others ; such are those of China and America. They would also have seen civilization springing up, as it were, like oases amongst the arid plains of barbarism, as in the case of the Mandans. A still more"], [423, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 409 attentive study of the subject would have shown, amongst living men, the very psychological pro cedure on which the origination of civilization and the arts and sciences depended. These things, like language, are simply the effects of the spontaneous working of certain mental faculties, each in relation to the things of the external world on which it was intended by creative Providence to be exercised. The monkeys themselves, without instruction from any quarter, learn to use sticks in fighting, and some budd houses \u2014 an act whioh cannot in their case be considered as one of instinct, but of intelligence. Such being the case, there is no ne cessary difficulty in supposing how man, with his superior mental organization, (a brain five times heavier,) was able, in his primitive state, without instruction, to turn many things in nature to his use, and commence, in short, the circle of the domestic arts. He appears, in the most unfa vourable circumstances, to be able to provide himself with some sort of dwelling, to make weapons, and to practise some simple kind of cookery. But, granting, it will be said, that he can go thus far, how does he ever proceed further unprompted, seeing that many nations remain T"], [424, "410 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. fixed for ever at this point, and seem unable to take one step in advance ? It is perfectly true that there is such a fixation in many nations ; but, on the other hand, all nations are not alike in mental organization, and another point has been established, that only when some favourable cir- cumstances have settled a people in one place, do arts and social arrangements get leave to flourish. If we were to limit our view to humbly endowed nations, or the common class of minds in those called civilized, we should see absolutely no con- ceivable power for the origination of new ideas and devices. But let us look at the inventive class of minds which stand out amongst their fellows \u2014 the men, who, with little prompting or none, conceive new ideas in science, arts, morals \u2014 and we can be at no loss to understand how and whence have arisen the elements of that civilization which history traces from country to country throughout the course of centuries. See a Pascal reproducing the Alexandrian's problems at fifteen ; a Ferguson making clocks from the suggestions of his own brain, while tending cattle on a Morayshire heath ; a boy Lawrence, in an inn on the Bath road, producing, without a master, drawings which the educated could not"], [425, "EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. 411 but admire ; or look at Solon and Confucius, de vising sage laws, and breathing the accents of all but divine wisdom, for their barbarous fellow countrymen, three thousand years ago \u2014 and the whole mystery is solved at once. Amongst the arrangements of Providence is one for the pro duction of original, inventive, and aspiring minds, which, when circumstances are not decidedly un favourable, strike out new ideas for the benefit of their fellow-creatures, or put upon them a lasting impress of their own superior sentiments. Na tions, improved by these means, become in turn foci for the diffusion of light over the adjacent regions of barbarism \u2014 their very passions helping to this end, for nothing can be more clear, than that ambitious aggression has led to the civili zation of many countries. Such is the process which seems to form the destined means for bringing mankind from the darkness of barbarism to the day of knowledge and mechanical and social improvement. Even the noble art of letters is but, as Dr. Adam Ferguson has remarked, \" a natural produce of the human mind, which will rise spontaneously, wherever men are happily placed ;\" original alike amongst the ancient Egyptians and the dimly monumented Toltecans T 2"], [426, "412 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. of Yucatan. \" Banish,\" says Dr. Gall, \" music, poetry7, painting, sculpture, architecture, all the arts and sciences, and let your Homers, Raphaels, Michael Angelos, Glucks, and Canovas, be for gotten, yet let men of genius of every description spring up, and poetry, music, painting, architec ture, sculpture, and all the arts and sciences, will again shine out in all their glory. Twice within the records of history has the human race tra versed the great circle of its entire destiny, and twice has the rudeness of barbarism been followed by a higher degree of refinement. It is a great mistake to suppose one people to have proceeded from another on account of their conformity of manners, customs, and arts. The swallow of Paris builds its nest like the swallow of Vienna, but does it thence follow that the former sprung from the latter ? With the same causes we have the same effects ; with the same organization we have the manifestation of the same powers.\""], [427, "413 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. No clear ideas have as yet been entertained by7 the generality of even educated men, with regard to the mental constitution of animals. The very nature of this constitution is not as yet generally known or held as ascertained. There is, indeed, a notion of old standing, that the mind is in some way connected with the brain ; but the metaphy sicians insist that it is, in reality, known only by its acts or effects, and they accordingly present the subject in a form which is unlike any other kind of science, for it does not so much as pretend to have a basis in nature. There is a general disinclination to regard mind in con nexion with organization, from a fear that this must interfere with the cherished religious doc-"], [428, "414 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. trine of the spirit of man, and lower him to the level of the brutes. A distinction is therefore drawn between our mental manifestations and those of the lower animals, the latter being com prehended under the term instinct, while ours are collectively described as mind, mind being again a received synonyme with soul, the immortal part of man. There is here a strange system of con fusion and error, which it is most imprudent to regard as essential to religion, since candid inves tigations of nature tend to show its untenableness. There is, in reality, nothing to prevent our re garding man as being specially, in accordance with his position as the head or chief of all animals, endowed with an immortal spirit, at the same time that his ordinary mental mani festations are looked upon as simple phenomena resulting from organization, those of the lower animals being phenomena absolutely the same in character, though developed within narrower limits. (95) What has chiefly tended to take mind, in the eyes of learned and unlearned, out of the range of nature, is its apparently irregular and wayward character. How different the manifestations in different beings! how unstable in all !\u2014 at one"], [429, "MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. 415 time so calm, at another so wild and impulsive ! It seemed impossible that anything so subtle and aberrant could be part of a system, the main fea- tures of which are regularity and precision. But the irregularity of mental phenomena is only in appearance. When we give up the individual, and take the mass, we find as much uniformity of result as in any other class of natural phenomena. The irregularity is exactly of the same kind as that of the weather. No man can say what may be the weather of to-morrow ; but the quantity of rain which falls in any particular place in any five years is precisely7 the same as the quantity which falls in any other five y*ears at the same place. Thus, while it is absolutely impossible to predict of any one Frenchman that during next year he wdl commit a crime, it is quite certain that about one in every six hundred and fifty of the French people will do so, because in past years the proportion has generally been about that amount, the tendencies to crime in relation to the temptations being everywhere invariable over a sufficiently wide range of time. So also, the number of persons taken in charge by the police in London for being drunk and disorderly in the streets, is, w7eek by week, a nearly uniform"], [430, "416 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. quantity7, showing that the inclination to drink to excess is always in the mass about the same, regard being had to the existing temptations or stimulations to this vice. Even mistakes and oversights are of regular recurrence, for it is found, in the post-offices of large cities, that the number of letters put in without addresses is year by year the same. Statistics has ascertained an equally distinct regularity in a wide range, with regard to many other things concerning the mind, and the doctrine founded upon it has lately produced a scheme which may well strike tbe ignorant with surprise. It was proposed to establish in London a society for ensuring tbe integrity of clerks, secretaries, collectors, and all such functionaries as are usually obliged to find security for money passing through their hands in the course of business. A gentleman of the highest character as an actuary spoke of the plan in the following terms : \u2014 \" If a thousand bankers' clerks were to club together to indemnify their securities, by the payment of one pound a year each, and if each had given security for 500Z., it is obvious that two in each year might become defaulters to that amount, four to half the amount, and so on, with out rendering the guarantee fund insolvent. If it"], [431, "417 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. be tolerably well ascertained that the instances of dishonesty (yearly) among such persons amount to one in five hundred, this club would continue to exist, subject to being in debt in a bad year, to an amount which it would be able to discharge in good ones. The only7 question necessary to be asked previous to the formation of such a club would be, \u2014 may it not be feared that the motive to resist dishonesty would be lessened by the existence of the club, or that ready-made rogues, by belonging to it, might find the means of obtaining situations which they would otherwise have been kept out of by the impossibility of obtaining security among those who know them ? Suppose this be sufficiently answered by saying, that none but those who could bring satisfactory testimony to their previous good character should be allowed to join the club; that persons who may now hope that a deficiency on their parts will be made up and hushed up by the relative or friend who is security, will know very well that the club will have no motive to decline a prosecu tion, or to keep the secret, and so on. It then only remains to ask, whether the sum demanded for the guarantee is sufficient ?\"(96) The philoso phical principle on which the scheme proceeds, t 3"], [432, "418 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. seems to be simply this, that amongst a given (large) number of persons of good character, there will be, within a year or other considerable space of time, a determinate number of instances in which moral principle and the terror of the consequences of guilt will be overcome by tempta tions of a determinate kind and amount, and thus occasion a certain periodical amount of loss whicii the association must make up. This statistical regularity in moral affairs fully establishes their being under the presidency of law. Man is seen to be an enigma only as an individual; in the mass he is a mathematical problem. It is hardly necessary to say, much less to argue, that mental action, being proved to be under law, passes at once into the category of natural things. Its old metaphysical character vanishes in a moment, and the distinction usually taken between physical and moral is annulled. This view agrees with what all observation teaches, that mental phenomena flow directly from the brain. They are seen to be dependent on naturally constituted and naturally condi tioned organs, and thus obedient, like all other organic phenomena, to law. And how w*ondrous must the constitution of this apparatus be, which"], [433, "MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. 419 gives us consciousness of thought and of affection, which makes us familiar with the numberless things of earth, and enables us to rise in concep tion and communion to the councils of God himself! It is matter which forms the medium or instrument \u2014 a little mass which, decomposed, is but so much common dust ; yet in its living constitution, designed, formed, and sustained by Almighty Wisdom, how admirable its character ! how reflective of the unutterable depths of that Power by which it was so formed, and is so sustained ! In the mundane economy, mental action takes its place as a means of providing for the inde pendent existence and the various relations of animals, each species being furnished according to its special necessities and the demands of its various relations. The nervous system \u2014 the more comprehensive term for its organic appa ratus \u2014 is variously developed in different classes and species, and also in different individuals, the volume or mass bearing a general relation to the amount of power. Passing over the humblest orders, where nervous apparatus is so obscure as hardly to be traceable, we see it in the nemato neura of Owen,(97) in filaments and nuclei, the"], [434, "420 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. mere rudiments of the system. In the articulata, it is advanced to a double nervous cord, with ganglia or little masses of nervous matter at fre quent intervals, and filaments branching out to wards each side ; the ganglia near the head being apparently those which send out nerves to the organs of the senses ; and this arrangement is only less symmetrical in the mollusca. Ascend ing to the vertebrata, we find a spinal cord, with a brain at the upper extremity, and numerous branching lines of nervous tissue, (\") an organiza tion strikingly superior ; yet here, as in the general structure of animals, the great principle of unity is observed. The brain of the vertebrata is merely an expansion of the anterior pair of the ganglia of the articulata, or these ganglia may be regarded as the rudiment of a brain, the superior organ thus appearing as only a further develop ment of the inferior. There are many facts which tend to prove that the action of this apparatus is of an electric nature, a modification of that sur prising agent, which takes magnetism, heat, and light, as other subordinate forms, and of whose general scope in this great system of things we are only beginning to have a faint conception."], [435, "MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. 421 It has been found that simple electricity, artifi cially produced, and sent along the nerves of a dead body, excites muscular movement. The brain of a newly-killed animal being taken out, and replaced by a substance which produces electric action, the operation of digestion, which had been interrupted by the death of the animal, was resumed, showing that the brain, in one of its capacities or powers, is identical with the gal vanic battery. Nor is this a very startling idea, when we reflect that electricity is almost as meta physical as ever mind was supposed to be. It is a thing perfectly intangible, weightless. A mass of metal may be magnetized, or heated to seven hundred of Fahrenheit, without becoming the hundredth part of a grain heavier. And yet electricity is a real thing, an actual existence in nature, as witness the effects of heat and light in vegetation \u2014 the power of the galvanic current to re-assemble the particles of copper from a solu tion, and make them again into a solid plate \u2014 the rending force of the thunderbolt as it strikes the oak. See also how both heat and light observe the angle of incidence in reflection, as exactly as does a stone thrown obliquely against a wall. So"], [436, "422 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. mental action may be imponderable, intangible, and yet a real existence, and ruled by the Eternal through his laws.(\") Common observation shows a great general superiority of the human mind over that of the inferior animals. Man's mind is almost infinite in device ; it ranges over all the world ; it forms the most wonderful combinations ; it seeks back into the past, and stretches forward into the future ; while the animals generally appear to have a narrow range of thought and action. But so also has an infant but a limited range, and yet it is mind which works there, as well as in the most accomplished adults. The difference be- tween mind in the lower animals and in man is a difference in degree only; it is not a specific difference. All who have studied animals by actual observation, and even those who have given a candid attention to the subject in books, must attain more or less clear convictions of this truth, notwithstanding all the obscurity which pre judice may have engendered. We see animals capable of affection, jealousy, envy ; we see them quarrel, and conduct quarrels in the very manner pursued by the ruder and less educated of our own race. We see them liable to flattery, inflated"], [437, "423 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. with pride, and dejected by7 shame. We see them as tender to their young as human parents are, and as faithful to a trust as the most conscien tious of human servants. The horse is startled by marvellous objects, as a man is. The dog and many others show tenacious memory. The dog also proves himself possessed of imagination, by the act of dreaming. Horses, finding themselves in want of a shoe, have of their own accord gone to a farrier's shop where they were shod before. Cats closed up in rooms, will endeavour to obtain their liberation by pulling a latch or ringing a bell. A monkey7, wishing to get into a particular tree, and seeing a dangerous snake at the bottom of it, watched for hours till he found the reptile for a moment off its guard; he sprang upon it, and, seizing it by the neck, bruised its head to pieces against a stone ; after which he quietly7 ascended the tree. We can hardly doubt that the animal seized and bruised the head, because he knew or judged there was danger in that part. It has several times been observed that in a field of cattle, when one or two were mischiev ous, and persisted long in annoying or tyranniz ing over the rest, the herd, to all appearance, con sulted, and then, making a united effort, drove the"], [438, "424 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. troublers off the ground. The members of a rookery have also been observed to take turns in supplying the needs of a family reduced to orphanhood. All of these are acts of reason, in no respect different from similar acts of men. Moreover, although there is no heritage of accu mulated knowledge amongst the lower animals, as there is amongst us, they are in some degree susceptible of those modifications of natural cha racter, and capable of those accomplishments, which we call education. The taming and domes tication of animals, and the changes thus pro duced upon their nature in the course of gene rations, are results identical with civilization amongst ourselves ; and the quiet, servile steer is probably as unlike the original wild cattle of this country, as the English gentleman of the present day* is unlike tbe rude baron of the age of King John. Between a young, unbroken horse, and a trained one, there is, again, all the difference which exists between a wild youth reared at his own discretion in the country, and the same person when he has been toned down by long exposure to the influences of refined city society. Of extensive combinations of thought we have no reason to believe that any animals are capable \u2014"], [439, "425 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. and yet most of us must feel the force of Walter Scott's remark, that there was scarcely anything which he would not believe of a dog. There is a curious result of education in certain animals, namely7, that habits to which they7 have been trained, in some instances become hereditary7. For example, the accomplishment of pointing at game, although a pure result of education, ap pears in the young pups brought up apart from their parents and kind. The peculiar leap of the Irish horse, acquired in the course of traversing a boggy country, is continued in the progeny brought up in England. This hereditariness of specific habits suggests a relation to that form of psychological manifestation usually called in stinct ; but instinct is only another term for mind, or is mind in a peculiar stage of development ; ancl though the fact were otherwise, it could not affect the conclusion, that manifestations such as have been enumerated are mainly intellectual manifestations, not to be distinguished as such from those of human beings. More than this, the lower animals manifested mental phenomena long before man existed. While as yet there was no brain capable of work ing out a mathematical problem, the economy of"], [440, "426 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. the six sided figure was exemplified by the in stinct of the bee. The dog and the elephant pre figured the sagacity of the human mind. The love of a human mother for her babe was anti cipated by nearly every humbler mammal, the carnaria not excepted. The peacock strutted, the turkey7 blustered, and the cock fought for victory, just as human beings afterwards did, and still do. Om* faculty7 of imitation, on which so much of our amusement depends, was exercised by the mock ing-bird ; and the whole tribe of monkeys must have walked about the pre-human world, playing off those tricks in which we see the comicality and mischief-making of our character so curiously exaggerated. The unity and simplicity which characterize nature give great antecedent probability to what observation seems about to establish, that, as the brain of the vertebrata generally is only an ad vanced condition of a particular ganglion in the mollusca and Crustacea, so are the brains of the higher and more intelligent mammalia only fur ther developments of the brains of the inferior orders of the same class. Or, to the same pur pose, it may be said, that each species has certain superior developments, according to its needs,"], [441, "MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. 427 while others are in a rudimental or repressed state. This will more clearly appear after some inquiry has been made into the various powers comprehended under the term mind. One of the first and simplest functions of mind is to give consciousness \u2014 consciousness of our identity and of om* existence. This, apparently7, is independent of the senses, which are simply media, and, as Locke has shown, the only media, through which ideas respecting the external world reach the brain. The access of such ideas to the brain is the act to which the metaphysicians have given the name of perception. Gall, however, has shown, by induction from a vast number of actual cases, that there is a part of the brain de voted to perception, and that even this is sub divided into portions which are respectively dedi cated to the reception of different sets of ideas, as those of form, size, colour, weight, objects in their totality, events in their progress or occur rence, time, musical sounds, etc. The system of mind invented by this philosopher \u2014 the only one founded upon nature, or which even pretends to or admits of that necessary basis \u2014 shows a por tion of the brain acting as a faculty of comic ideas, another of imitation, another of wonder,"], [442, "428 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. one for discriminating or observing differences, and another in which resides the power of tracing effects to causes. There are also districts of the brain for the sentimental part of our nature, or the affections, at the head of which stand the moral feelings of benevolence, conscientiousness, and veneration. Through these, man stands in relation to himself, his fellow-men, the external world, and his God ; ancl through these comes most of the happiness of man's life, as well as that which he derives from the contemplation of the world to come, and the cultivation of his rela- tion to it, (pure religion.) The other sentiments may be briefly enumerated, their names being sufficient in general to denote their functions \u2014 firmness, hope, cautiousness, self-esteem, love of approbation, secretiveness, marvellousness, con- structiveness, imitation, combativeness, destruc tiveness, concentrativeness, adhesiveness, love of the opposite sex, love of offspring, alimentive ness, and love of life. Through these faculties, man is connected with the external world, and supplied with active impulses to maintain his place in it as an individual and as a species. There is also a faculty, (language,) for express ing, by whatever means, (signs, gestures, looks,"], [443, "MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. 429 conventional terms in speech,) the ideas which arise in the mind. There is a particular state of each of these faculties, when the ideas of objects once formed by it are revived or reproduced, a process which seems to be intimately allied with some of the phenomena of photography, when images impressed by reflection of the sun's rays upon sensitive paper are, after a temporary obli teration, resuscitated on the sheet being exposed to the fumes of mercury. Such are the pheno mena of memory, that handmaid of intellect, without which there could be no accumulation of mental capital, but an universal and continual in fancy. Conception and imagination appear to be only intensities, so to speak, of the state of brain in which memory is produced. On their promptness and power depend most of the exer tions which distinguish the man of arts and letters, and even in no small measure the culti vator of science. The faculties above described \u2014 the actual ele ments of the mental constitution \u2014 are seen in mature man in an indefinite potentiality and range of action. It is different with the lower animals. They are there comparatively definite in their power and restricted in their application."], [444, "430 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. The reader is familiar with what are called in stincts in some of the humbler species, that is, an uniform and unprompted tendency towards cer tain particular acts, as the building of cells by the bee, tbe storing of provisions by that insect and several others, and the construction of nests for a coming progeny by birds. This quality is no thing more than a mode of operation peculiar to the faculties in a humble state of endowment, or early stage of development. The cell-formation of the bee, the house-building of ants and beavers, the web-spinning of spiders, are but primitive exercises of constructiveness, the faculty which, indefinite with us, leads to the arts of the weaver, upholsterer, architect, and mechanist, and makes us often work delightedly where our labours are in vain, or nearly so. The storing of provision by the bees is an exercise of acquisitiveness, \u2014 a faculty which with us makes rich men and misers. A vast number of curious devices, by which in sects provide for the protection and subsistence of tbeir young, whom they are perhaps never to see, are most probably a peculiar restricted effort of philo-progenitiveness. The common source of this class of acts, and of common mental opera tions, is shown very7 convincingly* by the melting"], [445, "MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. 431 of the one set into the other. Thus, for example, the bee and bird will make modifications in the ordinary form of their cells and nests when neces- sity compels them. Thus, the alimentiveness of such animals as the dog, usually definite with regard to quantity and quality, can be pampered or educated up to a kind of epicurism, that is, an indefiniteness of object and action. The same faculty acts limitedly in ourselves at first, dictating the special act of sucking ! afterwards it acquires indefiniteness. Such is the real nature of the distinction between what are called instinct and reason, upon which so many volumes have been written without profit to the world. All faculties are instinctive, that is, dependent on internal and inherent impulses. This term is therefore not specially applicable to either of the recognised modes of the operation of the faculties. We only, in the one case, see the faculty in an immature and slightly developed state ; in the other, in its most advanced condition. In the one case it is defi nite, in the other, indefinite, in its range of action. These terms would perhaps be the most suitable for expressing the distinction. In the humblest forms of being w7e can trace scarcely anything besides a definite action in a"], [446, "432 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. few of the faculties. Generally speaking, as we ascend in the scale, we see more and more of thc faculties in exercise, and these tending more to the indefinite mode of manifestation. And for this there is the obvious reason in providence, that tbe lowest animals have all of them a very limited sphere of existence, born only to perform a few functions, and enjoy a brief term of life, ancl then give way to another generation, so that they do not need much mental power or guidance. At higher points in the scale, the sphere of existence is considerably7 extended, and the mental opera tions are less definite accordingly. The horse, dog, and a few other animals, noticed for their serviceableness to our race, have the indefinite powers in no small endowment. Man, again, shows very little of the definite mode of opera tion, and that little chiefly in childhood, or in barbarism, or idiocy7. Destined for a wide field of action, and to be applicable to infinitely varied contingencies, he has all the faculties developed to a high pitch of indefiniteness, that he may be ready to act well in all imaginable cases. His commission, it may be said, gives large discre tionary powers, while that of the inferior animals is limited to a few precise directions. But when"], [447, "MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. 433 the human brain is congenitally imperfect or dis eased, or when it is in a state of infancy, we see in it an approach towards the character of the brains of some of the inferior animals. Dr. J. G. Davey states that he has frequently witnessed, among his patients at the Hanwell Lunatic Asylum, indications of a particular abnormal cerebration which forcibly reminded him of the specific healthy characteristics of animals lower in the scale of organization ; (10\u00b0) and every one must have observed how often the actions of children, especially in their moments of play, and where their selfish feelings are concerned, bear a resem blance to those of certain familiar animals. Be hold, then, the wonderful unity of the whole sys tem. The grades of mind, like the forms of being, are mere stages of development. In the humbler forms, only a few of the mental faculties are traceable, just as we see in them but a few of the lineaments of universal structure. In man the system has arrived at its highest condition. The few gleams of reason, then, which we see in the lower animals, are precisely analogous to such a development of the fore-arm as we find in the paddle of the whale. Causality, comparison, and other of the nobler faculties, are in them rudimental. u"], [448, "434 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. Bound up as we thus are by an identity in tbe character of our mental organization with the lower animals, we are yet, it will be observed, strikingly distinguished from them by this great. advance in development. We have faculties in full force and activity which the animals either possess not at all, or in so low and obscure a form as to be equivalent to non-existence. Now these parts of mind are those which connect us with the things that are not of this world. We have veneration, prompting us to the worship of the Deity, which the animals lack. We have hope, to carry us on in thought beyond the bounds of time. We have reason, to enable us to inquire into the character of the Great Father, and the relation of us, his humble creatures, to wards him. We have conscientiousness and be nevolence, by which we can in a faint and humble measure imitate, in our conduct, that which he exemplifies in the whole of his wondrous doings. Beyond this, mental science does not carry us in support of religion: the rest depends on evi- dence of a different kind. But it is surely much, that we thus discover in nature a provision for thiDgs so important. The existence of faculties having a regard to such things is a good evidence"], [449, "435 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. that such things exist. The face of God is re flected in the organization of man, as a little pool reflects the glorious sun. The affective or sentimental faculties are all of them liable to operate whenever appropriate ob jects or stimuli are presented, and this they do as irresistibly and unerringly as the tree sucks up moisture which it requires, with only this excep tion, that one faculty often interferes with the action of another, and operates instead, by force of superior inherent strength or temporary acti vity. For example, alimentiveness may be in powerful operation with regard to its appropriate object, producing a keen appetite, and yet it may not act, in consequence of the more powerful operation of cautiousness, warning against evil consequences likely to ensue from the desired indulgence. This liability to flit from under the control of one feeling to the control of anotheT, constitutes what is recognised as free will in man, being nothing more than a vicissitude in the su premacy7 of the faculties over each other. It is a common mistake to suppose that the in dividuals of our own species are all of them formed with similar faculties \u2014 simdar in power and tendency \u2014 and that education and the influ- u 2"], [450, "436 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. ence of circumstances produce all the differences which we observe. There is not, in tbe old sys- tems of mental philosophy, any doctrine more opposite to the truth than this. It is refuted at once by the great differences of intellectual ten- dency and moral disposition to be observed amongst a group of young children who have been all brought up in circumstances perfectly identical \u2014 even in twins, who have never been but in one place, under the charge of one nurse, attended to alike in all respects. The mental characters of individuals are inherently various, as the forms of their persons and the features of their faces are ; and education and circumstances, though their influence is not to be despised, are incapable of entirely altering these characters, where they are strongly developed. That the original characters of mind are dependent on the volume of particular parts of the brain and the general quality of that viscus, is proved by induc tion from an extensive range of observations, the force of which must have been long since univer sally acknowledged, but for the unpreparedness of mankind to admit a functional connexion between mind and body. The different mental characters of individuals may be presumed from analogy to"], [451, "437 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. depend on the same law of development which we have seen determining the forms of being and the mental characters of particular species. This we may conceive as carrying forward the intellec tual powers and moral dispositions of some to a high pitch, repressing those of others at a mode rate amount, and thus producing all the varieties which we see in our fellow-creatures. Thus a Cuvier and a Newton are but expansions of a clown ; and the person emphatically called the wicked man, is one whose highest moral feelings are rudimental. Such differences are not con fined to our species; they are only less strongly marked in many of the inferior animals. There are clever dogs ancl wicked horses, as well as clever men and wicked men ; and education sharpens the talents, and in some degree regu lates the dispositions of animals, as it does our own. There is, nevertheless, a general adaptation of the mental constitution of man to the circum stances in which he lives, as there is between all the parts of nature to each other. The goods of the physical world are only to be realized by in genuity and industrious exertion ; behold, accord ingly, an intellect full of device, and a fabric of"], [452, "438 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. the faculties which would go to pieces or destroy itself if it were not kept in constant occupation. Nature presents to us much that is sublime and beautiful : behold faculties which delight in con templating these properties of hers, and in rising upon them, as upon wings, to the presence of the Eternal. It is also a world of difficulties and perils, and see how a large portion of our species are endowed with vigorous powers, which take a pleasure in meeting and overcoming difficulty* and danger. Even that principle on which our facul ties are constituted \u2014 a wide range of freedom in which to act for all various occasions \u2014 necessi tates a resentful faculty, by which individuals may protect themselves from the undue ancl ca pricious exercise of each other's faculties, and thus preserve their individual rights. So also there is cautiousness, to give us a tendency to provide against the evils by which we may be assailed; and secretiveness, to enable us to con ceal whatever, being divulged, would be offensive to others or injurious to ourselves, \u2014 a function which obviously has a certain legitimate range of action, however liable to be abused. The con stitution of the mind generally points to a state of intimate relation of individuals towards society,"], [453, "MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. 439 towards the external world, and towards things above this world. No individual being is integral or independent ; he is only part of an extensive piece of social mechanism. The inferior mind, full of rude energy7 and unregulated impulse, does not more require a superior nature to act as its master and its mentor, than does the superior nature require to be surrounded by such rough ele ments on which to exercise its high endowments as a ruling and tutelary power. This relation of each to each produces a vast portion ofthe active business of life. It is easy to see that, if we were all alike in om* moral tendencies, and all placed on a medium of perfect moderation in this re sj>ect, the world would be a scene of everlasting dulness and apathy. It requires the variety of individual constitution to give moral life to the scene. The indefiniteness of the potentiality of the human faculties, and the complexity which thus attends their relations, lead unavoidably to occa sional error. If we consider for a moment that there are not less than thirty such faculties, that they are each given in different proportions to different persons, that each is at the same time endowed with a wide discretion as to the force"], [454, "440 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. and frequency of its action, and that our neigh bours, the world, and our connexions with some thing beyond it, are all exercising an ever-vary ing influence over us, we cannot be surprised at the irregularities attending human conduct. It is simply tbe penalty paid for the superior en dowment. It is here that tbe so-called imperfec tion of om* nature resides. Causality and con scientiousness are, it is true, guides over all ; but even these are only faculties of the same indefi nite potentiality as the rest, and partake accord ingly of the same inequality of action. Man is therefore a piece of mechanism, which never can act so as to satisfy his own ideas of what he might be \u2014 for he can imagine a state of moral perfec tion, (as he can imagine a globe formed of dia monds, pearls, and rubies,) though his constitu tion forbids him to realize it. There ever will, in the best disposed and most disciplined minds, be occasional discrepancies between the amount of temptation and the power summoned for regula tion or resistance, or between the stimulus and the mobility of the faculty ; and hence those errors, and shortcomings, and excesses, without end, with which the good are constantly finding cause to charge themselves. There is at the"], [455, "MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. 441 same time even here a possibility of improve ment. In infancy, the impulses are all of them irregular; a child is cruel, cunning, and false, under the slightest temptation, but in time learns to control these inclinations, ancl to be habi tually humane, frank, and truthful. So is human society7, in its earliest stages, sanguinary, aggres sive, and deceitful, but in time, becomes just, faithful, and benevolent. To such improvements there is a natural tendency which will operate in all fair circumstances, though it is not to be ex pected that irregular and undue impulses will ever be altogether banished from the system. It may still be a puzzle to many, how beings should be born into the world whose organization is such that they unavoidably, even in a civilised country, become malefactors. Does God, it may be asked, make criminals ? Does he fashion cer tain beings with a predestination to evil ? He does not do so ; and yet the criminal type of brain, as it is called, comes into existence in ac cordance with laws which the Deity has esta blished. It is not, however, as the result of the first or general intention of those laws, but as an exception from their ordinary and proper action. The production of those evdly disposed beings is u3"], [456, "442 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. in this manner. Tbe moral character of the pro- geny depends in a general way, (as does the physical character also,) upon conditions of the parents, \u2014 both general conditions, and conditions at the particular time of the commencement of the existence of the new being, and likewise ex- ternal conditions affecting the foetus through the mother. Now the amount of these conditions is indefinite. The faculties of the parents, as far as these are concerned, may have oscillated for the time towards the extreme of tensibility in one direction. The influences upon the foetus may have also been of an extreme and unusual kind. Let us suppose that the conditions upon the whole have been favourable for the development, not of the higher, but of the lower sentiments, and of the propensities of the new being, the result will necessarily be a mean type of brain. Here, it will be observed, God no more decreed an im- moral being, than he decreed an immoral pa- roxysm of the sentiments. Our perplexity is in considering the dl-disposed being by himself. He is only a part of a series of phenomena, traceable to a principle, good in the main, but which admits of evil as an exception. We have seen that it is for wise ends that God leaves our moral faculties"], [457, "MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. 443 to an indefinite range of action : the general good results of this arrangement are obvious ; but ex- ceptions of evil are inseparable from such a sys- tem, and this is one of them. To come to par- ticular illustration \u2014 when a people are oppressed, or kept in a state of slavery, they invariably con- tract habits of lying, for the purpose of deceiving and outwitting their superiors, falsehood being a refuge of the weak under difficulties. What is a habit in parents becomes an inherent quality in children. We are not, therefore, to be surprised when a traveller tells us that black children in the West Indies appear to lie by instinct, and never answer a white person truly, even in the simplest matter. Here we have secretiveness roused in a people to a state of constant and ex- alted exercise ; an over tendency of the nervous energy in that direction is the consequence, and a new organic condition is established. This tells upon the progeny, which comes into the world with secretiveness excessive in strength and ac- tivity. All other evil characteristics may be readily conceived as being implanted in a new generation in the same way. And sometimes not one, but several generations, may be concerned in bringing up the result to a pitch which produces"], [458, "444 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. crime. It is, however, to be observed, that tbe general tendency of things is to a limitation, not the extension of such abnormally constituted beings. The criminal brain finds itself in a social scene where all is against it. It may struggle on for a time, but it is sure to be overcome at last by the medium and superior natures. The disposal of such beings will always depend much on the moral state of a community, the degree in which just views prevail with regard to human nature, ancl the feelings which accident may have caused to predominate at a particular time. Where the mass was little enlightened or refined, and terrors for life or property were highly excited, male factors have ever been treated severely. But when order is generally triumphant, and reason allowed sway, men begin to see the true case of criminals \u2014 namely, that while one large section are victims of erroneous social conditions, another are brought to error by* tendencies which they are only unfortunate in having inherited from nature. Criminal jurisprudence then addresses itself less to the direct punishment than to the reformation and care-taking of those liable to its attention. And such a treatment of criminals, it may be fur ther remarked, so that it stop short of affording"], [459, "MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. 445 any encouragement to crime, (a point which ex perience will determine,) is evidently no more than justice, seeing how accidentally all forms of the moral constitution are distributed, and how thoroughly7 mutual obligation shines throughout tbe whole frame of society \u2014 the strong to help the weak, the good to redeem and restrain the bad. The sum of all we have seen of the psychical constitution of man is, that its Almighty Author has destined it, like everything else, to be deve loped from inherent qualities, and to have a mode of action depending solely on its own organiza tion. Thus the whole is complete on one prin ciple. The masses of space are formed by law ; law makes them in due time theatres of existence for plants and animals; sensation, disposition, intellect, are all in like manner developed and sustained in action by law. It is most interesting to observe into how small a field the whole of the mysteries of nature thus ultimately resolve them selves. The inorganic has been thought to have one final comprehensive law, gravitation. The organic, the other great department of mundane things, rests in like manner on one law, and that is \u2014 development. Nor may even these be after"], [460, "446 MENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS. all twain, but only branches of one still more comprehensive law, the expression of a unity, flowing immediately from the One who is First and Last."], [461, "447 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. We have now to inquire how this view of the constitution and origin of nature bears upon the condition of man upon the earth, and his relation to supra-mundane things. That enjoyment is the proper attendant of animal existence is pressed upon us by all that we see and all we experience. Everywhere we perceive in the lower creatures, in their ordinary condition, symptoms of enjoyment. Their whole being is a sy7stem of needs, the supplying of which is gratification, and of faculties, the exercise of which is pleasurable. When we consult our own sensations, we find that, even in a sense of a healthy performance of all the func-"], [462, "448 purpose and general condition tions of the animal economy, God has furnished us with an innocent and very high enjoyment. The mere quiet consciousness of a healthy play of the mental functions \u2014 a mind at ease with itself and all around it \u2014 is in like manner extremely agreeable. This negative class of enjoyments, it may be remarked, is likely7 to be even more ex tensively experienced by the lower animals than by man, at least in the proportion of their abso lute endowments, as their mental and bodily functions are much less liable to derangement than ours. To sind the world constituted on this principle is only7 what in reason we should expect. We cannot conceive that so vast a sys tem could have been created for a contrary7 pur pose. No averagely constituted human being would, in his own limited sphere of action, think of producing a similar system upon an opposite principle. But to form so vast a range of being, and to make being everywhere a source of grati fication, is conformable to our ideas of a Creator, in whom we are constantly discovering traits of a nature, of which our own is a faint and far-cast shadow. It appears at first difficult to reconcile with this idea the many miseries which we see all sentient"], [463, "OF the animated creation. 449 beings, ourselves included, occasionally enduring. How, the sage has asked in every age, should a Being so transcendently7 kind, have allowed of so large an admixture of evil in the condition of his creatures ? Do we not at length sind an answer to a certain extent satisfactory, in the view which has now been given of the constitution of nature ? We there see the Deity operating in the most august of his works by fixed laws, an arrangement which, it is clear, only admits of the main and primary results being good, but disregards excep tions. Now the mechanical laws are so definite in their purposes, that no exceptions ever take place in that department ; if there is a certain quantity of fluid matter to be agglomerated and divided and set in motion as a planetary system, it will be so with hair's -breadth accuracy, and cannot be otherwise. But the laws presiding over meteorology, life, and mind, are necessarily less definite, as they have to produce a great variety of mutually related results. Left to act independently of each other, each according to its separate commission, and each with a wide range of potentiality to be modified by associated conditions, they can only have effects generally beneficial. Often there must be an interference of"], [464, "450 PURPOSE and general condition one law with another ; often a law will chance to operate in excess, or upon a wrong object, and thus evil will be produced. Thus, winds are generally useful in many ways, and the sea is useful as a means of communication between one country and another ; but the natural laws which produce winds are of indefinite range of action, and sometimes are unusually concentrated in space or in time, so as to produce storms and hurricanes, by which much damage is done ; the sea may be by these causes violently agitated, so that many barks and many7 lives perish. Here, it is evident, the evil is only exceptive. Suppose, again, that a boy, in the course of the lively sports proper to his age, suffers a fall which injures his spine, and renders him a cripple for life. Two things have been concerned in the case : first, the love of violent exercise, and second, the law of gravitation. Both of these things are good in the main. Boys, in the rash enterprises and rough sports in which they engage, are only making the first delightful trials of a boddy and mental energy which has been bestowed upon them as necessary for their figuring properly in a scene where many energies are called for, and where the exertion of these powers is ever a source of"], [465, "451 of the animated creation. happiness. By gravitation, all moveable things, our own bodies included, are kept stable on the surface of the earth. But when it chances that the playful boy loses his hold (we shall say) of the branch of a tree, and has no solid support immediately below, the law of gravitation unre lentingly pulls him to the ground, and thus he is hurt. Now it was not a primary* object of gravi tation to injure boys ; but gravitation could not but operate in the circumstances, its nature being to be universal and invariable. The evd is, there fore, only a casual exception from something in the main good. The same explanation applies to even the most conspicuous of the evils which afflict society. War, it may be said, and said truly, is a tre mendous example of evil, in the misery, hard ship, waste of human life, and mis-spending of human energies, which it occasions. But what is it that produces war ? Certain tendencies of human nature ; as keen assertion of a supposed right, resentment of supposed injury7, acquisitive ness, desire of admiration, combativeness, or mere love of excitement. All of these are tendencies which every day, in a legitimate extent of action, produce great and indispensable benefits to us."], [466, "452 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION Man would be a tame, indolent, unserviceable being without them, and his fate would be starva tion. War, then, huge evil though it be, is, after all, but the exceptive case, a casual misdirection of properties ancl powers essentially good. God has given us the tendencies for a benevolent pur pose. He has only not laid down any absolute obstruction to our misuse of them. That w*ere an arrangement of a kind which he has nowhere made. But he has established many laws in our nature which tend to lessen the frequency and destructiveness of these abuses. Our reason comes to see that war is purely an evd, even to the conqueror. Benevolence interposes to make its ravages less mischievous to human com fort, and less destructive to human life. Men begin to find that their more active powers can be exercised with equal gratification on legitimate objects ; for example, in overcoming the natural difficulties of their path through life, or in a gene rous spirit of emulation in a line of duty bene ficial to themselves and their fellow-creatures. Thus, war at length shrinks into a comparatively narrow compass, though there certainly is no reason to suppose that it will be at any early period, if ever, altogether dispensed with, while"], [467, "OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. 453 man's constitution remains as it is. In con sidering an evil of this kind, we must not limit om* view to our own or any past time. Placed upon the earth with faculties prepared to act, but inexperienced, and with the more active propen sities necessarily in great force to suit the condi tion of the globe, man was apt to misuse his powers much in this way at first, compared with what he is likely to do when he advances into a condition of civilization. In the scheme of Pro vidence, thousands of years of frequent warfare, all the so-called glories which fill history, may be but a subordinate consideration. The chronology of God is not as our chronology. See the patience of waiting evinced in the slow development of the animated kingdoms, throughout the long series of geological ages. Nothing is it to him that an entire goodly planet should, for an inconceivable period, have no inhabiting organisms superior to reptiles. Progressive, not instant effect, is his sublime rule. What, then, can it be to him that the human race goes through a career of impul sive acting for a few thousand years ? The cruelties of ungoverned anger, the tyrannies of the rude and proud over the humble and good, the martyr's pains, and the patriot's despair, what"], [468, "454 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION are all these but incidents of an evolution of superior being which has been pre-arranged and set forward in independent action, free within a certain limit, but in tbe main constrained, through primordial law, to go on ever brightening ancl perfecting, yet never, while the present dispensa tion of nature shall last, to be quite perfect ! The sex passion in like manner leads to great evils. Providence has seen it necessary to make very ample provision for the preservation and utmost possible extension of all species. The aim seems to be to diffuse existence as widely as pos sible, to fill up every vacant piece of space with some sentient being to be a vehicle of enjoyment. Hence this passion is conferred in great force. But the relation between the number of beings, and tbe means of supporting them, is only on the footing of general law. There may be occasional discrepancies between the laws operating for the multiplication of individuals, and the laws operat ing to supply them with the means of subsist ence, and evils will be endured in consequence, even in our own highly favoured species. But against all these evils, and against those num berless vexations which have arisen in all ages from the attachment of the sexes, place the vast"], [469, "OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. 455 amount of happiness which is derived from this source \u2014 the basis of the whole circle of the domestic affections, the sweetening principle of life, the prompter of all our most generous feel ings, and even of our most virtuous resolves and exertions \u2014 and every ill that can be traced to it is but as dust in the balance. And here, also, we must be on our guard against judging from what we see in the world at a particular era. As reason and the higher sentiments of man's nature increase in force, this passion is put under better regula tion, so as to lessen many of the evils connected with it. The civilized man is more able to give it due control; his attachments are less the result of impulse : he studies more the weal of his partner and offspring. There are even some of the resentful feelings connected in early society with love, such as hatred of successful rivalry, and jealousy7, which almost disappear in an advanced state of civilization. The evil springing, in our own species at least, from this passion, may there fore be an exception mainly peculiar to a parti cular term of the world's progress, and which may be expected to decrease greatly in amount. With respect, again, to disease, so prolific a cause of suffering to man, the human constitution"], [470, "456 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION is merely a complicated but regular process in electro-chemistry, which goes on well, and is a source of continual gratification, so long as no thing occurs to interfere with it injuriously, but which is liable every moment to be deranged by various external agencies, when it becomes a source of pain, and, if the injury be severe, ceases to be capable of retaining life. It may be readily admitted that the evils experienced in this way are very great; but, after all, such experiences are no more than occasional, and not necessarily frequent \u2014 exceptions from a general rule of which the direct action is to confer happiness. The human constitution might have been made of a more hardy character ; but we always see hardi ness and insensibility go together, and it may be of course presumed that we only could have pur chased this immunity from suffering at the ex pense of a large portion of that delicacy in which lie some of our most agreeable sensations. Or man's faculties might have been restricted to de finitiveness of action, as is greatly the case with those of the lower animals, and thus we should have been equally safe from the aberrations which lead to disease ; but in that event we should have been incapable of acting to so many different"], [471, "OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. 457 purposes as we are, and of the many high enjoy ments which the varied action of our faculties places in our power; we should not, in short, have been human beings, but merely on a level with the inferior animals. Thus, it appears, that the very fineness of man's constitution, that which places him in such a high relation to the mundane economy, and makes him the vehicle of so many exquisitely delightful sensations \u2014 it is this which makes him liable to the sufferings of disease. It might be said, on the other hand, that the noxiousness of the agencies producing disease might have been diminished or extinguished ; but the probability is, that this could not have been done without such a derangement of the whole economy of nature as would have been attended with more serious evds. For example \u2014 a large class of diseases are the result of effluvia from decaying organic matter. This kind of matter is known to be extremely useful when mixed'with earth, in favouring the process of vegetation. Supposing the noxiousness to the human consti tution done away with, might we not also lose that important quality which tends so largely to in crease the food raised from the ground? Perhaps (as has been somewhere suggested) the noxious- x"], [472, "458 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION ness is even a matter of special design, to induce us to put away decaying organic substances into the earth, where they are calculated to be so use ful. Now man has reason to enable him to see that such substances are beneficial under one arrange ment, and noxious in the other. He is, as it were, commanded to take the right method in dealing with them. In point of fact, men do not always take this method, but allow accumulations of noxious matter to gather close about their dwell ings, where they generate fevers and agues. But their doing so may7 be regarded as only a tempo rary exception from the operation of mental laws, the general tendency of which is to make men adopt the proper measures. Ancl these measures will probably be in time universally adopted, so that one extensive class of diseases will be alto gether or nearly abolished. Another large class of diseases spring from mismanagement of our personal economy. Eat ing to excess, eating and drinking what is noxious, disregard to that cleanliness which is necessary for the right action of the functions of the skin, want of fresh air for the supply of the lungs, undue, excessive, and irregular indulgence of the mental affections, are all of them recognised"], [473, "OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. 459 modes of creating that derangement of the system in which disease consists. Here also it may be said that a limitation of the mental faculties to definite manifestations (vulgo, instincts) might have enabled us to avoid many of these errors ; but here again we are met by the consideration that, if we had been so endowed, we should have been only as the lower animals are, \u2014 wanting that transcendenfly7 higher character of sensation and power, by which our enjoyments are made so much greater. In making the desire of food, for example, with us an indefinite mental manifesta tion, instead of the definite one, which it mainly is amongst the lower animals, the Creator has given us a means of deriving far greater gratifica tions from food (consistently with health) than the lower animals generally appear to be capable of. He has also given us reason to act as a guid- ing and controlling power over this and other propensities, so that they may be prevented from becoming causes of malady. We can see that excess is injurious, and are thus prompted to moderation. We can see that all the things which we feel inclined to take are not health ful, and are thus exhorted to avoid what are pernicious. We can also see that a cleanly skin x 2"], [474, "460 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION and a constant supply of pure air are necessary to the proper performance of some of the most important of the organic functions, and thus are stimulated to frequent ablution, and to a right ventilation of our parlours and sleeping apart ments. And so on with the other causes of dis ease. Reason may not operate very powerfully to these purposes in an early state of society, and prodigious evils may therefore have been endured from diseases in past ages ; but these are not necessarily to be endured always. As civilization advances, reason acquires a greater ascendancy ; the causes of the evils are seen and avoided ; and disease shrinks into a comparatively narrow com pass. The experience of our own country places this in a striking light. In the middle ages, when large towns had no police regulations, society was at frequent intervals scourged by pestilence. The third part of the people of Europe are said to have been carried off by one epidemic. Even in London the annual mortality has greatly sunk within a century. The improvement in human life, which has taken place since the construction of the Northampton tables by Dr. Price, is equally remarkable. Modem tables still show a prodi gious mortality among the young in all civilized countries^evidently a result of some prevalent"], [475, "OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. 461 error in the usual modes of rearing them. But to remedy this evil there is the sagacity of the human mind, and the desire to adopt any re formed plans which may be shown to be neces sary. By a change in the management of an orphan institution in London, during the last fifty years, an immense reduction in the mortality took place. We may of course hope to see measures devised and adopted for producing a similar im provement of infant life throughout the world at large. In this part of our subject, the most difficult point certainly lies in those occurrences of disease where the afflicted individual has been in no degree concerned in bringing the visitation upon himself. Daily experience shows us infectious disease arising in a place where the natural laws in respect of cleanliness are neglected, and then spreading into regions where there is no blame of this kind. We then see the innocent suffering equally with those who may be called the guilty. Nay, the benevolent physician who comes to suc cour the miserable beings whose error may have caused the mischief, is sometimes seen to fall a victim to it, while many of his patients recover. We are also only too familiar with the transmis sion of diseases from erring parents to innocent"], [476, "462 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION children, who accordingly suffer, and perhaps die prematurely, as it were for the sins of others. After all, however painful such cases may be in contemplation, they cannot be regarded in any other light than as exceptions from arrangements, the general working of which is beneficial. With regard to the innocence of the suffering parties, there is one important consideration which is pressed upon us from many quarters \u2014 namely, that moral conditions have not the least concern in the working of the physical laws. These arrangements proceed with an entire in dependence of all such conditions, and desirably so, for otherwise there could be no certain depen dence placed upon them. Thus it may happen that two persons ascending a piece of scaffolding, the one a virtuous, the other a vicious man, the former, being the less cautious of the two, ven tures upon an insecure place, falls, and is killed, while the other, choosing a better footing, remains uninjured. It is not in what we can con ceive of the nature of things, that there should be a special exemption from the ordinary laws of matter, to save this virtuous man. So it might be that, of two physicians, attending fever cases in a mean part of a large city, the one, an excellent"], [477, "463 OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. citizen, may stand in such a position with respect to the beds of the patients as to catch the infec- tion, of which he dies in a few days, while the other, a bad husband and father, and who, unlike the other, only attends such cases with selfish ends, takes care to be as much as possible out of the stream of infection, and accordingly escapes. In both of these cases man's sense of good and evd \u2014 his faculty of conscientiousness \u2014 would in- cline him to destine the vicious man to destruc- tion and save the virtuous. But the Great Ruler of Nature does not act on such principles. He has established laws for the operation of inanimate matter, which are quite unswerving, so that, when we know them, we have only to act in a certain way with respect to them, in order to obtain all the benefits and avoid all the evils connected with them. He has likewise established moral laws in our nature, which are equally unswerving, (allowing for their wider range of action,) and from obedience to which unfailing good is to be derived. But the two sets of laws are indepen- dent of each other. Obedience to each gives only its own proper advantage, not the advantage proper to the other. Hence it is that virtue forms no protection against the evils connected with the"], [478, "464 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION physical laws, while, on the other hand, a man skilled in, and attentive to these, but unrighteous, and disregardful of his neighbour, is in like manner not protected by his attention to physical circumstances from the proper consequences of neglect or breach of the moral laws. Thus it is that the innocence of the party suffering for the faults of a parent, or of any other person or set of persons, is evidently a considera tion quite apart from that suffering. In short, the whole question of evil, a puzzle throughout all ages, only becomes explicable when we receive and study the system of a mun dane government in the manner of law. There is no need for considering it as a detraction from either the power or the goodness of God. The dispensation under which we live has been con stituted by him on the principle of law ; but this is not necessarily to imply that either his good ness or his power is to stop at this point. That such, however, is the character of the pageantry of worldly events now passing, is the only idea we can arrive at when we approach the question without prejudice. How else should it be that in any case the guilty flourish and the innocent suffer ? How else should it be that men often"], [479, "OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. 465 endure bitter woe and pain while prosecuting the noblest objects ? How else should we ever see so simple an event as the following, which meets my ey7es in the journals, while these sheets pass through the press : \u2014 A multitude of poor Irish emigrants are embarked in a canal boat, about to leave their native district for a port whence they are to sail for America. At the moment of parting, they crowd to one side, to shake hands for the last time with their friends. The vessel is over balanced and turned upon its side. Of the multi tude thrown into the water, seven are taken up dead. Here an action rather amiable and laudable than otherwise, leads to the loss of life, \u2014 a pure evil, unmixed with good. It is impossible to imagine such a transaction occurring under the immediate direction of the Deity ; it would be profaning human nature to attribute any such act to the immediate command or interference of a man. But there is no difficulty in understanding how such occasional evils should take place in the course of a chain of causes which only pro ceed in consequence of a general impulse de signed in the main for good. Evil, indeed, is one of the strongest proofs that could be desired for the reality of this system. x 3"], [480, "466 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION We see it in one of its most famdiar forms in the destructive animals. An innocent little bird in the claws of the cruel hawk \u2014 a poor stag grasped by the ruthless boa \u2014 a lamb in the fangs of the wolf \u2014 can we imagine a form of misery greater than is exhibited in these animals ? Yet mdlions of such creatures perish in this manner annually, and have so done since long before there existed a human heart to pine or break with its more sentimental, but not less real wretchedness. Upon no theory can this be understood except upon that of an economy governed by general laws. The carni vorous animals are simply the police and under takers of the inferior creation, preventing their too great increase, and clearing off all such as grow weakly and die, ere they can become in any degree a burden to themselves or a nuisance to other creatures. For these functions the destruc tive tribes have been expressly organized, and their organization of course is of divine appoint ment. Constituted as we are, we cannot suppose a plan involving so much suffering to have been adopted except with a view to that independency, or completeness within itself, which is here argued for as the manner in which the Deity's operations on earth are revealed to us. He has"], [481, "OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. 467 endowed the families which enjoy his bounties with an almost indefinite fecundity, that enjoy ment may be as widely diffused as possible ; but the limitation of the results of this fecundity within the line necessary according to circum stances, were no right immediate employment for himself. The object is accomplished, in a befit ting manner, by his ordaining that certain other animals shall have endowments sure so to act as to bring the rest of animated beings to a proper balance. And the object is accomplished well; insomuch that we never hear of any but the most partial and transient discrepancy between the volume of inferior animal life and the power ap pointed for its regulation. Even in this sad chapter of nature, we are forced to acknowledge that, upon the theory of law, everything is very good. Another proof, or rather another branch of the same proof, lies in the relation of the individual to the mass, as far as endowment and destiny are concerned. We see, for example, powerful im pulses in human nature, which often occasion great inconveniences both to those yielding to them and to others. But such impulses are in the main necessary. Destructive, in many cases,"], [482, "468 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION to the individual, they are conservative with re spect to the totality. What is this but an appoint ment to render the machine in that respect (so to speak) a self-acting one ? Many of the confusions of the moral scene might be thus explained ; but it is also to be observed that such impulses are not sent alone \u2014 they come in company with in telligence and moral emotion, powers continually tending more and more to soften and regulate their actions. Nor are any of the ordinary evils of our world altogether unmixed. God, contemplating appa rently the unbending action of his great laws, has established others which appear to be designed to have a compensating, a repairing, and a consoling effect. Suppose, for instance, that, from a defect in the power of development in a mother, her off spring is ushered into the world destitute of some of the most useful members, or blind, or deaf, or of imperfect intellect, there is ever to be found in the parents and other relatives, and in the sur rounding public, a sympathy with the sufferer, which tends to make up the deficiency, so that he usually is in the long run not much a loser. In deed, the benevolence implanted in our nature seems to be an arrangement having for one of its"], [483, "469 OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. principal objects to cause us, by sympathy and active aid, to remedy the evils unavoidably suf fered by our fellow-creatures in the course of the operation of the other natural laws. And even in the sufferer himself, it is often found that a defect in one point is made up for by an extra power in another. The blind come to have a sense of touch much more acute than those who see. Persons born without hands have been known to acquire a power of using tbeir feet for a number of the principal offices usually served by that member. I need hardly say how remarkably fatuity is compensated by the more than usual regard paid to the children bom with it by their parents, and the zeal which others usually feel to protect and succour such persons. In short, we never see evd of any kind take place where there is not some remedy or compensating principle ready to interfere for its alleviation. And there can be no doubt that in this manner suffering of all kinds is very much relieved. We may, then, regard the globes of space as theatres designed for the residence of animated sentient beings, placed there with this as their first and most obvious purpose \u2014 to be sensible of enjoyments from the exercise of their faculties in"], [484, "470 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION relation to external things. The faculties of the various species are very different, but the happi ness of each depends on the harmony there may be between its particular faculties and its par ticular circumstances. For instance, place the small-brained sheep or ox in a good pasture, and it fully enjoys this harmony of relation ; but man, having many more faculties, cannot be thus con tented. Besides having a sufficiency of food and bodily* comfort, he must have entertainment for his intellect, whatever be its grade, objects for the domestic and social affections, objects for the sentiments. He is also a progressive being, and what pleases him to-day may not please him to morrow; but in each case he demands a sphere of appropriate conditions in order to be happy. By virtue of his superior organization, his enjoy ments are much higher and more varied than those of any of the lower animals; but tbe very complexity of circumstances affecting him renders it at the same time unavoidable, that his nature should be often inharmoniously placed and dis agreeably affected, and that he should therefore be unhappy. Still, unhappiness amongst man kind is the exception from the rule of their con dition, and an exception which is capable of"], [485, "OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. 471 almost infinite diminution, by virtue of the im proving reason of man, and the experience which he acquires in working out the problems of so ciety. To secure the immediate means of happiness, it would seem to be necessary for men first to study with all care the constitution of nature; and, secondly, to accommodate themselves to that constitution, so as to obtain all the realizable ad vantages from acting conformably to it, and to avoid all likely evils from disregarding it. It will be of no use to sit down and expect that things are to operate of their own accord, or through the direction of a partial deity, for our benefit; equally so were it to expose ourselves to palpable dangers, under the notion that we shall, for some reason, have a dispensation or exemp tion from them : we must endeavour so to place ourselves, and so to act, that the arrangements which Providence has made impartially for all may7 be in our favour, and not against us ; such are the only means by which we can obtain good and avoid evil here below. (101) And, in doing this, it is especially necessary that care be taken to avoid interfering with the like efforts of other men, beyond what may have been agreed upon"], [486, "472 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION by* the mass as necessary for the general good. Such interferences, tending in any way to injure the body, property, or peace of a neighbour, or to the injury of society in general, tend to reflect evil upon ourselves through the re-action which they produce in the feelings of our neighbour and of society, and also the offence which they give to our own conscientiousness and benevolence. On the other hand, when we endeavour to promote the efforts of our fellow-creatures to attain happi ness, we produce a re-action of the contrary kind, the tendency of which is towards our own benefit. The one course of action tends to the injury, the other to the benefit of ourselves and others. By the one course, the general design of the Creator towards his creatures is thwarted; by the other, it is favoured. And thus we can readily see the most substantial grounds for regarding all moral emotions and doings as divine in their nature, and as a means of rising to and communing with God. Obedience is not selfishness, which it would otherwise be \u2014 it is worship. The merest barbarians have a glimmering sense of this philo sophy, and it continually shines out more and more clearly as men advance in intelligence. Nor are individuals alone concerned here. The same"], [487, "473 OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. rule applies as between one great body or class of men and another, and also between nations. Thus, if one set of men keep others in the condi tion of slaves \u2014 this being a gross injustice to the subjected party, the mental manifestations of that party7 to the masters will be such as to mar the comfort of their lives; the minds of the masters themselves will be degraded by the association with beings so degraded; and thus, with some immediate or apparent benefit from keeping slaves, there will be, in a far greater degree, an experience of evd. So also, if one portion of a nation, engaged in a particular department of in dustry7, grasp at some advantages injurious to the other sections ofthe people, the first effect will be an injury to those other portions ofthe nation, and the second a re-active injury to the injurers, making their guilt their punishment. And so when one nation commits an aggression upon the property or rights of another, or even pursues towards it a sordid or ungracious policy, the effects are sure to be redoubled evil from the offended party. All of these things are under laws which make the effects, on a large range, absolutely certain; and an individual, a party, a people, can no more act unjustly with safety, than"], [488, "474 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION I could with safety place my leg in the track of a coming wain, or attempt to fast thirty days. We have been constituted on the principle of only being able to realize happiness for ourselves when our fellow-creatures are also happy; it is therefore necessary that we both do to others only as we would have others to do to us, and endeavour to promote their happiness as well as om* own. There is even a higher law, which has long been announced, but never acted on to any considerable extent, that our greatest happiness is not to be realized by each having a regard for himself, but by each seeking primarily7 to benefit his fellow-creatures. When man comes to have confidence in his own nature, he will begin to act on this principle, and the result will be a degree of happiness such as we only see at present faintly shadowed forth in the purest and sweetest charities of family life \u2014 a happiness from which there will be no class exceptions. The question whether the human race will ever advance far beyond its present position in intel lect and morals, is one which has engaged much attention. Judging from the past, we cannot reasonably doubt that great advances are yet to be made ; but if the principle of development be"], [489, "OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. 475 admitted, these are certain, whatever may be the space of time required for their realization. A progression resembling development may be traced in human nature, both in the individual and in large groups of men. The individual is in childhood under the influence of the propensi ties and instinctive aptitudes; in youth, he is swayed by marvellousness, the love of the beau tiful, the imaginative : in full maturity, he passes under (comparatively) the domination of reason. In perfect analogy, a nation is at first impulsive and unreasoning; afterwards it is conducted by the second class of sentiments, (the age of my thologies, hierocracies, man and idea worships;) finally, its institutions approximate to an accu rate regard for what is convenient and profitable, under the control of justice and humanity. The advance of knowledge favours the progress of the moral conditions, and in improved moral condi tions knowledge becomes more sound. In tolerably favourable circumstances, this tendency7 onward never fails to make itself visible ; and it is evi dent that, though many nations seem nearly sta tionary and others appear to retrograde, there is always a progress in some place, so that no long space of time ever elapses without showing, upon"], [490, "476 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION the whole, a certain advance. By the work of our thoughtful brains and busy hands, we modify external nature in a way never known before. Under the operations of tillage, of mechanism, of building, making, and inventing; of those appli cations of natural powers and forces which human wit turns to account in so many ways ; of all the results of social experience, of knowledge, and of arrangement; the earth tends to become a much serener field of existence than it was in the earlier ages of man's history. Its progress in this respect may not be clearly seen at a parti cular time, through the obscuring effect of tempo rary and accidental causes; but that the tendency of the physical improvements wrought by7 man upon the surface, and of the mechanic movements which he invents for the saving of his own labour, is to improve the daily comforts, and allow room for the intellectual and moral advancement of earth's children, cannot be denied without some thing like flying in the face of Providence itself. These improvements, then, thus partly wrought out by the exertions of the present race, I con ceive as at once preparations for, and causes of, the possible development of higher types of humanity, \u2014 beings less strong in the impulsive"], [491, "OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. 477 parts of our nature, physical nature giving less matter for that nature to contend with and sub due to its needs, \u2014 more strong in the reason ing and the moral, because there will be less of the opposite to give these marring or check, \u2014 more fitted for the delights of social life, because society will then present less to dread and more to love. The history and constitution of the world have now been explained according to the best lights which a humble individual has found within the reach of his perceptive and reasoning faculties. We have seen a system in which all is regularity and order, ancl all flows from and is obedient to a divine code of laws of unbending operation. We are to understand from what has been laid before us, that man, with his varied mental powers and impulses, is a natural problem, of which the ele ments can be taken cognizance of by science, and that all the secular destinies of our race, from generation to generation, are but evolutions from a primal arrangement in the counsels of Deity. To many, at first sight, it is apt to appear as a dreary view of the divine economy of our world, as if it placed God at an immeasur able distance from his creatures, and left them"], [492, "478 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION without refuge or remedy from the numberless ills that \" flesh is heir to,\" and which no one can hope altogether to escape. But in reality, God may be presumed to be revealed to us in every one of the phenomena of the system, in the sus pension of globes in space, in the degradation of rocks and the upthrowing of mountains, in the development of plants and animals, in each move ment of our minds, and in all that we enjoy and suffer, seeing that, the system requiring a sus tainer as well as an originator, he must be con tinually present in every part of it, albeit he does not permit a single law to swerve in any case from its appointed course of operation. Thus, we may still feel that He is the immediate breather of our life and ruler of our spirits, that we may, by rightly directed thought, come into communion with him, and feel that, even when his penal ordinances are enforced upon us, his hand and arm are closely about us. Nor is this all. It may be that, while we are committed to take our chance in a natural system of undeviat ing operation, and are left, with apparent ruth lessness, to endure the consequences of every collision into which we knowingly or unknow ingly come with each of its regulations, there is a system of Mercy and Grace behind the screen of"], [493, "OF THE ANIMATED CREATION. 479 nature, towards which we stand in a peculiar class of relations, winch is capable of compen sating for all casualties endured here, and whose very largeness is what makes these casualties a matter of indifference to God. For the existence of such a system, the actual constitution of na ture is indeed a powerful argument. The rea soning may proceed thus : \u2014 the system of nature assures us that benevolence is a leading principle in the Divine Mind. But that system is at the same time deficient in a means of making this benevolence of invariable operation. To recon cile this to the character of the Deity, it is neces sary to suppose that the present system is but a part of a whole, a stage in a Great Progress, and that the Redress is in reserve. Another argu ment here occurs \u2014 the economy of nature, beau tifully arranged and vast in its extent as it is, does not satisfy even man's idea of what might be ; he feels that, if this multiplicity of theatres for the exemplification of such phenomena as we see on earth were to go on for ever un changed, it would not be worthy of the Being capable of creating it. An endless monotony of human generations, with their humble thinkings and doings, even though liable to a certain im provement, seems an object beneath that august"], [494, "480 PURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION, ETC. Being. But the mundane economy might be very well as a portion of some greater pheno menon, the rest of which was yet to be evolved. Our system, therefore, though it may at first appear at issue with other doctrines in esteem amongst mankind, tends to come into harmony with them, and even to give them support. I would say, in conclusion, that, even where the two above arguments may fail of effect, there may yet be a faith derived from this view of nature suffi cient to sustain us under all sense of the imper fect happiness, the calamities, the woes, and pains of this sphere of being. For let us but fully and truly7 consider what a system is here laid open to view, ancl we cannot well doubt that we are in the hands of One who is both able and willing to do us the most entire justice. Surely in such a faith we may well rest at ease, even though life shoidd have been to us but a protracted malady, or though every hope we had built on the secu lar materials within our reach were felt to be melting from our grasp.

But to whatever cause attributable \u2014 and it is easy to attribute a derogatory one \u2014 so it is, that I have never for a moment seen reason to doubt that the view of nature presented in this volume is in the main right.

Without the least regard to the strength of the general argument, or the force of other illustrations, an exception was taken, on the strength of these, to the whole work. What was to be expected from me in this case ? Surely not to abandon the general argument, which re mained untouched. It seemed enough to dismiss or rectify the challenged facts, and leave the book otherwise as it was. This I have done. Another set of objections was of a more positive nature. It was said that the highest invertebrates came at the beginning. Of the fishes the highest were first. The earliest reptiles had the highest kind of teeth. There was no imperfection, no appearance of a rude first effort of nature, in the earliest animals. The progress, too, was not uniformly shaded, but contained great breaks and blanks which no theory of development could account for. Was I to give way to these objec tions, presented by persons who, in their eager ness to magnify them, almost sank out of sight y2"], [498, "484 NOTE CONCLUSORY. the great facts that invertebrates preceded verte brates, and that the latter, as far as classes, at least, were concerned, came in the succession of an improved organization ? Holding rather to the great and indubitable facts, I thought it well to examine carefully* the strength of those smaller ones which were thought adverse. The conse quence was the discovery that some of the objec tions rested on false or partial views of science (see Note 55), and that others were grounded on false assumptions regarding the theory itself. For instance, there is nothing in it to imply that the early animals were imperfect or of rude form ; they only are low in the scale. Neither does the development theory forbid that the early lacertine sauria should have had better teeth than the same family in our own time ; the explanation is, that the transitions from class to class were, in general, comparatively great advances in development, and comparatively independent of physical conditions, while some of the inferior mutations were, partly through the agency of physical conditions, towards a reduction in some of the external features of organization, particularly in the teeth and the character of the locomotive system ; nature being, as was said from the first in this work, alike"], [499, "NOTE CONCLUSORY. 485 willing to go forward and to go back, at least within a certain range. Partly by this general width of class transitions, were the so-called breaks to be accounted for \u2014 for example, that which seems to isolate the birds. Partly, these breaks were owing to blanks in the series of de posits, as suggested by some of the geologists themselves. It therefore seemed sufficient, with regard to this class of objections, to present the statements to wilich they refer in such a manner and with such explanations as might quietly set them aside. This I have likewise done. The rest of the opposition was solely based in preconceptions of a different nature with regard to the history of the world. Here the only ques tion, of course, was as to the comparative strength of the grounds for these preconceptions. Did they rest on positive natural evidence ? were they more in harmony with what is ascertained in science than my views ? It was always assumed that these preconceptions were of good founda tion of one kind or another; but the assumption could bear no examination.

As to the geologist's notion of successive creations by special fiat, it is but a notion in itself, and one not over consistent with facts (see pp. 51, 52), not to speak of its glar ing inconsistency as an event with the origin of the physical arrangements of the universe. It was said \u2014 \"We must reason from what we know to what we do not know. We see no species ori ginate or change in our time, nor in some species has there been any change during two or three thousand years.\" But, what if the transactions contemplated were of such a nature that we could expect no immediate trace of them in our time, or that a thousand times three thousand years were insufficient to realise them before our eyes ? Very right to reason from what we know to what we do not know; but in this case let it be from the material to the organic arrangements, from the embryotic progress of a single being to that of the animal kingdom. Let us take the facts we have, and not clamour vainly for others which are unat tainable.

This I have all along done, and I have done nothing more. Thus it is that the work maintains its original ground, without one material alteration, although with many minor modifications designed to render it more convincing and less assailable. Far, far it must still be from that completeness and accu racy which a more experienced student of science could give it ; still farther is it from what such a work might be in the next age. Yet, such as it is, I once more present it with unabated confidence in its general truth as a theory, and in its power of beneficially affecting the opinions of my fellow creatures. As yet, opposition has only tended to results which have fortified the argument. Let it continue, and all of it that is just will produce no effect but that of clearing away more and more of the mists which prevent scientific men from seeing the true lineaments of nature. For my own part, I can only congratulate myself on the difficulties which have been conjured by truth and by pre judice into my path, since all of them have been found superable.

Among the most extraordinary phenomena of natural science must be placed those relating to the fall of meteoric stones. The fact itself, so long doubted, has now been esta- blished by an accumulation of the most positive and unex- ceptionable evidence. The stones have been seen to fall, and taken up in a still heated state ; \u2014 there can be no manner of doubt about the fact, although the explanation is extremely difficult. All these stones are found on examination to re- semble each other in their general characters ; they usually consist of an earthy material, having disseminated through its substance globules and small masses of metallic iron con- taining nickel in the state of alloy. The stones are often covered by a thin vitreous crust, as if partial fusion had com- menced. It is well known, also, that large masses of soft, malleable iron, also containing nickel, are found in several places far removed from each other, lying loose upon the earth, as in South America and in Siberia, and no doubt can exist of the meteoric origin of these masses. It has been conjectured that these meteoric stones proceed from the moon, having been shot out from volcanoes with such violence as to be brought within the reach of the earth's attraction.

But what is exceedingly remarkable, and particularly worthy of notice as strengthening the argument that all the members of the solar system, and perhaps of other systems, have a similar constitution, no new elements are found in these bodies ; they contain the ordinary materials of the earth, but associated in a manner altogether new, and unlike anything known in terrestrial mineralogy. \u2014 Note by a Correspondent.

From the experiment of Professor Lindley, which seemed to prove that dicotyledonous trees perish in water sooner than the monocotyledons, it has been said that, pro bably, we only find the carbonigenous vegetation to be lowly because the higher trees were incapable of being preserved. It is, however, remarkable, that the dicotyledons abound in the tertiary strata, which could hardly have been the case if they were incapable of resisting the effects of water. The objectors would need, at least, to account for these trees withstanding dissolution in that age, if they are to be sup posed to have perished so readily in the earlier epoch. It is also to be remarked, that the dicotyledons do exist in the carbonigenous era ; only they are extremely few. Finding simple sea-plants in the earlier fossiliferous strata and dico tyledons abundant in the last, while the intermediate carbonic period presents the intermediate kinds of plants in abundance, and only a scantling of any higher forms, it appears the most legitimate inference in the case, that the earth has witnessed a botanical progress connected with time, and only reached"], [508, "494 NOTES, the highest vegetable forms at acomparatively recent period ; thus presenting a history entirely analogous to what geology shows us of the animal kingdom.

The absence of philosophic discrimination from the present work has been illustrated by many critical references to this passage. The simple fact is, that the reviewers have themselves failed in discrimination ; not observing that it is the forms merely, not the internal constitution, of living bodies, which I have suggested to be a result of similar forces to those productive of the forms of crystals. The idea, after all, did not originate here, but was adopted partly from the following passage in Mr. Leithead's work on Electricity, (1837) :\u2014 \" the form of the route of free electricity is modi- fied by the medium through which it passes, and also by the electrical state of such medium, or of that ofthe relative elec- trical conditions of two bodies between which it is transmit- ted. If the medium through which it passes possesses a very inferior conducting power, it is obvious that a certain mo- mentum must be requisite to enable the fluid to force its passage to a given distance, and there will be a point at which the momentum of the fluid and the resistance of the body will exactly counterbalance each other ; but so soon as the electricity has again accumulated to a sufficient degree to overcome the resistance, it will again force its way in another direction, until it arrives at another point of equilibrium. In this way we may readily see the modus operandi of the electric fluid in imparting regular forms to bodies ; and it is highly probable that its action in this respect extends to the vegetable kingdom, and perhaps operates even on animals, from the time in which they exist in the embryo state Another fact, in support of the opinion that the distinctive forms of bodies are produced by electrical action, is, that crystals, and the twigs and leaves of vegetables, all terminate in points or sharp edges, so that the electrical action can proceed no further in"], [512, "498 NOTES increasing the growth, or, in other words, in propelling fresh portions of matter for the extension of the plant, or the crystal, beyond the pointed or edged termination.\" (48.)

I am bound to admit, in the meantime, that the identity of the globules produced in albumen by electricity with living cells, and the fact of the reproduction of living globules, are both doubted by physiologists of high character. In this, as in other instances, particular illustrations may be held in doubt, or may altogether fail, without necessary injury to other arguments. (51.)

A more general, but more interesting argument in favour of primitive production, though not conclusively so, has been presented in the following terms : \u2014 \" We see a simple germ \u2014 the nucleus of a cell \u2014 develop itself into a feeling, moving, thinking man, by drawing into itself, and combining into new forms, the particles of what we are accustomed to call inorganic matter.

Hence we must attribute to all those substances, which are thus drawn from the inorganic into the organic mode of existence, a latent capacity for the latter; \u2014 just as we say that the oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen, which make up the organic substance termed muscular fibre, and which, in that state or mode of combina tion, possess certain vital properties, possess also a latent capacity for combining in that mode of aggregation termed crystaline, and for exhibiting the solubility, translucency, and other qualities of a salt (all of which are totally opposed to its vital properties, and cannot co-exist with them), when united into the form of cyanate of ammonia. If we were only acquainted with those elements as they exist in organic com pounds, their transposition into a crystaline salt would be almost as marvellous to us as the opposite change is now. If this latent organizability or vitality be admitted (as we con ceive logical proof to have been given that it must) as a pro perty of a large proportion of what we call inorganic matter, is there any such wonderful difficulty in imagining that it may be brought into play in some other manner than by the agency of a pre-existing germ?

The writer of the critique upon this work in the British and Foreign Medical Review, after saying that \" none of the easy solutions which have been offered of the difficult problem presented by the appearance of this aearus can be admitted,\" proceeds to make a few remarks much to the"], [514, "500 NOTES above purpose; and adds\u2014\" Not the least curious part of its (the acarus's) history is the series of metamorphoses which it undergoes before quitting the solution ; these being entirely different from the very slight changes which other acari un dergo after their emersion from the egg. Further, we believe it may be positively asserted, that, in whatever mode these acari are first generated, it is not from eggs ; since, after they have escaped from the solution, they live in the neighbour hood, and readily breed ; and their eggs, which we have our selves seen, are quite large enough to have been readily visible in the solution, had they existed there.\" The metamorphoses here adverted to will perhaps go some way to satisfy those who have objected that the acarus, belonging, as it does, to the articulata, is too high an animal to have been produced otherwise than from ova. I would, nevertheless, remark that the Acarus Crossii is only brought forward as one illustration, and in order that an hypothesis which I think has strong probabilities on its side may have the benefit of any doubts that can be instituted with regard to the production of this creature. The decision of the question against the conclusion here leant to, would still leave much sound illustration, and not in the least affect the general argument. (55.) The objections made to the idea of a parity between advancing organization and the succession of fossils are all in regard to subordinate points, and either rest on assumptions as to the grades of animals which are entirely without solid foundation, or take hold for a feeble support of certain blanks and imperfections in the geological record. One of these objections relates to the occurrence of cepha lopodous mollusca, which, generally speaking, are the most highly organized class of invertebrates, at the first or lowest point in the rock series where distinct fossils are found. The answer is \u2014 (1.) that, in a right view of the genealogies of the animal kingdom, the only predecessors of the cephalopoda"], [515, "NOTES 501 possessing hard parts are certain pteropodous families, whose shells are almost too slight to have had a chance of being preserved; (2.) there is a lower aqueous formation which may have contained remains of lower families of animals, but which has been acknowledgedly so affected by the agency of heat, that any fossils which it ever bore must have been obliterated ; (3.) the first cephalopoda are of low families in tbeir class, and higher genera come afterwards. See, on these points, the section on the Silurian Era, and that regarding the Affinities and Geographical Distribution of Animals. The second great objection rests upon certain peculiarities of the cartilaginous order of fishes, those to which the earliest of the class belonged. While existing specimens of the Car tilagines reach lower down in the scale of organization than the osseous fishes, and while their imperfect vertebral structure, heterocercal tails, and other peculiarities, indicate a general inferiority, some of them present characters in the nervous and reproductive systems, which the osseous fishes do not pos sess. A few are viviparous, and manifest an affection for their offspring. On these partial grounds, an assumption has been built that the fishes commence with the highest forms ! The occurrence of cestraceons in the Upper Silurians is particularly insisted upon as evidence for this conclusion. In reality, the few traits of superiority in the cartilaginous order, even if general to it, which they are not, are light in the scale, against the truly general inferiority. It is well known that no family of the animal kingdom is equally high in all points of structure and endowment, and that many forms, generally humble, have characteristics of a comparatively elevated kind. There are features of even the human organ ization which, if they were to be made an exclusive criterion, would place our race below some of the inferior animals. The partial superiority possessed by certain cartilaginous genera seems partly to relate to tbeir place in creation as destructives : they have a well-developed nervous system to enable them to conquer their prey (see Explanations, pp. 49\u201456). That"], [516, "502 NOTES the nervous system determines the character of the repro ductive system is an admitted law in physiology (see Owen, Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p. 359). To find, then, some of these cartilagines exhibiting a generative system su perior to other fishes, is no true difficulty in our course. On the very same ground, the star-fishes (radiata), where the sexes are in different individuals, are superior to the annelides, (articulata), which present \" an androgynous combination of simple ovaria and testes;\" yet no one would think of describing the radiata generally as superior to the articulata. Or the polypes might be said to be superior to the star -fishes, because in some of them \" the digestive canal presents an \u0153sophagus, a gizzard, a glandular stomach, and an intestine,\" while the latter animals have only \" a radiated sac with one aperture.\" Yet, does any one, for that reason, think of placing the polypes above the star-fishes ? It cannot be pre tended that these and many similar facts are not well known, for they are in every tolerable manual of physiology. Yet, in direct contradiction of them, the opponents of the theory of development persist in asserting that the first fishes in the geological record are the highest in the book of the zoologist ! For further explanations on this point, the reader is referred to the chapter entitled The Affinities and Geographical Dis tribution of Organisms. The early occurrence of fishes, with a peculiarity of structure allying them to the reptilian class, while fishes pos sessing no reptilian affinities come into existence, in large numbers, long afterwards, is sometimes brought forward as one of the proofs that the fish class commenced with its highest forms. In strict fact, the Sauroids are not the first fish : they were preceded in the Upper Silurian formation by Placoids, and in the chart of M. Agassiz (copied in Jameson's Journal, Oct. 1844), they come after another large family of their own order, the Lepidoids. With regard to the subsequent rise of non-reptilian fishes, the reader will see some suggestions"], [517, "503 NOTES in the chapters on The Affinities and Geographical Distribu tion of Organisms. An objection of more recent occurrence arises from certain reptilian remains found in strata, supposed to be of the New Red Sandstone, in South Africa. One portion of these remains indicates an animal more huge than the crocodile. Another goes to form a new lacertian genus, combining characters of the lizard, crocodile, and tortoise, and to which Mr. Owen has given the name of Dicynodon, on account of two canine tusks which projected downwards with an out ward curve from the upper jaw of the animal, the rest of the mouth being horny and toothless. These tusks, both as to their form and internal structure, are regarded as of mamma lian character. Here, too, it is said by the opponents of the development theory, we find traits of superior organization in the earliest animals of a particular class. That these Bidentals, as Mr. Owen more comprehensively calls them, are amongst the earliest reptiles, is by no means ascertained ; for the situation of the strata in which they have been found is unfixed. But, admitting that they were of early occurrence among reptiles, their exhibiting an approxi mation to mammalian dentition cannot truly be regarded as a proof of their being high in their class. AVe know well that a superior development of one organ, more especially an ex ternal one, tells nothing to that effect. The echinus, a mem ber of the echinodermata, is furnished with teeth, while in the superior family of holothuria they are reduced to rudi ments. Muller detected in the scorpion most of the parts which enter into the eye ofthe vertebrated animal, as well as a similaritv in their arrangement, and yet we know how far inferior the scorpion is, on general grounds, to the vertebrate sub-kingdom. The fact is, that animals are endowed with such partial superiorities, when necessary with regard to the circumstances in which they are destined to live ; but their"], [518, "504 NOTES place in the animal scale is to be determined on totally diffe rent considerations. How, if it were otherwise, should we find teeth in certain radiata, and wanting in the great bulk of the mollusca and articulata ? How should we find this branch of organization, which prevails generally in the rep tiles, become extinguished in the superior class of the birds, and even in some of the mammalia (the manatus stelleri, for example) ? In plain truth,* the seizing upon this fact of bidental reptiles as a proof against the development theory, and that before even the place of the strata in which they were found was determined, is only an evidence of the rashness of the counter theorists on this question, and of the weakness of the argu ments by which their opposition is maintained.

Mr. Owen is opposed to the translation ; but it is supported by Mr. Edward New man, a living zoologist of good reputation. The following are Mr. Newman's reasons : \u2014 \" The face of the sloth is round, short, and remarkable for its almost human expression, a character even more observ able in this animal than in the majority of monkeys. The structure ofthe skull and teeth also exhibits some approaches to the monkeys, but none to the ant-eaters. The size, figure, and general external appearance is that of a monkey. The mamm\u00e6 are two only, and these are pectoral. The feet are always used as hands for grasping and climbing, and never as feet for walking or running on the ground. The sloth spends his time entirely in trees, among the branches of which he travels with wonderful rapidity.\" \u2014 System of Nature, 1843. (81.)

In Additions to the fifth edition of his Grace's Elements of Rhetoric, the argument from the Mandans is impugned, on the grounds that there is no proof of their originally having been savages, or of the same race with the other North Americans, or of their civilization not having been introduced from without. Mr. Catlin is also represented as stating in private that he presumed the Mandans, from their external appearance, to be a distinct race. Their distinctness and the independent origin of the civilization I am represented as having assumed, contrary to all logical science. I would reply briefly, that censure on the last point, were it just, would come ill from one who is willing wholly to assume, in this case, the opposite position. It is not just, however ; for were the Mandans, as his Grace supposes, the remains of a civilized people introduced from without, they ought to have had a distinct language, which is not pretended. External peculiarities are precisely those which civilization modifies, and they therefore tell not in the case. Then as to Mr. Cat lin's privately expresse I admission, it is sufficient to refer to"], [523, "NOTES 509 his own words, quoted at a later portion of my text, where he expressly attributes the improvement of the Mandans to the external circumstances to which I in part trace all civili zation. Unprompted, unprejudiced, untampered with testi mony, such as we find in Mr. Catlin's book, seems to me worth considerably more than anything on the opposite side of a merely theoretical nature.

Has not even matter confessedly received from God the power of experiencing, in consequence of impressions from the earlier modifications of matter, certain consciousnesses called sensa tions of the same ? Is not, therefore, the wonder of matter also receiving the consciousnesses of other matter called ideas of the mind a wonder more flowing out of and in analogy with all former wonders, than would be, on the contrary, the wonder of this faculty of the mind not flowing out of any faculties of matter ?

Can we say that God has not in matter itself laid the seeds of every faculty of mind, rather than that he has made the first principle of mind entirely distinct from that of matter ? Cannot the first cause of all we see and know have fraught matter itself, from its very beginning, with all the attributes necessary to develop into mind, as well as he can have from the first made the attributes of mind wholly different from those of matter, only in order afterwards, by an imperceptible and incomprehensible link, to join the two together ? \" * * [The decombination of the matter on which mind rests] is this a reason why mind must be annihilated ?

On the contrary, it promises us a mind like the present, founded on time and space ; since it is, like the present, to hold a certain situation in time, and a certain locality in space; but it pro mises a mind situated in portions of time and of space different from the present : a mind composed of elements of matter more extended, more perfect, and more glorious : a mind which, formed of materials supplied by different globes, is"], [525, "511 NOTES consequently able to see farther into the past, and to think farther into the future, than any mind here existing : a mind which, freed from the partial and uneven combination inci dental to it on this globe, will be exempt from the changes for evil to which, on the present globe, mind as well as matter is liable, and will only thenceforth experience the changes for the better which matter, more justly poised, will alone con tinue to experience : a mind which, no longer fearing the death, the total decomposition, to which it is subject on this globe, will thenceforth continue last and immortal.\" \u2014 Hope, on the Origin and Prospects of Man, 1831.
