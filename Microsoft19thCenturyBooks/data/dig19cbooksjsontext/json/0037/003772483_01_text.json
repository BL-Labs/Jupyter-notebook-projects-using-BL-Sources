The Italians call the Preface, \" la salsa del libro,\" the sauce of the book. In the last edition of that most entertaining work, \" The Curiosities of Literature,\" Mr. DTsraeli has an ingenious essay on Prefaces. \" A Preface,\" he observes, \" being the porch, or the en trance to a book, it ought to be beautiful : a good one,\" he adds, \" is as essential to put the reader into good humour, as a good prologue is to a play, to soothe the auditors into candour, and even into partiality : if well seasoned, it creates an appetite in the reader to devour the book itself.\" Now, though I am but a very moderate literary cook, I am, of course, anxious, so to \" season\" my introductory matter, as to create a t"], [16, "VIII PREFACE. in the reader an appetite to devour my perform ance. I was, indeed, only the other morning, considering with myself the way in which \" this consummation devoutly to be wished \" could be best effected, when in stepped a friend, to whom I had entrusted the sheets of mv work for his candid opinion, and between whom, and the reader's humble servant, the following short dialogue took place. Authoress. Good morning, Sir : I see you have brought back the pages of my humble performance. I tremble to hear your honest judgment upon them. Friend. You have no occasion to tremble, Madam. I have read both your volumes with the greatest care, and am, I assure you, much pleased with their contents. I pronounce your first volume to contain the very best account of Venezia la Ricca, that has hitherto appeared. What title, may I ask, do you purpose giving to your work?"], [17, "PREFACE. IX Authoress. The usual one \u2014 \" Memoirs ;\" or \" Travels ;\" or \" A Journal ;\" or \" A Narrative ;\" or some thing of that general sort. Friend. All \" filthy dowlas,\" Madam ! Why, those are the very titles adopted by the swarm of tourists, who tell nothing, because their method of travelling supplies them with nothing to be told, and in whose volumes there is not any thing to be found, but such general accounts as leave no distinct idea behind them. What a severe castigation has Dr. Johnson given this class of scribblers ! \" He that enters a town at night,\" says the Doctor, \" and surveys it in the morning, and then hastens away to another place, and guesses at the manners of the inhabitants, by the entertainment which his inn afforded him, may please himself for a time with a hasty change of scenes, and a confused remembrance of palaces and churches : he may gratify his eye with a variety of landscapes, and regale his palate with a succession of vintages ; but, let him be"], [18, "X PREFACE. contented to please himself, without endea vouring to disturb others. He that reads these books must consider his labour as its own reward ; for he will find nothing on which attention can fix, or which memory can retain.\" Authoress. Excellent! most excellent! To that descrip tion of travellers, however, you do not, I hope, Sir, consider me to belong ? Friend. Assuredly not, Madam. But hear the Doc tor's concluding observation, which is strikingly applicable to your work : \" He that would travel for the entertainment of others, should remember, that the great object of remark is human life. He only is a useful traveller, who brings home something, by which his country may be benefited ; who procures some supply of want, or some mitigation of evil, which may enable his readers to compare their condition with that of others ; to improve it wherever it is worse, and wherever it is better to enjoy it.\""], [19, "PREFACE.

Bail let, that \" if a title be obscure, it raises a prejudice against the author ; since we are apt to suppose, that an ambiguous title is the effect of an intricate or confused mind.\" Now, from the intense interest which you appear to take in the welfare of the Venetian territory, and the copious details which you have entered into, with regard to its present wretched condition, what think you of \" Venice under the Yoke of France and of Austria ?\" Authoress. It is most felicitous, and shall forthwith be adopted. Friend. A word or two more, Madam, as to our mo dern tourists.

Two of the best books of travels that have appeared for many a day are the productions of ladies. Mariana Starke's \" Information and Directions for Travellers on the Continent,\" is one of the most useful little works ever published. Authoress. It is so: No person should set foot on the Continent without it. Friend. You have given the \" Imperial white-wash ers,\" as you very properly call them, some hard blows. Authoress.

XVI object of my work, and is not without interest in other respects, I shall e'en let it stand as the head-piece of my preface. The facts and anecdotes contained in the following pages, are the result of close observa tion, made during a long residence in Italy ; but more especially in that very interesting portion of it, which has been so little attended to by our modern writers of books of travels, known as the Venetian States. From the opportunities which my rank in life afforded me, of mixing in the first societies, I have been enabled to observe the nobility and gentry of that country in their public, as well as in their private capacity \u2014 in their court eti quette, as well as in their more easy domestic circles. I know the general character of the people of Italy. I have both \" summered them and wintered them.\" I am intimately ac quainted with their local habits, their manners, their customs, their propensities, and particu larly as they affect the interests of my own country : a species of knowledge this, which it is impossible for those superficial doers of"], [25, "P It F, F A C E. XVII books of travels to obtain, who, in nine in stances out of ten, are either ignorant of the language of the country they are attempting to describe, or out of humour and mortified at the difficulty they have found of getting introduced into that good society, by mingling in which, real and genuine information can alone be ob tained. I assure my readers, that I have \" nothing extenuated nor set down aught in malice.\" The facts I have detailed, have either come within my own knowledge, or have been com municated to me by persons of the highest respectability and consequence. Many ofthe anecdotes detailing the rise, progress, decline, and fall of the Buonaparte Family, and their conduct in the Milanese and Venetian territo- ries, will be found highly interesting. Nor are they less true than they are curious. Though I have been a great sufferer by the revolutionary system, and though my husband has been brought to the very verge ofthe grave, and has lost nearly every thing by it, \" hors Phonneur,\" b VOL. I. I"], [26, "XVIII PREFACE. yet have I been too deeply impressed with the sa cred duties of morality and religion, to commit a single line to paper, under the influence of re sentment or of black revenge. As an honest narrator of facts, I have felt it my duty, in describing tlie actual situation of Italy, to go out of the beaten track pursued by most of my contemporaries, and especially in that portion of it, which has been so cruelly treated by the soi-disant regenerators of that ill-fated, but beautiful country. To impartiality, I trust I may fairly lay claim \u2014 \" Tros, Tyriusve mihi nullo discrimine agetur\" \u2014 the conduct of Napoleon, and the conduct of the agents of the Emperor Francis, in Italy, have alike been painted by me in the characters they deserve.

XX In honest truth, the entire of the Doctor's work is calculated to give the people of England a false impression, with regard to the genuine character of Buonaparte and the whole of his family. The Doctor tells us, that \" on leaving Napoleon's presence, he hurried to his chamber, carefully to commit to paper the topics of con versation.\" Of the Doctor's laudable activity, in endeavouring to lay the foundation of that \" posthumous fame,\" which he tells us Buona parte felt \" such a conviction of,\" and that his time was profitably employed, I have no doubt.

If they should find me, now and then, tripping in this respect ; or, occasionally, making rather too free with the King's English ; or, peradven ture, coining a new word or phrase ; I hope they will take the above apology into their generous consideration, and not condemn me to the pu nishment accorded by the statute, \" in that case made and provided.\" With regard to my politics, there again I am fearful I run the risk of occasionally displeasing all parties ; for I cordially acknowledge, that I have sided with none, but have freely con- b 3"], [30, "XXII PREFACE demned in both what appeared to me worthy of reprobation.

It has been truly observed, that the sufferings of the descendants of the brave Romans have, b 4"], [32, "XXIV PREFACE. for ages, had a perennial spring, in the state of things established by their short-sighted rulers. What the situation of Italy was, at the close of the seventeenth century, the reader will have seen from the beautiful lines which I have chosen by way of motto to the present volumes. What the situation of Italy is, at the commence ment of the present century, I have endea voured to shew in the following pages. The remedy \u2014 the sole remedy \u2014 pointed out by that great and good man, Mr. Addison, for the ma nifold miseries which afflicted that fairest por tion of God's globe at the former period, so strikingly continues to be the one that is called for in the present, that I am confident I shall be excused for introducing it at the close of these my prefatory observations.

Deeds of cruelty the most wanton and unheard-of have been exercised towards them ; while submission the most pliant, on the part of the forlorn victims, has but served to render still more obdurate the hearts of the civilized savages, who have taken upon themselves the task of governing this most beautiful, but ill fated portion of the globe. Unhappy Venice ! thy melancholy fate might surely have drawn down upon thee the charity of the whole world! In any age but an age of selfish ness and cold calculation, to have beheld thee alone, would have been sufficient to have called forth the indignation of mankind.

But, in this, as in all things, we discern the finger of that Providence, whose decrees are immutable, and the blind ignorance of frail and feeble mortals. Glad, indeed, should I be, could I honestly exonerate our rulers from the imputation of having assisted in the transfer of the Genoese to the yoke of their ancient foe and inveterate rival, the King of Sardinia ; and happy shall I consider myself, if the earnestness of my language should tend, in however small a degree, to rouse them from the sullen lethargy into which they appear to have fallen, ever since the conclusion of the last peace, and induce them to turn their serious attention to the present alarming situation of the European dominions. Up to that period, in what a different point of view was the Cabinet of St. James's consider ed by the people of the Continent ! But, a fatal verer of the New World, was a native ofthe Republic of Genoa.

The transitions have been too vivid, the extremes too violent. Throughout, there has been an obvious absence of what political painters would call the chiar' oscuro, the due admixture of great with small states ; the generous blending of minor with large powers, which is indispensable to the for mation of that true equilibrium, which, for ages, had served as a city of refuge, and a tower of safety, to all and every member of the great European family, alike against external assailants and domestic traitors. The first infractions of that admirable league are, most probably, to be looked for in the earlier encroachments upon the rights and liberties ofthe people of Poland \u2014 encroachments which, as the brave Kosciusko was accustomed to observe, spread with amazing effect their vulture wings, both in and beyond Europe; and gave rise to the loss of America, the invasion of the Netherlands, the French revolution, the revolution of Spanish America, of Spain herself, and of Portugal \u2022 together with the long list of fatal calamities with which the world has been afflicted, and those which may still await us ; thereby awfully realizing the forebodings of b 3"], [46, "VENICE. the immortal Pitt, when contending, not for a partial re-instatement of things, but for the status quo, whole and entire, unqualified and unbroken. But, it is time for me to return to the Vene tians. And, in earnestly recommending that wise and beneficent people to the fostering regard of Great Britain, I feel that I am only acquitting myself of a duty incumbent on every one who may have had the happiness of residing amongst, and of becoming intimately acquainted with them. As a stupendous monument of human skill and industry, the city of Venice was calculated to have secured to herself the protection of the sovereigns of Europe. Rising out ofthe waves, like the Goddess of Smiles and Graces, and enriched with the gems of Orient, she dazzles the beholder ; who involuntarily exclaims, \" Surely a more appropriate symbol of com mercial advantages can no where be found !\" For centuries was Venice distinguished as the only maritime city in Europe, affording a shelter to vessels infected with the plague, even when driven away from other ports ; and thus were mariners without number snatched from the jaws of death, and millions upon millions of property rescued from the watery deep."], [47, "7 VENICE. True nobility of mind, when thus united to vast political advantages, forms assuredly that precise species of merit, which is the least questionable in the eyes of society. Indeed, the Venetian polity, as history amply bears testimony, was no less sagaciously calculated to neutralize the inroads of popular fury and revo lutionary adventure, than the firm pediments and massy bulwarks of their city to withstand the ragings of the pitiless ocean. As, amidst the latter, her fair towers were seen rising in pride and glory, so were the interests of the Republic found flourishing with the former. The melancholy fate of the unfortunate Ve netians may, indeed, be placed on the list of parricides ; a destiny which, alas, but too com pletely exalts Palma (who painted the day of judgment in their senate-house) to the rank of a prophet. But, what exposes still further this infatuation, on the part of the European powers, is the re-instatement of all the petty princes of Italy in their dominions ; no portion of which dominions is of any importance to England, with the single exception ofthe port of Leghorn. In the name of common sense, then, why should Venice and Genoa, the staunch friends of Eng land and of commerce, be singled out for de struction, and condemned to the most abject b t"], [48, "8 VENICE. thraldom ; while Tuscany, Parma, Modena, Lucca, and other minor states, are left in peace able possession of their former privileges, al though of inferior importance, even when com bined, to the Venetian territory alone ? It is therefore evident, I think, that Venice and Genoa should be restored to their former independent condition. In which event, they would become depositories for British manu factures, and promote their circulation through out the surrounding districts, in preference to the manufactures of powers less mercantile, and therefore less able to afford them equal advantages. But, at present, what is the condition of Italy ? A total stagnation of commerce ! general misery ! And, with regard to the two great maritime cities in question, such has been the rapidity of their decline, that they are mere squalid skeletons of their former selves; pre senting lamentable and striking instances of the instability of earthly grandeur. Splendid palaces falling into decay ; magnificent temples de serted ; and their once opulent inmates reduced to very poverty and rags, and wandering up and down, destitute even of the common necessaries of life! In fine, misery the most abject, ruin the most complete, is apparent on every side ;"], [49, "9 VENICE. with the solitary exception of those dens of usury, the hideous tenants of which are seen battening in the midst of desolation and de struction. In free ports, speculation proceeds with energy. In the event, therefore, ofthe Ligurian and Adriatic commonwealths resuming the atti tude which they presented in the good old times alluded to in the British Parliament by Lord Grenville, the friend and colleague of Pitt, I would venture to propose Leghorn and Trieste, as fit models for imitation. Neither, unless, crouching as it were to Napoleon's plans for shutting us out of the Continent, we are afraid of extending our views beyond an intercourse with a few islands, can I see any reason why we should longer withhold our assistance to suffering humanity ; or delay to extend, like wise politicians, our own inexhaustible resources. To say the truth, the calamities which have been occasioned by war, can alone be com pletely repaired, by the introduction of a just and liberal commercial code, calculated for the whole of Europe; and, in the arrangement and settling of which code, Great Britain, wealthy and powerful as she is, ought to take a prin cipal part. At present, the most shameful pro hibitions are enforced at Venice, against all"], [50, "10 VENICE. merchandize coming from England. In such dread are these same manufactures of ours held by the German impiegati, that, at first sight, one would almost fancy them to be satu rated with the elements of contagion. And, in a certain sense, they may, by comparison, be said to be so ; for I am well convinced, that no manufactures, either for quality or price, can be brought into competition with those which this country is able to supply. Not a servant girl in England would put on the coarse dresses worn, during the morning, by the ladies through out the German dominions. No wonder, then, that British goods should be excluded as much as possible. The old adage, that \" comparisons are odious,\" is here completely applicable ; for I can hardly name an article of manufacture to which what I have been urging does not apply. So decidedly superior are all the productions which we are in the habit of exporting. Napoleon over-reached himself in many in stances ; but in none more completely than by the enactment of his famous decrees against British commerce. For, however much a war of a political character may be unpopular with the people of England, an appeal to arms in defence of their commerce, has uniformly been a favourite with them. The Corsican's man-"], [51, "11 VENICE. dates from Berlin and Milan were, therefore, in every point of view, injudicious. Great indeed is the influence of Austria throughout Italy. Ever since the year 1815, that influence has been spreading with a fearful rapidity, which ought to have roused the atten tion of the reflecting portion of Europe. In addition to her dominions in Lombardy, with the exception of the poor Ionian Islands, she is in possession of the whole of the Venetian States, together with Istria and Dalmatia, coun tries which, time out of mind, have been the nurseries of the most skilful mariners, and the bravest soldiers in Europe ; producing, too, such excellent timber for ship-building, and such capital masts, that Buonaparte directed a supply of them to be conveyed to Toulon, Brest, and the other sea-ports of France. At the present moment, the two-headed eagle bears sway throughout the whole country, from the confines of Savoy, sweeping through the Neapolitan kingdom, back to the hereditary empire. However favourably the conduct of Austria may have been regarded by the unwary portion of the world, who, looking only at one head of the imperial bird, have permitted her progress without suspicion, her formidable alli ance with Russia, Prussia, and all the German"], [52, "12 VENICE. States, with the exception of Bavaria, ought to rouse the jealousy of every one of the powers concerned. Without respect to persons, the designs of inordinate cupidity should be checked; the career of excessive encroachments should be arrested. To advert, for a moment, to the invasion of Spain by France. With what grace can England interfere in behalf either of Spain or her colo nies, if she refuse to assist in the rescue of Piedmont and Naples from the grasp of Austria ? But, expediency is the politician's plea ; and \" expediency\" is certainly a very imposing ex pression. It is irresistibly urgent ; and every way competent, in its bearings on the stage of ambition, to make the actors oppose or submit, advance or recede, assist or abandon. It can palliate crimes, however atrocious. It can blur the virtue of heroes. It can on one day per petrate deeds the most foul and ignominious ; and, on another, perform achievements the most noble and praiseworthy. Call upon politicians to perform their pro mises on the morrow, \u2014 and a future indefinite period is fixed on. Indeed, I may venture to say, from sad experience, that the moment of per formance will never arrive. For, if they really intended to put their promises into execution,"], [53, "13 VENICE. hope, the medicine of the miserable, would not be uniformly administered ; or, at all events, the accomplishment would follow close upon the heels of the promise. When, too, the service is actually rendered, it bears no proportion with the expectations raised, and will have resulted from intermediate causes, novel and unlooked-for at the time of the flattering proffer. Politicians delude but too frequently. The sweets of idle words are gene rally as fatal to the hungry expectant, as honey is to flies. But, besides this, there is a blunt and rude demeanour, which craft can assume \u2014 a vinegar calculated to render palatable the nauseous food\u2014 a sort of sham ignorance, a pretended want of experience, an affected aukwardness, the sharper in the peasant's frock, the hyena in the fable ; \u2014 a mode of deception this, the most pernicious to the world at large."], [54, "CHAPTER II.

While the Venetian noble Giusti, and the late Secretary Orazio Lavezzari, were engaged at Campo Formio, for the restoration of the affairs of the Venetian Republic, and during the residence of Grimani at Vienna as her ac credited ambassador, under the sanction of Buonaparte, transactions involving her total ruin were in preparation. A variety of spe cious pretences, usual on such occasions, were resorted to, to gloss over and extenuate the disgraceful negociation. Amongst other things, it was intimated, that Austria was to give up Italy at the general peace ; and especially, that the Venetian power was to be re-established. And, in this manner, through the mingled guile and ferocity exerted on the one hand, and the hardened inveteracy of a depraved appetite on the other, the venerable Venetian Republic"], [55, "15 VENICE. expired without a groan. A paralysis seized on the whole fabric of her government. No blood was shed, not a wound was inflicted, at her last struggle. The people and the senate were alike benumbed by the force of their terrors ; and, spaniel-like, they fawned at the feet of the Gallic tiger. It was a spectacle at once calculated to excite contempt and pity ; and strikingly evinced the close contiguity that sometimes exists between the two extremes. One tyrant, Attila, the foe to tranquillity and happiness, forced the ancient Heneti, or Veneti, to take refuge in the Lagunes : another tyrant, many centuries after, crushes them in his fiend like embraces. Out of the sensation of alarm, the Venetian power first started ; and, from a similar lapse into consternation, and a supine abandonment of the ordinary resources of a government, it at last fell. Several individuals have, I am aware, been suspected of treachery; but, imputations of this kind will, I am confident, have no weight with persons accustomed to reflect, and to judge for themselves. Is it at all probable, that the Vene tian Senate, whose boasted policy it uniformly was to invest no individual with extraordinary responsibility, would, at a crisis so momentous, deposit an extreme plenitude of power in the"], [56, "16 VENICE. hands of any particular delegate ? That Buona parte endeavoured to win over to his side some of the nobles is highly probable ; but, that a single man among them was sincerely his friend, I can never believe. No, no ! the excellent Venetians had no traitors among them, but sluggishness and moral prostration, at a period of considerable excitement in the world of in tellect, and when the fires of revolution were blazing throughout Europe. Closing their eyes against the impending tempest \u2014 for aVenetian seldom looked into a book \u2014 they were at a loss how to act, when it at length reached their sea-girt city. On the arrival of foreigners at Venice, a voluptuous train of diversions, unaccompanied with any remarkable tokens of manly energy, principally attracted their attention. Had a well-appointed army of brave and faithful Sclavonians \u2014 a race at all times strongly at tached to the Republic \u2014 been kept up and occasionally reviewed ; had but a small sprink ling of the martial elements obtained a footing amidst the Paphian amusements of the city, a far different fate would, in all probability, have befallen the Venetians. Presaging, from the decrepitude of the Re public, and its sluggish aversion to every thing"], [57, "17 VENICE. military, the great Lord Chesterfield foretold, that they would one day become the easy prey of the first armed potentate who should think fit to attack them. When the French Revolu tion broke out, in so degraded a light was the military profession viewed by the Venetians, that \" Signor Ufficiale,\" mister officer, was ac tually a term of reproach and utter contempt. At that period, a noble Venetian would no more think of sending, or of accepting a challenge, than a general would think of having a tilting bout with a subaltern, an admiral with one of his midshipmen, or a member of parliament with his own valet-de-chambre. If an English gen tleman in a crowd had happened to jostle a Venetian Don, and a quarrel ensued, the lat ter, in answer to a challenge, would merely desire the former to go about his business, after calling him \" un' elefanto !\" At present, how ever, things are somewhat different ; and well attested instances are not rare, in which the youthful descendants of the Venetian Peers have displayed a courage and a magnanimity of character, worthy of the best days of the Republic. In all ages, the Venetians have been dis tinguished for an over-cautious policy \u2014 a quality which is necessarily unfriendly to the growth vol. i. c"], [58, "18 VENICE. of true courage. A governor of men may not in aptly be compared to a palqfreniere, or groom of the stable. The over-cautious gentry of whom I am speaking resorted too much to ordinances, serving as curbs, snaffles, and bits, which de prived the noble animal of that due portion of mettle, which was actually necessary to render him useful, Not that I am, by any means, an advocate for that rude barbarism, which, after a short effort, sinks back into listlessness ; but rather that Roman union of intellect with moral refinement and intrepidity. As for the stigma cast on the Fine Arts, imputing to them a direct tendency to sensual irregularities, like many other subterfuges of depraved understandings, false in one instance, it is generally erroneous in every other. The subversion of kingdoms is occasioned by vice ; and never by the introduction of the elegant arts, which uniformly tread in the footsteps of nature. No one, possessing a grain of common sense, can be made to believe, that political decline can be compatible with an approxima tion to Nature, every property of which is firm, continuous, and enduring ; \" Unerring Nature, still divinely bright, \" One clear, unchang'd, and universal light !\" But, more of this hereafter."], [59, "VENICE. 19 Now, if we turn our view but a few years back, we shall find, that the mighty empire of Austria had so far dwindled before the arms of Napoleon, that Francis condescended to ac- knowledge that he held it in vassalage ; thereby retrograding, as it were, at least seventy years. The Corsican compelled him to assume the title of Francis the First; a title which had been already borne by the husband of Maria Theresa, so far back as the year 1745. Although Buonaparte had made numerous Kings, whom he held in a state of abject subjection, Francis was his first Emperor ; and the frail tenure of their power, and their tame submission to the fiat of the Gallic Chief, may be gathered from the far-famed decrees which he issued from Berlin and Milan, ordaining the destruction by fire of British merchandize, of whatever des- cription, not only immediately throughout his own dominions, but, by implication, in every country dependent upon him. Like the Grand Signior, he had only to send about the silken cord \u2014 the Turk's hint ; a sort of Irish insinua- tion, not easily to be misunderstood, and which was every where attended to. But, what was the ultimate effect of this measure ? Why this : it inspired Great Britain with redoubled strength ; and accordingly, unaided by the rest of Europe, c 2"], [60, "20 VENICE. single-handed she overturned the plans which had been laid for her destruction ; and, instead of sinking in the tremendous conflict, she over whelmed her opponents, and rose, like another ph\u0153nix, out ofthe ashes. So much for Buonaparte's burning system : the sole effect of which was, to kindle the fire of the British lion. Whenever the French ruler wished to draw money out of the pockets of his subjects \u2014 whose hatred of the English nation he always took especial care to excite \u2014 he had only to say that it was wanted for the purpose of attacking us, and the necessary supplies were immediately forthcoming. So great was the animosity against this country, which at that time rankled in the bosoms of our opposite neighbours! And, that animosity, I am sorry to say, still subsists : \" h cambiatoil maestro di capella, rrta la musica e sempre quella,\" \u2014 the ruler is changed, but the system continues the same. It was, however, the rock on which Napoleon's greatness at last foundered. To British per severance, then, in the contest, do the mo narchs of Europe, yclept \" legitimate,\" owe, in no small degree, their salvation. And, what is the return they have made us ? They have persevered in the prohibitory system, to the great injury of their own subjects. Instead of"], [61, "21 VENICE. conforming themselves to the obligations imposed on regular sovereigns, bound to consult wise counsellors and to adopt salutary laws, they have chosen to walk in the footsteps of a lawless military chief. An inconsistency this, which is past comprehension ! CHAPTER III. VENICE.

Had Buonaparte continued to reign, every vestige of popular commotion would have been obliterated, and every record of revolutionary tumult would have been destroyed. The prisons, of which the world has heard such shocking descriptions, no longer exist. Napoleon had determined never to enter the walls of the same dungeon, in which the unfortunate Louis and his c 3"], [62, "22 VENICE. family had been incarcerated. The prison of the Temple, therefore, has disappeared from the face of the earth. At Lyons, too, the ruins occasioned by intestine war have been cleared away, and a magnificent square has been erected on the spot. Many other alterations took place under his direction ; evidently for the purpose of obliterating the remembrance of popular devas- tations, committed during the levelling period which had so recently gone by. Nor are these traces of his ingenuity, as a despot of the most ambitious and selfish description, confined to France alone. Proofs of his determination to work an entire change in the face of things are even more striking in other countries. At Venice, for instance, he caused every symbol of the old regime to be effaced. The Winged Horse of that once famous Republic he ordered to be obliterated, however destructive such re- moval might be to architectural symmetry. Selfish and envious, he could not brook a com- petitor ; and, wherever he found himself unable to equal or surpass some existing structure, in his headlong rage for singularity and fame, he would tarnish its lustre and deface its beauty. To some of my readers these strictures may appear invidious. But, truth is the guide of my pen ; and, to prove the correctness of my"], [63, "VENICE. 23 position, I refer them to the once magnificent Piazza di San Marco, at Venice, which has been totally disfigured by the wing which Na poleon caused to be added thereto, during his occupancy of Italy, no doubt with the ostensible object of completing that square, and of thereby holding himself up as the projector and finisher of public works, which no mortal but himself was capable of setting about. Other instances of his pruriency for undertakings of this sort are to be found in the Louvre, and in the Duomo, or cathedral, of Milan. His completion, how ever, of the opposite wing of the former, and of the facade of the latter, afford but miserable specimens of the taste of the French Emperor ; or rather, perhaps, the taste of his architect. Buonaparte's Vandalic mutilations at Venice have been sadly repaid to his manes. Not a whit more of his marmorean \u2014 lignean \u2014 metallic, constructions, bearing his name, and titles, and personal emblems, are at this moment to be seen in any corner of his once boundless empire, than if \"Napoleon le Grand \" had never existed. Sic transit gloria mundi ! What one man can raise up, another can pull down. God only is omnipotent, and His works eternal. The Romans, in the zenith of their glory, set about every public measure under the \u00e6gis of augury. At c 4"], [64, "24 VENICE. least, they endeavoured, to the best of their abilities, to find out the exact moment and the precise manner of setting about the undertaking; and the surest test of their sincerity is perhaps to be found, in the success with which their exertions were usually crowned. We know they were occasionally cruel and unjust : but, in their general conduct and character, we dis cover a sincere reverence for the Gods. Of the grandeur, the correct judgment, and the pure taste of the ancient Romans, the best proofs extant, or those which at least are as good as any other, are the remains of their public edifices; their forms, the object with which they were erected, and the uses to which they were applied. Now, in the name of common sense, why place a triumphal arch, intended to resemble the memorials, always erected on the public ways, in honour of the Latin victors, in the centre of a square, and under which no one passes? And yet this blunder has Napoleon committed in the Place du Carousel. To build churches, raise palaces, and enact laws, are matters of no rare occurrence. In the con struction of his code, he consulted every man, throughout his vast empire, pretending to the least smattering of jurisprudence. Those who happened to be fond of law, he was determined"], [65, "25 VENICE. to supply to their very hearts' content. But, if we may form an opinion from the results, no ho nours can be fairly awarded to the Gallic chief. Failing ultimately in all his projects, he has no claim, as an individual, to the extraordinary political sagacity which has been attributed to him, since his overthrow, by the very persons, probably, who were the most anxious to run down his talents while prosperity was every where the attendant of his career. As in his architectural undertakings he shewed himself a barbarian, so in his schemes of government was he equally unsuccessful. Religion, or the sin cere humiliation of the soul before the Deity, was the subject which he appeared least of all to have understood. After this, that the Na poleon system of ethics should be held up as a model worthy of imitation, and that his policy should be considered the oracle for legislators, are among the most extraordinary signs of the present very extraordinary times ! After the battle of Austerlitz, a suspension of arms was agreed upon ; and a conference was appointed to settle the preliminaries of peace, which immediately followed between the French Emperor and the monarchs of Russia and Prussia. It was agreed, that the place of meet ing between the sovereigns should be a barge,"], [66, "26 VENICE. then lying in the river, at which the three monarchs were to arrive at one and the same time ; not unlike the etiquette which was ob served between Octavius, Lepidus, and Mark Antony, the execrable murderers of the im mortal Cicero. Buonaparte was the first who entered the boat ; but, the Emperor of Russia venturing to take the precedency of the Mame luke, the well-known constant attendant and salva guardia of Napoleon, the little man in stantly turned round, and darted one of his Corsican looks at the Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia, intimating that it was his pleasure that this Asiatic slave should enter first. Necessitas non habel legem. There was no retreating. The Monarchs took the hint, and actually followed in the rear ofthe Mameluke ! For sovereigns who could thus sacrifice their private feelings to the good of their subjects, I am disposed to entertain all due respect ; and I Jiave only recorded the fact, for the sake of shewing the world to what a pitch of degrada- tion these royal personages had arrived, pre- viously to the conclusion of the wished-for peace. Where, then, is the man who must not rejoice at the downfall of a mountebank upstart, who could so far forget the respect which is ever due to fallen majesty, as to compel those"], [67, "VENICE. 27 sovereigns to follow in the train of a contemp tible slave? After this, what right had Buona parte, when, in consequence of the battle of Waterloo, he was forced to surrender himself to the nation which he had so often stigmatized as a nest of pirates, to expect that any sympathy should be shown towards him ? Truly, the meanness of this man in adversity, was only equalled by his unbounded arrogance in pros perity ! It has been asserted, by those who were in his immediate confidence, that when informed that it was Wellington who had for ever annihilated his power, and not Blucher \u2014 for whom he enter- tained a deadly hatred \u2014 tears involuntarily gushed from those eyes, which, unmoved, had beheld the massacre of the poor Venetians at Verona ; the murder of Pichegru, D'Enghien, and Captain Wright ; the arrest of the innocent * * *, who was obliged to flee to Malta ; and the ruinous process against her husband, be- cause she would not consent to become a spy upon England, her native country. Had he not been guilty of enormities like these, to- gether with the treacherous sale of the Venetian Republic, at the very moment that his army was preserved form starvation by its government; and the barbarous murder, in cold blood, of the"], [68, "28 VENICE. Count Augustin Di Verita and others at Verona; he never would have been doomed, by a gene rous nation, to end his days on the barren rock of St. Helena. True courage is ever magnanimous. In modern times, however, it is too much a mere word, \u2014 vox et pr\u0153terea nihil. The brave man may be conquered, but he will never so far degrade himself as to kiss the feet of his conqueror. Galgacus was never more a prince \u2014 and a British prince, too \u2014 than when he was standing in chains before the Roman Emperor. To return, however, to the Sovereigns. It is impossible to divest one's-self of the conviction, that it is to the timidity of their ministers, and not to the peril of enterprize \u2014 to their narrow minded policy, and not to the extensiveness of their views \u2014 that we are to attribute the warlike aspect which Europe will most likely shortly be obliged to assume, from their neutral conduct towards the infidel oppressors of Greek civili zation and of the Christian religion, as well as their unrighteous interference against the praise worthy Spaniards; who, actuated by far different principles, have won over the majority of civi lized nations to their interest. For the very sub jects of those Sovereigns, who are now actually engaged in suppressing national liberty and in-"], [69, "29 VENICE. dependence, will themselves one day step for ward, to assist in the general emancipation from human slavery. At once ignorant, bigotted, feeble, and in continual dread of the natural progress of free dom, the mis-named Holy Alliance are combin ing \u2014 most un-holily and most sacrilegiously \u2014 to effect the overthrow of all liberal thinking. Impolitically fancying, that a state of freedom is incompatible with the safety of their thrones, they are for strangling the infant in its cradle; well aware that they would hereafter be obliged to crouch to its manhood. But liberty, like wisdom, proceeding from the head of the Thunderer, comes forth arrayed cap a pied. Her power is irresistible ; her influence univer sal. Her voice, therefore, will be heard, and her dictates obeyed; when the short-sighted and narrow-minded mortals who would arraign her at the bar of despotic prejudices shall have sunk into oblivion, or be only recollected with sensations of pity and contempt. The necessity which exists for a full partici pation in the enjoyment of that inestimable blessing, will strikingly appear, from a faithful detail of proceedings which have, from the foolish and mistaken policy of its several go vernments, been carrying on against the free-"], [70, "30 VENICE. born subjects of Italy, and, in particular, against the Venetians. Her pecidiar position, and fourteen years of uninterrupted experience, sufficiently shew, that Venice can alone be prosperous, under a government congenial to her soil and local si tuation. Nor can she prove of any, but of tem porary and fleeting advantage, to the barbarism ofthe usurper, who would batten on the spoils of native genius, to the total extinguishment ofthe immortal motives, which gave birth to her pri mitive attachment to liberty and independence. It is well known, that seeds which are prolific in one soil, often turn out unproductive when sown in another. So it is with governments. That which is best calculated for the happiness of one race of men, may prove altogether un friendly to the well-being of another. The prosperity of a country may depend, as much on the disposition of its inhabitants, as on the wisdom of its laws ; which must be adapted to the climate, the soil, and the general habits of the people who are to be governed by them. Now, the Venetians differ as widely in dis position, in manners, and in customs, from every other race of beings, as the element on which their city stands differs from the air. They may be compared to that sagacious creature, the"], [71, "31 VENICE. amphibious beaver. The policy which ever governed their intercourse with neighbouring and foreign nations, far exceeds the policy which generally actuates statesmen. Those who have had the opportunity of attentively observing, or inquiring into, the conduct of this very extraordinary people, will acknowledge that my description of them is not exaggerated, and proceeds from careful observation, during a long residence in the country, and from that free and unrestrained intercourse with every class of its inhabitants, from which alone ge nuine experience can be acquired. In my humble opinion, the first considerations of a government bearing sway over a newly acquired territory, ought to be directed to the general character of its people, as well as to its soil, climate, and element ; by an attention to which, much care and inconvenience would be avoided by its governors, and an incalculable degree of dissatisfaction and irritation would be spared to the people about to be governed. Is there on earth a law which justifies, either the aggressions which have been made on Ita lian independence, with the connivance of the Holy Alliance, or the more recent conduct of France towards Spain ? It requires neither the aid of a microscope, nor the wisdom of a Plato,"], [72, "32 VENICE. nor the sagacity of a British statesman of the old school, to discover, that when the Austrians crossed the Po, to take an unprincipled posses sion of Naples, they had, both in their rear and flank, their most powerful enemies j and that, had the Neapolitans been commanded by men, instead of automata, they would have given them sufficient occupation. Genoa and Piedmont had declared themselves in favour of the same cause ; and the Milanese only waited for a favourable movement, to join against the common enemy. If Austria had been so far worsted as to have been under the necessity of adding another to her numerous retrograde movements, the emancipation of Italy would have been ensured, and the total des truction of the invading army would have been the consequence. As my work is of a miscellaneous description, that I may not fatigue the reader with too long a detail of the transactions which distinguish, as much as they disgrace, the nineteenth century, let me here withdraw his attention, for a moment, from the melancholy narrative, and introduce a short fable, which will be found extremely ap plicable to a certain event which has taken place in the American seas, at the instigation of one of the Northern powers ; and the proceeding"], [73, "33 VENICE. which will, most probably, take place on the part of other branches ofthe Holy Alliance. An old rat, who had long been on the watch for the unpacking of a case of provisions, which she intended to appropriate to her own use, summoned together a congress of voracious animals of her own kidney. Being assembled, she harangued them most philanthropically, and expressed her unbounded zeal for the general welfare. She solemnly assured them, that she entertained no selfish wish to partici pate in the common spoils, but was solely anxious to co-operate in bringing about such a reform as the times demanded ; and that, such being the case, she should withdraw from the busy world, and claim no more, for her share, than what was barely necessary to supply the cravings of nature. Having concluded her harangue, she retired. One of the conclave, however, less credulous than the rest, followed on tip-toe the disinterested member of the long tailed sisterhood ; when, lo ! instead of putting in practice her boasted moderation, she was found snugly nestled in the middle of a huge Westphalia ham ! I leave my reader to draw his own inference ; only observing, that Russian rats are reported to have an amazing attachment to Indian crackers ; Austrian rats to Swiss gru- VOL. I.

To return to the present condition of Venice, and her miserable inhabitants. No people in Europe groan under a weightier load of oppres sion than the Venetians. The laws by which they are governed are little understood, either by Plenzit, the soi-disant Solon, who framed them, or by those whose duty it is to put them in execution. From the many contradictions with which they abound, and their innumerable violations of common law and common sense, I"], [75, "35 VENICE. have been informed, that the gentlemen of the bar, Germans as well as Italians, waited upon the great lawgiver previously to their being acted upon, and solicited of him, for their own guidance, an explanation of the numerous ob scure and equivocal clauses in which they abounded. The only answer they could obtain from the modern Lycurgus was \u2014 \" I have drawn up this code of laws. Apply but yourselves to the study of them, and their intent and meaning will become abundantly apparent.\" This sagacious reply recals to my recollec tion a certain action, which was tried, some years ago, before the famous Lord Mansfield, respecting some cockets. These same cockets were found to be written in so miserable a hand, that his Lordship directed the writer of them to be sent for. When he appeared in court, the learned Judge asked him, whether he was actually the writer of these cockets ? \" Yes, please your Lordship,\" said the man. \" Then,\" replied the Judge, \" they are so illegible, that I have sent for you to explain them.\" \u2014 \" I am aware of that,\" rejoined the scribe; \"but I am only a icriter of cockets, my Lord, not a reader of them.\" So, like this sagacious cocket-writer, has Plenzit left his laws unexplained and unintelligible \u2014 doubtless for the more speedy redress and con- d2"], [76, "36 VENICE. solation ofthe poor unfortunate Venetians, who are to be nurtured with the pith and marrow of these precious legislative enactments ! This mutilator ofthe jurisprudence of the immortal Justinian has been heard to declare, that he could discover nothing in the Institutes of that great man in the least worthy of being re tained. This declaration of Mr. Solon Plenzit reminds me of those gothic barbarians of the present enlightened age, who modestly undertake to improve and render more perfect the writings of our divine Shakespeare ; and who, the better to avoid a comparison of his immortal verses with their own vapid and disjointed trash, shrewdly take care, when they set about me tamorphosing one of his matchless plays into a senseless and despicable opera, to expunge the entire of the original. I have often won dered, that these impudent transformers of sterling comedies into miserable burlettas, should never, in their \" sway of vanity,\" have fancied themselves qualified to fill the role allot ted to the primo buffo. In Venice, and throughout the Venetian States, all criminal proceedings are entirely carried on in writing : so that a man may be accused, tried, condemned, and even executed,"], [77, "37 VENICE. without ever beholding the face of his judge, or being confronted with his accusers. Many of these judges are totally ignorant, not merely of the jurisprudence, but even of the language of Italy ; it being the practice at Vienna, when any one of the clod-hopping gentry from the Tyrole happens to come to the capital and be out of employ, though he may even have been acobler, to transform him, presto, into a judge, and dispatch him, in that capacity, to Venice. If, perchance, the man happens to be honest, his appearance belies his character : for he has more the semblance of a culprit than the pre sident of a court of judicature. This, however, is a misfortune, and not a crime ; and is, be sides, of no great consequence ; seeing that these Austrian dispensers of the law, like those of the Areopagus at Athens, never behold the object of their deliberations.* * In the early days ofthe Grecian Republic, the character of its inhabitants was so strictly moral, that when the vices of a malefactor became publicly exposed, he showed such a sense of his past errors, as to excite the compassion of the judges to such a degree, as often to defeat the ends of justice. In order to prevent this, when the increased riches and popu lation of the Republic increased the number of crimes, it was decreed, that in all criminal trials, a curtain should be drawn to separate the one from the other. The custom existed in Athens in the time of Demosthenes. D 3"], [78, "38 VENICE. The civil proceedings in the Venetian States are now superintended by a president of the tribunal, who has eight magistrates under his direction. The cases are all forwarded to him ; and it is his duty to distribute them to these different judges, who are bound never to decide on any case, unless five out of the eight should be present : the number, however, very often does not extend beyond three. These men act in the treble capacity of advocate, judge, and juror. No counsel are permitted to argue the case pro or con; and the mischief is, that these judges often come into court without having made themselves acquainted with their briefs. Many of them, as I before hinted, are actually Germans, Hungarians, or Bohemians, who have been sent to the Venetian States, entirely ig norant of the language, manners, and customs of the people, amongst whom it is their duty faithfully to dispense law and justice. Dispatch of business depends, therefore, more on the appetites of these gentry, than on their industry or sense of duty : for the reader will agree with me, that it would be most unreasonable to expect, that a German Judge should forego his dinner, for the sake of a pastry Italian law-suit ! There is, it is true, a Court of Appeal, as it is called. But then, this court is too polite and"], [79, "39 VENICE. too well-bred to disturb a former decision ; and therefore it makes an uniform practice never to impugn, but invariably to confirm, all previous judgments\u2014 unless, indeed, certain weighty ar guments should induce them to interpose ! The wealthy client has it constantly in his power to induce his judges to hasten or pro crastinate their decision, according to the quan tity and quality of the metal which is thrown into the scale, for the purpose of counteracting the workings of conscience, and securing a favourable verdict : it being a well established fact, that solid reasons of this description have never been adduced, without operating the de sired effect. And, certainly, when we consider how wretchedly these men are paid by the Austrian government \u2014 if we could possibly ima gine an excuse for taking a bribe for the mal administration of justice, it would be in the case of these long-eared judges. But, besides this, the greatest abuses take place, from the length of time which is suffered to intervene between the sentence of the court and its final execu tion ; by which delay, even this mockery and mere show of justice is defeated, from the oppor tunity of concealing, or of making away with his effects, which it affords to the fraudulent debtor. By the laws of Austria, no landlord can turn d 4"], [80, "40 VENICE. his tenants away from his estate, but by a three years' notice to quit, though those tenants may be in arrears to him for rent, and are known to be in the practice of embezzling the produce, to the injury, and even utter ruin of the pro- prietor ; since, from the non-payment of his tenant, he is unable to make good his own taxes. The government, however, enforces immediate payment from the landlord, by selling his effects for about a third of their real value ; though, by law, they ought not to be disposed of under less than two-thirds. But the time between the seizure and the actual sale is extremely short. The greedy speculator on human misery takes, therefore, every advantage ; whilst the agents of government, anxious to transmit to the Austrian treasury all the revenue they can possibly collect, sell the property for whatever it will fetch, rather than retain it ; lest a fall in the price of the produce should render it still less valuable. In this way have thousands of the best patrician families, as well as many of the most respectable private citizens of Venice, been utterly ruined; though some of them have actually been, at the time, creditors of the Aus- trian government to a considerable amount, for arrears of principal and interest of money which they had lent to it !"], [81, "41 VENICE. When these distressing circumstances take place, the unhappy creditors apply, very natu rally, to the government, for a liquidation of the debt due to them, to prevent the seizure and sacrifice of their property. In case the govern ment should not be prepared to advance the whole, or any part of the money it had bor rowed, they at least implore it to strike a balance. To which the humble supplicant re ceives the consoling answer \u2014 solve aut arepit ! Under the Austrian sway at Venice, the public taxes are usually rented out by the go vernment to a sort of middle men \u2014 a class of persons, destitute alike of character and of pro perty ; but who, from the enormous exactions which the government allows them to inflict on the unfortunate creatures, who, from the causes I have just mentioned, and the low price of agricultural produce, may not be prepared to make good their payments \u2014 are enabled to give extravagant premiums to individuals who hap pen to possess unincumbered landed property ; which property, for these considerations, they pledge to the government, in the way of gua rantee for the punctuality of these tax col lectors. As these villainous middle men are in the practice of holding out exorbitant premiums of"], [82, "42 VENICE. thirty or forty per cent., many a credulous no bleman has fallen a victim to his own avarice, and has thereby lost the whole of his substance : for, at the expiration of eight days from the time fixed for the paying in of these taxes to the public treasury, the government seizes upon the estates of the unhappy guarantee, and dis poses of them, without loss of time, to the best bidder. Some of these tax-gatherers have taken to their heels, when they have found themselves unable to collect a sufficient sum, before the expiration of the two months allowed for the payments. Others have contrived to make good their engagements by the following device : the wretched farmers, and landed proprietors, when their estates are seized on for arrears of taxes, in order to obtain a suspension, or indul gence, for a short time, are glad to make great sacrifices to the local authorities, both in money and effects ; besides giving their land and its produce, by way of security for the due fulfil ment of the exorbitant engagement. This in dulgence they are under the necessity of renew ing every eight or ten days, making every time some fresh sacrifice. And, when at length these local authorities, who are in league with the tax-collectors, discover that they can no"], [83, "VENICE. 43 longer spunge upon the unhappy victims of cupidity, they dispose of their effects at a mock auction, for a twelfth of their value \u2014 become themselves, under fictitious names, the actual purchasers \u2014 sell them again for their real value \u2014 fix the credulous proprietor with the gua rantee to government \u2014 and, finally, decamp with the plunder ! When my reader considers, that agricultural produce does not at present fetch, throughout the Venetian States, more than a tenth part of its former price, he will at once see, that it is morally as well as physically impossible for the people to pay the present enormous amount of taxes. They are, nevertheless, now called upon, when the sack of corn of four bushels sells for only seven francs, to pay as much as they were called upon to pay when the same quantity sold for fifty francs. Every other commodity bears the same proportion : for, throughout Italy, corn is the standard by which the price of every article is regulated, and consequently rises or falls. But, though there is now this astonishing difference, the government has hitherto turned a deaf ear to the heart-rending complaints of its miserable subjects. At Venice, the currency chiefly consists of a base metal, with which the government pays"], [84, "44 VENICE. both its civil and military servants : nevertheless, it will only take to the extent of a third part of the public taxes in this almost valueless coin ; the other two-thirds it insists upon receiving in gold. And, as the revenue is collected every two months, genuine specie is become a regular article of speculation, and, at these stated periods, is with difficulty to be procured at any rate ; for those who are employed in collecting the taxes, make a point of monopolizing, every two months, all the national money. Against this there is no remedy. The decrees of the government are rigidly enforced ; and in case the good currency is not forthcoming, the de faulter has an additional five per cent, added to the two-thirds of the taxes which should have been paid in sterling gold. This is the first instance, I believe, of any government depreciating its credit, by thus dis gracefully refusing to take back its own de based circulating medium, in payment of taxes. Heaven grant it may be the last ! for it is cer tainly a practice \" More honour'd in the breach, than in th' observance.\""], [85, "45 CHAPTER V. VENICE.

Generally speaking, the Venetians are gentle, affable, polite, courteous, hospitable, and more civilized and better informed than the inhabi tants of any other part of Italy. Their conver sation is at once entertaining and instructive. The vast number of men of talent, in every art and science, to which the Republic has given birth, is a proof that its lakes are as abundant in genius, as they are fertile in the productions of their native element. To mention only a few of the illustrious names who have rendered the Venetian nation immortal \u2014 Titus Livius, Pe trarca, Trissino,* Algarotti, Goldoni, Titian, * Voltaire acknowledges, that it was the perusal of the writings of this great Venetian dramatist, that first induced him to set about the greater part of his theatrical produc tions ; and especially his \" Sofonisbe,\" which is little more than a copy of the Italian, adapted to tlie French stage."], [86, "46 VENICE. Tintoretto, Paul Veronese, Palladio, Sansovino, Scarlati, Buranello, Bertoni, Tartini, Canova, &c. are names which, in their respective de partments, remain unrivalled, and will be the admiration of the world, as long as mankind shall continue to entertain a taste for science and the fine arts. As navigators, the Venetians claim the foremost rank ; as warriors, they stand on an equality with the bravest ; and as politicians, they are superior to every other civilized nation in Europe. The men are above the middle stature, rather inclined to be tall, and remarkably well made. They have good clear complexions, fine ex pressive countenances, with an elegant and easy deportment. So remarkably constant are they in their attachments, that it is no uncommon thing to hear of friendships, between the sexes, of fifty and sixty years' standing. A Venetian rarely abandons the object of his primitive affec tion, except for ill-treatment or infidelity ; and, even in those instances, he never fails to lend her his assistance, should she happen to stand in need of it. The females, who, generally speaking, are handsome, have very fine figures, with beauti fully clear skins, expressive features, and eyes that penetrate the inmost recesses of the soul."], [87, "VENICE. 47 They are interestingly delicate in their external manners and in their language ; the Venetian being, of all the dialects of Italy, the most agreeable. In the mouth of a genteel Donna Veneziana, it adds to the native grace of her carriage, and never fails to charm and delight the ear of a stranger ; especially when it happens to be placed in contrast with the vulgar Lom bardian jargon. They are remarkably attentive to foreigners ; though they rarely form a tender attachment for them. When, however, such an attachment does take place, it is usually most passionate and sincere. The societies at Venice, whether at private houses or at the public casinos, are generally enlivened with the smiling eyes, and gentle and fascinating looks of the fair sex, and are con ducted with an elegance and an ease superior to most other female societies ; and without any of that discordant rivalship of prerogatives, too often to be met with elsewhere. The casinos are conducted much in the same man ner as the subscription houses in London ; where the members are at liberty to do as they please ; with this especial difference, that the ladies only are subscribers, the gentlemen being honorary members. Strangers of respectability, of both sexes, are readily admitted, and meet"], [88, "48 VENICE. with a polite and affable reception. The com pany are entertained with a concert, and treated with refreshments. Cards are introduced at the wish of any of the party ; and other amuse ments, except those of hazard. These casinos are furnished in the most costly and elegant style, and are brilliantly lighted up with the beautiful wax candles for which Venice is so justly celebrated. The regularity, the order, and the magnifi cence which prevail at these princely casinos, at once discover the ladies of Venice to be a superior race of beings to their neighbours of the Terra Firma. In their conversation they are lively and unaffected without levity, and com municative and affable without coquetry. The uncommon share of freedom which these ladies enjoy, induces foreigners, who have but a superficial knowledge of them, to form an opinion of them very different from that which they really deserve. My observations, of course, apply solely to good society. The mixed classes of every country have their chiaro scuro. The Venetian ladies are extremely engaging in their manners ; and as to their dress, it may be called becoming rather than fashionable, and sets off their fine figures to the greatest advan tage. It is not unusual for them to be married"], [89, "49 VENICE. to men whom they have never before seen, except through the grate of the convent in which they have been educated, and which they only quit to enter into the gay world, through the temple of Hymen \u2014 where Cupid rarely presides, beyond the honey-moon ! And, to this very liberty, which they enjoy the moment they are married, is it to be ascribed, that they are usually not so capricious as the Italians of the south, who are more rigorously subjected to antiquated external formalities. If the experience of twenty years, obtained by a residence amongst, and a constant inter course with, the highest orders of society, can justify me in hazarding an opinion, I may ven ture to pronounce the ladies of Venice worthy of our best esteem. There is a wide difference between an easy, unrestrained carriage, and that looseness of conduct, which is but too apt to be confounded with it. At one period, the Venetians were so sus picious of their wives and daughters, that they never allowed them to walk out ; and, to pre vent their doing so, they even obliged them to wear exceedingly high-heeled shoes, which, as it were, suspended the foot from the toe up wards, raising the other extremity nearly ten inches, and making it almost parallel with the VOL. I. E"], [90, "50 VENICE. leg ; in consequence of which, their feet became cramped like those of the Chinese. Some of these shoes I have often seen, in the palace of the truly estimable Madame Damula Pisani. The usual dresses of the noble Venetians, in the time of the Republic, somewhat resembled the black gowns worn by our judges, having ermine on one side. The robes of ceremony were of crimson damask, very long ; and they were habited in full-powdered wigs, like those worn by the gentlemen of the bar. This was the usual dress of the Doge ; except on special occasions, when he wore one made of gold brocade, with a massy gold chain round his neck, and a coronet on his head of the same materials, over a wig and velvet cap. The dress of the noble ladies was a rich black velvet, according to the season, a skirt with a long train, a coloured body and sleeves, and a black silk veil that covered the head and shoulders, was crossed on the neck and round the waist, and fell tastefully behind on the black skirt. It was generally trimmed with black lace, and was very becoming when pro perly put on. Under the veil they wore a ske leton wire shape, to keep it from falling on the face, which was called vesta e sendal. Foreigners generally adopted this dress on their arrival at"], [91, "51 VENICE. Venice : but few could put them on so tastily as the natives. I recollect that Madame Mara, when singing at Venice, always wore this dress during the morning ; and she was accustomed to say, that she never pleased her auditors more than when she was thus attired. In church, at mass, and at all public places, the ladies wore this dress. During the time of the Carnival, they could never go to the theatre or opera without the tabbara e bauta .* which was a long cloak of black or coloured silk, with a black silk cap, and a laced trimming placed round, nearly a yard in length, which fell over the shoulders half way down their figures. Over their faces they wore a mask, and on their heads a man's three-cornered hat, ornamented with feathers and a cockade. But, the moment they reached their boxes, the cap and mask were taken off, until they left the opera ; when they were immediately replaced, until they had passed to their gondolas. This dress, together with the mask, were worn during Carnival time, the feast of the Ascension, and at some other public festivals ; which, alto gether, occupied nearly six months out of the twelve ; and only at these seasons, and in this dress, were they permitted to hold converse with the corps diplomatique resident at Venice. e 2"], [92, "52 VENICE. The gondolas were all painted black, and highly varnished. In the middle of this elegant little vessel is a cushioned bench, for two per sons ; and on each side there is another, suffi cient to hold one person. The tilt, or awning, resembles a hearse, with windows and Venetian blinds. The outer part is covered with black cloth, trimmed with tassels ; the inner with silk ; and a curtain, of the same materials as the out side, serves as a door of entrance. The gon dolas of the foreign ministers, and of other dis tinguished personages, had generally coloured silk curtains, by which they could always be distinguished from those of the Venetians. After the conquest of the Greek Islands, Con stantinople, Cyprus, Candia, and the Morea, by the Republic, from the vast influx of wealth and luxury, and the great increase of population from the Terra Firma, it became necessary, in order to preserve virtuous females from violence, to allot \u2014 in imitation of the ancient Romans \u2014 a certain retired part of the city, for the habita tions of the improperly called Meretrices : and, to prevent those dreadful evils, for which two great cities were once destroyed by fire, the Senators would walk, in the public square of St. Mark, by the side of these necessary evils ; who, at the approach of evening, were required"], [93, "53 VENICE. to exhibit themselves between two lighted can dles, at the windows of their apartments. Under the present government, the frail sisterhood are licensed, and pay a regular tax ; and are per mitted to follow their profession \u2014pro bono pub lico \u2014 wherever they think fit. A considerable number ofthe casinos belong exclusively to the gentlemen. The principal ones are \u2014 II casino dei Nobili, il casino dei Mercanti, il casino degl' Avocati, il casino dei Literati, il casino detto Cento, il casino dei Filosofi, il casino Filo-dramatico, il casino Eu terpiano, il casino dei Vecchij, il casino Fil armonico, il casino dei Consoli, &c. The Free mason's Lodge has been put down, and all who were members thereof have been deprived of their employments, and declared incapable of holding any office under the Austrian govern ment. Many a worthy man has, in this way, been deprived of his situation, without being guilty of any crime. Surely the punishment greatly exceeds the offence ! But, the notions of princes and of individuals differ widely as to these matters. The former adduce the irre sistible argument \u2014 du plus fort: the latter are consoled by the reflection, that there is a Prince of princes, and that the day of retribution, sooner or later, will assuredly arrive. e 3"], [94, "54 CHAPTER VL VENICE. The Venetian Tribunals described The Gentlemen qfthe Bar Former Greatness of Venice Her present fallen condition Necessity qf dividing Italy into separate Go- vernments Appeal to England in behalf qf Genoa and Venice. If, under the Venetian code of legislation, justice, in some instances, happened not to be obtained, it certainly was not the fault either of the judges or of the tribunals ; for every branch thereof was portioned out to different members, who occupied themselves with the civil and criminal departments, the local and external police, &c. All the tribunals, the upper as well as the lower, were exclusively presided over by the nobles, assisted in their jurisdictions by citizens who had been educated for the bar. My reader may form some idea of the multi plicity of the tribunals at Venice, when I tell him that they exceeded those of Paris. First, there was the tribunal appointed to settle all disputes relating to matters of property, and to houses within the city and the neighbouring"], [95, "55 VENICE. islands. Secondly : there was the petty tribunal of the Procurators which decided on disputes relating to property in the Terra Firma, the guardianship of children, marriage contracts, &c. Thirdly : the tribunal which settled all differences subsisting between the inhabitants of Venice and foreigners. Fourthly : the tribunal for contested bills of exchange and promissory notes. Fifthly : the tribunal for deciding upon the value of household furniture, and overcharges. Sixthly : the tribunal whose duty it was to super intend the making and repairing of the streets. Seventhly : the Pioveggi, who revised contracts, and settled the rate of interest to be paid for money borrowed. Eighthly: the tribunal whose duty it was to appoint agents, previously to the seizure and sale of property, and empowering those agents to put in execution the sentences of the other tribunals. Ninthly : the tribunal foi examining into the right of public officers to make seizures ; for putting its seal on property adjudged to be sold or alienated ; legacies and donations by persons dying intestate, &c. Tenthly : there were the Prefetti degli Voti, or tribunal for seeing into the due collection of the taxes, and the expenses of the several tri bunals. The disputes that happened to arise between masters and servants, were confided to E 4"], [96, "56 VENICE. separate officers and magistrates. I have en tered into this detail, merely to justify what I have asserted, with respect to the multiplicity ofthe Venetian tribunals. The Venetian dialect was the only language allowed to be used in all public pleadings, written or oral, whether carried on at the bar or in the senate, as well as in all affairs of state. The solicitors and counsel, as well as every in dividual in their employ, were citizens of Venice, and were held in consideration as men of a certain rank, in all the civilized cities of Europe; so that the profession formed a source of great wealth, to those who distinguished themselves, by devoting their talents to the service of the public. Many of these lawyers, and especially those who united the talent of public pleading to that of giving consultations in private, made immense fortunes, and died possessed of much personal as well as landed property. In strength of argument, in skill, and in beauty of diction, these gentlemen were not inferior to the orators of antient Greece or Rome ; and greatly superior, in point of elo quence, to those of any other country ; more especially in their criminal pleadings, which took place in open court. The counsel for the Republic was always one of the Avogadori,"], [97, "57 VENICE. who opened the case against the person accused, and founded his accusations upon the facts proved. He was replied to by the counsel for the prisoner ; and, whenever his circumstances did not enable him to retain counsel, some one was always found to defend him, from among the College of Advocates, supported by the Re public for that purpose. It was usual to produce every thing relating to the circumstances ofthe trial in court \u2014 such as pistols, swords, and weapons of every descrip tion ; and both the accuser and accused were accompanied to the court by their relatives and friends : a custom which also prevailed, in similar cases, in the antient tribunals of Greece and Rome. If this popular mode of adjudging criminal matters has been abolished in many of the northern nations, it has principally arisen from the preponderance of ecclesiastical influence ; seeing that canonical institutions, that is to say, those that were devised by the Popes for the Inquisition, were more familiar to the people, than any other legal mode of proceeding by the laity. Two principal events deprived the Venetians of the vast commercial advantages, which, for centuries, they exclusively enjoyed, until they"], [98, "58 VENICE. became divided with other trading nations : first, the discovery ofthe Cape of Good Hope ; and, secondly, the interdiction ofthe nobles, by the senate, from engaging in mercantile con cerns. Until then, Venice possessed the trade of the Indies by Alexandria and the Red Sea, and was the entrepot of all Europe and Asia. Their commercial contemporaries were the Pisanese and the Genoese; who supplied the world with all those articles of merchandize which have since been shared between England, Holland, France, and other nations. The com merce which they carried on was the more honourable, since it was conducted by the first nobles of the state, who were governed by the same generous and noble spirit that actuated the Republic, in their wars, their conquests, and their treaties. \" Venezia la Ricca,\" the once beautiful, opu lent, and unrivalled Queen of the Sea, has, alas ! long since been politically blotted, as a capital, out ofthe map of Europe, having been sacrificed to Austrian cupidity, by the perfidious policy of Buonaparte. That single act \u2014 that one atrocious deed \u2014 independently of the murder ofthe Duke D'Enghien, and of so many other crimes of the same stamp \u2014 was alone sufficient to have called down upon his head that Divine"], [99, "59 VENICE. vengeance, which never fails to overtake the miscreant who dares to contemn His sacred com mands. And, what crime, I ask, can be more truly sacrilegious, than the treacherously betray ing an unoffending, a confiding, and an unsus pecting people to bondage under a foreign yoke? The Venetian states, with Istria, Dalmatia, and the Milanese, under the mock title of a separate kingdom, form the gigantic boundaries of Austrian direct preponderancy ; indepen dently of the influence which she indirectly assumes over the entire of Italy. There is not, in fact, a foot of land from Savoy, including Sardinia and Sicily, throughout this, the finest, the richest, the most populous and most civi lized part of Europe, over which the Austrian does not possess either an immediate or a family interest \u2014 to the incalculable prejudice of the general commerce of the rest of Europe, now struggling for emancipation, and endeavouring to establish a just equalization. To preserve such an equilibrium has, since the destruction of the Roman empire, been ever the policy of Europe ; and the general safety requires, that Italy should be divided into twelve small states and governments. Of these separate governments, Venice and Genoa were"], [100, "60 VENICE. ever the most happy, and the most flourishing. And yet, there are mortals to be found, who have the effrontery to hold forth in praise of the new system of spoliation and aggrandize ment ! I, nevertheless, venture fearlessly to assert \u2014 and the assertion is the result of a many years' intercourse, in Italy, with men of sound judgment and great sagacity \u2014 that these short sighted politicians will never behold the restora tion of general tranquillity in Europe, unless Italy \u2014 if not united into a kingdom, like France, Spain, England, Portugal, and other nations \u2014 be again divided into separate governments, as it was before the breaking out of the French revolution. I challenge the Sovereigns of Europe to shew any sufficient cause why nations, like individuals in a court of justice, should not be permitted to enforce the validity of their claim to indepen dence. Can you, England, who so sensibly feel the blessings of that envied constitution, which secures to you your native rights, and the enjoyment of which rights you are gene rously endeavouring to extend even to the savage \u2014 can you, I ask, continue any longer insensible to the degraded situation, the intole rable sufferings, of the people of Genoa and Venice ? If you did not betray them by the"], [101, "61 VENICE. false protestations of your commissioners, you at least flattered them with the hopes, that they should be restored to their lost liberty and in dependence. At any rate, your respectable military commanders not only declared that they were authorized to guarantee those in valuable blessings, but went so far as to pro mise the people, that they should be protected by the British, in the possession of their antient, or of any other form of government, which they might consider most conducive to their own happiness. Mieux tard qaejamais ! It is not yet too late. And, for the honour of my beloved England, I cannot help indulging a hope that, compromised as she thus is, in the eyes of all Europe, in the natural degradation that must ensue, from the continuance of the present system, she will no longer continue quiescent. Let me also hope, as I before took occasion to observe, that our philanthropists will not confine themselves to the emancipation of the Blacks, but that they will lend their ready assistance in redeeming the five-and-twenty millions of White Christian slaves \u2014 Greeks and Italians \u2014 now groaning beneath the yoke of foreign oppression. Before I quit this part of my subject, allow me to make one observation. Shakespeare has told us, that \" sweet are the uses of adversity ;\""], [102, "62 VENICE. and I believe it to be strictly true, that the school of affliction proves a school of wisdom, to all classes of human beings \u2014 princes and crowned heads excepted ! For, it is a melan- choly fact, that, notwithstanding the long exile of the Sovereigns of Italy, in islands compara- tively rude and uncultivated, and notwithstand- ing their almost miraculous return to their own beautiful dominions, they have brought back with them the same prejudices, the same ar bitrary notions, and the same religious bigotry, which formerly distinguished all their actions, and to which may alone be attributed the anni hilation of their authority, arid the present restless condition of their unhappy subjects.

The low, niggardly, base, and parsimonious conduct of the Austrian authorities in Italy, is"], [103, "63 VENICE. as disgraceful as it is incredible ; as disgusting as it is injurious to their own interests. Whither is fled the noble spirit of Maria Theresa, of Joseph the Second, and of their truly great minded and princely minister, Kaunitz ? It is an easy matter to censure : I will, therefore, adduce facts, in proof of the truth of my assertion. At the period when the mad-brained Murat invaded the north of Italy, the Marquis Pietro Solari, on his return from Rome with despatches for the Austrian Government, was waylaid by that sanguinary adventurer, and wantonly mur dered between Ferrara and Rovigo, within a stone's throw of his brother Jerome's estate, merely to obtain possession of his despatches. The Marquis had been three-and-forty years in the service. Two of his brothers had fallen gloriously in the field of battle, under Joseph the Second and Leopold ; and many other members of this antient and noble house \u2014 which dates its origin from the great families of Mala Testa, hundreds of years before Counts of Hopsburg, from whom the present imperial family descends, were heard of \u2014 for the space of four centuries had shewn their attachment to the House of Austria ; and, for their signal achievements were raised, by Joseph the First, to the rank of his Austrian and German nobility,"], [104, "64 VENICE. and permitted to surmount their own arms with the imperial coronet. Yet, notwithstanding all these strong claims, such was the unparalleled avarice of the Austrian Government, and such its neglect of this loyal and meritorious family, that the perpetrators of this foul murder have never been brought to justice ; although there is every reason to believe, that the postilion was accessary to the sanguinary deed. The relatives of the noble victim, finding that no steps had been taken by the Government to bring the perpetrators of the murder to justice, applied personally to Vani, the head of the police at Venice ; who gave them the following answer: \u2014 \"Gentlemen, the government will not reward the Sbirri for the apprehension of assassins ; and I myself am so wretchedly paid, that I cannot afford to do it at my own expense. Under the former government, if I happened to have occasion for twenty or thirty extra hands for an affair of importance, I was not only paid for it, but thanked for my zeal and activity ; whereas, the present Government would not only refuse to defray the expenses, but dismiss me for having done my duty. Had this happened under our lost Republic, the perpetrators would have been brought to justice, and the family of the unfortunate nobleman"], [105, "65 VENICE would have been rewarded for his long services, and their irreparable loss. But\u2014 tempora mu tantur!\" Yes ! the times are indeed changed. The conduct of the Venetian Republic was in truth paternal, magnanimous, and generous towards all its subjects \u2014especially towards those engaged in its service, and towards its poor. As I have had occasion to introduce the name of Murat, I will here state, that I have been credibly informed, by one of his nearest rela tions, that he never would have entertained the project of invading the north of Italy, or of making war against Austria, if he had not received the strongest assurance,-;, that, the moment he took the field, he would have the assistance of Great Britain. It is, however, most probable, that his real motive, in making this move towards the north, proceeded solely from a desire of exciting the alarms of Austria for the safety of her own possessions in Italy, and thereby disabling her from assisting the Bourbons, in preventing Napoleon from recover ing the diadem of France. The much talked-of Venetian Bernabotti, who take their name from having once lived, from motives of frugality, in a remote quarter of the city, called San Barnaba, are the descen- vol. i. f"], [106, "66 VENICE. dants of some of the first inhabitants of the Adriatic islands. All of them are ancient pa tricians, who, from misfortunes and a train of unforeseen events, have been reduced to the lowest pitch of indigence. To prevent, how ever, their being driven to the dire necessity of begging in the public streets, .or of being em ployed in menial occupations, which might re flect disgrace on the descendants of the founders of its liberty and independence, the Republic kindly thought fit to make ample provision, in their various religious and lay institutions, for their reception and decent support. The males, whose inclinations might not dispose them to follow a religious avocation, the moment they attained the age of five-and-twenty, were ap pointed to the Quaranta. But, the claim to this provision for the Bernabotti, like that for the knights of Malta, depended on purity of blood. If that blood chanced to be contami nated by an unfortunate crossing of breed, the odds ran hard against their being entitled thereto. As their very subsistence, therefore, was made to depend on legitimacy, they rarely disgraced their birth by a plebeian marriage ; since, the provision was only bestowed on those, whose nativity and matrimonial unions were inscribed in the Golden Book, or register of nobility."], [107, "67 VENICE. There were, however, several liberal pro fessions, which intitled their followers to the rank of nobility. For instance : if the daughter of a professional man married a patrician, their offspring were inserted in the Libro d'Oro. If a patrician happened to unite himself to a ple beian, the females of that marriage, when wedded to a patrician, were allowed to take the rank of their husbands. The males were employed as secretaries, or as residents of the second order, at the different courts. This was the case with Alviso Quirini, brother to the well-known and beautiful Marina Benzoni; their father having been a patrician, and their mother a butcher's daughter. I am not here speaking of the Alviso Quirini, who was the last ambas sador extraordinary to the French Directory ; he, as well as his lady, being both pure patri cians. This was the Alviso Quirini, who had the honour to be appointed, by the Austrian Govern ment at Venice, to attend on her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales, the late Queen of Eng land, during her residence in that city; and whose wife presented all the Venetian ladies, whom her Royal Highness condescended either to see, or be seen by. The Government of Venice was in theory republican. Yet no citizen, however opulent, f 2"], [108, "68 VENICE. could aspire to aristocratical prerogatives, unless he could prove, de facto, that neither himself nor his ancestors had been engaged in commer cial transactions for the space of two centuries. And, so jealous were they of their ancient pri vileges, that they only issued letters patent for aggregating the nobility of the Terra Firma to their own aristocracy in times of necessity, and when they had occasion to raise large sums of money, for carrying on their wars against the Turks, and other barbarous nations. If the Republics of Venice and of Malta still existed, Christianity wrould not now have to mourn over the thousands of its followers, who have been cruelly massacred by those savage infidels ! The number of those who were aggregated * from the Terra Firma to the Venetian nobility was very limited. They were even ballotted for by the Senate. Many have been rejected, and have had their money returned to them. For the nobility of the Terra Firma were obliged to * Every family, or individual, so called up, was obliged, as a guarantee for the due maintenance of the new dignity, to lodge a hundred thousand ducats in the Bank of Venice. This sum was lost to the family of the Marchioness of Solari, seeing that there had been no fresh aggregation from the Terra Ferma between the time of the money being lodged and the downfall of the Republic."], [109, "69 VENICE. undergo the same formalities as those of Venice ; and, even when aggregated, it required a cen tury or two, entirely to eradicate the prejudices existing between them and the old nobility. For instance, they could not belong to the Savio Consiglio di Dieci, or Council of Ten ; they could not be of the Inquisitori di Stata ; nor Doge ; nor ambassadors extraordinary ; nor Podesta of Venice, &c. Under the old Venetian Republic, the tribu nals were composed of one hundred and twenty members, called the Quarantia ; out of whom, forty were chosen by ballot, to preside, both as judges and jurors, in all civil matters. They were divided as follows: 1. La Quarantia civil vecchia ; 2. La Quarantia civil nuova ; 3. La Quarantia della Terra Ferma. The members were called Quaranta, because they belonged to the Quarantia. Every patri cian was eligible to the situation, as soon as he had attained the age of five-and-twenty. They much resembled an English jury ; only they held the office for life. They must have been men who had been regularly educated for the bar. They were not under the necessity of coming to an unanimous verdict, as is the case in British courts of justice ; but decided by a majority of votes, entirely from the evidence"], [110, "70 VENICE. which had come out before them, while sitting in the character of judges. If, by chance, it came to be known, that any member of the Quarantia had given a legal opinion upon the case, previously to its coming before him in his judicial capacity, he was declared incapable of sitting upon that trial, and his place was filled by another. As the members of the Quarantia were gene rally either men of small fortunes, or belonging to the order called Bernabotti, they each re ceived an annual salary, out of the public purse, of a hundred and twenty golden ducats, called in the Venetian dialect zecchini, to distinguish them from the ducato, of which there are two sorts ; one of silver, of the value of four French francs; the other a nominal money, like our pound sterling, called ducato di Banco, worth something less than three francs. The Venetian Republic, during its beneficent and truly paternal sway, bestowed a pension on all the children of the Bernabotti, from their cradle upwards. That which, in other countries, is too often considered a misfortune, was, to the above-mentioned class, a source of comfort and of emolument. They therefore cheerfully obeyed, as early as nature would permit, the sacred injunction \u2014 \"Increase and multiply!\""], [111, "71 VENICE. When Buonaparte flagitiously overturned the antient Venetian power, many of these unfortu nate Bernabotti were deprived of the means of procuring a subsistence ; and, if some of their own countrymen had not generously stepped forward to relieve their immediate wants, they must inevitably have perished ; for their new masters quitted them, without making any other provision for them than two livres a day. This scanty pittance has, however, been deemed too large by their present rulers ; for, all those who have praise-worthily endeavoured to add to this wretched allowance by their own industry, and to gain a trifle by engaging themselves as clerks in mercantile houses, have actually been deprived of it, by a decree of his gracious Imperial Majesty, declaring all persons incapable of enjoying the luxury of this enormous pension, provided they happen to have any other means of procuring a subsistence for themselves and families. As it is quite impossible to live on this pittance, many have actually chosen to trust to the chance of getting employment, and have preferred to renounce their claim altogether, rather than exclude themselves, by accepting it, from every prospect of bettering their deplorable condition."], [112, "72 CHAPTER VIII.

When I have reflected on the treatment which Venice has met with at the hands of her new master, I have often wondered within myself, what his conduct towards her would have been, if, instead of being a \" bright jewel,\" and a \" most valuable gem,\" that royal personage had happened to consider her mere French paste ! This bombastic language wrought like a charm on the ears of the two and-thirtv pro-"], [113, "73 VENICE. prietors of the General Post, who had been robbed of their property, and deprived of the exercise of their functions, by the Corsican freebooter. Accordingly, the Company of Vene tian Couriers, as they are called, went up in a body, and presented to his Imperial Majesty a memorial, praying for the restitution of their property ; and begging to be either replaced in the exercise of their dearly-purchasedimmunities, or to be paid the sum which, centuries before, the Republic had resolved on granting them, if it should ever come to the determination of making the post-office a public concern. To which memorial, the Emperor most feelingly replied, that \"it was but fair and just that the Company should be indemnified, since the Government were then reaping the benefit of the concern ; but, in consequence of the expen sive wars which Austria had, for so many years, been compelled to carry on, the public treasury was at that time too much exhausted, to admit of any additional burthens ; however, if the Venetian States were willing to submit to the levying of a tax for that purpose, the produce should be duly applied to the liquidation of their claim.\" ,x This proposition was accordingly made to the States, and was most patriotically acquiesced in;"], [114, "74 VENICE. but, when the Austrians were driven from those States by the French, they carried away with them the produce of the tax so levied, without paying the company a single ducat ; and the debt remains unliquidated to the present hour, although many of those unfortunate couriers have had their lands and household goods seized on for a two months' arrear of the taxes. All the facts of this aggravating case have now stood on the Austrian official records for more than five-and-twenty years : yet, neither prin cipal nor interest has to this day been paid to the distressed sufferers ! On the dissolution of the ancient Venetian Government, the magnificent palace of Andrea Cornaro became a receptacle for the effects of many of the nobles, who, on retiring from the capital, were not able to dispose of them. In this situation they remained, until the Austrian Government purchased the above-mentioned palace for public offices. Scarcely, however, had it been taken possession of, when, in conse quence of the introduction of a number of German stoves, the palace caught fire, and the property of the unfortunate nobles, which had been therein deposited for nearly fifteen years, was totally destroyed. Marshal Chatlaire, who was at that time the"], [115, "75 VENICE. military commander at Venice, and who had lived a great deal with the Turks, though a Frenchman by birth, conducted himself, on this distressing occasion, in a manner worthy of an infidel. In this instance, at least, the old English proverb, \" Tell me your company, and I'll tell you what sort of a man you are,\" was com pletely verified ; for he comported himself more like a barbarian than a Christian. Instead of calling out the firemen of the Arsenale \u2014 an active class of men, usually employed on such occasions \u2014 he directed five hundred of his horde of Croats to enter the palace ; who either savagely destroyed, or carried off with them, whatever the flames \u2014 more merciful than them selves \u2014 had spared. They demolished immense pier glasses of great value ; carrying off the fragments to their barracks, and making them serve in the place of razors to shave themselves with. They also took away numerous articles of expensive furniture belonging to the noble owner of the palace, and to others. This truly distressing circumstance is gene rally supposed to have been occasioned by the maliciously over-heating of the stoves, which the Austrians introduce wherever they go, to the total destruction of some of the finest paint ings and buildings in Venice ; since they are"], [116, "76 VENICE. not at all calculated either for the edifices or the climate of Italy. The effect produced by this fire on the minds of the people was so unfavourable to the Aus trians, that it was thought advisable to dispatch to Vienna a detailed account of the misfortune which had befallen this new public office. His Imperial Majesty, ever tremblingly alive to the welfare of his liege subjects, graciously directed a decree to be issued and sent round to the magistrates of Venice, enjoining them to procure estimates, drawn up on stamped paper, of the amount of the loss sustained by every indi vidual, and to transmit them forthwith to the Government at Vienna. This step quieted the unfortunate sufferers for a time. However, after a lapse of nearly a twelvemonth, they received from the Camera Aulica, the very consolatory answer \u2014 that \" no individual had a right to deposit property in any of the public offices ;\" though the Austrian Government, when it sent that answer, was well aware, that the property destroyed had been lodged in the palace fifteen years before it was purchased for a public office ! Hope, delusive meteor ! what myriads hast thou misled and bewildered, by thy smiles and fascinating prospects ! What loads of treasure"], [117, "77 VENICE. hast thou juggled out of the pockets of the rightful owners, and transferred to the bottom less coffers of the Austrian Exchequer ! leaving the cajoled expectants to exclaim with Has tings \u2014 O momentary grace of mortal men, Which we more hunt for than the grace of God ! Who builds his hope in air of your fair looks, Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast ; Ready, with every nod, to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep.\" Numerous are the decrees, of the above gra cious description, which have been issued by the Austrian Government, to quiet the unwary Venetians, by the expectation of redress for their grievances, and indemnification for their losses. This trick is resorted to, from motives of the most far-fetched guile, in order to extract the last ducat from the pockets of these miserable victims to every species of human disaster. For, be it known to my readers, that, once a week, his \" paternal\" and Imperial Majesty receives at Vienna the humblest of his German subjects. They must, however, as a preparatory and indis pensable step, be all of them furnished with a memorial, drawn up on stamped paper ; for, without a memorial so drawn up, not a Jack of them can be admitted into the royal presence!"], [118, "78 VENICE. But, alas for the poor Venetians, whose terri tory his Imperial Majesty designates as the \" brightest jewel \" and the \" most valuable gem\" of his crown, they are not permitted to feast their longing eyes on the august counte nance, unless when the Emperor graciously con descends to pay a visit to the city of desolation ! Being generally interdicted from journeying to Vienna, they have no other mode of making known their grievances, but through the me dium of stamped-paper memorials. No fewer than twelve thousand of these memorials, on subjects deeply affecting their well-being, have been returned to them, accompanied with a direct negative to their pressing solici tations. Nay, to such a pitch is this system carried, that it is now become quite a common thing at Venice, when it is rumoured that any one, not in the secret, is about to send off a petition to Vienna, appealing against some act of injustice, to exclaim \u2014 \" If you happen to have any money which you are desirous of flinging away, risk it in the lottery ; for there, at least, you have one chance out of a thousand in your favour : but, if you send a memorial to Vienna, no benefit can possibly arise out of it\u2014 except to tlie Austrian treasury !\""], [119, "79 VENICE. And, that this covert sort of impost is a highly lucrative one, there can, I believe, be very little doubt ; since his Imperial Majesty, once or twice in the space of every month, gives an audience, which lasts for six or eight hours, to persons of all ranks and descriptions, for the sole purpose of receiving these memorials. And, as they are generally returned, by the post, to the different petitioners, a fresh source of revenue presents itself to Austrian cupidity ! But, why should I complain of all this ? Are not the Venetians Italians? And, if the Germans ge nerously condescend to leave them their eyes to weep with, would it not be ingratitude, \" more hideous than the sea-monster,\" to complain ? Under the Venetian Government, and even under the yoke of Buonaparte, all persons known to be in slender circumstances were exempted, when they happened to have occasion to go to law, from the payment of certain stamp and register duties ; and not unfrequently from the expence of counsel, and the charges for briefs and affidavits. The simplicity, too, of the law proceedings formerly, in comparison with those at present adopted, was, in the pro portion of one to a hundred, more beneficial, both to plaintiff and defendant, than the com plicated and confused forms introduced by the"], [120, "80 VENICE. Austrians. If properly followed up, a lawsuit, in the space of six weeks, might be carried through all its stages, up to its termination. The Venetian laws were also distinguished for their clearness and simplicity. Neither has the eloquence of their public pleaders been exceeded by the orators of any other country whatever. Indeed, for the space of centuries, the excellence of the laws of Venice, and the fairness with which those laws were adminis tered, occasioned the tribunals of that city to be held in such esteem throughout Italy, that per sons from all parts were accustomed to send their differences to be decided by the Courts of Venice, in preference to those existing in any other parts ofthe kingdom. But, all these great and glorious deeds of the olden time have vanished \u2014 never more to return ! At Venice, the poor have now no protector to look up to, save Heaven ! Under the iron gripe of Austria, the rising genius of her citizens is nipped in the bud. Men of talents are forbidden to exercise those talents, in the church, or at the bar; \u2014 at least, within the Venetian territories. This barbarous policy operates most destruc tively ; for it not only checks the progress of the arts and sciences, but arrests the march of"], [121, "81 VENICE. civilization. It also strikes at the very root and life-spring of\" la bella litteratura Italiana.\" The Venetians, therefore, as they value their own comfort, should imitate the conduct of the ancient Greeks ; who, after the tyrant Sylla had overturned the tribunals at Athens, instituted aca demies, where the people were taught the art of forgetting what they had once acquired. Even the works of the great Metastasio \u2014 who wrote the chief part of his operas at Vienna, at the express command of her Imperial Majesty the Empress Maria Theresa, for the entertainment and instruction of her daughters, the Arch duchesses, and which works the murdered Marie- Antoinette was so passionately fond of, that she had committed their principal beauties to memory \u2014 even these works, I say, are now amongst the list of libri prohibiti, in the Aus trian dominions !

After the best consideration I have been able to give to the treatment which the people of Italy generally, and the Venetians in par ticular, have experienced at the hands of their task-masters, I cannot help saying, and I do not use the expression irreverently, that the latter, during a space of nearly two thousand years, are the only people who have followed the example of the Saviour of the world \u2014 who, when he received the sacrilegious slap, instead of resenting the foul insult, turned the other cheek to receive a repetition ofthe outrage. To nothing else can I compare the humiliating condition to which the noblest portion of God's creatures are now reduced ! We are told, that men are"], [123, "83 VENICE. never taught wisdom so effectually as in the school of adversity. I believe the maxim to be a just one. It should however be borne in mind by their rulers, that the Venetians are men ; and that, though they may hitherto have pa tiently submitted to the yoke of the oppressor, it does not necessarily follow, that they will for ever consent to remain in their present prostrate condition. Every individual possessing a grain of proper feeling, is naturally actuated by the laudable desire of being useful to his country ; and he expects to receive from his sovereign the re ward of his exertions, instead of seeing that re ward bestowed on a foreigner ; more especially when that individual feels, that he is not only in every respect the equal of the intruder, but greatly his superior, both in ability and in local information. No Venetian, however, is permitted to serve under the Austrian government, but as un'Alun no, and without pay. The Germans, never theless, are employed in all the departments of the state, both at Venice and in the Terra Firma, and receive regular salaries ; although many of them, from their entire ignorance of the Italian language, are incapable of perform ing their duty towards either their sovereign or the public. c 2"], [124, "84 YEN I C E. And, has a government thus unmindful ofthe sacred obligations which it owes to all its sub jects, any right to expect from those subjects love and attachment in return ? The Venetians, at present, are very little better than mere slaves attached to .the soil. No one is allowed to be absent from his watery element on a visit to the Terra Firma, without first presenting himself before the police, and there making a full confession of \" parentage and education, life, character and behaviour,\" prior to his ob taining a passport. Let the business be ever so urgent, and the journey be merely to Fusina or Mestre \u2014 the former town being three, and the latter five miles from the capital \u2014 a delay of some days intervenes before the trifling request is complied with ; and even then it is only granted upon the responsibility of two respect able housekeepers, for the good conduct and safe return of the applicant. Should the individual soliciting the passport happen to be a person of rank, the request must, in that case, be made to the Secretary of State at Vienna, whose more pressing engagements will probably prevent his sending an answer for five or six months ; and, even then, it is not unfrequently in the negative. If in the affir mative, a deposit must be made, at the rate of a"], [125, "85 VENICE. zecchino per month, for the time of being absent, and a couple of ducats must in addition be paid for the passport. It has been given out in this country, that his Imperial Majesty, from his \" paternal \" anxiety for the preservation of the magnificent monuments of art with which the city of Venice abounds, has interdicted the further demolition of those beautiful palaces, which can only be compared to a forest of rich marble, rising out of the briny ocean, by some such supernatural operation, as that which is narrated to have divided Sicily from Calabria, or formed the Pharos at Messina. It is scarcely possible for a traveller to give a faithful description of a city, which differs from every known city, not only in Europe, but in the other quarters of the globe. The sight of the immense blocks of beautiful marble, which present themselves between the foundation piles, and the palaces reared upon them, has such an astounding effect upon the beholder, as almost to leave him in doubt whether marble, as well as the piscatory tribe, be not the native production of the watery element : for it appears impossible, that the vessels used in na vigation at that remote period, should have been of sufficient dimensions to have conveyed those"], [126, "86 VENICE. massy blocks from Greece to their present station ; or that, when they had reached Venice, they could have been landed uninjured out of those vessels, but by the aid of the most skilful and most perfect machinery. The sums ex pended upon the hidden foundations of these noble palaces, are calculated to have greatly exceeded the cost of the visible parts of these splendid edifices. His Imperial Majesty is a native of classical Florence, and may therefore naturally be presumed to be a patron of the fine arts. In consequence of the present system of govern ment at Venice, many of the most distinguished patrician families having, from cruel necessity, been obliged to pull down a portion of these monuments of their former grandeur, to pro cure to themselves the means of a miserable subsistence in the country, which of course destroyed the uniformity of the city ; to prevent a repetition of the practice, a decree was issued from Vienna, forbidding the proprietors to deface or mulitate any of the palaces. But, in the teeth of its own decree, this most consistent as well as most \" paternal \" government, has not hesitated \u2014 oh, dire digrace ! oh, unheard of sacrilege ! \u2014 to confiscate them for arrears of taxes, and to dispose of them to Jews, who"], [127, "87 VENICE. convert the classical remains into storehouses, after taking down the ornaments and selling the materials. So that the barbarous custom which the decree was intended to prevent, still con tinues unabated ; for no one, now-a-days, would think of purchasing a Venetian palace, upon any other than the above Israelitish principle, \u2014 a practice this, which adds daily to the misery of this already too-much oppressed and worn-down people : for, under the hammer of the govern ment auctioneer, a splendid palace is often knocked down for a mere song. That many of the noble patrician families are reduced to the last stage of misery, is but too notorious. In proof of the distressing fact, I will only adduce the sudden death of poor Zorzi, the patrician, and husband of Marcellina Gondollmer, who was found dead near the Piazza di San Marco, from actual want of food and raiment ! The above-mentioned lady ac companied Mr. Rose, in his travels through Italy, and came with him to this country. She has since returned, with her son, to her native land, where she is living comfortably upon a pension, which has been liberally settled upon her by our enlightened countryman. The public taxes at Venice, as I have already observed, are collected, under the present au-"], [128, "88 VENICE. thorities, every two months : for the payment of which, a printed government receipt is given. Should, however, the tax-gatherer abscond, which is no uncommon case, the individual, notwithstanding his receipt, is compelled to pay them over again. Commerce, navigation, agriculture, as well as all the useful arts and sciences, are now mere non-entities at Venice. The exorbitant excise and customs duties, together with other vexa tions, have deterred all merchant vessels from trading to that port, since it has been under the \" paternal \" government of Austria. I must, however, except a few boats bringing salt-fish, red herrings, and dried sprats. Jf, therefore, the poor forlorn Venetians stand in need of a barrel of coffee, or a hogshead of sugar, they must patiently wait, until they can procure it from Trieste, at second or third hand. Though it is not uncommon for a vessel to reach Venice from the last-mentioned port, in the short space of eight hours ; yet, from the numerous obstacles thrown in the way by the custom-house officers, it is at least as many days before it can be unloaded. The com mercial regulations adopted by Austria have occasioned a decrease in the import and export"], [129, "89 VENICE. trade of Venice, to the extent of thirty thousand florins per month. The commercial buildings and warehouses are actually become mere watch-boxes, and barracks for the men, who were once busily employed as porters, to load and unload the merchandize ; but who are now chiefly occupied in guarding the bales for transit, or in prevent ing the hungry rats from gnawing the cordage and packing. Such is the present degraded condition of the spot which, until the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, was considered the first commercial city of the world ! So celebrated was once the Arsenal of Venice, that it was looked up to as a model for all the dock-yards and other naval establishments throughout Europe. Four-and-twenty ships of war were constantly kept in a state of readiness, either for the use of the republic, or the service of its allies. Thus were thousands upon thou sands of skilful and industrious artificers, of every description connected with the maritime department, kept in constant employ, within the small circle of three miles. Trees in their unhewn shape, rough from the forests, entered the arsenal, and sailed out of it vessels com pletely equipped for service, and wanting nothing"], [130, "90 VENICE. but their warlike stores, such as cannon, balls, and powder ; which were conveyed to them in small boats, to the mouth of the sea, called il Lido, at the distance of about three miles from Venice ; since no vessel drawing more than seven feet water can approach nearer to the city. Over the gateway of the arsenal still stands the winged lion of St. Mark, guarded on either side by colossal lions, taken from the Pir\u00e6us at Athens. Now, alas, this monument of Venetian skill, and industry, and enterprize, is little more than a receptacle for old lumber, and the choppings up of the logs and staves of decayed vessels for fuel ! To give my reader a correct notion of the amazing sapience of the Austrians in matters appertaining to commerce, I need only state, that on their first taking possession of this once flourishing port, the cockets which they calcu lated would serve them for six months were not more than sufficient for the demand often days \u2014 a circumstance which occasioned a total stagna tion of trade, until a further supply could be procured from that sanctum sanctorum the Aulic Chamber at Vienna ; as they are not suffered to be printed at Venice, For a Venetian to go to Vienna to demand redress for any injury he may have sustained,"], [131, "VENICE. 91 would be almost as difficult as it would be for a man to land in any part of Europe, after a voyage to Turkey, without previously perform ing quarantine. These \" bright jewels,\" these \" valuable gems\" of Venetian subjects, as their \" paternal\" sovereign styles them, are preserved as carefully as diamonds in cotton. They are shut out from the capital of Austria ; and the local governors have especial orders not to grant them passports for that purpose. Like crown jewels, they are only to be seen on extraordinary occasions. But then, their native lustre, how ever they may have been pent up in darkness, is found to outvie whatever is placed in compe tition with them ; nor can even the iron hand of despotism tarnish their intrinsic brilliancy. In the ears of those who do not intend a remedy, the vibration of the complaints of the injured must ever be discordant and unwelcome. The more remote, therefore, the sufferers are from the authors of their grievances, the less will \" the worm of conscience begnaw their souls ;\" for, assuredly, the delicate nerves of ex- alted personages ought not to be deprived of their accustomed tension, on account of the miseries of a few thousand poverty-struck and half-starved human beings! The Venetians are not even permitted to"], [132, "92 VENICE. reprint the newspaper published at Vienna, until it has been carefully examined by the officers of the police ; who strike out whatever they may think fit, before they suffer it to be translated into the Italian language. Graziosi, the editor and proprietor of a journal, for not having con- formed to this most degrading regulation, was arrested by the police, and threatened with fine, imprisonment, and the total suppression of his paper. In his defence he alleged, that \" he had done nothing more than give a verbatim transla- tion of the contents of the German journal, written under the immediate inspection of M. Pilato, the political secretary of Prince Metter- nich ; and that he could not imagine that mat- ters of a treasonable nature would find their way into a publication issuing from such a quarter.\" Notwithstanding which, he was severely repri- manded, and told, that \" there was a wide differ- ence between what ought to be allowed to the inhabitants of the capital of the empire, and what ought to be allowed to the natives of a conquered city of a petty province.\" The tame submission of the present race of Venetians, proves them to be subjects worthy of such a government. The same conduct is to this day rigorously observed. Not a newspaper do the police suffer to make its appearance, until they"], [133, "VENICE. 93 have cut out and garbled whatever they may be anxious to keep from the eyes of the enslaved population ! CHAPTER X. VENICE. Overthrow qfthe Monastic Institutions at Venice Reduced Condition qf their former Inmates Low State qfthe Ecclesiastical Establishments Religion qfthe Venetians A Visit to the Greek Church And to the Armenian The Inquisition. Throughout the Venetian territories, as well as in every other part of Italy, the monks and nuns have fallen into the toils of the revolution. Not that I regret the overthrow of the monastic institutions ; though I cannot but deprecate the treatment which some of the noble as well as most worthy members of these and of other peaceable establishments have met with. These unfortunate beings, of both sexes, were exclusively natives of the Venetian territories. They were most exemplary in the performance of their moral and religious duties, and distin guished for their charity towards the poor of"], [134, "94 VENICE. their dependencies. If conduct so praiseworthy can weigh aught in their favour with the unpre judiced and the benevolent, I trust it will be my excuse for exposing to the world the harsh treatment which they have experienced under the rule of Austria. The greater part of them were the relatives of patrician families, who had been reduced to ruin by the overthrow of the Republic. They had been too delicately brought up to betake themselves to menial occupations ; and many of them were too old to be made serviceable. Consequently, when they were driven from their convents, if there had not been some small allowance for their daily support, they must, in this, the eighteenth century of Christian civilization, have inevitably perished from hunger. Oh! if our much-vaunted Philanthropic so cieties, and our Bible societies, and our Men dicity societies, and our societies for the Sup pression of Vice, and the Abolition of Sla very, had but condescended to bestow an atom of their benevolence on these devoted victims of revolutionary principles, surely it would have been as honourable, and to the full as pleasing in the sight of God, as it was to assail the House of Commons with clamours for the Abolition of the Black Slave Trade !"], [135, "95 VENICE. In all governments there must exist a hierarch. Why, then, should the Lady Abbess, or il padre Abate, not be suffered to exercise the same prerogative over the menial servant of a convent, which the field-marshal exercises over the private soldier, or the bishop over the curate, and which, in fact, is exercised in every country, and distinguishes the dependant from the su perior ? At Venice, however, the Lady Abbess and the kitchen-maid, the house-porter and the head of the convent, had alike the same scanty pension of a couple of Venetian livres ; that is to say, about tenpence English money per day, allowed them to subsist upon ; as if these unfortunate, and worn down, and decrepid crea tures had no longer any claim on the common feelings of humanity ! And, even this miserable sum, out of which they are to find themselves in food, and in clothes, and in habitation, is not paid to them, until six months after it becomes due : by which delay, the government not only saves something in the way of interest, but speculates on the chance of some ofthe poor creatures dying in the interim. Nor are the tradespeople willing to give them the least credit ; well knowing that the govern ment, in case they should die within the six"], [136, "96 V E N 1 C E. months, would refuse to pay their debts, though those debts might have been contracted for the very necessaries of life. So that these miserable beings would literally be reduced to a state of starvation, were it not for the benevolence of a few of their old dependents and some charitable shop-keepers, wbo formerly served their con vents, and who, from gratitude for past kind nesses, continue to supply them on trust for the articles they may stand in need of. In all catholic countries, when any extraordi nary national calamity befalls the people, the government generally give directions to the ecclesiastical authorities to order public prayers to be offered up to the Supreme Being, beseech ing him to avert the impending danger. These religious ceremonies are performed with all that pomp and decorum, which is customary in that religion, when invoking the Almighty. The churches are brilliantly lighted up ; and although, on these occasions, they are crowded to excess, there rarely happens the least dis order. Although their ecclesiastics, under the Vene tian Republic, possessed no absolute authority, as is the case in other states, yet they used to provide the means necessary on these solemn occasions ; well knowing the liberal system of"], [137, "97 VENICE. the government, in all matters of public utility, and especially in matters appertaining to religion ; and that it never took advantage of those who confided in its generosity. But, at present, this class, like the former inhabitants of the convents, are so shabbily rewarded for their services, that they are no longer in a con dition to supply the church, even for its common necessaries, much less for extraordinary occa sions. The above ceremony usually commenced with the exhibition of the crucifix, surrounded by twenty-four wax torches. Under the plea of preserving good order, this ceremony, as well as the lighting up of the church, is not now suffered, without first sending to Vienna for permission. But, religious zeal can stomach no delay ; and, to prevent the consequences likely to ensue from disappointment, the clergy of the Basilica of San Marco, the first cathedral in Christendom, have actually been under the necessity of parading the streets, going from house to house, and begging the shopkeepers of the Merceria, and all piously disposed per sons, to contribute towards the expense of calling upon the Supreme Being to assist them in their affliction ! But, what \" affliction,\" on this side the grave, can equal that of living VOL. I. H"], [138, "98 VENICE. under a government, which, though professing the same religion, nevertheless withholds from its subjects the means of appealing to their Creator, in the mode which that religion enjoins? For even this cannot be done, without the sanc tion of the Aulic Chamber at Vienna ! Of all human sufferings, none are probably so truly galling as those which rankle in the breast of a noble, intellectual being \u2014 an Italian, for instance, sincere, unsuspicious, complaisant, polite, and yielding \u2014 when he finds himself duped and betrayed by a brutal and ignorant clown, whose only talent consists in low roguery! How humiliating it must be for Venetians to lie at the pleasure {mercy, it were idle to say), and the policy of Germans, Englishmen can scarcely conceive. Thraldom, under the yoke of fo reigners \u2014 and such foreigners ! \u2014 is a condition unknown to Britons. Long may they continue to be thus ignorant ! And long may they know how to appreciate the unrivalled blessings which they enjoy, under their ancient and invaluable system of government ! With respect to the religion of the Venetians, there can be no doubt that the worship of the Deity exists, in its full sense, in a city abound ing in churches, rich in every description of sacred ornaments, parishes abundantly supplied"], [139, "99 VENICE. with clergy, and hospitals administering to the wants of, and serving as asylums for, suffering humanity. In conformity with the primitive spirit of their institution, the clergy are excluded from any interference in matters of government. The curates are elected by the people in their respective parishes. The several religious ceremonies at Venice are conducted with as much pomp and show as in any other part of Italy ; and with the utmost decency, order, and propriety. I have been informed, that at one of the ceremonies in St. Mark's Church, whilst all the senators, the Venetian nobility of both sexes, and an immense congre gation, were on their knees at their devotions, an Englishman was observed standing : seeing this, one of the senators went up to him, and with great politeness informed him, it was ne cessary that he should comply with the usual custom. To which the Englishman answered, \" that he did not believe in transubstantiation.\" \" Nor I,\" replied the senator ; \" but, go down on your knees instantly, or walk out of the church.\" All religions are tolerated at Venice. The inhabitants used to bury their dead under their churches, there being no other cemetery ; but, since the revolution, it has been found necessary, h2"], [140, "100 VENICE. the better to avoid many inconveniencies, to inter the deceased in the different islands. The Jews, however, were always obliged to bury their relatives at Lido, three miles from the city. The Greeks at Venice have an archbishop, who exercises all the episcopal functions of their religion. He has also a seminary for young men coming from Greece, or from the islands. The day on which I went to their mass the archbishop himself officiated. I happened acci dentally to be seated near one of these youths, who informed me, that he was a native of the confines of Epirus in Thessaly, and lived in the district of the former residence of the Oracle of Dodona. The Greek mass and ceremony differ much from the Latin. Every one, on entering the church, gives a slight inclination of the body, his face being towards the door ofthe sanctuary of the altar ; which is the only one in the temple. eir entranceand arrival at the altar the audience make an immense number of signs of the cross, with the thumb against the fore head, then right and left, from one extremity to the other, retiring reverentially with a bend of the knee ; advancing afterwards to the altar, and bowing, one after the other, with signs of the most fervent devotion."], [141, "101 VENICE. The paintings which are hung on the walls conceal from the people and the choristers what is passing within the sanctuary. When it is lowered like a curtain, every one retires respect fully, and seats himself. The archbishop, on entering, attended by his seminary, goes through the same ceremony, before he puts op his epis copal robes to say mass ; which is performed by the individuals of his suite. During the cere mony of mass, the sanctuary is closed, and is only opened at times for the orations to the people, whose voices accompany the benedic tion ; and for the reception of the space that is consecrated for the choristers, and which is held in great respect. The rest of the ceremony consists of singing and prayer. The person who officiates is enclosed in the sanctuary. The prayer composed for St. John Chrysoslom, the celebrated patriarch of Constantinople, is re sponded to by the people, with a fervour corres ponding to the object ; while the choristers chaunt, and the singing boys unite their voices with all their strength. The shutting up of the sanctuary, during the performance ofthe liturgy, surprised me the more, as I had been given to understand that the contrary was the practice in the primitive ages of the Greek church."], [142, "102 VENICE. In the Armenian church there are two altars ; the one shut up like that of the Greeks ; the other placed in the middle of the church, for the private masses. At one of these I assisted one Sunday : it lasted seven hours, beginning early in the morning, and ending at mid-day. The ceremony, in which the people were allowed to take a part, consisted in a young lad putting on and taking off surpluses, and other eccle siastical insignia, of different colours and shapes, at least twenty times ; in lighting a wax torch, and anon extinguishing it ; in pacing ra pidly up and down the church, and then resting himself to take breath ; and in placing his thumb or handkerchief on his nether lip. During this, the chaunting of the bishop was heard from the sanctuary ; which was now and then opened, and again shut. The bishop was a very short man, with a most agreeable and intelligent countenance. His pontifical robes were magni ficent: instead of a mitre, he wore a Swiss col lege black cap. In the middle of the mass which was going on in the sanctuary, one of the attendants commenced mass at the second altar, in rather a low tone of voice. There was, in his demeanour and different attitudes, while officiating at the altar, that unaffected ele-"], [143, "VENICE. 103 gance of deportment, which painters denominate \" the grand style.\" As he wore a long, thick, white beard, the appearance of this very extra ordinary personage somewhat withdrew my attention from the old gossips by whom I was surrounded, and whose conversation entirely turned on the disputes and tittle-tattle of their respective families and friends. When the whole was over, I exclaimed from the bottom of my heart, Te Deum laudamus ! I have heard it said, that the Greeks and Armenians were under certain restrictions, with regard to the exercise of their religious worship. I know not what may have been the case else where, but certainly there were none such at Venice, under the Republic ; as they were only enjoined silence upon those articles which sepa rated them from the Roman church. On the contrary, the Venetians were constantly restrain ing the Catholic clergy from practising sundry impositions. The Inquisition was one of the greatest securi ties against the abuses ofthe clergy, more than of any other class of subjects. The people were often indebted for their lives and liberties to that much-talked-of and much abused tribunal ; which never exercised its functions, but in the same way as the English House of Peers interposes its"], [144, "104 VENICE. power, between the crown and the people. It was a balance, which prevented the Venetian nobility from usurping undue authority, and kept the people in subjection to the laws ofthe state. With regard to liberty of speech, no people on earth enjoyed a larger portion of it than the Venetians. Every coffee-house was a public place of debate. Even St. Mark's Square was often the resort, where the utterance given to political opinions would make the Procuratia resound with the arguments in favour of this state, and against the other state, during the wars that took place, and especially on the breaking out of the fatal French revolution. I am not a Venetian ; but a twenty years' intercourse with all ranks and classes of that interesting and much injured people, thus au thorizes me to detail facts which have come within my own knowledge, and to assert boldly the honest truth, to the best of my recollection and ability."], [145, "105 CHAPTER XI. VENICE. Reflections on the Conduct pursued by Buonaparte towards the Italian States And on the Imitation qf that Conduct by those who have succeeded him in the Usurpation of the Country. I shall now offer a few observations and reflections on the conduct which has been pur sued towards the Italian States, not only by Buonaparte, but by those who have succeeded him in the conquest and government of that ill-fated portion of Europe. Attached as I passionately am to a country, so celebrated for its natural beauties and its clime, and so distinguished for centuries as the seat of arts and the sciences ; and having, for a space of more than twenty mortal years, witnessed her misfortunes, and been, from a matrimonial alliance, a sharer therein, I cannot help entertaining the pleasing hope, that the day will arrive, when Italy, fair Italy, shall be liberated from, her present enthralled condition. Possessing a thorough acquaintance with the"], [146, "106 VENICE. language of the country, and having lived on terms of the closest intimacy with many indi viduals who were both civilly and politically employed in its government, I have drawn my facts from authentic sources, and particularly that portion of them which relates to the con duct of Buonaparte towards the people of Italy. I arrived in that beautiful kingdom at a period of life when the faculties qf the mind were expanding themselves with the milk and honey of blooming youth \u2014 untainted by false impres sions, unfettered by rank prejudices. The best days of my existence were passed under that happy sky. There were my limited talents cul tivated; there were they flattered and admired; and the hospitality I so generously met with at the hands ofthe natives \u2014 by whom I was looked upon as their countrywoman \u2014 induced me to adopt the once happy soil as my second patria. Circumstances connected with the troubles of the times afterwards compelled me to withdraw myself from the continent, and return to my native land. Experience has taught me, neither to court the smiles ofthe great, nor to fear their unmerited frowns. It has been my endeavour, throughout the following observations and re flections, to steer as clear from party prejucices, as it is possible for one to do, whose heart is"], [147, "107 V E N I C E. still bleeding from the effects of the envenomed shafts which family misfortunes have there im planted. I have ever loved my country, and revered the principles of her inimitable system of government ; which, like her own sturdy oak, after enduring for centuries the \" pel tings of the pitiless storm,\" has grown up to maturity. I have ever mistrusted the mania of modern philosophers for violent changes, and their idle notions of human perfectibility ; well con vinced, that the tendency of their cold and selfish principles was to deluge Europe with blood, and to undermine the palladium of re ligion ; \u2014 a general toleration of which is, in my mind, the first principle that unites civilized society, and the brightest ornament of the English Constitution. From the influence of his revolutionary sys tem upon all classes of mankind, Buonaparte has inflicted on Europe the deadly curse of an unsettled generation. In consequence of that fatal influence, I was necessitated to spend several years of my life away from my family, in different countries ; where the sight of the misery to which the people were reduced, by that pernicious system, afforded me ample means of examining into those old grievances, which they had been induced to exchange for new"], [148, "108 VENICE. and uncertain advantages ; \u2014 advantages never to be realized, and not for a moment to be put in competition with the blessings they had lost ; namely, moral principle, integrity, tranquillity, confidence between man and man ! Such were the effects of Buonaparte's systeme ego'iste ! Let me intreat some of the upper classes in this country steadily to bear in mind, that the French Revolution set out with a reform levelled at the property of individuals, and not against the above principles. Let them recollect that, in order to get possession of that property, hatred, malice, and every degree of wickedness, were lurking under the foul disguise, until the nefarious object had been accomplished. Who were the victims of private assassinations ? who were massacred in the prisons ? who were daily butchered at the public scaffolds ? \u2014 the mis guided nobility, persons of rank and fortune, rich and peaceable merchants, fathers of fami lies, honest and quiet housekeepers ! The executions against the rebel mob only took place when Buonaparte had no further occasion for their services ; and then, when they became clamorous for the blood-money, the promised reward of their services, they were put to death, from a fear that they might discover their employers. These are facts which"], [149, "109 VENICE. cannot be disputed, as they notoriously occurred wherever Buonaparte made his appearance with his army of regenerators ; and such conduct on his part was the more unpardonable, as some of the best writers of France had been employed by the Corsican in composing, and in circulating all over Italy, works containing the soundest principles, and enforcing the strictest order and discipline. \" Les Italiens,\" says Madame de Stael, whom I had the honour to be intimately acquainted with, in the years 1791 and 1792, as well as with Monsieur and Madame Neckar ; \" les Italiens sont plus remarquables par ce qu'ils ont ete, et par ce qu'ilspourront etre, que par ce qu'ils sont maintenant.\" The sentimentis a correct one; but, Madame de Stael saw the Italians at a time when it was almost impossible to give a decided opinion respecting them ; and, though I entertain the greatest respect for the talents of that extraor dinary woman, as well as for her private virtues, I cannot help differing with her, as to the general character of that people, and of thinking them still capable of shewing themselves worthy descendants of the conquerors of the world. Strike off the head of a man, and the body becomes a useless trunk. The head of the Italians, considered as a nation, has long since"], [150, "110 VENICE. been struck off by their foreign oppressors, who have most unwisely and impolitically kept them divided ; and which state of division has ever had, and must continue to have, a decided influ ence on the moral energies of a great people. If it be absolutely necessary to divide a nation, in consequence of that nation having be come the mistress of the world, why was France, after the dethronement of Napoleon, left in statu quo ? The present race of Italians exhibit the dis tressing spectacle of a body of nineteen millions of men, wanting the energies of a head. Who have been their sovereigns ? And, what have those sovereigns done for them, during the space of seven centuries ? They have been schooling them in the lessons of the ancient Greek masters, who, after the execrable Sylla had destroyed Greece, taught the people to forget their past condition, instead of improving their morals, and enlarging their virtues. Buonaparte divided the Italians still more than their preceding yoke-masters had done. Take a lion, or any other savage animal, draw his teeth, pare the nails of his paws, and the creature becomes tame as a lady's lap-dog. So it is at present with the Italians. Misery, and division upon division, have annihilated their"], [151, "VENICE. 111 former fierte of character ; and I am sorry to add, that the conduct observed towards them by the successor of the exile of St. He lena, is little calculated to better their con dition ! Spell-bound by the rapid ascension of that ambitious rocket, hurled from the revolutionary mortar, the several cabinets of Europe, not excepting that of St. James, appear to have imagined, that an imitation, on their part, ofthe conduct of that Scourge of the Universe must inevitably be attended with success ; provided they took care to avoid those fatal errors which occasioned his overthrow. I allude to such extra vagant projects as the invasion of Spain and of Russia ; and more especially the latter, at such an advanced period of the year. What a puerile imbecility do notions Uke these betray ! As if an Omnipotent Maker of the Universe had but one mode of inflicting punishment on man ! As if tyranny, and fraud, and corruption, did not carry in their train the very elements of retributive justice ! Another striking proof, if any were wanted, of the general fatuity, is to be discovered in the rage for imitating Napoleon. For scarcely is there a private individual of any weight in society, who does not endeavour to inspire"], [152, "112 VENICE. those around him with a sort of respect, by casting over his own actions that sort of doubt and perplexity, which the French Emperor uniformly practised, allowing no one to guess what the resolves of the mighty man were to be! How silly, and at the same time how knavish this kind of conduct often is ! In deeds, perpe tuating his evil spirit ; in words, decrying and execrating his foul actions ! With one hand, begriming and pulling down the heraldic in signia of his rule \u2014 with the other, dispersing and sending about his image in every direc tion : the coin in circulation throughout France and Italy still bearing his image and super scription : one day tearing to pieces and vilifying that, which, on the next, they uphold and extol to the very skies ; reminding one of the eternal tod to which poets have condemned the wicked after death, for the crimes they were guilty of whde living \u2014 \" d Danai senus Infame, damnatusque longi Sisyphus \u00c6olides laboris.\""], [153, "113 CHAPTER XII.

The Subject continued. \u2014 Buonaparte considered as a General The Napoleon Military System described His Mode qf treating the Soldiers Strict Discipline qf his Armies Some qf the leading Causes qf his Overthrow pointed out Origin qf Revolutions in a State. Now that Napoleon is gone the way of all flesh, it is the fashion to eulogize and puff him off as a great man ; and, if the attempted pal liation were not intended as an apology for the adoption of his despotic measures, I should not be unwilling, to a certain extent, to join in the encomium. As a general, in the hour of battle, he shewed himself a god of war \u2014 a very Mars. Possessing a consummate knowledge of the military science, he was, for quickness of intellect and prompti tude of execution, altogether without a parallel. But, the thing which stamped him a general of the first rate was his always commencing the battle, and striking the first blow. For while he thereby infused the confidence of hope into VOL. I. i"], [154, "114 VENICE. his own troops, he generated the chill of despair into those of his adversary. He would not be dictated to by any mortal breathing. Accus tomed, by superior skill, to baffle the plans of his adversary, he ever took the lead, and preserved it to the last ; thereby striking terror and dismay into the bosoms of the stoutest. The carrying on of a defensive warfare he left for those feeble souls, who were either paralyzed through fear, cramped and fettered by respon sibility, or ignorant of human nature. And, did not Napoleon act wisely in so doing? Admitting the contending bodies to be of equal strength, is it not a fact, that the assailant is ever the most formidable ? Let us suppose the field of battle to be a billiard table : does not the propelled ball drive on the other ball ? In fact, so far from the resisting object having the advantage, it is not certain that it will ever have an opportunity of striking a single blow. The tactics of Hannibal were invariably those of assault. The wary Fabius has been lauded for his prudence, in standing upon the defensive ; when, in fact, he had no other alternative, in the miserable, derelict extremities of Rome, whose numerous legions had been successively de stroyed by the daring Carthaginian. The far famed retreats of Moreau, and of other great"], [155, "VENICE. 115 generals, not forgetting that of the Ten Thou sand Greeks, are feats of war which we take no delight in extolling. When speaking of discord and its furies \u2014 of the crush of battle and the shock of arms\u2014 it is the Macedonian, it is the Roman, it is the French Emperor, whose dread achievements elicit our wonder and admiration. It is the progress of the conqueror that we applaud. Suppose a couple of gladiators en gaged \u2014 the first lunge may disable the opponent for ever. In short, even in the brute creation, strength discovers itself in the same way ; the more feeble of the two very rarely commencing the onset. In a period of peace, indeed, the case is different. Then, the ministers of a country ought to be passive. To conquer the more surely, they ought to wait patiently ; success being ever the object in view. Though by no means convinced of their originality, I am, furthermore, willing to allow that some of Napoleon's projects were vast in the extreme, and that they were arranged with a profound knowledge of universal society. Egyptians and Italians, Jews and Gentiles, he alike took a part in their concerns. Germans and Spaniards, Turks and Russians, were chess men, which he managed and moved to and fro i 2"], [156, "116 VENICE. like another Philidor, rendering them subsidiary to his renown, and tributary to his army ; which was composed of a portion of each. France he overawed by strangers, and all other nations by foreign bayonets. Lest effeminacy should creep in amongst them, his soldiers were never suffered to remain long in one place, but were marched to fresh quarters every three or four months : thus, flinging \" resty sloth\" to the dogs ; and, by keeping up their natural buoyancy and activity of spirits, preparing them for that strict discipline so essentially necessary in the hour of battle. Such men, in fact, were the veterans who perished in the snows of Russia. So accus tomed were they implicitly to execute the orders of their General, that none of the troops be longing to the other sovereigns of Europe had been able to cope with them. Neither ought England to repine at this ; since, in the plenitude of Napoleon's power, she achieved every thing that circumstances wrould admit of. Truly did that man exclaim, that to himself only was he indebted for his overthrow. Aye, and for all the disasters of the Russian expedition ! Had he panted less for an individuality of authority : had he, both as a monarch and a captain, sought for exclusive supremacy with an ardour a little"], [157, "117 VENICE. more tempered : had he been willing to share but a small portion of his laurels with his com panions in arms \u2014 Massena, Augereau, and the other mighty champions of democracy and of the French Republic, who had sprung up simul taneously with himself: had not the fumes of personal ambition, the venom of adulation, and the blandishments of vice, warped his talents and intoxicated his understanding : had not all these things taken place, a forest of heroes would, in defiance of the hyperborean blast, have grown up around his throne, and enabled him to laugh to scorn the combined efforts of his enemies. Buonaparte was more dreaded by the gene- rality of mankind than he was esteemed. This was abundantly shewn in the critical moment of his authority. Had he practised less cunning and low shuffle, he would have shewn himself a better politician. \" Aye, to be sure,\" have exclaimed some, \" the unfortunate always com- mit errors !\" Although the sentiment is sarcas- tically thrown out, it is nevertheless a just one. And, of all the crowned heads, Buonaparte was assuredly the most culpable : since, the man who had not been brought up from his youth in the trammels of royalty ; who had had far better opportunities than the offspring of Kings, of i 3"], [158, "118 VENICE. studying human nature, and of thereby avoiding its prejudices, ought, above all things, not to have forfeited the regard of the people, by the resumption of those most tyrannical and op pressive ordinances, to overturn which the French Revolution had exploded. Reckless of the consequences, he studied too, in imitation of the other powers, to bring about a plethora in the body politic, by increasing, beyond all due proportion, the uppermost ranks of society. Now, whenever the vital sap ceases to flow in the minor and inferior vessels, a para lysis, or some other fatal crisis, necessarily ensues. When the subordinate parts become lifeless and parched up, the whole fabric soon totters before the blast, and the first hurricane levels it in the dust. When we shall see a wise limitation organized against every inordinate amplification of property, then, and not till then, shall I consider, that an advancement really and truly beneficial has been effected in the science of legislation ; convinced, as I am, that the enormous disparity which exists between the property and possessions of mankind, is the great origin and well-spring of moral evil. Not that I would, on any account, recommend a sudden revulsion. I would merely propose an amelioration, founded upon the immutable"], [159, "119 VENICE. dictates of nature. As for the convulsions and revolutions of society, who that has endeavoured to search after truth, in the depth of her re cesses, does not know, that the very schemes which are planned for the prevention of those convulsions, invariably concoct and bring them to maturity ? For, whenever a pressure becomes too excessive to be endured, the consequences, as we well know from fatal experience, are inevitable. I do not say, as so many others have done, that \" the people rebel.\" On the contrary, I assert, that there is no such thing as the spontaneous setting in motion of a mass so besotted as, time out of mind, \" the people\" have proved them- selves to be. Those books of history, which tell us to the contrary, are the effusions of ig- norance or of falsehood. Of cour se I am speaking of decided and downright revolutions ; and which revolutions have invariably had their origin from some other quarter than that of the yawning and ignorant canaglia. An extreme cupidity at the fountain head of the Govern- ment \u2014 a sucking eagerness at the mouth, to the exhaustion of the other parts of the body \u2014 rapine on the part of pro-consuls at their dis tant seats of government, who, in the space of a few years, return to the mother-country, i 4"], [160, "120 VENICE. not merely with their shattered fortunes re paired, but abounding in wealth \u2014 these, these are the things which bring ruin to an empire ! Remote provinces have ever been the scenes of pillage and of malversation \u2014 even in the times of ancient Rome. First came Asia. She was subdued by the force of arms. Her luxuries, together with her wealth, found their way into Italy. Circum stances again changed ; and, after the accu mulated treasures had, in the lapse of a few centuries, disappeared, the taste for Asiatic aro matics, drapery, and what not, rather increased than declined. So that subsequently, and after the chains of vassalage had been broken in Asia, its inhabitants continued to hold Rome tributary ; and more than retrieved \u2014 more than avenged \u2014 their former misfortunes. \u2014 \" Nunc patimur long\u0153 pads mala : savior armis \" Luxuria incubuit, victumque ulciscitur orbem.'' \" Now, all the evils of long peace are ours ; \" Luxury, more terrible than hostile powers, \" Her baleful influence wide around has hurl'd, i< And well aveng'd the subjugated world.\" * Gilford's Juvenal ."], [161, "121 CHAPTER XIII. VENICE. The Subject continued The Napoleon Military System of Government further inquired into Its Effects on the Customs and Habits ofthe French People Napoleon's deeds id and crafty Policy exposed His Surrender to the British And Death at St. Helena. But, to bring my theory down to more modern times, and more recent vicissitudes. Turning the cabinet into the camp, we find Napoleon studying political economy more like a General than a Sovereign. Trade he des pised ; commerce he crushed : while, on the other hand, he exacted enormous contributions for the support of his armies. If poverty be contemptible, he took the sure and certain way of rendering all those who were concerned in traffic, objects of thorough derision. And so far was his hatred towards England satiated ; for he had certainly the satisfaction of seeing his followers regarding \" la nation boutiquiere \" with actual scorn. Now, in the then state of things, such a line of conduct was fraught with intolerable evils."], [162, "122 VENICE. Had the military habits been free from licen- tiousness, then indeed would the degradation of commerce have been attended with conse- quences less fatal, than those in which he soon found himself involved. But, Napoleon was par- tial and unjust \u2014 a capricious upstart\u2014 in many instances, a tyrant \u2014 possessing less ofthe univer- sal ken of the eagle, than of the limited vision ofthe hawk ; more of the cunning ofthe lawyer, than of the sterling wisdom of the legislator ; thereby proclaiming himself, as it were, the true son of the attorney of Ajaccio. Such was the fatal misprision of his system of civil govern- ment, that his whole kingdom, nay, all Europe, became a sort of general barrack, a garrison, a species of tented field, subject to martial regu- lations. The military mania spread far and wide ; and thus were the locusts, the harpies, the sluggards, permitted to nestle and swarm amidst a miserable population, unable to resist their insufferable vexations, and incapable of appeasing their manifold cravings \u2014 whether of external vanity and parade, or of vitiated and depraved appetite. Throughout France, every thing appeared to be done for the accommodation of the army. Her theatres, her public walks, her coffee-houses, her restaurateurs, and her gardens, all served as"], [163, "VENICE. 123 so many focuses of recreation for the officers. Ask for a breakfast at a Paris hotel, and the waiter will fetch it for you from the neighbour ing cafe. Indeed, there is hardly any such thing in France as an English fireside \u2014 a home ! Strangers of moderate fortune, in passing through Paris, resort to coffee-houses and traiteurs for their meals ; as they generally find it more comfortable to do so than to take them at their lodgings. Frenchmen, it is true, are fond of society to an extreme ; great babblers ; and more occupied with other people's concerns than with their own domestic affairs, which they leave almost entirely to the ladies. This rage for gadding about, and gossipping, and making visits, is more or less prevalent all over the Continent ; and by it the mental ener gies become greatly exhausted. Nor can I exone rate a considerable portion of my fair country women from the like imputation. Nay, the very trees and houses in France partake of the same gregarious character. In Burgundy, for instance, and in several other provinces, many a fertile spot is to be seen, upon which, for seven or eight miles together, not a rustic hut or shed is to be discovered, nor any signs of social life ; although the deserted fields are abundant in the productions of Ceres and"], [164, "124 VENICE. Pomona ; reminding one of those fairy tales, which describe the sudden appearance of sump tuous banquets magically raised, without the intervention of human agency, and only wit nessed by the sweet warblers of the grove. In a moment, however, we arrive at some populous city ; and, straight, the face of every thing be comes changed ! As for the trees, we find them huddled together in clumps, in small woods, or, soldier- like, in rank and file, and in platoons. Geometrical figures, of all shapes and sizes, are rigidly adhered to, in the laying out of their groves and gardens, by the French planters of the leafy tribe. Nature, which ought \" never to be forgot,\" is entirely lost sight of. All is formal \u2014 all is monotonous \u2014 all is stiff \u2014 No pleasing intricacies intervene, No artful wildness to perplex the scene ; Grove nods at grove, each alley has a brother, And half the platform just reflects the other.\" What shocked me most, undei the Napoleon sway, was the intrusion of the soldiery, dressed in full uniform, up to the very altars of the churches : an impious, daring, and most odious custom this, which now, or at least very recently, was permitted by his Imperial Majesty of Aus tria. While every one is kneeling before the"], [165, "125 VENICE. image of God, and intent upon his worship, neither by genuflexion, nor by the taking off of caps, nor by any other outward signs of devotion, do the soldiery join in the ceremony ! Some slight inclination of the body may possibly take place, on the elevation of the host ; but that, I believe, is all. These irreverent practices were especially observed by the French, in the time of their Emperor ; and the Germans, in Italy, have not been behind -hand in follow ing the example ; to the great scandal of true religion. Why admit soldiers, or indeed any one, into their sanctuaries, who will not consent to adhere to the prescribed ritual ? Surely no reasonable mortal can object to uncover his head, in a place consecrated to the worship of the Supreme Being, when the rest of the audience are all doing the same. As for the impious remark of intoxicated presumption, that soldiers should obey no orders but those of their General, and that the practice I am reprobating has been in vogue time immemorial, I need only refer to the natural disposition of the soul upon ven turing into battle, and that involuntary recourse in spirit, to the God of Battles, which takes place during the existence of imminent danger, whether by sea or land. The most eminent of"], [166, "126 VENICE. heroes have, in all ages, discovered the pro soundest reverence for the Deity ; and, in proof of the correctness of my assertion, I could adduce recent instances, from the conduct of some of our own most distinguished naval and military commanders. But to return to the views and projects of Napoleon. His eagle, as I before said, was ahawk. That Roman expansive ken, and that great ness of soul, which none of the other powers of Europe at all understood, the French failed to attain. The mind of their chief, cramped in a great degree by local admeasurements, and narrowed by constant calculations and the details of a field of battle, passed over other interests of paramount importance. All classes of the community were rendered subordinate to his troops ; as if the profession of arms was alone deserving of notice \u2014 thereby proving him self to be a soldier, and little or nothing beyond it. Whatever his demonstrations to the contrary may have been, there can scarcely be a doubt, that his talents were chiefly confined to the science of war. A sovereign should strive to be like the Almighty \u2014 wise, impartial, true, beneficent, and just. Now, without stopping to inquire in what degree the divine attributes here enumerated"], [167, "127 VENICE. were or were not discoverable in the actions of the individual in question, I shall, for the present, only advert to the third ; namely, his love of truth : and although the vox populi is not in all instances the vox Dei \u2014 there being but a very slender portion of celestial intelli gence shed over the minds of the multitude \u2014 yet, in the common opinion, which charges Buo naparte with a total indifference to this God-like quality, I in a great measure acquiesce. And his extraordinary abilities only serve to aggra vate his guilt ; since talent is the knowledge of truth, and a gift of God : consequently the suppression of the boon is a flying in the face of the Great Giver. His deceitful and crafty policy \u2014 that evil spirit, whose deadly influence appears to pervade the great mass of society \u2014 low, and corrupt, and base, and wretched as it is, clung to him to the last. It is my conscientious conviction, that the sole drift of his outrageous hostility against Sir Hudson Lowe, the vigilant Governor of St. Helena, was to stir up a commotion in the island. Had he succeeded in gaining a free intercourse with the garrison, he would next have tampered with the officers. Neither have I the charity to suppose that he would not have so far succeeded in seducing"], [168, "128 VENICE. some of them, as to have weakened, to a certain degree, their allegiance to their own Sovereign. Not that I entertain the least doubt of the fidelity of British officers. Nevertheless, in what way a constant intercourse at St. Helena with such a man as the tremendous Napoleon \u2014 a de posed Emperor too ! \u2014 united to his consummate skill in fathoming character, might have ope rated on individuals of his own profession, it would be difficult to predict. Many a man has passed for a traitor, merely because he has been unable to refuse a solicited favour, to every ap pearance trivial, but in reality rendered very important from circumstances. His hour was however come. The man who had entangled myriads in his snares \u2014 the man who had allured thousands by the melody of his promises \u2014 was at length caught in the very toils which he had himself invented. As the bar barous Muscovite learnt of Charles XII. of Sweden the mode of waging war, so were Napoleon's political tactics most sedulously studied, and most closely imitated. And, accordingly, he was at last taken by the same subtle and mellifluous contrivance of holiday promises. England was held up as the sole asylum for downcast sovereigns \u2014 the sanc tuary of safety \u2014 the city of refuge \u2014 the harbour"], [169, "VENICE. 129 of repose, and security, and freedom. Witness the Bourbons, and his own brother Lucien, and many others. Napoleon, therefore, fearlessly ascended the Bellerophon. But it turned out a monster to devour him. It was no chimera ! All, alas, was sad reality ; both as it regarded the remainder of his brief existence, as well as its awfully instruc tive termination \u2014 \" Mors solafatetur, Quantula sint hominum corpusada !\" CHAPTER XIV. VENICE. The Subject continued The Holy Alliance described Return to the Condition of Italy under the Austrian yoke Impracticability of assimilating the German and Italian character. Having said thus much with regard to the policy of Napoleon, it will naturally be expected that I should next touch upon the conduct of those who have succeeded him in the govern ment of the affairs of Europe. The reader must not, however, expect me to enter too minutely into a subject, which, at every turn, is VOL. I. K"], [170, "130 VENICE. fraught with so much inconvenience, \u2014 disclaim ing, as I do, certain personalities. Let the base reptiles remain in their lurking holes, for the present : only the ostensible personages shall be now noticed by me. \" The Holy Alliance !\" How awful, how presumptuous, the appellation ! Trenching closely on the attributes of Divinity itself ; and thereby challenging inquiry, how far they deserve the assumed Vicegerency. As far as my limited faculties enable me to form a judgment, the labours of this alliance have tended, hitherto, to rivet more closely the chains forged for the sufferers by their Corsican oppressor. The \"holy\" copartnership proclaim, that their prerogatives do not emanate from the people, but come down upon them, like the mantle of Elijah, from the Godhead itself! Good. And therefore am I the more completely justified in balancing against the divine attri butes which they assume, the actual conduct of the several potentates who are parties to the said holy \u2014 most holy \u2014 alliance ! But, where should I find language sufficiently powerful to convey to my reader the actual result of such an inquiry ? On one hand, the arrogance of the creature, and his feeble and imperfect and confined and variable notions of"], [171, "VENICE. 131 things the most simple ! On the other hand, the God of Nature, who \u2014 Though chang'd in all, is still in all the same, Great in the earth as in th' ethereal frame ; Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees ; Lives through all life, extends through all extent ; Spreads undivided, operates unspent; Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part, As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart; As full, as perfect, in vile Man that mourns, As the rapt seraph that adores and burns ; To Him no high, no low, no great, no small ; He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.\" These sublunary monarchs, with their hun dred eyes, are incessantly on the watch, pry ing about, lest any of their bondsmen should escape their vigilance, and devising innume rable projects to shut out the rays of truth ; whereas, the Almighty lives in light \u2014 \" for God is light ; And never but in unapproached light, Dwelt from eternity.\" The most artful impediments have been thrown, by these monarchs, in the way of every individual who may, at any time, have been anxious to promote the genuine happiness of mankind. Every such individual has been k 2"], [172, "132 VENICE. branded as a jacobin, a demagogue, a ruffian, a rebel. The foulest slanders have been heaped upon his head. He trembles at the atrocious injustice which he experiences at the hands of mortals who have usurped to themselves the characteristics of divinity ; and, though feeling a consciousness of his ability to re-invigorate the fallen energies of his countrymen, and to restore to them the blessings which they have forfeited, as much by feebleness as by direct corruption \u2014 such a phalanx of demons uprear their furious crests in terrific array before him - such innu merable difficulties and dangers beset him in his path \u2014 that he stops short appalled ; and, without giving a free utterance to his indignant feelings, he leaves it to God, in his own good time, to speed the righteous work, through the operation of his Almighty power. After reflections like these, the mind involun tarily turns to the condition of Italy, as I have pourtrayed that condition in the early pages of this volume ; and, if I were to confine myself to the present state of the Venetian territory, the observations which it would be my duty to make thereon would apply equally to the rest of the newly acquired German dominions. The same unfeeling schemes of plunder are every where pursued ; many of them introduced by the"], [173, "133 VENICE. French, those ministers of rapine, and continued since their defeat, under various pretexts \u2014 exactions, grievous in point of substance, and galling beyond measure to the feelings ; trea chery ; a false representation of things ; expres sions replete with the semblance of compassion, but, in reality, altogether hollow and delusive. Instead of genuine sympathy, accompanied with positive redress, some new device is con stantly resorted to, to increase the sufferings of the miserable Italians ; absolutely forcing upon their memories the language of Scripture. The German tyrants seem to be aware that their power can be but of short duration ; and there fore are they striving to make the most of it. Be that as it may, the wretched sufferers ex claim, that \" Satan has overtaken them in great wrath.\" Venice, once the emporium of all Eu rope, is become a \" waste howling wilderness.\" The rapid disappearance, within the space of a few years, of the immense treasures of that city, announces an entire dislocation of society and a total defacement of her beautiful edifices, at no very distant period, if her present masters should persevere in the harsh and unfeeling conduct towards her, which they have hitherto adopted. It is unmanly and base, it is cruel and infamous, to trample thus on the prostrate K 3"], [174, "134 VENICE. victim, reduced to the extreme of languor, by protracted and accumulated misfortunes. Let us, however, hope for better days ; and that the sun of England's glory will, ere long, extend a portion of its generous rays to depressed Italy ! Indeed, I cannot help entertaining a belief, that the friends of suffering humanity will not relax an iota of their exertions, until the entire of that magnificent country shall have had its injuries redressed\u2014 a country, compared with which the much vaunted France is a mere warren, a cheerless desert, a bleak and hungry waste. Not that I mean to represent the latter kingdom as a barren wilderness, if duly cul tivated : I only wish to throw out, that France, and, generally speaking, the soil of all the other countries of Europe, are sterile, when brought in competition with Venetian Lombardy, and other portions of the territory of the former Queen of the terraqueous globe. During the summer season, almost every tree in it is loaded with fruit of the most delicious quality. In despite of neglect, and of obstacles of all sorts, the earth teems with every blessing which Pro vidence, in his bounty, has bestowed on his creatures ; and that in such abundance, as to astonish every traveller coming from beyond the Alps."], [175, "135 VENICE. But, \" for whose use,\" I ask, is the sky of Italy so pure \u2014 its air so mild and serene\u2014 its earth so prolific ? Hear the answer of Austria : \" 'Tis for mine ; For me kind Nature wakes her genial pow'r, Suckles each herb, and spreads out ev'ry flow'i* ; Annual for me the grape, the rose, renew The juice nectarious, and the balmy dew ; For me the mine a thousand treasures brings, For me health gushes from a thousand springs ; Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise ; My footstool earth, my canopy the skies.\" O, what delightful country seats could the English, with their excellent taste for laying out grounds, erect in Italy ; where it is quite common to see bowers formed of the lime-tree and the vine, bending under a superabundant product ! In proof of my assertion, I ap peal to every one who has been fortunate enough to see the grounds of the English gentry settled in Italy ; for instance, the gardens of my friend and countrywoman, the Countess de Durfort, who resides at a short distance from Venice. And then, again, as to paintings and the other productions of the fine arts ; more of them are to be met with in any one of the great cities of Italy \u2014 Rome, Florence, Venice, &c, k 4"], [176, "136 VENICE. than in all France \u2014 throwing Germany into the bargain ! To behold regions on every side thus rich and populous, groaning under a yoke forged for them by hordes of drowsy, lubberly Aus trians, who come down in droves from the Tyrolean mountains, at all seasons of the year, with packs on their backs, containing scarcely a second garment, to the dismay of the poor Italian, who therein foresees, with renewed anguish, the augmentation of his own miseries, and the metamorphosis, in the space of two or three years, of these beggarly intruders, into stern, and hard-hearted, and wealthy pro prietors \u2014 to behold, I say, this fine, intelligent people mixed up with the dull, clod-hopping Germans, reminds one of the amalgamation of lead with quicksilver ; the jumbling together of masses the most heterogeneous. We often hear of the marriage of a beautiful and accomplished female to a clumsy boor or a drunken sot ; and of the union of a man of sober disposition and enlightened understanding with a fiery virago, a very Zantippe, who stamps and storms about the house, while the worthy husband is calmly occupied in solving some difficult problem ap pertaining to the regions of intellect \u2014 recalling to our recollection the actual existence of the"], [177, "VENICE. 137 iron age, and the wars of the Titans against heaven \u2014 the attempt, in short, to repress and subdue spirit by gross and inert matter. Of the various nations of Europe, the Ger mans are the most doltish, the Italians the most sprightly ; and the approximation of the two affords a fresh instance of the contact which frequently takes place between extremes. Such a state of things, however, is never lasting. Either an amelioration of condition, or an en tire separation between the parties must take place. And, confident I am, that the very first Englishman who shall fly to the rescue of the fair dames of Italy, will find them impatient for flight, and eager to escape from the tobacco fumes, and the gin, and the sauer kroute, and the other German messes ; not to mention the innu merable restraints, past all endurance, imposed on them by their detested paramours. For my part, I am at all times inclined to trust very much to national character ; and, as Englishmen are well known to be as prompt in lending their assistance to suffering humanity, as they are alive to the slightest rumour of delin quency, we may reasonably look for the bene ficial interference of the British Government, as soon as it shall become truly instructed; with respect to the real condition of Italy, and"], [178, "138 VENICE. the miserable plight to which a horde of unre lenting tyrants have reduced her, by their unheard-of cruelties and their most atrocious exactions. CHAPTER XV. VENICE. German Attempts to improve Italian Edifices Enumeration of the Distresses occasioned at Venice by the tcretcked state ofthe Coinage. Only the other year all Venice was in a state of agitation, from the Austrians having taken it into their precious noddles to place the entire city on fresh legs. In other words, the wise acres discovered, that some of the houses stood in need of new foundations. And, sure enough, the streets have assumed an appearance at once straight, formal, and monotonous \u2014 stiff as a file of musketeers, and (to give Old Nick his due) certainly somewhat more cleanly than they were accustomed to be. But, why these same external alterations should have been set on foot, while the means of replenishing the inside of the habitations were unfeelingly with-"], [179, "139 VENICE. held, is a point only to be cleared up by a reference to the uniform policy of Francis's predecessor ; namely, the obliterating of an cient forms, and the thereby paving the way for impressions of a different description. For such an undertaking, excuses would not of course be wanted. The leading one was, that the inhabitants were in constant danger of having their houses tumbled about their ears. We often see this propping and shoring work, on a small scale, going on in the purlieus of Covent Garden, and in sundry parts of our metropolis, where it has really been called for ; but, in Venice,where the walls of the houses are extremely stout and substantial, and where no horses or waggons are moving to and fro to shake them, the undertaking alluded to only served to increase, if possible, the general odium in which the Germans were already held by the people of that city. Whatever your barbarians cannot mend, they uniformly take especial care to mar. For instance, the public buildings which, in the glorious time of the Republic, were as free of access as the churches, or nearly so, are now closed against the people, and can only be visited through the medium of a fee. Admittance to the Ducal Palace, which is a suite of saloons, the walls"], [180, "140 VENICE. and ceilings of which still glow with the pro ductions of Titian, Paulo Veronese, Tintoretto, and other inimitable masters, presenting a source of the purest delight to persons of taste and science, has been interdicted by these animals, who have no relish for these noble and sublime specimens of genius. Talk of the Goths and the Vandals ! their barbarism might perhaps have shewn itself in shapes of greater ferocity ; but I verily believe, that their yoke was not accompanied with more direful consequences, than those which the German sway will ultimately produce through- out Italy. The \" paternal \" government of His Imperial Majesty is ostentatiously boasted of on every public occasion. His extreme so- licitude, and that of the individuals employed under him, for the general good, is pompously trumpeted forth, whenever an opportunity presents itself; while facts, of the most damn- ing description, give the lie to the averment. Nakedness, and poverty, and beggary, are hydras which might, at least, silence these unfeeling men. But no : the obstinacy of the dolts is proverbial, and the Italians in their employ (chiefly strangers to the city, or if born in it, persons of no character or note) acquiesce in all their measures. Indeed, the crafty Ger-"], [181, "141 VENICE. mans take care to give it out, that every one of the grievances which the people are made to endure, is not suggested by themselves, but is the work of some of their own countrymen. I was myself informed by Count Thurn, the Delegato, or sub-governor of Venice, with an air of great regard for the person named, who the projector was of the recent repairs of the foundations above-mentioned. The name I have forgotten ; but I could readily discover, that the object was to induce a belief, that neither the Count himself, nor any of his col leagues, had the least hand in the business. And, similar tricks are but too generally resorted to \u2014 the executive sending forth its mandates from a masked battery, which no mortal is per mitted to explore. At Venice, the people pronounce the go vernor to be in fault ; the canaille cry out shame on the sovereign ; while others, who affect to be more in the secret, impeach, by name, some two or three of the counsellors of state ; who probably, after all, enjoy a smaller portion of influence than those who are kept more in the back-ground. Sometimes the civil, at others the military authorities are condemned ; and, to wind up the \" sad eventful history,\" the wretched citizens of Venice are heartily sick"], [182, "142 VENICE. of their numerous oppressors, and, in the bitter ness of disappointment, wish both soldiers and sailors, commissaries and counsellors of state, aulic as well as hydraulic, who, one and all, strive only how they can best fleece them out of their last shilling \u2014 at the very devil. By hook or by crook, however, an enormous revenue is collected by Austria in the Venetian territories. From Padua, a boat-load of money is every Saturday evening conveyed to Venice ; whence it is forwarded, as may naturally be presumed, to Germany ; since none of it ever finds its way back ; and thus are the inhabitants drained to the last extreme of endurance ! Certain it is, that the Germans are held, throughout Italy, in greater dislike than the French ever were. The latter, though rapacious after money, spent it freely ; whereas, the former are the most niggardly race of mortals on the face of the earth, and even grudge to lay out twopence for a cup of coffee. In fine, the whole body of the Government are indifferent to the happiness and well-being of the people, and are only solicitous to amass fortunes for themselves. Some idea of the calamitous system pursued at Venice may be readily formed from the fol lowing well-attested facts, which relate only to"], [183, "143 VENICE. a solitary branch of the accursed tree, which seems destined to shroud in eternal night the re nowned Venetian Commonwealth. The regulations with regard to money \u2014 that primum mobile in the projects of political eno nomists \u2014 bear with a distressing weight on the poor of Venice, and tend to keep alive inces sant jars and wranglings between the shop keepers and the inhabitants; to encourage fraud; to facilitate swindling ; and to keep the city, from one end to the other, in a constant state of perplexity, irritation and confusion. Indeed, all the surrounding districts are alike a prey to the same diabolical contrivance \u2014 than which it would scarcely be possible to invent any thing more completely calculated to excite the furies of discord. And, alas ! while the native gulls are whirled and tossed about in the common tempest, the master sharks are seen revelling in every species of wanton luxury ! If any superficial observer should be inclined to suppose the mischief venial, because it only alights on those whom he may be pleased to call the inferior classes of society, I do not envy that person either his head or his heart. To come, however, to the point : every city pos sesses its tribe of money-changers ; but, in Venice the race is more numerous than in any"], [184, "144 VENICE. other ; and the cause is to be found in the nu merous abuses connived at, both there and in the surrounding districts. For a dollar of five franks \u2014 and little else but dollars of different mints are in circulation \u2014 no shopkeeper will give you small change, unless you will lay out a third of it in articles ; since the small cur rency bears an agio of no less than nearly five farthings upon a Napoleon crown, worth four shillings and twopence. Either, therefore, three or four livres (I am speaking, of course, of the Venetian livre, in value fivepence) must be spent at a single shop, out of the five-frank piece, or recourse must be had to the money changer ; who charges you two and a-half per cent, for so doing, more or less, according to the state of the exchange, the quality of the coin, or his own good pleasure. As for the vast diversity of coins in circula tion at Venice, each bearing a separate value, one would think they were brought thither from every corner of the globe, in order still further to annoy and perplex the wretched in habitants. The different kinds of German dol lars would alone form a moderate-sized collec tion ; and the sagacity of Midas himself would be puzzled to ascertain the intrinsic value of each. If, indeed, a plentiful supply of these"], [185, "145 VENICE. coins were seen flowing into the coffers of the Venetians, the mischief would comparatively be trifling ; but the reverse of this happens, unfor tunately, to be the case. Two prices therefore prevail, with reference to the small coin \u2014 the nominal, and the real ; and the consequence is, that the poor man almost invariably hies with his dollar to the money-changer, since he is not able to expend three livres, nor even two, at a single shop ; and it is not for the interest of the shopkeeper, on account of the said agio, to give change, unless goods to the amount of three livres should be purchased. I have frequently seen a Chevalier d' Industrie call for his cup of coffee, which costs about two pence, and in payment thereof throw down a five-frank piece. The waiter, of course, cannot give change, as the loss by so doing would amount to more than the cost of the cup of coffee. Upon this, the fur 'bone, after rapping out some half dozen score of oaths at the state of the money-market, repockets his crown-piece, and walks off without paying for his coffee. Others present a zecchino, worth above five-and twenty livres ; by which, however, the loss is not so great, since a couple of five-frank pieces and a livre or two, will about make up the sum. But the coffee-house keeper does not comply, VOL. I. L"], [186, "146 VENICE. unless he happens to have Spanish, or some crowns of the same value, to give ; having constantly an eye to the agio borne by the smaller coin. Verily, all this is most distressing work ! Fruit-stalls, and such like minor vents for com modities, present similar scenes of anxiety and irritation ; and thus are places, which ought to be scenes of cheerfulness and of tranquillity, as was wont to be the case in the happy days of the Republic, converted into so many dens of harpies, feverish, wrathful, and miserable ; and mainly through the pecuniary shackles of which I have been speaking. After the emplette, or bargain, has been struck, it is quite common, because the poor salesman cannot afford to give change, to see the articles flung back into the basket, to the loss of his custom, the damage of his wares, and his own bitter mortification ! From the above specimen, my reader will be able to form a pretty correct notion of what is called the Austrian government in Italy. If, in the agony of his spirit, the Venetian should venture upon a remonstrance, the only redress he obtains is some coarse German vulgarism ; some common-place rebuke expressed in a tone of bluff asperity ; some threat calculated to terrify him. Nor, indeed, is it to be expected"], [187, "147 VENICE. that those, whom the countless drubbings of the French have only served to render more proud and more brutal, should be troubled with any of the \" compunctuous visitings\" of nature. \" Beat out one devil, and you let in ten,\" is an old saying, which may justly be applied to them. Invariably obstinate, the Germans main tain that they never were beaten by Napoleon ; every untoward mischance they attribute to treachery. So true is it, that beings endowed with a certain crassitude of skull, cannot com prehend the power of intellect ; nor how it comes to pass, that ability and skill can achieve certain deeds, and the operations of mind pre vail over those of gross matter. Treachery may have done a little ; but the reader may rest assured, that it was by talent and by spirit that the victory was achieved. The expenses of the improvements which have recently taken place in the streets of Venice the proprietors of the houses have been compelled to defray. And thus has many a landlord forfeited his inheritance, together with the scanty annuity which he had saved out of the general wreck, and to which he looked up for his support in old age. Capital as well as interest, tenement as well as rent, have alike l 2"], [188, "148 VENICE. been raked into the gulph of unbounded avarice ; and thus has many an honest and humble indi vidual been deprived of his last shilling ! CHAPTER XVI. VENICE. Reflections on Architecture generally Its Origin The Grecian Style Palmyra The Egyptian Column Necessity of a Petrific Standard of Antiquity St. Paul's Cathedral Of Cupolas State of Architecture in Eng- land compared ivith that of Italy The Palace qf the Doge. a Every one who attempts to describe Italy, must necessarily speak of the magnificence of its buildings, and, par consequence, of the beauty of its paintings, its sculpture, and its architec ture. Those travellers, therefore, who slur over their account of the arts, which adorn and beautify at every step that classic ground, ought at once to confess their incompetency for the task, rather than plead as their excuse the \" fine descriptions\" which have already ' been published to the world by former visitors. These"], [189, "149 VENICE. descriptions may possibly be \" fine :\" but, for my part, I must ingenuously confess, that I have hitherto seen no luminous account, either of the paintings, the sculpture, or the architecture of Italy, from the pen of a veritable homme de lettres. Certain artists, possessing very clear ideas, are often incapable of committing those ideas to paper. And if, in the course of the observations I am about to make, some great names should be subjected to a scrutiny, which may appear to detract from a celebrity of many centuries' standing, I can only say, that, in the task I have undertaken, my only aim has been, faithfully to impress upon the minds of others, those sentiments which are deeply engraven on my own. To begin with architecture. The first habi tations for man must, like the dens of wild beasts, or the nests of birds, have been intended to serve for shelter from the wet, the cold, the wind, and from intense heat ; as well as to guard against wolves, tigers, and other savage animals during the night. Let us imagine three or four trees growing close to each other : they might soon be formed into an enclosure, trian gular or square, by means of sheets of basket or wicker-work, made of the boughs of the said trees. A roof or canopy would follow, con- l S"], [190, "150 VENICE. structed likewise of the produce of the forest, always adhering to the gifts of Providence ; and, accordingly, the covering afforded by the oak and other trees would suggest the invention of different shapes, for a lid or dome to the new edifice, to preserve the area from becoming a swamp. The annual plumations of the feathery tribe, and the wool and hair of quadrupeds collected together, would be sufficient to insure a comfortable retreat to man in his savage state. When his views began to expand, he would then turn his thoughts towards the erection of some nobler fabric \u2014 a temple, perchance, for the worship of his God, or a dwelling for his chieftain. Ornaments, of a higher nature than any hitherto attempted would then be set about ; and, step by step, the art would insen sibly improve. In the best era of architecture, security against the perils incidental to the convulsions of nature, whether by tempest or earthquake, was the primary object. Symmetry and orna ment followed next in the train. In the first ages of society, temples were sought after by the people, as places of refuge in moments of peril, whether arising from war, from contagious diseases, or from the howling of the storm. And, in accordance with this principle, we trace"], [191, "151 VENICE. in the Egyptian, Assyrian, and other remains of the most remote antiquity, the features I have here traced. Trees were felled, and a portion of the trunks were fixed into the earth. They were thus arranged at equal distances, and upon their summits, coequal in height, and flat, were placed other masses of wood, made square, form- ing the architrave. That a pillar or column, tapering as it ascends, was fashioned originally from the shape of the shaft or body of a tree, is a position which, I believe, no one will be inclined to dispute. It is fluted or plain, fo- liated, and indented, obliquely or otherwise, according to the taste of the workman but, rotundity was always its leading form : to deviate therefrom was to shock and disgust ; and it upholds those parts which project, such as vestibules, corridors, and passages for the people. The capital swells. So with trees : at the place where the main arms branch out from the trunk, the same would be found to be the case if a recision were made immediately over the said juncture\u2014 a triforked appearance, suffi- cient to justify the architect in transferring the practice from wood to more durable marble, by tumifying the pillar at the head or top. And, in giving to the plinth, or base, a rib, he is justi fied by a reference to the root of the tree, when l 4"], [192, "152 VENICE. cleared of its ruggedness, and made smooth like a ring or hoop. The Grecians appear to have established their theories respecting the column, upon this prin ciple of nature; which principle, however, might long, very long before, have been in use by other nations. The Egyptians adopted a trunk in its original state, with scarcely any pedestal, the root of the tree being embosomed in the earth : a style of column which is eminently strong and lasting. The ornaments at the capital are light and playful, adhering in this also to nature : for there the leaves commence, and there would very probably remain a few sprays and some foliage at the summit of the trunk ; a circumstance which, I have no doubt, gave rise to the carvings, which have subsequently been diversified, so as to include the plants or flowers growing in the vicinity, varied and modified according to the taste of the builder. Again, if we take the appearance of a forest, the natural resort of certain animals in quest of food and repose, we find the lower branches in a perfectly horizontal position. A hint this, by which the early architects appear to have pro fited ; their buildings having the appearance of so many groves : a repetition of the letter T., with at each end an I. And that this method"], [193, "153 VENICE. of building is best calculated for duration we readily discover, from the vetust remains still standing in the plains of Asia and Africa. Cities acquire new names from the political caprice of the conqueror, or from some ridicu lous lingual innovation. That Zenobia may have been a sovereign in the possession of some power, I am not disposed to deny ; but as to that queen having been the founder of Palmyra, I cannot listen to the absurd conjecture : not that I entirely reject the accounts, which award her the merit of augmenting the splendour of that city. At what period Persepolis was built, and by what people, are facts of which we are entirely ignorant. The Egyptian column is never, in the smallest degree, contracted at the base, like those of Greece, of Rome, and of modern Europe. The number of ages which have elapsed since the construction of some of the massy edifices to be found in that country, might probably have been guessed at, if, five hundred years ago, some petrific standard, exposed to the atmosphere, had been agreed upon, similar to the one adopted in the case of decayed monuments. From the results in the former instance, the pitch of remoteness might, with some degree of accuracy, have been guessed at, with respect to"], [194, "154 VENICE. the latter; about which such innumerable theories have been put forth, and all of them equally unworthy of credit. Neither vault, nor arch, nor dome, was admitted into their struc tures. The circle was to be found no where, but in the prop or pillar, and in their hierogly phics. The western front of St. Paul's Cathedral in London, is most unquestionably splendid, and, according to my taste, nearly perfect. The pillars which are seen supporting the dome are, however, inadmissible upon any established principle ; unless we may consider them to be trees rooted midway up the mountain, and that cavities in the rocksw ere the primitive asylums osman. Of cupolas \u2014 and I have seen every one worth looking at \u2014 that of the cathedral of which I have last been speaking is, to my taste, the most beautiful. The crying blunder however is, that the arched windows are made subordinate to the square ones ; that airy lightness is placed beneath rectangular stability : for thus the prin- ciple of strength is violated. To range insu lated columns, in situations where trunks of trees can by no possibility be made to grow, is an anomaly in architecture. Therefore the stout plank, or split pillar, with its foliated"], [195, "155 VENICE. capital should, as it appears to me, be exclu sively appropriated to second or third tiers or stories ; the curves to keep increasing even up to the circle, as the building ascends. And here again we have authority. The luminous orbs of heaven meet the sight when the eye looks up : and therefore, in architecture, ought the arch, the oval, and the sphere to find their sta tions aloft. The temple of Minerva at Athens, and other early magnificent erections, put the spectator in remembrance of a grove ; a horizon tal line is described by the termination ofthe leaves, while the bodies of the trees are the columns. In England, the science of architecture is amazingly confined. The houses of private individuals are as painfully similar to each other, as if an immutable decree had regulated their figure and dimensions. A few lordly habitations are indeed exempt from this peculiarity : but, as for a noble, stately, hospitable-looking stair- case, it is so rare a thing, that the owner of the mansion seems to have had no very strong in- clination that any of his guests should, undi- rected, find their way through, or even into, the premises. In very few houses can the stairs be readily found. But the spirit for society in this country is very limited ; and, to say the truth, not without reason ; if we are to credit"], [196, "156 VENICE. the reports, as to the demoralized state of the mass of the population. Be this as it may, a secluded, domestic life is, after all, in times like the present, undoubtedly the best. But \u2014 do our English males, of the higher and the lower classes, live much in the bosoms of their fami lies ? I confess I should pause, before I ven tured to answer in the affirmative. On the contrary, in Italy, a noble staircase, and stately and spacious saloons, were indispen sable features in the palace of every patrician \u2014 at least it was so in Venice ; and this for pretty obvious reasons. The entire aristocracy amount ed to about nine hundred or a thousand families ; and, as they all became equal, from the moment their title deeds were enrolled in the Libro d'Oro, and were all liable to be appointed to high situations, it was imperative on each of them, when so appointed, to send round invita tions to the rest. No private grudge was ever suffered to interfere with this politic measure. There was no limitation or exemption \u2014 nothing paltry, nor personally offensive, nor invidious. And thus was this noble body, by frequent meetings and collisions of this sort, not only made cheerful by entertainments and diversions, but cemented more closely together by the cap tivating smiles of urbanity, and the pleasures of"], [197, "VENICE. 157 the banquet. The married ladies were always invited, but le nubili never. To accommo date so numerous an assembly, it was therefore necessary that the saloons should be spacious. Even on the upper stories it was usual to fit up capacious apartments. The entertainments at Venice consisted neither of a dinner nor supper. There was a cold collation, a sort of dejeUne d lafourchette, con sisting of every delicacy and rarity ; as those who were in affluent circumstances spared no expense upon these public occasions, either in the way of parade or of luxury. The magnificent palace of the Doge, in the Piazza di San Marco, is raised upon pillars ; but the design having been considered too bold, from the number of vaults or arches, the ground about was raised, so as to encroach somewhat on the building, thereby sinking it a trifle, and the centre ones were filled up. At first, how ever, this wonderful edifice stood upon columns, having the appearance of a forest of trees."], [198, "158 CHAPTER XVII. VENICE. Some ofthe magnificent Edifices at Venice described The Basilica, or Church of San Marco The Four Brazen Steeds of Lysippus A few Words on the Hyde Park Achilles Saint Mark's Square The Campanile The Procuratia The Public Library The Ducal Palace The Italians particularly fond of Pictures A few Words of Advice to the Quakers and other Contemners of the Fine Arts A Comparison between the Society of Friends and the Sons of Israel. I shall now offer a few words on some of the most magnificent edifices to be seen in this most singular and beautiful city. The Basilica, or church of San Marco, was begun in the year 977\u00bb and finished, in the superb style in which we now behold it, in 1071. It has ten outer gates of Corinthian brass, be sides five more within, of the same material, all richly ornamented ; and between them there is a gallery, or piazza, for the people to prome nade in. Roofs, walls, pavement \u2014 the whole of the interior of this stupendous temple, is inlaid with mosaics, in gold and colours, or adorned with"], [199, "159 VENICE. the finest marbles. On entering, and lifting our eyes towards the dome, we at once be hold so immense a number of paintings, of the description here mentioned, in the different ceilings, curves, arches, and niches, that it would be impossible to give a sketch of them ; each however is accompanied with an explana tory description. The first artists have all been employed in embellishing its walls. Tintoretto's cartoons have principally served to direct the artificers of these splendid mosaics ; but many of them are from designs of a much earlier date. Amidst a multitude of other pillars, all carved out of precious materials, and many of them brought from Constantinople when the Venetians con quered that city, are eight columns of a serpen tine shape, carried originally from Jerusalem, and which are said to have adorned the famous temple of Solomon. Both within and without, are to be seen beautiful pillars, of every kind of rare marble, magnificently piled and arranged, though rather according to the Saracenic taste. Upon the corridor, surmounting the archi trave in front, are placed the famous four steeds, in Corinthian brass, of unparalleled merit. The action of the gentle trot has been caught by the artist, and every muscle of these"], [200, "160 VENICE. noble creatures has been displayed with such prodigious felicity, that if their golden sur faces could be converted into the silky gloss of nature, the animals might be supposed to move. They are generally believed to be the work manship of the celebrated Lysippus, the Greek sculptor, and they certainly leave all modern attempts at equestrian statues at an immeasur able distance. As I have spoken of one much talked of pub lic ornament, perhaps I shall be excused if I briefly advert to another. I mean the magnificent bronze figure recently erected in Hyde-Park, and given out tobe that of Achilles. But, for what reason that personage, who is no where repre sented by Homer as being fond of retiring, should be considered to be pourtrayed in the statue in question, I think it would be difficult to imagine. On Monte Cavallo, at Rome, where the original is still standing, this noble figure is represented as managing a fiery steed ; thereby intending to intimate the power of intelligence in man, over brute matter, and even over his own appetites \u2014 in short, an emblem denoting the superiority of mind over body. Certain persons have, I know, an inexpressible aversion to the figure, and are for having it taken away altogether. Thank God, I am not"], [201, "161 VENICE. formed in so fastidious a mould. I would, how ever, recommend to our arbiters of taste the immediate removal of the shield, and the intro duction of the animal ; as the unaccountable anomaly which now presents itself would then be done away with. The figure actually appears to be recoiling, and drawing itself away from some portentous emanation from above ; where as, its attitude and the expression of its counte nance accord admirably with the rearing up of the animal. Moreover, both hands are suited to the action of holding a bridle. In short, it cannot be Achilles ; for neither hand is seen wielding a weapon. If he be sup posed to be fighting with men, a figure of such colossal magnitude would not be looking up wards. If he be warring with the gods, then adieu, Master Hyde-park Achilles ! You cannot be Homer's hero ; for he was \" the beloved of Jove\"\u2014 \" And, to the Gods resign 'd, To reason gave the empire of his mind.\" The Piazza di San Marco is a vast area, com prizing the most splendid, or at least the richest, piles of architecture in the universe. It is about as large as Lincoln's- Inn-Fields ; but, VOL. I. M"], [202, "162 VENICE. heavens, how different ! It has, in part, been faintly, very faintly, imitated in the Palais Royal at Paris. Near to the church, the Cam panile, or steeple, three hundred and thirty feet in height, surmounted by an angel in bronze, rears its stupendous head, and stands alone. At the top of this tower was the immortal Galileo, of whom I shall speak more at large hereafter, wont to make his observations on the heavenly bodies. Within a few feet from the Campanile, say thirty or forty, the noble pile of buildings called the Procuratia, together with the public Library, display their glories at right angles. The latter is a building of unmatchable elegance and costliness, adorned with statues, executed by the mighty Sansovino, which, in no other edifice in the world, have I seen equalled in point of merit, and much less so in quantity. Arabesque foliage, heads of lions, men, women, children \u2014 entire statues of heroes, gods, and females ; some with drapery, others inpuris naturalibus \u2014 models of the choic est kind of decoration, disposed with judgment, and bestowed with the magnanimous liberality worthy of a great, and liberal, and wealthy people. Such are the objects, all in marble, and finished with the hand of a master, which grace the Library at Venice."], [203, "163 VENICE. Some critics, springing from the tribe of eco nomists, have been very severe with the square of St. Mark, and have ventured to pronounce the style of the buildings too exuberant ; but, as a poor man once said to a painter, who was complaining that his works were undervalued \u2014 \" it would be a rare performance indeed, if no fault were found with it \" \u2014 the same may be said of this noble Piazza. Fronting the Library, at the distance of about a hundred and fifty feet, one side of the Ducal Palace presents itself, the facade of which overlooks the sea. It is an immense building, originally supported by a crowd of pillars, re sembling a forest of huge trees, entirely com posed of marble. But the ultramontane be holder, accustomed to the sight of bricks in his own country, cannot readily bring himself to credit the simple fact, that the chequered walls of this incomparable building are not of brick, but are actually squares of red and white mar ble : the former of which was brought from Verona, and has a good deal the colour of burnt clay. The court of this palace is extremely fine, especially two of its sides, which are highly deco rated with sculptured marble from top to bottom ; aided by the famous Giant's stairs, which are m2"], [204, "164 VENICE. formed of, and inlaid with, fine stones ; together with a multitude of statues, chiselled by the most eminent workmen, many of them being antiques. By the bye, it appears to me not a little extra ordinary, that, in the present rage for church building in England, scarcely any decorations of the richer kind are to be discovered ; and, of the ornate style, none ; unless a few flourishes of leaves, and flowers, and composi tions drawn from inanimate nature, may be classed under that head. A few meagre basso relievos, it is true, have been added, as well as a sprinkling of statues ; but, generally speaking, these shabby decorations are beneath medio crity, and more especially the detached statues. The above-mentioned splendid edifice has no fewer than five and thirty arches ; namely, seventeen on the side looking towards the Li brary, and eighteen on the side facing the sea, each of them being ten feet wide. The dia meter of the shafts which support this vast pile may be guessed at, from the extent of both sides, which is four hundred and five feet. Both the outer and inner porticos serve for the re creation, as well as shelter of the people. A variety of staircases open into the interior, all of them spacious, and some of them orna-"], [205, "165 VENICE. mented with elaborate paintings of extraordinary merit, in the manner of galleries \u2014 a style of decoration common in public, as well as private edifices. Indeed, the Italians generally are uncommonly fond of pictures ; and for that reason do I consider them as surpassing the rest of the world, in their admiration of the beauties of nature. And, indeed, are we not all, more or less, painters ? What is the organ of sight but a window for pictures ? And of consequence, a human being is an iconoclist (if I may be permitted to use the expression) from his very cradle ; unless he happen to be born blind. Vision, or the faculty of sight, is assuredly the foremost of the senses : and, that the first- rate painters have the best sight, no one will pretend to deny. Let the principle be even applied intellectually, and probably it will bear the most scrupulous examination. \" Where there is no vision, the people perish,\" is the language of Scripture : and sublime language it is, implying, that the loss of sight, materially or spiritually, is tantamount to jeopardy and ruin. What have the Quakers, and other contemners ofthe elegant arts, to say to my position ? Although m 3"], [206, "166 VENICE. I despise no trade, nor find fault with nature for furnishing us with the means of making bread, yet would not I be ranked with those dullards, who cry down painting, and underrate the orna mental dispensations of Heaven. When God, in his wisdom, shall contract his hand, and send forth fruit without blossom, or bestow the blessing of eye-sight for the low purposes of appetite \u2014 when the soul shall become warped and neutralized \u2014 then, but .not till then, will certain notions appear less ridiculous, and less objectionable, than they now do. The Quakers, in some respects, resemble the Jews ; in other respects, they differ widely from that people. The Quakers are proudly prim and particular about their garments : the Jews are much given to filth and finery. The Quakers wear habits of the choicest fabric, and the most delicate texture : the Jews, on the contrary, adopt feathers and all sorts of trinkets and taw dry. The sons of Israel are airy and volatile ; while the disciples of George Fox affect a stiff, and blunt, and demure, and rigid deportment. Both Quaker and Jew, however, are studious of accumulating vast wealth. Individually, the Hebrew, in this respect, outstrips the yea-and nay Friend, and all other denominations. A"], [207, "167 VENICE. small number of them mystify and bewilder the rest of the world. But, as a tribe, advancing in a phalanx, the Quakers threaten the whole fabric of society with subjugation \u2014 through the medium of gold. They borrow of no man : neither do they lend readily. On this head, however, I am not positively instructed. At any rate, it is well understood, that they chiefly expend their money amongst those of their own religious profession ; though they will sell freely to strangers. To players, musicians, and profane dancers, they never give a farthing in any shape ; though they will cordially receive the coin of these same players, and musicians, and profane dancers, at their shops. Peradventure they may allege, that though they take the cash, they give wares in return. True : but the profits ! my honest Aminadab \u2014what be- comes of the profits ? It is, therefore, obvious, that, at this rate, as far as actual calculation warrants us in coming to a conclusion, the Quakers, in the course of time, must outstrip all the rest of mankind in point of riches ; and, as long as money bags shall bear the sway, few of us can doubt what sort of Jerusalem those people are looking forward to ! Upon the whole, therefore, the Jews>>\u2014 who, occasionally, are friends to the fine arts \u2014 are, perhaps, as a m 4"], [208, "168 VENICE body, less cunning and politic than the Quakers. Now, so far from painting having a tendency to accelerate the subversion of kingdoms, I be lieve the direct contrary to be the fact. Rome at this moment beholds, in that beautiful art, a stay, a prop \u2014 a child imbued with true filial piety, shedding the balm of comfort over the mind, and administering to the wants of that parent of monarchies, in this her decrepitude. Foreigners who repair to Italy, hie constantly to Rome, and protract their stay in that city, that they may become acquainted with the gra phic jewels it contains ; thereby contributing to the support of thousands. With similar views, and with like advantages to the natives, are many other parts of the world visited by travellers. What I have here urged with regard to painting, applies also to sculp ture and architecture ; and shews that they may be considered profitable, even in the eyes ofthe political economist. But, their higher and more noble purpose is, the improvement of the mind, and the sublimation of the intellect.

To enumerate the paintings which are to be seen at Venice, nearly all of them super-excel lent, and to point out their respective beauties, would be a task far beyond the design which I at first proposed to myself ; namely, that of merely giving a rapid sketch of what I had beheld, interspersed with such observations and"], [210, "170 VENICE. reflections as were naturally suggested to my mind, by the topics under examination. For the present, I shall advert to the city of Venice itself; which may be said to rest neither on earth, nor water, nor sky, and which seems the work of divine, rather than of human agency. It is impregnable, though unprotected by fortresses. As Martinelli observes, its boun daries and commencement cannot be traced ; neither can its termination be ascertained. Most plentifully supplied, on every side, with whatever is necessary for the use of man, the liberal and mechanical arts were cherished ; and commerce was seen flourishing. Men of genius and of talent, in every art and science, were brought forward and rewarded, without pa rade or ostentation. Grandeur, devoid of glarish \u00bb frivolity, was every where visible. The costume ofthe nobles was sober, yet rich, and calculated to attract respect from their inferiors. The dress of all classes ofthe people was consistent with the simplicity and decency of good sense and of genuine religion. Liberty and tranquillity were every where enjoyed, while prepotency found an instant corrective in wise laws, speedily administered by impartial and upright men, and enforced in behalf of the poor as well as of the rich. Illustrious, too, by the felicity of her un-"], [211, "171 VENICE. dertakings, and the respect in which the repub lic of Venice was held by every other state, her victories rendered her the admiration ofthe rest of the world, and respected for her maritime power, as well as her terrestrial dominion \u2014 alike feared by land, and formidable on the ocean. Her government combined profound policy with genuine Christianity, and remained uncon taminated, amidst a profuse waste of treasure and of blood, in wars carried on for the defence of religion. The multiplicity of churches, hos pitals, chapels, and other holy places, which were built and endowed, not only decently, but sumptuously, together with the manifold acts of charity offered up to the Deity, and to the afflicted amongst mankind, justify the claim or Venice to the title of the sanctuary of Re ligion, and the abode of Christian piety and genuine benevolence. This city, as I have already observed, may be said to rest neither on earth, nor water, nor sky. Not on sky ; because, although elevated above the ground her splendid edifices tower aloft, they are nevertheless the abode of mortals. Not on earth ; since, out of this, the Almighty has ordained that there should grow fruits and herbs, and not lofty and stupendous palaces, temples, and noble mansions. And, for the"], [212, "172 VENICE. same reason, perceiving those majestic eleva tions in masonry soaring to the clouds, it cannot be water. Therefore I know not whether this place should be called immoveable water, or unsteady land ; terrestrial sky, or aerial earth. This renowned city may be said to have no foundation ; the substratum being neither rock, nor sand, nor solid earth ; but mere mud, which yields to the pressure of the foot, yet never theless sustains this wondrous pile of buildings ; reminding one of the language of the royal Psalmist, when speaking of the Supreme Archi tect of the Universe, \" quifirmavit terram super aquas,\" with regard to his power in forming the universe. For truly the immortal and eternal Spirit could alone have stirred up mortality to raise a work of this kind, to become, as it were, a city of refuge for the righteous, and a sanc tuary for the followers of the true faith, amidst clouds of barbarism, and a wilderness of the most furious persecutions ! Behold a city, strong without fortifications ! For no walls encircle her ; nor are there towers or battlements for purposes of war. Neither are there gates, or highways, or other fixed passages, for egress and regress. But, both by day and by night, around and throughout, this fa mous city is open and unguarded. Nevertheless,"], [213, "173 VENICE. under Heaven, it possessed not only the means of defence for her own inhabitants, but for the protection of those of the other cities, who re posed under the safeguard of her invincible Lion. Her beginning is unknown ; since there exists no memorial of the arrival of her first citizens. And although historians date her commence ment from the 25th of March, a.d. 421 ; which happened to be the time of laying the founda tion of Saint James of Rialto, her first church (supposing it to be the first), and which, for those days,was of extraordinary magnificence ; \u2014 it is impossible that that should have been the period ; inasmuch as a church is ever pre ceded by other habitations, especially in the midst of swamps and water. In fact, it is known that, previous to the year 400, people resided there ; for then it was that the Gepids and Goths ravaged all Italy, and forced numerous opulent and noble families to repair for safety to the Venetian Lagunes, among the people there settled. In consequence of this emigration, from a state of actual poverty and destitution, the city thenceforward grew and spread with the strides of a giant. Besides the sublime square of St. Mark, there are at Venice hundreds of noble palaces and stately buildings. Indeed, according to Sanso-"], [214, "174 VENICE. vino, in no city of Europe are there so many sumptuous habitations, of equal grandeur in point of architecture, so completely adapted for comfort and convenience. And to this I may add, without exaggeration, that within a circuit of six miles, the boundaries of this me tropolis, the dwellings, as well as the popula tion, are more numerous than in any other city of twice its magnitude. The vast number of wells which furnish the inhabitants, though surrounded by the sea, with an excellent supply of fresh water, de serves notice ; as well as the convenience of proceeding to and fro by boat, and of thereby conveying, by the labour of one man, as many goods as would require ten waggons to forward by land. Canals are seen winding in every direction, dividing the city into seventy-two islands, though never hindering those who prefer walking from going by land, by means of her numerous bridges. In short, when we behold a city of such magnitude, built upon piles in the midst of the sea, so well supplied with every thing that the heart of man can desire, from the necessary up to the luxury of life, we are forced to acknow ledge, that it is scarcely possible that the in genuity of man should be carried farther."], [215, "VENICE. 175 As a nation, the Venetians are perhaps the most polite in the world ; and that from circum stances peculiar to their city : for as there are no carriages nor horses, all ranks and classes of society are compelled to go a good deal on foot, and consequently come much in contact with each other ; so that the morgue aristocratique, which one sees so much of at Paris or London, never annoys the pedestrian. Even the gondolas, or marine palanquins, were so plain, that the people neither felt themselves offended or hu miliated at the sight of them ; for the nobles, in the time of the Republic, were restrained by law from extravagance in their equipages. Venice might formerly be called the city of peace. Every thing in it was quiet and tranquil. The suavity of the Venetian manners resembled the softness of their climate. With singular propriety, the Doge was saluted by the title of \" the most serene prince.\" The arts of peace flourished amongst them with amazing splen dour. The mine was of a richness scarcely conceivable. In the single branch of painting, a vein was discovered, which, in the course of time, found its way into every palace and great mansion throughout Europe. The noble-minded Venetians were sensible that a true painter, instructed by nature to view"], [216, "176 VENICE. things correctly, and to represent them with fidelity, must, by her immutable laws, be in capable of speaking falsehoods, or of resorting to servile flattery. Rather, therefore, than lose the advantages to be derived from the posses sion of their vivid and animated productions, they knew how to smile benignly over any of those rash and impolitic slips, which, in other countries, were wont to draw down upon the artist the indignation and vengeance of those in authority. A striking instance this, of the su perior wisdom of the Venetian legislature ! For who amongst us would expect, that the brilliant Tintoretto, who pervaded the heavens of truth more like a god than a mortal, should be an obsequious sycophant, a fawning spaniel, a toad, tongue-bound, venomous and vile ? I answer \u2014 no one possessing the least portion of discern ment. It is not at all surprising, that so few good paintings are to be met with in countries, the potentates of which are enveloped in clouds of ignorance, and surrounded by swarms of fulsome adulators. It should ever be borne in mind by the'm, that \" flattery is evanescent, but works remain :\" \u2014 an aphorism, this, which at Venice I once heard levelled at Canova ; whose perfor mances, by the bye, bear few indications of real"], [217, "177 VENICE. genius ; especially such of them as are of the robust and vigorous kind. Greatly influenced and impressed by the innumerable elegant frag ments of antique art, which were constantly before his eyes, like many others (indeed, so many, that excepting Michael Angelo, and one or two besides, there is not an exception), he has pillaged from them in such an un merciful spirit of plagiarism, such parts of his statues as are not copies are feeble, and gla ringly inferior to the forms which he has bor. rowed from antiques, and regulated by their proportions. Of the truth of my assertion, any one will be convinced, by looking at his Venus and Adonis. The greatest care, there fore, should be taken, lest the fine models at Rome should impair, rather than brace and strengthen and invigorate the capacity of the young artist. The antique absolutely bewilders and stupifies many a tyro ; who, but for the imposing rhapsodies of a set of blustering bul lies in matters of taste, would have been a credit to himself and an honour to his country. Too much allured by the cold marble, they are apt to forsake the carnation of real life, and to fancy nothing strictly correct, that is not hard and marmorean. With all their occasional bad drawing, the Venetians are infinitely superior VOL. I. N"], [218, "178 VENICE. to the vile herd of artists of whom I have been speaking. To revert to what I have said in favour of the Venetians generally. Many a traveller will, I know, contradict me. Let, however, such persons bear in mind, that I have rather been speaking of what they once were, than of what they are now lowered down to, by a long course of misrule. Although I do not profess to be long to the race of ferrets, nor to descend too far into the cespools of infamy, I trust I shall never be backward in distinguishing vice from virtue. That some of the Venetians are noto rious cheats, few will deny ; for, in all countries, there are rogues without number. In England, strangers are not more especially singled out for sacrifice than the natives ; whereas, the lower classes of Italians, and the Venetians in par ticular, exult whenever a trick succeeds against an Englishman, or indeed any foresti6re. But, in what estimation, I ask, are foreigners held by the shopkeepers of England ? Is it not a constant practice with them to depreciate and run down every thing of foreign manufacture ; even when, in their hearts, they know the sneer to be unmerited ? Now, if this be not fraud of the foulest stamp, then am I ignorant what fraud means."], [219, "179 V E N I C E. Not that I would insinuate any thing dero gatory to the renown of my countrymen \u2014 a renown, however, which I fear they have de rived more from their golden, than their mental talents. Invention, genius, sublime flights \u2014 these are gems which are rarely to be found in English soil. Warped and circumscribed as her children are in matters appertaining to bril liant imagination, their several manufactures are ably wrought, neatly polished, and skilfully finished. On the other hand, the Venetians, though capable of erecting the most gorgeous edifices, will leave the very window-frames in so incomplete a state, that they will not ward off the weather. The truth is, that scarcely any articles but those of right down domestic utility are called for in England, whose people are a kind of Quakers or Methodists, with regard to the blandishments of existence ; while the more southern inhabitants of Europe, like the ritual they profess, delight in splendour and pageantry. Perhaps I shall be excused for observing in this place, by way of illustration, that the British legitimate character, in the sphere of intel ligence, bears along with it few portions of excursive imagery. It is neither copious in the lineaments of invention and originality, nor prolific in the charms of novelty, Milton, who N 2"], [220, "180 VENICE. was educated in Italy, and Shakespeare, with all his merit, borrowed freely from the Italians, both with regard to the subject, the thought, and the expression ; as well as most copiously from the Holy Scriptures. If Dante, Ariosto, and the Novellieri were carefully examined, to gether with the Bible, much of what those two English poets have written would not be found so very original, as many have hitherto ima gined them to be. Not that I would insinuate that Shakespeare, for energy of language, for depth of thought, and for aptness of similitude, is not, par excellence, the greatest of poets : but, as a reformer of morals and a queller of the tu multuous passions, little, I think, can be said in his praise. Revenge and murder, and war and havock, are demons by far too familiar with him. In didactic poetry, and in the science of moral philosophy, the English appear to me to have left the rest of the world far behind. For close metaphysical reasoning ; for geometry ; for calculations in matters of finance ; and for a knowledge of the arid sciences, of every de scription, connected with political economy, they bear away the palm. The very shopmen in England display instances of cool sagacity, which, though bottomed on sheer craft, are nevertheless admirable, and fully equal to the"], [221, "181 VENICE. astuzia of a member of the French corps diplo matique. But, what do I infer from all this ? It is the deed itself, and not the individual who performs it, that we ought to look at ; if we wish to arrive at an impartial judgment, and to imitate the final justice of heaven. Habits are not con clusive; though they certainly contribute much towards the formation of character. For instance, all merchants are not uniformly narrow-minded. Much of the staid sort of temper above spoken of is the offspring of certain pursuits. Com mercial and other men, travelling from any country to distant lands, bring back with them the secrets practised in business abroad, and those finesses and inventions cease, in the course of time, to be exotics ; until, at length, aug mented by constant accessions, excited by fresh luxuries, and stimulated by the furies of am bition, the more gentle elements of taste and elegant mental images take their departure ; unable to domiciliate with the coarse passions which a spirit for traffic engenders, and which spirit is invariably inimical to the effusions of true genius \u2014 that description of genius, I mean, which imparts the light of truth, as the showers of heaven mature the fruits of the earth. n 3"], [222, "182 Venice. As tempests are accompanied by rains, which may be beneficial to the fields, so, amidst the storms of the soul, are occasional flashes of the divine spirit elicited. But, such flashes are neither safe nor desirable ; since, the collision of particular bodies may produce fatal con sequences, if the emitted sparks should ac cidentally be carried amidst inflammable sub stances. From all which, it is to be inferred, that the happiest condition is the condition of peace \u2014 \u25a0 O beauteous Peace ! Sweet union of a state ! what else but thou Gives safety, strength, and glory to a people !**\" CHAPTER XIX. VENICE. A rapid Sketch ofthe Causes which led to tke Overthrow ofthe Venetian Republic Under the fatal Influence of Francesco Pesaro, the Republic, in evil hour, declare for an Unarmed Neutrality. At the commencement of the French revolu tion, the Marquess Antonio Govion Broglio Solari, a Venetian nobleman, having made the"], [223, "183 VENICE. tour of Switzerland, with the Danish ambas sador, Baron d'Eirben, returned by the way of Turin, for the purpose of claiming a consider able landed estate, belonging to the family of Solari ; who, at the time of the plague in Piedmont, had dispersed themselves in various parts of Italy and France. The above branch settled at Venice, a second at Loretto, and a third, which took the name of Broglio, in France : and all of them are still living. Before the above-mentioned claim could be established, it was necessary that the Marquess \u2022should be presented to the King ; without which, a sight of the public documents could not be obtained. The Marquess de Prie, and the Count Perrone were his securities. The King, regarding the family of Solari as aliens, and that of the Bevillacquas, who were in pos- session of the property, as his subjects, thought proper, for reasons of policy, to refuse the desired permission. But, to soften the disap- pointment, his Majesty offered to decorate the Marquess Solari with the order of the Cross of San Maurizio Lazzaro ; which the Marquess, in his turn, thought fit to refuse, unless his Ma jesty would accompany it with a commeride; as he was by no means ambitious, he said, of an empty title. N 4"], [224, "184 VENICE. Such are the distressing situations in which individuals are liable to be placed, who live under absolute and despotic princes, capriciously decid ing on the property and lives of their subjects, in despite of law, and justice, and equity ! On leaving the court, the Marquess Solari dined in company with the two noblemen above mentioned, who then filled the situations of Minister of State and Prime Minister, at the court of Turin. In the course of conversation, the Marquess de Prie said, \" My dear Solari, you are about to set off for Venice. If you are no longer a Piedmontese, you are, at any rate, an Italian. Bear in mind what I am about to say to you. Inform the government, of which you are a member, that if we do not agree to enter into an Italian League, we shall all be buried in the common ruin of our country, from the meditated invasion of these modern Goths and Vandals ; for they are actually an army of Attilas. The Venetian Republic is the best populated, the richest, and the most beloved government in all Italy. Sixty thousand men would be more easily raised by it, than forty thousand would be in Piedmont.\" \" Yes,\" continued the Marquess Perrone, \" on the wisdom of the Venetian Senate, and on its future measures, I assert, and am ready"], [225, "185 VENICE. to maintain, that all Italy will be indebted either for its salvation or overthrow7. Remember, my dear Solari, I am an old practitioner in the policy of states !\" After having completed a mission, with which he had been charged from his own government to that of Milan, Solari returned to Venice, and faithfully reported what had passed be tween him and the ministers of the court of Turin. Indeed, dispatches to the same effect had preceded him, in which a reference was made to the verbal communication. He was accordingly called upon officially ; and being sincerely attached to his country, he expressed his honest sentiments, with all that ardour and animation which became a free-born subject. Whereupon, Antonio Zen, one of the Consiglio di Died said, smilingly, \" My dear Solari, I admire and appreciate the warmth of your patriotism ; but you must excuse me for saying, that you are viewing objects from the wrong end of the microscope.\" Zaccaria Valleroso, one of the Inquisitori di Stato, being one evening in company, at Venice, with a lady who had been an attachee to the court of France, at the breaking out of the revolution, and had escaped from its horrors, and of whom Madame Campan has spoken in"], [226, "186 VENICE. her Memoirs, though she has not named her\u2014 the lady happened to say, that she thought of retiring to the north of Europe. \" Why, Ma dame,\" said Valleroso, \" surely you are not afraid of the French army coming to Venice ?\" \" I beg your pardon, sir,\" replied the lady ; \" I think I am sufficiently well acquainted with the French to venture to assert, that if the Venetians do not prevent them from passing the Alps, the territory of the Republic will be no more respected than any other part of Italy ; the whole of which will be overrun, when once they have entered Savoy.\" \" Ah ! Madame,\" said Valleroso, \" these are sentiments unbecoming the mouth of a young female. The wisdom of the policy which we have uniformly adopted, will ever preserve us from the suspicion of partiality, by either of the contending parties.\" \" Have you a couple of hundred thousand men,\" rejoined the lady, \" ready to back your neutrality? If you have not, I cannot help fearing \u2014 forgive my womanish alarms \u2014 that your condition will be similar to that of those individuals, who are placed * between two stools.' \" The Grand Inquisitor, who seemed to think my suspicions unbottomed, and that I was fun-"], [227, "187 VENICE. damentally in error, smiled ; and, shaking his head, sententiously replied, \" Deem me not guilty of a breach of politeness when I tell you, Madam, that prophecy and prognostication are now-a-days out of vogue.\" The lady, however, \u2014 whom my readers will, by this time, surmise to have been their humble servant\u2014 instead of making her intended journey to the north, continued to reside in the south ; and having married a Venetian gentleman, she had frequent opportunities of being in the society of this unbelieving Jew of an Inquisitor ; but, never did she venture to touch upon the subject of her prophecy, until the French had actually taken possession of Venice ; when, in the pre sence of several persons of distinction, who had been witnesses to the former conversation, she said, \" Well, Cavalier Valleroso, will you now tell me, that my prophecies and prognostica tions were unbecoming the mouth of a young female ?\" Valleroso was so much affected, that he could give no answer ; and ever after he quitted the company, when chance happened to bring them together. Justice, however, demands that I should give my readers a trait in the character of this man, which does honour to his memory. Having been applied to, both by the French"], [228, "188 VENICE. and the Austrians, to accept a situation under their respective Governments, he unhesitatingly refused. His answer was \u2014 \"No; for nearly the whole of my life I have been a sovereign. I will not end my days in servitude.\" Though by no means rich, he was almost the only patrician of Venice, who conducted himself thus nobly and independently. The above-mentioned despatch from Turin, together with the accounts from France, the meeting ofthe ministers at Pilnitz, and the Duke of Brunswick's manifesto, induced at last the Venetian Republic to come to a definitive decision ; when, after many very long debates, it was determined, through the powerful in fluence of Francesco Pesaro, well known to have been the partizan of Austria, that the Republic should declare for an unarmed neu trality \u2014 a word unknown in the political vocabu lary, and only fitted to proceed from the mouth of the feeble-minded creature by whom it was uttered. The Venetian Senate, which, from its wise regulations, had never had occasion, since the formidable conspiracy ofthe Marquess de Bed mar, in the year 1618, even to suspect internal commotion, were now so overawed by the nu merous false reports spread by interested emis-"], [229, "189 VENICE. saries, that they no longer considered them selves safe in holding their public deliberations in the Ducal Palace, and therefore changed their place of meeting every evening, from one private palace to another. The night before they abdicated the Government, that wretched imbecile, the Doge, Manin, was heard to say, at the conversazione of the Senator Damula, \" I am sorry for those poor creatures who will be deprived of their bread by this misfortune ; but as for us, we shall all be as well off as ever !\" O ! had there been but a Dandolo, a Foscari, a Tron, or any other man of spirit among the Senators, the white livered cowardly Doge would have lost his head for his pusillanimity \u2014 the seat of government would have been changed as it formerly had been, to one of the Grecian Islands, and the Government would never have consented to have made so miserable, so dis graceful an exit ! To give my readers a correct notion of the extent of the treachery and corruption that pre vailed, and of the degeneracy of some of the leading members of the Senate, I will here introduce some striking facts. The Cavalier Condolmier, the High Admiral, who had the command of a fleet of observa-"], [230, "190 VENICE. tion, consisting of small vessels, to protect the entrance of the Lagunes, and who had, for some months, been detained at the mouth of the Adriatic, one day took it into his head to invite the Government and the public, to be present at a grand naval man\u0153uvre of all the ships in the harbour under his command. The day at length arrived; when Venice, and the whole Terra Firma, would have proved a rich field for the active exertions of our nimble fingered gen try of London ; since nearly all the inhabitants had quitted their houses, in order to be present at the wonderful exploits of this Nelson of the Venetian Lagunes. The roads from Treviso, Padua, and along the banks ofthe Brenta, were thronged with travellers, on foot and on horse back, in carriages and in carts. The lakes were covered with gondolas, peotti, open boats, burchielli, barges from Padua, gallere, &c. &c. &c. When the Rear Admiral shewed himself in his full uniform, scraping and bowing to the anxious spectators, as a mountebank does while selling his vile nostrums, he commenced the farce, by ordering the signals to be given. This was accordingly done ; but every one of them remained unanswered. Up and down ran boys and men, from one mast and shrowd to another ;"], [231, "191 VENICE. but all to no purpose. An apology was made, and the ill success was attributed to want of practice. The Admiral then made signals to another vessel, but with the like success. After firing and making tokens for more than an hour, like men shooting at dead fish, and after ex hausting speaking trumpets, tearing sails, and casting anchors ; after having, in short, failed both to right and left, the poor Admiral was assailed in front, by all those who were disap pointed. Night, however, coming to his assis tance, the charlatan contrived to make his escape, in a whole skin : and thus ended this me morable day, as it had commenced \u2014 in smoke ! Such were the valorous saviours of their country, who remained to protect the Lagunes, and to hail all persons who passed their vessels, whether coming to, or going from Venice ! When the fatal day at length arrived, and the revolution had actually taken place, most ofthe respectable inhabitants fled to the Terra Firma, from the plunder and confusion that were its inevitable consequences ; but which, to say the truth, was nothing, in comparison with what it might have been, and what it actually had been, in every other place, on similar distressing occasions."], [232, "192 VENICE. The sailors in these guard ships were from Dalmatia, commonly called Sclavonians, and active votaries to the nimble-fingered Mercury. Fortunate was it for Venice, that these fellows were, at the time, absent from the city. A gondola that happened to be passing, was boarded by them, and asked, \" What was going on at Venice ?\" \" Oh, horrible !\" answered some of the passengers ; \" they are robbing and plundering the houses in all directions.\" \" Jesu Maria, have mercy upon us!\" exclaimed these honest Sclavonian tars, \" let us go in stantly, and get a watch or two a-piece, and a little plate and linen, to take home to our dear wives and children !\""], [233, "193 CHAPTER XX.

Proofs ofthe Determination of the Venetian Republic to main- tain a strict Neutrality Proposition made to it by the British Government General Acton proposes an Italian League Falsehood of Buonaparte's Charges against the Republic Conduct of Francesco Pesaro after the Sale of Venice to the Austrians Anecdotes ofthe great Francesco Foscari, Prince Kaunitz, and the Empress Maria Theresa .Ofthe Count de Vergennes and his impenetrable Cypher .And of Lewis the Sixteenth, and General La Fayettc. As a proof that the Venetian Republic had no intention whatever of taking any part against the French, it will be only necessary for me to state, that Lavizzari, when he was Venetian resi dent at the Court of Great Britain, sent to his government a proposition made by the British cabinet, offering a certain number of ships to protect the Venetian territories in the Adriatic, besides a considerable sum of money, wherewith to raise an additional number of auxiliaries, if necessary. This proffer the Republic thought fit to decline. The proposition was first made in the year 1793. It was afterwards twice re- VOL. i. o"], [234, "194 VENICE. peated, and as often rejected ; accompanied, however, with expressions of their liveliest grati tude for the interest which the British ministry had taken in the welfare and safety of the Republic. A copy of one of the documents containing this refusal, fell into the hands of the French Government ; by what means has not been ascer tained. It is, however, supposed to have had some influence on the conduct of Buonaparte towards the Republic ; from the certainty it afforded him, that he had nothing to fear from England, in consequence of any aggression he might think proper to commit. The said copy of the rejected proposition was shewn to the Venetian minister in Switzerland, in conse quence, as is supposed, of Pesaro's project of an unarmed neutrality. General Acton was then the minister of Naples. On the despatches to the British am bassador, Sir William Hamilton, containing the refusal of the Venetian Republic, being shown to him, though the general did not wish the King of Naples to take any share in the English system of naval armament about to be established in the Mediterranean, he nevertheless thought it highly necessary, that an Italian league should be entered into ; and, so sensibly was he affected"], [235, "195 VENICE. by the perusal of the above despatch, contain ing the determination of the Venetian senate, that he wrote an energetic memorial to the Republic, dissuading them from persisting in the fatal notion of remaining neutral ; and, above all things, of remaining unarmed. Nor would he even trust his despatch to Bus cinello, the Venetian ambassador, but sent a Neapolitan nobleman expressly to Venice, with a proposition for maintaining a line of guard ships, to be united with the Venetian, from Capo Passero to Corfu. The Grand Master of Malta also undertook to guard the line, from that island up to the Levant ; while Pope Pius the Sixth offered to assist the Venetians, by sea and land, with all the Italian powers ; and remon strated, in the strongest terms, against the im politic adoption, on their part, of an unarmed neutrality. But, all was of no avail. The Go vernment of Venice had taken its measures ; and was resolved not to swerve therefrom. With what face then, could Buonaparte accuse that Republic of treachery, in arming against the French, and adduce that treachery as a formal reason for violating the Venetian neutrality ; for inducing Bergamo and Brescia to revolt ; and for directing the horrible massacre o 2"], [236, "196 VENICE. at Verona, and effecting the overthrow of its Government? But all these existing documents are nothing, when compared to the mass of proofs which could be adduced, exonerating the Venetian Republic from every foul charge made against it, by the then commander of the army of Italy. Nay, Barras himself could have confuted the whole of Buonaparte's base accusations ; and the other four members of the Directory had very weighty reasons \u2014 reasons as big as a plum \u2014 for guaranteeing the independence of the Venetian States. No : they are indebted for all their distresses to the primitive sin of not keep ing up an army by sea and by land, which might act in conjunction with those of the above-mentioned powers, and thereby cause their neutrality to be respected. From all which, I think it is abundantly evident, that the ruin of Italy may with justice be attributed to that weak, as well as wicked senator, Francesco Pesaro ; whose influence, and whose notorious partiality for the Austrians, induced the Venetian Republic to depart from its antient system of an armed neutrality ; whereby, on all former occasions, it had caused itself to be respected. But, influenced by cor-"], [237, "197 VENICE. ruption\u2014 by ambition \u2014 by folly \u2014 and by per sonal interest, he compelled the senate to adopt a neutrality unarmed, and had the baseness to stigmatize all those who opposed him, as traitors and jacobins. Francesco Labbia was likewise in the interest of Austria, On the first reverses, however, of the Imperial army, whilst he was Podesta of Padua, he opened the gates of that city to the French. He was nevertheless rewarded with a German wife, and was favourably received at Vienna \u2014 in recompense for betraying the go vernment of his native country ! As soon as Venice had been sold by Buona parte to the Austrians, Francis Pesaro was dis patched by the latter government from Vienna, whither he had fled, to place the foreign yoke on the necks of his fellow- citizens ; those citi zens who, during the space of fourteen centu ries, had governed themselves, without suffering the humiliation of any foreign interference. The first act of Pesaro's authority, after his return to Venice, was the banishment of his only brother, Pietro Pesaro ; who, at this mo ment, resides, and has been residing ever since, in the outskirts of London, in a small mansion, not so large as one of the out-houses of his o 3"], [238, "198 VENICE. magnificent marble palace, on the grand canal at Venice. Francis Pesaro, and a few of his followers, equally ignorant as himself, and who had always been considered to be so by the major part of the senators, and especially by the great pater patri\u0153, Francesco Foscari, who generally made Pesaro the laughing-stock of the senate, when ever he attempted to open his mouth \u2014 being left, by their deaths, masters ofthe field of action, opposed the Republic in every thing that tended to its welfare ; but most especially in that one thing, so essential to its own dignity as an independent state, and to the salvation of all Italy \u2014 an armed neutrality. Having introduced the celebrated Frances Foscari to the notice of my reader, I shall, I am confident, be excused a short digression. It is unnecessary for me to inform him, that the winged lion of St. Mark was the antient arms ofthe Republic ; that saint having become the patron of Venice, ever since his remains were brought to that city from the Levant. Even the animal itself is so represented; holding be tween his claws the book of the laws of that evangelical saint, and distinguished from his brother lions by having a crown on his head,"], [239, "199 V EXIC E. and wings rising out of his shoulders ; which insignia were at the head of all the decrees and acts of the Republic. This circumstance gave rise to the witty reply of Foscari to Prince Kaunitz, the Austrian minister, on his asking one day, in the presence of the Empress Maria Theresa, at whose court Foscari then resided as the Venetian ambassador, \" where the Republic had found its winged lion ?\" \" In the same forest,\" replied Foscari, \" in which Austria dis covered her two-headed eagle.\" The beautiful Maria Theresa laughed heartily, not only at Foscari's answer, but at the effect it produced on Prince Kaunitz ; who, suddenly starting back, nearly knocked off his superb court wig, which it usually took him a couple of hours every morning to adjust to his satis faction. The answer given to the Austrian minister by the shrewd Venetian, recals to my recollec tion a singular trait in the character of Prince Kaunitz, shewing the uncommon attention which he paid to his dress, and especially to his peruke and his teeth ; the latter of which he would wash after dinner at table, in the presence of his guests. This eminent diplomatist, who had been the confidential minister of five suc cessive monarchs, had, like all other great men, o 4"], [240, "200 VENICE. his foibles ; thereby proving themselves to be mere mortals. For, throughout every scene of life, virtue and wisdom and talent' will be found opposed by vice and folly and presumption ; generosity and magnanimity by sordid avarice ; and sublimity of soul in theory, by deeds of littleness in practice. I venture the reflection after long personal experience. This same Prince Kaunitz was the most dis tinguished German dandy of his day, and was, as I have said, especially particular in the ar rangement of his wig. I had one morning an appointment with him on some business for a friend ; when his secretary told me he was sure the Prince had forgot the hour he had appointed, as it was the precise time which he devoted to his toilet, and that I should have to wait at least a couple of hours. While I was so waiting, this secretary related to me the following par ticulars. - It was the usual practice, he said, for the valet-de-chambre to dress the said wig on the Prince's head. As soon as the row upon row of curls had been diplomatically and skilfully arranged, the knight of the curling irons next emptied at least a pound of powder into his pouch, and, from an aperture in the door, made for the purpose, puffed it into an empty room."], [241, "201 V E N I C E. When the room was completely filled therewith, the Prince, with a mask on his face, entered it, and took a few stately turns backward and for ward, until every hair of his perfumed perriwig had received its due quantum of the powdery particles. Foscari, perceiving that Maria Theresa en joyed the above retort, took the liberty of telling her Imperial Majesty, that she might smile, but it was no laughing matter to himself, who, on his return to Venice, after a three years' resi dence at her court, could not boast of having so much as once had the pleasure of beholding her Imperial Majesty's countenance. Maria Theresa, imagining that the Venetian ambassador had attempted to say something very witty, desired him to explain himself. Upon which, Foscari replied, \" May it please your Majesty, I am unfortunately so near sighted, that without my magnifying-glass, I am unable to distinguish the features of any indi vidual I am in conversation with ; but I dare not, of course, venture to make use of it in your Imperial Majesty's presence.\" \" Yes, yes ! Foscari ;\" said the Empress, \" pray make use of your glass as much as you please ; only take care that you do not"], [242, "202 VENICE. magnify my defects !\" Foscari accordingly availed himself of the royal permission, exclaim ing while doing so, \" Bella ! bella ! si, per Dio!'' and continuing to look at her Imperial Majesty, until he quitted the court. The great Francis Foscari was also ambassa dor at Constantinople, at the period when the famous Count de Vergennes was resident in the same capacity. Both of them being men of liberal minds, the Count, discovering the won derful sagacity and superior talents ofFoscari, soon became his most intimate friend, as well as his disciple in politics. During Foscari' s life time, no affair of importance took place in France, after the Count became minister, on which he was not consulted. Happy, most happy, would it have been for France, if her able minister had been at liberty to profit by that great man's counsel ! It was from Foscari, that the Count de Vergennes obtained the famous cypher, by means of which he carried on that impenetrable correspondence, which baffled all the courts of Europe, and even his own most confidential secretaries ; who wrote the letters, and received the answers, in this famous cypher, but nevertheless were unable to guess at a tittle of their contents. This"], [243, "VENICE. 203 cypher afterwards proved of the greatest service to many persons of the highest rank, connected with the French court. And here I cannot but expres my astonish ment, that Madame Campan, who has been so minute in her details of the dreadful sufferings to which the royal family were subjected, should never once have made mention ofthe infamous system of espionage which was resorted to, and the treachery which was used, with regard to the royal correspondence on the most trifling subjects, by the very persons who were in the service ofthe court. Perhaps those individuals were still living at the time of her writing her Memoirs ; and that therefore she was unwilling to subject herself to the vengeance, which an exposure of their baseness might have brought down upon her. Be this as it may, I well know that the Count de Vergennes, during his administration, made use of this cypher, in all matters of importance; and that the whole of his correspondence with Foscari was carried on through the same medium. I know not at what period of the troubles in France \u2014 whether at the time of the famous necklace affair, or after the horrors com mitted at Versailles on the sixth of October, or at a later period of the revolution \u2014 it was put"], [244, "204 VENICE. into the hands of a person who communicated it to the Queen ; but I do know that she was thereby enabled to avoid discoveries in the course of her extensive correspondence. As I was frequently employed in the confidential transactions of the ever-to-be-regretted Marie Antoinette, I often assisted in copying the said despatches, in the presence of the good Madame Campan. It, of course, became necessary that I should have the cypher, to instruct the per sons to whom the letters were addressed, and of which I was generally the bearer, how to arrive at their contents. As the key to it was changed every time, and could be altered at pleasure, it might be ren dered of the greatest utility ; as it was morally impossible for a third person to discover what was passing, though in possession of the cypher and the despatches, without being previously made acquainted with the key fixed on between the writer and the person to whom the letter was addressed. It has ever since remained in my possession. Still further to lengthen this digression. On the day that the King and royal family of France were desirous of going to St. Cloud, at the time when the people were averse to their leaving the Tuilleries, M. de La Fayette, who"], [245, "205 VENICE. commanded the national troops then on guard at the palace, entered the king's closet, for the purpose of knowing his majesty's pleasure. \" From what I have observed from my window,\" said the king, \" I fear our intended journey cannot be carried into effect without bloodshed ; and, that being the case, I shall endeavour to persuade the Queen not to attempt it.\" La Fayette made his bow and retired. On going out of the palace, he met General Bournonville (from whom I had the anecdote), and said to him, \" the king's irresolute conduct this day, will very probably cost me my head, and his majesty his crown. Luckily I have not committed myself, by ordering the troops to make any resistance ; for I am sure I should have been sacrificed, from the king's want of firmness. I wish he may not have cause to repent his excessive condescension to the will of the populace.\" As I have already introduced the name of the great Maria Theresa, the mother of the beautiful Marie Antoinette, I shall wind up this chapter of digressions with a few anecdotes relative to her Imperial Majesty, which were communicated to me, when I visited Vienna, in the year 1794, by the Prince de Ligne."], [246, "206 VENICE. Maria Theresa was considered the hand somest woman of her day. She was the last of the race of the Counts of Hapsburgh, and, history says, of the noble race of Swiss Car bonari, since known by the name and title of the House of Austria. She was married, in the year 1736, to Francis Duke of Lorraine and Bar, generally known by the title of Francis, the first Emperor of Ger many ; by whom the Empress Queen had many children, and to nine of whom I have had the honour of being presented : namely, Joseph the Second ; Leopold the Second, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and afterwards Emperor; Maximilian, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Coadju tor of Cologne and Munster, and Elector of Cologne ; Ferdinand, who was Archduke of Milan ; Caroline, Queen of Sicily ; Marie An toinette, Queen of France ; Maria Amelia, Archduchess of Parma ; Christina, Arch duchess of the Low Countries ; Marianna, Arch abbess of Prague and Clagenfurth ; and Eliza beth, Duchess of Inspruck ; all of whose hands, excepting those of Joseph the Second, I have had the honour of kissing. The Emperor Francis was considered as handsome a man, as Maria Theresa was a"], [247, "207 VENICE. woman. He was crowned Emperor by the name of Francis the First, jointly with his consort ; she being the heiress to the crown. By his affability of deportment, his condescen sion, and his polished manners, he completely won the heart of his beautiful, but haughty empress. Being, however, naturally of a jealous dis position, Maria Theresa soon fancied that she had discovered a growing attachment, on the part of her husband, to one of the beauties of her court, a maid of the royal bed-chamber. Her majesty taxed this innocent female with the suspected crime, in so abrupt a manner, that the lady could not conceal her indignation, and was in the act of quitting the royal pre sence, without deigning to answer the charge. This conduct enraged the great Maria Theresa to such a degree, as to induce her to vent her passion on her supposed rival, by presenting her with an imperial box of the ear. It happened to be levee day. The ante chamber was at this time crowded with com pany, and the celebrated Prince de Ligne was entering the presence chamber, at the very moment when her Majesty had been lavishing her favours with so bountiful a hand. Knowing that his tongue resembled a cathedral bell on"], [248, "208 VENICE. the death of a sovereign, and that if tlie prince left her presence without some explanation, the circumstance would soon be made public to all the inhabitants of Vienna, Maria Theresa, turn ing round to him, with the greatest composure and affability, said \u2014 \" My dear Prince, it is some time since I promised you the order of Maria Theresa, together with my own picture.\" Taking then from her scrutoire an elegant snuff-box, in which was the said order, and on its lid her majesty's portrait, set in diamonds, she presented the Prince with the same, and interrogated him as to what he thought of the likeness. \" Madam,\" replied he, \" the proof you have just now given\" (alluding to the box on the ear) \" is a copy of nature itself.\" On the Prince's returning to the drawing room, where the circumstance had got wind, he was surrounded by a crowd of courtiers, who had heard the quarrel, and were all anxious for his explanation of the cause of it. Observing this, the Prince showed the box and the portrait to a lady who was standing near him, saying at the same time, in a tone sufficiently loud to be heard by her Majesty \u2014 \" the present makes me forget the past !\" Maria Theresa was so jealous of her husband, that on his going one evening to the Free"], [249, "209 VENICE. Mason's club without first acquainting her with his intention, she had the Lodge surrounded by guards ; and, on the officer who commanded them demanding, in her Majesty's name, the immediate dispersion of the meeting, Francis, presenting himself, said, \" Return to the Em press, your mistress, and inform her that, wher ever her husband is one of the number, she may rest assured that nothing of a treasonable nature will ever be plotted against her, or against the state.\" CHAPTER XXI.

The armies of either of those powers, on enter ing the Venetian territories, were immediately met by an armed force, and conducted by it to the frontiers. But then the Republic had in constant activity from thirty to forty thousand troops \u2014 a number which was more than suf ficient to keep either party in awe ; besides four and-twenty ships of war, ready to be launched, in case of an aggression on the part of any one ofthe said powers. The wisdom of such a step on the part of the Government was obvious, since it effectually protected its subjects from molestation. The advantages resulting from such a line of con duct may be guessed at from the fact, that the Republic never once compromised its neutrality with any of the belligerent powers, but always maintained a rigid impartiality, and thereby caused itself to be alike respected and feared. From the year 1780 to the year 1793 or 1794, the Republic was the richest, the most flourish ing, and the most popular power in all Italy. It had not been engaged in war, whether in ternal or external, for many, many years. The"], [251, "211 VENICE. population, throughout the whole Venetian territory, was exasperated beyond measure against the sanguinary Masnadieri, who had butchered the King and Queen of France. All that they wanted was a leader ; and, if an able one had stepped forward, the horde that was then spreading devastation and ruin over all Italy would have been exterminated root and branch. Nothing was wanted but the countenance and encouragement of the govern ment ; and, in vindication of that government from the foul charges which have been brought against it, I am bound to declare, that their folly in rejecting the wise proposition for keep ing up an armed force, ready to check the violence of the French invader, was the chief cause of their ruin, and of his aggrandizement. It was Pesaro\u2014 the base, the imbecile, the treacherons Pesaro \u2014 who bullied the Senate into a departure from their former system of an armed neutrality. The spirit of vigorous re sistance which actuated the Dandolos, the Zens, the Trons, the Barbarigos, and that pater patri\u0153 Francesco Foscari, had long since fled, and those great-men buried in the general ruin. The consideration is a truly awful one. The bare idea of seeing from ten to fifteen thousand individuals, of all descriptions, on one p2"], [252, "212 VENIC E. day in a state of comfort and even of afflu ence, and on the next thrown upon the very pave, is enough to rouse the most sluggish of mortals into activity, \" be his brains as barren as the banks of Libya.\" And such must ever be the case, during the interregnum between the downfall of one government and the organiza tion of a new one. When Francesco Pesaro first came to Venice, as the Austrian Commissary-General, furnished with full powers to inflict on his countrymen that persecution, imprisonment, and banish ment, which he himself so richly merited at their hands, for having first betrayed and then deserted the government, a grand fete was given at the Filarmonica to this modern Sylla, at which Madame Grassini was engaged to sing. When I entered the saloon, the concert had already commenced ; and a gentleman, one of the chers amis of the above singer, whose name was Giuseppe Ferro, a corn-factor, obli gingly gave up his own seat for my accom modation. Of course, I entered into that kind of conversation with him which his civility demanded. On the other side of the saloon was seated the great Francesco Pesaro. As soon as the first act of the concert was over, my husband, being"], [253, "213 V E N I C E. an old acquaintance of the mighty man, went across the room to congratulate him on his return to his country ; and, pointing to the spot where I was sitting, he said, \" Yonder is my better half; but she is so near-sighted, that I am sure she cannot distinguish your Excellency at this distance.\" \u2014 \" What,\" replied Pesaro, \" the lady who is conversing with the gentle man by the side of her ? I must go and have a little chat with her.\" Accordingly, Pesaro crossed the saloon, and very politely seated him self by me, and asked who the person was who had so much engaged my attention, as to pre vent me from recognizing him. Unluckily for the poor man, I replied, \" It is M. Ferro, to whose politeness I am indebted for my seat.\" \u2014 \" What !\" exclaimed Pesaro, \" that birbone, who was a member of the municipality ?\" \u2014 \" The same,\" said I ; \" and who, at the time of the downfall of the government, deserved so much from his country, by preventing the city from falling a prey to the plunder of the Schiavoni.\" On that very night, poor Ferro was arrested by the agents of Pesaro ; dragged from his rela tives, who entirely depended on him for their subsistence, without any accusation being ad duced against him, without being heard in his pS"], [254, "214 VENICE. defence, or allowed to communicate with any one of his family, or receive the smallest assis tance ; and sent off as a galley slave, to work on the Danube at Olmutz ; where he remained until the French retook the Venetian territories, when, with many others, he was released from captivity, and restored to his numerous friends and distressed relations. It was currently reported, that Pesaro had a list of nearly three hundred individuals, who were to have shared the fate of poor Ferro ; if Providence, in its mercy, had not ordered it otherwise, by shortly afterwards calling the unfeeling and unprincipled man before that awful tribunal, against whose decision there is no appeal. The wretched man was seized with excessive delirium, brought on by turning a private difference into public revenge, and expired after an illness of a few days. His death gave life and liberty to some of the most distinguished of his fellow-citizens. He might truly be considered as the malignant genius of the Venetians, in the same way as the hunch backed Visconti was of the Milanese. What I have further to say respecting Venice will principally consist of miscellaneous anec dotes, collected during my long residence in this interesting city, calculated to make my"], [255, "215 VENICE. readers still further acquainted with the man ners and the customs of its inhabitants under their happy Republic. I have already mentioned the Ducal Palace. In the hall of the Pregadi, which was furnished with benches having backs to them, the Senate formerly assembled. When any of those warm debates took place of which I have elsewhere spoken, it was customary for the barcajuoli, or boatmen belonging to the patricians, to assemble with their gondolas on the canal, close to that side of the palace which overlooked the port ; considering themselves the second body in the state, and the native defenders of the first. If, during the time that the senators were shut up in close deliberation, which in the winter often continued till late in the night, any disturbance happened to take place, they would shew their vigilance, by watching the motions of the people around them with circumspec tion, and without betraying the slightest impa tience or inquietude, or vaunting themselves on being engaged in the service of i principi, as they were accustomed to denominate theii masters. Ministering to the inclinations of the nobles, and being the confidants of their pleasures, as well as a sort of mouchards of the government, p 4"], [256, "216 VENICE. each of them fancied himself in the secrets of the state. They would nevertheless treat those of their own calling, who were not so fortunate as to be in the service of the nobles, on a foot ing of equality, considering them as brothers ; which, indeed, is the word they make use of whenever they meet. \" Addio caro fradelf' \" perme fradel,\" &c, are the customary saluta tions on passing and repassing in their gondolas, calling to one another, \" non travagliar, non strascinar, i poveri cristiani.\" When this conduct is contrasted with the language of vulgar abuse made use of by the hackney-coachmen and watermen of London and Paris, the Venetian Gondolieri actually appear to be saint?. This striking difference is mainly to be at* tributed to their detestation of the filthy habit of intoxication \u2014 a virtue common to the whole tribe. I have seen many of the Gondolieri who actually knew Tasso by heart, and would recite, or rather chant, whole stanzas, while rowing the passengers along the canals. The practice is, however, rare at present. And, no wonder ! For the very appearance of the German sauer kroute gentry, is sufficient to drive from the heads of these poor fellows, all remembrance of the sweet strains of the divine author of La Geru salemme Liberata !"], [257, "217 V E N I C E. The Gondolieri are, in general, a robust race of men, remarkably well made, healthy, good looking, cleanly in their persons, and frugal in their mode of living. They participate in the natural gaiety of their country, and pass the greater part of their lives, tete-a-tete with nobles, citizens, and the strangers of distinc tion who daily arrive at Venice. From their native intelligence and vivacity they often start subjects of conversation, and are suffered to use a greater portion of freedom, in their intercourse with passengers, than is usually accorded to persons gaining their livelihood by a manual occupation. Of the truth of this remark, let the reader take the following as an instance. In Venice, the streets are lighted up at night with small lamps, pretty much in the same way as the streets of Paris. As one of the Gondolieri was drawing the lamp up, a noble patrician, who happened to be passing, desired him to raise it a little higher. Upon which the man answered, \" It is sufficiently high for your and my horns to pass under, but if those of your Excellency are longer than mine, I will certainly draw up the lamp, so that you may pass on without coming in contact with it.\" I had this anecdote from the gentleman who was the cause of it,"], [258, "218 VENICE. and who hastened with it to the Casino ; where it formed the subject of the evening's conver sazione, and certainly lost nothing of its spright liness by the manner in which it was related. So attached are the Gondolieri to their watery element, that if they happen to have a dispute with a man coming from Mestre or Fusina, two small towns which are only three or four miles from Venice, and are asked by their comrades who he is, they answer, \" mi so un Jbresto, cki vien da ga del diavolo \u2014 he is a foreigner, and comes from the devil knows where.\" One of these barcajuoli being on a visit at Genoa to his sister, who was a dancer at the theatre there, happening to be looking at one of the famous stone bridges of that city, a per son accosted him, and asked whether he was not a stranger : the poor fellow answered in the negative. On returning to his sister's lodg ing, he told her, laughingly, what had taken place. \" Vu sta,\" said he, \" che vi conta una bella storia : stavo guardar quel ponte la su ; mi vien uno a domandarmi se son foresto ?\" \" I hope,\" said his sister, \" you answered yes ?\" \" Buzzera /\" continued he, \" ho detto che son Venezian\" \" But,\" rejoined his sister, \" you are at this present time at Genoa, and are therefore a stranger.\" It, how-"], [259, "219 VENICE. ever, took a great deal of time to convince the man that he could be a stranger, out of Venice. On the feast of San Rocco, the Doge and Senate used to hear mass at that beautiful church in great state. The procession was conveyed in peotas, or covered barges. I was once present when it was passing under one of the bridges ; where two or three of the unem ployed Gondolieri belonging to their Excellencies were belabouring with their tongues those who were engaged in rowing the cortege. The wordy contest brought to the windows of their boats the whole of the Signoria, who seemingly enjoyed with much good-natured satisfaction the native sallies of this privileged order. In deed, the Gondolieri of Venice appear to pos sess prerogatives similar to those which were formerly exercised by M. de Roquelaure, at the court of Lewis the Fourteenth : \" on lew fait honneur de tous les bons-mots, que des raisons de decence ou de politique ne permettent pas aux veritable peres de se declarer.\" From the period of the rupture which took place between the Republic , and Benedict the Fourteenth, that Pope refused to give a car dinal's hat to any of the Venetian bishops. At his death, when Rozzonico, the cardinal bishop of Padua, was elected to the holy see, the Gon-"], [260, "220 VENICE. dolieri, as he was a Venetian by birth, were ac customed to say, \" We have long been without hats; but now we have the hatter \u2014 abbiamo adesso il capelliere.\" The anniversary of the Festa di San Rocco still continues to be the day on which the Vene tian artists exhibit their annual performances in the Scuola di San Rocco. It is one of the first academies in Venice, and is filled with the works of Tintoretto, Titian, Paul Veronese, and other eminent masters. I was amazingly struck with Tintoretto's picture of the Annunciation\u2014 as well as with many others. It has never been ascertained, whether the President Montesquieu paid a visit to Venice as an indifferent traveller, or as a mouchard of the court of France \u2014 (which court was constantly in the habit of giving those honourable com missions to persons of all ranks and classes, not excepting the fair sex) \u2014 or whether it was to collect information, from the valuable political manuscripts in which the Republic abounded, and which might furnish matter for his cele brated work, \" I' Esprit des Loix.\" Whatever might have been the President's motives, his conduct during his stay excited considerable suspicion. He was observed run ning from one coffee-house to another ; interro-"], [261, "221 V E N I C E. gating every body who would listen to him ; and taking copies and drawings of every thing he saw and heard. At length he received a significant hint, that his longer stay at Venice would neither be agreeable to the Government nor to the French ambassador ; and at the same time he was particularly cautioned, to be ex tremely careful with regard to his papers ; as, in crossing the lakes from Venice to Fusina, it was not improbable that he would be arrested on his journey. He therefore shortly after took his leave of Venice, with his head full ofthe Canal Orfano* The Baron was not arrested ; but, when he was in the middle of the lakes, perceiving another gondola making up to him, he fancied he was going to be attacked, and, in his panic, had recourse to the expedient of Castor, when pur sued by the hunters ; and, taking from his tra- * The rumour runs, that the Venetian Government used to cause their state prisoners to be privately strangled in their cells, and then thrown into the above canal.

The whole, however, was a man\u0153uvre played off to frighten the author of the \" Spirit of Laws.\" If the Baron had had sufficient courage to direct his gondolier to proceed, he would have passed on unmolested ; as the individuals employed to put the trick into execution were ordered not to impede his departure by ex amining his baggage ; but the fear of being pursued by the boats of the Sbirraglia, made the author of \" I' Esprit\" lose his spirits, and every other consideration but personal safety. The communications between Venice and various parts of the Terra Firma are so nume rous, that, besides the different Duganas, or custom-houses, the lakes were covered with boats filled with Sbirri; and, if a foreigner hap pened not to be accompanied by an ambassa dor's gondola, he was often subjected to repeated unpleasant visits from this honourable class of Venetian Bow Street runners. They dared not, however, to approach the gondolas of a foreign minister, a consul, or their agents ; which were considered sacred. At that time, every body wore silk stockings, and no person of decent appearance would have thought"], [263, "223 V E N I C E. of entering the theatre, or the casinos, in boots, for fear of being suspected of having been con fined for felony, and of wearing them to hide the marks of the chains on his legs. Such, indeed, was the common observation of the Venetians on persons who were discovered to be thus habited. Though the stocking weavers of Venice were unable to furnish a tenth part of the quantity necessary for the supply of the inhabitants, those manufactured in France were strictly prohibited. But, notwithstanding this prohi bition, every body wore them ; and even the sbirraglia would supply the dealers in contraband goods with them, as well as private families. The Republic therefore thought proper to take off the prohibition, and allowed the stockings to enter the Venetian states, on paying, at the rate of a livre a pair, duty. The contraband traffic still continuing, the duty was reduced first to half a livre, and next to only twopence the pair ; after which, it was not worth the while, for so small a sum, to run the risk of selling them. Thus was the contraband traffic in stockings put an end to, and the article made a source of considerable revenue to the state ; and thus were many thousands produced to the Government, which before were divided be-"], [264, "224 VENICE. tween a few worthless wretches, who lived by the perversion of that justice, which they were paid liberal salaries to uphold.

An immense cable was fastened to the top of the steeple, which was let down the whole of its length, until it reached the pavement. Both of its extremities being made secure, a man, who was paid for the occasion, after a small cord had been fastened round one of his wrists and another round one of his ancles, would slide down from the topmost extremity to the ground, VOL. I. Q"], [266, "226 VENICE. bearing a small flag in his hand ; to the great delight and astonishment of the numerous spec tators. To the \" Volo dal Campanile,\" Captain Manby is indebted for his contrivance for saving the lives of shipwrecked mariners ; only he has added thereto a basket, or cradle, in which a man is placed, and propelled forward, like the Venetian flyer of the Giovedi grasso. The moveable pyramids and Moresco broad sword amusements were performed by the Niccolotti and the Castellani, two parties who took their names from the parishes in which they were born. The inhabitants of the said parishes were always, once a-year, opposed to one another in the performance of sundry feats of strength, on two different platforms, erected at a certain distance opposite each other. At the success or failure of any of their evolu tions, violent applauses or hissings were vocife rated by the friends of one party, to the annoy ance of the other. The amusements, or games, consisted in forming pyramids of twenty or thirty men, piled one upon another, beginning with three or four, and increasing the number, according to the figure intended to be exhibited ; sometimes beginning with the greater number, and dimi nishing in size, to a considerable height, until"], [267, "227 VENICE. the whole terminated with a child, who would climb from one man's shoulder to another, until he had reached the top. When this amusement was over, another would commence. It was called \" il giuoco Moresco,\" and was a sort of attack between the parties with the broadsword. These diversions for the lower orders gene rally took place while the patricians were rusti cating at their delicious villas, on the banks of the Brenta or elsewhere, in all the luxury of eastern splendour. In imitation of the Romans, it was the uni form policy of the Venetians to keep alive a party-spirit between their subjects, and to ply them with amusements, that they might have no leisure for reflection. But in latter times, Venice has, in fact, possessed a numerous popu lation, but no canaglia ; and divided bodies are ever the most easy to govern, and the surest to be conquered. Subtraction is a favourite rule in the arithmetic of politicians, and all govern ments are tolerably perfect in their practice of it. The policy that unfortunately is so preva lent on the Continent, appears to be a close imitation of the doctrines of the Florentine Secretary, Machiavelli, who says, \" With respect to the means of holding in subjection states q 2"], [268, "228 VENICE. once accustomed to be governed by their own laws \u2014 destroy them, especially the nobles and the men of power ; as they can never forget what they have been, and seldom or ever for give those who have been the cause of their privations.\" Though Venice produces nothing, no city in Europe is more abundantly or more luxuriously supplied with the necessaries as well as the delicacies of life. People often come to Venice from the Terra Firma, to enjoy fruit in the highest perfection. As it is brought thither by water carriage, it is not liable to be softened or bruised, and the beautiful bloom is thereby pre served as if it were still on the tree. The Venetian poultry, too, is generally of excellent flavour. The fish also, which come from the sea to fatten themselves in the rich lakes that surround the city, are larger and better flavoured than in any other sea-port. The oysters of the Arsenal were an article of considerable profit to the persons engaged in raising them, and were the largest and best tasted in theworld. As I have touched on the subject of eatables, I shall, for the instruction as well as consolation of our English gourmands, who may be thinking of paying a visit to Italy, here give them a"], [269, "VENICE. 229 slight foretaste of the delicacies for which its principal towns and cities are most celebrated. Piedmont is famous for producing the best rice in the peninsula, and for its truffles, which are dug out of the earth by dogs trained for the occasion, and of a peculiar breed. Milan is the only place for the delicious mascaron, made of fresh cream in little round pats, about the size of half a pound of butter. The Stracchin cheese is of a square form ; it weighs about six or eight pounds, and is made entirely of rich cream. Lodi and Orio are the only parts of Italy that produce the real Parmasan, though it is made in many other provinces. It takes its name from Parma being at one time the principal deposit for the wholesale consumption of it; but not one of these famous cheeses was ever made in that town. At Bergamo are manufactured the best sugar plums, and what is called la mustarda, which consists of a variety of rich fruits preserved in jars, with a mixture of clarified sugar and mus tard. At the time of the Carnival it produces a considerable profit to the dealers therein, as it is sent all over Italy ; as well as a paste made of almonds and sugar, called mandolata. Brescia is famous for a kind of very fat small a 3"], [270, "230 VENICE. bird, called gl'uccelli dei Ronchi, and for its polenta, or Indian corn. Verona, Este, and Monselice are distinguished for the finest fruits of all kinds, and the salame col aglio, which are large sausages stuffed with garlick. Vicenza is unrivalled for its grapes and sweet wines, which are of a flavour different from that of the wines of all the other parts of Italy. At Padua are made the famous osso callo and fuccacie, which resemble the buns that are cut to make rusks of, but infinitely superior, and especially at Easter. Genoa formerly de rived considerable advantage from the sale of its excellent zucca Candida, its pumkins, its pre served citrons, its large and small pastry of all descriptions, and its candied sweetmeats, dried mushrooms, and vegetables. Parma and Modena are celebrated for their small hams, of a most delicious flavour. They are cut into slices almost as thin as wafers, and packed in boxes ; and, together with their zam pini, a pig's leg with the bone taken out and stuffed with exquisite sausages, once formed a considerable portion of a not inactive com merce, and were sent by the Ducal family, as presents to the several Continental courts. Bologna is the only place in Italy for what are called the bandola investita, and for all"], [271, "231 VENICE. kinds of sausages ; Florence for its perfumery, and, like Lucca, for its oils and rosoglias of herbs, which are exported to all parts of Europe; Rome for its wild and water fowls, its vege tables, and in particular for its brocoli ; Naples for its incomparable mustacciuli, its maccaroni, and its cascia cavallo, a famous cheese used therewith, when not cooked with sughilio, the extract of stewed beef in wine, with all kinds of spices and herbs. The ices of Naples are superior to those of any other part of Italy. The plate-glass manufactory on the island of Murano, at the distance of about a mile from Venice, is perhaps one of the finest in all Europe ; though, like every thing else on the Venetian territory, excepting despotism, it is greatly on the decline. Certain secrets with respect to glass-making were confined to the Venetians. The substance that is to form the mirror, of a certain size, is taken out of the furnace by means of a machine with a wooden handle, and the workmen keep turning it round with the greatest velocity, until it has attained the desired length ; when, with an immense pair of scissors, they cut asunder the fiery sub stance, and instantly roll it on stone, where it congeals, and becomes the most perfect of its kind. The Venetians were also the first who in- q 4"], [272, "232 VENICE. vented the several kinds of glass beads, of various colours and shapes ; and those which they now manufacture, and which are worked into purses, bags, necklaces, and other ornaments, are still the best in all Europe. Burrano was famous for the Venetian point lace ; from which place Louis the Fourteenth seduced a number of the workmen to France, where he established the first lace manufactory. In the same manner, Charles the Fifth esta blished a similar manufactory at Brussels and elsewhere. Was not the very first vessel of war that carried a cannon, of Venetian origin ? Venice was the parent of other maritime states ; and, to such a pitch of perfection had she arrived, that the dresses, the manners, and the customs of her inhabitants were adopted by the rest of Europe, long before the reign of Queen Eliza beth. A slight reference to the plays of the immortal Shakespeare, will convince the reader, that that great master of the passions and pro found judge of human nature, was accustomed to consider the Venetians, as they were repre sented in the portraits of Titian and others, to be models of elegance in dress ; the men wear ing their beards, and the women their brocades, bracelets, &c. He repeatedly compliments the"], [273, "VENICE. 233 Venetians; and, in \"Love's Labour Lost,\" makes one of his characters exclaim \" Ah, good old Mantuan ! I may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice ; Venegia, Venegia, Chi non te vide, ei non te pregia.\" that is, \" O Venice, Venice, he who has never seen thee, has thee not in esteem. \" The circumstance ofthe corps diplomatique being interdicted from every kind of intercourse with the patricians and the Government, ex cept on public occasions, in consequence of the conspiracy against the Republic formed by the Marquis of Bedmar, ambassador from the court of France, in conjunction with the Duke d'Ossuno and the Spanish governor of the Milanese, suggested the story of Otway's Venice Preserved. An amazing number of merchants of all na tions settled themselves at Venice, and were tolerated in the enjoyment of their different religions, and protected in the free exercise of them. There was a quarter for the Germans, and another for the Turks, who were not per mitted to be seen out of their habitations after sunset. The number of libraries, printing offices, and of booksellers' shops at Venice ex-"], [274, "234 VENICE. ceeded that of any other city of Italy. The communication, by means of canals, with most of the large rivers of the Terra Firma, gave the greatest facilities to every kind of commerce. In short, no foreigner possessing genius and industry could leave Venice but with regret. For years after he had quitted that city, Cardinal de Bernis was accustomed to speak of the spot, and of its inhabitants, with the greatest warmth of delight. When tlie Lombards and the Jews ceased to have the advantage of the Venetian navigation, they emigrated, with their immense riches, to England ; and, to the rich bankers who laid out their vast capitals in building, is London in debted for the well known street which has ever since born their name. The Jews who remained at Venice set about repairing their losses, by becoming money lenders to all the sovereigns of Europe ; and, from the enormous profits which they derived from the interest they exacted, were they enabled to build the Ghetto, a place of residence exclusively appropriated for the Israelitish tribe, situate near the canal Regio ; and the gates of which, after sunset, were closed, and not a soul was suffered to enter or go out. In this part of the city they were compelled to"], [275, "235 VENICE. reside, until the revolution took place in 1796. It formed a little town of itself, and as the Venetian nobility declined, commerce became almost entirely confined to that quarter. The Lombards were, to the full, as usuriously in clined as the sons of Israel were. The rate of interest to be taken on their loans and money transactions was regulated by the tribunal of the Pioveggi. Let me here digress for a moment, and offer a word or two in behalf of the much vilified and much despised Jewish nation. In an age like the present, teeming with benevolent pro jects of all descriptions, and overflowing with the milk and honey of universal philanthropy, surely it behoves the several governments of the civilized world to take the condition of this most remarkable people into their serious consideration, and, together with the other re strictions imposed on them, to do away with the harsh, as well as impolitic law which prevents a Hebrew from possessing landed property, by which he becomes of course exempted from certain contributions towards the expenses of the state, paid by all other classes of his Ma jesty's subjects. Many of these Jews, as we all know, are excellent members of society, and deserve to be set free from those disgraceful"], [276, "236 VENICE. shackles, which were thought neccessary in the early ages of Christianity. I have been credibly informed, that all the tribes feel the privations to which they are sub jected most poignantly. Ought we then to be surprised, if we sometimes find them immo lating on the altar of avarice, those miserable Christians who resort to them for loans in the hour of distress, and exclaiming, in the lan guage of Shylock, with feelings partaking less of remorse, than of fell revenge ? \" I am a Jew : and, hath not a Jew eyes ? hath not a Jew hands? organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is ? If you prick us, do we not bleed ? if you tickle us, do we not laugh ? if you poison us, do we not die ? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge ? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Chris tian, what is his humility ? revenge : If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example ? why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute ; and it shall go hard, but I will better the instruction.\" Satisfied I am, that until a complete and entire amalgamation of the two parties shall have been effected, the mutual interest of Christian and Jew will not have been placed on its proper basis."], [277, "237 VENICE. Formerly, the kings. of England were accus tomed to look upon the descendants of Abra ham as their property ; indeed, they were expressly called the king's \" chattels.\" So strong did the popular tide run against them, that in the year 1348, when a fatal endemic distemper raged in a great portion of Europe, it was given out that they had poisoned the springs and wells : in consequence of which, a million and a half of them were cruelly mas sacred. Again, in the year 1492, half a million of them were driven out of Spain, and one hun dred and fifty thousand out of Portugal. In short, they were every where persecuted, and most rigorously treated. In Spain, many of them were actually burnt alive, and their sufferings became a source of amusement to the people. The satirical Doctor Swift, in his celebrated Drapier's Letters, tells a story of a Jew at Madrid, who being con demned to the fire on account of his religion, a crowd of school -boys following him to the stake, and apprehending they might lose their sport if he should happen to recant, would, from time to time, clap him on the back, and cry, \" Sta Jirme, Moyse /\" that is \u2014 \" Moses, continue stedfast.\""], [278, "238 VENICE. If my memory does not fail me, Mr. Hob house, one of the representatives for West minster, the most enlightened city in the empire, signified, some time ago, his determination to bring the case of this oppressed people fairly before the British Parliament. Most earnestly do I hope that this active senator will persevere in his intention ; and happy, thrice happy shall I be, if the present intimation should have a tendency, however trifling, to spur him on to a perseverance in his praiseworthy design. His unwearied endeavours to procure for us the light of heaven, untaxed, are duly appreciated by his countrymen ; and I will add, by his coun trywomen also : and Mr. Hobhouse may rest assured, that an endeavour to dispel the mental darkness which has been engendered by that \" sufferance,\" which, for so many ages, has been \" the badge of all the tribe,\" will be con sidered no less laudable. That he will be seconded in his efforts by all those members who uniformly advocate the cause of free discussion and of universal tolera tion, I cannot, for one moment, doubt. Guess ing from their patronymics, several of our sena tors cannot be far removed in blood from the oppressed race : to suppose, therefore, that they would not joyfully step forward, and afford the"], [279, "239 VENICE. representative for Westminster their cordial support, would be to suppose them possessed by the marble-hearted fiend, Ingratitude ; which, when it shows itself in a child, has been pro nounced \" more hideous than the sea-monster.\" But, while the Senate shall be thus actively occupied in the cause of the sons of Israel, ought not the Stage to step forward, and lend its powerful aid towards the accomplishment of the alta impresa? To this end, I beg leave, strenuously to recommend to Mr. Elliston, the spirited lessee of Drury Lane Theatre, a revival of the late Mr. Cumberland's admirable comedy of \" The Jew.\" The play was eminently successful, at a time by no means so favourable for the incul cation of the principles I am laying down as the present. In the hands of that chastest of all performers, Mr. Dowton, Sheva would find as able a representative as Doctor Cantwell has done. Liston, too\u2014 the laugh-inspiring Liston \u2014 in the part of Jabal, the Jew's servant, would delight the town not less than he has done in Mawworm. To heighten the attraction, songs, according to the custom of the day, might be introduced with considerable effect. The part of Frederick might be allotted to Braham ; while Eliza Radcliffe would find an interesting representative in the sweet warbler Stephens."], [280, "240 VENICE. Thus, instead of receiving our impressions of the whole tribe, from \" the Jew which Shake speare drew,\" \u2014 brutal, vindictive, uncharitable, extortionate, his bags running over with the spoils of usury, and his veins glutted with the blood of prodigals, gamesters, and unfortunate merchants, we should constantly have before our eyes, the generous Hebrew of Cumberland, \u2014 the widow's friend, the orphan's father, the poor man's protector, and the universal philan thropist; who \"neither buries his riches in a synagogue or any other pile, nor wastes it upon vanity or public works ; but who leaves it to a charitable heir, and builds his hospital in the human heart.\" Thus would the stray sheep of the scattered flock of Abraham at length have fair play ; and, that such an appeal to the kind feelings, the good sense, and the strict justice of Englishmen, would be made in vain, is, I think, impossible \u2014 \" In hearts like theirs', there will be found a place, For ev'ry victim of unjust disgrace.\""], [281, "241 CHAPTER XXIII.

Many of the noble Venetians were accus tomed to advance money for carrying on the commerce of the Republic, and were indirectly connected with the merchants of the Terra Firma. At Verona, Padua, and Vicenza, there were considerable manufactories of silks, gauzes, ribbons, artificial flowers, and whalebone : there were also cloth manufactures at Schio, and other places in the territories of the Republic. At Venice, too, the same manufactures were carried on, but in still greater variety ; such as rich damasks, brocades, gold and silver tissues, and velvets. The gold chains of Venice, with its gold lace and trimmings, were the admiration of all Europe. The city was also celebrated VOL. I. K"], [282, "242 VENICE. for its wax, and cream of tartar ; for its glass and pearl beads ; for its silk stockings and lace; and particularly for its scarlet cloth and snuffs. The triacca manufactured at Venice, is used as a general medicine ; it is composed of various drugs, and is considered to be an antidote against the sting of venomous reptiles. Many of the above articles were at one time a source of considerable profit to the ambassadors, con suls, and other agents of the Republic, at the several foreign courts, on account of their great superiority over those of other nations. Its numerous festivals rendered Venice one of the most interesting cities in the universe. Amongst others, there were those of Santa Marta, San Rocco, il Redentore, la Saluta, San Marco, Corpus Domine, and the Assenzione ; on the latter of which days the Doge used to go to Lido, a small island two miles from Venice, near the entrance of the Adriatic, for the pur pose of espousing that sea, in the Bucentoro, a vessel somewhat resembling the ancient Greek and Roman gallies. It was richly carved, and covered with fine gold in basso-relievo, lined with the richest crimson silk velvet, trimmed with gold fringe and tassels, and furnished in the most elegant and costly manner, with beau tiful Venetian mirrors, crystal cut ornaments,"], [283, "243 VENICE. large pier glass windows, with Venetian blinds and crimson silk curtains. It used to be towed out by a number of the barcajuoli, richly dres sed in the ancient Venetian costume, with caps and sashes of different colours, all bearing the Doge's livery. The Doge was habited in his ducal robes, his coronet, and the other insignia of his high office. The whole body of the senators, with their wives and families, magni ficently attired, joined the procession in gon dolas, together with all the foreign ministers, and often a hundred thousand persons, coming not only from the Terra Firma, but from the extre mity of Italy, and even of Europe ; so that the water, from the ducal palace of the Piazzetta to Lido, was actually covered with boats, filled with youth and beauty in all their most seduc tive shapes and appearances, forming an entire carpet of boats of all descriptions ; besides peottis, in the shape of ancient temples and tri umphal cars, representing the courts of Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Bacchus, Apollo, together with Neptune, and the rest of the marine deities ; so that it was scarcely possible to discover a foot of water. The ceremony was called the marriage of the sea. The Doge, on his arrival at the mouth of the harbour, came on deck, and being sur- si 2"], [284, "244 VENICE. rounded by the senate, he took from his finger a gold ring, and throwing it into the sea, he pronounced these words, \" Disponsamus te, Mare ! in signum veri perpetuique dominii ;\" that is, \" We espouse thee, O sea ! in token of real and perpetual dominion.\" The Doge and senate then returned in the same order to the ducal palace, where a sump tuous banquet was prepared, consisting of all the delicacies of the season ; and at the close of which each senator was presented with a large tray, or basket, filled with the choicest fruits and sweetmeats, to take home to his family. This was indeed a day of festivity and triumph for the Venetians, and turned out highly lucra tive to all classes of the inhabitants. The famous ducal barge of which I have spoken, the Bucentoro, which, as its name im plies, was capable of containing two hundred persons, was destroyed by the French for the sake of its gold, and chopped in pieces, together with four-and-twenty ships of war in the arse nal. Nay, the very arsenal itself was nearly demolished by those modern liberators. It was wittily observed by one of the barcajuoli to his comrades, \" I Francese non sono tutti ladri, ma Buona-parte /\" The French also destroyed the famous beds of oysters which were formerly"], [285, "245 VENICE. in the arsenal, and which were esteemed the largest and finest flavoured in Europe. After the festivities of the Ascension the Venetians commenced their villegiatura, or rural diversions, on both sides of the banks of the Brenta ; which, for the space of one-and-twenty miles, as far as Padua, are ornamented with numerous beautiful palaces, built by Palladio and Sansovino, and the fronts of many of which were painted by Paul Veronese. These palaces are the villas of the patricians and of the rich merchants. The country along the Brenta is really a terrestrial paradise. In my opinion, there is no spot of the globe that can be placed in compa rison with it. The meadows and gardens all around are highly cultivated and fertile, and terminate most agreeably. What is very extra ordinary, no two of the palaces are alike. Most of them have their fronts looking towards the river. I did not, however, recognize in the Brenta, so readily as Mr. Addison seems to have done, the Timavus \u2014 Unde per ora novem vasto cum murmure moniis, It mare proruptum, et pelago premit arva sonanti ;\" though Virgil adds, \" Hie tamen ille urbem Patavi sedesque locavit Teucrorum.\" rS"], [286, "246 VENICE. The mode of living during the villegiatura, was exactly the same as at Venice- The ladies never rose till the middle of the day. After breakfast they put on their morning dress, and either walked or rode out : they would then come home, and after taking the bath, dress for dinner ; at five they would take coffee, sleep till seven or eight, prepare for the evening par ties, which continued till about midnight, and then go to the casinos to play at cards, or for the sake of the conversazione ; and at about two or three in the morning, and sometimes later, they would return home to rest. The opera at Venice did not commence till between nine and ten, and was seldom over before two or three in the morning ; but no lady of rank would even then think of going home, before she had taken a few hands at the casino. On some mornings they would visit the Erberia, to see the delightful fruits and flowers brought to the market from the Terra Firma, and then they would go home to bed. The Benzona, the Albrizzi Teutocchi, the Giustina Micheli, the Tron, the Cavaliera Con tarini, the Labbia, the Pesaro, and in short all the ladies of the haut-ton, would not, when young, have thought of shewing themselves in society before midnight. But now, alas ! they"], [287, "247 V E N I C E. are all the worse for the wear ; and though they still adhere to the old proverb, that \" women and linen look to the greatest advantage by candle-light,\" and though tight lacing and long waisted stays will go a good way towards hiding much superabundant substance, the ill-natured old gentleman with his scythe, however much the diurnal supply of blooming roses and of fresh lilies may put new faces on old bodies, is constantly holding up his hour-glass, and intimat ing that he has little or no respect for a figure of 6 with an 0 after it. It may, however, be laid down as a maxim, that women are as old as they look, and men as old as they feel. Old women, like old gui neas, are worth their weight in gold. Madame Tron was once very much offended with a gen tleman who asked her how old she was ? \" I never give myself the trouble,\" replied she, \" to think about my enemies.\" \u2014 \" Well,\" said the gentleman, \" we were children together, and I am seventy.\" \u2014 \" What's that to me ?\" rejoined Madame Tron. \u2014 \" Yes, but you have a daugh ter who is between forty and fifty.\" \u2014 \" And pray, Mr. Busybody, what has the age of my daughter to do with mine ? Thank God,\" said she, \" the Libro d'Oro is destroyed,\" (which was the register of the ages of all the patri- r 4"], [288, "248 VENICE. cians) ; \" at least we have gained that by the revolution ; there is no more prying into the secret of a woman's age, Mr. Inquisitive !\" The palace of Madame Benzona, on the grand canal, near San Benedetto, together with the distinguished beauty and the great merits of this Venetian matron, though so often sung and so universally admired, ought not to be passed over in silence, in a work professing to contain anecdotes of a city, in which, from her amiable and polished manners, she has shone forth so pre-eminently. The mansion of this celebrated lady, though she is now in very slender circumstances, con tinues to be visited by the natives, as well as by foreigners of the first distinction. Her name stands high on the annals of gallantry, both for her extraordinary condescension, and for her easy and indiscriminate compliance, from the prince down to the barcajuolo. The prop of her house is said to be the Cavalier Giuseppe Trevis, a rich Jew merchant. Being of a very tolerant disposition, persons of all religions as well as nations, are received by her on terms of equal hospitality and good breeding. Her house is also visited by Pindemonte Lamberti, the translator of Homer, and by other men of genius ; though she has recently been excluded"], [289, "249 VENICE. the society of the court converzatione, in con sequence of German etiquette, whereby blood only constitutes merit, and merit without blood is considered, like a race-horse, as having no merit at all. Madame Abrizzi Tuetocchi was first married to the poor Bernabotti Marini. Finding it more convenient, after having had a son by her rich cavalier servante, to become the wife of Al brizzi, the father of this lady, in furtherance of her views (though she had been married nearly twenty years, and had had a son by her hus band, who is a father of a family), came forward to declare that he had violated his daughter's inclinations ; by which declaration alone a ca tholic marriage can be dissolved. The father was nearly eighty years of age when his scru ples of conscience induced him to be the osten sible person thus to administer to his daughter's good fortune. The husband Marini, the hus band Albrizzi, the two sons, and the good lady, all live together in a state of the most profound miscellaneous harmony. She is a Greek ; is ambitious in her friendships ; a profound calcu lator ; and in every thing an extraordinary woman. Zorzetto Ricchi, the husband of the well known Cecilia Tron, is a native of Corfu. He"], [290, "250 VENICE. is an able politician ; has been an advocate for democracy as well as for imperialism ; and would become the meanest slave of Ali Pacha, for the sake of promotion and personal interest. No man sympathizes more in the successes of the weather-cock politicians of the day than Zorzetto does : for he runs no risk, and is sure to find that which he has not lost! Whenever he happens to be pushed for the needful, the Greek artfully invents some story of illness, or of hair breadth scapes from jeopardy, to soften the feelings of his better half. Promises of certain domestic duties towards her, and better beha viour for the future, generally end in softening the heart of the old lady. He does not live with her, but occupies the magnificent Palazzo- Tron, on the grand canal. The lady lives in private lodgings at Padua, where she is visited by her husband as often as his pecuniary neces sities call him thither. Eugenia Tron, the wife of the Bernabotti Giovanni Veronese, better known by the nick name of bocca storta, crook-mouthed, is a lady of some vivacity in repartee. Though disgust ingly ugly in the face, she possesses a remark ably fine figure. Being at a masked ball during carnival time, she was one night much followed, and particularly by a gentleman who was then"], [291, "251 VENICE. paying his addresses to the beautiful Cavaliera Donado, known by the name of \" la bella Veneziana.\" Having discovered whom he was following, she cried out to him, \" Lasciatela, e la bocca storta ;\" \" leave her, it is the crook mouthed lady.\" Hearing this, Eugenia Tron instantly replied, \" e vero che son brutta di viso ma egii sa che tengo un paradiso.\" And most assuredly she must have had some very powerful hidden charms ; for some of the handsomest young men in all Venice paid their assiduous court to her. Ludovico Priuli, M. A. Giustin gan, Tommassini, and many other elegant and fashionable men of rank, were constantly amongst the number of her admirers. She possessed a liberal, a generous, and a noble soul : even when reduced in her circumstances, she pre ferred living in a miserably obscure retirement, rather than become chargeable to her friends and former admirers. She has since retired to Corfu, where she possesses a baronia. Chiaretta Contarini was a perfect beauty, but a thorough-paced dunce. Though illiterate to a degree, she had a furious craving after the treasures of science. When at the public as semblies, or at the coffee-shops, she would call for \" un bicchier d'acqua corrotta,\" which means"], [292, "252 VENICE. a glass of water in mourning ; instead of \" un bicchier d'acqua corretta\" a glass of water cor rected, by having a little aniseed put into it ; which is a common beverage at Venice, simple water being in that country considered very unwholesome. She would also say she was going to the \" vigillatura,\" instead of \" ville giatura,\" and make a thousand blunders ofthe same kind. On one of her favourites, a French officer, being taken ill, she asked him to let her feel his pulse ; but, unfortunately, instead of saying \" laissez moi tater votre pouls,\" she said, \" laissez moi tater votre qu \u2014 .\" The officer said, it was not the custom in France, and politely begged to decline the proffered civility. Her little casino resembled a large sea-port town, and was open to bales of all descriptions, on payment of the transit duties. In the list of her numerous admirers, some of them men of talent, were Bianchi, and Carlo Pino, a Milanese, and brother of the general of that name. He was appointed by the Austrian Government at Venice, to be one of the justices ; as if there were not among the Venetians men capable of filling the situation ! Family intrigue procured him the place, and petticoat interest supported it.

Both Bianchi and Carlo Pino lived with Chiaretta in the same house. No ridiculous jealousies interrupted the harmony which sub sisted between the lawyer and the justice ; pro vided they shared in the spoils, they cared not \" if the general camp, pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body.\" They were too liberal minded to think of monopolizing so much beauty and virtue ; and therefore left the lady to in crease an influence, which, in the end, turned out to the profit ofthe trio. Chiaretta Contarini had three husbands, all living at the same time. The first was Dofiln, who, being poor, was either expelled or bought off by Grimani, a younger son of the family of that name. He was succeeded by the potent Contarini ; whom, however, Chiaretta survived, and she now resides at Milan. Being by nature yielding, liberal of her favours, and tolerant in her principles, men of all nations and religions are received by her with open arms.

She strived hard to get hold of some rich Jew of the Ghetto, and endeavoured to rival Marina Benzona in the good graces of the Cavalier Trevis ; but the fidelity of the Israelite remained unshaken. As soon as the above-mentioned Carlo Pino found the power of Buonaparte in Italy firmly established, he quitted the Austrian service at Venice, and repaired to his native home, to live with his long neglected wife and family. His brother, the general, being the war-minister, soon got him employed at Milan ; but having taken French leave of Chiaretta, and having given her, in an unguarded moment, a personal security of some magnitude, she soon followed him to enforce the payment of it. Not being able to comply therewith, and Chiaretta having, besides her pension of two livres a-day, collected together a small annuity, he persuaded her to take up her abode at Milan ; where, though advanced in years, she still continues to receive company; and where her conversation continues to be the same strange melange of blunder, wit, and detraction, that it was wont to be in her youthful days.

She has also lately written a little book, called \" Feste Vene ziane,\" in the composition of which she has resorted too much to her inventive faculties, and has trusted more to the brilliancy of her imagination than to the truth of history. She is a gay and lovely dame, and was, for a long time, the chere amie of an English gentleman of the name of Parr. She was formerly a very interesting little figure, and had a most engaging countenance ; but so negligent was she of her person, and so filthy in her dress, that she was more fitted to be the companion of Diogenes than of a well-bred Englishman. To her unpar donable neglect in these matters was this lively little creature indebted for the loss of her paramour ; who parted with her for one who was as ugly as sin, and who had no earthly virtue but the one in which his former Dulcinea was so deficient. This circumstance, added to the loss of hearing, have so changed her former character, that most of her intimate friends and acquaintances have forsaken her ; and, in con sequence thereof, she has followed the wise conduct of many a female, who, finding herself neglected by her lovers, returns to the embraces of her husband.

To such elderly dames may be applied what Pope says of Narcissa : \u2014 \" A very heathen in the carnal part, Yet still a sad, good Christian at her heart.\" Marina Benzona was the only Venetian lady who had the honour of being visited by the late Queen Caroline of England ; to whom, and to her suite, Marina gave an evening's entertain ment.

Venice was, at one time, the seat of music, and had established her conservatoires long be fore any other country had done so. The Men dicanti, and the Zitelle, and the Ospidaletto, were as famous for vocal as for instrumental performers. Their masters were the celebrated Bertoni, Bianchi, and Mayer ; and, in the Lent season, the oratorios were as well executed and as numerously attended, as those of any other city in Europe. None of the natives of Italy have a more refined musical taste than the Venetians. Pac chierotti, with all his defects, was enchanting, whenever he happened to sing in tune, as he always addressed himself to the heart ; while Marchesi, with ten times his ability and natural gifts, often disgusted, in consequence of his vol. i. s"], [298, "258 VENICE. deviations from that nature, the want of which Pacchierotti contrived to supply, by a re finement of art, which no other singer, male or female, has hitherto been able to attain. His habit of singing below pitch did not arise from want of ear, or of musical science, but from excessive sensibility, whereby his me- taphysical powers often got the better of his physical \u2014 a circumstance which is rarely or never the case with the musical professors of the north, who, in general, sing in too sharp a key, from their want of ear as well as of feeling. It is certainly most desirable to be perfectly in tune ; but the singing in too flat a key depends on numerous physical causes, which produce the effect of imperfect intonation, and proceeds not uncommonly from weakness of the lungs or chest. In short, the human voice is of so deli- cate a nature, that every trifling thing that mili- tates against the health is prejudicial to it. It is the height of folly in singers to fancy that the use of one particular liquid can be more ser- viceable than the use of another. Nothing on earth will preserve the voice ; though the abuse of any thing may tend greatly to destroy it. A regular course of diet, accompanied with mode rate exercise, is all that is required. It is, how ever, what few persons who have attained any"], [299, "VENICE. 259 celebrity in that elegant and most fascinating science, sufficiently attend to. It seems, indeed, as if nature had bestowed this valuable gift on the most abject of her creatures. The moment those miserable beings, who may be said to belong to neither gender, and whom I know not under what description of animals to classify \u2014 the moment they are pronounced duly qualified, they are taught mu sic, though ignorant of every other social accom plishment. In that science they become pro ficients ; but, in every thing else these castrati gentlemen are little better than brutes. It is, however, a well attested fact, that Mrs. Conway, the Princess Albani, Annetta Brignole, Chia retta Contarini, the Grassini, and many other females, were prodigiously attached to Mar chesi. The crime, however, carries its own punishment along with it ! Deprived, in early life, of the advantages of a liberal education, the animals of which I have been speaking, the moment good fortune calls them into public notice, puffed up by the applauses lavished on their superficial capacities, are found deficient of those prin ciples and those virtues, by which every other class of human beings is distinguished. There is, however, no rule without an exception. Some t 2"], [300, "260 VENICE. few of them have been found who were capable of reading their parts ; especially the children of professional parents, who had taught them at least the science of music, whereby they have been enabled to secure to themselves a com fortable subsistence in their old age. Pacchierotti was one of the best educated singers in all Italy, and had associated in early life with men of letters. Rubinelli had good natural abilities, and was very grateful to the English, for the encouragement he met with while in this country. Aprilli was quite the gentleman in public society, except when he spoke on music, and thereby instantly dis covered himself to be of the neuter gender. Crescentini, who was a close imitator of Pac chierotti, was also an excellent musico. Sene sino and Damiani, who ranked amongst the second class of these beings, always sang in tune, and with infinitely more judgment than Marchesi ; who, for the sake of a roulade, would sacrifice the finest poetical sentiment of the great Metastasio. Crescentini is also said to have been very liberal. He made the Grassini a present of a valuable diamond ring, when she sang with him at Venice, in the opera of the Orazii and Curiazzii ; and it is reported that it was in consequence of some such weighty rea-"], [301, "261 VENICE. son, that she was induced to interest herself with Napoleon, to give him the order of the Iron Cross. In one style of singing Madame Mara, and in another Mrs. Billington, not only excelled all who had gone before them, but every one of their contemporaries, as well as every one who has come after them. As our English favourite, poor Mrs. Bland, once justly observed, \"they are all mere school-girls to them.\" Being one night at Mr. Bochsa's oratorios, and hearing one of the present race of singers execute some of her favourite songs, Madame Mara was asked by a friend who was sitting with her in the same box, what she thought of her? \" She dances a tolerably good fandango,\" was her answer ; and it was, I think, as severe a slap at the judgment of the audience, and at the mediocrity of the singer, as can be well conceived. There is a certain Italian female, possessing, un doubtedly, some pretensions to natural abilities, who had the good fortune to come to England when the two great singers I have just men tioned, were on the decline, and when the war left her field-marshal of the musical forces. The French say, that \" Madame bat les \u0153ufs, et Monsieur son epoux fait l'omelette:\" and this is s 3"], [302, "262 VENICE. certainly true; forno pastry-cook evermade more puffs, or paid more for newspaper panegyrics than this \" great lady in the little parlour\" has done. When last in Italy, she used to make a boast, that his present Majesty, when Prince Regent, would take her under his arm, and conduct her to the tea-parties of his mother, the late Queen Charlotte, and those of his sisters, the Princesses. The royal family of Bavaria were not, however, quite so conde scending to this companion of English royalty ; for they gave directions that the lady, bedizened with diamonds, as well as her husband, Signor Bragone, should be turned out of a box, which, in her presumption, she had taken possession of, a little too near to the one occupied by the royal family. For this mortification of her vanity she has only herself to blame ; since, both the King and Queen of Bavaria are distinguished for their affability and kindness towards all professional persons \u2014 provided those persons keep their proper places. This singer lost an engagement at the theatre of the Fenice at Venice for the present Carnival, in consequence of a trifling mistake which her French husband made in his calculations. Fan cying that if his spouse was engaged to sing at Venice, all the post horses on the high-roads"], [303, "263 VENICE. leading to that city would be in a state of re quisition, for the purpose of conveying the different sovereigns of Europe, and the treasures that would be expended at the theatre on the occasion, modestly proposed to the managers, that they should share the same with his wife, half and half. The question was put to the vote ; when, out of the fifty proprietors of the theatre at Venice, eight-and-forty black-balled the Frenchman's impudent proposition \u2014 there by inflicting a just punishment on inordinate presumption ! I have too great a reverence for the works of the Supreme Being not to esteem merit, in whatever shape it presents itself; but I must say, that I think that that merit loses much of its charm, when it is found united to vanity and avarice. Justice, however, compels me to declare, that this singer, like some of our own admired ac tresses, is untainted in her private character. But, the pride of some ofthe musical foreigners, who pay their visits to John Bull, ought to be hum bled ; and especially the pride of this lady, whose star has certainly shone more propi tiously in this our northern climate, than it ever did in her own, or in any other country. t 4"], [304, "264 VENICE. How different in disposition, and, alas, in con duct, was our incomparable warbler Mrs. Bil lington! As the following anecdotes of this celebrated singer convey, to my mind, a not uninstructive lesson to such of my fair country women as may be in possession of this most fascinating, as well as most dangerous, of all God's gifts, when unaccompanied by good con duct, I shall introduce them into the present chapter. Mrs. Billington came to Naples in the year 1794, accompanied by her husband, a double bass player, and her brother Charles Weischell, the famous performer on the violin. She was soon engaged to sing at the theatre San Carlo ; andon her account Signor Bianchi was instructed to set to music the opera of Ines di Castro ; into which, in consequence of her defective memory, she instructed him to introduce a favourite song, which she had for years been giving in London, composed by Salicri. Bianchi complied with her request, but added thereto a few bars and three cadenzas, in order that she might change them in the course of the opera ; Cimarosa also wrote three ; the German composer, Hermil, added three more ; while Marescalche, one of the orchestra, and a music seller, likewise contri-"], [305, "265 VENICE. buted three ; making up amongst them a round dozen, all of them obligatos, which she was to sing, accompanied by her brother the violinist. It will scarcely be credited, that this most skilful singer possessed so little nature and so much science, that she actually began the Car nival with the first cadenza, and ended it, with out varying a note during the whole time. Whatever she had determined on doing, she executed to the greatest perfection ; but in point of genius, and at variations, or at an im promptu, she was a mere dunce, and, in every respect, what the Italians call una testa dura. Mrs. Billington had not been long at Naples before she attracted the attention of princes, dukes, barons, counts, and commoners. Her amazing musical powers, with her great per sonal charms, and the facility with which those charms were yielded up, and perhaps for the first time opposed by her hitherto complaisant husband, gave birth to a rumour of his having been carried off by poison. The occasion of it was this. On the second day of her first engagement at the theatre San Carlo, after she and Mr. Bil lington had been dining with an English family who were lodging in the same hotel, he went up stairs to fetch the cloak in which she was"], [306, "266 VENICE. about to go to the theatre, when, while in the act of putting it on her shoulders, without uttering a syllable, he dropped down at her feet, and expired ! Great suspicions were entertained that this sudden event had been occasioned by poison ; but, the characters both of Mr. and Mrs. Bil lington were too well established in the world of gallantry, to render the supposition that the husband, through jealousy, had taken poison, credible, or that the wife had administered the potion for the sake of gratifying her passions ad libitum. No, no ! Mr. and Mrs. Billington understood each other's necessities far better ! The easy compliances ofthe lady were too pro fitable to the fiddler, to render such a result probable. Mrs. Billington, however, soon consoled her self for the loss of her double-bass husband, in the arms of those who performed more to her satisfaction on the strings of her heart, not only during the remainder of her stay at Naples, but in every town which she visited. Her vast musical talents, added to her nightly personal fame, never failed to furnish her with what the French call de grande pratique. Lovers, ad mirers, cavalieri servanti, were accepted by her and dismissed, as easily as fashions are taken up"], [307, "267 VENICE. and laid down, according as inclination, or rea sons of a more solid nature, happened to pre dominate. Happily for the public at large, no individual occupied her undivided attention, until, by a turn of the wheel of fortune, she found herself engaged at the theatre della Scala at Milan. Here it was that Mrs. Bil lington got acquainted with a fellow of the name of Filisan, a native of Lyons, who had, it is said, been one of the active murderous agents, employed against the unfortunate nobi lity, who fell by wholesale in the Place du bel Course of that city, by cannon a la mitraille ; it being then thought more expeditious, as it was at a time of the year when the days were getting short, and at a period when the blood-hounds had a deal of business on their hands, to fire on the wretched victims of revolutionary phrenzy in groups, than to dispatch them separately by the sainte guillotine. The work of slaughter being at length ac complished, Filisan followed the army of cut throats to Italy, and arrived with it at Milan, in the capacity of a garde-magasin. Being in the prime of youth, possessing a fine athletic figure and other personal advantages, he soon got introduced to the company of ihejilles des menus plaisirs, who formed the corps de ballet ;"], [308, "268 VENICE. and, step by step, he ingratiated himself into the society of the principal dancers at the theatre della Scala, and amongst the rest into the society of the Zerbi, a lady who was at that time as celebrated for her feats on the \" light fantastic toe,\" as she was for the liberality with which she dispensed her personal favours; and who afterwards, though a woman of the lowest extraction, and the sister of a sbirro, became the wife of Alvise Manin, nephew to the last Doge of Venice : whom, by the bye, she has ruined by her extravagance. Finding, however, that her connection with Filisan was unfavourable to her private specu lations, and having also, on sundry occasions, felt the weight of his massy fist on her slender and elegant shoulders, and the nimbleness of his fingers in her pockets, whenever she brought home her earnings from the theatre, she thought proper to discard from her favour a man, whom she found intent on gratifying his amour propre at the expense of her professional labours. In this unsatisfactory state of his affairs Filisan cast his eyes about, and at last fixed them on Mrs. Billington, who was then singing at the same theatre ; and, so well did the wary French man play his part, that in a very short time the lady became Madame Filisan, to the great as-"], [309, "269 VENICE. tonishment as well as regret of all her real friends ; for the fellow's finances were at that time in so deplorable a state, notwithstanding his filchings from the Zerbi, and his gambling speculations, that, on the day of his wedding, he was scarcely possessed of a second shirt : at least, such is the story which Mrs. Billington herself told to Sarah, her cousin, who lived with her from the time she left England, in the capacity of a menial servant. Being thus raised from a state of misery and wretchedness to one of comparative affluence, Filisan now dressed himself out in an elegant French uniform, and Mrs. Billington caused it to be reported, that she had purchased him a commission, which entitled him to wear it. This, however, was not the case. In a short time after her marriage, the poor lady had bitter cause to lament the step she had taken. Her face and arms exhibited constant proofs of the Frenchman's pugnacious powers ; even before the honey-moon had expired. Jus tice, however, speedily overtook him. For his impudence in wearing the French uniform, and for his other fourberies, he was publicly flogged, in St. Mark's Place, at Venice, by order of General Serrurier ; and banishment would have followed, had it not been for the interference"], [310, "270 VENICE. of Giuseppe Alcaini, the gentleman at whose house Mrs. Billington lodged. This Signor Alcaini was father to the bishop and general of that name, and had been a famous man at the bar ; probably the only one who shone unrivalled at the forum Veneta for so long a period. It was his greatest ambition to entertain at his splendid house and sumptuous table, the prime donne of any celebrity, during the time of their performing at Venice. Mrs. Billington being a lively, pleasant woman, might have remained there as long as she chose ; but, as her French maitre de magasin was obliged to leave it, she thought proper to go with him to Treviso, where she purchased a country-house of the patrician Giovanni Veronese, at San Artien. No sooner was she settled in it, than Filisan began repairing the old house, from top to bot tom ; and, for fear his spouse should decamp, as her brother and her cousin Sarah had done, he always forced her to accompany him, in an open cart, to buy planks, and bricks, and mortar, and sand, and every other material necessary for building. He obliged her to wear the coarsest garments, and never suffered her to put on a gown that cost more than two or three Venetian livres a yard. At their meals no cloth was ever put on the table ; and, instead of using a knife"], [311, "271 VENICE. and fork, he would tear a fowl or a duck in pieces with his filthy fingers. The house in which they lived adjoined that of the patrician Cornaro, which, by means of an hydraulic machine, is surrounded with water as pure as crystal. One day, in his passion, the savage got hold of his wife, and swore he would drown her, unless she surrendered to him her jewels. To save her life, the unfortunate songstress com plied ; but never after were they returned to her. At last, beholding the horrible condition to which she was reduced by the brutal conduct of her husband, she one evening took French leave, almost en chemise, joined her brother at Venice, and set off with him for England. Here she met with that reception as a singer which her great talents entitled her to ; and hither her wretch of a husband had the audacity to follow her : but, as she was constantly under the protection of some cher ami or other, the first on the list being then the Duke of P , a minister of state ; as soon as Filisan presented himself at the theatre, as the husband of Mrs. Billington, for the purpose of receiving her salary, which was all he wanted, she had him instantly arrested ; and he was afterwards, by order, as it is said, of the above-mentioned"], [312, "VENICE. 272 Duke, justly sent out of the country, by virtue ofthe alien act. Filisan returned to San Artien, vowing ven geance against England, and the whole English nation. Notwithstanding, however, all that Mrs. Billington had been made to suffer from this ruffian, and her knowledge that he was living with women of his own stamp, she often sent him money and presents from England ; and, after a separation of fifteen years, actually went back to him ! \" Frailty, thy name is woman !\" The ex cuse which she gave to an English lady, for her folly in returning to such a monster, was her fear, that she might become the victim of her princely paramour, as a great comic actress of the day was reported to have been. To save what she had collected together from the grasp of her regal favourite, she wrote to her husband to come to England to fetch her. He assented ; on condition that she made over to him every thing she possessed. This being complied with, Filisan re-visited this country under more fa vourable auspices than he had before done, and Mrs. Billington returned with him to Italy, taking with her a natural daughter, whom it is said she had had by an Englishman of the name of Mad-"], [313, "273 V E N I C E. docks. She had not been long at San Artien before her ruffian of a husband began his fistic operations upon her, and, on one of these oc casions, so severe were the bruises she re ceived, that from that day she took to her bed, and never rose from it alive ! Having thus got rid of his wife, Filisan's next step was to send the girl who went by the name of Maddocks to a convent, from a notion which had got into his head, that she was a child that Mrs. Billington had had by the philanthropic Duke of Sussex, and that if he could contrive to marry her himself, he stood a chance of get ting a good fortune with her. In which golden dreams, however, he was, luckily for the object of them, foiled, by some individuals in Eng land writing to the government, and getting the young lady, through the agency of the physician Aglietti, released from the convent and sent over to this country. vol. 1.

From that time, I never saw Madame Le Clerc, except accidentally on my return from Spain, in my way to Italy, when 1 again met her at Marseilles, where she had just arrived, with the body of her husband, who had died at St. Domingo ; and sometime afterwards at Rome, when she had become the Princess Borghese. But she was then so much altered, as scarcely to be recognized ; for, at the time of"], [317, "277 V E N I C E. her marriage to her first husband, she was really a most beautiful woman. As I have mentioned the sumptuous dejeune given by Buonaparte at the palace Serbelloni, on the marriage of his sister, I shall here take occasion to express the astonishment I have often felt, that this Corsican family should have been so uncommonly extravagant, seeing that not a soul of them had ever before been in affluent circumstances. At the Hotel di Belvidere, where I resided, I found that one of the waiters had been ser vant to Buonaparte, during the siege of Tou lon, when his propitious star first shone upon his early exploits. At that time, he was so exces sively poor and friendless, that he and his man often could not scrape together a sum suffi ciently large to allow them to engage any other conveyance, from Marseilles to Toulon, than a single horse between them, and frer quently they were obliged to go on foot, for want of that useful commodity which is said to \" make the mare to go.\" This man also accompanied Buonaparte to Paris, and continued in his service until he embarked for Egypt. He declared to me, that he had often heard his master say, \" I must positively quit Paris and France for some little t3"], [318, "278 V \u00a3 N 1CK. time, or I sball meet with the fate that befel the Scipios : those two warriors were the greatest men Rome ever possessed : their sta tues were worshipped, and placed amongst those of their gods in the Pantheon, upon cushions ; but they lost all their popularity with the Romans, by appearing too often be fore them.\" To this policy it may be attri buted, that Buonaparte was induced to under take the command of that most extraordinary expedition. It was at the sumptuous de/e4ne, given at the palazzo Serbelloni, on the occasion of the marriage of his sister Paulina to General Le Clerc, that the violation of the Venetian ter ritory was determined on by Buonaparte. It was, however, necessary for him to proceed with every possible degree of caution, so as not openly to insult the hospitality of the Ve netians ; as the PYench army, at that time, were actually maintained by the very govern ment, whose destruction had been irrevocably fixed. To accomplish this destruction, Salicetti was directed to prepare some hundreds of peasants' dresses ; which dresses were distributed amongst the men and officers; and under this disguise were Bergamo and Brescia invaded, in concert with"], [319, "279 VENICE. the Lecchis and a few turbulent and disaffected characters, so as to make it appear to the go vernment at Venice, that the dismemberment of these two rich provinces had been the effect of a general and voluntary effort, on the part of the people, to get rid of their former mild government, and unite themselves with that of the Cisalpine. Remonstrance, on the part of the Venetian government, was useless, and of no weight in the scale of republican equity and justice. The die had been cast by Buonaparte. Those places were now to be separated for ever from the Venetian territory. On this occasion, the noble Alvise Quirini was sent ambassador extraordinary to Paris, to complain of this violation of their well-known neutrality and continued hospitality ; notwith standing the large sum advanced for the me diation of Barras with the other directors, for a further continuance of the Venetian neu trality and independence. On his arrival at his hotel, he found an order for him instantly to quit Paris, as Venice had, in the interim, been revolutionized ; though the sum of money to be paid, had been actually anticipated ; and the contributions levied by Buonaparte had been generally agreed to. t 4"], [320, "280 V E N I C E. In this state were the negociations, when Buonaparte took possession of Verona, in open violation of all law, human and divine. And, what merit, I ask, could attach to a geueral, or to his army, for acting thus towards a friendly power, unprepared for resistance, ex cept in the affections of its subjects, in an open country, against an unarmed population, and an unfortified city ; whose inhabitants were cruelly plundered and massacred ? Many of the poor defenceless people of Verona were barbarously executed by the dastardly French, on their becoming masters of the Ve netian states ; but, the noble resistance which they made sufficiently demonstrates, that their affection and love for their legitimate govern ment, would have proved a powerful barrier against French aggression, had they been sup plied with arms. But, from the fatal want of them, they were brutally butchered and treated as rebels, for having defended themselves, to the best of their power, against the invasion of a foreign enemy, who was indebted millions to the Venetian government, and whose armies must have perished, but for the supplies which that government had generously afforded them ! Such members of the Venetian government as had not time, or were not disposed, to aban-"], [321, "V E N I C Fa. 281 don their situations and the trust reposed in them, by quitting Verona for Venice, were seized as hostages for the due fulfilment of the contract negociated at Paris ; though the go vernment no longer existed. Many persons at Verona were tried by a military court martial and shot. Amongst others, was my most par ticular friend Count Augustin Verita, who left behind him a young and beloved wife and child to deplore his melancholy fate. Ambassadors, commissioners, nobles, persons of all ranks and stations, were sent from Venice to Verona, and, vice versd, form Verona to Venice : but the Pacha Buonaparte was inexorable, and not to be diverted from his plan of general devastation ; and Venice, like the rest of Italy, was not to be exempt from the despotism of this unfeeling dictator! And, for all this accumulated affliction were the Venetians indebted to their own cre dulity, and to the hypocritical projects of the Corsican upstart ! The base pretence set up by Buonaparte for his hostility towards the Venetians, and for sacrile giously entering their territories, was, that the Veronese, headed by Count Augustin Verita, had inhumanly forced their way into the French hospitals, and had there massacred the sick and wounded of his army !"], [322, "282 V E N I C E. Now, had this even been the case, what right had he to make the whole nation, or its government, responsible for the act of an individual ? This, however, was not the case ; as has been proved, beyond the shadow of a doubt : it is, however, of a piece with all the foul deeds of treachery performed by Buonaparte for the overthrow of the Venetian government. The above-men tioned unheard-of calumny was the sheer in vention of his own brain. Not being able to discover traitors among the Venetians, he had recourse to this low and infamous subterfuge, in order to palliate his want of feeling for his own sick and wounded, who were dying every where like rotten sheep, for the want of medical assistance, and for lack of the common neces saries of life. For Buonaparte had little or no care for any of his men, when they could no longer be of service to him in the field of bat tle. He then most philosophically considered them an incumbrance, which it was desirable to get rid of. As \" dead men tell no tales,\" many a vile perpetrator of his foul orders has fallen a victim to his own misdeeds, to avoid discovery. By some of them, however, who were lucky enough to escape the just reward that awaited their bloody deeds, the real facts have been brought to light ; and those facts completely"], [323, "VENICE. 283 exonerate the Venetian government of the foul crime laid to their charge by the unprincipled invader. Besides, if the Venetian government!) ad really wished to destroy the French army, it would never, from mere motives of humanity, have maintained that army, for a considerable time, in the Terra Firma ; since, by doing so, it ac tually committed a violation of its neutrality, as it regarded Austria. For at that time, from the depredations and plunderings of the French army, the people of the different provinces were so incensed against them, that they only wanted the word of command, for every man of them to have risen en masse. This I well remember, that in accompany ing some persons who were going to Milan, for the purpose of regulating the excise and customs duties, on passing through Bergamo and Brescia, we were surrounded by the whole population, who exclaimed to one of the pa tricians, who was with us in the carriage, \" What is the republic about ? what does the sluggish senate mean by all this inactivity ? are we to be sacrificed like sheep, and slaughtered by the French butchers?\" But, alas, alas, instead of putting arms into their hands, and animating them to a general"], [324, "284 v 1; N I C E. defence of the state, they were exhorted to act with the greatest prudence \u2014 least, forsooth, they should give General Buonaparte and his army cause to complain ! O, fallacious policy ! O, unwise forbearance ! Thus were the poor people lulled into a state of apathy, until the Corsican invader, discovering their inviolable attachment to their government, and tired of acting the hypocrite any longer, revolutionized both Bergamo and Brescia ! While these things were going on, the Ge noese were secretly enjoying the destruction of their ancient rivals, the Venetians ; never once recollecting the good old proverb \u2014 \" Ho die mihi, eras tibi.\" And here I must be al lowed to repeat, what I have before so strenu ously urged ; namely, that Italy would never have been conquered by the French or by the Austrians, if the whole of that country had been opposed to the enemy. The policy which has fatally prevailed, has been to keep the Ita lians constantly at variance amongst them selves; and we well know, from the highest authority, that \" a house divided against itself cannot stand :\" but Buonaparte, by disguising his real intentions, and by professing the oppo site of that which he intended to perform, con trived to make them individually hate each"], [325, "285 V E N I c ]\u2022;. other ; and by so doing did he more completely throw Italy into a state of division, than any other conqueror had done. Alvise Quirini being returned from his em bassy to Paris, Buonaparte, in the month of June 1796, at a small hovel in the town of Mestre, directed, nay commanded, the im prisonment of the three Inquisitors of State ; and, as soon as his fiat had been obeyed, the sham democratic republic was installed in their room. The respected names of Pisani, of Dolfin, of Cornaro, of Ferro, and of Mocenego, were dishonoured, degraded, polluted, by the infamous wretches with whom they were now associated ! But, all the men of birth, of rank, and of probity, who, from their bond fide love of reform, had unfortunately been led astray from the path of duty, were soon convinced, that such an olio spagnuolo could not long con tinue ; and many of them declined the honour of serving their country, in company with the rebels who had been chosen by Buonaparte. But, here follows another Corsican stratagem, more atrocious, if possible, than all the rest Will it be credited, that, during the whole of this time, Buonaparte had been negociating the sale of the Venetian States to Austria? for whilst the man\u0153uvres, and the murders, and"], [326, "286 VENICE. the butcherings, were committing at Vero na, that ginger-bread compact, the peace of Campo Formio took place, in the course of which the above states were actually bargained away ! The comedy of errors was, however, still kept up in all its scenes ; until at last the curtain dropped, and convinced the Venetians, as well as all Italy, that they had been perform ing the prominent parts of folly and of imbe cility, which distinguished the sad tragedy. Though Buonaparte at first insisted, that per- sons taken out of the lowest class should form the major portion in the new mock-government, he, nevertheless, when it was proposed that some of these mushroom members of his own creation should be sent to him at Campo Por- mio \u2014 (for he still kept up the farce of making the Venetian democrats believe that he was treating for their independence, thougli Austria had concluded the contract, whereby she was to receive the Venetian States as a compensa- tion for the Low Countries) \u2014 he rejected the rebel deputies with disdain, as he no longer stood in need of their assistance, and insisted, that two noble Venetians, as had been the cus tom, should be sent thither, with Lavezzari, the secretary of the late senate, at their head ; who had, for many years, been the resident"], [327, "287 VENICE. minister of the republic, at the Court of London. It is to the said Lavezzari, between whom and myself there existed a long and uninter rupted friendship, that I am indebted for many of the anecdotes recorded in the present work. My friend had strongly disapproved of the impolitic conduct of his government, in re fusing the generous offer of England, made in the year 1793, and repeated on the first invasion of the Italian territory by the French, of supplying the republic with men, with money, and with ships, for the purpose of protecting the Adriatic. But, all the argu ments he could make use of, founded on deep knowledge acquired by a long and skilful diplo matic career, were over-ruled by Bataja and Francesco Pesaro. Buonaparte, however, never had the courage to come to Venice, until after he had been dubbed \" Imperatore.\" Shortly after he as sumed that title, he added thereto that of \" Altissimo,\" whicli gave rise to the following jeu d'esprit on the two emperors \u2014 \" L' Altissimo di sit ci manda la tempesta, L' Altissimo di giu cimangia quai che resta : Fra questi due Altissimi Noi ifstiamo poverissimi"], [328, "288 VENICE. The contributions levied by Buonaparte at Venice, on his newly bought and newly sold slaves, were enormous. The statues, the ma nuscripts, the public library, the paintings, the shipping, were seized. The vessels in the arsenal, and a great part of the buildings, were destroyed ; together with the famous Bucen toro, or galley, in which the Doge, on the feast of the Ascension, used to go, accompa nied by a great number of the patricians, to marry the Adriatic ; and a description of which vessel I have already given. As soon as the government had been suffi ciently democratized, Madame Josephine Buo naparte made her appearance at Venice, in the place of her lord and master, attended by all the revolutionary demireps of her party. The only Venetian noble lady who paid her any particular attention was Cecilia Tron, at tended by her friend Annetta Vadori, and her democratical husband Zorzi Richi."], [329, "289 CHAPTER XXVI.

The populace of Venice supported the loss of all the beautiful works of art with a most philosophical indifference, until they saw the preparations which were making, at the door of St. Mark's Church, to take down the four famous horses, brought from Constantinople by the Venetians, when they conquered that city, and of which I have elsewhere spoken. The sight of what was going on occasioned a deep national sensation ; and, if there had been at that precise moment, any manly spirit ready vol. i. v"], [330, "290 VENICE. to head the populace, a revolt would inevitably have taken place. But their once leading men had been deprived of their property ; and with that property had fled their former manly spirit of resistance. So true is it, that \" L'uomo senza pecunia e l'immagine della morte.\" The people, therefore, made a merit of necessity, and suffered the French to proceed unmolested in the work of taking down these invaluable ornaments of their once famous city. No Ve netian labourer could, however, be found to assist them in the work of national robbery ; and the whole populace attended the embarka tion of the four steeds, as they would have at tended the body of a revered friend to the grave. Had St. Mark's Place and the great tower been moveable, the French would have carried them off, amidst the cries of \" Viva la liberta et l'egualianza ; chi non ruba non impiegnisce la panza.\" In the Terra Firma, they plun dered the several Monte di Pieta ; which were establishments similar to our pawnbrokers' shops ; and thereby was occasioned the ruin of thousands of honest and respectable fa milies. PYom Venice Madame Josephine and her precious train of democratical trollops passed"], [331, "291 VENICE. to the Terra Firma, where they made it a con stant practice, as they had before done at Ve nice, to take every thing they had an inclina tion to, without paying for it. They never waited for an invitation, but visited wherever they pleased. Amongst the rest, Merini, the Bishop of Treviso, was obliged to entertain them at dinner ; in the course of which the old man caught a horrid fit ofthe gout in his hand, from a cold occasioned by the loss of a large, beautiful, and valuable ring, which Josephine had thought proper to take from his fingers; but which, unfortunately, she forgot to return. The poor bishop had but slender hopes of being made a cardinal ; for at that time the title was out of fashion, and he died before the religious farce was brought upon the political boards. Upon the above occasion, the Vene tians were accustomed to observe, \" I Fran cesi fanni molto uso del verbo avere, ma quello del verbo dare non hanno nel loro vocabu lario.\" When Buonaparte and the French army en tered Bologna, Mrs. Billington happened to be singing at the opera ; and, so terrified was she, that she refused to perform. Upon hear ing this, the Hero of Italy ordered her to come to him in his box, and he there assured V 2"], [332, "292 VENICE. her, she had nothing to fear from him, as he \" never was at war with the fair sex.\" He nevertheless thought proper to arrest Mrs. Watson, the English Consul's wife, and had her dragged about, from place to place, for eight years, as a prisoner of war. He treated Mrs. Spencer Smith in the same manner, as well as another English lady at Venice; The former was arrested, by Buonaparte's order, immediately on the French coining to Venice ; the other two, while he was in Russia. One of them had resided in Venice twenty years, and was married to a Venetian. In short, the whole life of this man was a continued series of contradictions ; but the greatest of all was, perhaps, the surrendering himself up to the English, whom he absolutely detested, and whom he had always described as a nation of pirates \u2014 \" Cette nation doit etre ecrasee,\" was an expression he was accustomed to make use of, whenever the great man happened to be thwarted by the British government, in any of his \" grandes pensees.\" I have mentioned Madame Cecilia Tron, as being the only Venetian noble lady, who paid Josephine any particular attention. Her reason for so doing was briefly this : she had at the time a lover of the name of Zorzi Richi, a"], [333, "293 VENICE. Greek and a native of Corfu, whom she after wards married. For this animal, who was the ne plus ultra of a Jacobin, Cecilia was extremely anxious to procure some appointment under the new government, and on this account was she induced to pay court to this female fox under the garb of a lamb. Nor was Cecilia unsuc cessful in her application to the Cisalpin rege neratrice, for Zorzi, sure enough, became one ofthe nouveaux employes; and, rather than have his name left out of the list, the brute would submit to have been made a night-man ; for \" charity begins at home,\" was Zorzi's favourite motto ; and he had moreover a prodigious attach ment to tlie Agrarian law with regard to pro perty, in the expectation of securing a few acres for himself. But, in the midst of the democratical exhibi tions which Cecilia Tron gave at her palace on the Grand Canal, she could not, I think, help sometimes comparing her then situation, with the honours which she had once received from the hands of the Emperor, Joseph the Second, and contrasting the manners and habits of her then raggamuffin guests, with those of the distinguished individuals who formerly attended her delightful parties, at the times when that u 3"], [334, "294 VENICE. monarch, whose letters she was accustomed so highly to extol, visited her, during his stay at Venice. And never, surely, was there such an * in dependent \" government, as the republican one, which Buonaparte, in his loving kindness, had carved out for the poor Cisalpins ! At the head of all their public decrees, in large letters, stood these words : \" For the honour and inde pendence of the infant Cisalpin Republic, the affectionate and loving Republic of France, orders and commands,\" &c. &c. I can never think of the conduct of Buona parte towards the people of Italy, but it re minds me of the sort of \" independence\" which he promised to father and son, when the un happy differences broke out between Charles the Fourth and his hopeful boy, the present right dearly \" beloved \" Ferdinand of Spain. Woe to that sovereign, to that family, or to that nation, who shall submit to have their private, or their public, differences settled by a foreigner! By so doing, they forfeit every claim to domes tic tranquillity, and bid a lasting adieu to that mutual confidence, which, when once destroyed, can never be restored ; and produce that precise state of things, which must either terminate in"], [335, "295 VENICE. the triumph of one of the parties, or in both of them becoming the slaves of a foreign inter ference. Thus was it with the above individuals, when Buonaparte seduced father and son to quit their own dominions. Finding both of them to be in the wrong, from their inability to do that which was right, he cunningly contrived to make them both equally culpable, and both equally unworthy of reigning, when those wise- v acres of princes called him in to be the umpire in their disputes; and when, for the \"honour and the independence \" of Spain, as he had before done for the \" honour and the independence\" of the Cisalpins, he had \" ordered \" and \" com manded \" father, mother, son, brother, and lover to relinquish their authority \u2014 a command, which they never would have been forced to obey, had they been as much united for the public good, as they were divided in their se veral views. By an overwhelming stretch of power, a nation may, for a while, be conquered ; but never can it be subdued, without the entire extermination of its inhabitants \u2014 in which case, it would not be worth possessing. But the people of Spain, I venture to assert \u2014 and I do it after much reflection and considera tion \u2014 are at least a century behind the rest of u 4"], [336, "296 VENICE. the natives of Europe, in point of civilization. They are neither so rich, nor so valiant, nor so generous, as people have imagined them to be. A bigotry which borders more on idolatry than it does on religion ; and a superstition which is the offspring of gross, and palpable, and almost tangible ignorance, must, and ever will, have the inevitable effect of retarding the general improvement ofthe human species. To apply this to the present state of Spain. If we take a sober and impartial review of their recent conduct, we shall find them to be a race of mortals, differing from every other nation ; and especially that portion of them which be long to the old stock of Grandees. To me they appear to be the very outcasts of human manufactory : they seem to have been formed in a different mould from that of the rest of their fellow creatures. I scarcely ever recollect see ing one of them, who was not marked in the countenance like the Pharisee who gave our Saviour the sacrilegious slap ; who was not hunch-backed, or had crooked or ricketty legs ; or who had not an immensely large squat body, with a little round head tottering on a short neck ; like the Chinese figures which one sees at all the tea-shops nodding for customers, or the figure of punch running upon rollers."], [337, "297 VENICE. Of all people on earth, the Spaniards are the most lazy, the most lousy, the most filthy, the most ignorant, the most savage, the most cruel, and the most implacable in their hatred towards all other nations; but especially towards the French, for whom they have an unconquer able, a deadly, aversion, and whose language is even less known amongst them, than it is in any village in Russia. On the arrival in Spain of the Crown Prince of Naples, with the princess his sister \u2014 who was the first wife of the present king, and whose sister was destined to be the wife of the said prince of Naples \u2014 when they alighted at Barce lona, at the palace prepared for their reception, they had more than half an hour to wait, before they could procure a glass of water ; for there was not a servant who understood French, Italian, German, or English. Nearly the same thing took place with the ladies who were about to be presented to the Queen of Charles the Fourth. They were intro duced to an old, squat, punchy figure, with her head nodding backwards and forwards, dressed in a hoop-petticoat, much wider than the little body was long, with ruffles at her elbows reach ing down to her high-heeled shoes ; on her head was a wide cap, covered with lace, a soot and"], [338, "298 VENICE. a half higher than her toupee, which was combed smooth over a black roller ; and, added to the whole, was a complexion more resembling a rotten olive, or fried oil, than the human skin. All we could get out of this \" model of divine perfection,\" was \" Nada, nada ; non intendo auste :\" and, if it had not been for one of the foreign ambassadors, who conducted us to the ambassador of the country to which we respec tively belonged, old \" Nada \" would have \" nada'd \" us till the day of resurrection ; and when the Queen told her our business for the next presentation to the princess, she turned round like a whipping top, laughed like a Che rokee, and shewed her teeth like a monkey ; which said teeth, one in and one out, resembled, for all the world, the old rusty bars of a prison. There was not a single carriage belonging to the royal family, that had any other harness than ropes ; excepting one, which belonged to the Queen, and a chariot, which was the pro perty of the then all-powerful and infamous Godoi, the Prince of Peace ; whose anti-chamber for reception of the Grandees was at the head of the stair-case ; and when he saw me he politely conducted me by the hand to the pre sence chamber of his levee ; and as politely shut the door in their faces. He neither spoke,"], [339, "Venice. 299 nor understood, any tongue except Spanish. Of course, my conversation with him was of a very limited nature, as I was but scantily ac quainted with the idiom of that language ; but Massaredo and Gravina were kind enough to explain to me the Prince's civilities. In short, I quitted Spain with less regret than I ever quitted any country in Europe ; since it had no post, but on horseback ; no high roads but from one part of France. The arts and sciences were neglected ; very little trade was going on ; no agriculture but of the most ordi nary kind was encouraged ; few manufactories ; and the whole country had nothing to recom mend it, but its fine sky and its fruitful but scandalously-neglected soil. In Spain, there are no public inns but such as are fit for Spaniards to enter ; and no provisions are to be procured in any of them, except those on the road from Perpignan to Barcelona, and on the roads towards Madrid, and the Estremadu ras. When a traveller arrives at one of these inns, and asks the landlord what he has to give his visitors for dinner, the fellow will answer, laconically, \" nada ;\" that is to say, nothing. If, therefore, you happen to be on a road, at a distance from any town or village, and have not had the precaution to take a supply with you,"], [340, "300 VENICE. you must go without. To be sure, if the inn happen to be situated in a village or town, the landlord \u2014 standing at the door of his pig-stie, with a segar in his mouth, and his knowledge box covered with an immensely large slouched, broad-brimmed hat, and a dirty long cloak, even in the month of July or August \u2014 will some times condescend to point out to you the dif ferent shops or stalls, at which are sold beef, mutton, bread, butter, and the other things ne cessary for your dinner ; but, not a peg will he stir, either to procure them for you, or to dress them after you shall have purchased them. And then, again, at night ! if you are fortu nate enough to obtain a little clean straw to sleep upon, to prevent your being covered with vermin, you will have procured a treasure, which few, very few, enjoy. But, notwithstanding all this, the unconscionable landlord will, in the morning, send you in a bill, which is often as exorbitant as that of an English hotel-keeper, on the Bath road, at the height of the season."], [341, "301 V E N I C F..

Some idea of the naturally quiet and peaceable disposition of the Venetians, may be formed from the reply which General Miolis, when governor of Venice, made to Buonaparte, on being reprimanded for so frequently absenting himself from the city, and going to Mestre and Treviso \u2014 \" General,\" said Miolis, \" the Ve netians are just as well governed in my absence, as they would be in my presence : they are by nature quiet, and want no force to controul them ; for there is at Venice a considerable population, but no mob.\""], [342, "302 VENICE. Napoleon, after his coronation, thought for the first time, of visiting his Italian slaves, and determined to include Venice in the general tour. Orders were accordingly sent round to all the civil magistrates, to meet him within the limits of their several governments. The prefects, as the heads of the different departments, with the sub-prefects, and their ladies, were all directed to appear en grand train. Milan was no longer the fashion, and Venice was become \" ma bonne ville.\" Vicenza was to be the rendezvous of the pre fects and sub-prefects. The famous Olympic Theatre, built by the immortal Palladio, and to light up which requires no less than a but of oil, attracted the notice of the \" altissimo impe ratore.\" Observing which, the magistrate took the liberty of informing the mighty man, that from its dilapidated and neglected state, they were fearful they should shortly be deprived of this grand national monument. No sooner did he hear this, than, turning round and calling to his adopted son \u2014 for no mortal was allowed to approach the person of the \" altissimo \" un called for \u2014 he said, \" I authorize you, Eugene, to present the commissioners of the Olympic with a hundred thousand livres.\" And, that the admiring spectators might be struck with his"], [343, "303 VENICE. munificence, this direction was given in an audible tone of voice. The prince bowed as sent ; but the money for the repairs was never forthcoming ; and this beautiful specimen of ar chitectural skill continues in the same dilapi dated condition to this day. As Buonaparte had always a list of the pre fects and sub-prefects of the departments he was about to visit, he singled out such to con verse with as were of noble birth. Seeing amongst them the name of the Marquis Anto nio Solari \u2014 who was then governor of the Sibe rians of Italy, in the mountains called the Sette Communi, and in a small village of which, called La Mara, some of the inhabitants had oppo sed themselves to the unusual taxation, and had shot several excise officers who had come to enforce the payment of the same \u2014 Buona parte said to him, \" Marquis Solari, when you return to Asiago \u2014 \" (the name of the capital of the Sette Communi) \u2014 \" tell the people they must submit to be placed on the same footing with the rest of my subjects, and that if they again rebel, I will certainly exterminate them.\" The Marquis replied \u2014 \" I hope your Majesty will not confound a populace of nearly forty thousand peaceable souls, with a few misguided individuals.\""], [344, "304 VENICE. \" But I will be obeyed,\" continued Buo naparte ; \" my laws shall be executed, and my officers shall remain unmolested. Tell them, Sir, that I have long arms, and can at any time reach them.\" The Marquis Solari replied, .. \" I hope your Majesty will dispense with my so doing, since all Europe, I believe, is well convinced of the length of those arms.\" Buonaparte being rather pleased with this reply, began to take snuff by wholesale ; and then, addressing the Marquis, he said, \" I think I have seen you before ?\" \u2014 \"Yes, please your Majesty,\" answered Solari, \" at Milan, in consequence of an application to your Majesty, for the restoration of two carriages of which I had been robbed, and also at the marriage of the Princess Borghese with General Le Clerc, at my friend's the Duke di Serbelloni's, where your Majesty was pleased to invite me to the public breakfast.\" \u25a0 \" O, yes, yes,\" replied Buonaparte, \" I remember.\" On leaving the Marquis to speak to another person, he said laughingly, \" So, Marquis Solari, you think the people of the Sette Communi know the length of my arm ?\" This conversation took place at Vicenza ; from which place Buonaparte set off for Ve-"], [345, "305 VENICE. nice. But the good people of that city, having, for centuries, been in the habit of seeing most of the sovereigns of Europe, were by no means struck with astonishment at his much vaunted abilities ; and he lost, at that place, much of his celebrity, on their becoming personally acquainted with him : for he confined his con versation to simple interrogatories ; therein imitating those princes who, being deficient in logical powers, aim at being understood by a vacant smile, a shake of the head, or a shrug of the shoulders ; and who find it easier to listen to what is said to them, than give thereto an appropriate off-hand reply. When Buonaparte visited the Casinos of the noble ladies, his conversation was extremely limited. \" What's your name ? Whereabouts do you live ? When do you go to the Terra Firma ? Have you ever been to Paris ? Are you married ? How many children have you ? Who is your husband ?\" One lady told him, she had been married several years, but had had no children. \" Then kick your husband out of bed,\" was his reply. However, he fixed his attention on one of the most aukward and mal adroit ladies of the whole company, who had no earthly quality to recommend her, excepting her youth ; invited her to dine with him on the fol- VOL. i X"], [346, "306 VENICE. lowing day ; and appointed her one of the ladies of honour to the Empress ; as he did also the ladies Catherine Micchielli Pisani, Lucy Mo cenigo, Elizabeth Damula, Marietta Quirini, &c. ; but, as there was at that time no Empress in Italy, these poor females were under the necessity of trotting all the way to Milan, to perform their noble office, near the person ofthe Vice-queen, the wife of Prince Eugene, with an appointment of four hundred livres a year. These ladies of honour, however, used to afford the vice-queen no small amusement, when at Monza ; where the Prince Eugene, her husband, was wont to employ his leisure hours in making them good christians, by ducking them from head to heels \u2014 to the no small diver sion of her suite, and the mortification of the aforesaid dames d'hon?ieur. However, it was one way of being soused into favour ; for one and all of them were fortunate enough to pro cure good situations for their husbands ; nor could it be attributed to any improper secret influence, since all the ladies, excepting one, bore unimpeachable characters. The Princess of Bavaria, the vice-queen, was certainly a very virtuous and amiable woman ; but, so totally a slave was she to the tyrannical etiquette of Buonaparte's court, that she dared not to interfere in behalf of any individual; nor"], [347, "307 VENICE. was it ever known that she acted illiberally. When commanded by Buonaparte, she would make a present to her ladies of a French silk gown, a shawl, a necklace, or a pair of ear rings, as a compensation for those which the prince her husband had seized, to keep them in good-humour. When the Empress Josephine was at Milan, the vice-queen scarcely ever showed herself; as she could not brook the ideaof giving up her rank by birth, toa newly created Empress of yesterday. A similar feeling she also discovered at the time of Napoleon's coronation. When the Queens of Spain, Naples, and Holland, were the train bearers to Josephine, she refused to go in the procession, and absented herself, under pretence of sudden illness ; and, from motives of pru dence, she kept her room, while most of the grand fetes were going on, upon that occasion. On the birth of Prince Eugene's first daugh ter, Napoleon created her Princess of Bologna, and the city of that name was graciously charged with the cost of her establishment and education. This, however, was a mere trifle, considering the high honour that was conferred on them ! And, truly, what were a few millions to an inland town like Bologna ! Buonaparte was certainly one of the best cal- A ~A"], [348, "308 VENICE. culators in the universe ; for he never speculated without a reason. His honours were always let out to interest. He would often talk of his long arms ; but, if he had added thereto his long sight, in accomplishing every object \u2014 up to a certain point \u2014 that presented itself to his view, he certainly would not have overrated the degree to which he possessed this extraordinary faculty. As I have more than once mentioned the share which the well-known Barras had in the overthrow of the Venetian republic, I think I cannot do better than introduce into this chapter, an anec dote or two respecting this extraordinary man. During my visit to Brussels, in the year 1803, Barras was living in that city in very good style. Hearing of my arrival, he paid us a visit at the Hotel de Bellevue, and gave us a general invi tation to his table, during our stay. It was during one of these visits, that the sale to Moreau of Grosbois, which had been the pro perty of the present King of France, and had been presented to Barras by the National As sembly, while he was one of the Directory, took place. He would frequently say to us, when speak ing of Buonaparte, \" vous verrez, mes amis, qu'il ne mourira pas tranquille a Paris.\""], [349, "309 VENICE. He had a female with him, whom he intro duced to us as one of his aid-de-camps, and who was constantly en habit d'homme. At Brussels, he was always called General Barras, and was not allowed to be visited by, or to receive visits from, the inhabitants. Penticulon, the then prefect of that city, kept a watchful eye on the exile. At the time of my stay there, another noble Venetian beside my husband, was lodging at our hotel, to whom Barras made himself known ; as he did, indeed, to all tra vellers. This nobleman we one day met at Barras's house, when the following curious conversation relative to the Venetian Ambassa dor, Alvise Quirini Stampatello, and the vio lation of that republic, (for the protection of which Barras had received a very considerable douceur,) took place. By the bye, the Abbe Fortis, who was at Paris, while Quirini was treating for the neutrality of Venice, used to say, that he had not been sufficiently liberal to Barras's subalterns ; who, in consequence, marred the intention of their master. Be that as it may, Barras con fessed to us, that the Five Directors were only tlie executioners of the peremptory will of the great Buonaparte, and that Alvise Quirini, in x 3"], [350, "310 VENICE. his mode of negociating the transaction, had discovered himself to be a mere blockhead. \" I believe,\" said the Venetian nobleman, in reply to this observation, \" it would have been a very difficult task to have found an honest man capable of treating, on equal terms, with the corrupt government which then existed in France.\" \" There,\" replied Barras, \" is the grand error into which so many people have fallen. Nothing was further from the intention of the civil go vernment in France, than to make territorial conquests, or to stir up the governments of other countries against our own. It was all owing to the army, and to the ungovernable ambition of that Jean-F Buonaparte; and which ambi tion will never cease but with his life, and ultimately be his overthrow. \" After Buonaparte had made himself master of Italy (which, I confess, to my bitter regret, was my own fault), the civil government of France had no influence whatever, but was wholly dependant on the military ; who, from a sentiment of blind enthusiasm, were subservient to Buonaparte. \" I was the most strenuous advocate for a general peace ; and, above all, for a peace with England. Had she acceded to that peace, and"], [351, "311 VENICE. had not the Directory been betrayed, Buonaparte would never have been able, in an underhand way, to have made himself Dictator, to the destruc tion of the best interests of France : for all his conquests have only served to rob her of men and of money. He squandered thetreasures of France and of Italy upon two hundred thousand men, who thus had the means of corrupting millions. This, I assure you, is the real state ofthe case. \" There were three things which Buona parte was suffered to commit with impunity, any one of which would have cost the life of any other man. His conduct towards Kleber in Egypt; his cruelty towards his prisoners ; and his coming from Egypt to Paris without performing qua rantine, and there upsetting the government ; were all offences, for which he was on the point of being declared hors de la hi. He, however. triumphed over all of them, and has completed his ingratitude by banishing me, his first friend and liberal benefactor ! \" The way, too, in which all his operations have hitherto been seconded by his good fortune, is altogether astonishing. How long it will last it is impossible for me to say ; but I think I may venture to assert, that the impetuosity of his cha racter will shortly carry him out of his depth. Had he governed the French with the precau- x 4"], [352, "312 VENICE. tionary mildness of the Directory, he would long ago have been buried in the dust. Happy would it have been for Europe, if he had never arrived at his present giddy elevation ! But he rules his subjects with a rod of iron ; and France, intoxicated with her gigantic conquests\u2014con quests which she can only retain as long as the fanaticism which has blinded her to her real in terest shall continue \u2014 must, sooner or later, submit to another revolution, before Europe can be restored to its just equilibrium.\" All this was uttered by Barras with an energy that gave to his words the conviction of truth. He was remarkably animated while he was speaking ; and, so anxious were we to hear him justify himself on many points that had been laid to his charge, that we never interrupted him, except when he happened to appeal to us for our opinion. I shall here relate another curious circum stance, which took place at a dinner at the Hague, where, by accident, we met with Marshal Augereau, the Duke de Castiglione. In the beginning of the French revolution, Augereau was a common soldier in one of the Neapolitan regiments; from which, through the interest of the French ambassador, Perregou, he had been discharged, and had been taken, by"], [353, "VENICE. 313 that gentleman, into his house, in the capacity of fencing-master to his children. Wishing to figure away in the revolution, Augereau pre vailed en the ambassador to give him letters of introduction to the principal cities in his route to France, that he might defray the expenses of his journey by giving lessons to academies. Being acquainted with Busienello, the Venetian ambassador at Naples, he procured a letter from him to my husband at Venice ; who was a great proficient in the said art, and one of the best swordsmen in all Italy. When we were at the Hague, on entering one day the house of a gentleman, with whom we were to dine, he introduced us, by name, to Augereau. His Venetian acquaintance knew thegeneral immediately ; but, not wishing to hurt his feelings, my husband did not remind him of their former acquaintance at Venice. However, being seated opposite each other at table, Au gereau said to him \u2014 \" Good God ! I did not at first recollect you. How happy am I to see you again ! Don't you recollect going round, at the academy, with your silver plate, to col lect the money for me, from the friends whom you were good enough to interest in my behalf at Venice ? Come, come, Sir, don't be ashamed of having done a good action. I have not for-"], [354, "314 VENICE. got it, I assure you ; and, while you are in this country, I hope you and your better half will favour me with your company at my residence.\" Count Zenobio was also one of the party. We could not, however, avail ourselves of his hospitality, as we had a prior engagement ; but we frequently met in the evening at Augereau's. Venice was often the subject of our conversation. When we were one day talking of Buonaparte's unprincipled sale of that republic to Austria, \" Ma foi,\" said Augereau, \" ce coquin nous a tout trompe ! In saving him, the French republic upset itself. Had the Directory but ordered him to be shot on his landing from Egypt, it would have immortalized itself; but it was an unwieldy body, without a head ; and that was the reason why Sieyes would notbecome one of them. I foresee we shall return to what we were ; if we do not, indeed, sink into some thing worse ! Buonaparte has deceived us all ; and, though he has forgotten the hospitality of the Venetian Republic towards the French, / shall ever feel grateful for the civilities I once received from one of its subjects. Your sorrow at beholding the degraded state of your once happy country does infinite honour, both to your head and your heart.\" I record this anecdote, for the purpose of"], [355, "VENICE. 315 doing justice to the memory of Augereau : as it evinces feelings, which are but too seldom to be met with in those who have risen above their primitive condition in life.

I concluded the last chapter, with an ac count of my interviews, with Barras and with Augereau. I shall commence the present, with an anecdote which was related to me by ano ther of Buonaparte's generals."], [356, "316 VENICE. In the course of my conversations with Gene ral Menou, whilst he was governor of Venice, he more than once assured me, that of all Buonaparte's lunatic projects, the notion of invading England, and the idea of seducing Russia, while he was in Egypt, to co-operate with him in the conquest of India, were by far the most preposterous, and the least likely to be accomplished. Menou said, that Buonaparte had been more indebted to the folly of Nelson, in suffering him to get to Egypt, and to the British cruizers in allowing him to land, on his return therefrom, than to any thing that the French nation had done for him ; for that if, in both instances, the English fleet had done their duty, he never would have escaped. \" Your Rodney, and your Howe, and your Hood, would not,\" he would say, \" have been so complaisant to the French general.\" Indeed, that Buonaparte was never serious in his* much boasted project of invading this coun try, may be gathered from the following facts, which took place during my stay at Paris, where I arrived shortly after Lord Nelson had attempted the bombardment of the port of Bou logne. A task, by the bye, of no very easy accomplishment ; first, on account of the town itself being beyond the reach of the ships of"], [357, "317 VENICE. war; and, secondly, because no vessel drawing more than three or four feet water, can ever approach near enough for that purpose. However, the Hero of the Nile did every thing that skill and bravery could accomplish ; and the effects of his operations were pretty apparent, from the fact of the few gun-boats in that port, which had been pr<~ mred for the invasion of Old England, havi; ; been taken out of the water, and drawn ipon dry land, and placed in a state of security, for fear of a second Nelsonian attack. At Paris, the success of the invasion of England was looked upon as a dead cer tainty. In their mind's eye, the badauds of \" ma bonne ville \" already fancied they beheld the Corsican making his triumphant entry into their capital, loaded with the treasures of the Bank of England, and followed by the machinery and the manufactures aud the other spoils, of this the modern Carthage \u2014 about to be destroyed ! Amongst the number of the duped, was the Venetian patrician Niccoletto Cornara, who ventured to lay a considerable bet, that, on a certain day, Buonaparte would set off on his march from Dover for London. From the experience I had had of the French General's"], [358, "318 VENICE. menacing character, and knowing that, though he had accomplished many great things, he had left still greater ones unaccomplished, I ven tured to take the bet ; and, the better to convince myself of the real state of things, I determined on setting off from Paris on a visit to the coast, where these weighty preparations were said to be in such a state of forwardness. My love of England, and my knowledge ofthe character of the brave inmates of her wooden walls, ambitious as I knew Buonaparte to be, would not allow me to give credit to the rumour, that he entertained a serious design of making the attempt ; more especially as I well knew that at that very moment, his attentions were directed to the secret movements of the cabinet of Vienna, and that he had just succeeded in getting into his possession a most important despatch, intended for the Austrian Ambas sador, Count Cobenzel ; and which despatch has, I believe, never been made public. But to proceed. Scarceiy had I, with my husband, proceeded a few paces on the road to Boulogne, before we met a considerable num ber of troops, with ammunition waggons, re trograding from the field of action, and marching in a totally different direction. In consequence of his knowledge of the above-"], [359, "319 VENICE. mentioned treachery towards the Austrian am bassador, my husband, at seeing this, exclaimed, \" These troops are going to Vienna !\" We stopped our carriage, for the purpose of letting them pass, and interrogated some of them, as to whence they came, and whither they were going? They replied, that they had come from the ports of Boulogne and Calais ; that all the troops, after Nelson had paid them a visit at the former place, had been disbanded ; and that they believed they were going to semestre. We continued our journey to Boulogne ; and, on our arrival, we immediately went down to the port to see this second edition of the Spanish Armada, upon which Buonaparte had expended twelve millions of livres ; when we sound the whole of it to consist of seventeen gunboats capable of carrying from thirty-five to forty men each, with two small field pieces ! This was the extent of the mighty force which had been put into requisition, and, which had kept John Bull in such a state of agitation ! The whole, too, as I have already observed, were safely drawn up on dry land. We dined at the table d'hote ; and, on our telling the story of our having come all the way from Paris to witness the embarkation,"], [360, "320 VENICE. we were heartily laughed at, for our pains. \" Ah !\" said one, \" you are not the only dupes by hundreds, who have been taking this wild goose journey.\" \" No, no,\" said another, \" the sea is not our element : the Pas de Calais is not Mount Cenis, where we were suffered to pass uninterruptedly ; nor is it the Bochetta at Genoa, where the Austrians, with a couple of pieces of cannon, might have destroyed the whole French Army ; nor is John Bull, or the English nation, like the divided people of Italy !\" We next proceeded to Calais, where we found, that all the preparations that had been made consisted of seven boats of the same con struction as those at Boulogne ; and not a single soldier more than was absolutely necessary to garrison the town. One thing cannot be denied ; namely, that the English, notwithstanding their immense naval force, had little or no real and genuine intelligence, as to the movements of their neighbours. Had this not been the case, the threatened invasion never could have produced a thousandth part of the sensation on the minds of the good people of England which it is known to have done. For it is a fact but too well established, that, excepting the intelligence"], [361, "VENICE. 321 which they procured from infamous hired spies, the British Government gave no credence to that which was afforded them by respectable private individuals, who were actuated solely by a love of their native country. To my own certain knowledge, many valuable hints were given to the British government, on the subject of the wood-cutting commission at Fiume, where the English had an exclusive contract. Notwithstanding which, her enemies were, all the time, felling, thick and thin, the forest in the Tyrole \u2014 Aye ! and in the teeth of the very commissioner Adamici, and the British consul at Fiume. In an early chapter of my work, I have cal led Buonaparte the \" Arch-drover of Italy ;\" and, that he is richly entitled to the appellation, tlie following facts will shew. Not that I wish to have it inferred, that he has not, per fas aut nefas, rendered numerous benefits to the French nation, and to the cause of liberty and of civi lization. It cannot, however, be denied, that he grossly deceived and betrayed the unfortu nate people of Italy. Previously to his coming to Venice, Buona parte stopped at Malghera. Here it was, that he decreed the dissolution of the aristocracy, or, more properly speaking, of the oligarchical re- VOL. I. y"], [362, "322 VENICE. public ; commanded the imprisonment of the three inquisitoridi stato, and installed, as he made the credulous people believe, pro tempore, the democratical government ; for he well knew, that an absolute monarchy and a plebeian de mocracy are equally vicious. That neither Napoleon, nor any one of his family, were democrats at heart, I think I have already shewn, and shall hereafter still further substantiate, out of their own mouths, and from documents which cannot be disproved, in my account of the exploits of the Buonaparte Fa mily in the Milanese territories. Antecedently to this revolution in the Venetian republic, a secret article \u2014 and a most atrocious one it was \u2014 had been entered into, at the peace of Campo Formio, between France and Austria, for the sale of the Venetians. Where, then, was the necessity for the democratizing of this govern ment ? And, when he had effected his purpose, why be ashamed of a democratrical representa tive ; which he refused to send to that congress, still further to make the credulous Venetians believe, that they might stipulate for their inde pendence when he had already sold them, by ordering one of the most distinguished of the Venetian nobility to be sent thither, as in former times, under the old decripit oligarchical authority which he so vehemently,reprobated ?"], [363, "323 VENICE. His express words, when Orazio Lavezzari wait ed on him in the Terra Ferma (for he never came to Venice until years after), and asked him, \" who are we to send to treat at Campo Formio, \u2014 one of the new order ?\" were \" Bah, no, no, no ! non voglio nessuno di quella canaglia ; send a noble patrizio, and do you accompany him. You have been resident in England, have you not ?\" \" Yes,\" said La vezzari. Previously to the institution of the municipal officers, Buonaparte ordered the list of names to be sent to him ; but many individuals of res pectability, who were supposed by him to be of the French party, merely in consequence of their having spoken freely as to the necessity of the republic changing its political system according to circumstances, and who had no wish for French interference, and much less for the total overthrow of the republican au thority, when they were called upon and asked whether they would become members of the municipality \u2014 one of them in particular declin ed, and, striking out his name, left Venice and retired to his country seat, for fear of being compelled to accept the office. This took place in the year 1796. In 1808, when Buonaparte was made King of Italy, this y 2"], [364, "324 VENICE. gentleman, the Marquis Antonio Govion Solari, was made vice-prefect. The first time Buona parte ever saw him, instantly recollecting the name, he said, \" Ah, Marquis ! I remember ; you declined being a member of the munici pality !\" Solari had nearly forgotten the circum stance, when Buonaparte repeated, \" Yes, yes ! you scratched out your name, though Cornaro, Dolfin, Pisani, and many other of your friends and acquaintances were among the number. Well, well, they are all dead, and you are alive. I suppose you had your reasons for refusing ; and I have mine for now appointing you to serve the office of prefect.\" It is a curious fact, that, in these matters, the memory of Buo naparte scarcely ever failed him. This gentleman, the Marquis di Solari, was appointed to the government in the mountains, called the Sette Communi, exclusively inhabited by the descendants of the Cimbri, who, being beaten and dispersed near Verona, by Marius, a hundred and one years before the Christian \u00e6ra, betook themselves to those mountains ; and, up to this very day, have preserved their ancient customs, as well as their ancient language, which a good deal resembles the Danish and the Low Dutch. The women and children, who have never quitted their Alpine situation, nei-"], [365, "325 VENICE. ther speak nor understand the Italian ; though the spot in which they live is only at the dis tance of about thirty miles from Vicenza. The men, who, during the winter months, are obliged to descend into the vallies, for the purpose of procuring food for their cattle, (every thing on the earth being frozen up for eight months out of the twelve,) speak the Venetian dialect. Together, they form a population of from six-and-thirty to forty thousand souls. For the most part, they are shepherds. The country they inhabit produces scarcely any thing in the mountainous parts, excepting a a little barley, and fire-wood. The small por tion of the country which is flat is planted with tobacco, which, since the revolution, they are obliged to sell to the government ; whereas, before that period, the Venetian republic bene volently exempted these poor mountaineers from all kinds of public taxes, and, on account of the sterility of their soil, granted them, into the bargain, several very important privi leges ; deeming them sufficiently taxed al ready by nature, in the deprivation of the common necessaries of life ; such as bread and every kind of vegetables ; which articles they are obliged to fetch, either from Bassano, at a distance of five-and-twenty miles, or from y 3"], [366, "326 VENICE. Vicenza ; as they are more than two thousand feet above the level of the sea. Indeed, the spot is considered the very Sibe ria of Italy. The snow begins to fall in Sep tember ; and often continues on the ground until the month of May, and sometimes as late as June. To enable them to go to church or walk about, the shoes of the people are pre pared, in the same manner as those of the horses are, which have to travel over ice. In their manners and customs, they somewhat resemble the feudal slaves in Poland and Russia. In their houses, as well as in their persons, they are remarkably slovenly and dirty. There is only one house built of brick in the whole district ; and that house is situated in Asiago, the capital of the Sette Com muni. The rest are composed of mud and stones, and are thatched with rushes or straw. The cold is sometimes so intense, that the oil is laid in large lumps before the fire to dissolve, before it can be used. The wines and spirits are sure to be genuine ; for the watery particles freeze, and the pure spirit only remains. The in habitants are obliged to cook all their provisions with snow water. A small spring runs through the town of Asiago, but the people bathe, water their cattle, and empty their cloacas into it ;"], [367, "327 VENICE. which makes it useless for any particular pur pose ; so that the very salutary operation of washing can only be performed during the three or four summer months. The reason why the inhabitants are allowed the privilege of planting tobacco, which is in general prohibited by the Austrian and French authorities, is because it is so particu larly beneficial to the population ; as the little ploughable land which they possess, is, in a twelve-fold degree, more productive in this article, then it would be in any other grain, root, or seed ; and supplies them with the means of procuring money, wherewith to pur chase the first necessaries of life. They are, however, as I have just said, obliged to dispose of the whole of the said tobacco to the government. In fact, these people, when living under the Venetian government, formed a sort of inde pendent little republic ; and scraped together a livelihood, as much by smuggling, as by their Alpine industry. When the French became masters of Italy, these poor creatures were put on the same footing with the Corsican's other Italian subjects, and subjected to the general system of taxation ; as well as to that most terrible of all scourges, the conscription ! As I have before observed, the Marquis di y 4"], [368, "328 VEN I C E. Solari had the misfortune to be sent amongst these people, for the purpose of organizing the said system. As may naturally be imagined, some of the poor creatures resisted the new order of things, and at a small village, called La Mara, revolted, and refused to allow the con scription to take place. Being excellent marks men, theyfired on the authorities, and compelled them, for a time, to abandon the idea of recruit ing among them. Their own clergy and other of the inhabitants were selected by the French, to point out the youths who were qualified to be drawn. But being, like the Jews, all re lated to one another, by marriages and inter marriages, not a man of them would they give up ; and the authorities were obliged to desist, until they had procured from Vicenza a military force strong enough to protect the civil powers from being shot at. Besides, as these moun tains are within gun-shot of the Bavarian terri tories, to which the poor creatures fled when ever they were in dread of being punished, it was found prudent, even when the military had been called in to aid the civil authorities, to proceed with the greatest caution. In the mean time, the prefect Solari, who was a very humane and excellent man, went amongst them at the risk of his life, amidst a"], [369, "329 VENICE. volley of shot, and, expostulating with them on the consequence of their futile resistance, persuaded them to return to their duty ; kindly promising to use his best exertions with the head of the authorities at Milan, to get them exempted from the payment of several heavy taxes. When Buonaparte was crowned King of Italy, the Prefect Solari was obliged to repair to Milan, with the rest of the magistrates of the Bacchillione ; and, though the above affair had taken place in 1796 or 1797> when the new monarch was only a general in the army, yet, when he again saw the Prefect of Asiago, in the year 1808, he immediately recollected the above circumstance, and talked over the whole matter with the Marquis. Speaking relatively, the inhabitants of Asiago, considering their situation, are in a state of ease ; and some few of them are rich both in lands and in cattle. They, however, live nearly in a state of nature. They are unac quainted with the use of table linen, and very few of the men wear collars to their shirts. Some of them, who had been educated at the University of Padua, and at other public se minaries, on their return to Asiago, endea voured to introduce amongst them the grada-"], [370, "330 VENICE. tion between master and servant, so indis pensable in civilized society ; but they were obliged to relinquish the project, as none of them would stay with masters, who would not permit them to take their meals at the same time, and at the same table, as themselves. There never was an instance of an ox being killed in the whole Sette Communi. The only animal food consumed by them is that of sheep, very young calves, and goats. Their trade is in the above cattle, and in a few cows. They make very little butter, but save all the milk for the purpose of being made into cheese. Providence has bestowed on the people of the Sette Communi strong minds, and a large portion of natural genius. But, they are artful, cun ning, and revengeful. They have retained the broad-featured countenance of the northern nations, and have high cheek-bones, small eyes, and rather flatfish noses. They are above the middle stature, and have large stout limbs. The women are rather of a masculine cast. They wait at table, and scarcely ever sit down to eat, until their husbands have finished then meals. In the beginning of September, such of the natives as are not mechanics quit the moun tains with their cattle, to find forage till the"], [371, "331 VENICE. month of May; when they again return to them. At one time, they were accustomed to make violent irruptions into the territories of the Venetians, wherever they could find pasture for their cattle ; but now they are under the ne cessity of paying for whatever they consume. During these months, the people ofthe Sette Communi resemble a nation of Amazonians ; for the men and boys are all absent, taking charge of their flocks. The country partakes much of the appearance of the barren Alpine mountains in Switzerland. Every thing in the shape of a carriage is drawn by mules ; as some of the passes will not admit the narrowest two-wheeled conveyance, and are, in the autumn, on ac count of the torrents that overflow the gravelly valleys, and again in spring, when the snow and ice are thawing, altogether impassable. And such, indeed, was the precise situation of the Sette Communi, when the first prefect Solari took possession of his semi-barbarous situation. For nearly twenty days was he de tained, with sixty of these animals, men and beast, at the foot of the mountains near the Brenta, which run down to the Tirol, at a most uncomfortable village inn. And, when at last he arrived at Asiago, the house destined for him \u2014 which, as I have before said, was the"], [372, "332 VENICE. only one in the place built of brick, and which belonged to a M. Bonhomo, residing at Vi cenza \u2014 was so much out of repair, that the first night the worthy Prefect and his family slept in it, they were within an ace of being drowned in their beds, from the torrents of rain which fell into every apartment. And, in this state were they obliged to live, until a house could be built, suitable for the reception of the first magistrate ; but, at his own expense ! In the mean time, the government directed, that the house of M. Bonhomo should be made tenantable and water-proof; but, as these orders were not accompanied with that necessary in gredient V argent, they were of no avail, and the prefect had no alternative, but either to live in the streets, or to defray the expense of the said repairs himself. Again : in consequence of the frost, no mortar could be used ; and therefore was the Marquis Solari obliged to build entirely with wood. So that, what with the expense of the building; what with the expense of the journey ; what with the damage done to his furniture ; and what with the quantity of china, glass, and earthen ware that was smashed into pieces \u2014 and for which, though promised, he was never indemnified \u2014 at the end of his prefectureship,"], [373, "333 VENICE. the worthy Marquis of Solari, had the morti fication of finding himself some thousands of livres minus by his official appointment ! \" Ahi ! misero chi speme in mortal cose pone ! ' The mud habitations, or rather the wretch ed huts or stables in which men, women, and children are all huddled together, are covered, as I before observed, with rushes. To make fast the extremity of these rushes, large planks, pro jecting about two feet into the streets, are attach ed ; which planks not only serve to carry off the water, but act as a shelter from the rain to walk under. The fire-place is in the middle of the apartment ; and, as the houses have no chim neys, the smoke collects, of course, on the walls and ceilings, which are as black as coal pits : consequently, the water that falls from the projecting boards is as black as ink. The clerk of the prefecture being one day sud denly caught in the rain, took shelter under one of these boards ; and, not being aware of the internal construction of the habitation, he re turned home in the utmost amazement ; de claring, that, though he had been a great travel ler, he had never before been in a country, where it rained ink ; for the drops that had fallen had actually died his coat and his inexpressibles, of"], [374, "334 VENICE. a jet, as profound as is the Blacking of Mr. Turner, of Mr. Warren, of Mr. Martin, or of any of those shining characters, the nigrescent qualities of whose respective wares are chaunted in lofty verse, and are so strikingly proclaimed, in chalk, and in words really and truly sesqui- pedalian, on all the walls of all our highways and byways : and, for resorting to which mode of obtaining celebrity, they, individually and collectively, deserve, according to my hum- ble opinion, the attention of our present ex- cellent Secretary of State for the Home De partment, and of their vigilant worships of Bow Street and elsewhere. All I shall say is, that, if there be not at present any regulation of po lice, capable of reaching these Mural Defacers of some ofthe handsomest edifices in and about the first metropolis in the world, it is high time there should be one ! The nuisance ought forthwith to be abated. Of such men I say, \" Hie Niger est ; hunc tu Romane caveto !\" In calling the public attention to this most offensive practice, I have done no more than my duty \u2014 liber avi animam meam ! But, to return to my story. The knight of the quill, observing his coat and his inexpressi bles in this filthy condition, was actually on the"], [375, "335 VENICE. point of setting down to send to the celebrated M. Chaptal at Paris, an account of his new and most wonderful discovery, when he was let into the secret by one of his fellow clerks. He thereupon laughed heartily at his mistake ; and ever after, when ink was wanted in the office, the clerks would humorously say, \" let us go under the projections and get some ; for it is of a deeper black there, than any that we can elsewhere procure.\" It is most unaccountable, that, out of so many thousand travellers, who have been in Italy, none of them, as I recollect, have hitherto had the curiosity to visit this, the Siberia of Italy ; or given to the world a description of its singular inhabitants. At least, I do not remember to have seen them mentioned in any of the numerous books of travels, as they are called, that have recently been published. From their very ancient origin, they appear to me to deserve a particular notice. The description I have given of them will be found strikingly correct : and I think I shall be allowed to have had some opportunities of becoming acquainted with this people, when I state, that I have done what, I will venture to say, no woman in England but myself has done ; namely, lived amongst them during the space of fourteen"], [376, "336 VENICE. long months, without so much as once descend ing the mountains, until, as my countrymen are accustomed to say, I quitted them \" for good.\" During the long winter evenings, it is not at all uncommon, at Asiago, to be favoured with visits from a whole troop of hungry foxes. However, the danger to be apprehended from them is generally avoided, by the timely howl ing of the dogs ; who scent them at a con siderable distance, and thereby afford the in habitants time to shut themselves up in their houses ; whence they fire upon the crafty ani mals, through their oiled-paper windows ; for few indeed of the houses have glass ones. The people of Asiago bear a striking re semblance to the feudal slaves of Russia and Poland. In one of the villages, called Enego, some straw hats are manufactured. While the Marquis di Solari was Prefect, from the liberal commissions which he gave them for his nume rous Venetian friends and acquaintances, and from the endeavours which he made, at his own expense, to instruct the natives in imitating those which are manufactured by the Floren tines, he succeeded in getting three completed, in time to be sent to Milan and placed in the public exhibition, with the other specimens of the manufactures of Italy. One of them was"], [377, "337 VENICE. presented by his lady to the Vice-queen of Italy ; the second was given to the Countess Warum, her female in waiting ; and the third to Count Brema, Secretary of State ; and all which were most graciously accepted. Grieved, however, am I to announce to the world, that this worthy and upright magistrate, the Marquis Antonio Govion Broglio Solari, fell a sacrifice, in consequence of his happening to be the husband of a British-born subject, who had scorned to betray her native country ; who was known to have been, at one time, une attachee of a great personage at the Bourbon court ; and who had humanely interested her self in behalf of the unfortunate sufferers by Napoleon's accursed Milan and Berlin decrees. And, having once more mentioned these decrees, I think I cannot do better than close my account of Venice ; as well as the first volume of my labours, with the following in teresting particulars, relative thereto. The aforesaid lady was sent for to Milan ; when it was proposed to her, that she should accompany some of the agents of the French Government to England ; there to give immense commissions for goods, in all the different manu facturing towns of England, Scotland, and Ire land. A considerable sum was to be advanced ; vol. 1. z"], [378, "338 VENICE. but the bulk of the articles, when finished, were to be left on the hands of the manufacturers ; which, it was calculated, would occasion a general ferment and even disturbance, at one and the same time throughout the united king dom, and lead, by the assistance of certain individuals well bribed for the purpose, to par tial, if not to general commotion and rebellion ; and in consequence of which state of com motion, the Government would be driven to make peace \u2014 \" all for the good,\" as the parties in question said, \" of Old England.\" To which the said lady gave this sensible and dignified reply \u2014 \" That she was too well acquainted with the spirit ofthe British Govern ment to suppose it could be driven by the ine briety of a rude mob, to conclude a peace which should be disgraceful and ruinous to the nation.\" She was thereupon answered \u2014 \" That there were many persons in England, and even in the House of Commons, who were adverse to the war.\" \" It required no ghost,\" she replied, \" to bring me that intelligence ; since I am con vinced of it better than you can tell me, as long as it continued to be a political war ; which never can, and never will be generally popular, in a commercial country like England, the"], [379, "339 VENICE. emporium and the monopolizer of all the com merce of the world. These very partizans of whom you are speaking no longer exist ; all are now united in the common cause of their country.

These fallacious measures of yours have made it a national one ; and by that step you have done more for England, than England ever before did for herself. You have united all parties. There is now but one voice.

The revolution has taken good care of that !

So greatly was I agitated, and so much what had occurred had changed my countenance, that my man servant asked whether I was not ill, and whether he should not step and get me some refreshments ? I told him I was not ill. I, however, was shortly after obliged to stop the carriage, and take a glass of water. Indeed, the bare mention of the names of the illustrious persons last mentioned, and the recollection of their cruel fate, has ever affected me, and con tinues to do so to this very hour. On reaching home, I instantly made my hus band acquainted with the whole transaction ; at which he was much surprised ; as he had not the slightest suspicion that I had been sent for on such a piece of business, but supposed it to relate solely to the arrests that had taken place, about that time, of all the English ; and as a Mr. Parr, an English gentleman, supposed to be the husband of a Venetian lady, had been just arrested, though a constant resident in the"], [383, "343 VENICE. Venetian territories, and principally at Venice, my husband conjectured that the French agents wished to be informed, whether or not they were British subjects ? However, a few days after, coming from a ball which was given at the theatre La Fenice, an officer called at our casino ; and being in formed where we were gone, he waited our return. Scarcely had we reached home, when the said officer knocked at our door. Upon which the servant said, \" O, that's the man* I suppose, who has been asking, three or sour times this evening, for my mistress.\" It was now between three or four o'clock in the morn ing. My husband, seizing his pistols, ran to the window, and asked who was there ? Upon which, the officer cried out, \" You must open the door, for I want to come in.\" My husband was on the point of firing at the fellow, but I prevailed on him to hear what he had to say in defence of his extraordinary conduct. On entering the casino, and seeing my husband, whom he had formerly served in a menial capa city, when he was employed under the republic, the man was so astounded, that for some mi nutes he could not utter a syllable. At length, he stammered out, \" I am ordered to keep a sharp look-out upon that lady.\" z 4"], [384, "344 VENICE. \" Well ! there she is,\" said my husband, taking me by the hand, \" look at her ; but I am now going to bed with her, and if you dare to offer the smallest violence, or attempt to come into the room, I will that moment blow your brains out. Shew me your authority.\" \" I have none,\" said the officer, \" but that which I have just mentioned ;\" for he was only one of the runners of the police. On the next morning I was allowed to go to my country residence at Treviso, accom panied by this man, who followed my footsteps, even to church. For the two first days, I only walked about my garden, and on the third and fourth, upon the high road ; and, on my return, I always gave directions to have him well taken care of previous to my taking my own break fast. On the fifth day, he left me to take my walk by myself; when, without taking any thing with me but what I had on, I set off in a post chaise for Venice, and, scraping together a few hundred dollars, I hired a fishing boat, as I knew that the British squadron was then block ading the ports in the Adriatic ; but, contrary winds detained me in this open boat for more than three days ; when I came up with Admi ral Fremantle's ship, which took me to Malta ; from which place I wrote to my husband, and"], [385, "345 VENICE. then set off for Sicily, where I continued until the peace. Whether this business was planned at Paris, at Milan, or at Venice, I am unable to say ; but it took place while Napoleon was in Russia.

A few more anecdotes illustrative of the con duct of Buonaparte towards the people of Venice, and I have done. As I have already stated, Buonaparte never had the courage to pay a visit to that city, until he had been crowned Emperor of France and King of Italy ; which event took place in 1810. Nevertheless, in the year 1796, shortly after he had upset and"], [387, "347 V E N I C E. revolutionized the Venetian government, he caused a picture to be painted of himself and staff, in which he was represented as reviewing the cavalry in the Piazza di San Marco ; and from which picture a print was actually en graved and publicly sold at Paris! Now, to those who know any thing of Venice, and that St. Mark's Place is paved with large broad flag stones, and was never intended for equestrian prancings, the absurdity of the thing will be sufficiently apparent. This reminds me of another piece of Parisian gasconade, which occurred while I was in Po land. I say \" Parisian,\" for, according to their own account, all Frenchmen are Parisians. On my return to Italy from Sweden and Rus sia, dining one day with the Princess Lubor miski, at Warsaw, during my visit to that amia ble and accomplished lady, one of the party was a Parisian traveller, whose tongue went at a quicker pace than his body. Being asked, in the course of conversation, how he liked the city of Venice, the impudent braggart replied, with the utmost sang froid, that, \" he could not tell us much about Venice, as he had only stopped there to change horses ! ! \" This anecdote I introduce by way of a cau tion to such of my readers as may be too much"], [388, "348 VENICE. in the habit of swallowing with greedy appetite every thing that is told them by the mercenary advocates of the revolutionary system, respect ing the wonderful exploits of Buonaparte, which have been so loudly trumpeted forth by indi viduals, who have doubtless had weighty reasons for so doing; and several of them, aware ofthe gullibility of my countrymen, and who have taken for their motto the answer of Vespasian to his son Titus, when the latter reproached him with having laid a tax upon a certain article \u2014 \" Lucri bonus odor, ex re qualibet \u2014 ' are said to have reaped a tolerable harvest from their base and filthy employ. Thanks, however, to the native good sense of my countrymen, I am happy to see that they are rapidly returning to their sober senses, and that the writings of the whole train of Imperial White-washers are sinking into that contempt, which the utter worthlessness ofthe trash they have been imposing upon the public, so loudly called for. That Buonaparte did more mischief in the course of his reign than can be redeemed for centuries, and that he is more to be condemned for the good which he left undone, than for the evil which he accomplished, are facts which"], [389, "VENICE. 349 cannot be denied. It must, nevertheless, be granted by all, that an individual who had risen from nothing, to such an unexampled pitch of domination, must have been in possession of most extraordinary talents. Indeed, not to accord to him an amazing tact, in discriminating the objects that could be rendered most con ducive to his several views of aggrandizement, would be the height of folly and of ignorance. I like not to disturb the dead. I must, how ever, be here permitted to make a short dis gression. Since the masterly castigation which \" Le Docteur \" O'Meara's white-washing per formance recently met with from a most able quarterly critic, it is with considerable reluctance that I am induced to \" draw its frail ties from their dread abode ;\" but \" Monsieur Le Docteur \" appears to me \u2014 to speak in the mildest terms \u2014 to have been, in one instance, so completely imposed upon by the Imperial hoaxer, while at St. Helena, that I cannot withstand the temptation of referring to it In page 163 of the first volume, of his \" Voice from St. Helena,\" Buonaparte is made to say to the Doctor, \" louche is a miscreant of all colours, a priest, a terrorist, and one who took an active part in many bloody scenes in the revolution. He is a man who can worm"], [390, "350 VENICE. all your secrets out of you, with an air of calm ness and unconcern. He is very rich, but his riches were badly acquired. There was a tax upon gambling-houses in Paris ; but, as it was an infamous way of gaining money, I did not like to profit by it, and therefore ordered, that the amount of the tax should be appropriated to an hospital for the poor. It amounted to some millions ; but Fouche, who had the col lecting of the impost, put many of them into his own pockets, and it was impossible for me to discover the real yearly sum total.\" Now, that Fouche was the infamous character which the moral imperial hoaxer here represents him to have been, little doubt can, I believe, be entertained, since he was the active instrument of most of Buonaparte's own atrocious misdeeds: so much so, that the latter did not dare to remove him from the office which he held, for fear of his disclosing some of the many enormities which he had directed him to put into execu tion : however, at last, to get rid of this worse than bourreau, Buonaparte sent him ambassador to Rome, with the title of Duke d'Otranto. Now, if Fouche was the \" miscreant of all colours \" which Buonaparte represents him to have been, what a superlative \" miscreant \" must the man have been, who could have promoted such a"], [391, "351 VENICE. monster of infamy to the post of ambassador, and advanced him to a dukedom ! As to Fouche's having appropriated the mo ney arising from the plunder of the gaming houses, \" to an hospital for the poor,\" it is false\u2014 falcissimo \u2014 as the greater part of Jose phine's revenue, which Buonaparte allows to have been very large, was drawn from that source of infamy, and Fouche was charged with the task of exacting from the gaming houses, for that purpose, a certain weekly sum, which was regularly transmitted by him, every Mon day morning, into the hands of the aforesaid \" most virtuous queen.\" So much for Buona parte's not liking to profit by such an \" infamous mode of getting money ! \" In charity to \" Le Docteur,\" I am obliged to consider him as the greatest hoaxee \u2014 (may I coin the word?)\u2014 in Christendom ! The truth is, that no work was ever less cal culated, than the \" Voice from St. Helena,\" to give the world correct impressions, with re gard to the real character of the whole Buona parte race, from brother Jerome up to the parent stock, \" la Madre Letizia,\" whose piety, the Doctor tells the good people of England, is so amazingly great, that the old lady's thoughts are \" entirely divided between God and her son!\""], [392, "352 VENICE. And how, indeed, should the Doctor's book be otherwise ? Were not nearly all his facts taken down from the mouth of the murderer of the Duke d'Enghien himself? Would it not, therefore, be just as great a piece of folly to be lieve them, as it would have been in the jury who recently tried the assassin Thurtell, to have acquitted him, on the solemn asseveration of \u2014 \" I am innocent; so help me, God ?\" That theNapoleon fever is greatly abated, and that the pulse of the people has returned to its true beat, the Doctor must, by this time, be pretty well convinced. He has done wisely in not attempting a reply to the strictures to which I have alluded ; for facts are stubborn things, which cannot be got over by empty assertions. Since their appearance, the \" Voice from St. He lena\" has become \u2014 \"vox, et pr\u00e6terea nihil.\" I assert fearlessly, that my readers will find, in my next volume, under the head of \" The Buo naparte Family in the Milanese territory,\" a more faithful history of the rise, progress, de cline, and fall of that family, than they will do in all the writings of all Napoleon's numerous thick and thin panegyrists and defenders. I am not setting myself as the apologist of Sir Hudson Lowe. His best praise is to be sound in the abuse that has been heaped on him"], [393, "V E N 1 C E. 353 by the agents of the fugitive from PJba : but this I will say, that all the winnings and whim perings about \"barbarous treatment,\" come with a shocking grace from the man, who had treated some of our countrymen and country women with the utmost cruelty. Of his brutal conduct towards Mrs. Watson I have already given a detail. To which I may add, that on Lord Stewart, the present Marquis of Londonderry, coming with the Emperor, of Austria, to Venice, after the happy downfall of her cruel oppressor, and beholding her emaciated and debilitated condition, he gene rously interested himself with the British Go vernment in her behalf, and procuied for her a pension of \u00a350 a year for life, as the widow of a man who, for three and forty years, had served his country, in different capacities, with fidelity. Let me also beg leave to tell Doctor Barry O'Meara, late surgeon, that Buonaparte ordered the arrest of Mrs. Spencer Smith, and the arrest of the Marchioness Catherine Hyde So lari, merely because they were English-born subjects, treating them both like state prisoners, and manfully setting a guard, with loaded mus kets and drawn swoi'ds at the doors of their very bed rooms! Now, to put the thing more home, I vol. i. 2 a"], [394, "354 VENICE. ask Doctor O'Meara, who is no longer a Benedict, how he would like that a man should stand at the bed-room door of his lady, with a drawn sword in his hand ? The Doctor can, I am sure, answer my query, more readily than he can refute the strictures of the Quarterly Re viewers ; and therefore I beg him to do it. The only crime of these ladies was, that they were the subjects of a nation, whose govern ment had baffled all his ambitious views. For Buonaparte not only abhorred the English, but England itself, and has often exclaimed in the presence of the last-mentioned lady, \" bisogna scacciare questa nazione infama dalla carta geo grafrica !\" He detested us in his heart ; what ever he might have endeavoured to make the English incredules at St. Helena believe. He was too artful to condemn, in their presence, the nation that had spared him the igno minous fate of his brother-in-law Murat ; and therefore it was, that he expended his rancour on those who had the immediate care of his person. As to his saying, that the English were a deceitful nation, I am absolutely as tounded, that he should have found any one ready to listen to \u2014 to swallow - to put upon paper - and finally to give to the world, such a ridiculous fallacy. As I have alluded to Buonaparte's escape"], [395, "355 VENICE. from Elba, the recollection of which escape rendered vigilance on the part of the Governor of St. Helena a thousand-fold more imperative, I shall here introduce a short anecdote or two. When Buonaparte abdicated, in 1814, I happened to be at Zante, one of the Ionian Islands. On my return to Venice, I was cre dibly informed, by a person w!o was strongly attached to him, that, previously to his quitting Paris for Elba, he had said, in confidence, to Marshal Ney, \" Italy will always be a resource for me.\" And indeed, if he could have made up his mind to limit his ambition to the govern ment of that country, and to give to it a bond fide representative constitution, he would i ot have been suffered to remain a prisoner at Elba for eight and forty hours ; all Italy would have risen up as one man, and flocked to his standard, from their natural abhorrence to the Germans. But, the truth is, that he had made up his mind, from the first, to return ; and had never seriously abandoned the idea of again becoming the sovereign of France. The correspondence, and the visits back wards and forwards, from France to Elba, were innumerable. Buonaparte's apparent in difference and resignation to his fate, lulled the suspicions of the sovereigns who had banished 2 a 2"], [396, "356 VENICE. him to that pleasant island, where he could almost behold both France and Italy. To keep them still further in the dark, with regard to his future intentions, Buonaparte set about building, and expended considerable sums at Elba ; as if he had really determined on taking up his abode in the island for the remainder of his days. A gentleman, on his return from one of these trips to Elba, on being catechized as to the fact of Buonaparte's activity in his new residence, and as to his preparations for new buildings, answered, \" O ! he'll never live to finish all the plans which he is determined to execute. Few people, you know, who build palaces ever live to enjoy them. His family, however, may.\" This very person, however, must, at the time, have been in the secret of his intended escape from Pvlba ; as it took place only a day or two after he had left the island. On the evening that the news of this escape reached Venice, I happened to be at the con versazione of the once celebrated Madame Marina Benzona, now married to Rangoni When Marshal Chatlaire entered, he announced to us what had happened. This gentleman, who belonged to the Low Countries, was then in the service of Austria, as he had been for years ;"], [397, "V E N I C E. 357 he was therefore one of the class for whom Buonaparte, during the last war in Italy, had caused a general amnesty to be offered, provided they would quit the Austrian service and return home, or accept of rank in the French army. In this amnesty, however, Marshal Chatlaire was not included. On the contrary, Buonaparte had offered 10,000 franks to any one who should bring him, dead or alive, to the head-quarters. \" Now,\" said the Marshal to us, after relating the fact of Buonaparte's escape from Elba, \" I really begin to fancy that my head is in dan ger ;\" adding, \" I am greatly mistaken if this war does not turn out far more murderous and sanguinary, than any we have hitherto witnessed. Unless Europe shall consent to be united against this aggression, in six months' time there will not be such a thing as a legiti mate sovereign on any of its thrones.\" Buonaparte's escape produced little or no sensation at Venice, as it had been foreseen for a long time ; except amongst the few partizans who had lost their employ in consequence of his exile ; and even amongst those individuals, it was looked upon as a sort of desperate deter mination, on the part of Buonaparte, to die nobly, rather than tamely to submit to outlive, in 2 a 3"], [398, "358 VENICE. f a pitifully small island, his former unequalled grandeur. But, to return to my subject. That I am no advocate for the Napoleon system of legislation, I think I have pretty plainly shown. I have many weighty reasons for regretting, that it should ever have predominated in Italy, and especially in the once flourishing and happy Venetian States. Truth, however, compels me at the same time to declare, and it would indeed be the height of folly to deny the fact, that the French sway was infinitely more con genial, and more generally advantageous, to all classes of the people of Italy, than the system of government which the Austrians have or ganized for them. It was Buonoparte's constant practice to em ploy thousands of the labouring poor on the high roads; not as they now are engaged, from necessity, in waylaying and in plundering the unoffending traveller, but in keeping those roads in good order, and in repairing the forti fications and the public buildings. The re venues of the Venetian states were principally spent by the French amongst the inhabitants, in affording encouragement to the fine arts, in \u00a3*% erecting schools for the education of youth, in maintaining academies for men of science and"], [399, "359 VENICE. \u25a0\u2022\u00ab literature, and in giving salaries to persons of the bar, for devising means for the more prompt administration of justice. Napoleon, too, whenever an author had the good fortune to meet with a Mec\u00e6nas ready to present a work to him, and to say a good word in behalf of the writer, would, as I have before observed, always take a hundred or two copies, and never fewer than fifty, on his own private account ; besides making his staff sub scribe for another hundred, by way of giving encouragement to literature. With the present Emperor of Austria, however, and with some of his brothers \u2014 who certainly understand crusca mente, the meaning of the verb avere, but not the meaning of the verb dare\u2014 the only return they make to a poor author on such an occasion, is a letter of thanks \u2014 that is to say, soddisfanno tutti gli Artisti, dmodoloro, con grazie\u2014 which said grazie, as all the world knows, is very unsub stantial diet ! During the Emperor of Austria's first visit to Venice, as the sovereign of those territories? he accepted every thing, of every\" description, that was presented to him, without once loosening his purse-strings. In short, there was a most striking difference, in this respect, between the It * _ . ** \u00bb . X *"], [400, "360 V E NICE. two Emperors ; for Napoleon was really gene rous in these matters. The same difference appears also to have existed between Napoleon and a certain great hero of our own country. I have been credibly informed \u2014 and the fact can be contradicted if it be untrue \u2014 that a lady, who had written a work in this country, in honour of the illustrious per son's numerous gallant achievements, applied, when it was ready for publication, to an honour able officer, who not only kindly subscribed to the work himself, but used his influence with the hero of it, to procure the lady in question the honour of personally presenting it to the Con queror of the Conqueror. The day for so doing was fixed. The au thoress was received by the first captain of the age in the most gentlemanly and benignant manner. Most unequivocally did he express his grateful acknowledgments to the lady, for the time and the attention which she had be stowed on her narrative of his warlike exploits. He complimented her highly on the manner in which it was executed ; and, on conducting her to the door, he furthermore expressed his earnest desire, to know in what way it was in his power to compensate her for all her trouble."], [401, "361 V E N I C E. The work was published. It had the high honour of being dedicated, by permission, to His Gracious Majesty, King George the Fourth, as well as to his Royal Highness the Duke of York and Albany. The too sanguine authoress had caused it to be got up in the most splendid style of printing. But, alas ! she soon found, that to promise was one thing, but that to take the work and pay for it was another ! To be brief. The result was, that the lady became cruelly embarrassed, inconsequence of the heavy expense she had incurred in her humble attempt to immortalize the deeds of the hero in question. In this situation, she made her incarcerated condition known to the consort ofthe said hero. But, proh pudor ! what was her astonishment at finding the copy of her work sent back to her, by the wife of the hero, after it had been kept six months; and a trifle handed to her, in a degrading manner, through the hands of a common porter at the door of a public office, less in amount, than the sum she received for a single copy, from a sugar-baker in the City ! And this, too\u2014\" tell it not in Gath; publish it not in the streets of Ascalon !\"\u2014 toan unfortunate female, of birth and of education, in a strange country, separated, at the distance of thousands of miles, from her husband and family, without * *'\"'"], [402, "362 VENICE. friends, and without any other resources, for the moment, than those which she might derive from the exercise of her talents ; since she had recently been shipwrecked in the port of Boulogne, and had thereby become deprived of every thing she possessed in the world ! Napoleon had many crimes to answer for; but the crime of ingratitude towards men of genius and talent was not amongst the number. I am far from being one of his admirers. I am, however, for giving1 the devil his due. If the above harsh treatment of the unfortunate lady in question should, by possibility, have arisen out of accidental negligence or error, the par ties will thank me for thus noticing it. It is never too late to atone for an injury ; especially when that injury has been unintentionally in flicted. Meglio tardo che mai ! The following anecdote will serve to show the opinion of the lower orders of the people of Venice, as to the superiority of the French system of government, over that of the Aus- trian. One of those lively set of fellows called the Barcqjuoli, on being reprimanded by his master, for his marked indifference towards the present order of things, and\" threatened with \u25a0 being discharged, if he obstinately persevered in jicjt b^nff recwiciled to the new government,\" \u2022- 4* \u00ab...-\u00ab**'. \u2022 *"], [403, "363 VENICE. was asked, how he could forget the plunderings which his countrymen had experienced from Massina, Lecchi, and others, during the reign of the French, whom he was so partial to ? \" O ! yes,\" replied the man. \" I very well recollect their d \u2014 d system of equality in put ting your excellency on a level with me, but in not raising me to an equality with your excel lency : but then, the French did every thing with such a good grace, and at least, left behind them manure for the land ; but as for these cursed Germans, they eat up our provisions \u2014 suspect our honesty \u2014 pay no one a livre \u2014 ill treat us \u2014 and would empty the very temples of Cloacina, send off their contents to their own country, and deprive us of the means of culti vating our fields, if thev could do so without any cost to themselves !

I should be extremely sorry to be dis charged from your generous service ; yet, if I were forced to starve for it, I could never make up my mind to serve a nation, which has basely made a purchase of my native country.

The whole of the south of Italy passes under the denomination of the kingdom of Naples. It is of considerable extent ; abounds in every necessary as well as luxury of life ; and, but for the mutual benefit and convenience to be de rived from commerce, stands in need of nothing from its neighbours ofthe apostolic states. VOL. II. B"], [420, "2 NAPLES. From the extreme mildness of its climate, and the salubrity of its air, the inhabitants require little or no animal food. They live, therefore, principally on fish, maccaroni, cheese, vegetables, salted pork, and sausages; and, though wine is to be met with in great abun dance and at a very reasonable rate, it seldom or never happens that a Neapolitan is seen in the streets in a state of intoxication. The Neapolitans are more attached to their country than any other Italians, and not less so to their masters or employers ; though they are generally looked upon as great votaries of Mercury, the god of fraud and of theft. The common people, and the domestics of both sexes, sleep and cook their provisions on the staircases of their master's palaces. They live with their families like beasts in a stable ; are excessively dirty in their persons ; and wear scarcely any clothing in their early youth. They are extremely slothful and super stitious j and are at least a couple of centuries behind the rest of Italy, in the point of civiliza tion. The Neapolitan nobility, when they either build or rent a palace, never dream of providing offices for their servants -, but leave them to shift for themselves, in the best way they can. Ferdinand, their sovereign, speaks the same"], [421, "3 NAPLES. corrupted Neapolitan dialect that is used by the common people ; and in his manners, cus toms, habits, and conversation, is to all intents and purposes as much one of the lazzaroni, as any of his subjects. It is to this very similarity of habits and pursuits, that he was indebted for the greater portion of his popularity. As Gene ral Acton, his tall minister, once observed, *-' Ferdinand is a good sort of man, because nature has not supplied him with the faculties necessary to make a bad one.\" The character of the natives may be pretty fairly collected, from the title page to a book, which gives an account ofthe revolution against the tyranny of one of the viceroys of Naples, headed by the famous Massaniello, the fisher man, which runs thus : \u2014 \" the Seventeenth Revolution of the most faithful Subjects of his Sicilian Majesty.\" The eighteenth, however, took place, sanctioned by the king of this ver satile people ; and Ferdinand himself, at Lay bach, occasioned the nineteenth, against these \" his most faithful subjects;\" who have, in con sequence, totally revolutionized their once un bounded love, into complete and entire hatred. This measure is, however, considered to have been forced upon Ferdinand, by the self-created and arbitrary tribunal erected at Laybach, b 2"], [422, "4 NAPLES. which sat in judgment on the future destinies of a great portion of the inhabitants of civilized Europe ; and therefore to have justified him in declaring, that \" he swore to adhere to the new order of things dictated to him, because, by refusing to do so, his personal safety would have been endangered ; that he was ever averse to any change taking place in the government of his kingdom ; and solely agreed to the establish ment of a parliament in Sicily, because it was at that time under the controul of Lord William Bentinck.\" This same parliament, however, since the Austrians have taken possession of the country, has been abolished. The question still remains to be solved, whe ther it would have been wiser and more honour able, in an independent sovereign like Ferdinand, to have submitted to the arbitrary dictatorship ot' a self-styled \" Holy Alliance,\" of three foreign powers, and to have depended on their armies for a precarious and odious existence, or to have become a limited, constitutional king, without any personal responsibility? Time will most probably convince him, which of the alternatives he ought to have embraced ; if, indeed, he be not already instructed thereon. It has been repeatedly found, that on account of the turbulent and boisterous manner in which"], [423, "5 NAPLES. the Neapolitan troops conduct themselves, when marching in a body, whereby they make known their approach, long before they come in contact with the enemy, no operations of a secret nature can be entrusted to them. Unless, therefore, they are drafted into different foreign corps, or mixed up with well-disciplined regiments, it would be hazardous to trust them ; since, both from their strong propensity to plunder and to run away, especially when left to fight by them selves on their own soil, little can be expected from them when isolated from other troops, and commanded by native officers, in whom they have no confidence. In short, the Neapolitan soldiers never fought, under their own banners, for Ferdinand their king; nor for Murat, when he was dethroned; nor even for their own independence. They may be considered as twin brothers of the Spaniards ; and, a thousand pities it is, that two such delightful countries should be contaminated and cursed by such a pestiferous race ! If I might venture an opinion, I should say, that instead of driving the Turks out of Europe, a step which has been proposed as the surest way of preventing the plague from making any fur ther progress in the civilized world, it would be b 3"], [424, "6 NAPLES. infinitely better to send off the two above-men tioned infected races in their stead ; for no plague can by possibility be more fatal to the progress of civilization, than the dissemination of their deadly infection. With respect to the army, as a plea for the numerous desertions, the old story is adduced, of their want of confidence in their leaders, and their never having seen fire but from the crater of Mount Vesuvius, or in their own kitchens when cooking their much-loved maccaroni ; most of them being recruits who, in their marches, committed such depredations and plunderings, that the Austrian army was actually considered by the people, not as their future oppressors, but as their immediate deliverers. An event, this, which could never have oc curred, if the troops, as had hitherto been the case, had been commanded and led into action by foreign officers. That the Neapolitans are not cowards by nature, we have a well-attested proof, in their having supplied Buonaparte with a body of troops, which, as long as Murat had personally the command of them, proved the most efficient force on which he could depend, both in his ridiculous expedition to Moscow, and in his"], [425, "N A P L E S. 7 precipitate retreat therefrom ; by covering which retreat, they prevented his immediate destruction. I have been informed, that the Neapolitan troops were disbanded by their general, sans ceremonie, as a master would send about his business a servant whom he wished to dismiss ; without making the smallest provision for them, or taking the least precaution for their sub sistence; but leaving them to plunder their way home, without even subaltern officers to regulate their inarches. I have further been assured, that the same genera] greatly terrified and alarmed the king ; imposing upon his credulity exaggerated state ments, to induce him the more readily to sign his consent to the instalment of the new con stitution. The fraud was, however, detected ; and was the occasion of the defection in the civil and military operations, and of the disor ders which afterwards took place, and which still continue to disturb the tranquillity of that beautiful and highly favoured portion of Italy. The Neapolitan cavalry are fine men, even to a proverb ; and, as long as Murat could keep together a few hundreds of them, they would disperse large bodies of Cossacs, who would instantly fly, terrified at their very approach. b 4"], [426, "8 NAPLES. The misfortunes of Italy have been most aptly described in the following sentence: \u2014 \" Troppo bella, e troppo debole .* nata sempre per servir ; vinta o vintrice.\" It has been the cruel and unnatural policy of all her barbarous and brutal invaders, ever since the destruction of the Roman empire, to keep the Italians in a state of internal division ; and Buonaparte, both from his historical information, and his own per sonal experience, was induced to adopt the maxim, \" divide et impera,\" as the only sure means of preserving his usurped dominion, against the powerful and even colossal union which would have been formed against it, had he suffered the seeds which he had brought with him from France, to have ripened in the rich soil of Italy. He, however, thought proper to nip and destroy them in the bud ; but, in so doing, he at the same time nipped and destroyed his own honour and glory, and secured his passage in the good ship Bellerophon, to the barren rock of Saint Helena ; there to reflect in solitude on his own treachery, and on the \" mutability of all human affairs ;\" Leaving a name at which the world grew pale, To point a moral or adorn a tale.\" When Buonaparte first arrived in Italy, he"], [427, "9 NAPLES. entertained most imperfect notions, with regard to the country, and the capability of its inhabi tants. He was speedily, however, made sensible of his error ; and, being an eye-witness of its resources, and of the character of the people, he was soon convinced, that if Italy were once really and virtually united, she would again become the mistress of the civilized world. Whatever the French may say to the contrary, the whole of the fourth division of the army which invaded Russia, was composed of natives of the northern states of Italy, commanded by Prince Eugene Beauharnois ; and it is impos sible for any military man to reflect on their brilliant achievements, without feeling the most enthusiastic admiration for troops who were alone vanquished by those elementary generals, Novembri-off, Decembri-off, Januari-off, and their invincible forces. Since the time of the crossing of the Red Sea by the children of Israel, the Russians are, I believe, the only people who have had the good fortune to b eassisted in their overthrow of an invading enemy, by the elements.* How righ- * I had forgotten our own Elizabeth, who was equally protected by Providence. When the tyrant, Philip the"], [428, "10 NAPLES. teous and just is God in all his ways ! He is, indeed, the best of commanders ; for the accom plishment of his commissions are never thwarted by bribery or corruption. The valour, the constancy, and the courage of the Italian army in Russia, were such as they ever had been in former times, and such as they ever will be, when commanded by bold and skilful generals. And, though the progress of the sacred flame of liberty and independence \u2014 which has never ceased to animate the breasts of every real Italian, from one end of that oppressed country to the other, \u2014 may, for a time, have been impeded* I can by no means bring myself to believe, that it is extinguished. In justification of their several unsuccessful military operations, let me adduce a few facts. Second of Spain, attempted the invasion of this happy country, His whole Armada of collected sail, Was, by a roaring tempest on the flood, Both scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.' On that occasion the eye of Heaven watched over the sea-girt isle, and protected her, and I trust ever will do, against the designs of violence, oppression, tyranny, and injustice."], [429, "11 NAPLES. Ever since the year 1793, the armies of the Emperor of Austria have been taught in the school of defeat ; in the same way as the Russian armies were in the time of Peter the Great. A circumstance this, whicb, above all others, is the most fatal to national courage. Yet I do not, on that account, seek to withhold from them the full measure of their deserts. The greater part of them are fine men ; but to the full as much savages as the Cossacks are ; most of them being either Croats, Dalmatians, Hun garians, Poles, or Albanians ; and all of them natives of uncivilized regions. They submit to strict discipline, and are by no means deficient in military ardour. What they stand in need of are motive and zeal ; for at present they are little better than brute machines, utterly desti tute of that energy and that high spirit of honour, which alone can prompt an army to deeds of mighty enterprize, and which indeed can alone be arrived at, from the valour of free nations, fighting in the righteous cause of liberty and independence. Neither am I willing to allow, that the smallest glory has been acquired by the Austrian troops, in making themselves masters of the kingdom of Naples ; a country that had been left unpro tected ; that was divided by internal commo-"], [430, "12 NAPLES. tions ; that was open, on all sides, to their over- whelming forces ; and that was incapable of making any resistance, in consequence of the disbanding of the national forces, by their un- worthy leaders \u2014 in whose school the Spanish Generals, on a recent occasion, no doubt studied the science of cowardice ; and the French army copied the German example, of conquering a people \u2014 without striking a blow ! Sed respice finem ! Let us watch the end of these puff and paste operations ; when we shall, I trust, be able to give the world a more faithful account of the real state of things, than is to be found in the pompous and high-sounding narratives, which fill us with columns of smoke ; which will not, I fear, be dispersed, until the Austrians shall have been compelled to withdraw themselves from the states of Piedmont, Naples, and Sicily, and return to their native homes. Then, and then only, will the real sentiments of the natives of Italy be allowed to circulate freely. Such a step, at the present crisis, would endanger their honour, the liberty they are looking forward to, and their lives ; as every thing is to be feared, while they continue under the immediate con troul of a military force, the greater part of which are feudal slaves, having no notion of"], [431, "13 NAPLES. civilization beyond the satisfying the common wants of brute nature, and being altogether insensible to the feelings of humanity and honour ; and still less to those sentiments of pure patriotism, which warm the heart of every free-born subject with the love of national glory. This melancholy fact is sufficiently apparent from the history of their numerous campaigns, ever since their first invasion of Italy, under the veteran Wurmser ; that ill-fated general, who, with the whole of his army, were compelled to shut themselves up in Mantua, while Buona parte's hordes \u2014 for they were little better \u2014 were encamped, destitute of tents, in the open air ; without a fortress to cover their retreat, without provisions to support themselves in their present station, and without the means of advancing. These are facts which cannot be contradicted; and Marshal Alvinzi, being unacquainted with the topographical situation of the country, un supplied with maps, excepting a very incorrect one, which, to save expense, he had procured in a small village, was therefore reduced to the necessity, with an army of 20,000 men, for want of a proper line of march, to act upon the defensive, to prevent desertion. Wurmser might"], [432, "14 NAPLES. therefore have reversed the observation of the troops after the battle of the Boyne, \" Let us change generals, and we will fight the battle over again ;\" and might justly have said, \"Let me change soldiers with Buonaparte, and I am sure of gaining the victory.\" Indeed, military skill was never more thrown away than in those times, when ruses de guerre overcame regular military tactics \u2014 a mode of warfare which the low, mean, and avaricious conduct of Alvinzi fully justified ; and to which, in his turn, he was obliged to have recourse, to prevent his head-quarters and valuable stores from falling into the hungry jaws of the French ; but which he as little understood as he did the art of conquering. His operations reminded one of the conduct of the deaf cook, who, on being desired to make a dumpling, set about breaking the eggs to make a pancake ; so that at last it became a common saying among the French troops, \" Allons, mes enfans, Alvinzi bat les \u0153ufs, et Buonaparte fait l'omelette.\" To execute one of these left-handed ruses de guerre, Alvinzi contrived to send a trusty pea sant; who engaged to explore the enemy's position, their probable movements, and their precise strength, which was uniformly exagge rated, to the extent at least of one-third. This"], [433, "15 NAPLES. man was sometimes absent from his wife and family for days together, at the risk of his life. Upon one occasion, he brought back with him the most satisfactory as well as useful intel ligence ; for which extraordinary service, he was rewarded with the enormous sum of two Venetian ducats \u2014 about eighteen shillings ster ling ! This want of generosity to such a man, and on such an occasion, was the cause of the complete overthrow of the Austrian army ; for never afterwards could it procure the smallest intelligence to be depended upon. The positions of every one of the battles, in point of ground, were infinitely more advanta geous to Wurmser than they were to Buona parte. But even impregnable situations were given up and abandoned by these troops, with a nonchalance which proved them to be as in sensible to their own fame, as they were to the cause of their country. The battles of Lodi, of Arcole, of Bergamo, of Brescia, of Verona, of the defiles of the Brenta, and of the passage ofthe Bochetta, the key of Genoa, are all strik ing examples, that cover them with eternal dis honour."], [434, "C ic ) CHAPTER II.

Every circumstance detailed by me, in the preceding chapter, has been collected by one who was frequently an eye-witness of the ope rations of both armies, both of the Austrians and of the French in Italy ; and who was some times within gunshot of the scene of action. From education, as well as from moral feelings, I am incapable of exaggeration in favour of the French ; neither am I an advocate for the debased principles of the revolutionists of that"], [435, "17 NAPLES. country. I say \" debased,\" because the natural character of that nation, under all its various forms of government, has invariably tended to the same end \u2014 namely, that of invading every other country, and of contaminating it with their vile doctrines ; and which conduct has been one of the principal reasons why France, in her turn, has been ultimately overrun, sub dued, humiliated, and conquered, by nations the most barbarous and the most uncivilized in all Europe. I received my early education in that once polite and polished country. I know the French, when esteemed good, to have been good for nothing \u2014 but themselves ! France is per haps the only country in Europe, which esti mates foreign talents and foreign productions, not by their intrinsic value or merits, but merely as they are calculated to be useful to herself. A Frenchman can discover no worth in any thing that is not the growth of his own soil. If any one were to talk to a Frenchman on the perfections of paradise, he would immediately turn on his heel and exclaim, \" Mais, Monsieur, ce n'est rien en comparaison de Paris !\" though he had, perhaps, never seen that much-vaunted capital, nor gone beyond the barrier of his own miserable town. vol. n. c"], [436, "18 NAPLES. As an impartial writer, and an eye-witness of most of the events which took place at that memorable period, I nevertheless feel myself bound in candour to confess, that the French in Italy carried every thing before them, in consequence of their being, in character, in manners, in language, and in conduct, more congenial to the habits and disposition of the polished Italians, than the rude, uncultivated, insolent, and braggart Austrians ; who had no other object in view, but that of carrying with them out of the provinces they govern, every thing they could get, without spending therein a single stiver. Nor, until the Italians are either brutalized down to the German manners, or the Germans raised up to the civilization of the enlightened Italians, can there be any approach to a cordial understanding between them. The man who flatters himself to the contrary must be totally ignorant of that mutual dislike which has, which still does, and which ever must subsist between nations so totally uncongenial in their natures. To the cause I have already assigned may be attributed the astonishing defeats of the Aus trians, under General Melas, their loss of all Italy, and the enthusiastic joy with Avhich the people of that country received the conqueror,"], [437, "19 NAPLES. after one of the most unaccountable and most complete routs that ever was heard of. It would, indeed, be far beyond my humble abili ties to describe the universal sensation of delight which it occasioned. It can better be con ceived, than described by the feeble pen of a female ; though her heart beats warm in the cause of the injured. The following anecdote will illustrate still further the amazing difference between the spirit which sets in motion a mass of feudal slaves, and that which actuates an army of free born soldiers : for such the French troops were, or at least considered themselves to be ; as Buonaparte had not, at that time, chilled their military ardour, by throwing over it the wet blanket of Imperialism \u2014 though the army was, of necessity, the only class, in his extended empire, which did not immediately feel the weight of those fetters that galled the rest of his subjects. I was myself coming from Genoa on the very day upon which the battle of Marengo took place. The overflow of the Scrivia hin dered me from proceeding, and obliged me to stop at an inn, at no great distance from the field of action. We had scarcely alighted from our carriage, and were coolly taking a lun- c 2"], [438, "20 NAPLES. cheon, when a French officer entered, who was flying to prepare horses for the escape of Buo naparte, who was then closely pursued by the Germans. This officer must have been well known to the innkeeper, as he greatly interested himself in procuring him a disguise, the more effectually to forward his immediate escape. The French drums were beating the retreat. He entered the room in which we were sitting, and exclaimed, \"Sauvez moi; sauvez moi : tout est perdu!\" We entreated him to sit down and tranquillize himself, until the landlord should return with the clothes which were to disguise him. It was with much difficulty that we could prevail on him not to take off his uniform and throw it into the cistern. But, whilst we were assuring him, that as soon as the flood subsided we would give him a seat in our car riage, where he would be safe to pursue his journey, the town was suddenly filled with the French troops, and the whole country resounded with shouts, that the French had gained the battle. In a short time after a division entered, bearing the colours of the victors. The afore said officer nearly fainted at this unexpected turn in the wheel of dame Fortune ; and, think ing no more of us, he flew, with the rapidity of lightning, put on his uniform, belted on his"], [439, "21 NAPLES. sword, embraced several of the soldiers, and was instantly out of sight, in quest of the head quarters of Buonaparte. It was afterwards reported to us at Novarra, where we stopped several days, that General Melas had engaged the French with 20,000 men, and had then in reserve at least 10,000 fresh troops, who had never been brought into action, and were only waiting his orders. The reason assigned for his not employing them was, his having discovered some treachery, or a want of courage, amongst those who had been com manded by other officers ; and that to save himself, as well as the few who had fought and remained faithful to him, from being cut to pieces by French enthusiasm, he had entered into a capitulation with Buonaparte, and given up to him all the strong fortresses in Italy. Thus was this beautiful country, a second time, in the complete possession of the French ! As reverses, and contre-temps like these so repeatedly befel the Austrian armies under the command of this scientific, accomplished, and experienced master in the art of man-kilring, what could reasonably be expected from the undisciplined hordes of Lazzaroni, and the young and inexperienced Piedmontese, seduced by one, and betrayed by the other, as they were c 3"], [440, "22 NAPLES. accustomed to be while engaged in the heat of battle ? Had the regiments of either of the last-mentioned troops been commanded by vete ran chiefs, uninfluenced by self-interest or by self-preservation, convinced am I, that they would never have been found to have aban doned their standards. This extraordinary stroke of decided good fortune, so soon after Buonaparte's return to France from his ill-fated Egyptian expedition, was the grand spring that put in motion and gave birth to, the conqueror's adoption of a totally new career. He no longer openly avowed himself to be a votary of democracy ; on the contrary, he became the declared advocate of his long-sighed-for plan of reviving the aris tocratical system, by vaccinating his own worthy Ajaccian family with the pus of monarchy ; and thus did he attain, step by step, that eminence of oligarcical imperialism, which eventually turned out so fatal to him ! The first experiment was tried, and with complete success, on that poor, ricketty-framed footstool of a prince, the King of Etrutria ; whose untimely death left a widowed Queen to further the good work of king-making. It was proposed that she should be honoured, by being made the better half, encircled with a crown,"], [441, "23 NAPLES. of Lucien Buonaparte, his brother ; but the Spanish soil not being propitious for Corsican seed, the tree of liberty was rooted up, to give place to the tree of kings. The fruit it pro duced were the crowns of Bavaria, of Wurtem berg, of Westphalia, of Spain, and of Naples ; besides many other lesser dignities for princes and princesses, and dukes and duchesses. So well did the tree flourish in the soil of Austria, that it brought a little king to a great nation ; and, peradventure, if this said tree had not been blighted in its growth, eventually it might have become the tree of all trees. It has often been asserted, that Lucien Buo naparte could never be prevailed on to repudiate his lawful wife. But, previously to this, his brother Napoleon had shewn his propensity for the aristocracy, by uniting his sister Pauline, the widow of General Le Clerc, to the Roman prince, Camillo Borghese ; now the cher ami of the pretty Duchess of Lanti. Napoleon's next attempt at royal inocula tion was upon Eugene Beauharnois, whom he joined to the Princess Amelia Augusta, daughter of the King of Bavaria ; and by which alliance he succeeded in detaching that sovereign from the interest of Austria. c 4"], [442, "24 NAPLES. The third royal alliance was brought about by compelling his brother Jerome to divorce his wife, the rich and beautiful Miss Patterson, and to honour the hand of the Princess Cathe rine, eldest daughter of the Duke of Wurtem berg ; whom he made King of Wurtemberg, as he did Jerome of Westphalia : both which king doms were of the Buonaparte manufactory. By these alliances he greatly strengthened his fron tier interest in Italy ; towards France on one side, and towards Austria on the other. The next batch from the Buonaparte oven was the elevation of his brother Joseph to the throne of Naples ; and afterwards, on his over throwing king, queen, prince, and minister, making him the short-lived monarch of Spain . His brother Louis, and his favourite daughter in-law, Hortensia Beauharnois, were saddled, as king and queen, upon the phlegmatic Dutch, by whom they were much beloved ; for Louis was not a king of the olden times, but did every thing in his power to propitiate their welfare and happi ness ; which, as they give out, had not been greatly promoted either by the Prussian blue, or the Russian flax. Next come our dearly-beloved sisters, Pau lina, Eliza, and Caroline ; who were all three"], [443, "25 NAPLES. converted either into queens, or princesses, or grand-duchesses. Last, \" though not least in our royal favour,\" come the minor branches of the Great Family, Stephanie de Beauharnois, married to the Grand- Duke of Baden, and consequently become Grand-Duchess, and Mademoiselle Tescher, made Princess d'Aremberg ; both nieces of the Empress Josephine. Neither Lucien nor Joseph Buonaparte choos ing to barter plebeian flesh and blood for king doms and crowns, by separating from their lawful spouses, Napoleon thought fit to throw off the mask, and finally, to complete the climax of his unbounded ambition, repudiated Jose phine, for the purpose of marrying the Arch- Duchess Maria Louisa, daughter of the Em peror of Austria; which marriage was like a de prqfundis to a departed soul. By this one act, he obscured all his former brilliant achieve ments. It has been asserted, that of all the alliances which he formed, the one that flattered Buona parte's vanity the most, was his own ; and that after he had lost the battle of Waterloo, this relationship struck him as the one on which he couldbestrely. As he knew he was muchin favour with the Queen Dowager of Wurtemberg and his"], [444, "26 NAPLES. sister-in-law, who were both nearly allied to the Court of Great Britain, he flattered himself that, by their interest, and the influence of Lord Holland in the House of Peers, he should be suffered to come to London and remain in Eng land ; in the same way that his brother Lucien had been during his exile. Indeed, it is be lieved, that his family were divided between England and Austria, and that he himself put an end to their doubts, by saying, \" I am deter mined not to go to Austria, who has betrayed me : I will throw myself on England ; at least for the present.\" When Lady Holland and family were at Venice, she told a lady, who called on his Lord ship, from the respect which she bore to the memory of his uncle, the immortal Charles Fox, in the presence of Lord Charles Fitzgerald and another English gentleman, that the reason why the Queen Dowager of Wurtemberg was not permitted to come to England, was because of her known partiality for Napoleon, and her hav ing been the prime agent in bringing about the marriage of the Princess Catherine with Jerome Buonaparte. From the very moment of his taking the name of Napoleon, he became the mere shadow of his former self. Had he but remained firmly at-"], [445, "27 NAPLES. tached to the pure and sturdy principles of republicanism, the savage and despotic seeds of the North would never have over-run the soil of the South ; that soil which had been bathed with the rich blood of liberty. He not only disgusted every member of his own family, from the humiliations to which he subjected them, in consequence of his marrying this second Empress ; but he alienated from himself the affections of the whole French na tion. Nor was this new wife more disliked for the haughty demeanour with which she con ducted herself at court, than for the simple fact of her having ascended a throne, the foot steps of which had been stained with the blood of her grand-aunt. For though Maria Louisa bore but a faint, a very faint, resemblance to the once most beautiful and most amiable of her sex, the sight of her, in that very place where Marie Antoinette had filled, occasioned many a bitter pang in the bosoms of some of her cruel persecutors. The most confidential friends of Buonaparte, in their endeavours to justify this second mar riage, have affirmed, that his motive was not so much the having an heir to his throne ; as he had long before settled that that heir should be the son of his favourite daughter-in-law, Hortensia"], [446, "28 NAPLES. Beauharnois ; who, in compliance with his wishes, had united herself to his brother Louis ; whom he afterwards created King of Holland, and whose son, though an infant, was then at Paris, for the purpose of being educated under Napoleon's immediate eye. In case of the death of this youth, Eugene Beauharnois was to have been the successor to the throne of France. He however deceived both of them, and made them his private enemies, by divorcing their mother Josephine and marrying Maria Louisa ; which he was induced to do, in order to unite himself the more firmly with Austria, against Russia, as well as to detach the Queen of Na ples from the influence of England ; which he hoped thereby to accomplish. There can be no doubt that his conduct was as strongly stimulated by these political consi derations, as it was by private ambition, to be come allied to the House of Austria ; to which ambition he fell a victim, from the enslaving and benumbing effects which it had upon all his other faculties ; his whole conduct, both public and private, having, from the moment he be came the husband of Maria Louisa, undergone a total change. It is well known, that scarcely had this mar-"], [447, "29 NAPLES. riage been consummated, before a private cor respondence, of the most affectionate and flat tering description, was entered upon, by emis saries from the court of France to that of Naples. What effect it produced, I leave Lord William Bentinck to disclose, as well as the conduct which he pursued after he had been put in pos session of the fact. That Buonaparte intended to remove Murat from Naples, there remains not a shadow of a doubt. Salicetti was sent thither for the express purpose ; and his monstrous plunderings and dilapidations were winked at, in order to under mine Murat' s popularity. This man was one of the principal agents of all Buonaparte's pri vate intrigues ; and, by the unlimited resources which he was suffered to have at his disposal, he became a successful agent in realizing his mas ter's gigantic projects. It was Buonaparte's intention to have created two new kingdoms in the North, by way of checks upon Austria and Russia ; one between Prussia and Russia, including the whole of Poland ; the other between Russia and Sweden, including some islands in the Baltic, as well as all Finland. One of these kingdoms was in tended for Murat, by way of compensation for consenting to give up Naples : while, to some of"], [448, "30 NAPLES. the members of the court of Palermo, he held out the language of conscience, with regard to the justice of their claims ; and, as drowning men are apt to catch at straws, they were drawn into the snare, from an over sanguine hope of recovering Naples : and, from the long wished for idea of shaking off the English yoke in Sicily, did they thus become the victims of their own credulity. That a correspondence was carried on be tween Buonaparte, Murat, the Salicetti agents, and some members of the court of Palermo, is very certain : and, if the Queen should have been one of them, it would indeed be surpris ing ; since, at various critical periods of the French revolution, the author of these pages has had the honour of conversing with this extraordinary lady, and on every occasion she was wont to express her abhorrence, not only of French interference in the island, but of the whole French nation, ever since the horrid mur der of her sister, Marie Antoinette, at Paris, on the 15th of October 1793, a day which she always held in sad remembrance ! That her majesty should have suffered herself to be over ruled, can alone be attributed to the all-seducing desire of reigning ; in the hope of avenging herself on the enemies who had calumniated"], [449, "NAPLES. 31 and dethroned her. For that, and that alone, could possibly have so blinded a woman of her astonishing sagacity, as to have induced her to give credence to the assertions of one, whose thirst after universal dominion had exceeded the limits of his own vast calculations ; and who, besides, had always been her most impla cable enemy. Buonaparte's views of aggrandizement were unlimited ; and, in this want of limits to his am bition, is to be discovered the real cause of the non-duration of his power. Without a key-stone a building must fall under its own weight. I happened to be at Paris in the year 1 803, whenBuonaparte was made First Consul, and was introduced to his mother, Madame Letitia. I complimented the old lady on the good fortune and great talents of her son : to which she replied, in a very affable manner, \" Bless me, Madame ! do you fancy that a First Consulship will satisfy him ? O, no : the world is too small for the vast notions of my son.\" But, it is time for me to return to the affairs of Naples."], [450, "32 CHAPTER III. NAPLES.

All the Neapolitans now residing in London, who have been actively employed in the revo lution sanctioned by their sovereign, and who have only been able to find a shelter from per secution in this land of hospitality, declare,"], [451, "33 NAPLES. most solemnly, that in order to serve his own selfish purposes, one of the revolutionary gene rals (now also in this country) grossly deceived the King of Naples, by so exaggerating the numbers of the mal-contents, as to induce him, through intimidation, to hasten the organization of tlie new constitution, merely for the purpose of thereby securing his own safety ; fancying, from the versatile disposition, and the love of revolutions, \" delftdelissimo popolo di sua maestu delle due Sicilie,\" that, when out of danger and at a distance from Naples, he could revoke at pleasure those acts which the turbulent spirit of the moment had compelled him to sanction. After the king had sworn to maintain the constitution, and the troops had returned to Naples, under the command of General Pepe, headed by the first lieutenant Morelli, and the second lieutenant Silvati, those officers, for their noble and valorous conduct, were proclaimed generals of the army by the whole population. This the government took no no tice of; but, on its being repeated, and the people becoming more clamorous against those of their generals whom they considered as traitors, these two heroes, in order to save the lives of the king and royal family, then in mo mentary jeopardy, nobly came forward and VOL. II. D"], [452, "34 NAPLES. declined the offer ; saying, that what they had done had been solely with a view to the public good, and that they looked for no reward be yond the heart-felt satisfaction of meriting the esteem of their countrymen. For this disin terested conduct they were universally applaud ed, and tranquillity was restored. Notwith standing this, on the king being reinstated by the Austrians, in his absolute power, he ordered those two honourable men to be tried by a mili tary commission of foreign officers ; which com mission condemned them to an ignominious death, and both of them were consequently hanged as traitors. Ferdinand's differences on political matters with the Crown Prince have long been the source of domestic feuds between them and his second son, Prince Leopold, the avowed favou rite ofthe old king ; and who, in consequence of his marriage with his niece, Maria Clemen tina, the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, has, with his father's consent, been carrying on intrigues at Naples, endeavouring to set aside the right of his elder brother, and to get himself declared heir to the crown in his stead. These are facts well known to many persons of the court, as well as to the nation ; and their plans would have succeeded, had not their abo-"], [453, "35 NAPLES. minable intrigues been discovered; as would also their attempts to have the Crown Prince car ried off, at different times, by poison, had it not been for the stir it occasioned amongst the people, by whom he is deservedly esteemed and beloved, for the liberal sentiments he entertains on all political matters. On the last disturb ance breaking out, he would certainly have been the first victim of popular fury, had the people not been convinced, from the way in which he was exposed to their rage, that he had been, equally with themselves, betrayed by his father and Prince Leopold ; though his filial and fra ternal affections prevented him from accusing either, and induced him, at the risk of his own life, to stand the brunt of every charge. All which conduct, however, has only still further established him in the love and esteem of the whole nation. The first false step of the Neapolitans may with justice be attributed to their allowing their newly-created constitutional king to absent him self from the seat of his government, and suffer ing him to be arraigned like a criminal, at the bar of a dictatorial self-created tribunal, consist ing of three absolute sovereigns ; to which humiliation he never would have consented, but d 2"], [454, "36 NAPLES. in the secret expectation of regaining that abso lute authority, to which he had been accus tomed from his infancy, and which he had con stantly exercised in his own right, or by proxy, for the space of nearly sixty years. It is there fore scarcely possible to imagine, that he could have been brought spontaneously to sanction the annihilation of his own power, but from dire necessity. Finding himself in a perilous situation, from a variety of circumstances, he joined his voice to that of the major part of his subjects, of all ranks, in favour of a free constitution, and yielded to the public will, through fear and not from choice. It was therefore naturally to be expected that, when out of danger, he would, from sheer pusillanimity, make his formal recan tation before this magnanimous tribunal of his acknowledged judges, and pay implicit obedi ence to its fiats, with as much ease and indiffer ence, as he had sworn to proclaim and defend the free constitution. Antecedently to the time of Charles the First of England, \u2014 who, at least, had some virtues, to redeem his want of good faith \u2014 the word of a king was looked upon as sacred, even to a pro verb : but, the glorious light of truth has dissi-"], [455, "NAPLES 37 pated the ignorant enchantment, and has shewn them to be mere mortals, subject to all the weaknesses of frail human nature. The king's quitting Naples was alike the death-blow of the constitution and of his own popularity. From that moment he lost the pub lic confidence ; and he has been indebted ever since, for his personal safety, to the foreign troops of that very sovereign, to whom he had sacrificed the liberty of his subjects, and his own independence ; and for the commission of which crime he has been condemned, in his old age, to seek refuge in a barren northern clime, there to eke out the brief remainder of his mise rable existence. With what reason then could it be expected, when the head of the nation, as well as the par liament at Naples, had deserted the sacred cause which they had sworn to defend, that the newly raised corps of Lazzaroni would be more firm in their conduct, on the approach of their hun gry and mercenary invaders \u2014 that they would leave their homes and their darling maccaroni, for the chance of being butchered, in the cause of a set of constitutional poltroons, who had no one object in view but the safety of their own dear selves ? d 3"], [456, "38 NAPLES. Ridiculous as some of these remarks may, primd facie, appear to those who are unacquaint ed with the character of these Lazzaroni, it is nevertheless a fact too notorious to be called in question, that one and all of them abandoned the cause which they had enthusiastically sworn to die for, or succeed in defending. It is even asserted, that on their being repulsed in their first engagement with the invaders, one of their own generals ordered them to retreat. Thousands, therefore, of these desperadoes were let loose on the country, with much less precaution, than a gentleman would bestow on discharging the meanest domestic. Like famished wolves, they prowled about in every direction, robbed every individual, and gutted every cot tage they passed. They laid hold of every thing that came in their way ; but cascia cavallo and maccaroni were the first objects of their plunder : these they carried off from the poor peasants by wholesale. The disbanding of troops in this way had, I believe, been never before resorted to by any civilized nation ; and is without a parallel in ancient or modern history. It has been said, that these disorders took place from the want of military magazines and regular com missaries. The fear of their returning to Na-"], [457, "39 NAPLES. pies, and thereby chilling the ardour of the constitutionalists, has also been given out as one of the reasons for their being disbanded and let loose in the interior of the country. Errors of such magnitude as these are only to be excused, on the score of their having arisen out of an over-heated imagination, occa sioned by the victory they had obtained over the king, in getting him to consent to the esta blishment of a constitutional form of govern ment ; by which the liberty of the subject was to be dependent on the laws, and no longer on the caprice of absolute power. And certainly, on minds capable of appreciating the blessing, such a reform must have an astonishing influ ence, when fighting in the sacred cause of liberty, and emancipation from national slavery, under the yoke of a foreigner. Fatal as are the effects of retreat even to veteran troops, to an inexperienced, clamorous, newly-raised mob of Neapolitan Lazzaroni, little better than a horde of thieves, they must be irre trievably ruinous. It is said, that laurelled vic tory will make even cowards brave ; and it is equally certain, that brave men may become cowards for the want of it. A short time after his sister Caroline had d 4"], [458, "40 NAPLES. been married to the present King of Naples, Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, paid him a visit, for the purpose of regulating some points connected with the Neapolitan government. In the course ofthe discussion, the King asked Leopold, how many Neapolitans he had in Tus cany ? The Grand Duke replied, that the question had no relevancy to the subject before them. \" Indeed but it has,\" retorted the King of Naples, \" for I have many thousands of your Tuscan subjects in my dominions ; and that is a pretty plain proof that they like my government better than they do their own ; for when people are happy, and possess the means of obtaining a subistence, they never quit their native land in quest of it.\" If Ferdinand should happen to recollect this anecdote \u2014 and I dare say he does, for monarchs are often found to possess the faculty of reten tion, even when they have no other \u2014 what must be his feelings at being now compelled, in his old age, to leave the delightful scenery and climate of Parthenope, to seek shelter in a bleak, chilling, northerly atmosphere, where, for two-thirds of the year, nature refuses to perform her accustomed functions !

The present King of Naples is the son of Charles the Third of Spain. He was born in January 1751, ascended the throne of Naples in October 1759, on the accession of his father"], [460, "42 NAPLES. to that of Spain, and in April 1768, was mar ried to Caroline of Austria, daughter of the great Maria Theresa ; who was very much dis liked by the Neapolitans, almost as soon as she arrived in that country, and afterwards she became very unpopular, from the superiority of her natural capacity, and the difference of her education. The real cause of the misfortunes which have attended the Queen of Naples may be traced to her mother, the Empress Maria Theresa ; who, by her own example, taught all her daugh ters to govern their husbands : and in so doing she had in view the furtherance of her own political influence. Three of them she married to three weak-headed and feeble-minded princes. All of them were indulgent husbands and good fathers, but too careless and too bigotted for the times in which they reigned, to be consi dered good sovereigns ; and better calculated to adorn the domestic circle, or to be the inmates of a monastery, than to shine as statesmen or political princes. Caroline, therefore, became so excessively anxious to retain her power over the king her husband, that, from the fear of losing it, she was often betrayed into acts of violence, which were repugnant to her natural disposition and"], [461, "43 NAPLES. her cooler judgment ; for this princess really possessed a strong masculine understanding, with great natural and acquired powers of mind, scarcely inferior to those enjoyed by the pro soundest statesman. She had a cool head in council, was capable of forming a just concep tion of things in general, and had acquired a knowledge of men and manners, far exceeding that of her unfortunate sister, Maria Antoinette of France ; who, though she had a greater por tion of the milk of human kindness in her com position than Caroline, possessed a capacity by no means capable of executing any plan that required firmness or perseverence. She never theless had a large share of natural good sense. From the fear of being supplanted, not in the affections of her husband, but in the exercise of her power, the Queen of Naples suspected every female to whom the king paid particular attention. Effectually to prevent such atten tions, she would instantly banish the object of her suspicions, not merely from the court, but from tlie kingdom. For instance \u2014 the last time that Madame Banti, the celebrated singer, performed at the theatre San Carlo, the very night which ter minated her engagement, she was hurried away from the stage to a carriage, and was not allowed"], [462, "44 NAPLES. to go to her lodgings, or even to take any repose, until she had passed the Neapolitan territory, from a fear lest the king should cause her engagement to be renewed. And all this from the motives of jealousy of which I have just spoken. The queen was the favourite sister of the Archduke Leopold, and Maria Antoinette of Joseph the Second of Austria. The latter was much offended with her, for condemning the precipitate manner in which he caused the monasteries and convents to be put down, throughout his dominions. In the body politic, there are certain disor ders which are more readily eradicated by par tial bleedings, than by the sudden application of violent remedies ; whereby there is great danger of not arriving at the desired object. For vices and virtues are the lights and shades of human nature. If all were virtue or all were vice, there would be a total blank in our com position. Cures prudently set about are gene rally attended with success ; for either they effect a radical change, or the patient dies a natural death, and gradually descends to obli vion : whereas, a too sudden shock never fails to leave behind it some lurking mischief. Thus it is with regard to monasteries and"], [463, "45 NAPLES. convents. Wherever they have been suddenly and forcibly suppressed, they have repristinated with redoubled energy ; for we are naturally inclined to forget petty offences, but we never forgive acts of downright violence. Nothing can be more just than the punishment of mur derers : nevertheless, when we behold the cri minal at the place of execution, we forget the crime, and naturally let fall the tear of pity. As far as his heart was concerned, Joseph the Second was justified in suppressing the mo nasteries and convents ; but not so, as it regards his head : for Maria Theresa had already given orders, that all persons who had been forcibly secluded from the world, should, as soon as the fact was established, be absolved from their oaths, and restored to their families. Many abuses of this description had taken place in the course of her reign ; but, whether from neglect or the multiplicity of other politi cal matters, none of the applications in behalf of the persons aggrieved had been attended to. At her death, therefore, all these memorials came under the inspection of her son ; and some of them struck his mind so forcibly, that, without consideration or distinction, he directed all mo nasteries and convents throughout his domi nions to be put down : thereby imitating the"], [464, "46 NAPLES. approved precedent of the renowned Doctor Last ; who, when under examination before the learned College of Physicians, previously to obtaining a diploma, on being asked how he treated his patients in certain cases? replied, \" I give them certain remedies that open both doors ; so that if the disorder does not walk out, it is no fault of mine.\" By so doing, Joseph undoubtedly made some few individuals happy ; but he was soon con vinced of the fatal consequences of the mea sure, when he beheld thousands of miserable objects, deprived thereby of their means of subsistence, becoming chargeable to the state ; and, like Ganganelli for having suppressed the Jesuits \u2014 (who, by the bye, have again started up in all the Catholic countries) \u2014 Joseph was supposed to have paid for it with his life ; as Emperor and Pope are both declared to have been carried off by poison. So perfectly convinced was the Emperor Joseph of his error, that when Pope Pius the Sixth came to Vienna to expostulate with him on his conduct, he determined not to enter on the subject, and, during his stay of six weeks, never afforded his Holiness an opportunity of seeing him, except in public and on court days. Tired, therefore, of waiting, the venerable head"], [465, "47 NAPLES. of the church took his departure for Rome, with the mortification of not having succeeded in the object of his long jousney. Joseph had adopted the principle of Catherine the Second ; namely, never to recede from what had once been decid ed upon, but to persevere in it, through thick and through thin, whether right or whether wrong. Ferdinand's principal minister and tutor was the celebrated Marquis Tenuci : but the pos session of talents, and the capacity of infusing those talents into the minds of others, and espe cially into the minds of absolute princes, are two distinct things ; to which are to be added, Ferdinand's aversion to study, and his exces sive love of amusements ; in which he was cor dially encouraged by the individuals who admi nistered the government during his minority. So that few opportunities were afforded the juve nile monarch of cultivating his intellects ; and, though the most active in the pursuit of amuse ments of all sorts, he was, from habit, the most idle and the most careless with regard to busi ness or mental improvement. Nay, on his mar riage with the Arch-Duchess Caroline of Austria, he scarcely knew how to sign his name ; and that princess was actually the first to teach him"], [466, "48 N API.E S. so to read and to write, as to make himself un derstood. Even after his marriage, so naturally averse was he to occupy himself with the cares of the state, that, at the instance of her mother, the Empress Maria Theresa, Queen Caroline took into her own hands the reins of government, excepting that portion of it which she bestowed on the Marquis Gallo. For so doing, the king being one day displeased with him said, \" Ah, Gallo, Gallo ; se non fosse per quella gal lina d' Austria,\" meaning the Queen, \" vi farei vedere chi sono.\" The Marquis's office soon after devolved on the notorious General Acton, the son of an English doctor, residing in the south of France \u2014 a circumstance which gave birth to the jeu de mot, \" H\u0153c rex, hie regina, hie h\u0153c et hoc Acton.\" That the witty insinua tion was fully justified by facts, will hereafter abundantly appear. As the king was one day hunting in a forest, on some of the crown lands, feeling in want of some refreshments, he entered a cottage belong ing to one of his tenants. After having regaled his royal stomach with a copious supply of bread, onions, maccaroni, cascia cavallo, and what not beside, Ferdinand, by way of return"], [467, "49 NAPLES. for the hospitable reception he had met Avith, renewed the man's lease, and directed him to repair to Naples, to see it carried through the necessary forms ; a duty which then belonged to General Acton's department. Sir William Hamilton and myself happened that day to be breakfasting with the great man. The moment his secretary saw the king's signa ture, he suffered the peasant to pass on to the sactum sanctorum. Upon looking at the in strument, so much did Acton, as secretary of state, feel his importance hurt, by this supposed infringement on his authority, in the king's signing a grant without having previously con sulted him, that he rose from his seat, and, in our presence, tore the paper into a thousand pieces, and flung it in the peasant's face. The poor man stood motionless for some minutes, until at last, recovering himself a little, he looked at us, and exclaimed, with tears in his eyes \u2014 \" Ahime, mama mia, son disperato ! vedete vostra eccellenza, vedete ; lo Re me l'ha fatto ; sottoserivetelo, fe me lo tu pure, per carita :\" \u2014 the king has made it ; for charity's sake, do you sign it also. Acton, out of all patience, taking up a cane, said to the poor fellow, \" If you don't quit the room instantly, I'll break every bone in your body.\" Upon VOL. II. e"], [468, "50 NAPLES. hearing this threat, the peasant, leaving the apartment, exclaimed, \" O ! mi son perduto ; e me ne va d'un re di bastone, a trovar il re di cuore : Addio ; statevene bene, re di bastone vero.\" In Catholic countries, and particularly in Italy, the people make only one meal on the day immediately preceding Christmas day ; and that meal generally takes place after sunset, and consists entirely of fish. I happened to be on a visit to Sir William Hamilton at Caserta, at this precise season of the year, and took oc casion to make some observations on the above conduct of Acton ; which had taken place only a few days before. I observed that, considering the great respect which was paid, in England, to any recommendation coming from the sove reign, I could not possibly conceive why so little regard should be paid to the orders of an absolute monarch. s As soon as I had concluded my observation, Sir William answered me thus \u2014 \" To-morrow, Madam, will be Christmas-eve. To-day, the king is busily engaged in fishing, to supply the market of Naples with fish, for the suppers of his good Catholic subjects to-morrow ; when all the fish which the monarch catches himself, or causes to be caught in his name, he will him-"], [469, "51 NAPLES. self sell in the public market. If you are so dis posed, we will take a drive and see this regal fishmonger, like Solomon, in all his glory ! You will thereby, from ocular demonstration, be able to form your own judgment as to the real cha racter of this king, and of the claims which such a sovereign has to the respect of his sub jects, or of his ministers : though, with all his weaknesses, Ferdinand is allowed to be a good hearted man.\" I accepted the offer ; and accordingly, next morning, Sir William, Lady Hamilton, her mo ther, and myself set off from Caserta for Naples. Arrived there, Sir William and myself alighted, and, leaving the ladies in the carriage, we pro ceeded to the fish-market. And, sure enough, there stood his present majesty, the King of Naples, dressed in a white night-cap, andwith an apron round his waist, selling his fish to the best bidder, surrounded, \" in all his glory,\" by the Lazzaroni, giggling, and eating bread and onions out of their filthy hands, and carrying on with them a conversation, couched in a sort of patois jargon, not a jot less vulgar nor more civilized than their own. A lawyer, whose name has escaped me, ap proached the stall, in the intention of purchasing some of the king's fish. Upon seeing him, his e 2"], [470, "52 NAPLES. majesty, who knew him to be a great miser, asked him considerably more for the fish than he would have done any other person. Upon which, the lawyer offered what he thought was a fair price ; when the king replied to him : \" Go, Mr. Lawyer, and fatten yourself on human dung ; for you shall have no fish at that price, I assure you.\" This was considered as an amazing piece of royal wit, and mightily was it applauded by the surrounding Lazzaroni, and loudly did these \" veritables sans-culottes\" laugh thereat ; for, to say the truth, the greater part of them were nearly in puris naturalibus, and exposed the entire of their filthy members, much more than those execrable wretches did, who first gave birth to the disgusting appella tion. His majesty used to indulge in numerous other amusements, equally singular and peculiar to himself. He would sometimes walk on the beautiful beach at the Chiaja, and, taking up one of these sans-culottes, would throw him, with the greatest violence, into the water \u2014 (per haps the only washing the fellow had ever re ceived) \u2014 and would then jump in after him, and bring him safe on shore. It was this freak of his Neapolitan majesty which gave birth to the im mortal Canova's two figures of Hercules flinging"], [471, "53 NAPLES. Lichon into the sea, now in the possession of the banker Turloni, at Rome. What, then, can rationally be expected from a nation which, for more than half a century, has been taught in such a school, and by such a preceptor ? On the last night of the Carnival, Ferdinand would go to the beautiful theatre San Carlo, and, ordering a dish of maccaroni to be brought him, scalding hot, and mixed up with oil, cheese, beef-gravy and what not, from one of the upper boxes, when the pit was crowded with spectators, all attentive to the opera or ballet, he would throw the greasy mess, by handfuls, on his loving subjects ; and those who wished to be particularly noticed by the monarch, would tumble head over heels, and scramble to pick up some of it to eat. All which the king would heartily enjoy, and would laugh most immoderately at those who appeared concerned and vexed at beholding the unctuous marks of royal favour on their holiday-suits. The queen, who would be sitting in her pri vate box, would generally retire from the front, and now and then peep out, as if she was un willing to shew herself until the kingly sport was all over. As soon as Ferdinand had en tirely got rid of the contents of his dish, he would enter her majesty's box, which was im- e 3"], [472, "54 NAPLES. mediately over the stage, and would there re ceive the most unbounded applauses for the feats he had achieved, and some ofthe Lazzaroni in the pit would hold up to him large pieces of the maccaroni ; upon which he would make the queen step forward to share in the public ap probation bestowed on these his princely amuse ments.

She had been too well educat ed ; her mind had been too much cultivated ; and she discovered too great a contempt for the uncivilized people over whom she was destined"], [473, "55 NAPLES. to reign, and could rarely descend to the vul garity and ignorance of the country. Indeed, she was too refined in her manners, and had too enlarged a capacity, for such a nation. Her judgment, on all matters pertaining to the state, was so correct, that her ministers could not fail to profit by the suggestions she would throw out. During the king's exile, the reign of usurpa tion at Naples was as vicious as it was detri mental to public spirit. The government was confined to the most circumscribed class of the old and new nobility ; and the people in general were precluded from taking a share in the public functions, except in subordinate military situa tions ; for those offices which were attached to the court service, and were of rank, etiquette, power, and effective authority, were solely en trusted to foreigners nominated by Buonaparte. Murat, like all the other kings wTho sprung from the Buonaparte manufactory, was merely an active agent, paying implicit obedience to his commands. None else could retain their situations ; for, if they chanced to be refractory and run restive, they were sure to be thrown out of the saddle of royalty. This government, therefore, was equally vicious, with regard to its organization, as the former had been ; the e 4"], [474, "56 NAPLES. entire executive administration being, as I have observed, confined to the class of the old and the new mushroom nobility, to the total exclu sion of the major part of the nation. To become a member thereof, the principal recommendation consisted in a readiness to sa crifice public virtue to absolute power. And thus were the rights and liberties of a whole people laid prostrate at the will of a circum scribed number of depraved and unprincipled individuals ! I will now relate a few interesting particulars, concerning Queen Caroline's exfle, and her banishment from Palermo and the island of Sicily. On my arrival at Palermo, with a letter of recommendation for her majesty the Queen of Naples, which I had received from a mem ber of her imperial family, I was, to my utter astonishment, informed that she was then in close confinement, until such time as a ship could be got ready to convey her from the island. This was an order from the British comman der-in-chief, in consequence of his having dis covered a correspondence, in which the queen was directly accused of being concerned in a plot, which had for its object the betrayal of"], [475, "NAPLES. 57 the island and of the British troops into the hands of the French. Previously to this accusation ; indeed, imme diately on her arrival at Palermo, with the king and royal family ; her majesty had been deprived by the English, whom she considered as her allies, but not her masters, of that influence which she had been accustomed to exercise in the government of the country, and altogether excluded from the cabinet councils. For other political reasons of the English government at Palermo, the king, too, had been compelled to resign the government of Sicily into the hands of his eldest son, the crown prince. Still further to prevent the queen from having any influence in future, it was determined that she should be sent out of the island, and, ac cording to her majesty's own story, without having given the English the least reason for so acting, excepting that of continuing to go vern, as she ever had done before she came to the island. To prevent which, she sold, or pledged, every one of her jewels, retired to the mountains, raised a party of peasants with the money she had thus procured, and was re solved therewith to recover her former situation of an independent queen, and not submit to be"], [476, "58 NAPLES. banished by a power which she had called in to protect her against the aggression and the violence, which she had experienced from usurpation in another quarter. I have been assured, that the mountainous situation chosen by her majesty as a place of retreat, had never before been inhabited, ex cept by a few straggling goats. Her forces consisted of about eight or nine hundred men, possessing no weapons of defence, except such as the implements used by them in husbandry would afford ; imitating, in this, the conduct of her immortal mother, Maria Theresa, when driven from her capital by Charles the Seventh, Elector of Bavaria, and flying to the Hunga rians for refuge. Lord William Bentinck soon found that no terms of conciliation would be accepted ; as her majesty declared, that the king's restora tion to power (which was tantamount to that of her own), and the total evacuation of the island of Sicily by the British troops, were the only terms to which, as an independent queen, she would listen. She respected, she said, the English, and considered them as allies ; but never could she be brought to acknowledge them as her masters. In consequence of this declaration, on the part of her majesty, all"], [477, "59 NAPLES. pacific measures were at an end ; and Lord William Bentinck immediately gave orders for the march of a sufficient number of troops, provided with camp equipage and cannon, who completely surrounded her place of refuge ; so that there was no alternative but surrender or starvation. This prompt step induced the queen to spare her followers the inevitable consequences of any momentary resistance, which either her own courage, or their attachment to her cause, might have produced. Her majesty was closely confined in a palace at a short distance from Palermo, and carefully watched by the British troops, to prevent the execution of any further schemes of mischief, with which she might have threatened the island, if suffered to be at liberty. In this condition Caroline continued, until such time as a vessel could be got ready, when she was shipped off to the Ionian Islands; from whence she went to Constantinople, and so on to Austria. In what I have here said, it is not my inten tion to accuse or to defend either party : I am only giving my reader a narrative of facts, to which I happened to be an eye-witness. But, I am free to confess, that, all circumstances considered, Lord William Bentinck, as com-"], [478, "60 NAPLES. mander-in-chief, charged with the safety of the island and also of the British troops, had no other alternative, but to act with that firmness which was most likely to insure the security of both. It was rumoured at Palermo, that previously to Queen Caroline's departure, Lord William recovered her jewels, and sent them to her majesty. Much may be said to exonerate her majesty from the foul charge of having treacherously betrayed either the island, or the British forces who were in it : for it can scarcely be con sidered an act of treason, in independent sove reigns, to endeavour, by any deed of heroism, to recover their lost rights, from those who may have usurped them illegally. The word \" betray\" is, in such cases, as much misapplied, as the word \" rabble\" is, when used towards a body of brave fellows defending themselves against the aggressions of a foreign invader. But argument is of no avail, where force and violence, and not reason or justice, reign paramount ! But, there is even a still stronger ground for exculpating her Neapolitan Majesty from the accusation of treason towards her subjects, her country, and her husband, and of ingrati tude towards the British nation for its active"], [479, "61 NAPLES. protection, which it seems to be difficult for those to imagine, who have not been living all their lives (as I may say) in a sink of vice. It has been my lot twice to have travelled over Eu rope ; and, after witnessing the brilliant glitter ings of all their courts, I can declare, with the utmost truth and solemnity, that by far the most virtuous inmates of those seats of general corruption, have been the sovereigns them selves. I know not whether their faults have been occasioned by the foul effluvia which they hourly inhale from the low and poisonous adu lation of those courtiers, who \" wear their faces to the bent of a king's looks,\" and who \" water their plants with the dews of flattery ;\" but this I will say, that few, very few indeed, are untainted with the infection of mean sub terfuge and hollow deceit : \" Princes, like beauties, from their youth, Are strangers to the voice of Truth. Learn to contemn all praise betimes, For Flattery is the nurse of crimes. Friendship by sweet reproof is shown ; (A virtue never near a throne !) In courts such freedom must offend : There none presume to be a friend !\" The above reflections are not those of a violent aristocrat, or of a vicious and base-minded de-"], [480, "62 NAPLES. mocrat ; but of an honest citizen of the world. Might not the queen's firmness have given umbrage to many of her enemies, from a fear, that if her majesty recovered her right of sovereignty, a just punishment awaited their crimes ? To prevent this, might they not have themselves fabricated all the foul projects attri buted to this most unfortunate queen ? That such things have been done we know but too well ! Witness the conduct of the infamous Madame de la Motte, in return for the well known humanity of that truly amiable, vir tuous, and ever-regretted victim, the Princess of Lamballe, (who interceded in her behalf with Marie Antoinette, and by which intercession the doors of her prison were opened, and the wretch escaped a life of misery to which she had been so justly doomed, as a punishment for her foul calumnies against both these her gene rous benefactors): for until then the public mind had remained untainted by the poisoned shafts which had been scattered in all directions against them. Is not this a fact ? Can it be contradicted ? And if so, might not another such a wretch have been found, who, thinking thereby to kill two birds with one stone, had formed the diabo lical design of accusing the queen of Naples, and"], [481, "63 NAPLES. of bringing down the odium of her party upon Lord William Bentinck for having exiled her ? and of thereby bringing about a revolution, having for its object the destruction of the English troops in Sicily ? \u2014 a project which, though crushed in the cradle, was certainly in agitation. CHAPTER VI. NAPLES.

The Queen had been but a short time sent out of the island of Sicily, when, one morning, the king came unexpectedly to Palermo, and commanded a proclamation to be posted up all over the city, ordering Te Deum to be imme diately performed in all the churches for his"], [482, "64 NAPLES. convalescence, revoking his son's authority, and proclaiming his own resumption of the cares of government. This intention on the part of Ferdinand was announced so suddenly, and had been kept so entirely a secret, that nothing less than the promptitude which Lord William Bentinck had recourse to could have prevented its being realized. To prevent loss of time, the Duke of Orleans v/as instantly made the organ of the British commander-in-chief, to acquaint the king, that his palace at Palermo would forth with be surrounded by the self-same cannon that had sent the queen out of the island, and that he would himself be considered as a pri soner, and be made responsible for all the mis chief which this most imprudent and most un justifiable measure might occasion, if he did not instanter withdraw from the capital to the place from whence he came. Finding that Lord William was not a man to be trifled with, Ferdinand made a virtue of necessity, relinquished the joyful Te Deum, beat a retreat, and chaunted a requiem to his departed authority. His pusillanimity on this occasion lost him the affections of his Sicilian subjects ; as he afterwards lost those ofthe people of Naples, when it became known"], [483, "NAPLES. 65 that he had sanctioned the murder of Carra cioli, of the famous physician Cerillo, of the two Piattis, father and son, and of divers other unfortunate individuals. Was not this a measure calculated to weaken, if not entirely to overthrow, the British in fluence in Sicily, taken by the king himself? Assuredly, his majesty was more culpable than the unfortunate Caroline ; seeing that he had formally and solemnly renounced his authority. Nevertheless he, who had in good truth com mitted himself with respect to the English, was suffered to remain on the island ; because they were then convinced, that though the object was removed, the cause still existed ; and I have often heard many of the common people exclaim \u2014 \" Ebbene, quando saremo liberati di questi nostri ospitti, i signori Inglesi, chi hanno esiliato la nostra regina, poveretta ! e chi ten gono il nostro minchione di re nei ferri per dominare loro ?\" The queen now became an object of com passion with the people of Sicily ; because they found her majesty had not been concerned in imposing on them a foreign yoke, to which they submitted with great reluctance. Like the Neapolitans, when she could no longer render them any assistance, they became sen- VOL. II. f"], [484, "66 NAPLES. sible of their loss ; and the influence of Lady- Hamilton was, in consequence, very much weakened. However, to the kindness of the Queen of Naples, united to her own consummate ad dress, had Lady Hamilton been indebted for her good fortune. The following anecdote, which was related to me by her mother, ac companied with much mirth at the deception so ably played off, has been frequently con firmed by Lady Hamilton herself, as well as part of it by Sir William, and may be depended on as a fact. Miss Emma Codogan \u2014 for that was her name, at least the one which her re puted mother caused her to go by \u2014 when she first came to Naples, was sent by Sir William Hamilton, to be improved in her education, to a convent at Caserta. Walking out one day in the royal gardens, her personal charms attracted considerable notice. They became the subject of general conversation at court ; and, among numerous other dilettanti, they excited the cu riosity of a certain personage, who, as is usual on such occasions, employed some of his dra gomanni to inform him the very next time she made her appearance in the royal gardens. One day, when Emma was taking a walk as usual with the female who had the charge of"], [485, "67 NAPLES. her, she was accosted by the personage in question. He was so completely struck with her \u2014 for she was no less beautiful in form than she was engaging in manners \u2014 that he followed her and solicited a private interview, which was peremptorily refused. He, however, succeeded in gaining over the female belonging to the convent who attended her, to contrive to walk with her in a part of the gardens where they would be less observed ; and he there made her very seducing offers. But she refused to listen to any verbal promises, and requested he would commit to paper the proposition which he had, viva voce, made her. Not in the least suspecting her intentions, the personage in question complied. As soon, however, as Emma was in possession of the desired instrument, she sought an interview with the queen. The opportunity soon pre senting itself, Emma fell upon her knees before her majesty, and humbly implored her, with tears in her eyes, to condescend to hear what she had to communicate. To which the queen consenting, she assured her majesty, that she wished to seclude herself from the world, by taking the veil, provided Sir William Hamil ton did not intend to marry her ; by doing which she said she should escape the seducing f2"], [486, "68 NAPLES. temptations to which she was constantly ex posed. That the queen might judge of the sincerity of her declaration, she artfully pre sented her majesty with the paper given to her by the above-mentioned incognito; for such she represented him to be. At the sight of the document, which she instantly knew to be the king's hand-writing, her majesty was delighted at seeing so young and beautiful a creature so disinterested, and virtuously preferring a life of seclusion to the pleasures of becoming the mistress of a mo narch. Scarcely could Emma refrain from laughing outright, to think how completely she had imposed on her majesty, by making her believe that it was her intention to become a nun ; though the tears were at the moment trickling down her cheeks. Which said tears, however, as she has repeatedly told me, were occasioned by an onion which she had taken the precaution to conceal in her handkerchief, the better to enable her to carry on the farce. The queen had retired a few steps, for the purpose of reading the whole of the letter. \" During which time,\" said Lady Hamilton, \" I was on my marrow-bones in the garden.\" Her majesty then came up to her, and com manding her to rise, assured her, that if Sir"], [487, "69 NAPLES. William Hamilton did not engage to make her his wife, within the space of four and twenty hours, she would provide for her a retreat in a convent, according to her wishes. Taking then a valuable ring from her finger, her ma jesty presented it to the fair supplicant, in re turn for the confidence she had so disinterest edly reposed in her ; and on reaching the palace, she sent immediately for Sir William Hamilton. As might be expected, the result was an im plicit compliance with the wishes of a suppli cating queen, in behalf of his amorosa. It is very probable, that Sir William only wanted a stimulus of this kind, to justify him in putting into execution an act which he had long medi tated, and which he was only deterred from doing, from the fear of forfeiting the high favour which he enjoyed at court, and with it his situation, as well as a dread of the ridicule to which he should be subjected, from the dis parity between the parties, both in point of birth and of years. But, having thus obtained the royal sanction, he got the better of every other scruple ; and, sending for Miss Emma, informed her, in the presence of the queen, that she was now the wife of his choice, and should, without loss of time, be made so by F3"], [488, "70 NAPLES. law. At this sudden and unexpected piece of good fortune the young lady fainted with joy, and was not relieved until a \" sea of copious pearls, which some call tears,\" came to her assistance. From that moment, however, Lady Hamil ton, in consequence of her beauty, her talents, and her good conduct, enjoyed the esteem of every one who was acquainted with her, and became the confidential companion of the Queen of Naples ; and even the old rufpana, as the king used to call the mother of Lady Hamilton, was frequently sent for to make tea for her majesty at the palace. The unfortunate arrival of Admiral Nelson at Naples occasioned a total change in the con duct of Lady Hamilton ; and, in consequence of which change, she lost all her former in fluence and popularity. I left Palermo about the same period at which the queen had been sent off to the Ionian Islands. The last time I had the honour of being presented to her was when her majesty was at Zante. On being ushered into the royal presence, I offered, as usual, to kiss her ma jesty's hand ; which, like those of her unfor tunate sister, Marie- Antoinette, was remarkably handsome. Upon seeing my intention, her"], [489, "71 NAPLES, majesty withdrew it, and said \u2014 \" No, the cere mony would now be a mockery of royalty, and an insult to my present condition. The daugh ter of Maria Theresa \u2014 a wanderer, an outcast \u2014 must no longer receive those marks of dis tinction, which were the prerogatives of the Queen of Naples. You behold me now in a very different situation to that in which you first saw me, when you presented me with the letters of my dear murdered sister.\" At this remark, observing me to be much affected, she continued \u2014 \" Do not imagine I mean to offend you. I know your respectful attentions are directed to my person ; for cer tainly they cannot be interested at this mo ment, as I am no longer in a situation to reward you as such attention merits ; but when I reflect, that the only foreign nation for which I had a sincere regard has thus insulted me, and, what is still worse, ruined me in the esteem of many of my friends, by calumniating me in the eyes of all Europe, I cannot help feeling a pleasure at the sight of one of that nation who, I am sure, will do me justice.\" I said, it was no more than my duty, in grateful return for the former bounties I had received from her majesty ; nay more, it would be an homage paid to her virtues and her fortitude. F4"], [490, "72 NAPLES. \" I thank you,\" continued she ; \" I do not class you among your haughty upstart English, who now govern Sicily. No : I know how to dis tinguish. Sir William Hamilton had been nearly thirty years at Naples. I looked upon him as one of my own family. He was the confidential friend of the king my husband, and all my children loved him. He saw them born. But Lord William Bentinck has been grossly imposed upon : if not, he has insulted me from private motives. I never gave him the least cause for so acting. He lent ready cre dence to every thing that was told him by my enemies. But, it is beneath the dignity of a queen to subject herself to foreign inter ference.\" I said, I always considered Lord William Bentinck to be a most respectable and honour able character, and that probably her majesty had been imposed upon. \" Imposed upon !\" she replied, \" imposed upon ! I have been de prived of the government of my own country \u2014 of the dignity of my character \u2014 of the affec tions of my husband and children ! But he has never been a father \u2014 he has never been a sovereign \u2014 and cannot therefore have the feel ings of insulted majesty. And then, I am ac cused of treason, because, forsooth, I wish to"], [491, "NAPLES. 73 recover my just rights, as an independent sove reign, a wife, and a mother !\" I said, I hoped her majesty would, ere long, enjoy them again. \" Never,\" she replied, \" never. I shall be one of the few queens who end their days in the place that gave them birth. I pardon Lord William, as I do the rest of my enemies ; but not only England, all Europe will one day do me justice.\" I said, I was convinced that her great mind, like that of her immortal mother, would be respected and duly appreciated by posterity. Her majesty next asked me very kindly where I was going? I told her, that as soon as the blockade should be raised, I intended to set off for Venice ; which place was not more than forty-four posts, or eighty-nine German miles, from Vienna. \" Oh,\" said she, \" as you know the miles and posts so well, I conclude you have often been there : to-morrow I am going from hence to Turkey.\" I said, that as soon as I arrived at Venice, I would do myself the honour of inquiring after her majesty's safe arrival, of my friend the Princess Colalto. \" Oh, you know the family of Colalto ? Then I shall see you again.\" I said, that if her majesty would allow me that honour, I should"], [492, "74 NAPLES. consider it as the greatest possible mark of her majesty's distinguished bounty. Giving me her hand, which I was now permitted to kiss \u2014 \" There,\" said she, \" you have it. I shall always be glad to see one who was so earnestly recom mended to me by my beloved sister. I sup pose you are truly English, and not afraid of the sea.\" I said, no ; but that I held with the Italians, when circumstances permitted. \" What is that ?\" I told her majesty they said, \" Lode il mare, ma tiente alia teiTa.\" \u2014 \" Ah,\" said she, \" if ever that should be the policy of England, she will be ruined ; if she be not so already, by her too large standing armies, to the neglect and detriment of her navy.\" I said, I left that matter to those who go verned ; as I did not understand the system of politics at present pursued. \" That shews good sense,\" said her majesty, \" for nobody I believe understands them. From the way in which certain affairs are conducted, it would appear as if their rulers were paid for the ruin, and not the prosperity, of certain countries.\" I said, I hoped her majesty did not think thus of the English ministers. \" I don't know,\" replied she, shrugging up her shoulders: \" they are mere men, like others, and must be blind to"], [493, "75 NAPLES. their own interest, otherwise they would never keep up such standing armies.\" I was extremely happy to see her majesty so calm, and considered myself much honoured by so long a conversation. I therefore encou raged it, for fear of a relapse, and observed, that Sicily, from its situation and commerce, might, I thought, be enabled to keep up a respectable navy. \" Yes,\" replied her majesty, \" if the Sicilians were like the English, and contributed towards the expense ; but all our\" \u2014 Here she immediately corrected herself, say ing \u2014 \" all the Sicilian barons are feudal prin ces, and though sufficiently rich, will not even pay the common taxes, much less contribute towards defraying the expense of a navy. In former times, that good old Sir William Hamil ton, when the war broke out with France, was very desirous that the king, my husband, should establish a naval force, upon the footing of yours in England ; but General Acton insisted, that the King of Naples was too poor to sup port the expense. The times, however, are changed ; and the French, ever since they have had Naples, have made the people pay ten times the taxes they formerly did.\" I then wished her majesty health, and a safe arrival at the place of her destination. She"], [494, "76 NAPLES. graciously wished me the same at Venice, and affectionately reminded me of my promise to visit her at Vienna. CHAPTER VII. NAPLES.

Though her majesty, the Queen of Naples, in the course of the long conversation which I have detailed in the preceding chapter, often delivered herself with much energy, she never for a moment forgot, that she was the daughter of the great Maria Theresa. Her dignified deportment, whilst addressing herself to me without the least restraint, proved her to be every inch a queen ; and I have often been assured by the Duchess Carigliana Marini, who followed her majesty to Sicily when she left Naples, that the only motive she had for cultivating the acquaintance of Lady Hamilton and her mother was, that they were her spies"], [495, "NAPLES. 77 Upon the king's private amours, and upon the motions of that portion of the nobles who were disaffected towards her authority ; and who, to maintain their influence, stirred up great mis chief at Naples, involving the ruin of the queen and that of many other families. I forgot to mention in its proper place, that in the course of the preceding conversation, her majesty introduced the name of Salicetti, saying, in Italian, \" Anche quel birbante ha creduto di prendermi in trapola : what could I expect from a villain, who had been the fac totum of the whole revolutionary tribe, and who was then one of the most active satellites of Bo noparte and of Murat at Naples? But, I will say no more : the wretch was beneath my notice. Yet, I am accused by Lord William of having carried on a correspondence with Murat, the object of which correspondence was to betray the English ! After seeing our most faithful servants and friends torn from the king, and myself insulted, what would he have done, had he been in my situation ? God forgive him ! I never had reason to regret my knowledge of any other British subject. Lord William has been strongly prejudiced against me. How ever, it will soon be out of the power of my"], [496, "78 NAPLES. enemies to do me any injury, or further to mortify my amour propre.\" These observations were delivered with that stoic firmness which is seldom the companion of a guilty mind. Grand and dignified in her demeanour \u2014 of a disposition liberal and muni ficent \u2014 noble of stature, and the mother of a numerous and healthy family \u2014 Caroline of Naples, though a fallen sovereign, was still powerful over her own wounded feelings, be cause endowed with real fortitude and genuine virtue. I had first the honour of being introduced to her Sicilian Majesty in the year 1791, when I was intrusted with* letters to her from her sister, Marie- Antoinette, the Queen of France ; by whose gracious recommendation I was often charged with verbal messages, of a nature too delicate to be committed to paper in those perilous times, when the most trifling miscon struction might have occasioned the death of the innocent bearer of them. In the year 1793, in the fatal month of Oc tober, in which that injured queen was so bar barously murdered at Paris by the revolu tionary cannibals, I went to Florence ; but, being in a very indifferent state of health, I was per-"], [497, "NAPLES. 79 suaded by Lord Hervey, Mr. Udney, and many other friends, to try the effect of a change of air, since they were aware that my illness had been occasioned by my being overwhelmed with grief, for the losses I had sustained on the fatal tenth of August, and the barbarity exercised on the third of September towards my most liberal benefactress. The recommen dation was followed ; and, in company with two foreign ladies, I set off for Naples. Sir William and Lady Hamilton having been ap prized of my intention, and feeling much in terested in my welfare, kindly came to meet their former friend some mdes on the road to Naples ; but, no sooner did I see that they were both in deep mourning, than I was at once convinced that the Queen of France was, alas, no more ! Sir William Hamilton was the only person admitted to the presence of the Queen of Naples, while the mock trial of her martyred sister was going on at Paris. On Sir William's announcing my arrival, amongst other persons who had come to Naples to pay their respect ful homage of condolence for her majesty's grievous affliction, he received her imme diate command to present me exclusively to her."], [498, "80 NAPLES. On entering the royal apartment, and be holding her majesty, who bore so strong a resemblance to her murdered sister, I fell speechless into the arms of Sir William ; when the Queen of Naples exclaimed, with a tre mendous shriek, \" Good God ! did you ever think the French would have treated my dear sister and her husband in so horrible a way ?\" This scene, though heart-rending, was pro pitious, as it afforded me time to recover. I was, in a feeble voice, about to address her majesty in French, when she instantly said, \" for God's sake, do not, I beseech you, let me hear any of that murderous language ! You speak German and Italian ; pray address me, for the future, in either of those languages.\" However, her majesty soon relapsed, and con tinued the conversation in French, which seemed her habitual language. I saw her majesty again in the year 1795, and might also have seen her when she was at Palermo ; but, from the situation the country was likely soon to be in, and she being then under a certain surveillance, I was told by high authority, that it would be most prudent in me not to visit her majesty, nor send the letter I had brought with me: which was merely a letter of recommendation from one of the Im-"], [499, "81 NAPLES. perial Family, for the purpose of refreshing her memory. For which, however, there was no necessity ; for though many years had elapsed, the moment my name was made known to her majesty at Zante, she instantly recollected it, and began to unburthen her mind to me in the manner I have already related. And even then she recalled to my remembrance the most re markable events ofthe French Revolution which so cruelly interested her ; particularly those of the tenth of August and third of September 1792, and the fourteenth of October 1793; the last of which always brought torrents of tears into her eyes, which never failed to be followed by a volley of execrations against the whole French nation. This, I think, ought, in no small degree, to exonerate her majesty from the suspicion of partiality to a nation, which she always con sidered as the cause of the ruin and overthrow osso many members of her august family, and by which she herself had been driven to seek refuge under the military protection of ano ther nation, which now rewarded her confi dence with banishment. The school of adver sity may tend to soften down the violence of passion, but it can never change or destroy the workings of nature. vol. 11. g"], [500, "82 NAPLES. Shortly after his marriage with Caroline of Austria, the King of Naples was one day walk ing out with his youthful bride at Caserta. On their way, they were accosted by a peasant, whose wife had blessed him with three thump ing boys at a birth. The poor fellow observed, that he should have been more pleased if they had been three calves. \" And how did you manage the matter,\" said the king, \" for I have been married for some time and have not had a child yet?\" \" Please your majesty,\" replied the man, \" the jade deceived me ; for I have only been married three months, and therefore two-thirds of the business must have been done before hand.\" \" O, then,\" said the king, \" in that case you only come in for a third of the merit !\" \" Yes,\" continued the clown, \" that is true ; but I should neverthe less like to find out to whom the other two belong, for I am very poor, and dame is so ill, that she has lost her milk and cannot suckle the brats.\" \" Well, here's something to buy a cow with, and I hope she will turn out more profit able to you than your wife has done.\" \" Bless your majesty, there's no such luck among the brute creation ; for no other animal is so prolific as a woman 1\""], [501, "83 NAPLES. The queen laughed heartily at this dialogue between a king and a clown. However, though her majesty was not of the Neapolitan breed, which is considered the most fruitful in all Italy, she nevertheless verified the peasant's remark, and, in the course of a few years, became the mother of twelve or fourteen fine children. The Neapolitans are robust, well made, above the middle stature, and rarely deformed or de fective in their features. The females have little to recommend them but their eyes, and are very much inclined per far I'amore. In general, they are sallow complexioned, much given to indolence, badly educated, uncouth in their manners, but enthusiastically attached to their own country : \" Vedi Napoli, e poi mori,\" is their standing proverb. The common conversation of the Neapoli tans is generally so noisy and so boisterous, that a stranger would naturally suppose they were on the point of murdering one another. Their gesticulation is very significant; but they are the most laconic nation on earth. In affairs of business they will impose upon you if they can. Even the most respectable shop keepers will ask you three times more for an article than it is worth ;* and on being told of g 2"], [502, "84 NAPLES. it, they will rarely let the article be re-shewn : they generally answer you in monosyllables, and, after taking the goods from the counter, will say, \" vatene, va.\" When asked to direct a stranger to any par- ticular spot, they stare him full in the face, and lift up their heads towards the sky ; which is as much as to say, \" I don't know.\" Or if they happen to like your countenance, after taking a survey of it, they will answer you roughly, \" chi saggio ?\" A lady who was about to pay a morning visit to a friend, knocked at an apartment on the ground floor, where she thought she lived : on opening it, the servant lifted up his head and shut the door in her face. Supposing that her friend lived above, she as- cended a story higher, where she met with the same reception. Upon this, concluding that her friend, who was of a studious turn of mind, had taken an upper floor, to avoid the terrible rattle of the strada Toledo, she continued her pursuit, until she had reached the uppermost apartment, where she was again answered by the same inclination of the head, and the same chi saggio ? I may here observe, that it is quite common, in various parts of Italy, for persons of the first rank to live in the upper stories of their man-"], [503, "85 NAPLES. sions, in preference to the lower, particularly at Genoa and Venice, where they give sumptuous entertainments in them to their firiends and relatives. There is little or no difference in the man ners of the lazzaroni of Naples and the an cient nobility ; except such of them as have travelled. Intelligence and classical know ledge is alone to be met with in the middling ranks of society ; yet they boast of many lite rary men, whose works have immortalized their names, and stood the test of ages. The Nea politans are, however, by nature, classically musical. In the beginning of the French revolution, Saint Januarius, who was the patron of Naples, being accused of the crime of Jacobinism, his statue was brought into open court, tried, found guilty, condemned to lose all its valuable orna ments, to be thrown into prison, and Januarius to be deprived of his protectorship ; which was transferred to Saint Anthony. In such extra vagant veneration had the worthy Januarius, their old patron, once been held, that the ignorant people would implore our Saviour to solicit that saint to be propitious to them \u2014 ima gining the latter to have more influence than the former ! g 3"], [504, "86 NAPLES. At Naples were formerly to be found a larger number of a certain class of mutilated beings, of which I have spoken in my first volume, than in any other city of Italy. These poor devils are sensible of their degraded condition, and generally give out, that it has being owing to accident. In general, however, they are the offspring of the lowest class of the human spe cies, who sacrifice their children to the vilest speculation. Hundreds of them have been thus shamefully unsexed in their infancy, who never possessed a voice ; as the operation would be of too dangerous a nature at a more ad vanced stage of their existence. It is no less true than extraordinary, that if the excision takes place during bad weather, the victims never sing in tune. This is certainly very curious ! When they happen to have no voices, they are either taught to play on some instru ment, or are otherwise employed in menial situations, as they are totally ignorant of every thing but music ; for the moment they are docked for singing, they are sent to the conser vatoires. Scarcely a soul of them can read. Pacchierotti was one of the best informed of the race of castrati. In consequence of his having a large portion of natural good sense, he greatly improved himself by study. Mar-"], [505, "87 NAPLES. chesi was so grossly ignorant, that he wrote the word opera, opperra ; but nature had been so bountiful to this animal, that his ignorance and insolence were forgotten the moment he sang. I have frequently been in company with Paisiello and the famous Monk, il padre Gior dano, at Sir William Hamilton's. This Monk had a remarkably fine bass voice, and though an eminent preacher, would often accompany Lady Hamilton in comic and double entendre duets, catches, and glees, in which Paisiello and Mrs. Billington would join. In consequence of meeting the above Monk so much in society, I remember the King of Naples once saying, that he was the best preacher, the best singer, and the best eater of maccaroni in his whole dominions. He was a very stout man, above six feet high, well proportioned, and had a good-looking, cheerful countenance. His long, white, monastic dress, contrasted with that of the rest of the com pany, had the most singular effect possible ; considering that monastic characters in general ought to be dead to worldly pleasures, and alive only to the edification and improvement of others. Father Giordano was not, however, to be classed among his dead brethren ; for he really lived, and enjoyed the good things of this g 4"], [506, "88 NAPLES. world like other men, and was, to all intents and purposes, what may be called a bon vivant. Paisiello having completed a new oratorio, at the first representation of which the king, the queen, and all the court were present, the composer came to conduct Lady Hamilton and myself to the church, which was very much crowded. As dilettanti, we were placed by the composer in a situation the best calculated for us to appreciate its merits. It was really a good composition. It was certainly not in the sublime style of the immortal Handel's sacred music ; nevertheless, had it been as well exe- cuted as the music of the latter generally is in England, the effect would have been very dif- ferent. On this occasion, there happened to be no fewer than a hundred of those \" noun adjectives of the neuter gender,\" of which I have been speaking, employed in the cho- russes ; and, so abominably did they sing out of tune, that poor Paisiello, forgetting where he was, jumped from his seat in a passion, and exclaimed, \" Ah ! managgio dei morti, siete stati tutti castrati in cativo tempo !\" alluding to the fact I have already noticed ; namely, that these degraded beings never sing in tune, when the maiming operation has taken place in bad weather. The effect can be better imagined than"], [507, "89 NAPLES. described : the church resounded with the laughter of the whole congregation ; and thus ended the poor \" enraged musician's\" oratorio ! Though Paisiello, as well as his brother com poser Cimarosa, had all the manners of the lazzaroni, he nevertheless would not have so far forgotten the respect due to the sacred place in which he then was, had he not been entirely led away by his mortified feelings. Cimarosa and Paisiello were sworn enemies. They were never seen in company with each other. It was impossible to be on friendly terms with the one, if you happened to applaud the works of the other. These two great men in their line, would even go to the theatre in disguise, to hiss each other's compositions. But Cimarosa was superior to Paisiello. Gene rally speaking, one opera of the former compo ser would have made a dozen operas of the lat ter. They were, however, much esteemed at Naples ; and deservedly considered \u2014 Arcades ambo ; Et cantare pares, et respondere parati.\" Skilful Arcadians both, and both inspir'd To sing, and answer as the song requir'd.\""], [508, "90 CHAPTER VIII.

The Roman code of laws at present in use \u2014 for that of the immortal Justinian has long been banished the country for which it was intended \u2014 is founded on caprice, and is one, in the execution of which justice is sacrificed to power. In point of theory, the prohibition of litigation between brother and brother, ap pears well calculated to preserve harmony be tween two beings springing from the same pa rent stock : but, how far it may be beneficial in practice, I leave to the gentlemen wearing black robes and big powdered wigs to decide ;"], [510, "92 ROME and shall only observe, that if such a law exist ed in England, bread would be considerably cheaper; as much of the flour which is now wasted on wig blocks, would find its way into the bellies of the half-starved and the hungry. But \u2014 as there is always a wheel within a wheel \u2014 for the purpose of doing away with the effects of this law, an act of absolution may be pro cured, on the payment of about three hundred Roman crowns to the dateria, not only con firming the power of fraternal litigation, but granting a salva guardia to litigate even against the twelve Apostles, if they said twelve apostles were again to come upon the earth. The members forming the tribunals at Rome, if tribunals they can be designated, are called Auditors. Those who fill the office of Audi- tors of the sacred Rota have peculiar privileges over the rest of the Auditors ; who, though they sit as judges, are, from their numerous acts of cruelty and injustice, more criminal than the malefactors who are executed before the debtors' door of Newgate. Their mode of pro- ceeding in all civil cases, both as judge and as jury (for both characters are united in one and the same person), is this : whenever a creditor who happens to be a stranger, makes his appeal against a Roman subject, to avoid entering into"], [511, "93 ROME the merits of the case, the applicant is put off whenever he seeks justice, with the cant word of ' proservato ; and a decision is never come to, one way or the other ; it being their policy to retain foreigners as long as possible at Rome, whereby the city derives a benefit, which . it would not do were the judges to come to a prompt decision. Thus do the cases remain in their primitive state, in secula seculorum ; which is even worse than what we see in an English Court of Chancery ; for there it is not impossi ble, that the third or fourth generation may come triumphantly out of court with the family deeds \u2014 though the property shall long ago have been entirely swallowed up by the legal expenses ! Thanks, however, to the senatorial exertions of Mr. John Williams, the vigorous little bantam-cock of the British bar, that most grievous of nuisances, the \"law's delay,\" stands a fair chance of being speedily \" abated.\" I wish I could say the same thing of \" The insolence of office, and the spurns, Which patient merit of the unworthy takes.\" Though the Roman States have suffered much in their legitimate population from the effects of external celibacy, in consequence of which two thirds ofthe land is uncultivated, and even the"], [512, "94 ROME one-third which is cultivated is generally per formed by peasants coming from Tuscany or the northern states of Italy, the devil is never theless as busily employed in this holy city, as ever he was in the garden of Eden ; and, in the article of \" forbidden fruit\" he has been, and now is, carrying on as brisk a trade, as in any other part of the known world. For there is no class of men who have more nephews and nieces than the Roman clergy, and especially the Cardinals. Having no chddren whom they dare to own, they differ from all other men, in living after death, by the adoption of those of other people. Since the unnatural Councd of Trent, no ecclesiastic is suffered to have a child of his own : he al ways contrives, however, to have some good natured brothers or cousins, who are ready to father them. The natives of Rome partake generally of the spirit and character peculiar to its soil, whenever it is cultivated. They are the best improvisatori and satirists in all Europe. The genuine Roman masculine character is more faithfully depicted in the class called the Tras teverini, than it is in those who reside on this side the Tiber. Though the violence of in quisitorial superstition may have tended to"], [513, "95 ROME debilitate their manly character, and to disin cline them to warlike exertions, it has never been able to subdue their independent spirit, or entirely to repress their mental energies. When a paper currency was about to be in troduced into the Roman States, a certain indi dual at Rome published some very judicious remarks, pointing out the drawback it would occasion to commercial speculations, and the evils which it had already inflicted in France, in Germany, and in Spain. To obviate which evds, he intimated, that it would be necessary, as a previous step, that the government should declare the precise quantity it intended to put into circulation, which should be secured to the holder on lands legally mortgaged for the liquidation of the sums necessary to replace the said paper ; by which means it would always be at par with the precious metals. At this just proposition the government took the alarm, fearing that the publication might tend to impede the operation of the measure ; as it was also suggested, that in the mortgage given to the national creditor should be speci fied, whether it was to be repaid in revenue, in landed property, or in specie. A reward of six thousand crowns was offered for the dis covery of the person or persons who had thus"], [514, "96 ROME dared to prejudice the operations of govern ment. On the following morning, the statue of Marforio was wittily made to ask the statue of Pasquin, \" whether the reward was to be paid in paper or in specie ?\" Nor did the go vernment ever discover the author of the pam phlet, or of the pasquinade. Perhaps I ought to tell my reader, that the statue of Marforio is a statue of Mars, found in the forum, which the people have corrupted into Marforio. The statue of Pasquin is a mar- ble statue, greatly mutilated, which stands at the corner of the palace of the Ursini. It takes its name from a cobbler of that city, called Pasquin, famous for his sneers and gibes, and who diverted himself by passing his jokes on all that went through that street. After his death, as they were digging up the pave- ment before his door, they found in the earth the statue of an ancient gladiator, well cut, but maimed and half spoiled : this they set up in the place where it was found, and, by common consent, named it Pasquin. Since that time, all satires are attributed to that figure ; and are either put into its mouth, or pasted upon it ; and these are addressed by Pasquin to Mar forio. When Marforio is attacked Pasquin de fends him ; and when Pasquin is attacked Mar-"], [515, "97 ROME forio assists him in his turn ; that is, the people make the statues speak just what they please. Rome seems to be the very element for the growth of the fine arts. Whether it be owing to the recollection of her having been, for ages, the seat of the chef-d' \u0153uvres of the immortal authors of those sublime monuments, or to the climate, or to the beautiful view of the seven hills, certain it is, that those chef-d' \u0153uvres are no where so duly appreciated as at Rome. The grandeur of their buildings, the magnifi cence of their churches, daily presenting them selves to the eyes ofthe inhabitants, have justly made them the envy of every civilized nation. The immortal Canova, when at Vienna, and in the zenith of his celebrity, courted and feted by all that was distinguished for birth, for rank, and for talent, being one day at Prince Rezzonico's, was asked, why he appeared so low-spirited? \" I do not know,\" said he, \" what is the reason ; but, when I am in my studio at Rome, working all day long with my paper cap on my head and my apron round my waist, I feel my lungs expand, my heart at ease, my spirits light as air, and my vigour increased by contemplating the surrounding objects.

But, fifteen millions of people should not be condemned on account of the vices of their different go vernments, whose policy it has uniformly been to keep them in a state of division, whereby every virtue arising from the amor patri\u0153 has been enfeebled, and rendered nugatory. How just is the sentiment of Sallust ! \" Concordia res parv\u00e6 crescunt, discordia. maxima? ddabuntur.\" Would to Heaven, that the several nations of Italy had in time read, learned, and in wardly digested Fontaine's delightful fable, beginning, \" Toute puissance est foible, a moins que d'etre unie !\" The people of Ferrara, Urbino, Ancona, and Bologna, as well as the Trasteverini, have long evinced an ardent love of liberty and in dependence ; and, if seconded in their efforts h 2"], [518, "100 ROME by a generous nation, may one day effect the desired emancipation of all Italy.

What an immense debt of gratitude do the people of Europe owe to those wonderful works which abound in every part of this truly classical country ; which few have succeeded in equalling, and none in surpassing ; and which have had such a decided influence on the taste of all other nations ! Though in no city can improvement be so effectually obtained as at Rome, yet the mo tive which once animated, and inspired, and called into action, the genius of her own chil dren, alas, lies crushed and buried under the dark superstition of narrow-minded ecclesias tical dominion ! I say, \" narrow-minded ;\" be cause, there was a time, when the head of the church was the life and the soul of the fine arts.

Whenever any one of the understrappers of his holiness the Pope happens to become a favourite with the people, he is generally ap pointed Governor of Rome ; that being a sure step to the dignity ofthe Cardinalate. During the time that Pius the Seventh was at Paris, engaged in the holy office of anointing Buonaparte and his wife Josephine, and crown ing them Emperor and Empress of France, the Governor of Rome was a person named Caval chini; but, from his ignorance and vulgarity"], [521, "HOME 103 the appellation of Cavallaccio would have bet ter suited him. This same Cavalchini could never be spoken with after dinner; so, in order to save trou ble, he would generally, like the worthy Hiber nian, breakfast over night ; for this disgusting creature, from the copious libations which he paid to Bacchus \u2014 the only debts, by the bye, he ever troubled himself about paying \u2014 would sometimes continue in the holy state of com fortable intoxication for eight and forty hours together, and sometimes longer ; pursuits of this kind being better suited to his reverend governorship than the dry routine of public business. Previously to the mighty Napoleon making his infant son and heir king of Rome, the streets of that city were never suffered to be lighted up. To prevent the people from running foul of each other, or against the carriages of the car dinals, every one provided himself with a dark lantern, simdar to those which are made use of by house-breakers in this country ; which lan terns they would poke into people's faces, and thereby prevent them from seeing their way. This state of darkness, in which it was the policy of the Roman government to keep its subjects, was resorted to, upon the principle, h 4"], [522, "104 ROM E that it was as well for the people to be kept ignorant of certain cardinal practices ; which would become too manifest and glaring, if the streets were suffered to be lighted up. For the self-same reason the holy conclave have a private door to all the theatres in Rome, through which they enter en masque, and every now and then, par hasard, stumble in the dark, upon some pretty female or two ; whom, out of pure christian charity, of course, they take under tbe shelter of their sacred wings, during Carnival time ; the better to prepare the said pretty females for their Lent confessions ! All these aforesaid matters are carried on at Rome, in a mightily edifying, pious, and inno cent sort of way, and purely for the good of the souls of the parties concerned ! as may naturally be expected, from men who are living under so sober a governor, and whose long cloaks so philanthropically cover what the witty Sheridan, in his admirable opera of the Duenna, calls \" provision for the convent.\" Nay, such a sympathetic feeling \u2014 so vast a spirit of christian charity \u2014 presides in its pristine vi gour in the breasts of\" these celibatarii, that the moment a free trader happens to arrive in the holy city, the fact is made known from one end of it to the other ; and, if the frail fair one"], [523, "105 ROME. should not be inclined to accommodate the whole college of cardinals, it is hinted to her, that she must forthwith shift her quarters, and carry on her carnal concerns elsewhere. The greater part of the Roman nobility scarcely ever give wages to their domestics. Indeed, it was customary formerly for servants to allow their masters a certain sum, out ofthe money they extorted from those foreigners, who merely visited Rome, for the sake of viewing the chef-d' \u0153uvres of the fine arts, in the pos session of the nobility. Prince Spada is the proprietor of what is said to be the original statue of Pompey the Great, at whose base the mighty C\u00e6sar was so cruelly murdered. It is not shown to strangers at less than five paoli a head ; and, as John Bull has not so much ready cash in his pocket as he formerly had, and is therefore become wiser, when the English set about visiting these valuable collections, they go in plural groups, paying only the singular price ; a practice which has greatly diminished the gains of these ciceroni : but the established price for seeing any of the rarities which abound at Rome is three paoli. If a foreigner pays a visit to a Roman noble man, he is sure to receive, the next morning, the congratulations on his safe arrival of all the"], [524, "106 ROME domestics of the family ; and there is no mis taking the matter for mere civilized hospitality, for their very countenances discover that they have an eye to your pocket, and come with the design of playing upon your generosity. It is not uncommon for them to tell foreigners point blank, that they live upon what they can collect from strangers, as their masters allow them no stated salary. Indeed, their own excellent proverb contains the best definition of this degraded race \u2014 \" Rcma santa, e popolo corrotto ;\" and, as long as this fine portion of Italy shall continue under the trammels of an ecclesiastical government, it never can recover itself, so far as to be on a level with the other civflized nations of Italy ; and stdl less wdl its people aim at an imitation of the dignity, the valour, the virtue, and the greatness of their renowned forefathers. From her primitive ecclesiastical institutions, Rome has naturally been deprived of those things, which are allowed to form the best riches of every other country \u2014 population, agri culture, and commerce. Solely as head of the Church, and as the sovereign representative of St. Peter, surely the Pope might be to the fuU as much respected as he now is. \" My kingdom is not of this world,\" was the Ian-"], [525, "107 ROME, guage of our Saviour. God forbid that I should wish to deprive his holiness of his just prerogatives ! I cannot, however, help think ing, that if he were to confine himself solely to spiritual concerns, it would be much to the advantage of the Christian world; and that his presence would become the foot of the altar, infinitely better than it does the arena of political warfare. The restoration of the holy father to tempo ral power, has certainly been owing more to English policy, than to the exertions of all the catholic princes of Europe; as those princes, both individually and in a body, voted against it. Nay, the Emperor of Austria, when the late Pope was elected at Venice, would not, but for the influence of Napoleon, have con sented to his returning to Rome to take pos session of the Sacred See. But the holy father was at that time one of the innumerable gew gaws with which the great Buonaparte amused himself, and the people he governed ; and, hav ing so powerfully seconded him in his projects, the newly-made emperor insisted on his pope ship being allowed to leave Venice. On which account, when he reached Rome, he acquired the nickname of Papa-Gallo. To such a pitch did the crafty Corsican hoax the holy man, that"], [526, "108 ROME he made him believe he was a staunch Catholic. But, though he acknowledged the Pope's su premacy, as head of the church, he insisted on his being allowed to go to Rome, merely for the purpose of humbling the pride of Austria, and to make the old pope himself subservient to his future views of aggrandize ment : for he was well aware, that it was much easier to subdue the ecclesiastical autho rity, than it would be that of any other prince, whom Austria, or the allied powers, might be inclined to set up in his stead ; feeling perfectly persuaded, that they did not intend to unite it to the kingdom of Naples. England also, from political motives, the more effectually to baffle the powers of the continent, became the strenuous advocate for the re-integration of the papal authority : at the very moment, too, when throughout the British dominions, all relaxation in favour of her own catholic subjects was denied to them ; though no crime could be charged against them \u2014 unless it be one to adhere faithfully to the religion of one's forefathers ! I do not mean to justify the horrid rebellions, the plun derings, and the murders, of a portion ofthe mis guided catholics of Ireland ; but, surely there must be some physical as well as political"], [527, "109 ROME causes for effects so direful in their conse quences ! While the pope was absent on his famous visit at Paris, it was held, by Cavalchini, the governor of Rome, to be tantamount to high treason for any one to suspect, insinuate, or even imagine, that his holiness would return to his capital empty handed. The restitution of the Roman legations which had been taken from Pius the Sixth at the peace of Tolentino, was looked upon as the intended reward of his ready compliance. To secure this restitution, the pope fancied himself justified in acceding to the humiliating journey, which Buonaparte compelled him to undertake, as well as to the still more disgraceful task of officiating at his coronation at Paris. There can be no doubt whatever, that Buonaparte had held out similar allurements, and that they had been confirmed to the Pope by Melzi, Duke of Lodi, as well as by General Miolis. However, when he had succeeded in getting the Roman \" actors,\" as he called them, to figure away on the French stage, and had there exposed and turned into ridicule the whole Roman catholic hierarchy, Napoleon thought no more of his promises. Though it must be confessed, that the appearance at Paris of his"], [528, "110 ROME holiness, added much to the solemnity of the ceremony, and gave real weight to the asser tion, that Buonaparte had been called to the imperial diadem of France by the free will of the people ; yet, as head of the catholic church, it cannot be denied, that the pope, by his pre sence, sacrilegiously sanctioned the exclusion ofthe crown from the head of its then existing ligitimate wearer, in order to place it on that of an unprincipled usurper. This imprudent as well as unjust act, in the face of all Europe, on the part of the power that ought to have been the most opposed to its execution, furnished Napoleon with the arms wherewith he had predetermined speedily to subdue the pope and the whole ecclesiastical domination, by lessening and degrading the very foundation of the religious order. And this he certainly effected, by being Macchia velist enough to cause himself to be crowned at Paris by the sacred pontiff: this being the only instance of the kind in the history of the christian church ; for even Charlemagne, who, in the year 800, had surrendered the Roman states in perpetuity to the ecclesiastical au thority, had condescended to repair to Rome, for the purpose of being crowned. What an amazing improvement has the lapse of a thou-"], [529, "111 ROME sand years effected in the manners and senti ments of mighty conquerors ! As soon as the farce of the coronation was over, his holiness the pope, accompanied by his pontifical suite, paid a visit to the Tuille ries, to congratulate his Imperial Majesty on the event, and took occasion to jog the me mory of the mighty man, as to the promise he had entered into, with regard to the restitution of the Roman legations. Upon this the \" po tentissimo ed augustissimo imperatore,\" \u2014 for such were the titles which he had modestly taken to himself \u2014 flew into one of his violent passions, \u2014 exclaimed, with his brother monarch, the renowned Arthur, We were indeed a pretty king of clouts, Were we to truckle to her maudlin humours ;\" and ordered the hoary-headed manager, to gether with his troop of puppets, to quit the capital of his empire, without loss of time \u2014 but not before he had made the old man feel the weight of his imperial fist !

Certain it is, that Napoleon and the Pope parted in mutual disgust and dudgeon with each other : so much so, indeed, that the for mer would not allow his holiness to crown him King of Italy. The promise respecting the restitution of the legations was a mere pre tence for getting the Pope to Paris ; and, as it was never intended to be performed, it was as good as any other : to have answered the ob ject of the moment, Buonaparte would not merely have promised the legations, but all France itself: his language resembled that of the renowned Macheath \u2014 \" What signifies a promise to a female !\" When he had no further occasion for Pius the Seventh, it is clear that he regarded him in the light of an old woman : and therefore was it necessary that the good man should be disgraced, as an VOL H.

Another thing that gave mortal offence to the newly-made Emperor was, that his holi ness was daily becoming more and more popu lar at Paris ; a circumstance this, which was of itself a deadly sin in the eves of the master of Europe. The bare idea that any earthly being should share in his popularity, was as a dagger to his heart. The Parisians, too, even began to be religious : they anxiously attend ed his h oliness's benedictions ; they applauded him in public, more loudly than they did their new monarch : and these were mortal crimes not easily to be forgiven. The refusal to fulfil his promise, by restoring the provinces taken from Pius the Sixth at Tolentino, compelled his holiness to quit Paris and the new im perial court ; after remonstrating against the shameful treatment he had received at the hands of Napoleon, and solemnly protesting against the violence that had been offered to his sacred person. Every thing between his holiness the Pope and the Emperor Napoleon remained in statu quo, until his last invasion of Austria ; upon which occasion, the principal condition on which"], [533, "ROME 115 he consented to withdraw his troops from Vienna, was a contract for a young wife, before he had fairly got rid of an old one. Having entered into this stipulation with the sovereign of Austria, the father of Maria Louisa, Napoleon next insisted, that his intended daddy-in-law should henceforward go by the name of Fran cis the First. \" Necessitas non habet legem :\" as drowning men are said to catch at straws, the Emperor, for the sake of saving himself, sacrificed his beloved daughter, and assumed the proffered title. To satisfy his sensual inclination, Napoleon, like Henry the Eighth of England, applied for the salva condotta to his holiness the Pope ; and, as Henry thought it would not be more difficult to obtain a divorce than it had been to assume the title of Defender of the Faith ; so was Napoleon equally credulous in believing, that the consent to a divorce could be as easdy obtained from the Pope, as the consent to a coronation had been. The title of \" defender of the faith\" had been bestowed on Henry by Leo the Tenth, for the support which the Eng lish monarch had given to the Catholic reli gion ; but the divorce was applied for to Cle ment the Seventh, the new pope, who was then the prisoner of Charles the Fifth, a near rela- i 2"], [534, "116 R O M E tive to Catherine of Arragon ; who, from po litical motives, as well as on principles of re ligion, refused his compliance. As Napoleon had not only violently insulted tlie head ofthe church, but had trampled religion under his feet, the Pope had every reason to be dissatisfied with his conduct ; and feeling him self, besides, under no obligation to the Em peror of Austria, he was induced by no mo tives of policy to act in contradiction to the dictates of his own conscience ; for he had re-married Buonaparte to Josephine at the ex press desire of the husband ; as previously they had only been bound together by a civil contract, during the reign of democratic principles, and had not submitted to the ecclesiastical cere- mony, by which Catholic marriages can never be dissolved, except on proof that they did not take place according to the precise forms enjoined by that religion. This, however, could not be the case in the instance before us, as the ceremony, which had taken place only a few years before, was not one between minors, or between individuals living under the controul of parental violence, but between two persons arrived at the full age of maturity, and following their own sponta neous inclinations."], [535, "ROME. 117 Even if his holiness had been living on the best terms with Napoleon, obstacles here present ed themselves, which could not be got rid of, except in the case of an hereditary legitimate line, where a succession was necessary ; as in the instance of Henry the Fourth of France, who repudiated Ann of Vaiois, and married Catherine of Medicis. But Buonaparte had long before this publicly declared the first-born son of his brother Louis to be his heir ; and, previously to that, the son of Josephine, prince Eugene Beauharnois. All these obstacles were, however, mere trifles with a man like Buonaparte, who had made up his mind further to ennoble himself by an Austrian alliance : that alliance which proved so fatal to himself, to France, and to all Europe ! for in wedding Maria Louisa, he united himself to his malora ; and, in propor tion as his grandeur increased, so did his popu larity decline. By this single act, the strings of his good fortune were snapped asunder. He now shone, in the constellation of royalty, like one of those minor planets which revolve round tjhe sun, and borrow their light from the great orb of day. Every mean insult was now resorted to, whereby the authority of the Pope could be 1 3"], [536, "118 ROME. in any way undermined ; and, assassin like, the poisonous shafts were aimed at his holiness in the dark. His subjects were encouraged and incited to rebellion, by promises of reward ; and his sacred authority was spurned at and disregarded. To all which the good man, saint like, submitted, with a degree of resig nation only to be looked for in truly Christian minds. His territories were violated ; his go vernment was overthrown ; and he himself was made a prisoner in his own capital. In this state of suffering, Napoleon naturally expected, on the part of Pius the Seventh, either complaint or compliance. But, neither one nor the other could he extort from the calm and philosophical ministers of his holiness. Outrageous at this unexpected forbearance, Napoleon directed Miolis, who then command ed the French forces at Rome, to arrest the Pope, in the Quirinal palace, and to send him forthwith a prisoner to France. Miolis, who was an ex-friar, had hitherto shewn the greatest outward marks of respect towards the person of his holiness. The Pope, however, forseeing, from the violent measures that had been adopt ed, that Napoleon would not be satisfied, until such an event had taken place, had determined to shut himself up in his palace, and to exclude"], [537, "119 ROME himself from visitors, of all descriptions, except ing his own trustworthy ministers. Upon this, Miolis made frequent remon strances to Cardinal Consalvi, at his being thus deprived of all intercourse with his holiness ; and, receiving the uniform answer, that the Pope would be seen by no one, he, \" in the dead waste and middle of the night\" \u2014 an hour propitious to deeds of treachery \u2014 taking with him a body of soldiers, scaled the wads of the Quirinal palace, entered the garden like a** thief, broke open the door of the chamber in which his holiness was sleeping, arrested him, and sent him off, that very night, like a common malefactor, with scarcely any one to attend him, or any supply of the things neces sary to his personal use and comfort. So se cretly was the affair conducted, and so little was it then expected to be executed, that nearly all the conclave were absent at their country residences ; and it was not known in Rome, until late on the following day, that their sovereign had been kidnapped and carried off to France. The better to prevent discovery, Miolis had caused relays of horses to be placed at dif ferent stations, at a distance from the high road, by which his scandalous treachery re* i 4"], [538, "120 ROME mained undiscovered. This atrocious cir- cumstance calls to my recollection the arrest of the whole royal family of Spain, at the period when Buonaparte offered himself as a mediator between the king and his son the Crown Prince, whom he had encouraged to re- volt and to dethrone his father. When they were in his power, with the rest of the royal princes, and the queen with her cher ami, the Prince of Peace, he made them sign an abdica- tion in favour of his brother Joseph, and sent both father, mother, son, and paramour close prisoners to France. He then separated the prince Don Antonio, brother to the king, and the princes from their father, placing one part of the family under the responsibility of the newly-made prince Talleyrand, who was their goaler, and sending the other part to Italy, there to repent at leisure of the folly they had all committed, in trusting to the promises, and putting themselves in the power, of such an unprincipled man as Buonaparte. The particulars of this transaction were re lated to me by the late queen of Spain, whilst she was at Venice : \" My husband, \" added she, \" never abdicated : he allowed my son to take the reins of government, to quell the dis turbances that had broken out in Madrid, and"], [539, "121 ROME and he partially resigned, to prevent the effu sion of blood ; but he was afterwards forced, by Buonaparte's violent conduct and threats, not only to abdicate, but to renounce the suc cession of his chddren to the throne of Spain. In consequence of my remonstrances with him on this breach of good faith, by which he had become perjured, he would allow neither me nor my husband to reside in France ; and the pensions which he promised us, were scarcely ever paid. On our arrival at Marseilles, I parted with some of my jewels, to defray our travelling expences. \" Her majesty further told me, what I thought rather singular, that she had got very little for her jewels, as they were found not to be of the first water.

Lord Burg hersh, too, the British ambassador at the court of Florence, is also said to be bitten with the same musico-mania ; by which, no doubt, the interests of his own country are kept in constant unison with those of this principe-armonico ! The Grand Duke's first wife was the daughter of his two-fold uncle and aunt, the present king and the late queen of Naples ; by whom he had several children. One of his daughters was recently married to the Prince Carignan, who took so active a part in the late transactions in Piedmont. She was greatly deformed, and died, it is said, in consequence of the harsh treatment of her lord and his minister, in not permitting her to have free access to her children. Tuscany is rich in soil. Its inhabitants are industrious ; and many of them who have very circumscribed incomes bear the names of their ancient nobility. Economy and frugality are the praise-worthy characteristics of these Italians ;"], [543, "125 TUSCANY. and the late Grand Duchess \u2014 peace be to her manes ! \u2014 was the very ne plus ultra of all that is avaricious. Indeed, neither of the daugh ters of the noble-minded Caroline of Naples, inherited either their mother's talents, or her unbounded generosity. But, though the sovereignty is absolute, Tus- cany is by no means governed so despotically as the states under the controul of the court of Austria ; and it was even much less so than it is at present, during the reign of the late Duke Leopold ; as Manfredini, who was then the factotum, exercised his power, for years, with great prudence as well as mildness. In point of civilization, the Tuscans are infinitely beyond the rest of the terra firma Italians, and are at the very least a century before hand with the Neapolitans. The Sicilians have gained much, in this respect, from their commercial intercourse with Tuscany ; but the higher classes of society in the island of Sicily are, in point of elegant manners and classical attainments, far behind the people of Florence. The Etruscans appear, by nature, to partake very much of the mildness of their serene and salubrious atmosphere. Their modest simpli city ; their truly elegant manners^ and, above all, the insinuating suavity of the fair and beau-"], [544, "126 TUSCANY. tiful part of the creation, united to the purity of their language, all bespeak them to have been a perfect resemblance of the primitive inhabi tants of the garden of Eden \u2014 \" Grace is in all their steps, heav'n in their eye : In every gesture dignity and love. \" But, alas, since the fatal period of the French revolution, they have been, in no small degree, corrupted by the all-powerful and all-seducing thirst for an imitation of exotic manners, as well as exotic vices, to the exclusion of that native simplicity which is the prime ornament of woman ! The prolificacy ofthe Tuscan soil, if I may be allowed the expression, is as much occasion ed by the judicious manner in which it is cul tivated, as it is by the mildness of its. climate, and the purity of its sky. Not an inch of earth is left idle. Vines, olives, all kinds of fruits, are planted one above the other, in geometrical symmetry ; rising progressively, until they lose themselves in the clouds, and forming, in the vintage season, one of the most enchanting scenes, that nature can pos sibly produce. The common people, as well as the peasantry, speak the language, as settled by the cele brated academy Delia Crusca established at"], [545, "TUSCANY. 127 Florence, in its greatest purity ; and even the beggars in the streets, who ask you for a crazia, which is almost the smallest coin of the country, really do it con grazia, and will often address themselves to a stranger in the classical idiom of their poets, and tell you, that such and such a nobleman has regaled them, on their birth-day, with \" an omelet of four eggs\" \u2014 which, indeed, is by no means a common event ; for the Tuscans are neither rich nor generous, and do not reckon their income by pounds, shillings, and pence, but by the number of flasks of oil or of wine, which is made on their estates. Nay, many of the nobility, both at Florence and at their country residences, will sell you, at their own houses, a single bottle of either. At the side of the door of their palaces, there is usually a little hatch, just big enough to admit a bottle, and a bell ; on the ringing of which, and paying the price, a servant brings the wine or the oil to the purchaser. The Tuscans never impose on foreigners, in the manner practised at Naples and at Genoa. The shop-keepers are remarkably honest, as well as civil ; and particularly so to the English. At Florence, there are three or four very good theatres ; but they are open for per-"], [546, "128 TUSCANY. formances only at a certain season of the year. A good opera is rarely to be met with at Flo rence, except when the principal singers hap pen not to be engaged elsewhere ; as the peo ple are really too poor to pay them sufficiently high salaries ; except during the bathing season at Pisa and Lucca, at which towns there is a great influx of strangers ; and even then the natives are admitted at half-price. At Florence there are numerous private amusements at the houses of the nobility, where concerts are given to strangers in excellent style, as well as other fashionable establish- ments. In former times, the principal families who gave the above weekly conversazioni, were the Duchess Strozzi, the Marchese Santine, Torreggiani, Acciauoli, Corsini, Ruspigliosi, &c. ; besides which, there was the noble public Casino. The Palazzo Pitti, the public garden of Boboli, which commands a most beautiful prospect, the garden of exotics, the gallery of natural history, and the gallery of pictures and of statues \u2014 a full description of which will be found in every itinerary \u2014 are ad chef -d' \u0153uvres of science and of taste. The streets of Florence are all well paved, well lighted up at night, and kept, like the churches and houses, remarkably clean. The"], [547, "129 TUSCAN Y. people of Tuscany are generally very frugal and sober. The Tuscan women are considered well made, and as having fine figures and fair complexions. They dress tolerably well, and are remarkably dignified in their deportment ; but those of Siena are not only proverbially beauti ful, but amiable in their manners ; and their conversation is infinitely more acceptable to a delicate ear, as they speak the Italian language without the harsh guttural aspiration of the Florentines. Arezzo, the birth-place of Mec\u00e6nas and of Petrarch, and anciently called Aretium, is a town of some consideration, situated at the brow of a fertile mountain. Its inhabitants were the only people who made any thing like a resistance to the French invaders. When any ofthe sans-culotte gentry paid them a visit, they were rarely suffered to return to tell tales ; for they put to death every man that had the rash ness to venture amongst them. In character they resemble the Romans more than they do the Tuscans: in shape and make, they are rather stouter and taller than the latter, and infinitely more marked in their features. In general, the men of Tuscany, both in size and figure, are like the English ; and they are not unlike them in manners, excepting that they vol. n. K"], [548, "130 TUSCANY. are more communicative, and more pleasant and agreeable in society ; not quite so rude as to shove people off the pavement, as is not un frequently the case in London ; nor quite so uncivil as to sit with their arms a-kimbo, at the theatres and other public places, in the presence of ladies ; and, like the men of every civilized nation, they are \u2014 for the truth will out ! \u2014 more attentive to the fair sex, than are my worthy countrymen, Messieurs les Anglois. The guttural pronunciation, so peculiar to the Florentines, and so widely different from that of the other states of Italy, is supposed to have arisen from the long residence amongst them of their gothic invaders, in consequence of the extraordinary beauty and fertility of the country. And, no wonder ! \u2014 \" For wheresoe'er I turn my ravish'd eyes Gay gilded scenes and shiniDg prospects rise, Here the sweet muse so oft her harp has strung, That not a mountain rears its head unsung ; Renown'd in verse each shady thicket grows, And every stream in heavenly numbers flows.\" - The Tuscans are easily governed, and hold the memory of the late Grand Duke Leopold, the predecessor of the reigning duke, in great reverence. But, if Ferdinand does not inherit Leopold's abilities, he, at least, possesses the"], [549, "131 TUSCAN Y. milder virtues. In general, the people are attached to his person ; as they are indeed to all his family, considering them as Italians, born and reared up, for the greater part, in Tuscany. They rejoiced at his restoration, but complain bitterly of the influence of the House of Austria ; though the mass of the people were by no means warmly attached to the French. In her rule over the Tuscans, Eliza Bacciochi closely followed the tyrannical footsteps of her brother Napoleon. Various rumours of a scan dalous nature are in circulation respecting the connection between her and young Lucche sini. The insolent and haughtv means re sorted to by her, for the purpose of humiliating the ancient nobility of Tuscany, afforded them frequent opportunities of discovering their sen timents respecting her, by often refusing to pay court to her ; indeed, in 1814, on her depar ture from Tuscany, they shewed towards her the most unequivocal marks of their dislike. The Austrians, who succeeded the French in the temporary possession of Tuscany, did not, however, succeed in conciliating the affec tions of the people. The Florentines were overjoyed at getting rid of them ; although it is said, that their Grand Duke paid several K 2"], [550, "132 TUSCAN Y. millions to the Court of Vienna, by way of compensation. The fact is \u2014 deny it who can ! \u2014 that the Austrians have disgusted the entire people of Italy, by their uncivilized behaviour, their rudeness of manners, their disgusting pride, and the easy indifference with which they appro priate to themselves the goods and chattels of the natives of the countries which they over run, not as deliverers, but as conquerors.

Lucca, the industrious, one of the most ancient, and once one of the most happy re publics, fell beneath the hand of a foreign rapacious invader. In Lucca there was no inquisition \u2014 no arbitrary despotism \u2014 no over-"], [551, "133 LUCCA bearing, bigotted, ecclesiastical authority \u2014 no Venetian oligarchy, so much railed at by the despoiler of Italy ! Nevertheless, Lucca, like the rest of that delightful and magnificent country, has fallen a sacrifice to the bound less ambition of a universal dictator ! Peace and plenty, riches and happiness, were the blessings enjoyed, and enjoyed silently for ages, by this happy little republic. The character of its natives is mild, mode rate, frugal, industrious. The soil, the climate, and the language, resemble, in every respect, those of its polished neighbours ; as the natives also do both in their manners and customs. By Buonaparte this little republic was trans mogrified into a dukedom, under the name of Lucca Piombino, to admininister to the am bition of Eliza Bacciochi, the eldest and the favoured sister of the Corsican, who took upon herself the title of Grand Duchess ofthe same ; though she could only be considered as a subor dinate agent to the grand carver of European destinies. When the nobility of Lucca were first pre sented to Bacciochi, their harmless blockhead of a grand duke, who had not long before been a marker at a billiard-table, they apologized to their newlv-made sovereign for their ignorance K S"], [552, "134 LUCCA. of court etiquette, observing, that they never before had had the honour of having a grand duke ; to whom Bacciochi replied with a laugh, \" Never mind, gentlemen : we'll excuse each other : for I am as great a novice in my new situation, as any of you can possibly be in yours.\" His christian name was Pascal, which in Italy is an appellation not held in the highest vene ration, since it is synonimous with that of dunce. Accordingly, on his being appointed the foot-stool prince of Lucca, Buonaparte, who looked upon every member of his imperial and royal family as being nothing more than subordinate agents, gave directions to Bacciochi to take upon himself the dignified name of Felix the First ; a circumstance which gave rise to the following jeu d'esprit \u2014 \" Quando tu eri Pasquali, noi eravamo tutti felici : or, che tu sei Felice, noi siam tutti Pasquali.\" Bacciochi was a harmless, insignificant bon vivant. His wife, on the contrary, was so im pudently ostentatious, that she was generally disliked. When she paid a visit to Venice, she took up her residence in the palace Cor naro, on the grand canal, called the Palazzo della Ca Grande. Marina Cornaro, the Pisani of San Steftano, one of the most distinguished of"], [553, "135 LUCCA the patricians, as well as one of the most virtu ous, amiable, and charitable ladies in all Venice, waited upon this mushroom duchess, to enquire if her highness was comfortably lodged and accommodated ; but though in her own palace, and defraying the expenses of its table, she was not suffered to sit down in the presence of her parvenue of a visitor. Lucca is at present under the authority of Maria Louisa, a sister of the \" beloved \" Fer- dinand of Spain, and widow of Louis, one of the brood of kings whom Buonaparte made and unmade. She was one of his first queens of Etruria, created at the moderate price of eight millions of livres, which he received from her father, Charles the Fourth of Spain ; though her husband had been by him deprived of the dukedom of Parma, his hereditary dominions. After the death of her short-lived king and husband, she was intended, by Buonaparte, to be the second wife of his brother Lucien ; but, not being inclined to follow the example of Napoleon, in divorcing one wife in order to make room for another, the match did not take place ; which circumstance is supposed to have given birth to the quarrel between them. Had he but remained firm in his resistance to the ambitious views of his brother, to the end ofthe k 4"], [554, "136 LUCCA farce of king-making, Lucien would have im mortalized himself as much for his moderation, as his brother Napoleon has been \" damned to everlasting fame,\" for his unlimited and insatiable ambition. Un fortunately, however, the alacrity with which he stepped forward to assist his brother to re mount the throne which he had solemnly re nounced his right to, proves but too clearly, that if Napoleon, at the former period, had con sented to have crowned Lucien's obscure wife, he would, like the rest of his brothers, have accepted the poor and humble pittance of a kingdom. The reconciliation of the one bro ther, and the unexpected activity of the other, is pretty clearly accounted for in a letter which was intercepted, and by which it evidently appears, that Napoleon had a new kingdom in petto, for this long neglected sprig of the imperial Corsican tree. His refining pot was once more to have been put into the furnace, for the purpose of melting down into oblivion the recollection of the porter's daughter, and to bronze her over with the varnish of majesty; and, there is little doubt, that the Princess of Canino would have cut as good a figure pn the imperial stage, as the rest of the"], [555, "LUCCA 137 Buonaparte-breed of actors and actresses have done. Besides the above eight millions of livres paid to Napoleon, Lucien had received a con siderable sum in the way of brokerage, for being the mediator in this affair, as well as for having been the ostensible person commis sioned by the Queen of Spain and the prince of peace, to negociate the preliminaries of peace between France and Spain. He there fore un-duchessed her to make her a queen, and afterwards un-queened her to make a duchess of his imperial sister, Bacciochi! While the present duchess of Lucca was the mock-queen of Etruria,and,iwe versd, Eliza Bac ciochi was Duchess of Lucca Piombino (which latter title belonged to the noble family of the Lovisis, the Prince of Piombini, then living at Rome) the assumed democracy of the real princess, and the aristocratical preten sions of the democratical princess, occasioned them to live in tolerably good fellowship with each other, and especially in all matters in which they could assist and further the policy of their mutual patron and master ; the neces sity they were under of doing which is the best excuse that can be found for the conduct they pursued. As the satellites which revolved"], [556, "138 LUCCA round the Napoleon orb, were one and all compelled to dance to his music, and to sing too, whenever he commanded them \u2014 for with the mighty man it was \" No song no supper,\" \u2014 both of them paid a visit to Leghorn, and when there went on board a merchant ship from Malta, under the pretence of interrogating the captain, respecting the route which Mrs. Spen cer Smith had taken, after she had escaped from the officer who had arrested her at Brescia. But this was a mere pretence. The lady they were really in quest of was one who had been arrested at the same time with Mrs. Spencer Smith, while she was at Venice on a visit to her sister, the Countess of Attemis, and who had also fled from her gaolers in a small fishing boat, and traversed the Adriatic, until she had fallen in with the British fleet, which was then blockading the Venetian ports ; and who was taken up by one of Admiral Fremantle's ships, and carried triumphantly to Malta. What the illustrious ladies wanted, was to get possession of the captain's journal, for the purpose of finding out the route she had pursued, that they might give intelligence to the French police to have her arrested, in case it found out where she resided. But the lady was"], [557, "139 LUCCA fortunately safe at Palermo. The two im perial and royal agents were consequently obliged to return to their respective steward ships as they came, re infectd \u2014 and greatly mor tified at the miscarriage of their honourable, most honourable, commission ! For the flight, and safe arrival of Mrs. Spencer Smith at Vienna, had been announced in all the public papers. It was effected through the assistance of a Neapolitan gentleman, who followed her from Venice to Brescia, taking with him a male dis guise, in which she equipped herself, and, in stead of going to rest, by the means of a lad der which the gentleman procured, and placed at the first floor window of the inn in which she was to pass the night, she made her escape ; and the next morning, when the officer came to her bedroom door to call her up, with the intention of proceeding on their march, the bird was flown, and already in Switzerland ; having taken the route of the Lago Maggiore \u2014 as she afterwards informed me herself, when I met her at Vienna. On these occasions, the French were not very gallant ; for they would make the ladies walk nearly as if they were prisoners of war, or, what is worse, common soldiers. This was the case"], [558, "140 LUCCA with poor Mrs. Watson, an elderly lady, the wife of the last British Consul at Venice. When the French first entered this city, her husband having been sent, by Sir Richard Wors ley, with dispatches to England, they took her prisoner, and dragged her about, from one place to another, for the space of nearly eight years. In consequence of this ill-treatment, and her being often obliged to lay down her weary limbs on the high roads, she returned to Venice, on the downfall of her cruel op pressor, a complete cripple, totally deprived of the use of her limbs, from her hips down wards; and there she remained untd death kindly put an end to her sufferings I The truth was, that Napoleon's police were so ashamed of having been outwitted by a couple of ladies, that they exerted every means to get them again within their power; but, finding they could not obtain their wicked ends, they became so outrageouly exasperated, that they arrested all the English travellers they could find in Italy. The Countess At tends, however, the sister to Mrs. Spencer Smith, became afterwards the dame d'atour of the ex-queen of Naples, who is now the wife of Marshal Macdonald."], [559, "141 LUCCA When the present Grand Duchess of Lucca was dethroned by Buonaparte, she was ordered by him to repair with her son to Milan, there to await his further instructions, as to their future destination. It is said that Murat, the then governor of Lombardy, moved to com passion by her distressed situation, paid her the most marked attentions ; which were not lost on the widowed queen. But this so roused the jealousy of the great lady his wife, that she contrived to have her removed from the scene of danger, least the growing attachment should become reciprocal \u2014 as it is well known that Spanish ladies are not entirely insensible to the attractions of handsome French officers. She was, therefore, soon sent off to her future des tination in Spain. It is also said, that she was extremely jealous of a German princess, who resided some time at Naples, previously to her going to Egypt ; but, it was not so easy a matter to persuade king Murat to send this lady away from Naples, as it had been to send away the Queen of Etru ria from Milan. Sound policy prevented such a step ; for this lady happened to stand high in the estimation of a part of the British na tion ; and, founding great hopes on her popu larity and foreseeing the result of the Isle of"], [560, "142 L U C C A Elba affair, the influence of that lady was looked up to as a source of protection in the hour of danger. A certain noble lady, as distinguished for her personal charms as she has been for her prolific qualities, and who was once the cher amie of a distinguished member of the English opposition, contrived to strengthen the hopes and expectations of this puff-paste king ; but, his elevation being built on a rotten foundation, all was of no avail, and the whole fabric fell to the ground ; the principal actor having been shot as a criminal, merely because it was more convenient and expeditious to put him out of existence in that manner, than by hang ing him up by the neck. What a useful lesson does the melancholy end of this mushroom branch of the Napoleon dynasty, who had been originally a postillion, and afterwards a scullion in the Prince of Conde's kitchen at Chantilly, present to the reflecting mind !

But, such is the natural consequence of gross superstition, and the arbitrary and vexatious power of an oppressive government ! Too long have they been subjected to the tooth less controul of old women and of a wily priest hood, and much do they stand in need of being roused from that state of feeble infancy to mature manhood, before they shall be fitted for the enjoyment of rational liberty and inde pendence. But, what can be looked for from"], [562, "144 PARMA AND MODENA. them, so long as they shall continue to be kept in such an abject state of slavery, that if a sub ject, in passing by the carriage of one of their princes or princesses \u2014 even though it were an infant at the breast of its nurse\u2014 were to omit to take off his hat, he would be instantly ar rested, and thrown, like a common felon, de graded and dishonoured, into a dungeon, with out a hearing before judge or jury ; and, if he should dare to remonstrate, and enquire on what account he has been thus treated, he would be insolently told, that \" that would be known by the punishment.\" The dignity of our social existence impe riously demands, that we should soar above the level of the brute creation ; but that can only be done through the free agency of our faculties ; for when the exercise of those faculties is ille gally impeded, instead of soaring above, we sink infinitely beneath them. Man, being con stantly at variance with his fellow, is the only ani mal that counteracts nature ; a fact this, which is demonstrated by the violence to which a human being resorts, the moment he attains the mastery over that power, by whose over bearing oppressions his energies have been borne down and repressed. The truth of this has been fatally evinced by all modem revolu-"], [563, "145 PARMA AND MODENA. tionists ; and it will continue to be so, until a just equipoise shall be established between the governors and the governed. Although, therefore, the recent movements in Italy, and particularly in Naples and Pied mont, have, for the moment, been unsuccess ful, it is highly improbable that they should not be renewed, and break out with redoubled energy, from the recollection of former mis carriages. The fire may at present lie dor mant ; but, like its neighbouring volcanoes, it is not extinguished, and, sooner or later, it will burst forth, and bury in its ashes the ene mies of freedom, and lay the foundation of a new Pompeii or a new Herculaneum !

It is necessary for me to mention thus precisely this long list of imperial ancestry, to showr that nature will predominate, and that, when no longer re- strained, and when the motives of ungovern- able ambition no longer existed, this lady felt for her own dignity : though, while the allure- ment of being the consort of the first sovereign in Europe was floating in her fancy, every con- sideration of blood, of rank, of birth, and, I may say, of decency, was sacrificed to the am bition of sharing the usurped throne of one of her own relations. All, however, vanished and disappeared, as soon as the main spring of that ambition had been crushed and sent into exile. A lady of rank, the wife of a Venetian gen tleman, and a member of the republic of let ters, who had been commissioned to write a poem in praise of the Ex-emperor, \" her be loved husband and the dear father of her only son,\" \u2014 for such, it is said, was the language of the affectionate empress while the emperor was in his glory) \u2014 presented a copy of the said poem, which had been intended for Napoleon himself, had the events of the war not proved"], [565, "PARMA AND MODENA. 147 so fatal to him. Buonaparte, being, in point of generosity towards literary undertakings, which he encouraged as a part of his immor tality, very different from the great Wellington, had subscribed for a hundred copies, besides obliging his staff to subscribe for a hundred more ; but, as I have observed, from the above mentioned reverses, the copies were not taken, nor were they paid for. The author's wife, as well as the work, were both most flatteringly received by the dame d'atour of her imperial majesty, who assured the lady, that it should be instantly presented to her, at the same time requesting the lady to call at the palace on the following morning, when she would receive her imperial majesty's commands, and would probably have the honour of being admitted to her august presence. The work was printed in the best style, and richly covered with crimson velvet, embroidered, in the most costly and elegant manner, with the united arms of France and Austria, as com manded, in pure gold foil on each side of the oc ver, and the coronets inserted in coloured stones. The lady, according to directions, waited on the dame d'atour the next morning, and was ushered into a room, where she found her L 2"], [566, "148 PARMA AND MODENA in bed, and by whom, to her great astonish ment, she was thus accosted : \" Madam, the empress, my august mistress, has commanded me to return to you the book, and to inform you, that she is much surprized you should have the hardihood to present her with any thing that relates to that bad man Napoleon : further, she desires me to say, that, as you are an Austrian subject, you may think yourself fortunate, that she does not denounce you to her imperial father, who would certainly punish you for your presumption, in presenting her with a work of the kind.\" The lady, though much surprized at such an unexpected reception, said \u2014 that if \" Na poleon were politically upon the list of dead sovereigns, his exploits were not so amongst great men.\" \u2014 \" Very like, very like : but Na poleon was a very bad man \" \" Then, madam, if I am to be punished for having presented the work of my husband, what is to become of Cesarotti, who wrote an elaborate epic poem on the warlike achievements of the Archduke Charles \u2014 and who, when the Austrian army had been driven out of Italy by the French, only changed the name of Charles for that of Napoleon, and presented the identical work to"], [567, "149 PARMA AND MODENA. the French, instead ofthe Austrian, conqueror? And, did not the celebrated Monti, the author of the \" Bassevilliana,\" who wrote so much against the French and all the French parti zans, on Napoleon's becoming the master of Austria and the dictator of Europe, employ the whole of his time, during the reign of the said dictator, in expiating his first crime, by unceasing eulogia ? In short, have not all the poets, for these twenty years past, nearly exhausted their genius, in singing the praises of the greathero, whose achievements have outstrip ped poetical imagination ? What punishment, then, ought to be awarded to the Emperor of Austria, for having accepted, sanctioned, and circulated many of these effusions ; giving his daughter in marriage to him, and she having not only accepted him for a husband, but sub mitted to have a child by him, knowing him, all the time, to be utterly unworthy of the sacri fice which they were both consenting to make ?\" To all which no other answer was given to the lady, but the repetition of the assertion, that Napoleon was \" a very bad man :\" but, from a motion of the dame d'atour, the lady was fully convinced, that her imperial majesty had been within hearing during the whole of the conversation. But, whether she was or was l 3"], [568, "150 PARMA AND MODENA. not, it is quite certain that the dame d'atour would never have dared to express herself in the manner she had done, if she had not been encouraged thereto by her imperial mistress. If such, then, were the sentiments of the wife of Napoleon, while he was still at Elba, what must they have been when he was lost, beyond redemption, in the Island of St. Helena, with no probability of her being any thing beyond an Ex \u2014 . But General will no doubt console her imperial majesty ; for he certainly has the credit of seeing more with one eye, than other persons can with two ! The reigning Duke of Modena is said to be the most frugal prince of the age. He travels with his own provisions ; and what he happens not to eat one day, is carefully packed up, and laid aside for the next. And truly, this is most praise-worthy conduct in sovereigns ; who, when they are on their travels, ought not to dissipate their incomes on postillions and inn keepers, but should rather bear in memory, that it is not talent or merit, but the sweat from the brow of the labourer, that pays the piper ; besides, according to the good old pro verb, \" waste makes want,\" and the man who thinks of a rainy day, is always prepared against state emergencies."], [569, "PARMA AND MODENA. 151 By a rigid perseverance in this system, the late Duke of Modena, after years of the most rigorous economy in his table, his dress, and his household establishment, contrived to accumu late immense wealth; with the loan of which he would oftentimes assist his loving subjects \u2014 upon good security ! On the arrival of the French, he fled, with the treasures he had hoarded, to Venice ; which treasures he might have preserved ; but, rather than take a boat to himself, at the enormous charge of about fifteen or .twenty ducats, he staid until the enemy arrived, and immediately disencumbered him ofthe whole of his property. So much for rigid economy ! The present Duke of Modena married, in June 1812, his niece, Maria Beatrice, the daughter of his sister, the Queen of the ab dicated King of Sardinia. The duke and the above queen are the offspring of the Arch duchess Beatrice and the late Arch-duke of Milan.

Milan, once the capital of the kings of Lombardy, is an immense city, and has been much enlarged, extended, and improved, since the period of the French Revolution. It was the residence of the Viceroy of Italy, Prince Eugene Beauharnais ; and may now be con sidered the Paris of Italy ; the seat of luxury, commerce, arts, sciences, and amusements ; and the military parade of the whole kingdom of Italy. The seat of government was to have been divided between Venice and Milan ; but the court seldom left the latter city, except for a few days at a time. Indeed, the mode of living"], [571, "153 M I L A N. at Venice is only calculated for Venetian-born subjects. Milan is situated in the very centre of Lom bardy, in a flat country, richly cultivated, and relieved from a monotonous appearance, by the fine views of the hills of Varese, -and of Mount di Brianza, famous for its excellent wines. It is completely encircled by the Na vaglio, which is a source of considerable wealth, from the communication it affords to the rivers Tesino, Lario, Olona, Adda, and the Lago Mag giore, all of which run into the Po. From the immense number of hydraulic operations, Lom bardy is irrigated at all seasons of the year ; in consequence of which, it annually produces three, four, and even five crops of every neces sary as well as luxury of life. The peasantry in Austrian Lombardy, are, for the most part, landed proprietors, who are too wealthy, too much occupied with rural concerns, and too great epicures, to feel the least thirst after mditary glory. They are, therefore, of a disposition much less warlike than that of the rest of the Italians. The active movements that have shown themselves, announcing a desire to shake off the yoke of the foreigner, and of thereby secur ing the emancipation of their country, have"], [572, "154 MILAN. hitherto been confined to three classes ; name ly, the gentlemen of the bar, the literati, and the members of the ancient aristocracy. The Milanese are passionately fond of public amusements. They scarcely think of any thing but the pleasures of the opera, the Corso, or Le Belle Ragazze. Unless roused by the exam ple of their more warlike neighbours to exert themselves in the cause of their country, they generally look on until the blow is struck. Such was the case at the period of Murat's invasion, when they took especial care not to commit themselves ; and, by doing which, they then avoided the train of those horrible mur ders, exiles, and cruel military punishments, that were inflicted, by the exasperated con queror, on the inhabitants of the towns and cities of Italy which had offered a resistance ; and more especially upon the unfortunate Bo lognese. The people of Milan have had, from time immemorial, a certain compact among them, that whenever a foreign enemy shall have entered Lombardy, and arrived within a cer tain distance of Milan, the most courageous of its inhabitants shall be dispatched to the invading enemy, with the keys of their city ; as they have a proverb amongst them : \" salviamo"], [573, "155 MILA N. la panza, per i figlii.\" By so doing, they, at any rate, escape those horrors which are gene rally the attendants on the sacking of a city. Previously to the French revolutionists hav ing taken possession of this truly rich country, Milan was considered one of the most respect able cities in all Europe. It abounds in mag nificent public and private buildings, worthy, in every respect, of an enlightened nation ; amongst which are its hospitals and colleges, its churches, theatres, museums ; its amphi theatre, and its justly celebrated Duomo or cathedral, in which Napoleon was crowned King of Italy, with the corona di ferro, used by the Gothic Lombard kings on those occa sions, and where also he instituted the order ofthe Iron Crown, bearing for its device the words, \" Dio mi l'ha dato : guai a chi me la tocca !\" \" Oh, England, England, what a pro fanation hast thou made of this mighty man's works !\" exclaimed a certain member of his family, on his being sent to the Island of St. Helena. The profusion of luxury that was displayed on the above occasion, in decorating this im posing structure; the military pomp and parade; the splendid ornaments with which every part of the interior of this vast cathedral, the largest"], [574, "156 MILA N. in Europe, was covered ; the profusion of spark ling diamonds, the costliness and variety of the dresses of the male and female attendants of the courts, not to mention those of the em peror and empress, the imperial family, the foreign princes, the ministers, the corps diplo matique, and the clergy, were, perhaps, never before equalled, and certainly not exceeded. In the midst of one of these fetes, Na poleon, observing that the Marchesa Busca, daughter of the Duke di Serbelloni \u2014 who, though very rich, was more inclined to be just, and charitable to the poor, than lavish and extravagant towards milliners and dress makers \u2014 observing, I say, that she always appeared at court in the same robes, said to her, in the hearing of the whole assembly, \" I am afraid, my dear Marchesa, that you have been very much fatigued?\" \u2014 \"Not in the least, please your majesty ; why should you think so ?\" said she. \" Because,\" answered the emperor, \"you have not been out of your clothes for these six days.\" The polished Italians call Lombardy the B\u0153otia of the peninsula. It has nevertheless produced some very distinguished men of let ters, as well as artists. Appiani, for instance, was considered the Milanese Polignotus and"], [575, "157 MILAN. Apelles ; and especially for his fresco paint ings. From his great knowledge of mythology, theology, and general history, no doubt was left of the subjects of his several compositions ; for they pointed out to the spectator, page, chapter, and verse, whence he had taken them. From the encouragement which Buonaparte gave to men of learning and science, Milan became the seat of literature. Cesarotti, Monti, Parini, Giani, and most of the modern Italian poets, made it their place of residence ; and particularly under the vice-consulship of Melzi, Duke of Lodi, whose administration was cer tainly mild, impartial, just, and disinterested ; until, unfortunately and fatally for himself, he became attached to the Sultana Grimaldi, one of the ladies belonging to the seraglio of Momfrin, the snuff-merchant at Venice, who afterwards married a gambler by profession ; whom Melzi employed, and through whose blind infatua tion, and that of Majon, Prince Eugene's secretary, another partner in her private fa vours, she soon became mistress of the most important situations under the government ; which she and her husband are said to have sold to the best bidders. During the tran sactions of the firm of Majon and Melzi with this man-trap, she contrived to carry on some"], [576, "158 MILA N. very important, as well as lucrative affairs ; by which she not only dishonoured and dis graced them, but became the original cause of the unpopularity which discovered itself, on the part of the nobility, towards the vice roy himself. It was a fact well known at Milan, that Grimaldi married this Margarite Prati, the daughter of the poor Prati of Treviso, entirely upon speculation ; intending her for one of his customers, Nicoletto Cornaro, knowing him to have a penchant for women of her descrip tion ; and, by obtaining money from him in one way, and his new wife in another, he calculated on making a comfortable for tune between the two ; but the ruffian of a gambler succeeded better with Cornaro than his wife ; for he plundered him of considerable sums of money. The Prati, however, did not turn out to the good man's fancy ; upon discovering which, Grimaldi, mad with disap pointment, could not refrain from exclaiming, \" Zounds, I married the tall lath of a thing, because I thought she would just suit his fancy ; but his passion is now for the en bon point, and here am I saddled with this scrag of a trollop on my own shoulders.\""], [577, "159 MILA N. This demirep and her husband, before they came to Milan, had been sent out of Paris by the police, in consequence of their having won a considerable sum of money from General Springporten, then the Russian minister. For tunate was it for them, that a considerable number of persons who had made themselves obnoxious to the people, took to their heels on the prince's leaving Milan ; for if they had not done so, assuredly many an additional umbrella would have been employed, in re venge for the public plunder, by which numerous individuals had enriched them selves. The Lombardian male creation are certainly not the descendants of those who discovered the use of the globes ; nor are they to be numbered amongst the most enlightened or civdized. Nevertheless, they are good-natured, disposed to render themselves useful, are at tached to strangers, and truly hospitable. The females are handsome, and inclined to the en bon point. They have fine eyes, and interest ing figures. They dress very becomingly, and attract notice ; until they open their mouths, when the admirer becomes instantly shocked and disgusted, at the vulgarity of their man ners, and at their gross Milanese dialect."], [578, "160 MILAN. Buonaparte certainly did every thing in his power for the benefit of the Lombardians in general, and for the happiness of the Milanese in particular. He promoted every kind of com merce, excepting that with England. He en couraged their manufactures, employed thou sands of hands in improving the public roads, and expended millions in beautifying their city, in planting trees, and in opening pub lic gardens and promenades for their accom modation and comfort. He also sanctioned various amusements for the recreation of the different classes ofthe people. The constant residence of a most brilliant and splendid court, presided over by a hand some, virtuous, and prolific princess, the mo ther of a numerous and a beautiful family, with a good-humoured, humane, aud well intentioned prince at their head, all tended, no doubt, to make Eugene Beauharnois popular, and the people attached to his authority ; which, though vigorous, was accompanied by incalculable advantages, which diffused them selves generally throughout Lombardy ; but which are now, alas, in part at least, if not wholly, fled ; from the change which the peo ple have undergone, in being placed under the yoke of Austria \u2014 a change, which has left the"], [579, "M I L A N. 161 strongest sense of regret in the minds of all those who are capable of comparing their present degraded situation, with the blessings which they once enjoyed. It is beyond doubt clear, that low, calcu lating avarice is the natural characteristic of a certain race of beings, in the same way as liberality and generosity are the distin guishing features of another ; and that both become hereditary in different families. Hence it is, that the immediate descendants of the immortal Maria Theresa were, in general, re markable for their generosity ; excepting one or two individuals, whose children, to this day, demonstrate to the world, that they put into rigid practice all the precepts of their undoubted maternal grand-father, and their father. The living examples to whom I allude, are his royal highness the Grand Duke of Mo dena, and his royal sister Leopoldina, widow of the late elector, Charles Theodore of Ba varia ; and, as they establish the existence of family virtues and family vices, I will here briefly narrate what has been told me of her royal highness the Electress Leopoldina, as I have already done of her royal brother of Modena. VOL. II. M"], [580, "162 MILAN. Though the daughter of the Arch-duchess Beatrice, who was considered the best informed princess of the Austrian imperial family, the education of Leopoldina has been totally neg lected. Her manners and sentiments are far below those of a simple gentlewoman. With a perpetual desire to set about every thing, she is utterly incapable of effecting any thing that shall discover her to have been born a princess. Her unnatural and unconquerable aversion to all her family, and more especially to her mo ther, is her most striking characteristic. When the French entered Piedmont, her parents being on the eve of quitting Milan, the good elector, her husband, proposed their coming to Munich. \"And if they do,\" answered she, \" as soon as they enter at one door, out will I go at the other ; not a soul of the family will I have here.\" The elector, of course, desisted from his intention of inviting them, and they were, in consequence, obliged to proceed to Vienna. When her marriage with Charles Theodore, who was then seventy years of age, and she little more than seventeen, was first proposed to her, she enquired of the match-makers, \" whether she was to be a reigning sovereign ?\" Being answered in the affirmative, she replied,"], [581, "163 MILA N. \" Then, I'd marry the devil to get out of my mother's clutches :\" and certainly, during the elector's life time, though they were as diame trically opposite in their natures, as mounts Caucasus and Etna, she conducted herself to wards her old lord and master with the most scrupulous constancy and fidelity, as well as in every other respect, excepting, perhaps, some trifling juvenile tricks ; such as going to the convents, with a number of young persons, like herself, then ordering a dance, and calling the poor pent-up nuns to the grate of the parlatorio, amusing herself with tantalizing them by talking of that which they could not enjoy, and cruelly asking them a number of questions, which had the effect of making them restless and uncomfortable for the remainder ofthe night. The electress contracted a partiality for a professional lady, of some celebrity, who was in the service of the court, and often invited her to accompany her in her morning walks at Niphenburg, The gardens being damp, the lady, on her return, wished, naturally, to change her dress. Upon observing which, the electress would exclaim, \" Mercy, on us ! you'll ruin yourself in washing ! Look here, and see what I do ;\" lifting up the front of her dress, which, m 2"], [582, "164 MILA N. though very much soiled with the mud, she would roll up and fasten with two or three pins, and in this state she would set down to dinner with the old elector ; who was really a man of considerable talents. Sometimes, if the elector had happened to have displeased her \u2014 (and it is not very likely that an old German of seventy, had the faculty of pleasing a young woman in any great de gree) \u2014 she would go into the dining-room, and hide herself under the table. When the din ner was served, her husband would look round and ask where the electress was ? Upon which, she would pinch his gouty legs, and nearly spoil his dinner from the pain she would give him. Whenever she particularly wished for any thing, she would, like Lady Teazle in the School for Scandal, tell him how* happy she was, and that she never would offend him again ; and, the better to gain her point, she would make him believe that she was in a thriving way. No sooner, however, had he granted her re quest, than she would exclaim, in a horse laugh, \" Lord, lord, what an idiot you must be, to fancy such a thing ! I shall always be a virgin, as long as I am your wife\" \u2014 \" io non posso sperare che lo spirito santo condescen ded di far mi altrimenti !\""], [583, "165 MILAN. She would have her court dresses cut and altered into six or seven different shapes and forms. When first made up, she would wear it as it came from the dress-maker ; secondly, she would order the front breadth to be changed ; in the third place, she would have different sleeves put to it ; fourthly, a new body ; fifthly, a trimming of flowers ; sixthly, a trimming of French blond ; seventhly and lastly, a trimming of ribbons. And, having done all this, she would laugh with the lady above alluded to, at the idea of her having so completely imposed on the females of the court, as to have kept them in total ignorance of the deception played on them by her avarice. It so happened, that the lady in question had invented a very handsome gold filligree trim ming, which she humbly presented to her royal highness, who was so much pleased with it, that she said she would sit for her picture and present it to the lady, in token of the satisfac tion she felt at the inventor's kind attention ; and, as it was near the season, when the court permitted a six months' conge to the first-rate performers at her private concerts, her royal highness told her she should have it, with the souvenir that the elector also intended to pre sent to her previously to her departure from M 3"], [584, "166 M I L A N. Munich. In addition to which, her royal high ness obligingly said, \" as the people of Munich have never heard you, I would advise you to take a public concert before you leave Bavaria. I will sing for you ; the orchestra and all the professionals of the court shall assist ; and, in the mean time, I will write to my aunts of In spruck and Naples, to request them to interest themselves in your behalf, if you should be in clined to give a concert ateither of those places.\" The lady thanked her royal highness, and acknowledged the sense she entertained of her very gracious condescension. She said, she should feel herself highly honoured by the let ters, but begged leave to decline the other parts of her royal highness's offer ; well know ing that her royal highness general sang in one tune, and the orchestra in another, \u2014 a circum stance, which, however it might pass in the court of an Arch Duchess, would never do with professors, nor before an audience, who, as they paid for their admission, might not be quite so indulgent to their sovereign, as they were wrhen in the gallery of the court, into which they had been admitted gratis. Besides, this lady had already given her opi nion respecting the incorrectness of her royal highness's ear; for, on the elector putting the"], [585, "167 MILA N. question to her one day, she had replied, that \" the ears of her royal highness might have been otherwise engaged, but, that certainly she sang like a princess.\" At which the elector laughed heartily, as he was himself a great amateur, and had always the first Italian and German professors at his court. However, as ignorant people are generally the most head strong, her royal highness would take no denial ; and, as a further inducement, \" send me \" she said, \" a certain number of tickets ;\" which the lady of course thought her royal highnessintend ed to distribute among the persons of the court. The price of the tickets was two crowns each. Her royal highness, however, sentthe court pages round to every individual at Munich she could think of, tothegreat disadvantage of \\iev protegee; as many who would have been disposed to pay much more than the regular price, if they had come from the lady herself, did not chuse to do so by the electress. But, what is most extraor dinary, she actually paid the lady for the tick ets in Bavarian crowns, upon which there was a loss of a livre on each crown ; for her royal highness had certainly received French crowns, but her avarice led her to speculate on the most trifling objects. It was, however, so much gained towards the expence of the shoes ofthe pages ; m 1"], [586, "168 MILA N. who had run about Munich to distribute the tickets. How different was the conduct of Mr. Dor ner, a merchant of Hamburgh ! for when this lady gave a concert in that city, he took a couple of hundred tickets at the above price, and, while entertaining her at breakfast, select ing one of the tickets out of the packet for his own use, and throwing the rest into the fire, he gave her a draft on his banker for the amount of the whole. At the death of the old elector, her royal highness most democratically took it into her head to set off from Munich with the brother of Heck, the first violin player of the court ; and, though he was only second in the orchestra, he managed his bow so well, as to play first fiddle on the heart of her roval highness ; for she actually would have married him, had they not been overtaken and arrested before she had an opportunity of putting her determination into execution. On her return to Munich, she was severely reprimanded for the step she had so rashly taken. On being told by one of her friends, that she was not the only Austrian princess who had formed a private attachment, but that for thinking of so far degrading and dishonouring"], [587, "169 M I L A N. herself and her family as to project a marriage with one so infinitely beneath her, she merited the severest punishment, she replied, \" no, if I cannot have him as my husband, I will have him on no other terms.\" Shortly after this, she was sent, under a strong escort, to Laybach, to which place she was exiled for some time, and in which she continued to carry on all sorts of commercial speculations. After the marriage of her late sister with the Emperor of Austria, she was permitted to return to Munich, where she mar ried a private individual, by whom she has had two or three children. To enrich them, she mo nopolizes as much as possible all the produce of the country, and is looked on as the forestaller of every article that grows on the earth. Upon market days, her apartments are crowded with farmers. She goes rarely to court, and sees no other society than that of brokers, farmers, and stock-jobbers. If an artist presents himself to her, she tells him she is not such a fool as to spend her money upon such nonsense as paintings, books, statues, poetry, and music. The lady above-mentioned having had occa sion, about four years ago, to pass through Munich, did herself the honour of paying h*3'*"], [588, "170 MILA N. dutiful respects to those truly amiable and truly paternal sovereigns, the present king and queen of Bavaria, and also to prince Eugene and his beautiful consort, and she there saw their lovely family. She also called on her royal highness, the late electress, who, to do her justice, received her while she was at dinner, with every mark of her former kind condescension. On enter ing the apartment, her royal highness ordered the servant to withdraw. The dinner consisted of a miserable mutton chop, a potatoe, a half pint bottle of wine, and a lemon, which she cut into two, and, together with the re mains of the wine, carefully put by for the next day. She complained bitterly of her poverty, and expressed herself mightily pleased with the lady's attention, in remembering her after the many years that had elapsed since she saw her. The electress putting by the half of a lemon and the dregs of a small bottle of wine, was in perfect unison with what I have related of her royal brother, the Duke of Modena, carrrying about his dinners from day to day, when on his travels. How few are there of the present race of princes who merit to be handed down to poste terity, for acts of charity, liberality, or gene-"], [589, "MILAN 171 rosity ! And, how grateful ought they to be to those men of talent who bring them into public notice ! From the rank which they hold in society, they ought to be distinguished, if I may be allowed the expression, for a vicious generosity ; for, as charity is said to cover a multitude of sins, so does generosity hide a host of defects ! But some of these eminent characters \u2014 to their shame be it spoken \u2014 are not only destituteof generosity, but of justice ; and will even stoop to accept the mental labours of a female without paying for them ! Let such persons bear in mind, that a man of talent is the noblest work of the Creator. The antients were accustomed to reverence all such, and to look up to them with a degree of respect, bor dering on religious veneration, and considered themselves honoured when men of genius con descended to notice them in the effusions of their brilliant imaginations \u2014 \" Sed tempera mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis.\""], [590, "172 CHAPTER XV.

I shall now redeem the promise which I made in my first volume, at page 275, and present my reader with some interesting anec dotes ofthe exploits of the Buonaparte Famdy in Italy, from the first arrival of the Corsican in the Milanese territory, down to the over throw of tlie grand Napoleon dynasty. The first time Buonaparte's name was men tioned in Italy, was at a dinner given at Flo rence by Lord Hervey, the British minister, to a gentleman who had come from Toulon"], [591, "M I L A N. 173 with Horatio Nelson, then the commander of the Agamemnon, in company with Mr. Ud ney the British consul at Leghorn ; at which dinner I had the honour of being one of the party. The loss of Toulon becoming the subject of regret, one of the gentlemen expressed himself in the following terms respecting the re-taking of it by the French : \" The most active and obstinate of all the officers,\" said he, \" was a little ill-looking fellow with a sallow com plexion, whom I learnt to be a Lieutenant Buonaparte, possessing the most extraordinary countenance I ever beheld.\" This short speech, though of no great mo ment at the time, made a deep impression on my mind, more from the energy with which it was uttered, than from the importance of the individual who had been the subject of it ; as the name of Buonaparte had not at that period, excited the slightest sensation in Europe. This happened in the year 1793. However, two years afterwards, when Buonaparte came to Italy, at the head of the French army, so greatly had my curiosity been excited by the aforesaid energetic speech, that I determined on setting out from Venice, with a party of"], [592, "174 MILAN friends, for Milan, principally from a desire to see whether the countenance of the juvenile warrior answered the description which the gentleman had given of it. On our arrival at Milan, Buonaparte was then actually reviewing the troops in the Piazza di Castello, afterwards called the Fora Buona parte. On alighting from my carriage, I was placed in the best possible situation for view ing the young hero, and I must confess that I found him to answer, in every respect, the description that had been given me of him ; he being then extremely thin, and of a sallowr complexion. When giving the word of com mand, he appeared to be perfectly in his ele ment: but, that being over, he instantly looked quite another being. He appeared evidently to be struggling to adapt and vary his features to the subject matter that was immediately engaging his attention ; but, the imperative and penetrating steady stare, which he darted on the persons he was conversing with, was evidently the result of a fixed principle, and done with the view of intimidating, and of put ting them out of countenance : thereby gaining time to himself, and creating a temporary ab sence and confusion in others, on the subject upon which they were interrogated. With"], [593, "175 MILAN. Madame de Stael, I can truly say, that \" I never beheld Buonaparte, conversed with him, or heard his name mentioned, without experienc ing a most singular emotion, that would almost paralize my recollection.\" Shortly after this, I had an opportunity of having my opinions, with regard to the charac ter of Buonaparte, confirmed by a long per sonal interview. I was introduced to him by the Duke di Serbelloni, in consequence of hav ing had two carriages stolen from the public repository, by one of his generals, O'Pigion, at the period when the French entered Mestre. As the Venetian states had not at that time been openly violated, except in these partial plunderings, I applied for their restitution ; and, through the medium of my friend the duke, I obtained an order from Buonaparte to that effect; though he well knew, that O'Pigion had already disposed of them, as he had done of many others, for the benefit of the frater nizing gentry, who, at that time, under the name of liberty, appropriated every thing they could lay their hands on to their own use. Nor did I ever find reason to depart from my first impression with regard to Buonaparte, during the many opportunities which I after-"], [594, "176 MILA N. wards had of seeing and conversing with this most extraordinary man. Like Jupiter himself, he appeared to hold the destinies of human nature in his own hands ; operating like a destructive thunder bolt on every thing connected with morality and religion, with justice and honour. Is it therefore to be wondered at, that his misfor tunes and his ultimate downfall, should have been unaccompanied by any real regret ; except ing from those individuals who had lost their short-lived authority, and their fragile impor tance, by his political extinction ? The first knowledge that Barras had of Buo naparte arose out of the success of the latter, when commanding the troops against the insur rection of the populace at Paris, on the 13th Vendemiaire, 4th of October 1795. His name had begun to be a little popular, from his con duct at the retaking of Toulon from the Eng lish in 1793 ; but his notoriety may be dated from the period of the former scene of blood ; and, notwithstanding his own activity, and the party he had at Paris, all of them Habiles chiens de ehasse, ardens oiseaux de proie,\" he could not save himself from the execra tion, which his cruel conduct on that bloody"], [595, "177 MILA N. occasion had produced ; and accordingly, on the 9th of Thermidor, he was dismissed the ar my. As he was entirely without a fortune, or the means of procuring one, Barras contrived to have him appointed one of the Committee, whose business it was to defend the Constitutionalists. Tuscany and Spain were the first to acknow ledge the French republic. Next Prussia, at Basle in Switzerland, in the house of Rocco San fermo; then the Venetian minister, negociated for the same object. Sweden followed ; and Venice, wisely and cautiously, received the French minister, as the then representative of the \" French government,\" without committing herself, by giving to him any distinctive appel lation. This prudent line of policy, which, for fourteen centuries had been acted on by the Ve netian republic, was soon discovered to be too worn-out and threadbare, to make head against the machinations of Buonaparte : and it has since been strongly affirmed, that if Austria and England had then consented to acknowledge the government existing in France, Italy would never have been invaded ; as the French govern ment was by no means inclined to, or in a situa tion for, offensive operations ; but were rather disposed to retain their troops as a necessary prop of their newly-adopted system, and to turn VOL. II. N"], [596, "178 MILAN their thoughts to their own domestic organi zation and commercial interests, instead of en gaging in external conquests. But England and Austria, in conjunction af terwards with Russia, refusing to make peace with the republic, and the French army on the Rhine, under General Moreau, having gained considerable advantages, the government at Paris, fearing a renewal of the disturbances of the 13th Vendemiaire, began to think seriously of liberating themselves from the tribunes, by a foreign war, as well as to find employment for the hordes of miscreants, that had fled from all parts of France, and had found ready refuge, and encouragement for the commission of every earthly crime, in that vortex of infamy, \" la bonne ville de Paris.\" The best way of accom plishing which, and of ridding the soil of France of this band of assassins, it was supposed would be, by enabling the cut-throats to satiate their rapacity for plunder in a foreign country. Many generals were applied to; but, not a soul of them could be prevailed upon to engage to pass the frontiers of France, from the ex hausted state of her finances, the wretched con dition of her credit, and the extreme difficulty of finding commissaries, who would engage to supply the army with absolute necessaries."], [597, "179 MILA N, Just at this period, Barras, whether from be ing glutted to satiety, or from having formed an attachment to some fresh object, was desirous of getting rid of Josephine Beauharnois ; whose husband, if report speak true, was guillotined by his directions, on the very day, or rather the very night, on which he solemnized his ac quaintance with the lady. She was accordingly proposed by Barras to Buonaparte ; and, upon condition that he would forthwith marry her, the command of the army which was about to invade Italy, was to be the reward of his com pliance. Josephine having a tolerable stock of the commodity which is said to \" make the mare to go,\" and Buonaparte and his numerous rela tives being poor even to distress, both the terms of the agreement were instantly complied with ; and the modern Hannibal took upon himself the command of an army, consisting of thirty thou sand sans-culottes, without uniform, without arms, without money, without provisions, with out carriages, without horses ! Nor was it until they had reached Milan, that the necessary materiel was supplied them. Buonaparte once paid his addresses to Ma demoiselle Clery, sister to the wife of his brother Joseph, and now the reigning queen of Sweden ; N 2"], [598, "180 MILAN. but he was strongly opposed in his intentions by his mother, Madame Letitia, to whose wishes he used to pay implicit obedience, untd he be came master of Italy ; when he ceased to accord any attention to the advice given him by any of his relatives. He had now begun to command, and would pay no obedience but to his own good will and pleasure. As soon as Buonaparte had reached the fron tiers of Savoy, he left the army, and, in company with his mentor Berthier, and Salicetti, his ad jutant-general of plunder, set off for Genoa, where he was sure of finding a number of par tizans, not only attached to him from revolu tionary principles, but from personal interest; as many of them had large capitals in the French funds, which had been reduced to the minimum of their nominal value ; but which he promised, if supported by them, to raise to par. And, a pretty par it was J for he soon despoiled them of the remainder of their property, and annihilated the political existence of Genoa; \u2014 in gratitude, no doubt, for their readiness to become, in com mon with the rest of Italy, the willing slaves of his \" liberty and equality.\" At Genoa, Buonaparte soon formed an ac quaintance with Emanuel Balbi, one of the"], [599, "181 M I L A N. richest merchants in that city ; who, in company with Emanuel Gnecco and Adamini, procured him the loan of two hundred thousand livres. This was the very first capital sum that Buo naparte had at his own disposal : and hence may be dated the ruin of Italy ; and, ultimately, his own destruction, from the. spur which it gave to his projects of unbounded ambition. At this critical juncture, General Depinois entered Milan with the ragged army of free booters, whose natural wants stimulated them to that species of courage which is commonly to be found in pirates. In their way thither from the frontiers of Piedmont, they made free with carriages, waggons, horses, and every thing they could lay their hands on, to the utter ruin of the country that had the misfortune of being cursed with such unwelcome visitors ; but these little necessary appendages to an army only served as whets to their insatiable appetites. Liberty, fraternity, and equality, were the articles which they dealt out by wholesale : that is to say, they fraternized with the wives and daughters of their hospitable hosts; they took the liberty to plunder them of their property ; and they placed every thing on a footing of equality, by reducing the inhabitants of every town and village they passed through, to a state of misery and wretch- N 3"], [600, "182 MILAN. edness hitherto unheard of.

While Buonaparte, Salicetti, and Berthier were thus busily employed in getting together the \" sinews of war\" at Genoa, Depinois took up his head-quarters at Milan, in the palace of Count d'Oppizoni. The lady of the house having invited him to dine with her at her own"], [601, "183 MILA N. table, observed to a friend who was present, that the general was so filthy in his person, and so dirty in his dress, and particularly in the ar ticle of linen, that she could not bear to sit at table with him. Her expression was, \" Guar date; ha una camisca come un farraio.\" How ever, Depinois had not been a week at Milan, before he had taken care to lay in a plentiful supply of wearing apparel, from the proceeds of the plunder of the churches, and private houses of the Milanese. The finest linen and cambric to be found in the shops of Milan were scarcely deemed good enough for the ruffianly marauder. When Moreau arrived from the Rhine, he was all astonishment at beholding the vast dif ference there was between the appearance of the army of Italy under Buonaparte, and the one which he himself commanded in Germany. The former resembled, he was accustomed to say, more the Hungarian body guard of the Empe ror of Germany, than the modest troops of a young republic. I have been assured by Fiorelli, Serrurier, Le Clerc, and others, that the state of destitution in which the French army was, previously to its setting foot in the garden of Europe, was the primum mobile of the prodigious activity which distinguished their marches over the Alps : suc- n 4"], [602, "184 MILAN. cess or inevitable destruction being the only alternatives that presented themselves to their view. In the facility with which they accom plished their object, and the neglect of the Austrians in not sending a sufficient force to Cover the Lombardian territory, and assist the Piedmontese in the narrow passes of the Alps, are to be found the real causes of the inveteracy of the Milanese against the Austrians ; since, if this precaution had been taken, it would have been physically impossible for the French army to have made any effectual resistance ; from their total want of the most common necessaries, and the debditated state of mind as well as of body, in which they then were. Unfortunately, how ever, they were allowed to pass on unmolested; the court of Turin having made a precipitate flight, without leaving any decided instructions for the conduct of the government which re mained behind. I happened to be on a visit at Genoa, when the transactions between Buonaparte and Ema nuel Balbi of which I have spoken took place. On the following carnival at Venice, Balbi re turned my visit; and, in the course of conver sation, he assured me, that he had been repaid all the money he had lent, by a bill upon a mer chant in England, and, to the best of my recol-"], [603, "185 MILA N lection, in London. Balbi, though he had a tolerably handsome gentlewoman for a wife, was then paying his court to the beautiful Ve netian, La Barbaria. As Balbi, though rather an old man, wished to keep up the appearance of bustle and business, he generally invited the French parties to this lady's habitation. The society of the handsome Brignola, mother to the present minister at Turin, was also much culti vated by Buonaparte, as well as that of a Signor Fravega, during his stay at Genoa. For cer tain secret services which she had performed, the Brignola was afterwards made dame d'hon neur to Josephine, to the no small annoyance of the Castrato Marchesi, then one of her amo rosi; a passion which seized him, after he had scandalously deserted his English chere amie, Mrs. Cosway, a lady of distinguished merit. The cause of the quarrel being made known to Buonaparte on his arrival at Milan, to give the devil his due, he certainly did every thing in his power to mortify the unsexed musician ; nay, he even went so far as to forbid the \u2022 race of castrati to appear on the public theatres, and to direct, that the parts allotted to them should henceforth be given to females ; which continues to be the case to the present day. Buonaparte has at least the merit of having put an end to"], [604, "186 MILA N. this disgraceful and disgusting manufactory of mutilated human beings When he was crowned King of Italy, the Empress Josephine wished much to hear Mar chesi sing. The gentleman of the doubtful gender was accordingly sent for ; but, as he at first refused to comply with the royal command, he was compelled by a military escort to obey the \" altissimo et augustissimo Imperatore;\" which titles were now at the head of all the decrees and public acts of the government. As soon as Buonaparte had got the two hun dred thousand livres, and had made a sufficient number of proselytes to the good cause of in surrection at Genoa and Venice, leaving Sali cetti behind him as his plenipotentiary and fac totum, he returned to Milan, and took up his head-quarters in the palace of the Duke Gal liaccio Serbelloni. This repectable nobleman, for many private reasons, had never been attached to the Aus trians. To save his country from destruction, he availed himself of the prerogative and privi lege which the Milanese had obtained, when they gave themselves up to the Austrians on their chasing the Spaniards from Milan ; and amongst those privileges was the one which I have already mentioned; namely, that they"], [605, "187 MILAN. should be allowed to deliver up the keys of their city, whenever an enemy should be within a certain distance of the capital, rather than submit to have it taken by storm. Serbelloni was one of the deputies sent, with others, on this melancholy mission. The above particulars were related to me by the Duke di Serbelloni himself, who was my particular friend, and with whom I became in timately acquainted, on my first visit to Milan, through the recommendation of the lamented Princess of Lamballe. I met the Duke at Paris, when he came there, by the order of Buona parte, as one of the seduced deputies, to offer him the consulship of Italy for life, shortly after he had caused himself to be elected Consul of France. The Duke di Serbelloni was a most excellent character, a nobleman of the old school, and a general benefactor of mankind. His heart was in the right place ; but he was a little weak headed, rather inclined to be credulous, and, of course, easily imposed on. He had gone too far to retract ; well knowing that Austria would never forgive the enthusiasm with which he, and the rest of the Italian deputies, had hailed the approach of the man, who so solemnly promised them liberty, and the emancipation of their"], [606, "188 MILA N. beloved country from the trammels of foreign interference. On Serbelloni's arrival at Paris, and going to the Tuilleries, Buonaparte embraced him cor dially, called him his \" caro amico ;\" told him he was his country's champion and liberator ; and directed him, on his return to Milan, to keep open house, to stir up and cultivate a party in his favour, as it was his intention to nomi nate him vice-consul of the Cisalpine republic. Whilst he was thus soliciting the favour and good offices of this popular nobleman, Buona parte had certainly no idea of causing himself to be made Emperor of France, or King of Italy. On the Duke's taking leave of me at Paris, previously to his return to Milan, he said, \" I know not the reason, but, somehow or other, it runs in my head, that if you do not shortly pay us a visit to Milan, we shall never see each other again ;\" adding, jocosely, to my husband, \" If you won't come for my sake, at least come and see your old sweetheart the Duchess.\" However, after he had expended considerable sums, agreeably to Buonaparte's directions, and while all Lombardy was rejoicing at the prospect of the worthy duke's elevation to the vice consul ship, the Corsican thought proper to nominate Count Melzi to the high situation. Whether"], [607, "189 MILAN. from poison, from grief, or from remorse, poor Serbelloni died shortly after the above appoint ment took place, to the great grief of a nume rous family by whom he was beloved, of the poor to whom he was a generous benefactor, and of his friends by whom he was sincerely and justly esteemed. Though the Milanese had been constantly taxed by the Austrians, even in time of peace, for the maintenance of a standing army of twenty-four thousand men, when the French arrived amongst them, there were not within its walls above eight thousand troops. To this scandalous neglect is mainly to be attributed the disaffection of the Milanese towards the Austrian government, and the strong revolu tionary party which existed, and who were greatly and naturally incensed, at beholding themselves left thus unprepared for the long talked of invasion of their territories by the French. On his arrival, Buonaparte found the gates of Milan not merely open to receive him and his myrmidons, but taken off their hinges \u2014 never more to be closed against an enemy ! And here he remained for a considerable time, with the whole Ajaccian brood. The mother Letitia; the sisters, Paulina, Eliza, Caroline;"], [608, "190 MILAN the worthy uncle Fesch ; and the brothers Jo seph, Lucien, Louis, all established themselves in Milan ; together with General Le Brun, the generous, but duped cher ami of the beautiful Paulina Buonaparte, the present Princess Borg hese ; Le Clerc, Berthier, Bernadotte, Murat, and many others. All the engines of democracy were set in motion, and every man and woman applied to, that was likely to become instrumental to his revolutionary projects. Among others, the beautiful Ruga, the elegant Lamberti, once the chere amie of the Grand Duke Leopold, the Sopranzi Visconti, and many others were now to become the pot-companions of Madame Josephine ; and the latter lady afterwards be came the awowed mistress of Berthier. The place fixed on for the conciliabulum of Berthier and Visconti, of Lecchi and Ruga, of Paulina Buonaparte and Le Brun, of the sister of Lecchi and Murat, was, for the good of human nature as well as of the fine arts, the house of the celebrated painter, Appiani ; where, too, \"La Madre Letizia\" condescendingly stood god mother to one of his daughters, who now bears the christian name of the good old lady. To the honour of the new democratical Cisalpine Republic, I should here state, that all"], [609, "191 MILA N. the official decrees run in these terms : \" La Madre Republica di Francia ordina, e com manda la figlia Republica Cisalpina,\" and so forth. What an honour for this newly-created puppet-show government to be \" ordered \" and V commanded \" by the mighty French nation ! At that time, the young Eugene Beauharnois, the son of Josephine, was aid-de-camp to Ge neral Le Brun. Here, too, was planned the loudly vaunted battle of Lodi, whose much talked of bridge was passed, not by force of arms or by military bravery, but in consequence of the artful ma n\u0153uvres resorted to by the wily Corsican, to rouse the Italians to a pitch of enthusiastic madness in the supposed cause of indepen dence. Buonaparte would often exclaim, \" ora e venuta la regenerazione dell' Italia, e degli Italiani : liberta, independenza, e egualianza !\" These few fatal words electrified the people of Italy, and effected more for the invading gene ral, than he ever effected for himself, or than all his soldiers and cannon balls accomplished for him. This new inflammable matter burned, like another Etna, in the bosom of every Italian. Liberty, after two thousand years of slavery ! This was the acido carbonico ; this was the true gas, that made them soar in an element"], [610, "192 MILA N above human conception : or, more properly speaking, this was the hot-bed and nursery of all the exploits of the Corsican adventurer. The syren sounds of\" liberty, independence, and equality,\" that were now vibrated from one end of Italy to the other, were the all seductive weapons which bound them to his future ope rations, and which finally rivetted their fetters ; as will presently be evident to every unbiassed and honourable mind. The way in which Buonaparte contrived to raise the edifice of his greatness was by first working on the minds of that class which, in all nations, are most easily seduced to rebel against their lawful governments. This once accomplished, he soon made himself master of their destinies. His next step was to induce them to send deputies, demanding of him their independence. By this crafty mode of pro ceeding, every city and province were promised that they should be guaranteed by him in their maniacal projects, in virtue of his undoubted right to protect them. Ridiculous as this plan may appear, it nevertheless completely an swered his purpose. He affected modestly to accede to every thing that was proposed to him. Never was there a mortal who so completely masked his real character, as Buonaparte did"], [611, "193 MILA N. upon these occasions; though he took especial care to do nothing that could, in the least de gree, militate against his own schemes of ag grandizement. It is an old saying, that \" love is blind ;\" and assuredly the love of liberty had at that time blinded the poor Italians most completely ! As soon as Buonaparte returned to Milan, he set about procuring the names of all the leading men in Italy, who were at all likely to further his revolutionary projects. In most of the cities and principal towns, he had soon contrived to station his apostles, who were ready to prepare the way for the introduction of his regenerated system ; and he took especial care to select his victims from among the higher classes, and to choose men who, from motives of ambition or of disappointment, and not at all aware of the frightful engine that was preparing for the destruction of their country \u2014 and under the weight of which they were themselves about to be crushed \u2014 unguardedly swallowed the gilded pill, and entered, bond fide, into all his infernal projects. As these individuals were, in general, amongst the most distinguished for their wealth and cha racter, they were anxously looked up to by their inferiors and dependants, and their movements. vol. 11. o"], [612, "194 M I L A N. served as signals for the seduced and misguided multitude. I shall here present my reader with the names of a few of them. At Milan, there was the Duke di Serbelloni and his brother, Melzi, Belgioso, Moscati, Caluzi, Eluosi, Litta, Triculzi, Annoni, the general Pino, Oppizzoni, Cicopieri, and others of equal respectability. At Brescia, there were the general Lecchi, his brother, and his sister's husband, Martinengo, Tosi, and Gambaruce ; at Crema, Gambazocca, Cavalli, General Ga limberti, and Tadini : and at Turin, Breme and Satirano. At Genoa there were Brentano, the Brignola, Fravega, Doria, Emanuel Balbi, Gnecco, Adamini, Durazzo, and Guistinan : at Bologna, Caprara, Carbonesi, Aldini, Pepoli, and Ricci ; and at Vicenza, Anghisola, Tiene, Barbaran, Walmarano, Tressino, and many others. At Padua, there were Gaetano Onesti, Zigno, Ferro, San-fermo, Battaja, Zen : at Modena, Mullazani, Paulluci, Arrigoni : at Ferrara, Cicognara and Rangoni : at Rome, Borghese, Aldobrandini, Braschi, Justinan, Bonelli, Santa Crocie : and at Venice, Alvise Mocenigo, Alvise Pisani, Nicoletto Cornaro and his son, Delfin, the Tron, Widiman father and son, the Abbate Colalto, Barzoni, Contarini, Bragadin, Soranza, Fontana, Gradenigo, Qui-"], [613, "195 MILA N. rini the brother of Madame Benzona, with Labbia and many others. To this long and sad list, may be added those classes which are ever ripe for a change in the established government ; namely, the poor who have nothing to lose, and the idle and turbulent, who were liberally rewarded for their endea vours to propagate and establish a system so favourable to their native love of robbery. The standing maxim amongst these regenerators of their country was, \" liberty to plunder the rich, and to put them on a level with the lowest and most miserable classes, by a division of their property.\" I do not hereby wish to insinuate, that there were not, in the several governments of Italy, abuses that called loudly for reform ; but that reform was not to be effected by the means resorted to by \" I Romani in Greca,\" or by the French in Italy. I assert, and I do it fear lessly, that your aristocratical reformers who have acted upon democratical principles, have uniformly fallen the victims of their own mis guided policy, wherever they have set them selves up in opposition to their own order. The contributions of men and of cattle, of money and of provisions, of statues, of gems, and of pictures, that were levied by Buonaparte o 2"], [614, "196 MILA N. in Italy beyond all calculation. \" Live and let live \" was assuredly his maxim, as far as regarded those who acted under him. Every one of his generals, without distinction, was suffered to levy these contributions ; and it is generally believed, that he had always a stipu lated share of the booty. Augereau, Massena, and Lecchi were the very Attilas and Theodo rics of the modern French regenerators of the poor, suffering Italians. Massena, wherever he had any command, plundered in the most un merciful manner. A report of his cruel exac tions being made to Buonaparte, he answered, \" if I had two Massenas, I would hang one of them by way of example to the other ; but as I have only one, all I can do is to order the restitution of the property ;\" and accordingly, one of his aid-de-camps was despatched to desire that the plundered effects might be sent to head quarters. \" Is this all that you have to communicate ?\" said Massena, \" then tell Buo naparte, that if he ever talks to me about send ing the plunder to head-quarters, I'll take care he shall soon move those quarters. The trum pet is now sounding, and I am called elsewhere ; inform the general, that after the battle, we will settle accounts, and then we shall see who has plundered most.\" Any other man but"], [615, "197 M I L A N. Massena would have paid for these expressions with his life ; but, as the Corsican truly observed, he had only one Massena in his army, and that one was too useful an instrument to be sacrificed at that moment. It is however well known, that he afterwards made him disgorge a considerable part of his plunder ; \u2014 though it certainly never found its way back to the pockets of the right full owners !

I shall here introduce a few domestic anec dotes of some of the leading branches of the new imperial dynasty. To begin with the o 3"], [616, "198 MILAN. parent trunk. Madame Letitia Fesch, the wife of Charles Buonaparte, and the mother of \" Napo leon the Great,\" was at one time considered the most beautiful woman in all Corsica. When Count Marbceuf, the governor of that island, first became a candidate for the favours of this lady, she was the humble wife of a poor half starved attorney living at Ajaccio, a deserted spot in this more than demi-savage island. A friend of mine, who, while the British army was in Cor sica, supplied it with bread, has assured me, that little Jerome, who was afterwards made King of Westphalia, was then a poor miller's boy, and used to carry the flour in sacks to the different depots of provisions. The same gentleman like wise declared to me, that Eliza Buonaparte, the late Grand Duchess of Lucca Piombino, was the keeper of a billiard table ; which she attended to in person, and where she got acquainted with the British officer, by whom she afterwards had a child. When Madame Letitia first came to Milan, she was accompanied thither by her daughter Paulina, afterwards the princess Borghese, who, from her beauty and her various accomplish ments, soon attracted, amongst others, the at tention of General Le Brun. Whether or not"], [617, "199 M I L A N. it was for value received, it is impossible for me to say ; but, from the extraordinary sums he lavished upon her, he was soon obliged to quit the army, and even Milan itself. Through the industrions man\u0153uvres of her mother, she shortly afterwards married General Le Clerc ; which marriage was kept at the pa lace of the Duke di Serbelloni, and at which, as I have already mentioned, I was myself present. So notorious was the avarice of Madame Le titia, that it soon became the subject of general conversation at Milan. It was even asserted that she cultivated an acquaintance with the family of the celebrated painter, Andrea Appiani, from motives of the most refined eco nomy, and that she might have her own por trait and those of her family, painted at the price of a grazia \u2014 a coin with which it was very common for the good lady to reward the labours of the several artists she employed ! Letitia condescended to stand god-mother to one of Appiani' s daughters, and the child was even permitted to have the amazing honour of being named after the mother of a whole brood of forth-coming sovereigns \u2014 an honour which, of course, more than compensated the painter, for any expence he might have been at, in co- o 4"], [618, "200 MILA N. lours, brushes, canvas, and carved frames; oi\" for any extraordinary pains which he might have taken, to hand down to an admiring poste rity, the lineaments of a lady, who had been so great a benefactress of the world ! I must, however, do one piece of justice to Madame Letitia. On her being informed of the arrest of the unfortunate Duke d'Erighien, she flew to her son Lucien, and begged of him to accompany her to the Tuilleries. When ar rived there, she made use of all the authority over the First Consul, which a mother might be supposed to possess. She pointed out to him the danger to himself of committing so foul, and at the same time so useless, a crime, upon the person of a prince, who was so highly esteemed by all France. Finding that all her intreaties only strengthened her son's determination to order the immediate execution of his bloody purpose, she threw herself on her knees before him, and implored mercy for the unfortunate prince. Not being able to free his hands from her powerful grasp, Napoleon actually spurned his mother from him ; and Lucien, in endeavour ing to stop the progress of any further violence, would have been struck also, had he not warded off the kick, by giving the aggressor a tremen dous blow between his mouth and nose, which"], [619, "MILA N. 201 levelled the little man, as well as his mother, with the ground. The noise occasioned by the scuffle brought Josephine into the apartment, who assisted in wiping away the blood from her husband's face. But, though in great pain from the violence of the blow, Buonaparte had scarcely been seated, before he exclaimed, \" I'll make all my bro thers and sisters princes and princesses, except you, you vile wretch !\" The above circum stance, singular as it may appear to those who are unacquainted with the family, may be relied on as a fact; and it most probably was the ori ginal cause of Napoleon's treating Lucien with such marked indifference ; for he was the only one of his relations, who dared to reproach him with misrule, and an abuse ofthe authority which he had arrogated to himself. In a pecuniary point of view, however, it was not in the power of Napoleon to injure him ; for, while he was ambassador in Spain, Lucien, from the personal interest which he had in all the vessels furnished with letters of marque, that sailed from the different ports, contrived to have the prizes taken by those vessels adjudged in his favour ; so that, from the immense sums which he accumu lated in this way, and from the millions of livres which he received as his reward for signing the treaty of peace between Spain, Portugal, and"], [620, "202 MILA N. France, the modest Lucien had pretty well feathered his nest. Madame Letitia was so parsimonious, that she would seldom or ever dine at her own house, and never failed, when at Salicetti's, to order to be sent home to her what might be left at table, giving by way of excuse for so doing, that her own cook was very unskilful in these matters, and could not hit her palate. On the day when she had no invitation abroad, she would bargain with her own maitre d'hotel, and purchase of him what he might happen to have in the house at half price. She never paid a visit to any of her imperial children without bringing some thing away with her. She would caution them to take care and lay by something against a rainy day ; \" Pensatevi figlii miei,\" she would say, \" non si sa cosa arrivera domani\" \u2014 Reflect, my children; we do not know what may happen tomorrow.\" The poor Pucelle d'Orleans was put to death for witchcraft ; but the good pro phet, Letitia, has been suffered to console herself quietly at Rome, for the upset of her imperial house, with the spoils which her frugality and parsimony had enabled her to save out of the wreck of revolutionized Europe.* * Dr. O'Meara, (who, by the bye, is said to be partial to old gentlewomen) informs us, in his most veracious \" Voice from St. Helena,\" that, in 1819, this old lady's thoughts were"], [621, "203 MILAN Josephine Teacher Beauharnois, previously to her marriage with the great Napoleon, had been the mistress of Tallien, Barras, Talma, and, if rumour be correct, of many others. Her person was handsome, and her manners were graceful, fascinating, and elegant. When she first came to Milan, as the wife of the young general, her chief companions consisted of the very lie du peuple ; amongst them were the Sopranzi Vis conti, who shortly after became the mistress of Berthier, Prince of Neuchatel ; Lamberti, the ex-mistress of Leopold, the Grand Duke of Tus cany, together with Castelbarca, and Tanzi, \u2014 anciennement belle, mais a present un peu passee. The other ladies with whom Josephine asso ciated at that time were all of the same stamp ; and not a little did they contribute to the ex pensive democratical entertainments given to Madame Buonaparte, and her train of Italian regenerators, out of the contributions which they levied from the numerous votaries, at the shrines of their beauty. Nothing could well equal the enthusiasm in \" the good cause,\" with which these demireps contrived to animate the entirely \" divided bdween God and her son\" .' Verily, Mrs. Cole, thy piety was nothing, in comparison with that of la madre Letizia!"], [622, "204 MILAN gonzi, or dupes ofthe day. Madame Josephine was the goddess, at whose altar every one paid their devotions, and every where was she hailed as the double of the youthful Italian regenerator. Not a sound escaped the lips of these fraternals, that did not vibrate from one end of Italy to the other. \" Liberty and equa lity ! freedom and independence !\" were words, not only in the mouths of all, but even chalked over the door of every habitation. All, how ever, ended in the divide et impera ! Montaigne says, that, \" if there be a God, he must be just.\" The end of Buonaparte must have convinced the world that there is a God ; and that that God is a lover of justice ! Up to the period of the battle of Lodi, the above spirit-stirring words were constantly at the tongue's end ofthe credulous and abused people of Italy. Fetes of every description were given on the occasion ; and, at one of them which took place when the delirium was at its height, Josephine was mightily taken with a female art ist, who performed admirably on the violin; a Madame Paravicini, one ofthe numerous indivi duals whose professional abilities were put into a state of requisition, for the amusement of this all powerful regeneratrice. Josephine was amaz ingly delighted with this lady's performance, es-"], [623, "MILA N. 205 pecially as she enjoyed it gratis, and gave her an invitation, in general terms. Madame Paravicini, having recently married, against the consent of her relatives, a young man of family, not overburthened with riches, and being, in consequence thereof, wholly dependant on her talents for a subsistence, cultivated the patronage of Josephine, in pre ference to her own interest ; conceiving that her popularity as an artist who had just made her debut in public, would be greatly promoted, by the powerful countenance and protection of this Mec\u00e6nas in petticoats. Not aware of a fact which then began to be generally known ; namely, that Josephine's real name was \" Take all and pay none,\" and that she had learned how to conjugate the verb to have, but not the verb to give, Madame Paravi cini continued to perform for her every day, cnBng her residence at Milan; where there was a continued round of parties. And, that every thing might be en regie, she had also the high honour of giving lessons on the violin, two hours in the day, to Josephine's son, Eugene Beauhar nois, who was at that time aid-de-camp to ge neral Le Brun, and to whom she lent a most valuable instrument, made by Steiner. When the great lady was about to leave Mi-"], [624, "206 MILA N. Ian, she enticed, by her flattering promises, this poor young artiste to follow her to Paris, and paid her for her past trouble, with a \" Comme vous etes charmante ! Je vous remercie infini ment: adieu, ma belle! au revoir, ma chere, a Paris.\" Deceived by her apparently affable conduct, both husband and wife were credulous enough to follow their liberal patroness to the French metropolis. On Madame Paravicini's arrival there, being then far advanced in her first preg nancy, she was taken dangerously ill, frcm the fa tigue ofthe long journey, and had no other means of subsistence, but what might be derived from the sale of their wearing apparel. Having at last disposed of every thing, and being in a strange country and totally destitute of the ne cessaries of life, she bethought herself that she would write to Josephine, to solicit of her at least the payment of the sum due for the violin which she had lent her son to learn on. The instrument was worth from eighty to a hundred louis d'or ; to which was to be added the sum due for the lessons she had given to young Beauharnois. However, to this just application she received for answer, that \" Madame Jose phine was astonished she should be called on for the payment of a violin, which she imagined"], [625, "M I L A N. 207 had been sent to her son as a present ; that she knew nothing respecting the instrument, or the lessons given to Eugene; and desired therefore that she might be troubled no further on the subject.\" Driven almost to desperation by the above unfeeling answer, Madame Paravicini was under the cruel necessity of applying to the Italians then resident at Paris ; who kindly made up amongst them a subscription for her ; not pro claiming their good deed, pro bono publico, on \" the house tops,\" as is the case in some countries, and by which the remedy is often rendered as painful to the wounded feelings of the patient, as was the disease itself; but col lecting the needful together quietly, from a few real friends of suffering humanity. With the money thus obtained, the lady was enabled to redeem her apparel, and to return to Milan. I never take up an English newspaper, and read \" A Case of Distress,\" with the name of this or that Royal Duke, ostentatiously stuck at the head ofthe list of subscribers, \u2014 but who, nine times out of ten, perhaps, never actually pay down the money affixed to their names, \u2014 without thinking of the real charity of her coun trymen to poor Madame Paravicini, and without callino- to m\\ recollection, the advice ofthe great"], [626, "208 MILAN. founder ofthe Christian religion \u2014 \" When thou givest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth !\" But, in the cases I have alluded to, not only the \" left hand\" is made acquainted with the gift, but every man, woman, and child, who is capable of reading a newspa per! But\u2014 verbum sat sapienti. So much for Madame Josephine's want, not merely of generosity, but of common honesty. This circumstance took place before she had been dubbed an Empress. The whole particu lars of her dishonourable conduct were related to me at Dresden, in the year 1803, by both the Paravicinis, after I had been dining with them at the house of M. Lavallette, who was then the French minister at the court of the present king of Saxony, and who afterwards was liberated from a prison at Paris, through the gallant ex ertions of Sir Robert Wilson, an English general and Member of Parliament. That Buonaparte had formed the intention of repudiating Josephine, long before he married Maria Louisa is certain : for when at Verona, he was accustomed to enquire who were the richest noble young ladies ; and, having seen two whom he liked, he proposed to Berthier, that if he would take one of them, he had no objection to take the other himself. Berthier"], [627, "209 MILAN was, however, too much attached to the Vis conti, a low Italian woman whom Buonaparte detested, to think of marrying ; and his de parture for Campo Formio put an end to the speculation. So little of a democrat was Buonaparte, that he could not bear to associate with low women, except for the moment. He was greatly dis pleased with Lecchi, for forming an attachment to the Ruga ; nor was he satisfied with the mar riage of General Pino with the dancer Pellesina, though she brought him an ample dower, and had been previously married to the Marquis Calderara. By Pino's marriage, too, Buonaparte saved several thousand livres ; as he had twice paid the general's debts. It has been said, that Buonaparte was one of the innumerable innamorati of Madame Gras sini; but the fact has never been established, nor was he ever observed to be more attentive to her, than he was to the other opera singers. Most probably the signora was herself the inventor of the rumour, that she might have greater influ ence with a certain Royal Duke, a member of numberless philanthropic societies, and a pro digious collector of Bibles, who afterwards be came the protector of Mrs. Billington. Just as if a woman, who had been as common as a VOL. II. P"], [628, "210 MILAN. country whipping-post, could raise her reputation on the fame of one man more than on that of another ! She afterwards married a young man of the name of Ragona, whom she had never seen but once; and, as she \"longed,\" like Lucy in the Beggar's Opera, \" to be made an honest woman of,\" she gave him a considerable sum of money. In a short week after the marriage, the bride set off for Paris, to follow her old trade ; leaving Ra gona at Bologna, the place of his birth, there to enjoy the fortune which he had so easily and so honourably obtained ! With respect to Buonaparte, it is evident that ambition and thirst of conquest was the rul ing passion, which, \" Like Aaron's serpent, swallowed up the rest;\" and, to this may be mainly attributed the fact, that he never discovered a propensity to those other vices which are so common to all our . great heroes. Buonaparte was subject to violent hysterical fits during the night; and, when in that state, he was remarkably communicative. On this ac count, the prudent Josephine was extremely careful that he should form no connexion that might entice him from her bed. To effect her purpose, she expended considerable sums on"], [629, "MILA N. 211 spies of all descriptions, whose duty it was to acquaint her if any such connexions existed ; since he might, when the fit was on him, di vulge to them certain state secrets. In this pre cautionary step she was mainly assisted by her factotum Fouche, and his innumerable runners. Many a female was banished from Paris on mere suspicion; and Grassini would never have been allowed to remain in that capital, or to have sung at Josephine's private concerts, had the great lady for a moment suspected, that her husband had the smallest attachment to the syren. When Josephine was at Milan, the Count Sommaglia said to her, \". I hear that our Gras sini is a mighty favourite with the Emperor.\" \" Yes,\" said she, \" the ridiculous vanity of the creature amuses us amazingly : she sometimes sings a duet with Crescentini, when they happen to be good friends ; but, since she has been made by the Emperor directress of the Italian opera, there is more intriguing going on amongst these gentry than there is at court : in the midst of a serious\" conversation she wdl break out into a horse laugh, throw herself on a sofa, and, fancying herself Semiramis on the throne of Nineveh, will burst out 'in great style with, ' Son Regina e son amata !\"' P 2"], [630, "212 MILA N.

She went round to each of them, entreated their affections for her \" dear Eugene,\" as she was accustomed to call him, and expressed a hope, that if he might happen not to do all that the Milanese should expect of him, they would kindly consider his youth, and his dependant situation. \" His heart,\" she would say, \" was good, and she therefore trusted they would take the will for the deed, and assist him with their kind counsels; of which, from his inexperience, he would so much stand in need.\" She was certainly most passionately attached to her son, and could never take leave of him, but with evi dent marks of the bitterest anguish."], [631, "213 CHAPTER XVIII.

The overthrow of the Venetian republic, the particulars of which I have given in my former volume, was soon followed by that of the rest of Italy. Ferrara, Bologna, Tuscany, Parma, Modena, Rome and Naples, were stripped of all the chef-d'\u0153uvres of art; which were sent on their travels, until they should arrive at the con queror's \" good city of Paris.\" Buonaparte now directed his attention towards the Roman States and his Holiness the Pope, with a view of avenging the insult of the Bas villiana ; but he was stopped in his career by the p3"], [632, "214 MILA N. famous peace of Tolentino. The once mistress of the world was plundered of her most valuable monuments of antiquity, and Pius the Sixth was soon afterwards sent prisoner to France. Na ples, as my readers will have already seen, had been previously revolutionized, and had taken the name of the Republic of Parthenope ; in conse quence of which, Buonaparte returned to Ve rona, and from thence to Milan. I do not recollect, that the great man ever visited Rome or Naples, or even Florence. The only people in Italy, who made any vigorous opposition to the revolutionary army, were the people of Arezzo, in Tuscany, already noticed. All Italy was, by this time, divided into dif ferent republics, kept in subjection by French troops, governed by French magistrates, and following French fashions. The air only, the soil, and the climate \u2014 things which the mighty Buonaparte could not change \u2014 remained in statu quo, unpolluted by the Gallic disease \u2014 though, even the very earth had been impoverished, by the numerous different armies that had entered that unfortunate country : \u2014 for revolutionists and imperialists alike brought with them nothing but desolation and destruction ! The different invasions of Italy, by the troops of Russia and Austria, took place chiefly while"], [633, "215 MILA N. Buonaparte was engaged on his notable expe dition to Egypt. The Russians soon becoming dissatisfied with the conduct of the Archduke Charles, withdrew their army, and left Austria in full possession of the whole of that country : but, the vacillating manner in which the Aus trian cabinet conducted itself towards the Ita lians, was by no means calculated to promote their influence in that country. Every thing done by them was \"provisional.\" In their civil and military operations, there was no solid gua rantee for the people ; who were, in consequence, kept in a state of unceasing perplexity and irri tation. The most unjustifiable arrests took place of many Venetians, who were not subjects of Austria when the crime imputed to them had taken place; namely, that of having embraced the democratical government, after the aristo cratical one had abdicated; and who were, therefore, certainly not amenable to the juris diction of Austria. Notwithstanding which, chained together like malefactors, they were sent, as galley-slaves, to the different fortresses in Hungary. This conduct of Austria towards her newly purchased subjects, was surely most harsh and unjustifiable, and little calculated to make her yoke popular with the people of Italy. Besides, p 4"], [634, "216 MILAN. the general confusion that took place in the or ganization of the government \u2014 which, as I have said, was only a provisional one, \u2014 caused such a stagnation in every department, as was of itself calculated to promote universal dissatisfaction. But, added to this, the discharging of nearly all the persons before employed in the public offices, the persecution of others merely for their opinions, the shutting up of the free masons' clubs and the declaring their members incapable of holding any public situation \u2014 all these things naturally created an unconquerable disgust in the minds of the people against the Austrian government. The same impolitic persecutions also exaspe rated their former subjects, the Milanese, against them. Being by this time habituated to the polite and insinuating manners of the French, they began to look upon the Germans as a na tion of uncouth intruders \u2014 not to bestow on them a harsher appellation ! Buonaparte had his emissaries established in all parts of Italy. When he was in Egypt, he was acquainted with every thing that was going on there, as well as in France. Was it, indeed, to be supposed, that a man who, from the moment of his entrance into Italy, had formed the design of appropriating"], [635, "MILAN 217 the sovereignty of that country to himself, and who was only waiting for the moment the most propitious to its accomplishment, had lost sight of so vast an object? Did he not, on his return to France from Italy, sound Barras upon the subject; telling him, that they had offered to make him Duke of Milan and King of Italy ; and adding, \" Mais je ne pense a rien de semblable dans aucun pays?\" And, did not Barras reply, \" Vous faites bien de n'y pas songer en France ; car si le Directoire vous envoyait demain au Temple, il n'y aurait pas quatre personnes qui s'y op poseraient?\" This spirited reply of his friend and protector convinced Buonaparte of the necessity of ab senting himself from France for a time, as the only means of avoiding the daily stabs which the Directory encouraged, and permitted to be pub lished, at his growing popularity ; as nothing was left him to execute, but the mad pro ject of invading this country. The conqueror of Italy had, indeed, no alternative but that, or the scarcely less ridiculous project, of subjugat ing India, through the medium of an expedition to Egypt \u2014 an enterprize, which, at the same time that it saved his own person, flattered the credulity and the vanity ofthe French. ."], [636, "218 MILA N. As a further proof of his boundless ambition, did not Buonaparte cause Madame de Stael to be banished for twelve years from Paris, because her father, M. Neckar, after the interview he had had with him on Mount St. Gothard \u2014 in the course of which interview the latter discovered his projects of aggrandizement \u2014 published a political work, putting the French upon their guard against the encroachments of Buonaparte, or of any other military chief, who might at tempt to violate their liberties, and restore those abuses, which, after so many sanguinary conflicts, they had succeeded in annihilating? That neither Buonaparte, nor any of his re lations and kindred, were ever republicans at heart, nor advocates for a democratical form of government, any further than as it could be rendered subservient to their long-stifled views of ambition, has been evinced by every succeed ing event ; since that form of government has, on every occasion, been laid aside, whenever it could be done without compromising their own personal safety : a fact this, which will be abundantly established in the course of the fol lowing pages. Indeed, long before this, Napoleon Buonaparte had caused himself to be appointed one of the Triumvirate, with Le Brun and Cambaceres ;"], [637, "219 MILA N. who were of the same service to him, as link boys are to pick-pockets ; the former, by keeping the royalists in the dark; the latter, by holding up \" le revers de la medaille.\" But, when he found he no longer stood in need of their arti ficial light, they were themselves extinguished, like the snuff of a candle, and pronounced mere noun-adjectives \u2014 the substantive Buonaparte having, ex-abrupto, declared himself Consul for life! - To shew the falsehood of Buonaparte's asser tion to Doctor O'Meara at Saint Helena, that he wished to be considered \" l'homme du peuple,\" and still further to prove, that neither himself, nor any of his family ever had a grain of democracy in their composition, I shall here insert a valuable document, which will prove to my readers, that, so far back as the year 1789, his brother Joseph was anxiously labour ing to prove himself descended from an ancient Italian family, and humbly supplicating the Grand Duke of Tuscany to bestow on him a knighthood of the order of San Steffano.

A brief, but, I think, an interesting detail of Buonaparte's conduct towards his Holiness, wdl"], [647, "229 MILAN have been found in a former chapter of the present volume. The next proof of Napoleon's attachment to royalty was in sending his brother Lucien am bassador to Spain, there to negotiate, at the price of twenty millions of livres, the erection of the short lived kingdom of Etruria, in favour of Charles the Fourth's son-in-law, the nephew of the Duke of Parma, whose territories had been previously violated and plundered. For which purpose, that imbecile puppet of a Duke, was now to be exhibited at Paris, by way of echantillon of Buonaparte's new kingly manu factory. On the first night of the prince and princess making their appearance at the French opera, they were assailed with the most dis gusting epithets ; such as \" vilain crapaud, est-tu venu ici pour faire la cour aux assassins de vos parens ?\" \" Partout nous vous chasse rons.\" \" En bas, en bas, avec ces f de princes !\" were the cries from all parts of the house. Buonaparte, however, took care not to shew his face at the opera that evening ; and the poor gingerbread king and queen of Etru ria were accompanied to their hotels, with the same, if not worse, language, from the mouths of the \" dames de la Halle ;\" and it was with the greatest difficulty that they reached their apart* Q 3"], [648, "230 MILAN ments, without that personal injury, which was alone prevented by the military in attendance upon them. It was also necessary to keep their departure a secret from the said Dames, who were busily preparing for them, d leurfacon, some additional proofs of their attachment. They left Paris in a private and precipitate way, and thereby escaped the honours laid up in store for them. But, having turned their backs on Paris, they were no longer in danger. All the leading persons attached to the old school of monarchy were now courted by Buo naparte, and flattered with the restoration of it ; and were even so far gulled as to be made to believe, that he actually intended to replace the Bourbons on the throne of their ancestors. The \" Moniteur, \" the official newspaper, was every day filled with fabricated articles, an nouncing Buonaparte's magnanimous intentions in this respect. The wife of the well-known Clery, the faithful domestic of the unfortunate Louis the Sixteenth, was dining with me one day, during the appearance of these rhodomon tades ; and, quite overjoyed, she shewed me a paper. \" There,\" said she, \" I am or dered to write to my husband ;\" who was in Germany with the Countess de Ldle, as she was then called, the wife of the present King"], [649, "231 MILA N. of France. This paper, was a sort of gua rantee from the police. She enclosed in her letter to her husband many of these articles from the Moniteur ; but a Madame Beaumont, a natural daughter of Louis the Fifteenth, and very much like him in person, who lived with her, was not so ready in her behalf. She had had an intimation given her of what had been going on between Buonaparte and the Prussian minister ; who had dispatched a well-known author and public character, now in England, on the famous mission to Warsaw, with propo sitions to induce Louis the Eighteenth to give up his pretensions to the throne of France, in favour of Buonaparte, and not expressions of a wish, on the part of the latter, to replace the former on the throne of his ancestors. The said propositions were, however, rejected with utter disdain. At this time, emissaries were dispatched all over Germany, for a purpose, if possible, of a still more heinous nature, and in the accomplishment of which the Corsican's mouchards were equally unsuccessful. The object of Buonaparte was the entrapment of the royal family of France, par ticularly the queen, in a manner similar to that which had led to the ever-execrable murder of the Duke D'Enghien \u2014 from the spilling of q 4"], [650, "232 MILAN whose blood sprung a grand dukedom. This atrocious deed, together with the sale of the Venetian states to Austria, for ever blackened the fame and blasted the laurels, that Buona parte had gained by his military achievements ; as they were both of them the most wanton acts of cruelty and injustice, that were ever resorted to by a man in possession of unlimited authority. The deception practised by Murat towards the unfortunate Duke d'Enghien, was justly punished by the fate which he afterwards met with \u2014 not to mention his numerous and horrible executions in Madrid, the bare recollection of which appals my senses, \" And make the conduits of my blood freeze up.\" And yet, there are Englishmen, and English women too, to be found, who whine over the end of this sanguinary monster ! Finding that he had failed in two of his grandes pensees ; namely, the assent to the abdi cation on the part of Lewis the Eighteenth, and the arrest ofthe French princes, Buonaparte now set all his engines at work, to play on the cre dulity of the people of Italy. He caused a report to be circulated, that, being of Italian origin, he might, probably, be induced to renounce the"], [651, "233 MILAN Consulship of France, and take upon him the glory, after so many centuries of degradation, of regenerating that fine country, from the borders of France to Sicily, by forming it into one grand kingdom ; and this report, being in accordance with the ruse which he had played off on my excellent friend, the poor deceived Duke di Serbelloni, stirred up the hopes of the people almost to madness. The enthusiasm which prevailed in the north, as well as in the south of Italy, shewed, that they were ad chil dren of the same soil ; though millions of them had never felt the influence of the heat of Vesuvius or of Etna. They were electrified at the bare thought of becoming one entire nation, after they had been, for centuries, groaning under the yoke of so many princes and sove reigns ; by whom, from motives of a political nature, arising out of their soil, their strength, and their desirable situation, they had been kept in a state of perpetual variance with each other ; and, in consequence of which, they have now amongst them, nearly as many dialects as there are cities ; though the nobility and men of let ters all speak good Italian. Engines, of every description, were put in motion, for the purpose of promulgating the mighty man's new projects. Pensions were"], [652, "234 MILA N. offered to one class, who were to be made Senators for life. The College of Electors were to be the sacred depository of the people's rights. The Senators were called the mono syllabic association : the College of Electors, the affirmative tribe. The lesson given to this notable body was, never to dispute among themselves, and only to answer as the bride does when the parson puts the wished-for question, \" Will you have this man to be your usband ?' ' The second order of these Orator Mums were directed to spare their lungs, and, by a sign of the head, like Mandarin figures, they were to bend themseves forward, in token of approbation of every individual whom Buo naparte might wish to have elected. For which good work, each member was to wear a cross of merit, and with it was to receive the very mo derate annual pension of thirty thousand franks ! As the wily Gloucester, when Buckingham had seduced the Mayor and Aldermen of Lon don to entreat the cruel hunch-back to take upon himself the sovereignty of the kingdom, craftily exclaimed, \" Alas, why should you heap these cares upon me ? I am unfit for state and majesty ; I do beseech you, take it not amiss ; I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you \" \u2014"], [653, "MILAN 235 so did the no less crafty Napoleon, when, poor man ! he was about to receive the heavy load of the imperial dignity, so much against his inclination, say, to those who intreated him thereto, \" Well, gentlemen, if you will have me take upon myself the immense charge of being the responsible head of the French go vernment, tye me down ! create a Senate to watch my proceedings !\" And, good heavens, what a Senate it was! Why, it was the very rump parliament of the renowned Praise-God-Barebones, who occupied themselves all day long in seeking the Lord, as earnestly as Cromwell, their master, occupied himself in seeking the Devil ! Certain it is, that Napoleon imitated the regicide hypocrite in all his operations ; except in his laudable economy of the public money ; for, to the no torious Fouche were intrusted millions, for the purpose of seducing the wretched inhabitants of the faubourgs of Paris, to assist in the erection of his usurped power. Titles, and pensions, and decorations, were also to be lavished on the army. Emoluments were to be bestowed on the literati, and on the civil matristrates. Even the restoration of the nuns and friars was held out, to induce all parties to combine together for their own des-"], [654, "236 MILAN truction. But, who could have supposed it possible, that he meditated the deception of the whole of them, and that even his son-in-law Eugene was not to be exempted from his du pery ? For, though he had already declared him his heir, he nevertheless, on the birth of his brother Lewis's son, as easily revoked his pro mise, in favour of the child, whose father, when King of Holland, from the same ambitious mo tives, fell under the weight of a mere French crown ; which crown, however, Louis after wards honourably renounced his claim to, rather than wound his own conscience, by injuring the interests of his subjects, to satisfy the ca price and the cruelty of his brother Napoleon. The city of Genoa was flattered with Napo leon's especial protection. Having discovered, that many of the ancient families of that city had been formerly allied to the Buonaparte family, he \" wdled, ordered, commanded, and insisted,\" that their government should forthwith be revolutionized : and, for giving them a pre tended free institution, he made them come down handsomely ; for, what between the ves sels which the English took from them by sea, and the plunderings of the French by land, the Genoese were reduced almost to a state of nudity. Having lost the ancient spirit of the"], [655, "237 MILAN Dorias, they accepted, with the bayonet at their throats, the short-lived, buffoon Ligurian republic. Having, like a skilful physician, a plaister for every sore, Buonaparte made the Genoese believe, that he would restore their navy to its pristine greatness ; that he would budd them new arsenals and docks for fresh fleets; and that he would render them, from their situation, the dread of the English, by furnishing them with a fleet which should cruize from Genoa up to Gibraltar. Nothing could flatter the vanity ofthe Genoese so much, as the idea of again be coming a respectable maritime power ; and, in nothing were Buonaparte's great abdities more conspicuous, than in the pains which he uni formly took to accomplish his end, by flattering the weak side of all those whom he had de termined to make his dupes and his slaves. But, all these man\u0153vres were necessary to the attainment of that imperial authority which now became the object of \" His daily longing, and his dream by night ;\" And, from the debased condition to which the people of Italy had been reduced, by a series of plunderings and dilapidations, can it be matter of surprise, that their minds should have"], [656, "238 MILAN. become debased ; that their feelings should have been deadened to their best interests ; and that they only looked forward to the readiest means of freeing themselves from a state of perpetual uncertainty, agitation, and convulsion ? And, such was the precise situation of Italy, when the project for the restoration of mo narchy began to be warmly embraced by all ranks of the people of that distressed country. That tranquillity, and that peace of mind, to which they had so long been strangers, but which Buonaparte now flattered them with the possession of, and which really had all the appearance of being within reach, lulled them into a luxuriant dream of coming prosperity ; whereby they were induced credulously to pro mote aU Buonaparte's projects of ambition, to their own future enslavement, as well as bit ter remorse, at having, at the expense of the political independence of their native land, reared the first steps of his tyrannical usurp ation. Napoleon's next grand operation was the bringing about the re-establishment of the Ca thode religion in Paris, at a period when it was almost dangerous for a citizen to be seen with a common-prayer book ; but, without the ac complishment of this object, never could he"], [657, "239 MILAN have succeeded in placing the imperial diadem on his head ; for, certain it is, that the intrigues of the French clergy had a considerable share in establishing him on the throne of the Bour bons, regardless of the rights of the legitimate heir ; though Lewis the Sixteenth had suffered on the scaffold in the support of their cause ! The better to secure the success of this pro ject, the same Archbishop of Aix, who had officiated at Rheims at the coronation of the unfortunate Lewis, was applied to. The pro found policy discoverable in these workings of the Corsican's brain is alone equalled by the effects which they produced. The ambassadors chosen on this occasion were Cambaceres and Le Brun ; the object of Napoleon being to destroy these two worthies in the estima tion both of the republicans and of the roy alists ; as it was equally so to ruin the said Archbishop in the universal opinion of all Europe. Like all his other plans, this too com pletely succeeded ; the parties consenting to become the dupes and the slaves of its wily projector. Now was arrived the time for proclaiming the concordat of his holiness the Pope. Ac cordingly, on the Easter Sunday following, Buo naparte went in state to the Metropolitan"], [658, "240 MILAN Church of Notre Dame, in one of the carriages belonging to the murdered King of France, drawn by six horses, accompanied by the Bi shops and by an army of thirty thousand men, there to reestablish the true Catholic faith, with all the \" pride, pomp, and circumstance \" of royalty, excepting in the article of liveries. He, however, insisted, that the servants of Cam baceres and Le Brun should be so habited, in suits of the richest description ; for the purpose of trying how far the Parisians were likely to relish the restoration of the old order of things ; to see whether or not he subjected himself to danger, or to ridicule ; and, if there should be any, that it might fall on the shoulders of the above right worthy couple, whom he longed to precipitate from the seat of government : for Napoleon, like his brother Turk, was unable to \" bear a rival near the throne.\" The experiment exceeded the cunning pro jector's most sanguine expectation ; and, to say the truth, the sight altogether was one of the most imposing scenes that was ever exhibited. Indeed, it beggars all description, and was cer tainly, of all Buonaparte's triumphal entries into Paris, the triumphal entry par excellence. No fewer than eighty thousand troops lined the streets of the city. The Mameluke soldiers,"], [659, "MILA N. 241 two and two, were seen leading a horse each, bedizened out in the richest Asiatic trappings, the saddles and saddle-cloths being covered with gold and precious stones. The whole, in short, having more the appearance of eastern pageantry, than a republican procession headed by its de mocratic first ruler. In a morning or two after this splendid pro cession, an article appeared in the official paper, the Moniteur, for the purpose of being circu lated throughout France. It began by stating, that \" it could not be denied, that Paris abound ed in persons possessing the most lively imagi nations ; that it had been strongly urged by such persons, how much it would be for the be nefit of France and of all Europe, and how greatly it would contribute to the establishment of universal tranquillity, if Buonaparte could but be induced to take upon himself the sovereign au thority, with a title suitable to the dignity of so renowned a nation. ' What do you think of king?' said one. ' O, no,' replied another, ' that's a name odious to the ears of Frenchmen.' ' Well,' said a third, \u00ab what think you of em peror ? I wish, with all my heart, that such a proposition was not death by the law !' ' O !' continued a fourth, \u00ab but our Buonaparte is too merciful and too generous to order its execution VOL. II.

' Be sides,' added a fifth, ' he was himself one of those who caused this decree to be issued ; and surely, as Charlemagne, in many instances, made and unmade lawrs at his discretion, the great Napoleon may be allowed the same pri vilege.' \" This trumped-up dialogue was immediately copied into all the other newspapers, and every succeeding day produced a fresh article in favour of monarchy. By devices like these did the son of the pettifogging attorney of Ajaccio, feel the pulse of the people of France, as to the degree of safety with which he might ascend the imperial ladder ! And, by such means did he \" Court that greatness which did overwhelm him !\""], [661, "243 CHAPTER XX. MILA N. THE BUONAPARTE FAMILY IN THE MILANESE TERRITORY.

Buonaparte's court now adopted a new style of addressing those around them. The family put on a sort of condescending benignity of man ners, and strove to recommend themselves by their charities, and their beneficent attentions to all ranks and classes ; until at last, nothing was actually talked of, but the astonishing mild ness of manners of the whole family, and the calm and implicit submission of Buonaparte himself to the will of the nation. r 2"], [662, "244 MILAN. And at this time it was, that he first ordered his secret emissaries to sound the Pope, as to his coronation ; for if he had found the old man un willing to take a journey to Paris, he had deter mined to have imitated the example of Charle magne, by going to Rome to be crowned ; though that was not precisely what he wished, as he was desirous of degrading and humbling the Pope, rather than of exalting him ; though he had chosen the conduct of the above sovereign as the model to go by. Having mentioned the great man who, in the year 800, became emperor of the west by right of conquest, I must here be allowed to relate a short anecdote. In the cathedral at Aix-la- Chapelle there is deposited, among other curio sities, a cameo of an onyx, about the size of a crown-piece, on which is a likeness, in basso relievo, of the son of Charlemagne, which really resembles Buonaparte, as much as if it had been intended for him, and far more than many ofthe portraits which he has himself sat for to Andrea Appiani, of Milan, who has painted him, at his own request, in all the striking stages of his career, and in all his imperial costumes. This cameo, when he was at Aix-la-Chapelle, Buona parte had copied ; and that copy was the identi cal medallion which he wore as the real likeness"], [663, "245 MILA N. of Charlemagne. But that, however, was not the fact, as the original is still to be seen in that chapel ; where the story was told to me by one of the keepers of the antiques. It must now be nearly a thousand years since it was executed. This cameo, on his arrival at Dresden, Buona parte shewed as the head of Charlemagne. He told the Saxons, that in the year 803, they had submitted to his likeness, exhibiting it from his neck, around which it was suspended by way of triumph ; as Charlemagne had behaved to wards the people of Saxony with excessive cruelty. This Buonaparte did, in revenge for the insults they had offered to Lavalette, who had been his democratical ambassador, and for the little respect they had paid him, previous to his being made emperor of France, and raising the Electorate into a kingdom. Ludovico Wide mann, a Venetian nobleman who died in Russia, assured me he was present when this conversa tion took place at Pilnitz, the country residence of the king of Saxony ; as did also Alvise Mo cenigo, who was charged with the mission to the Pope, the anecdote respecting the coro nation. But, to return to my narrative. Paris was now made to resound with the noble sacrifices, the warlike achievements, the political acquire- r 3"], [664, "246 MILAN. ments ofthe great Napoleon, and the pitch of glory to which he had elevated France, from the depth of anarchy in which he had found her, when he took the reins of government out of the feeble hands of the Directory. \" The con quest of Italy, the submission ofthe greatest part of Germany, the subjugation of the Swiss, the success in Egypt, the union of Holland, the ag grandizement of France, and the amazing ad vantages that would accrue to her from his having made the Rhine her boundaries, and thereby aggregated so many millions of subjects to that nation, added to the prosperous condition in which she then was \u2014 all these things demanded a striking act of gratitude on the part of the people, towards the godlike man who had been the cause of these numberless ad vantages.\" Such were the matters that were every day trumpetted forth in all the newspapers of Paris, and of which Lavalette was one of the prime propagators. The Palais Royal, too, had its orators. Speeches of the most fulsome description were delivered, and portions of them were indus triously circulated all over France, prior to the phosphoric matter being communicated from the north to the south of Italy. Added to this, by the flattering attentions which were now so"], [665, "247 MILAN. exuberantly lavished on the ministers of the dif ferent sovereigns, for their tame acquiescence in what was going on, all of them were credulously induced to assist in elevating to a throne, a man who was secretly planning the destruction and overthrow of every sovereign in Europe, to make way for his own mushroom family of kings and princes. In the mean time, the marriage took place be tween Hortensia Beauharnois and Napoleon's brother, Louis. A crown was to be the reward of their mutual compliance ; as it is well known that inclination, on either side, had nothing to do with their union, and that both the parties sacrificed themselves to state policy. Hortensia Beauharnois was the daughter of Josephine. She is a most accomplished and well-educated female : she sings and plays with much taste, feeling, and science ; has an excel lent heart, and a very considerable portion of good sense. She is kind, benevolent, charitable, unassuming, and affable to all who approach her ; aud, from her good understanding and natural disposition to kind actions in private life \u2014 united to the same good intentions on the part of her husband \u2014 they would have succeeded in making themselves respected and beloved in Holland, had they been inde- r 4"], [666, "248 MILAN. pendent sovereigns ; but it was impossible for theni to do those things for the good of their subjects, which the dictates of their hearts pointed out to them ; surrounded, as they were, by the spies of Napoleon, who reported to him every one of their actions ; until at last, finding that they were not suffered to do any thing for the benefit of the population entrusted to their charge, like faithful stewards, they yielded up the trust confided to them. They are both living retired, as the duke and duchess of St. Lu ; the former at Rome, the latter at Augs burgh, a city belonging to the king of Bavaria, whose daughter was married to Hortensia's brother, the worthy prince Eugene ; who, to the regret of all who knew him, has recently paid the debt of nature. As the duke of Wurtzburgh (late of Tuscany) did not think fit to leave his German dominions, to pay his court to the new king-maker at Paris, as all the rest had done before him, he was struck off the list ; and, in order to keep him in subjection, was told, that as Napoleon had de clared himself king of Italy, it would be dero gatory in him to give up any portion of it ; but that the duke might propose himself for the res toration of Poland, and that he should be sup-"], [667, "249 MILA N. ported in his claims to that kingdom ; which would be given to him as an indemnity for the loss of his German states. Tuscany was not mentioned, though (the king of Etruria being dead) the first of his new made queens was still seated on its throne. She, however, in a very short time, without any other reason but the will and pleasure of Napoleon, was dethroned ; and Murat, as a fit instrument for the deliberate execution of all sort of crimes, was commanded to execute the order, and to conduct her majesty and her son to Milan ; whence they proceeded to Spain. Previous to this event, Lucca had undergone the same fate as the other sister Republics, in be half of Napoleon's sister, Madame Eliza Bacci ochi, the wife ofthe ci-devant marker at a com mon billiard table. Madame Campan, formerly one of the at tendants on the unfortunate Marie-Antoinette, was now sent for to instruct the imperial family in prospectu, and the nobility, about to be cre ated, how to walk, how to look, how to speak in demi accents, so as scarcely to be understood, except by an inclination of the head, or the gra cious smile which was the characteristic of that amiable queen. Nay, even the unfortunate waddle of Louis the Sixteenth, was to be intro-"], [668, "250 MILA N. duced, as one of the appendages of former times, and the better to enable them to put on the airs of frivolous, light-headed courtiers. Courtesies, too, were industriously practised by the females ; and they were taught how they were to retire from the imperial court, without offending any of the newly-manufactured prin ces, by turning their imperial derrieres upon them on leaving the court. The chief of the court attendants were in structed how they were to listen to the persons presenting memorials to them, as well as to the more fortunate mortals who were to be presented to the potentissimo and augustissimo Napoleon Buonaparte \u2014 the titles which he assumed on being proclaimed emperor. While this drilling work was going on, some of the most ludicrous scenes that can possibly be imagined, were constantly taking place, be tween these washer-women duchesses in petto, and their equally dignified dukes of husbands. The ladies, when attired in their costly state dresses, forgetting they were not going to the wash-tub, would, every now and then, tuck up the sleeves of their gowns, the better to enable them to withdraw from the room backwards. Innumerable were the bruises they were doomed to suffer from stumbling over their trains ; and"], [669, "MILAN 251 many a \" sacre !\" did they rap out, before they became perfect in the court exercise. The Christian name, \" Napoleon,\" which had scarcely been heard of before, was now substituted instead of that of General Buona parte, by which he was only known, at least to the Parisians. The baptismals of the whole family were likewise used instead of their surnames. The females dropped the word \" citoyenne,\" for that of \" madame ;\" and no thing was now heard of but Madame Josephine, and Letitia, and Elise, and Stephanie ; and Mon sieur Joseph, Louis, Lucien, Jerome, Eugene ; and Mademoiselle Hortense, &c. &c. While these scenes were going on, the courts of Prussia, Bavaria, Baden, Wurtemburgh, Saxony, and Mecklenburgh-Strelitz, were all rewarded with large slices of territory, for the countenance they were affording to the new imperial system. Entirely new maps were ordered to be made out for the said territories. England was to be deprived of all her possessions in Germany. Hanover was to be given to Prussia, with Bre men ; and Saxony, Hesse-Cassel, Erfurth, and Weimer, were to be erected into a kingdom, and given to the Elector, together with the title* of king."], [670, "252 MILAN Bavaria was to have Salzburgh, Passau, Augsburg, Bayreuth and Anspach, and was also to be raised into a kingdom, with the Elector at its head. The Elector of Baden was to have Manheim and Hanau, and to be made a grand duke. Wurtemberg was to have Aschaffenburg, Constanz, Lindau, and other arrondissemens, to add to the dignity of a newly-manufactured kingdom. The Duke of Mecklenburgh-Schwerin was to have Stralsund, Lubeck, and Gluckstadt, and be made a grand duke. Spain was to have Portugal ; and the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Lucca and the Isle of Elba, with Massa and Carara. To his holiness the Pope was promised the restitution of the ancient Roman legations, Be nevento, Ponte Corvo, and some other places on the frontier, between Naples and Rome. All the German princes were obliged to enter into private engagements, to ally themselves with Napoleon, for the purpose of strengthening a German confederacy against Austria and Russia. It is said, that Russia, at that time, refused any aggrandizement in Poland, which could only be effected by the spoliation of Prussia or Austria. Turkey, the grand war horse of Catherine, was also held out ; but the immense force which the English kept up in the"], [671, "M I L A N. 253 Baltic, with the example of Denmark, and the feebleness of Sweden, were, it is said, the reasons why the Emperor of Russia would not, at that moment, accede to any of Napoleon's propositions ; though he afterwards united with him in all his continental schemes for the de struction of this country. Jerome Buonaparte was at that time in Ame rica, and married to the rich and beautiful Miss Pattison. A vessel was therefore imme diately dispatched, with directions for him to return to Europe and abandon his wife, as, by the German alliance, another had been fixed upon for him. In the meantime, Napoleon was proclaimed Emperor of France, and caused himself to be crowned King of Italy. There were now five imperial princes, and the like number of imperial princesses, to be provided for. This, however, could not be accomplished without the spolia tion of his former protegee, Spain : and, so completely did Buonaparte succeed in hoaxing the old queen of that country, that he gained her over to all his plans, on the mere rumour that it was his intention to restore monarchy in France ; fancying foolishly that he was labour ing for the restoration of the Bourbons. So totally duped were the King and the Prince of"], [672, "254 MILA N. Peace, that they sent an extraordinary courier from La Granca to the Tuilleries, to thank him for his confidence, and promising to assist him in his undertaking ; never suspecting, that he was all this time acting the hypocrite, or that it was his intention to play the first character in the farce he was getting up. Buonaparte flattered the Prince of Peace with the notion, that he intended to make him a so vereign prince, at the very moment that he was treacherously encouraging these sovereigns and their prime minister to leave their native coun try : for it is a notorious fact, that neither the king nor queen would ever have consented to leave Madrid, but for the influence which this minister exercised over these feeble-minded princes. On this account, Spain was the most difficult soil the Corsican had to work upon ; as she had tacitly consented to all his views. To accomplish his ends, therefore, it became necessary, by means of private emissaries, to sow the seeds of disaffection in the heart ofthe court, by stirring up the son against the father, and, vice versd, the mother against the son, the hus band against the wife, and the son against her favourite, the Prince of Peace ; until their pri vate quarrels had led to their public overthrow, and furnished him with a pretext for taking the"], [673, "MILA N. 255 whole of them prisoners, and for removing his brother Joseph from the throne of Naples and creating him King of Spain. Napoleon's next step was to give Naples to his sister Caroline and her husband Murat; and, from the depraved and tyrannical con duct of Joseph, during his short-lived reign, and the still more tyrannical conduct of his infamous minister, Salicetti, if Murat had avoided the violence to which he was com pelled by Napoleon to resort, he would have attached the people of Naples to his person and government ; as he had already done at Berg, and from which dukedom he was removed by Napoleon's jealousy, at finding that he was be coming too popular. Naples was always in tended for Lucien ; but, in consequence of his not consenting to divorce his wife, as Jerome had done, Napoleon determined to place Murat on the throne of that kingdom ; to the great dis gust and disappointment of Josephine, who wished her son Eugene to be appointed to the office, in order that he might be somewhat less dependent upon her husband : and, out of this arose the settled rancour that ever after subsist ed between Eugene and Murat ; for there is little doubt, that had the latter succeeded in his mad project of conquering the north of Italy, he would have shown the former no mercy."], [674, "256 MILA N. Holland, also, was now to change its system, and to be erected into a kingdom, with Louis Buonaparte, as I have before observed, at its head. Schimmelpenninck, who was at that time the governor, was by no means a fit person to fill the situation to which Napoleon had ap pointed him ; his principles being good, and he being a real lover of his native country, and anxious to cultivate a friendly commercial con nexion with England, he sacrificed his own pri vate interest, in endeavouring to promote that object. Augereau then commanded the French troops, and Simonville was the ambassador. I was acquainted with him in Italy, in the year 1792, when he was arrested by Pozzi, an agent of Austria, and sent prisoner to Mantua, where I had an opportunity of rendering him some essential services. In the year 1803, being with my husband and the late Count Zenobio, at the theatre at the Hague, Simonvdle recog nized me for an old acquaintance, but not with \" a new face ;\" for he behaved towards us with the utmost cordiality and politeness, and gave us a general invitation to his table, and to his box at the theatre. The whole three were re moved from Holland, to make room for men better suited to Napoleon's new order of things. Not only was the republic now to be upset, but"], [675, "257 MILA N. the possessors of princely prospects were to be deprived and plundered of their ancient here ditary dominions, for the benefit of a race of beggarly upstarts.

Jerome Buonaparte having, by this time, re turned from America, his marriage with the Princess of Wur tern burgh was solemnized, though much, it is said, against the inclination of the bridegroom ; but, such a charm is there in crowns and kingdoms, that they soon get the better of every virtuous scruple ! A beautiful wife, a beloved child, and a quiet conscience \u2014 what are they but feathers, when thrown into the scale of restless ambition ! The King of Prussia was next to be sacrificed, and to be made to disgorge, in a tenfold degree, the millions he had received from the French Directory, for his disgraceful neutrality, and his ready consent to the taking of Hanover frorn the English. In his turn, he was now to lose a considerable portion of his hereditary do mj^ons; for, more than the Great Frederick had gained during the Seven Years war, was, his unfortunate grand nephew made to. give up in"], [677, "259 M I L A N. the short space of seven days ! O ! if the old warrior could look up from his tomb, and see that Saxony which he had so cruelly insulted, possessed of his Brandenburgh dominions, how would his haughty spirit haunt the agents of this misguided policy ! But, forgetful of the \" hodie mild, eras tibi,\" Prussia fatally laughed at the downfall of Austria, and Austria laughed at the downfall of Prussia \u2014 until, by their own folly, both the one and the other had fairly been laughed out of house and home ! The kingdom of Westphalia was already des tined for the newly-married couple, and the battle of Jena decided the grand question in favour of the candidates. Hanover, Brunswick Lunenburg, Osnaburg, Bremen, Hesse-Cassel, and two-thirds ofthe hereditary Prussian domi nions, were now to be united, under the title of the kingdom of Westphalia. The word \" Land grave\" was to be dropped for the future ; and the Tom Thumb of a King, Jerome, was or dered to take up his residence in the ancient palace of the said prince at Cassel. The democratical government of France, which was in existence at the time of the pur chase of the King of Prussia's neutrality, not having then the money wherewith to make good the said purchase, actually sent to Berlin s 2"], [678, "260 M I L A N. the crown-jewels of the late King of France, as a pledge for the fulfilment of the stipulation. After the fatal defeat of the Duke of Brunswick, and the still more memorable battle of Jena, Buonaparte, on his arrival at Berlin, insisted on their being instantly given up to him ; together with the millions which the King of Prussia had received from the French Directory, for the aforesaid neutrality. His beautiful queen too, became the object of Buonaparte's rage and ab horrence; He calumniated and ridiculed her, for her virtuous affection for, and attentions to, the king her husband. Her severe losses, added to the ruin of Mecklenburgh-Strelitz, her native country, preyed so severely on her mind, that they soon brought this much-regretted princess to an untimely grave ! Anspach and Bayreuth were now given to the King of Bavaria, with Inspruck and the Tyrol ; and, as a further stimulus to the king's consent to the marriage of his eldest daughter with Eugene Beauharnois, Augsburg was also thrown in. Napoleon and Josephine, with the whole of their suite, were at Munich, when the ceremony took place. The King of Bavaria re ceived this great addition to his territory, in the way of reward, for having deserted the Emperor of Austria, as head of the German empire, and"], [679, "261 MILA N. leagued himself with Napoleon, the common enemy of all Germany. The Duke of Baden was next called on to fulfil his part of the stipulation ; and a niece of Josephine, who had once lived with the French general, Boyer, was ushered into the world, under the title of the Princess Stephanie Napo leone, and married to the above prince, who was created grand duke. This prince came to a premature death ; leaving behind him no male heirs to blush at the origin of their father's dukedom\u2014 the murder ofthe Duke d'Enghien! Another of Josephine's nieces, a Mademoi selle Tascher, was also lugged into the new im perial Napoleon dynasty, and married at Brussels to the young Duke d'Aremberg ; whom, how ever, she soon left, and went to reside at Paris. Pauline, who had been married to her second husband, the Prince Camillo Borghese, was also placed as governess over the people of Turin. All the imperial brothers, and sisters, and nieces, being thus provided for, provisoirement \u2014 for not a soul of them were allowed to have a will of their own\u2014 it now became necessary to do something for the parent stock, as well as for her worthy brother, the citizen Fesch ; who, though bred a priest, had become a commissaire de guerre, and had been living by gambling at s 3"], [680, "262 M I L A N. Paris. Accordingly, the former received the dignified appellation of Madame Letitia Napo leone, Dame de France ; while the latter was made Archbishop of Lyons, and a cardinal, \" par la grace de Dieu !\" Family matters being thus settled, the next necessary step for the support of the imperial government, was the erection of an aristocracy ; without which, Napoleon well knew no monar chy could long stand. It was not, however, to be an aristocracy, whose duty it would be to hold the balance between the sovereign and the people, but an aristocracy who were ready, at all hazards, to uphold his power, upon the same arbitrary basis on which he had founded his im perial authority. For this purpose, it became ne cessary, that the majority of it should be chosen from out of the class to which he himself belong ed ; namely, the military. He came, therefore, to the determination, that all his generals should be made marshals, and that all his marshals should (with scarcely an exception) be dubbed dukes and peers of France. The order of merit was also created, as a de coration, and many of the second and third ranks of the military, and even private soldiers, were presented therewith. This measure was of the greatest benefit to him ; since it kept im-"], [681, "263 MILA N. mense sums in the imperial treasury, with which he must otherwise have rewarded the services of those who had assisted in raising him to his giddy elevation : for many of the knights of the above order, as well as of that of the Corona di Ferro, had only a miserable pension of two hundred livres attached to the honour. And now, to crown the whole, and to raise Napoleon Le Grand to the acme of his wishes, Maria Louisa was safely delivered of a son, and all Paris were thereupon directed to sing \u2014 \" Unto us a son is born ; unto us a child is given !\" And, \" O ! miseras hominum mentes, oh pectora c\u00e6ca !\" even the colour of the \" caca du petit Roi de Rome,\" became the vogue at the imperial court : the looms at Lyons Were instantly set in motion ; and nothing was to be seen in the Parisian beau-monde, but this most predominant of all colours \u2014 an instance this of frivolity and of folly that, perhaps, was never surpassed, even by that giddiest of all giddy nations ! - The title given to this \" altera spes Rom\u0153,\" sufficiently accounts for the hasty kidnapping of the old Pope, of which I have already given a faithful account; for it would have been de rogatory to the dignity of the newly-born babe. s 4"], [682, "264 M I L A N. to have borne the title of \" King of Rome/' while the legitimate sovereign of that city, was still in the exercise of his lawful authority.

Indeed, such a call was there for every thing wonderful, that wonders themselves became lost in the clouds of sublime wonders, per formed in the wonderful \u00e6ra of the Great Em peror Napoleon and the Little King of Rome ! But, the most wonderful of all these wonders, was, that the said Great Man should have forgotten himself so wonderfully, as to have proclaimed this wonderful son \u2014 coming into the world with his head foremost, and with all his natural fa culties about him \u2014 the king of a mere city, instead of the sovereign of a whole nation !

The natives of Genoa la Superba have im mortalized themselves by their ever-memorable actions, by land as well as by sea, and more particularly for having freed themselves from the oppressive yoke of Austria, by chasing from their territory the renowned Marshal Botta, to gether with the whole of his army, unaided, but by the united bravery of its independent and courageous citizen ; to which glorious deed they were roused, by one of the German barba rians having, according to the custom of the northern nations, inhumanly inflicted corporeal punishment on one of their fellow citizens. Now, the people of Italy are not accustomed"], [686, "268 GENOA to the paich, or knout ; and no French or Italian officer had ever ventured so far to degrade them, as to use the cane, or bastinado. For the people of Italy are as opposite in character and in sentiments, from those of the north, as sterile Lapland and uncultivated Siberia are to their own voluptuous climate, and its delicious and luxurious productions. The Genoese territory extends around the gulph of that name, to Port Venere, on the east, to the little principality of Monaco, which formerly belonged to the Princess who accompanied the Prince of Conde in all his tra vels, during his absence from Chantilly, after the breaking out of the French Revolution. On the west, and in its rear, are the Imperial fiefs, which have been the cause of so much bloodshed. Not a braver race of men than the Genoese, are to be found on the continent. To render them equal to any in Europe, nothing is wanted but a virtuous and an uncorrupt go vernment. They are admirable seamen, and remarkable for their unconquerable aversion to the Austrians and the Piedmontese : but, hke the Venetians, they have been most infamously sold to this their most inveterate enemy. The experience of centuries has sufficiently proved, that, though the native Genoese love of liberty and independence may, for a time, be stifled"], [687, "GENOA 269 and borne down, it will ultimately burst forth with renewed energy, to the dismay and expulsion of their cruel enemy ; as it did in the case of the aforesaid Marshal and his mercenary forces. They have too much of the Corsican character in them, to yield up tamely, and without a struggle, the blessings which were enjoyed by them for cen turies. To suppose that they will not one day make an effort to shake off their detestable fet ters, would be to libel the whole Genoese nation. Let their task-masters, then, look to themselves! For I can tell them, that the Genoese are, with the single exception of the people of Corsica, the most crafty, as well as the most revengeful, people on the face ofthe earth. The victory obtained by them over Botta and the Austrian army, is narrated by them to their children, and is handed down from father to son. Like that of the Vespere Siciliane, it is ever in their mouths, to inspire the rising generation to valour, and to impress on their minds the great things their forefathers have accomplished, in the sacred cause of liberty and independence. It is customary for the other natives of Italy to say, that it requires five cunning Christians to outwit one Jew, but that to outwit a Genoese, requires a score of Jews ; and, to say the truth,"], [688, "270 GENOA. the extraordinary arts they had recourse to, during the protracted wars carried on by them against the Venetians, fully justify the as sertion. Generally speaking, the ladies of Genoa are remarkably handsome. .To which I may add, that they are elegant in their dress, and resem ble, more than any other females in Italy, those who may be considered the beauties of the world \u2014 I mean my countrywomen, the ladies of England \u2014 except in their passion for coquetry. Next to Naples, the situation of Genoa, when looked at in a boat from the bav, is the most enchanting of any in all Italy ; and perhaps in ad Europe. The picturesque appearance of the delightful lemon, orange, palm, and other choice fruit trees, intermixed with views of the fortifi cations, topped with the majestic mountains of the Bocchetta, Campo Marone, and Campo San Pietro, all at once under the eye of the spec tator, are foremost among the wonders of na ture and art, and, like the beautiful scenes to be met with in Tuscany, present the appearance of an amphitheatre, headed by an immense pile of magnificent marble buildings. Like Venice, the city of Genoa is grand be yond description, and impresses the beholder with a conviction of the immense wealth which"], [689, "271 GENOA these two republics had once collected together. Rich beyond any other country, and great and powerful, as England now is, nothing can be more evident than the simple fact, that her un travelled inhabitants can form no just concep tion of the immense riches which these two states must, at one time, have contained. No thing on earth, in my humble opinion, is so well calculated to correct the purse-proud vanity of some of my countrymen, as a short trip to the several places of which I have spoken ; but, above all, to Venezia la Ricca, and Genova la Superba. The port of Genoa, once the emporium of the world, is now as much deserted as if it were infected with the plague. Such, alas ! are the blessings which result from tacking the people of a free republic, to the tail of an abso lute monarchy ! \u2014 a junction as unnatural as that of the horse with the ass, and from which no issue can be expected, but a vicious, refrac tory animal, which it is impossible to break in, and which oftentimes succeeds in upsetting and damaging its keeper. The laws of Piedmont, which are those now in force at Genoa, are founded on caprice and partiality, and differ, in, their application, ac cording to the birth, the rank, and the title of"], [690, "272 GENOA the individual applying for their protection. From a total want of that permanent legislative justice, which can alone secure to the cultivator, the fruits of his industry, a complete stagnation has taken place in every branch of commercial speculation. The inevitable consequences of such a system have been discontent and misery, and utter ruin to its once rich and flourishing inhabitants. The trade of Genoa was at one time so ge neral in every article of commerce, in conse quence of her being unconnected with any continental power, and a free port, that I shall confine myself to pointing out the commerce peculiarly belonging to the soil and the manu factures of Genoa. It consists, then, of oils, pastes, and macaroni of all kinds ; of sweet meats, candied fruits, sugar-plums, mushrooms, fresh and dried ; and of the richest and stoutest silk-velvets in all Europe. During carnival time there is a good opera at Genoa ; but the inhabitants are of too plod ding a disposition, and are too much taken up in matters connected with cent, per cent., to pay any remarkable attention to the fine arts ; which are less cultivated and encouraged in that city, than in any other part of Italy. The present race of Genoese are so interested, that they"], [691, "273 GENOA. would rather have a pair of antlers clapped on their brows, than lose the lading of a cargo, or the unlading of a vessel when it comes into port ; when the struggle with every one is, who shall be before-hand with his neighbour. Such have been the blessed effects of the union of Genoa to Piedmont! and such will they continue to be, as long as a once free na tion shall be suffered to be thus excluded from the enjoyment of its legitimate authority, for the purpose of being made the foot-stool of ab solute and despotic power ! Now, if legitimacy is to be respected ; if, among monarchical governments, there can be no tranquillity without it ; and if, in conse quence, the sovereigns of Europe have entered into a Holy Alliance, for the purpose of esta blishing the principle ; why, let me ask, should not the legitimacy of republican governments be equally respected ? Have not those govern ments the same rights ? And, are they not as much the sacred depositories of the will of the people, as any monarch on earth can possibly be? The streets of Genoa are very narrow and confined, in the lower town ; and, in conse quence of its once immense population, the houses are of great height. The apartments, too, in general, are very lofty. Many ofthe rich VOL. II. T"], [692, "274 GENOA bankers and merchants reside in the one nearest to the heavens. But, the houses of the wealthy are absolutely palaces, consisting of numerous suites of rooms, most elegantly and richly fur nished. When Salicetti, the civil Massena of plunder, resided in Genoa, in all the pomp and splendour of an Asiatic monarch, under the disguise of a simple ambassador, he had one of these lodgings, \" next floor to the sky,\" fitted up in the most splendid style, in which he constantly gave the most sumptuous entertainments. This impu dent upstart caused an English lady to be dis charged from the Opera, because she would not sing at his private parties. The rich bankers, Emanuel Balbi, Gneco, and Andimini, were, in the year 1796, as I have already hinted, the persons who, at Salicetti's instigation, lent Buonaparte the sum of two hundred thousand livres, at the period of his first invading Italy ; without the loan of which sum he never could have commenced his Italian operations. In no small degree, therefore, have these bankers been the cause of the ruin of their country ; and therefore are they as much de tested throughout Italy, for their infernal trea chery, as the good Venetians are commiserated"], [693, "GENOA 275 for having been basely betrayed by the Smith field forestaller of nations. I regard, however, the smiles of these wretches, as little as I deprecate their frowns. Gold I know to be their god. I shall therefore ever speak of such creatures as Balbi, in the manner that their foul deeds merit. As I would gladly praise their virtues, if they had any, so will I ever expose and hold up to detestation, their vices ; knowing, as I well do, that those vices exist. But, above all, \" Dum nemor ipse mei, dum spiritus hoc regit artus,\" will I hold up to the horror of my virtuous countrymen, their execrable commerce in hu man flesh \u2014 a commerce which no man or wo man, with a drop of English blood in their veins, can ever hear of with calm indifference ! O, Wilberforce, Wilberforce ! for thy unwearied exertions in the cause of the jet-black negro, I thank thee ! But why \u2014 in the name of hu manity and of justice \u2014 why hast thou not been able to find a small corner in thy philanthropic bosom, for the interesting inhabitants of \" the pleasant garden of fair Italy ?\" But, \" non omnia possumus omnes ?\" It is solely from the favourable position of Genoa, and her general importance to Europe, t 2"], [694, "276 GENOA in a commercial and political point of view, that I am anxious to see that city freed from conti nental connexion.

But, it is not England ; it is not Russia ; it is not France ; it is not Prussia ; it is not Aus tria ; that can give freedom to Italy. No. The enjoyment of that first of all blessings, can only be attained and secured, by the united efforts of the people of Italy themselves. Foreign assistance is always to be dreaded ; for it uniformly ends in adding oppression to slavery. More than any other nation on earth, have the Italians been instructed, by long and sad experience, that every conqueror who has succeeded in over-running their envied regions, has uniformly laboured, not to promote their tranquillity and happiness, but to strengthen his own interests, by dividing their native strength, and by sowing the seeds of internal political divisions."], [695, "277 CHAPTER XXIII.

This country and Savoy were once looked upon as the impregnable barrier and safeguard of Italy, against foreign invasion. The Duke of Savoy is Prince of Piedmont, and, after the peace of 1745, assumed the title of King of Sardinia ; which title he received in return for Sicily ; the last-mentioned country having been, by the policy and wisdom of the late Hyde, Lord Clarendon, annexed, during his embassy, to the kingdom of Naples. The same able and excellent nobleman was the cause of the Low Countries being separated from French, as well as from Spanish influence, and given to the Empress, Maria Theresa of Austria. The wisdom of this deep-sighted policy has t 3"], [696, "278 PIEDMONT. been sufficiently manifested by the simple fact, that those countries continued in the undis turbed possession of the House of Austria, until the volcanic explosion, occasioned by the French revolution, subverted the equilibrium, which till then had existed between the civilized nations of Europe ; and it probably would be no exaggeration for me to add, that nearly three portions of the globe have felt the effects of its fatal influence. But, to return to my subject. At the last general peace, Austria was moderate and mo dest enough, to signify her determination to retain the possession of Piedmont ; under the ostensible plea, that the King of Sardinia was not sufficiently strong to prevent the future encroachments of the French \u2014 as if she herself had never been conquered by them ! England, however, with that native love of equity for which her sons are so distinguished, in order to maintain the even balance of power, sent her triumphant navy to Sardinia, to convey the sovereign of that country from his long in sular exile, and to place him, in open defiance of the wish of his imperial brother-in-law, on the throne of his continental dominions. The Piedmont territory, together with the Venetian states, form the northern boundary of"], [697, "PIEDMONT. 279 Italy, dividing Switzerland and Genoa from the Milanese. The Piedmontese are soldiers by nature, like the people of old France. None but the nobi lity were suffered to carry arms ; and nothing was esteemed so praise-worthy in the eyes of the men, or so captivating in those ofthe wo men, as the profession of war. A man who was seen without a sword, was a sort of noun ad jective in the vocabulary of the fashionable circles ; and though, perhaps, he could boast of nothing beyond a military commission in a ske leton regiment, that was a sufficient \" passe par-tout \" to the smiles and the good graces of his fair inamorata. From this, it is easy to imagine, what such a nation could have achieved, had it been gal lantly led on to the conflict and stimulated to lofty deeds by heroic examples, similar to those which the history of their own country afforded, during the glorious enterprises of the gallant Emanuel against foreign invaders ; for, if the sacred flame of liberty, which animated the breasts of the Piedmontese patriots, and which induced them to endeavour to save their sove reign and their countrymen from the disgrace of submitting to a foreign yoke, had not been T 4"], [698, "280 PIEDMONT. betrayed, the deliverance of Piedmont would have been secured. But, alas ! instead of this, in the very heat of action, these brave men were basely abandoned by the very individual, who, of all others, should have protected and stood by them to the last ! Most shamefully did he take to flight, and hand over his bravest subjects, as rebels, to the mer ciless vengeance of a foreign assailant. How often, under similar cruel circumstances, have those gallant patriots, who have been ready to de fend their native country to the last, been loaded with ignominy ; and the remorseless intruders upon their soil, held up to the world as con querors and as heroes ! Such may be the worldly policy of crowned heads ; but, by the commission of such deeds, they must never ex pect to stand approved in the sight of Him \" who wears the crown immortally.\" The language spoken by the lower sort of Piedmontese is neither Italian nor French, but a corrupt dialect, which can only be under stood among themselves. Turin, the capital of Piedmont, is entered by the fine straight road, shaded by a double row of lofty trees, leading from one of the king's country seats, called Rivoli, through the Porta Susina, to the fine street called La Dora Grossa."], [699, "281 PIED M ONT. Turin, which is a most interesting city, has been less noticed by travellers than any of the other cities of Italy ; probably, because it hap pens to be either the first at which they enter, or the last at which they depart, from the gar den of Europe. In the former case, they are generally too anxious to proceed to the south, and in the latter, are so satiated with what they have already beheld, that they rarely afford themselves time to appreciate its merits. Turin, however, is certainly equal to any in land town of Italy. Its beautiful arcades, the Strada del Po, the regal palace, the delightful view ofthe church of the Superga, rising above all the rest, amidst an amphitheatre of vine covered hills, and the windings ofthe classic Po, altogether present a most magnificent picture. Turin is the most regular built city in all Italy, and is embellished with a bridge, thrown by the French over the Po, and allowed to be a most exquisite piece of architecture. Then there are the two principal squares, the Piazza San Carlo, and the Piazza del Castello, both ornamented with splendid porticos, which form the promenade ofthe nobility, and are filled with elegant coffee-houses, inns, and shops of restau rateurs. On crossing the bridge of the Po, are beheld, on the south, the fertile plains of Saluzzo, abound."], [700, "282 PIEDMONT. ing with beautiful gardens and groves, and rich lands, ascending all the way up to the convent ofthe Madonna del Monte; from the terrace of which may be had a complete view of all I have been describing. The city of Turin is laid down on a fine grass plat, like a map. It is of no great ex tent, but it is neat, elegant, and excessively cleanly, the streets being washed every day ; and all the surrounding country is in a state of the highest cultivation. There are two very good theatres at Turin. The smallest is called the Teatro di Carignano,' and is opposite to the palace of that name ; the other the Gran Teatro, which is a most beau tiful building, but it is not open, except during carnival season. The church music of the high mass is per formed in a most perfect manner ; but the style differs greatly from that of the sacred music in this country. The beautiful church of the Superga, which is situated at a distance of five mdes from the city, was built by Victor Ama deus, in commemoration of the battle won by the famous Prince Eugene over the French. Formerly, the Grand Opera was kept open at the expense of the court ; when it was the uniform practice to present every performer nightly with a new pair of white gloves, and"], [701, "283 piedmont. all necessary refreshments. The precise time which the music and ballet were to occupy was minuted ; that the performance might termi nate at a fixed hour, in order that the morning's devotion of the court might not be broken in upon by the amusements of the preceding night. The court of Turin was at one time the most brilliant in all Italy, and in etiquette and dress was the complete model of that of France. Now-a-days, the ladies dress more in the English fashion. They are well made, and have fair complexions and good features ; though not quite so regular as those of the ladies of Genoa, or Sienna. They are, however, exceedingly de licate, and possess a peculiarly interesting soft ness of manners. The men are taller, and of a fairer com plexion, than the rest of the Italians. In the valleys of the Alps, both sexes, but more espe cially the women, have large goitres, which de scend from their necks, like those which are seen amongst the inhabitants of the valleys in Switzerland. The Piedmontese in general, and especially the inhabitants of Turin, are the least lively of any of the people of Italy. They have, indeed, a sort of sadness about them, which almost in duces melancholy. The natives of the gen teeler description are elegant in their manners,"], [702, "284 PIEDMONT. have a considerable portion of solidity in their character, are studious and sensible, and write both French and Italian with great elegance. The lower orders are very industrious, and have every appearance of ease and comfort. They are remarkably fond of dress, and the shopkeepers' wives 'and daughters have no small portion of the French coquetry in their man ners. The Piedmontese cultivators of the soil are in general well off in their circumstances ; the country being remarkably fertde, and producing corn, rice, fruits, and vegetables, in the great est abundance. There are in Piedmont, an amazing number of fine mulberry trees, the leaves of which serve as food for the beautiful worms, whence is derived the silk which forms so considerable a branch of their commerce. The Piedmontese silk is, indeed, the best in all Italy ; and particularly the organzined : while the system of irrigating the meadows, as in the Milanese, by means of the numerous sluices, canals, and rivers, is a perpetual source of benefit to the agricultural interest. Montferrato and Asti produce excellent wines ; indeed, the best in all Piedmont. Asti is rather a considerable town, and cannot con tain fewer than eight or ten thousand inha bitants. In it is the family mansion of the"], [703, "285 PIEDMONT. great tragic poet, Alfieri. All along the plains, to the very confines of the Alps, is to be seen an abundance of the finest cattle. A certain French author, in giving a descrip tion of Italy, tells his readers, that Piedmont \" est un pays peu favorise de la nature.\" Alas ! how happy would the people of Italy have been, generally, and the Piedmontese in parti cular, had this been the case ! The most destructive vice of gaming is but too prevalent amongst the Turinese. Tarraco is the national game. The cards vary from those used in other countries, and are greater in num ber. The billiard tables at Turin are also too much frequented. The Piedmontese are a very hospitable people ; and especially those who reside in the country. To say the honest truth, it is much easier to gain admission, both to the houses and to the tables of the Italians, from the affa bility and familiarity of their manners, than it is in any other country in Europe \u2014 a fact this, which proves that there exists a much less por tion of distrust in the Italian character, than foreigners have been led to believe. Formerly, any person possessing a good ad dress and a genteel appearance, would, on making an acquaintance at a coffee-house, be"], [704, "286 PIEDMONT. invited home by the most respectable inhabi tants, and introduced to their families ; but, unfortunately, together with many other humane and estimable customs, the French Revolution has destroyed and rooted out this amiable national characteristic ! The moral conduct of the people of Turin is not so loose and incorrect as it is at Milan, at Naples, and at many other of the principal cities in Italy. The excellent example afforded by the regularity uniformly observed by the court, has the effect of keeping the higher or ders at least, within the external bounds of decency and rectitude. The young Turinese ladies are kept shut up in convents, until the period of their marriage. A good deal of con traband gallantry may, peradventure, exist among the higher order of married women ; but, in the second class, it is less frequent, and is car ried on with much secrecy. In point of years, the marriages in this country are often ofthe most disproportionate kind. The business is commonly all settled before the bride is once thought of. Her consent has, indeed, nothing to do with the business. The weighty points are the pin-money, a box at the opera, a car riage, a town-house and a country-house, and a whole train of male and female domestics."], [705, "287 P 1 E D M O N T. The Piedmontese all follow the Catholic per suasion ; excepting at Lucerna, where a small population resides, in one of the districts of the Alps, who have been converted to protest antism, and who are protected in the peaceable exercise of their religion, by the public au thorities. The buildings at Turin are simple in their structure, but remarkable for their style of architecture. The king seldom resides in the city, but passes the greater portion of his time on the banks of the Po, at his different country seats, at Stupinegi, Villa della Regina, La Veneria, Rivoli, and also at Genoa. Turin was formerly protected with ramparts and ditches. It possessed also a citadel which was an uncommonly fine fortress, but which was nearly destroyed by the French. Indeed, it still remains ; but though it has been recently repaired, it is not strong enough to protect the capital from an invading army. The library is very a good one. The biblical treasures it contains are immense. In the Uni versity, and the Museum, are to be seen an excellent collection of antiques ; and amongst which, is the famous Isiac table of brass, found at Mantua, covered with Egyptian hierogly phics. Literature and the fine arts are much"], [706, "288 PIEDMONT. cultivated in this city. Indeed Turin has given birth to many distinguished classical writers. The Savoy family is said to be the eldest in Europe, excepting the royal family of Eng land, and dates its origin from the time of the Tarquins. The Sovereigns of Piedmont have ever been absolute. They have, however, ex ercised their power with much mildness, and many of them have been great politicians as well as warriors. Victor Emanuel, who recently abdicated the throne, was brother to the Charles Emanuel, who \u2014 after the death of the Saint-like Clotilda, who fell a sacrifice to grief, in consequence of the cruel martyrdoms of her brother, Louis the Sixteenth ; her angelic sister, the Princess Eli zabeth; and her adored sister-in-law, the much injured and ever-regretted Queen of France \u2014 abdicated, and took up his residence at Rome, where he resided until his death. He was mar ried to Maria Theresa, Arch-Duchess of Aus tria ; by whom he had four daughters. Victor Emanuel was much beloved by his subjects, and was considered as an excellent prince, and a man plain in his manners, easy of access, and greatly attached to the people over whom he reigned. Nor would it be possible for the most evilly disposed person to fix on"], [707, "289 PIEDMONT. him an act of injustice. Indeed, the dignified conduct of king, queen, and princess, after their return to Turin, impressed every one with the greatest respect for them ; and, in particular, for the queen, who was greatly and justly beloved for her amiable manners, her enlight ened understanding, and her uncommon talents. She spoke three languages with equal elegance and fluency. The present queen, too, is generally beloved for her exemplary conduct, her piety, and her uncommon goodness of disposition : while her unbounded charity proves her to be a genuine daughter of her generous-hearted and immortal mother, the late Queen Caroline of Naples ; to whose memory I have already endeavoured to pay my humble tribute of gratitude and af fection. The great misfortune of the late sovereign was that of having restored, upon his return to his dominions, the absolute power which he had been accustomed to exercise previously to the French revolution. The civil and criminal code of laws introduced by the French, imper fect as it was, and unsuited to the habits and dispositions of their transalpine subjects, was undoubtedly more favourable to freedom, and better suited to the times, than the former one : VOL. II. u"], [708, "290 PIEDMONT. for there are many articles in the present re stored system, which bear strong marks of the old feudal slavery. For instance, a subject of his Sardinian Ma jesty is attached to the soil, and cannot dispose of his immoveable property, nor absent himself therefrom, without the royal permission. There is, too, a marked difference between the pu nishments set apart for the noblesse, and those which are applied to the lower orders : like the law in Spain, by which an illegitimate person committing a deadly crime, is never hanged ; upon the presumption, that he may, perchance, be the son of a grandee ; and there fore has he the amazing privilege of being sent out of the world a head shorter than he came into it, instead of being hung up by the neck \u2014 and all for the honour of the thing ! The judges in Piedmont were accustomed to demand a fee for every sentence they pro nounced ; and without which sentence, there were no means of enforcing punishment. Ar bitrary power of this description, when placed in the hands of men who are under no respon sibility but to their own consciences, must ever be liable to the grossest abuse. Another vicious practice obtained, not only in Piedmont, but nearly all over Italy ; namely,"], [709, "291 PIEDMONT. legal procrastination, and by which procrastina tion individuals were often suffered to lie rotting in the prisons, year after year, before their fates were finally decided upon. Amongst the most crying vices, were the salvi condotti, and the biglietti del Re ; which were protections, given by the king to favourite individuals who were in embarrassed circum stances, and by which the creditor was often kept out of his property for years, and some simes in secula seculorum ; as the biglietti em powered a nobleman to re-enter upon the pos session of property which he had disposed of, during the political changes that hadtaken place, on returning the sum that had been originally paid him, without giving a valuable consider ation for the money that might have been laid out in repairing the buildings, in draining the marshes, and in other expensive improvements. Primd facie, no doubt, this appears a most violent and arbitrary proceeding, to be sanc tioned by royal authority. But, the fact was, that the exorbitant contributions that were often levied on these noblemen compelled them to dispose of their property for a mere trifle, for the sake of preserving their personal liberty or their lives ; and, when the restoration took place, the King of Sardinia found himself u 2"], [710, "292 PIEDMONT. obliged, from policy, to protect those who had formerly been sacrificed for their fidelity to his cause. That there were a great number of abuses on both sides, there can be little doubt. The above measures did not, however, fail to di minish greatly the popularity of the late reign ing family ; though the ministry were certainly composed of individuals of strict honour and unimpeachable probity, as well as of consider able talents. The Count Brigioli, the Count Balbi, the Count San Marsan, and others, were alike respected for their private virtues as for their public services. The barbarous and horrible punishment of the wheel is still resorted to against criminals guilty of house-breaking, robbery, and murder. The exorbitant duties on exports and imports are much complained of by the commercial interest, and are alleged to be highly des tructive to the spirit of industry. Beggars are less frequently met with in the streets of Turin, than in any other city of Italy. The police is excellent ; and the streets are well lighted up, and kept in a cleanly condition. This city is about two miles in length, and con tains a population of little less than a hundred thousand souls. It is built in the form of a"], [711, "293 PIEDMONT. star. By standing on a certain stone in the centre, the streets may be seen all branching regularly from it ; each street terminating with a beautiful view of the surrounding country. One of the most praiseworthy public in stitutions to be met with at Turin is La Rosina. It is an asylum for female orphans, who are industriously educated and instructed in all sorts of needle-work, and . who are ena bled thereby to earn a sufficiency for the sup port of the establishment. The public prisons in Turin, as well as the houses of correction, are, like those of the rest of Italy, in a shocking and even disgusting condition. Humanity revolts at the little at tention that is paid to these establishments ; from which Christian charity appears to be totally excluded, and in which the misery which the wretched inmates are destined to undergo, is calculated rather to engender a savage resent ment against their hard-hearted keepers, than to redeem them from the paths of vice, and render them, on their return to society, useful subjects for the remainder of their lives. O ! that the Buxtons, and the Frys, and the Gur neys, and the rest of the followers in the foot steps of the immortal Howard, who, by their unwearied exertions have so greatly improved u 3"], [712, "294 PIEDMONT. the Discipline ofthe Prisons of our own country, had but leisure to look into those of forlorn Italy, and thereby to complete the good work, so long ago set on foot by that excellent man, who devoted his time, his strength, his fortune, and finally sacrificed his life, in the pursuits of humanity ; and who, in the expressive language of the immortal Burke, \" visited all Europe, not to survey the sumptuousness of palaces, or the stateliness of temples ; not to make accurate measurements of the remains of antient gran- deur, nor to form a scale of the curiosity of modern art ; not to collect medals, or to collate manuscripts : but, to dive into the depths of dungeons ; to plunge into the infections of hospitals ; to survey the mansions of sorrow and of pain ; to take the gauge and dimensions of misery, depression, and contempt ; to remem ber the forgotten ; to attend to the neglected ; to visit the forsaken ; and to compare and col late the distresses of all men in all countries.\" With regard to the political feelings of the people, it is very natural for the old aristo cratical nobility, who revelled in mdk and honey, and who contributed, neither in the way of taxes nor of other personal duties, to the exigencies of the state, to sigh for the res toration of that system."], [713, "295 PIEDMONT. The majority of the people, however, regret the loss of the French government ; and espe cially the rising generation, who had fondly flattered themselves with the idea of one day becoming the instruments of their country's independence. From the dazzling example of the French, they were worked up to a pitch of enthusiasm ; but soon, alas, they found the good old proverb realized \u2014 \" God for us all ; but every one for himself.\" Again, and again, and again, I repeat \u2014 -that, if the people of Italy ever expect to accomplish the independence of their country, aid of every description, except that which they may derive from their own united strength, will tend only still further to tarnish their glory, and more firmly to rivet the fetters by which they are now bound down to the earth. The Ergastolo, at Turin, serves as an asylum for that unfortunate class of females, whose depravities have already inflicted upon them almost the greatest punishment that can pos sibly accompany human misery ; namely, that of being an outcast of society \u2014 a situation this, which loudly calls on every civilized nation to ameliorate their hard lot, and to awaken them to a sense of their degraded condition, rather by a mild and encouraging treatment, than by u 4"], [714, "296 PIEDMONT. resorting to a system of needless rigour, which can only have the effect of confirming them in vice ; and of exciting in their breasts a desire to return to the vicious pursuits which they had abandoned, from seeing themselves treated as if they were still in the practice of them. Lenity will generally be found to effect what severity can never accomplish. As La Fontaine justly observes, \" Plus fait douceur que violence.\" The King's forces are, for the greater part, composed of Piedmontese. The rest are Ge noese, Savoyards, Sardinians, and Nissards. The Savoyards and the Genoese are constantly at variance with the Piedmontese : so much so, indeed, that it has long been found necessary, in order to prevent mischief, never to allow these regiments to garrison in the same town. When completed, the army of the King of Sardinia may be reckoned to consist of about sixty thousand of the finest men, bearing the most martial appearance, and capable of under going greater fatigues, privations, and hard ships, than any of the other Italians. The late abdicated monarch was remarkably fond of the military, and would drill his officers him self, in the gardens of his palace."], [715, "PIEDMONT. 297 Provisions of all kinds are extremely cheap at Turin. The veal, mutton, lamb, and poul try, are excellent. Milk, cheese, and butter, are to be met with in the same perfection as in the Milanese. They have also a peculiar sort of bread, made in the shape of a bamboo cane, called grissin, which is preferred by the Pied montese to the common bread. When broken, it eats like biscuit. The kitchens in Piedmont are in a much better condition and more endurable, than those in any other part of Italy. The oil, which is so much used in the south, is nearly banished from the cookery. Indeed, the famous French cooks were formerly sent to finish their educa tion at Turin, in the kitchen of his royal high ness the Duke de Chablee, who was allowed by the gourmands of the day, to keep the most exquisite table in all Europe. Truffles are abundant in Piedmont, and are allowed to be superior to those of any other country, in size, colour, and flavour. They are variegated like nutmegs. Excellent fish is also to be met with in Piedmont. The common wines are not to be boasted of ; but those of Asti and Monteferrato are good bodied, and both red and white arc equal in quality to almost any in Italy."], [716, "298 PIEDMONT. Lodgings are remarkably cheap at Turin ; which city abounds likewise in all kinds of tables d'hote and restaurateurs, where every thing that the belly of the veriest glutton can yearn after, may be obtained on moderate terms. There are also a number of coffee houses and ice shops, where the gentry of both sexes read the newspapers during the morning. But, by an Englishman, these papers are scarcely worth looking at, as they are mere copies from the French Journals ; no Editor in Italy being allowed to exercise his judgment, by offering his own honest opinions. In Piedmont there are numerous manufac tories of velvets, silks, stockings, tapestry, chamois leather gloves, ear-rings, &c. English cottons and French woollens, both raw and manufactured, are introduced by the way of Genoa. As Piedmont is the key of Italy, every Ita lian has a natural interest in its welfare; as well from its situation, as from the known valour and virtue of its inhabitants in former times. Let us hope that they will one day rise superior to the obloquy which now hangs over their heads, by imitating the noble examples set them by their valiant forefathers ! I have been more particular in my account of"], [717, "299 PIEDMONT. this part of Italy, in consequence of the scanty notice which has been taken of it by the gene rality of our travellers, and because I have felt anxious to speak of it in the terms which it richly merits ; having myself the honour to belong to a noble family of Piedmontese origin ; a branch of which transplanted itself to Venice, in consequence of the last great plague which desolated that country.

The best way of travelling from Venice to Padua, is to adopt the practice of the natives ; namely, to hire a boat called a peotta. The common conveyance, which is the barca di Padova, is changed at Oriago ; for the water becoming more shallow, the first boat is no further navigable. The price of the passage from Venice to Padua is about three or four Venetian livres. The boat is sometimes filled with tolerable society ; but, the one which sets off from Venice at night and arrives at Padua the next morning, is by no means an advisable mode of travelling ; not that it is unsafe, but the company consists of such an olla podrida of fish, flesh, and fowl, mixed pell-mell toge ther, of all sorts and sizes, old and young, thief takers and market women, butchers and what not, that a decent traveller becomes heartily tired of his journey before he arrives at the end of it. These vessels are towed up and down the Brenta, by means of horses. When the passen gers happen to be particularly desirous of quick-"], [719, "301 PADUA ening their pace, for the purpose of getting in an hour or two before the usual time, they club each of them a trifle, and thereupon the master of the barca, according to the sum given him, will clap on an additional horse or two. If any of the passengers shoidd become tired of tra velling by water, carriages are always ready to convey them by land. The company in the day boats are generally entertained with music and singing, performed by strollers, who pick up a livelihood in this way. They are also often honoured by the presence of one of those itinerant improvisatori, for which Italy is so renowned. Persons attend regularly to supply you with fruit, wine, liqueurs, oys ters, and other eatables and drinkables, accord ing to the season. Every thing may, however, be procured on the banks of the river; as the boats are constantly stopping to take in and let out passengers and parcels, and also to dine, if the company should be so disposed. A peotta is a private concern, and will either stop or proceed, at the convenience of those by whom it has been hired. I should here observe, that foreigners, on changing the boat at Oriago, are generally as sailed by innumerable idle fellows, who offer to assist them in removing their luggage. They"], [720, "302 PADUA should, however, be especially careful, on entering the boat, for the sake of economy as well as security, to place every thing under the charge of the master of the vessel. Padua is a large and antient city. The streets are wretchedly paved, and its buildings greatly resemble those of the city of Bologna. Some of the streets have arcades and are re markably narrow. The city is supplied with abundance of water, both for public and pri vate use. Its situation is remarkably pleasing. The soil is exceedingly fertile, and produces an abundance of the necessaries as well as the luxuries of life, at a moderate rate. But, notwithstanding all these advantages, Padua is thinly populated. For, if we except the convents, the seminaries, and the famous university, founded by the Emperor Frederick the Second, in opposition to that of Bologna, and at one time containing eighteen thousand students, Padua does not contain a tenth part of the number of inhabitants which it is capable of holding with convenience. \" Mantua v\u00e6 miser\u00e6 niraium vicina Cremon\u00e6 ! \", The neighbourhood of Venice, of which Padua is supposed to be the mother, has, in many respects, been fatal to her : and parti-"], [721, "303 PADUA cularly so, since the overthrow of the Venetian government and the destruction of her com merce; the Padovese having been reduced to the necessity of depending for a subsistence solely on their territorial revenues. Though, during the existence of the Repub lic, Padua was chiefly supported by the Venetian nobility, and looked, before and after the Viag giatura of the Venetians, like a city deserted, in consequence of the plague ; yet, from their ancient enmity towards the Venetians, the in habitants, at the dissolution of the government, had the cruelty to refuse to them a daily supply of that first necessary of life, fresh water, and actually prohibited, for some days, all commu nication with the barges which conveyed it to Venice ; until at length they were compelled, by force, to desist from their inhuman and truly diabolical project. The first object of curiosity at Padua, is the church of its patron, Saint Antonio, whose tomb is surrounded with rich and exquisite basso-re lievos, in white marble of the purest quality, and finished in the highest style of workmanship, re presenting the wonderful miracles performed by Antonio. At the foot of it are steps for the ac commodation of the people who come to pay their devotions at the shrine of their favourite"], [722, "304 PADUA saint, whose body is supposed by them to emit a particular odour, highly agreeable to the olfactory nerves. There are, however, certain crevices, through which it would be no difficult matter to introduce balsams and other odoriferous sub stances. Not that I would, for the world, be supposed to insinuate, that monks or friars were ever capable of resorting to such scandalous im positions ! In the centre of a little court, in the front of the church, is a remarkably fine equestrian statue, modelled by Donatello of Florence, which was erected by the Venetian Republic, to the memory of the famous general, Gatame lata. The convent of Santa Giustina, the cradle of the first reformers of the order of Benedictines in Europe, is one of the finest in Italy. The members of it were the richest of their order, and consisted of the most distinguished nobles of Venice and the Terra Firma. The Church of Santa Giustina was built by Andrea Riccio, after the designs of Palladio, and produces an effect approaching to that which is produced on beholding that ne plus ultra of all temples, Saint Peter's at Rome. The roof of the great nave, or body of the church, has seven domes, serving it both for light and orna-"], [723, "305 P A I) U A ment. The twenty-four chapels which encircle the lower part ofthe church, are richly adorned with specimens of the first architecture, of va rious orders, each differing from the other. The famous picture ofthe martyrdom of Santa Giustina, over the great altar, which is said to have taken place on the spot where the church stands, is considered the chef-d'\u0153uvre of Paul Veronese. The basso-relievo of the benches in the choir is admirable, and the design is, in every respect, fine and striking. It represents the prophecies of the Old Testament, relative to the coming of our Saviour, with their accom plishment in the New. Minutely to describe the beauties of this church would require a volume. The Convent of San Giustina was governed by one of its regular members, called the Padre Abbate ; as is the case, indeed, with most of the convents in Italy, excepting those which happen to be under the controul of the cardinals ; who are by no means considered in a favourable point of view by the other monks ; which monks, by way of revenge, thus define the character of the cardinal-\u2014\" animal rubruin omnium bene ficiorum capax, rapax, vorax.\" The office of Padre Abbate is held for three years ; at the ex piration of which time, the person who so held it VOL. II. x"], [724, "306 PADUA has no more rank or power, excepting the title, than the other friars of the community. But, \" once an abbot always an abbot.\" So he passes from one convent to another as the Padre Abbate ; though he cannot resume the office, in the convent to which he was first elected, until the expiration of nine years. One of the numerous wonders to be met with in Italy, is the immense town-hall in the Palazzo della Giustizia, which is more than ninety feet wide, and two hundred and sixty in length, and which has no other support for its vast ceiling, but its four walls. Here are to be seen the emblematical and astrological paintings by Pietro d' Apono, who, it is said, gave the design to the famous Giotto, the father ofthe Italian painters. Leandro Alberti, speaking of the said Pietro d'Apono, says, that this distinguished man \u2014 \" era eccelente astrologo e filosofo, benche no tato d' aver commercio et gran familarita col diavolo !\" Pietro, it seems, was born at a vil lage about four miles from Padua. He studied medicine for some time at Paris, and was there promoted to the degree of doctor in philosophy and physic. When he came to practise, he is said to have insisted on large sums for his visits. When sent for to attend Pope Honorius the"], [725, "1'ADU A. 307 Fourth, he demanded four hundred ducats for each day's attendance. He was suspected of magic, and prosecuted by the Inquisition on that account. \" The common opinion of almost all authors,\" says Gabriel Naude, the physician to Lewis the Fourteenth, in his Apologie des Grands Hommes accuses de Magie, \" is, that Pietro was the greatest magician of his age ; that he had acquired the knowledge of the seven liberal arts, by means of seven familiar spirits, which he kept enclosed in a crystal ; and that he had the dexterity to make the money he had spent come back into his purse !\" Pietro d'Apono died, however, before the process against him was finished ; being then in the eightieth year of his age. And, after his death, he was ordered to be burnt in effigy, in the public place of Padua. There is a story told of Pietro, that, having no well in his house, he caused his neighbours to be carried into the street by devils, when he heard they had forbid den his maid to fetch water there. \" He had much better,\" says the shrewd Bayle, \" have employed the devils to make a well in his own house, and have stopped up his neighbour's ; or, at least, transported it into his house, rather than into the street.\" So much for Pietro d'Apono. In the town hall is also to be seen a cenotaph x 2"], [726, "308 PADUA to the memory of Titus Livius, the immortal historian of Rome, who was a native of Padua. In the Duomo, or cathedral, there are two very striking busts ; one of Pope Benedict the Fourteenth, the other of Cardinal Rozzonico, his successor. When he was Bishop of Padua, Rozzonico obtained from Benedict the renewal ofthe privileges of the cathedral, the revenues of which were better administered than those of any other cathedral in Italy. In grateful re membrance of which, and also of the good management ofthe cardinal bishop, the chapter erected, during his life-time, this monument to Benedict, which is executed in a superb and excellent style. In the sacristy of the cathedral there is a fine portrait of the celebrated Petrarch, who had been a canon of the said cathedral, and left thereto the greater part of his library. The portrait is said to have been taken during the life-time of the poet. His countenance is sin gularly bridled, and displays a mournful melan choly, such as might naturally be expected of a bard, who was eternally singing \u2014 \" de tant d'ennuis, mieux ecrits que penses.\" Besides a number of colleges, public as well as private, there is at Padua the Gymnasium, the interior of which is entirely disfigured on"], [727, "309 PADUA all sides, by satires and wretched verses, written by the students of all the nations of Europe, in favour of the different masters and professors. There is also, in an obscure corner ofthe build ing, an anatomical theatre, large enough to hold seven hundred persons ; each seat being divided from the other by a railing in an eliptical form. I have been informed, from undoubted au thority, that it was Fra Paolo who furnished the original plans of the building : for this cele brated man was as profound a geometrician, as he was a theologian and moral philosopher. The Venetians will have it, that he was the in dividual who first discovered the theory of the circulation of the blood. Be that as it may, what Blaise Pascal was to the French nation, Paul Sarpi certainly was to the Venetian Re public. It was under his superintendence and general auspices, that the great Galileo commenced his brilliant career at Padua, every step of which career was marked by discoveries which have immortalized his name ; and whose invaluable labours so deservedly insured to him the patro nage and the powerful protection of all the great men of the Republic, against the zealous and ignorant spirit of faction which then began x 3"], [728, "310 PADUA to discover itself among the professors in the several universities of Italy. Notwithstanding, however, the great support which he met with, from the prudence and the wisdom with which the Venetian government resisted the opposition of the factious to his new and astonishing discoveries, Galileo, en couraged thereto by the reiterated solicitations of his sovereign, Cosmo the Second, Grand Duke of Tuscany, determined upon quitting the situation which he enjoyed at Padua and in the Venetian states, and returning to Florence, his native country ; where he fondly hoped to enjoy, for the remainder of his days, that peace and that tranquillity, which the lasting benefits he had conferred on the world at large, so richly entitled him to. A correct idea of the lucrative situations which he enjoyed, ofthe rank in which he stood, and ofthe estimation in which he was held by the Venetian government, may be formed, from the perusal of a letter written by the patrician Gio van Francesco Sagredo to Galileo, on his quit ting the service of the Venetian Republic, in viting his return to the same in the strongest language, and almost foretelling the fatal con sequences that were likely to ensue, and that"], [729, "311 PADUA actually did befal that great man.

It was the constant endeavour of Galileo to disencumber science of the jargon of Aristotle, and of the schools. He methodized and ar ranged the theory of the descent of bodies and"], [735, "P A D U A. 317 projectiles ; and by fixing his eye accidentally on the waving to and fro of a lamp suspended from a lofty roof, the regularity of its vibra tions suggested to him the application of a pendulum to the mensuration and division of time.

Having been educated as a physician, he had, early in life, dissected human bodies ; a practice, as my readers well know, absolutely necessary for men in that profession. While he was attempting, on a cer tain occasion, to demonstrate to his associates, that many of the nerves originated from the brain, he at length silenced doubt, by positive ocular proof: \" I should be convinced you were right,\" was the reply of one of them, \" if your deduction was not contrary to the opinion of Aristotle !\" While speaking of the opposition which the immortal Galileo met with from the ignorance and fanaticism of his enemies, it may not be amiss to give a short anecdote, which will at once show, even in those dark ages of super stition, the superiority of the Venetian coun cils, in matters appertaining to opinion, and the freedom which writers, in the pursuit after knowledge, were allowed to enjoy."], [736, "318 PADUA During one of the examinations, which it was customary for three of the members of the Procuratia of Venice, forming a sort of special jury, \" per la reforma dello studio di Padova,\" to make, from time to time, into the state of the university of Padua, Father Berlinzone accused Galileo, before the said members, and before the public assembly, of being a man ofthe most immoral and licentious habits ; asserting, that he kept one mistress at Padua, a second at the Gambarara, where he generally passed his time in the holidays, when he had leave of absence, and a third at Venice, which city he visited every week. Being interrogated by the magistrates, Gali leo replied, that his pursuits, both of body and mind, were the same as those of other men, and, in many points, the same as those of his accusers ; but that he had never been guilty of the things laid to his charge ; on the contrary, he stood in need of many little . enjoyments, which his situation and his salary did not allow him to indulge in. After hearing Galileo's defence, the said magistrates retired for the purpose of confer ring on the subject. They returned, however, in a few minutes to the council-chamber ; and, to the great delight of all present, declared,"], [737, "PADUA 319 that they had consulted together, and had thought it necessary to double the salary ofthe accused ; which determination would, they were confident, be immediately ratified by the Venetian Government ; which would, very pro bably, even again double it, the better to enable Galileo to employ his time for the fu ture, in the way most conducive to his own comfort, and to the advantage of the Re public. Galileo had not long left Padua and settled at Florence, before he soon found to his cost, that Aristotle's doctrine, however ill-grounded, was held too sacred to be safely called in question. Having, in the year 1 612, observed some solar spots, he published that discovery, in l6lS, at Rome ; in which, and in some other pieces, he ventured to assert the truth of the Copernican system, and adduced many new arguments to confirm it. For so doing, he was cited before the Inquistion ; and after some months' imprisonment, was released upon a simple promise, that he would renounce his heretical opinions, and not defend them by word or by writing. But, having afterwards, in 1632, published, at Florence, his \" Dia logues of the two greatest Systems of the World, the Ptolemaic and Copernican,\" he was again"], [738, "320 P A D U A cited before the Inquisition, and committed to the prison of that dreadful court at Rome. The congregation were convened, and, in his presence, pronounced sentence against him and his books, obliging him to abjure his errors in the most solemn manner ; committed him to the prison of their office during their pleasure ; and enjoined him, as a saving penance, for three years, to repeat, once a week, the seven penitential psalms. \" Are these, then, my judges!\" exclaimed he, in retiring from the Inquisitors ; whose ignorance struck him with astonishment. In this dungeon he was kept for the space of a year, and some writers say for two or three ; and was continually threatened to be burnt alive, if he would not recant his heresies, as they were called. For a long time Galileo resisted ; but, on one of the monks, of the order of St. Dominic, informing him, that their court had condemned him to be burnt if he would not retract, poor Galileo, knowing that there was no appeal from their decision, ac quiesced, and consented to delare publicly, on his knees, that his doctrine was false. As he was ascending the steps of the inquisition, he whispered to one of the monks, who was his friend, and who, moreover, entertained the same"], [739, "321 PADUA opinion, \" pure padre mio, gira, gira, e non il sole ; truly, my father, it is the earth that goes round, and not the sun.\" While Galileo was in prison, he was visited by Milton, who informs us, he was then \" poor and old.\" The confessor of his widow, taking advantage of her piety, obtained leave to pe ruse the manuscripts of this great philosopher, and destroyed such as, in his judgment, were not fit to be known to the world ! Like Mil ton, poor Galileo became, in the year 1639, totally blind ; and, like Milton, he supplied the defect by constant meditation, and by dictat ing his sublime conceptions to others. One of the richest and most respectable establishments at present at Padua, is the seminary that was founded, towards the end of the seventeenth century, by the illustrious Car dinal Barbarigo, whose virtues have formed a subject worthy of the genius of the learned Dr. Burnet, in a panegyric, as distinguished for its elegance and force, as it is for its free dom from fulsome adulation. The Cardinal left to this excellent establishment a yearly revenue of fifteen thousand ducats ; which sum, together with its other funds, enables it to provide board, lodging, and other necessaries of life, for a hundred curates.

Pope Rozzonica, when he was Bishop of Padua, interested himself very much in behalf of this establishment ; to which is attached an excellent printing office, having a plentiful sup ply of Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Oriental type, which is made use of for the benefit of the said seminary. Many other excellent printing offices are also to be found at Padua, the works proceeding from which are distinguished for correctness, for elegance, and for the excellent quality of the paper \u2014 three things which are rarely to be found in other Italian editions. The students of Padua have also the benefit of two admirable libraries, one belonging to the cathedral, the other to the city ; and both con taining many very rare books, as well as manu scripts of the greatest value. For more than two centuries Padua has possessed within its walls, a garden of botanical curiosities, which, by art and industry, have with stood the removal from an Asiatic clime. It has also an excellent museum of natural his tory, well known to, and much esteemed by, the Italians ; who, if they have not been our masters, have certainly been our preceptors.

No Venetian can fill any civil employment in his native country, under the present Austrian government of those territories, un less he will consent to do so gratis. As every secret, however, is said to have its price, the person so accepting office, often contrives, by betraying the trust reposed in him, to get more money than he would do if he had a stipulated salary. The government, however, saves that salary ; and so the offence is passed over with impunity. The particulars of all political, cri minal, and civil matters \u2014 the intended opera tions of government \u2014 ministerial cabals \u2014 every kind of information, may be come at, provided the treachery is well rewarded : but, without the golden passe-par-tout, no one is allowed even to take a copy of his own documents, though those documents may have been printed and publicly registered.

It has been said, that the Merceria at Venice has been well stocked and supplied, since the Austrians have become the rulers of the Vene- tian provinces. I am ready to grant that which must be apparent to every one. If quarters of bull-beef; if trumpery tin-boxes fided with phosphoric matches ; if gin and coffee shops ; if tallow-chandlers', and barbers', and bakers' shops ; if cobblers'-stalls ; if the sacks of meal and grano Turco, which now fill this once beau- tiful place, instead of the diamonds, and the pearls, and the mountains of gold chains, un- equalled in quality by those of any other na- tion ; and the rich ancient and modern gems of every denomination and value \u2014 and the most costly manufactures and productions of all parts of the known globe, which exclusively filled them for fourteen centuries, and were the admiration and delight of every civilized coun- try \u2014 if, I say, an exchange of the last-men tioned elegant articles, for the coarse wares which it now contains, bespeaks it \" well stocked and supplied,\" then indeed is the Merceria well stocked and well supplied ! The metamor phosis is too horrible for reflection or comment ;"], [745, "327 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. and can alone yield gratification to the taste of barbarians ! The greater part of the shops in the Mer ceria were formerly the property of the ancient nobility, who would only let them to the above most respectable class of merchants ; but, in consquence of the high taxes levied on them, and other ruinous operations of the Austrian Government, the effects of which have been a total stagnation of trade, the original lessees have abandoned them to even still more wretch ed proprietors, who, to satisfy the demands of the authorities, have been compelled to suffer them to be inhabited by the tag-rag and bobtail description of traders I have already mentioned, and even to the venders of fried fish and fri lotes \u2014 to the amazing annoyance of all the neighbourhood, from the offensive smell of the oil used by the followers of these savoury callings. That my readers may be able to form an idea of the way in which the Venetians are governed, and how strictly the orders of his Imperial Majesty are executed by his ministers, while his Imperial Majesty is travelling about, for the good of his faithful subjects, as well as for his own private amusement, I will give a few anecdotes. They contain facts, of which y4"], [746, "328 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. his Imperial Majesty should not be kept in ignorance. His Imperial Majesty has issued a decree, directing, that no hawkers or pedlars shall be suffered to follow their ambulatory calling, in the Merceria, to the injury of the few respect able tradesmen who have shops there, and who pay enormously for them. Notwithstanding which, the understrappers of the police, in the teeth of this decree, allow them, on being paid a certain douceur, to place in it their filthy baskets, and boxes, and stalls, to the injury of the aforesaid shopkeepers, -and the great annoyance and obstruction of pas sengers. The poor peasantry, who bring a few eggs to Venice, are obliged to pay the sum of two pence, before they are suffered to sell them in the market ! Such a thing was never thought of under Buonaparte's rapacious government ; nor, indeed, under any government except the present. The tender-hearted and accommodating por tion of the fair sex are charged a stipulated sum, before they are allowed to carry on their meretricious profession. Being classed, by the present well-ordered and religious government, in the list of regular traders, of course, they"], [747, "329 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. are in duty bound to contribute their fair pro portion to the exigencies of the state ! This system of licensed prostitution, united to the general misery of the country, has very much tended to the increase of crime, and of the number of those free-trading artistes ; whose habitations, under the Venetian government, as well as under the ancient republics of France and Rome, were prudently confined to a par ticular part of the city. For the better in culcation, however, of good morals by good examples \u2014 which, no doubt, is the sole object of those who now rule, command, and ordain, in the once really happy Venice \u2014 the said fair traders are allowed to carry on their profession, and expose their articles, pro bono publico, in every quarter of the town ! But, from the vast contraband trade which is carried on between their last intruders' wives and daughters, the business of these fair traders is reported to have fallen off \u2014to the great detriment of his Imperial Majesty's treasury ! The small canals at Venice are so much neg lected, that it is sometimes difficult to navigate the gondolas. The pavement in the Piazza di San Marco, once as even as glass, is become dangerous to walk on. The bridges also are in an equally dilapidated condition."], [748, "330 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. Whenever his Imperial Majesty, or any of the illustrious princes of the august house of Austria, visit the city of Venice, or the pro- vinces in the Terra-Firma, they generally leave behind them, for the honour they have con- ferred on their subjects, a souvenir, in the shape of an augmentation of the price of all the ne- cessaries of life, to defray the expence which has been incurred during their residence. The poor dejected citizens of Venice always pay dearly for the honour of having amongst them the \" father of his people.\" The sumptuous fetes given on these joyful occasions\u2014 the ex- pence of the court \u2014 the lodgings for the impe- rial household \u2014 are never paid for by the Go- vernment, but are defrayed by new taxes levied on the people, The representations given on these occasions at the theatre Fenice, are al- ways at the expence of the proprietors ; who, very often, are not even allowed a ticket for themselves or families ; as the government, on those nights, dispose of the whole house as it thinks proper. The Hospitals and Asylums for the poor were formerly innumerable at Venice. Medi cines too, and medical assistance, were afforded gratis to respectable poor families. Now, alas, the latter kindly practice is discontinued ; and"], [749, "THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. 331 of the many former, only two remain, which take in male and female, civil and military, patients indiscriminately. All are huddled to gether in the same rooms, like those bundlings which we read of in American books of travels, or like the baths at Baden, near Vienna, where pure and impure, alike enjoy the luxury of the same delightful effluvia. And, as the provi vions and medicines required for these hospi tals are farmed to those who will supply them at the cheapest possible rate, it may readily be imagined, that the quality is not of the very best, nor the quantity the most abundant. During one of His Imperial Majesty's visits to Venice and the Terra Firma, he was much pleased with a building at Brescia, erected in the days of the Republic, as an asylum for re duced citizens, who were not of a class to be sent to the common infirmaries ; and which building, for a considerable time after the down fall of the Republic, had been supported by the voluntary contributions of private individuals ; Buonaparte having applied its funded revenues to other purposes. These private individuals, however, having themselves suffered so severely from plunder, and the heavy contributions levied upon them, were no longer in a condition to succour these"], [750, "332 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. decayed citizens, or to keep the building in repair. This circumstance His Imperial Majesty feelingly lamented, and desired to know, what sum would be necessary to put it into a state to answer its primitive purpose. On being in formed, that a few thousand ducats would suffice to render it a comfortable home for the descrip tion of persons for whom it was originally in tended, his Imperial Majesty said, that he would give orders, that the money required should be sent, as soon as he should arrive at Milan ; kindly adding, \" that the worthy crea tures, for whose sake the building was originally erected, should not be in want of an asylum for so trifling a sum.\" His Imperial Majesty adhered to his promise ; and the money destined for so laudable a pur pose, was placed in the hands of the most res pectable inhabitants of Brescia, subject to the inspection of the government agents, that not a ducat might be laid out unnecessarily. Nay, so desirous were the gentlemen of Brescia to see the gracious intention of His Imperial Majesty carried into complete effect, that the sum sent was increased by individual donations. But, alas ! by way of return for the trouble, and anxiety, and expence they had been at, they received from the Aulic Council at Vienna,"], [751, "333 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. a few months after, a peremptory and positive order to refund the money so given, and so em ployed. This happened, to the best of my re collection, in the year 1816; and, when the gentlemen of the committee for the said charity remonstrated with the Aulic Council, and stated, that the money had been remitted by order of His Imperial Majesty, for the express purpose of defraying the expence of the repairs necessary to prevent the entire destruction of the said useful building, and that without it, the unfor tunate inmates must have perished in the streets, or have become common paupers or thieves, to avoid actual starvation ; the only answer they received from Vienna was, that \" the money must be refunded ! \" When I left the country, this circumstance was the leading topic in every conversazione. Let the Austrian Government refute what I have asserted, if it can. Ready am I to apologize, and to atone, sorany mistake or misapprehension into which I may have been led. But, the truth is, that, since the death of the great Prince Kaunitz, no minister of Austria has had the good policy to treat its Italian subjects otherwise than as a race of conquered slaves, fitted only to live under the lash of a military government. It is not thus with the Germans in Austria."], [752, "334 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. The government at Vienna is a paternal govern ment. The Emperor Francis is, on all hands, allowed to be a mild and affable, a humane and just, monarch. May the evil be probed to its real source ! The city of Treviso is well populated, and is surrounded with the country seats of the Ve netian nobdity, it being only twelve miles from Venice. Formerly, the post went and came from the one city to the other every day ; but, in consequence of recent Austrian regulations, the inhabitants of Treviso are deprived of the pleasure of sending letters to, or receiving let ters from, Venice more than once in five days ; namely, on those days in which the courier goes to and from Vienna ; though they pay six times as much for the postage of these letters, as they did under the old Venetian government. In consequence of this, there are no means of communication between Venice and Treviso, but by sending expresses on horseback, at a considerable expence ; and even then, if the writer of the letter should have omitted to have put the word \" express \" on the outside of it, the man is not allowed to proceed, and the writer is liable to a penalty. The private inhabitants, the merchants, and the nobility of Treviso, offered the government,"], [753, "335 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. therefore, to maintain, at their own expence, the former regulations of communication between that city and Venice ; but, incredible as it may seem, the offer was rejected with disdain ; as, indeed, every thing is, that does not originate in that sanctum sanctorum, the Camera Aulica at Vienna. From the organization of the Austrian laws at present in force at Venice, a poor creditor stands no chance whatever of recovering his claim against a rich debtor. First, from the deficiency of the laws themselves ; secondly, from the ignorance of those by whom they are administered ; and, thirdly, from the enormous stamp and register duties on all legal proceed ings, and from paying which duties not even paupers are exempted. This latter is indeed a crying evil : but, it is an evil which, unhappily, is not confined to Italy ! The attention of the parliament of our own country has recently been called to this all important subject, by that upright senator, and sensible and benevolent model of an English gentleman, Mr. John Smith, the member for Midhurst. Heaven prosper the good work ! In justice, too, to the memory of the late excellect political economist, Mr. David Ricar do, I must here state, that he was accustomed"], [754, "336 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. to say, that \" almost every public man who was labouring to ease the burdens of the people, by the reduction of taxation, had his particular hobby-horse ; some were for taking off this tax, and some that ; but his own hobby-horse was, the reduction of the enormous stamp duties on legal proceedings, and which enormous stamp duties operated, in the case of the poorer class of the community, as an absolute denial of justice ! A will, executed with all the prescribed for malities of the laws of Venice, may, under the Austrian mode of judicature, be set aside and declared null and void, upon two persons coming forward and swearing, that the deceased had promised by word of mouth, in their pre sence, to dispose of his property otherwise. In my strictures on the Napoleon system of government in Italy, I have candidly confessed, that thousands ofthe labouring poor were con stantly employed in keeping the high roads in repair ; that the revenues of the Venetian state, and more than the revenues of the Venetian state, were expended in that country, in encou raging the fine arts, in the establishment of schools for the education of youth, and in re wards given to men of literature and of science. All, however, has been totally bouleverse, ex-"], [755, "337 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. cept the most rigorous military promptitude in exacting the government taxes ; in which no mercy is shown, and no discrimination is made, with regard to persons or circumstances. In short, every thing that was laudable in the French system of rule, has been abolished \u2014 every thing in it that was vexatious, oppressive, and humiliating, or calculated to perpetuate the miseries of that once incomparably flourishing state, has been retained, to the eternal disgrace of its rulers. To draw down upon the heads of the poor Venetians the compassion of all Eu rope, it is only necessary to compare their former prosperity with their present degradation. May the pen, now in my hand, become an humble instrument in the righteous cause ! During the time of the Venetian Republic, all the offices of great public trust were filled by the patricians, whose residences were at a consi derable distance from the Ducal Palace, where most of those offices were concentred. For the sake of convenience, therefore, the said patri cians had casinos allotted to them in St. Mark's Place, or near it. Part of the building called the Procuratia was also specially appropriated to their use. On the fatal dissolution of the government, VOL. 11. z"], [756, "338 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. these casinos, which formerly served the patri- cians for apartments to dress and undress in, when they went to, or came from, their different offices, as well as for dwellings in the bad season, when it would have been imprudent to risk them- selves on the Grand Canal, were rendered en- tirely useless. Many of their proprietors retired to the country, intending, if possible, to make a trifle by letting these casinos. From so doing, they were, however, prevented, by the civil and military authorities, who took violent possession, without allowing any thing for the use of them, though there was then a decree of his Imperial Majesty in existence, commanding all those who were employed under the Austrian Government, not to inhabit any lodging without duly paying for the same. Nevertheless, no magistrate could be prevailed upon to enforce the imperial de cree ; and, in defiance of all justice and all equity, the individuals who ought to have been their guardians, were the very first to violate the sacred law of hospitality towards the objects whom they were bound and pledged to protect, by suffering the invasion of their property with impunity. The noble the Marquis Marruzzi, together with his mother and sister, were kept out of"], [757, "THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. 339 their superb suite of apartments in the Procu ratia, for years ; until at length, tired out, he determined on making a journey to Vienna, for the purpose of obtaining permission to turn out the intruders ; and, after a struggle of some years, he was suffered to retake possession of his own property, after it had been shamefully damaged and defaced by the filthy Austrian employes. From the same cause, Francesco, one of the princely family of Pisani, had been obliged to quit the magnificent palace at San Stefano, and take up his abode at Padua ; though every housekeeper pays five per cent, upon the value of his palace, towards the support of the mili tary, that soldiers may not be quartered upon them, to the irreparable injury of their beautiful buildings and paintings. The damage that has been done by the Aus trians, from the more than Gothic savagism of introducing enormous iron stoves into these pa laces, which they heat until they are red hot, is inconceivable, and, in many instances, has ter minated in their total destruction by fire. In this way, the magnificent palace Cornaro, which is situated on the grand canal, fell a sacrifice, in the month of December 1817, to the total ruin z 2"], [758, "340 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. of numerous clerks, who had deposited their property therein. For these Hottentots, if there were five hundred rooms in a palace, are sure to settle their dirty carcases in the galleries which contain the finest paintings ; and there, Vandal like, will they amuse themselves, by mutilating and destroying every vestige of former Venetian grandeur! To be convinced ofthe extent of the mischief occasioned by the operations of these barbarians, in cases of fire, my reader has only to bear in re collection the account I have given, in my first volume, of the destruction committed during the fire in the afore-mentioned palace, by a set of savages, more intent upon plunder than on the extinguishment thereof. What the implacable element had spared, was speedily demolished by a horde of five hundred Croats ; creatures, who, to this day, are as uncivilized as are any of the slaves of Africa. But, what was to be expected from a race of beings whose senses are benumbed by their native atmosphere ; and on whom the sun \" scorns to shine \" for eight months out of the twelve, and, for the other four, has not suf ficient power to thaw their frozen natures by its genial heat? The fires that have been so frequent in all the"], [759, "341 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. public offices, have been the result of the most far-fetched avarice that ever entered into the mind of the meanest of governments ; namely, the compelling the clerks in the different public offices to labour many hours by candle-light. In consequence of which, when the master whipper-in allows them to depart\u2014 without whose permission they dare not budge an inch \u25a0 \u2014 they are all so anxious, after having been confined for twelve or fourteen hours, to quit their tread-mills and their task-masters, that they set off, leaving the horrible iron stoves, of which I have been speaking, red hot ! In the happy time of the Republic, during a period of fourteen centuries, all kinds of public business was terminated before sunset. Since the Austrians have become the unnatural and illegitimate rulers of Venice, there have been, I boldly assert, more accidents in that city, oc casioned by fire, than there were during the whole of the afore-mentioned long period. The beautiful Procuratia, in one part of which the governor, the Count de Goess, has thought proper to take up his residence, has already been more than once damaged by fire ; and, should these Vandals persevere in their barbarous northern system, there can be little doubt, that z3"], [760, "342 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. one day or other, this, the finest building in Europe, will fall a sacrifice to the execrable innovation. German stoves were never intended to be the inmates of marble Italian palaces. \" O ! reform it altogether.\" It is exactly the same with respect to the German system of legislation, which is not at all suited to the soil and character of the Italian people. The strongest proof of this erroneous perseverance therein, is to be found in the ex treme difficulty with which the laws, arising out of that system, are execnted, by violence and by force. In consequence of this there have been more appealsto whatis called law, during the short rule of the Austrians in the Venetian territory, than there had been for centuries during the time ofthe Republic. And, until they can make it appear, that the sterile and frozen regions of Lapland resemble the delicious and luxuriant climate of Italy, all northern laws and regulations will an swer no good purpose, but will merely tend to hasten their own destruction, by daily increasing the disaffection, and weakening the attachment, of the people, by forcibly compelling them to submit to laws, which are altogether unconge nial with their native habits."], [761, "THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. 343 Now, politically speaking, the laws of a country should always be adapted to the nature of the soil. Until we can metamorphose them into Germans \u2014 until we can change their pure climate into a bleak one, the produce of their generous vineyards into brown kale, their wines into beer, their figs and their grapes into sauer krout, their rich fruits into coarse knudles, and their natural vivacity into phlegmatic pedantry \u2014 or vice versd \u2014 Italians will be Italians, Ger mans will be Germans ; and, though both na tions may have their respective virtues and good qualities, they cannot become cordially united. Force and violence may be resorted to, but the task will be found too hard a one to be accom plished \u2014 Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret. ' Strive to expel strong nature\u2014 'tis in vain ; ' With double force she will return again.\" The futility of every attempt to change human nature ought to be a lesson to all governments. It is the rock upon which most of our political calculators have run foul, and was one of the great errors of Buonaparte's misguided and fallacious policy ; since he foolishly imagined, that it would be as easy to compel every man"], [762, "344 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. to become French, as it was to gain the much talked-of battle of the bridge of Lodi ; over which bridge he passed, by crying out to the Italians, \" Liberty and Independence ! \" To the magic sound of those two words, in the ears of the too credulous people of Italy, was he mainly indebted for his first influence amongst them. But, how woefully did he afterwards betray them ! If the Emperor of Austria be determined to follow in Napoleon's footsteps ; or, if he fancy that he can transform Italians into Germans, and attach them by affection to German laws, in the same way as his dear son-in-law falla ciously calculated on attaching them to the laws of France ; the fate of the exile of St. Helena, holds out to him an awful, but instructive lesson, as to the consequences that may be predicted of such a fatal line of conduct. The history of the Romans, of Charlemagne, of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden, of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and even of Napoleon Buonaparte, proves to the world \u2014 that a people who have been conquered will fight, until they learn how to conquer ! From all the circumstances which I have de tailed in this my humble performance, I think"], [763, "345 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. I have proved, most indisputably, that the Ve netians have been treated as a nation of vde slaves ; nay, worse \u2014 as a nation of conquered rebels, instead of being treated as an enlight ened, an intelligent, a free, and an independent people. Nay, their state of abject degradation has been rendered still more galling to them, from the consideration, that that which is denied to them, has been yielded to the negro, by all the Christian powers in Europe \u2014 by the very power which now holds the people of Italy in slavery ! It is heart-rending to reflect, that the only nation still groaning under the galling weight of a foreign yoke, should be the very nation, that fled from the tyranny of a barbarous Gothic invasion, to the uncultivated marshes of the Adriatic, rather than sacrifice that liberty and that independence, which have animated the bosoms of a Livy, a Father Lana, a Marco Paolo, a Petrarca, a Dandolo, a Carlo Zen, a Tressino, a Foscari, a Sapi, a Goldoni, a Gqzzi, and a Canova - all men of the greatest eminence in their respective professions, and whose ta lents and virtues, though they may have been equalled, have never been excelled.

I was, indeed, only the other morning, considering with myself the way in which \" this consummation devoutly to be wished \" could be best effected, when in stepped a friend, to whom I had entrusted the sheets of my work for his candid opinion, and between whom, and the reader's humble servant, the following short dialogue took place. Authoress. Good morning, Sir : I see you have brought back the pages of my humble performance. I tremble to hear your honest judgment upon them. Friend. You have no occasion to tremble, Madam. I have read both your volumes with the greatest care, and am, I assure you, much pleased with their contents. I pronounce your first volume to contain the very best account of Venezia la Ricca, that has hitherto appeared. What title, may I ask, do you purpose giving to your work?"], [13, "PREFACE. IX Authoress. The usual one \u2014 \" Memoirs;\" or \" Travels;\" or \" A Journal ;\" or \" A Narrative ;\" or some thing of that general sort. Friend. All \"filthy dowlas,\" Madam! Why, those are the very titles adopted by the swarm of tourists, who tell nothing, because their method of travelling supplies them with nothing to be told, and in whose volumes there is not any thing to be found, but such general accounts as leave no distinct idea behind them. What a severe castigation has Dr. Johnson given this class of scribblers ! \" He that enters a town at night,\" says the Doctor, \" and surveys it in the morning, and then hastens away to another place, and guesses at the manners of the inhabitants, by the entertainment which his inn afforded him, may please himself for a time with a hasty change of scenes, and a confused remembrance of palaces and churches : he may gratify his eye with a variety of landscapes, and regale his palate with a succession of vintages ; but, let him be"], [14, "PREFACE.

He that reads these books must consider his labour as its own reward ; for he will find nothing on which attention can fix, or which memory can retain.\" Authoress. Excellent ! most excellent ! To that descrip tion of travellers, however, you do not, I hope, Sir, consider me to belong ? Friend. Assuredly not, Madam. But hear the Doc tor's concluding observation, which is strikingly applicable to your work : \" He that would travel for the entertainment of others, should remember, that the great object of remark is human life. He only is a useful traveller, who brings home something, by which his country may be benefited ; who procures some supply of want, or some mitigation of evil, which may enable his readers to compare their condition with that of others ; to improve it wherever it is worse, and wherever it is better to enjoy it.\""], [15, "PREFACE.

It is most felicitous, and shall forthwith be adopted. Friend. A word or two more, Madam, as to our mo dern tourists.

Two of the best books of travels that have appeared for many a day are the productions of ladies. Mariana Starke's \" Information and Directions for Travellers on tlie Continent\" is one of the most useful little works ever published. Authoress. It is so. No person should set foot on the Continent without it. Friend. You have given the \" Imperial white-wash ers,\" as you very properly call them, some hard blows. Authoress.

The facts and anecdotes contained in the following pages, are the result of close observa tion, made during a long residence in Italy ; but more especially in that very interesting portion of it, which has been so little attended to by our modern writers of books of travels, known as the Venetian States. From the opportunities which my rank in life afforded me, of mixing in the first societies, I have been enabled to observe the nobility and gentry of that country in their public, as well as in their private capacity \u2014 in their court eti quette, as well as in their more easy domestic circles. I know the general character of the people of Italy. I have both \" summered them and wintered them.\" I am intimately ac quainted with their local habits, their manners, their customs, their propensities, and particu larly as they affect the interests of my own country : a species of knowledge this, which it is impossible for those superficial doers of"], [21, "P Ii E F A C E. XVII books of travels to obtain, who, in nine in stances out of ten, are either ignorant of the language of the country they are attempting to describe, or out of humour and mortified at the difficulty they have found of getting introduced into that good society, by mingling in which, real and genuine information can alone be ob tained. I assure my readers, that I have \" nothing extenuated nor set down aught in malice.\" The facts I have detailed, have either come within my own knowledge, or have been com municated to me by persons of the highest respectability and consequence. Many ofthe anecdotes detailing the rise, progress, decline, and fall of the Buonaparte Family, and their conduct in the Milanese and Venetian territo- ries, will be found highly interesting. Nora re they less true than they are curious. Though I have been a great sufferer by the revolutionary system, and though my husband has been brought to the very verge of the grave, and has lost nearly every thing by it, \" hors I'honneur,\" b VOL. I."], [22, "XVIII PREFACE. yet have I been too deeply impressed with the sa cred duties of morality and religion, to commit a single line to paper, under the influence of re sentment or of black revenge. As an honest narrator of facts, I have felt it my duty, in describing the actual situation of Italy, to go out ofthe beaten track pursued by most of my contemporaries, and especially in that portion of it, which has been so cruelly treated by the soi-disant regenerators of that ill-fated, but beautiful country. To impartiality, I trust I may fairly lay claim \u2014 \" Tros, Tyriusve mihi nullo discrimine agetur\" \u2014 the conduct of Napoleon, and the conduct of the agents of the Emperor Francis, in Italy, have alike been painted by me in the characters they deserve.

XX In honest truth, the entire of the Doctor's work is calculated to give the people of England a false impression, with regard to the genuine character of Buonaparte and the whole of his family. The Doctor tells us, that \" on leaving Napoleon's presence, he hurried to his chamber, carefully to commit to paper the topics of con versation.\" Of the Doctor's laudable activity, in endeavouring to lay the foundation of that \" posthumous fame,\" which he tells us Buona parte felt \" such a conviction of)\" and that his time was profitably employed, I have no doubt. To scrub the blackamoor white, has, however, ever been considered a difficult task ; and I am not without a hope, that the present publication will have a tendency to open the eyes of those who have hitherto been playing at blind-man's bust*.

What the situation of Italy was, at the close of the seventeenth century, the reader will have seen from the beautiful lines which I have chosen by way of motto to the present volumes. What the situation of Italy is, at the commence ment of the present century, I have endea voured to shew in the following pages. The remedy \u2014 the sole remedy \u2014 pointed out by that great and good man, Mr. Addison, for the ma nifold miseries which afflicted that fairest por tion of God's globe at the former period, so strikingly continues to be the one that is called for in the present, that I am confident I shall be excused for introducing it at the close of these my prefatory observations.

Deeds of cruelty the most wanton and unheard-of have been exercised towards them ; while submission the most pliant, on the part of the forlorn victims, has but served to render still more obdurate the hearts of the civilized savages, who have taken upon themselves the task of governing this most beautiful, but ill fated portion of the globe. Unhappy Venice ! thy melancholy fate might surely have drawn down upon thee the charity of the whole world! In any age but an age of selfish ness and cold calculation, to have beheld thee alone, would have been sufficient to have called forth the indignation of mankind.

Glad, indeed, should I be, could I honestlyexonerate our rulers from the imputation of having assisted in the transfer of the Genoese to the yoke of their ancient foe and inveterate rival, the King of Sardinia ; and happy shall I consider myself, if the earnestness of my language should tend, in however small a degree, to rouse them from the sullen lethargy into which they appear to have fallen, ever since the conclusion of the last peace, and induce them to turn their serious attention to the present alarming situation of the European dominions. Up to that period, in what a different point of view was the Cabinet of St. James's consider ed by the people of the Continent !

The transitions have been too vivid, the extremes too violent. Throughout, there has been an obvious absence of what political painters would call the chiar' oscuro, the due admixture of great with small states ; the generous blending of minor with large powers, which is indispensable to the for mation of that true equilibrium, which, for ages, had served as a city of refuge, and a tower of safety, to all and every member of the great European family, alike against external assailants and domestic traitors. The first infractions of that admirable league are, most probably, to be looked for in the earlier encroachments upon the rights and liberties ofthe people of Poland \u2014 encroachments which, as the brave Kosciusko was accustomed to observe, spread with amazing effect their vulture wings, both in and beyond Europe; and gave rise to the loss of America, the invasion of the Netherlands, the French revolution, the revolution of Spanish America, of Spain herself, and of Portugal ; together with the long list of fatal calamities with which the world has been afflicted, and those which may still await us ; thereby awfully realizing the forebodings of b 3"], [42, "6 VENICE. the immortal Pitt, when contending, not for a partial re-instatement of things, but for the status quo, whole and entire, unqualified and unbroken. But, it is time for me to return to the Vene tians. And, in earnestly recommending that wise and beneficent people to the fostering regard of Great Britain, I. feel that I am only acquitting myself of a duty incumbent on every one who may have had the happiness of residing amongst, and of becoming intimately acquainted with them. As a stupendous monument of human skill and industry, the city of Venice was calculated to have secured to herself the protection of the sovereigns of Europe. Rising out of the waves, like the Goddess of Smiles and Graces, and enriched with the gems of Orient, she dazzles the beholder ; who involuntarily exclaims, \" Surely a more appropriate symbol of com mercial advantages can no where be found !\" For centuries was Venice distinguished as the only maritime city in Europe, affording a shelter to vessels infected with the plague, even when driven away from other ports ; and thus were mariners without number snatched from the jaws of death, and millions upon millions of property rescued from the watery deep."], [43, "7 VENICE. True nobility of mind, when thus united to vast political advantages, forms assuredly that precise species of merit, which is the least questionable in the eyes of society. Indeed, the Venetian polity, as history amply bears testimony, was no less sagaciously calculated to neutralize the inroads of popular fury and revo lutionary adventure, than the firm pediments and massy bulwarks of their city to withstand the ragings of the pitiless ocean. As, amidst the latter, her fair towers were seen rising in pride and glory, so were the interests of the Republic found flourishing with the former. The melancholy fate of the unfortunate Ve netians may, indeed, be placed on the list of parricides ; a destiny which, alas, but too com pletely exalts Palma (who painted the day of judgment in their senate-house) to the rank of a prophet. But, what exposes still further this infatuation, on the part of the European powers, is the re-instatement of all the petty princes of Italy in their dominions ; no portion of which dominions is of any importance to England, with the single exception ofthe port of Leghorn. In the name of common sense, then, why should Venice and Genoa, the staunch friends of Eng land and of commerce, be singled out for de struction, and condemned to the most abject b 4>"], [44, "8 VENICE. thraldom ; while Tuscany, Parma, Modena, Lucca, and other minor states, are left in peace able possession of their former privileges, al though of inferior importance, even when com bined, to the Venetian territory alone ? It is therefore evident, I think, that Venice and Genoa should be restored to their former independent condition. In which event, they would become depositories for British manu factures, and promote their circulation through out the surrounding districts, in preference to the manufactures of powers less mercantile, and therefore less able to afford them equal advantages. But, at present, what is the condition of Italy ? A total stagnation of commerce ! general misery ! And, with regard to the two great maritime cities in question, such has been the rapidity of their decline, that they are mere squalid skeletons of their former selves ; pre senting lamentable and striking instances of the instability of earthly grandeur. Splendid palaces falling into decay ; magnificent temples de serted ; and their once opulent inmates reduced to very poverty and rags, and wandering up and down, destitute even of the common necessaries of life i In fine, misery the most abject, ruin the most complete, is apparent on every side ;"], [45, "VENICE. 9 with the solitary exception of those dens of usury, the hideous tenants of which are seen battening in the midst of desolation and de struction. In free ports, speculation proceeds with energy. In the event, therefore, ofthe Ligurian and Adriatic commonwealths resuming the atti tude which they presented in the good old times alluded to in the British Parliament by Lord Grenville, the friend and colleague of Pitt, I would venture to propose Leghorn and Trieste, as fit models for imitation. Neither, unless, crouching as it were to Napoleon's plans for shutting us out of the Continent, we are afraid of extending our views beyond an intercourse with a few islands, can I see any reason why we should longer withhold our assistance to suffering humanity ; or delay to extend, like wise politicians, our own inexhaustible resources. To say the truth, the calamities which have been occasioned by war, can alone be com pletely repaired, by the introduction of a just and liberal commercial code, calculated for the whole of Europe; and, in the arrangement and settling of which code, Great Britain, wealthy and powerful as she is, ought to take a prin cipal part. At present, the most shameful pro hibitions are enforced at Venice, against all"], [46, "10 VENICE. merchandize coming from England. In such dread are these same manufactures of ours held by the German impiegati, that, at first sight, one would almost fancy them to be satu rated with the elements of contagion. And, in a certain sense, they may, by comparison, be said to be so ; for I am well convinced, that no manufactures, either for quality or price, can be brought into competition with those which this country is able to supply. Not a servant girl in England would put on the coarse dresses worn, during the morning, by the ladies through out the German dominions. No wonder, then, that British goods should be excluded as much as possible. The old adage, that \" comparisons are odious,\" is here completely applicable ; for I can hardly name an article of manufacture to which what I have been urging does not apply. So decidedly superior are all the productions which we are in the habit of exporting. Napoleon over-reached himself in many in stances ; but in none more completely than by the enactment of. his famous decrees against British commerce. For, however much a war of a political character may be unpopular with the people of England, an appeal to arms in defence of their commerce, has uniformly been a favourite with them. The Corsican's man-"], [47, "VENICE. 11 dates from Berlin and Milan were, therefore, in every point of view, injudicious. Great indeed is the influence of Austria throughout Italy. Ever since the year 1815, that influence has been spreading with a fearful rapidity, which ought to have roused the atten tion of the reflecting portion of Europe. In addition to her dominions in Lombardy, with the exception of the poor Ionian Islands, she is in possession of the whole of the Venetian States, together with Istria and Dalmatia, coun tries which, time out of mind, have been the nurseries of the most skilful mariners, and the bravest soldiers in Europe ; producing, too, such excellent timber for ship-building, and such capital masts, that Buonaparte directed a supply of them to be conveyed to Toulon, Brest, and the other sea-ports of France. At the present moment, the two-headed eagle bears sway throughout the whole country, from the confines of Savoy, sweeping through the Neapolitan kingdom, back to the hereditary empire. However favourably the conduct of Austria may have been regarded by the unwary portion of the world, who, looking only at one head of the imperial bird, have permitted her progress without suspicion, her formidable alli ance with Russia, Prussia, and all the German"], [48, "12 VENICE. States, with the exception of Bavaria, ought to rouse the jealousy of every one of the powers concerned. Without respect to persons, the designs of inordinate cupidity should be checked; the career of excessive encroachments should be arrested. To advert, for a moment, to the invasion of Spain by France. With what grace can England interfere in behalf either of Spain or her colo nies, if she refuse to assist in the rescue of Piedmont and Naples from the grasp of Austria ? But, expediency is the politician's plea ; and \" expediency\" is certainly a very imposing ex pression. It is irresistibly urgent ; and every way competent, in its bearings on the stage of ambition, to make the actors oppose or submit, advance or recede, assist or abandon. It can palliate crimes, however atrocious. It can blur the virtue of heroes. It can on one day per petrate deeds the most foul and ignominious ; and, on another, perform achievements the most noble and praiseworthy. Call upon politicians to perform their pro mises on the morrow, \u2014 and a future indefinite period is fixed on. Indeed, I may venture to say, from sad experience, that the moment of per formance will never arrive. For, if they really intended to put their promises into execution,"], [49, "VENICE. 13 hope, the medicine of the miserable, would not be uniformly administered ; or, at all events, the accomplishment would follow close upon the heels of the promise. When, too, the service is actually rendered, it bears no proportion with the expectations raised, and will have resulted from intermediate causes, novel and unlooked-for at the time of the flattering proffer. Politicians delude but too frequently. The sweets of idle words are gene rally as fatal to the hungry expectant, as honey is to flies. But, besides this, there is a blunt and rude demeanour, which craft can assume \u2014 a vinegar calculated to render palatable the nauseous food\u2014 a sort of sham ignorance, a pretended want of experience, an affected aukwardness, the sharper in the peasant's frock, the hyena in the fable ; \u2014 a mode of deception this, the most pernicious to the world at large."], [50, "CHAPTER II. VENICE. Transactions relating to Venice at Campo Formio Fall of the Venetian Republic Its Causes Buonaparte's burning Decrees against British Merchandize Conse- quences ofthe Prohibitory System. While the Venetian noble Giusti, and the late Secretary Orazio Lavezzari, were engaged at Campo Formio, for the restoration of the affairs of the Venetian Republic, and during the residence of Grimani at Vienna as her ac credited ambassador, under the sanction of Buonaparte, transactions involving her total ruin were in preparation. A variety of spe cious pretences, usual on such occasions, were resorted to, to gloss over and extenuate the disgraceful negociation. Amongst other things, it was intimated, that Austria was to give up Italy at the general peace ; and especially, that the Venetian power was to be re-established. And, in this manner, through the mingled guile and ferocity exerted on the one hand, and the hardened inveteracy of a depraved appetite on the other, the venerable Venetian Republic"], [51, "VENICE. 15 expired without a groan. A paralysis seized on the whole fabric of her government. No blood was shed, not a wound was inflicted, at her last struggle. The people and the senate were alike benumbed by the force of their terrors ; and, spaniel-like, they fawned at the feet of the Gallic tiger. It was a spectacle at once calculated to excite contempt and pity ; and strikingly evinced the close contiguity that sometimes exists between the two extremes. One tyrant, Attila, the foe to tranquillity and happiness, forced the ancient Heneti, or Veneti, to take refuge in the Lagunes : another tyrant, many centuries after, crushes them in his fiend like embraces. Out of the sensation of alarm, the Venetian power first started ; and, from a similar lapse into consternation, and a supine abandonment of the ordinary resources of a government, it at last fell. Several individuals have, I am aware, been suspected of treachery ; but, imputations of this kind will, I am confident, have no weight with persons accustomed to reflect, and to judge for themselves. Is it at all probable, that the Vene tian Senate, whose boasted policy it uniformly was to invest no individual with extraordinary responsibility, would, at a crisis so momentous, deposit an extreme plenitude of power in the"], [52, "16 VENICE. hands of any particular delegate ? That Buona- parte endeavoured to win over to his side some of the nobles is highly probable ; but, that a single man among them was sincerely his friend, I can never believe. No, no ! the excellent Venetians had no traitors among them, but sluggishness and moral prostration, at a period of considerable excitement in the world of in- tellect, and when the fires of revolution were blazing throughout Europe. Closing their eyes against the impending tempest \u2014 for aVenetian seldom looked into a book \u2014 they were at a loss how to act, when it at length reached their sea-girt city. On the arrival of foreigners at Venice, a voluptuous train of diversions, unaccompanied with any remarkable tokens of manly energy, principally attracted their attention. Had a well-appointed army of brave and faithful Sclavonians \u2014 a race at all times strongly at tached to the Republic \u2014 been kept up and occasionally reviewed ; had but a small sprink ling of the martial elements obtained a footing amidst the Paphian amusements of the city, a far different fate would, in all probability, have befallen the Venetians. Presaging, from the decrepitude of the Re public, and its sluggish aversion to every thing"], [53, "17 VENICE. military, the great Lord Chesterfield foretold, that they would one day become the easy prey of the first armed potentate who should think fit to attack them. When the French Revolu tion broke out, in so degraded a light was the military profession viewed by the Venetians, that \" Signor Ufficiale,\" mister officer, was ac tually a term of reproach and utter contempt. At that period, a noble Venetian would no more think of sending, or of accepting a challenge, than a general would think of having a tilting bout with a subaltern, an admiral with one of his midshipmen, or a member of parliament with his own valet-de-chambre. If an English gen tleman in a crowd had happened to jostle a Venetian Don, and a quarrel ensued, the lat ter, in answer to a challenge, would merely desire the former to go about his business, after calling him \" un' elefanto !\" At present, how ever, things are somewhat different ; and well attested instances are not rare, in which the youthful descendants of the Venetian Peers have displayed a courage and a magnanimity of character, worthy of the best days of the Republic. In all ages, the Venetians have been dis tinguished for an over-cautious policy \u2014 a quality which is necessarily unfriendly to the growth vol. i. c"], [54, "18 VENICE. of true courage. A governor of men may not in aptly be compared to a palafreniere, or groom of the stable. The over-cautious gentry of whom I am speaking resorted too much to ordinances, serving as curbs, snaffles, and bits, which de prived the noble animal of that due portion of mettle, which was actually necessary to render him useful, Not that I am, by any means, an advocate for that rude barbarism, which, after a short effort, sinks back into listlessness ; but rather that Roman union of intellect with moral refinement and intrepidity. As for the stigma cast on the Fine Arts, imputing to them a direct tendency to sensual irregularities, like many other subterfuges of depraved understandings, false in one instance, it is generally erroneous in every other. The subversion of kingdoms is occasioned by vice ; and never by the introduction of the elegant arts, which uniformly tread in the footsteps of nature. No one, possessing a grain of common sense, can be made to believe, that political decline can be compatible with an approxima tion to Nature, every property of which is firm, continuous, and enduring ; \" Unerring Nature, still divinely bright, \" One clear, unchang'd, and universal light !\" But, more of this hereafter."], [55, "19 VENICE. Now, if we turn our view but a few years back, we shall find, that the mighty empire of Austria had so far dwindled before the arms of Napoleon, that Francis condescended to ac knowledge that he held it in vassalage ; thereby retrograding, as it were, at least seventy years. The Corsican compelled him to assume the title of Francis the First; a title which had been already borne by the husband of Maria Theresa, so far back as the year 1745. Although Buonaparte had made numerous Kings, whom he held in a state of abject subjection, Francis was his first Emperor ; and the frail tenure of their power, and their tame submission to the fiat of the Gallic Chief, may be gathered from the far-famed decrees which he issued from Berlin and Milan, ordaining tlie destruction by fire of British merchandize, of whatever des cription, not only immediately throughout his own dominions, but, by implication, in every country dependent upon him. Like the Grand Signior, he had only to send about the silken cord \u2014 the Turk's hint; a sort of Irish insinua tion, not easily to be misunderstood, and which was every where attended to. But, what was the ultimate effect of this measure ? Why this : it in spired Great Britain with redoubled strength ; and accordingly, unaided by the rest of Europe, c 2"], [56, "20 VENICE. single-handed she overturned the plans which had been laid for her destruction ; and, instead of sinking in the tremendous conflict, she over whelmed her opponents, and rose, like another ph\u0153nix, out ofthe ashes. So much for Buonaparte's burning system : the sole effect of which was, to kindle the fire of the British lion. Whenever the French ruler wished to draw money out of the pockets of his subjects \u2014 whose hatred of the English nation he always took especial care to excite \u2014 he had only to say that it was wanted for the purpose of attacking us, and the necessary supplies were immediately forthcoming. So great was the animosity against this country, which at that time rankled in the bosoms of our opposite neighbours! And, that animosity, I am sorry to say, still subsists : \" k cambiato il maestro di capella, ma la musica e sempre quella,\" \u2014 tbe ruler is changed, but the system continues the same. It was, however, the rock on which Napoleon's greatness at last foundered. To British per severance, then, in the contest, do the mo narchs of Europe, yclept \" legitimate,\" owe, in no small degree, their salvation. And, what is the return they have made us ? They have persevered in the prohibitory system, to the great injury of their own subjects. Instead of"], [57, "21 VENICE. conforming themselves to the obligations imposed on regular sovereigns, bound to consult wise counsellors and to adopt salutary laws, they have chosen to walk in the footsteps of a lawless military chief. An inconsistency this, which is past comprehension ! CHAPTER III. VENICE.

Had Buonaparte continued to reign, every vestige of popular commotion would have been obliterated, and every record of revolutionary tumult would have been destroyed. The prisons, of which the world has heard such shocking descriptions, no longer exist. Napoleon had determined never to enter the walls of the same dungeon, in which the unfortunate Louis and his c 3"], [58, "22 VENICE. family had been incarcerated. The prison of the Temple, therefore, has disappeared from the face ofthe earth. At Lyons, too, the ruins occasioned by intestine war have been cleared away, and a magnificent square has been erected on the spot. Many other alterations took place under his direction ; evidently for the purpose of obliterating the remembrance of popular devas- tations, committed during the levelling period which had so recently gone by. Nor are these traces of his ingenuity, as a despot of the most ambitious and selfish description, confined to France alone. Proofs of his determination to work an entire change in the face of things are even more striking in other countries. At Venice, for instance, he caused every symbol of the old regime to be effaced. The Winged Horse of that once famous Republic he ordered to be obliterated, however destructive such re moval might be to architectural symmetry. Selfish and envious, he could not brook a com petitor ; and, wherever he found himself unable to equal or surpass some existing structure, in his headlong rage for singularity and fame, he would tarnish its lustre and deface its beauty. To some of my readers these strictures may appear invidious. But, truth is the guide of my pen ; and, to prove the correctness of my"], [59, "23 VENICE. position, I refer them to the once magnificent Piazza di San Marco, at Venice, which has been totally disfigured by the wing which Na poleon caused to be added thereto, during his occupancy of Italy, no doubt with the ostensible object of completing that square, and of thereby holding himself up as the projector and finisher of public works, which no mortal but himself was capable of setting about. Other instances of his pruriency for undertakings of this sort are to be found in the Louvre, and in the Duomo, or cathedral, of Milan. His completion, how ever, of the opposite wing of the former, and of the facade of the latter, afford but miserable specimens of the taste ofthe French Emperor; or rather, perhaps, the taste of his architect. Buonaparte's Vandalic mutilations at Venice have been sadly repaid to his manes. Not a whit more ofhis marmorean \u2014 lignean \u2014 metallic, constructions, bearing his name, and titles, and personal emblems, are at this moment to be seen in any corner of his once boundless empire, than if \"Napoleon le Grand \" had never existed. Sic transit gloria mundi ! What one man can raise up, another can pull down. God only is omnipotent, and His works eternal. The Romans, in the zenith of their glory, set about every public measure under the \u00e6gis of augury. At c 4,"], [60, "24 VENICE. least, they endeavoured, to the best of their abilities, to find out the exact moment and the precise manner of setting about the undertaking; and the surest test of their sincerity is perhaps to be found, in the success with which their exertions were usually crowned. We know they were occasionally cruel and unjust : but, in their general conduct and character, we dis cover a sincere reverence for the Gods. Of the grandeur, the correct judgment, and the pure taste of the ancient Romans, the best proofs extant, cr those which at least are as good as any other, are the remains of their public edifices ; their forms, the object with which they were erected, and the uses to which they were applied. Now, in the name of common sense, why place a triumphal arch, intended to resemble the memorials, always erected on the public ways, in honour of the Latin victors, in the centre of a square, and under which no one passes? And yet this blunder has Napoleon committed in the Place du Carousel. To build churches, raise palaces, and enact laws, are matters of no rare occurrence. In the con struction of his code, he consulted every man, throughout his vast empire, pretending to the least smattering of jurisprudence. Those who happened to be fond of law, he was determined"], [61, "VENICE. 25 to supply to their very hearts' content. But, if we may form an opinion from the results, no ho nours can be fairly awarded to the Gallic chief. Failing ultimately in all his projects, he. has no claim, as an individual, to the extraordinary political sagacity which has been attributed to him, since his overthrow, by the very persons, probably, who were the most anxious to run down his talents while prosperity every where the attendant of his career. As in his architectural undertakings he srtewed himself a barbarian, so in his schemes of government was he equally unsuccessful. Religion, or the sin cere humiliation of the soul before the Deity, was the subject which he appeared least of all to have understood. After this, that the Na poleon system of ethics should be held up as a model worthy of imitation, and that his policy should be considered the oracle for legislators, are among the most extraordinary signs of the present very extraordinary times ! After the battle of Austerlitz, a suspension of arms was agreed upon ; and a conference was appointed to settle the preliminaries of peace, which immediately followed between the French Emperor and the monarchs of Russia and Prussia. It was agreed, that the place of meet ing between the sovereigns should be a barge,"], [62, "26 VENICE. then lying in the river, at which the three monarchs were to arrive at one and the same time ; not unlike the etiquette which was ob served between Octavius, Lepidus, and Mark Antony, the execrable murderers of the im mortal Cicero. Buonaparte was the first who entered the boat ; but, the Emperor of Russia venturing to take the precedency of the Mame luke, the well-known -constant attendant and saiva guardia of Napoleon, the little man in stantly turned round, and darted one of his Corsican looks at the Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia, intimating that it was his pleasure that this Asiatic slave should enter first. Necessitas non habet legem. There was no retreating. The Monarchs took the hint, and actually followed in the rear of the Mameluke ! For sovereigns who could thus sacrifice their private feelings to the good of their subjects, I am disposed to entertain all due respect ; and I have only recorded the fact, for the sake of shewing the world to what a pitch of degrada tion these royal personages had arrived, pre viously to the conclusion of the wished-for peace. Where, then, is the man who must not rejoice at the downfall of a mountebank upstart, who could so far forget the respect which is ever due to fallen majesty, as to compel those"], [63, "VENICE. 27 sovereigns to follow in the train of a contemp tible slave? After this, what right had Buona parte, when, in consequence of the battle of Waterloo, he was forced to surrender himself to the nation which he had so often stigmatized as a nest of pirates, to expect that any sympathy should be shown towards him ? Truly, the meanness of this man in adversity, was only equalled by his unbounded arrogance in pros perity ! It has been asserted, by those who were in his immediate confidence, that when informed that it was Wellington who had for ever annihilated his power, and not Blucher \u2014 for whom he enter tained a deadly hatred \u2014 tears involuntarily gushed from those eyes, which, unmoved, had beheld the massacre of the poor Venetians at Verona ; the murder of Pichegru, D'Enghien, and Captain Wright ; the arrest of the innocent * * *, who was obliged to flee to Malta ; and the ruinous process against her husband, be cause she would not consent to become a spy upon England, her native country. Had he not been guilty of enormities like these, to gether with the treacherous sale of the Venetian Republic, at the very moment that his army was preserved form starvation by its government; and the barbarous murder, in cold blood, of the"], [64, "28 VENICE. Count Augustin Di Verita and others at Verona; he never would have been doomed, by a gene rous nation, to end his days on the barren rock of St. Helena. True courage is ever magnanimous. In modern times, however, it is too much a mere word, \u2014 vox et pr\u0153terea nihil. The brave man may be conquered, but he will never so far degrade himself as to kiss the feet of his conqueror. Galgacus was never more a prince \u2014 and a British prince, too \u2014 than when he was standing in chains before the Roman Emperor. To return, however, to the Sovereigns. It is impossible to divest one's-self of the conviction, that it is to the timidity of their ministers, and not to the peril of enterprize \u2014 to their narrow minded policy, and not to the extensiveness of their views \u2014 that we are to attribute the warlike aspect which Europe will most likely shortly be obliged to assume, from their neutral conduct towards the infidel oppressors of Greek civili zation and of the Christian religion, as well as their unrighteous interference against the praise worthy Spaniards; who, actuated by far different principles, have won over the majority of civi lized nations to their interest. For the very sub jects of those Sovereigns, who are now actually engaged in suppressing national liberty and in-"], [65, "VENICE. 29 dependence, will themselves one day step for ward, to assist in the general emancipation from human slavery. At once ignorant, bigotted, feeble, and in continual dread of the natural progress of free dom, the mis-named Holy Alliance are combin ing \u2014 most un-holily and most sacrilegiously \u2014 to effect the overthrow of all liberal thinking. Impolitically fancying, that a state of freedom is incompatible with the safety of their thrones, they are for strangling the infant in its cradle; well aware that they would hereafter be obliged to crouch to its manhood. But liberty, like wisdom, proceeding from the head of the Thunderer, comes forth arrayed cap a. pied. Her power is irresistible ; her influence univer sal. Her voice, therefore, will be heard, and her dictates obeyed ; when the short-sighted and narrow-minded mortals who would arraign her at the bar of despotic prejudices shall have sunk into oblivion, or be only recollected with sensations of pity and contempt. The necessity which exists for a full partici pation in the enjoyment of that inestimable blessing, will strikingly appear, from a faithful detail of proceedings which have, from the foolish and mistaken policy of its several go vernments, been carrying on against the free-"], [66, "30 VENICE. born subjects of Italy, and, in particular, against the Venetians. Her peculiar position, and fourteen years of uninterrupted experience, sufficiently shew, that Venice can alone be prosperous, under a government congenial to her soil and local si tuation. Nor can she prove of any, but of tem porary and fleeting advantage, to the barbarism ofthe usurper, who would batten on the spoils of native genius, to the total extinguishment ofthe immortal motives, which gave birth to her pri mitive attachment to liberty and independence. It is well known, that seeds which are prolific in one soil, often turn out unproductive when sown in another. So it is with governments. That which is best calculated for the happiness of one race of men, may prove altogether un friendly to the well-being of another. The prosperity of a country may depend, as much on the disposition of its inhabitants, as on the wisdom of its laws ; which must be adapted to the climate, the soil, and the general habits of the people who are to be governed by them. Now, the Venetians differ as widely in dis position, in manners, and in customs, from every other race of beings, as the element on which their city stands differs from the air. They may be compared to that sagacious creature, the"], [67, "31 VENICE. amphibious beaver. The policy which ever governed their intercourse with neighbouring and foreign nations, far exceeds the policy which generally actuates statesmen. Those who have had the opportunity of attentively observing, or inquiring into, the conduct of this very extraordinary people, will acknowledge that my description of them is not exaggerated, and proceeds from careful observation, during a long residence in the country, and from that free and unrestrained intercourse with every class of its inhabitants, from which alone ge nuine experience can be acquired. In my humble opinion, the first considerations of a government bearing sway over a newly acquired territory, ought to be directed to the general character of its people, as well as to its soil, climate, and element; by an attention to which, much care and inconvenience would be avoided by its governors, and an incalculable degree of dissatisfaction and irritation would be spared to the people about to be governed. Is there on earth a law which justifies, either the aggressions which have been made on Ita lian independence, with the connivance of the Holy Alliance, or the more recent conduct of France towards Spain ? It requires neither the aid of a microscope, nor the wisdom of a Plato,"], [68, "32 VENICE. nor the sagacity of a British statesman of the old school, to discover, that when the Austrians crossed the Po, to take an unprincipled posses sion of Naples, they had, both in their rear and flank, their most powerful enemies ; and that, had the Neapolitans been commanded by men, instead of automata, they would have given them sufficient occupation. Genoa and Piedmont had declared themselves in favour of the same cause ; and the Milanese only waited for a favourable movement, to join against the common enemy. If Austria had been so far worsted as to have been under the necessity of adding another to her numerous retrograde movements, the emancipation of Italy would have been ensured, and the total des truction of the invading army would have been the consequence. As my work is of a miscellaneous description, that I may not fatigue the reader with too long a detail of the transactions which distinguish, as much as they disgrace, the nineteenth century, let me here withdraw his attention, for a moment, from the melancholy narrative, and introduce a short fable, which will be found extremely ap plicable to a certain event which has taken place in the American seas, at the instigation of one of the Northern powers ; and the proceeding"], [69, "33 VENICE. which will, most probably, take place on the part of other branches ofthe Holy Alliance. An old rat, who had long been on the watch for the unpacking of a case of provisions, which she intended to appropriate to her own use, summoned together a congress of voracious animals of her own kidney. Being assembled, she harangued them most philanthropically, and expressed her unbounded zeal for tlie general welfare. She solemnly assured them, that she entertained no selfish wish to partici pate in the common spoils, but was solely anxious to co-operate in bringing about such a reform as the times demanded ; and that, such being the case, she should withdraw from the busy world, and claim no more, for her share, than what was barely necessary to supply the cravings of nature. Having concluded her harangue, she retired. One of the conclave, however, less credulous than the rest, followed on tip-toe tlie disinterested member of the long tailed sisterhood ; when, lo ! instead of putting in practice her boasted moderation, she was found snugly nestled in the middle of a huge Westphalia ham ! I leave my reader to draw his own inference ; only observing, that Russian rats are reported to have an amazing attachment to Indian crackers ; Austrian rats to Swiss gru- vol.

To return to the present condition of Venice, and her miserable inhabitants. No people in Europe groan under a weightier load of oppres sion than the Venetians. The laws by which they are governed are little understood, either by Plenzit, the soi-disant Solon, who framed them, or by those whose duty it is to put them in execution. From the many contradictions with which they abound, and their innumerable violations of common law and common sense, I"], [71, "35 VENICE. have been informed, that the gentlemen of the bar, Germans as well as Italians, waited upon the great lawgiver previously to their being acted upon, and solicited of him, for their own guidance, an explanation of the numerous ob scure and equivocal clauses in which they abounded. The only answer they could obtain from the modern Lycurgus was \u2014 \" I have drawn up this code of laws. Apply but yourselves to the study of them, and their intent and meaning will become abundantly apparent.\" This sagacious reply recals to my recollec tion a certain action, which was tried, some years ago, before the famous Lord Mansfield, respecting some cockets. These same cockets were found to be written in so miserable a hand, that his Lordship directed the writer of them to be sent for. When he appeared in court, the learned Judge asked him, whether he was actually the writer of these cockets? \" Yes, please your Lordship,\" said the man. \" Then,\" replied the Judge, *' they are so illegible, that I have sent for you to explain them.\" \u2014 \" I am aware of that,\" rejoined the scribe; \"but I am only a writer of cockets, my Lord, not a reader of them.\" So, like this sagacious cocket-writer, hasPlenzit left his laws unexplained and unintelligible \u2014 doubtless for the more speedy redress and con- d2"], [72, "36 VENICE. solation of the poor unfortunate Venetians, who are to be nurtured with the pith and marrow of these precious legislative enactments ! This mutilator of the jurisprudence of the immortal Justinian has been heard to declare, that he could discover nothing in the Institutes of that great man in the least worthy of being re tained. This declaration of Mr. Solon Plenzit reminds me of those gothic barbarians of the present enlightened age, who modestly undertake to improve and render more perfect the writings of our divine Shakespeare ; and who, the better to avoid a comparison of his immortal verses with their own vapid and disjointed trash, shrewdly take care, when they set about me tamorphosing one of his matchless plays into a senseless and despicable opera, to expunge the entire of the original. I have often won dered, that these impudent transformers of sterling comedies into miserable burlettas, should never, in their \" sway of vanity,\" have fancied themselves qualified to fill the role allot ted to the primo buffo. In Venice, and throughout the Venetian States, all criminal proceedings are entirely carried on in writing : so that a man may be accused, tried, condemned, and even executed,"], [73, "37 VENICE. without ever beuolding the face of his judge, or being confronted with his accusers. Many of these judges are totally ignorant, not merely of the jurisprudence, but even of the language of Italy ; it being the practice at Vienna, when any one of the clod-hopping gentry from the Tyrole happens to come to the capital and be out of employ, though he may even have been a cobler, to transform him, presto, into a judge, and dispatch him, in that capacity, to Venice. If, perchance, the man happens to be honest, his appearance belies his character : for he has more the semblance of a culprit than the pre sident ofa court of judicature. This, however, is a misfortune, and not a crime ; and is, be sides, of no great consequence ; seeing that these Austrian dispensers of the law, like those of the Areopagus at Athens, never behold the object of their deliberations.* * In the early days ofthe Grecian Republic, the character of its inhabitants was so strictly moral, that when the vices of a malefactor became publicly exposed, he showed such a sense of his past errors, as to excite the compassion of the judges to such a degree, as often to defeat the ends of justice. In order to prevent this, when the increased riches and popu lation of the Republic increased the number of crimes, it was decreed, that in all criminal trials, a curtain should be drawn to separate the one from the other. The custom existed in Athens in the time of Demosthenes. D 3"], [74, "38 VENICE. The civil proceedings in the Venetian States are now superintended by a president of the tribunal, who has eight magistrates under his direction. The cases are all forwarded to him ; and it is his duty to distribute them to these different judges, who are bound never to decide on any case, unless five out of the eight should be present : the number, however, very often does not extend beyond three. These men act in the treble capacity of advocate, judge, and juror. No counsel are permitted to argue the case pro or con; and the mischief is, that these judges often come into court without having made themselves acquainted with their briefs. Many of them, as I before hinted, are actually Germans, Hungarians, or Bohemians, who have been sent to the Venetian States, entirely ig- norant of the language, manners, and customs of the people, amongst whom it is their duty faithfully to dispense law and justice. Dispatch of business depends, therefore, more on the appetites of these gentry, than on their industry or sense of duty : for the reader will agree with me, that it would be most unreasonable to expect, that a German Judge should forego his dinner, for the sake of a paltry Italian law-suit ! There is, it is true, a Court of Appeal, as it is called. But then, this court is too polite and"], [75, "VENICE. 39 too well-bred to disturb a former decision ; and therefore it makes an uniform practice never to impugn, but invariably to confirm, all previous judgments \u2014 unless, indeed, certain weighty ar guments should induce them to interpose ! The wealthy dient has it constantly in his power to induce his judges to hasten or pro crastinate their decision, according to the quan tity and quality of the metal which is thrown into the scale, for the purpose of counteracting the workings of conscience, and securing a favourable verdict : it being a well established fact, that solid reasons of this description have never been \"adduced, without operating the de sired effect. And, certainly, when we consider how wretchedly these men are paid by the Austrian government \u2014 if we could possibly ima gine an excuse for taking a bribe for the mal administration of justice, it would be in the case of these long-eared judges. But, besides this, the greatest abuses take place, from the length of time which is suffered to intervene between the sentence of the court and its final execu tion ; by which delay, even this mockery and mere show of justice is defeated, from the oppor tunity of concealing, or of making away with his effects, which it affords to the fraudulent debtor. By the laws of Austria, no landlord can turn d 4"], [76, "40 VENICE. his tenants away from his estate, but by a three years' notice to quit, though those tenants may be in arrears to him for rent, and are known to be in the practice of embezzling the produce, to the injury, and even utter ruin of the pro prietor ; since, from the non-payment of his tenant, he is unable to make good his own taxes. The government, however, enforces immediate payment from the landlord, by selling his effects for about a third of their real value ; though, by law, they ought not to be disposed of under less than two-thirds. But the time between the seizure and the actual sale is extremely short. The greedy speculator on human misery takes, therefore, every advantage ; whilst the agents of government, anxious to transmit to the Austrian treasury all the revenue they can possibly collect, sell the property for whatever it will fetch, rather than retain it ; lest a fall in the price of the produce should render it still less valuable. In this way have thousands of the best patrician families, as well as many of the most respectable private citizens of Venice, been utterly ruined; though some of them have actually been, at the time, creditors of the Aus trian government to a considerable amount, for arrears of principal and interest of money which they had lent to it ! . '"], [77, "VENICE. 41 When these distressing circumstances take place, the unhappy creditors apply, very natu rally, to the government, for a liquidation of the debt due to them, to prevent the seizure and sacrifice of their property. In case the govern ment should not be prepared to advance the whole, or any part of the money it had bor rowed, they at least implore it to strike a balance. To which the humble supplicant re ceives the consoling answer \u2014 solve aut arepit ! Under the Austrian sway at Venice, the public taxes are usually rented out by the go vernment to a sort of middle men \u2014 a class of persons, destitute alike of character and of pro perty ; but who, from the enormous exactions which the government allows them to inflict on the unfortunate creatures, who, from the causes I have just mentioned, and the low price of agricultural produce, may not be prepared to make good their payments \u2014 are enabled to give extravagant premiums to individuals who hap pen to possess unincumbered landed property ; which property, for these considerations, they pledge to the government, in the way of gua rantee for the punctuality of these tax col lectors. As these villainous middle men are in the practice of holding out exorbitant premiums of"], [78, "42 VENICE. thirty or forty per cent., many a credulous no bleman has fallen a victim to his own avarice, and has thereby lost the whole of his substance : for, at the expiration of eight days from the time fixed for the paying in of these taxes to the public treasury, the government seizes upon the estates of the unhappy guarantee, and dis poses of them, without loss of time, to the best bidder. Some of these tax-gatherers have taken to their heels, when they have found themselves unable to collect a sufficient sum, before the expiration of the two months allowed for the payments. Others have contrived to make good their engagements by the following device : the wretched farmers, and landed proprietors, when their estates are seized on for arrears of taxes, in order to obtain a suspension, or indul gence, for a short time, are glad to make great sacrifices to the local authorities, both in money and effects ; besides giving their land and its produce, by way of security for the due fulfil ment of the exorbitant engagement. This in dulgence they are under the necessity of renew ing every eight or ten days, making every time some fresh sacrifice. And, when at length these local authorities, who are in league with the tax-collectors, discover that they can no"], [79, "43 VENICE. longer spunge upon the unhappy victims of cupidity, they dispose of their effects at a mock auction, for a twelfth of their value \u2014 become themselves, under fictitious names, the actual purchasers \u2014 sell them again for their real value \u2014 fix the credulous proprietor with the gua rantee to government \u2014 and, finally, decamp with the plunder ! When my reader considers, that agricultural produce does not at present fetch, throughout the Venetian States, more than a tenth part of its former price, he will at once see, that it is morally as well as physically impossible foi; the people to pay the present enormous amount of taxes. They are, nevertheless, now called upon, when the sack of corn of four bushels sells for only seven francs, to pay as much as they were called upon to pay when the same quantity sold for fifty francs. Every other commodity bears the same proportion : for, throughout Italy, corn is the standard by which the price of every article is regulated, and consequently rises or falls. But, though there is now this astonishing difference, the government has hitherto turned a deaf ear to the heart-rending complaints of its miserable subjects. \u25a0 At Venice, the currency chiefly consists of a base metal, with which the government pays"], [80, "44 VENICE. both its civil and military servants : nevertheless, it will only take to the extent of a third part of the public taxes in this almost valueless coin ; the other two-thirds it insists upon receiving in gold. And, as the revenue is collected every two months, genuine specie is become a regular article of speculation, and, at these stated periods, is with difficulty to be procured at any rate ; for those who are employed in collecting the taxes, make a point of monopolizing, every two months, all the national money. Against this there is no remedy. The decrees of the government are rigidly enforced ; and in case the good currency is not forthcoming, the de faulter has an additional five per cent, added to the two-thirds of the taxes which should have been paid in sterling gold. This is the first instance, I believe, of any government depreciating its credit, by thus dis gracefully refusing to take back its own de based circulating medium, in payment of taxes. Heaven grant it may be the last ! for it is cer tainly a practice \" More honour'd in the breach, than in th' observance.\""], [81, "45 CHAPTER V. VENICE. General Character of the Venetians Males Females State qf Society Casinos Marriages Dress of the Nobles in the time of the Republic Gondolas Treatment qf the Meretrices The Free-Masons' Lodge suppressed. Generally speaking, the Venetians are gentle, affable, polite, courteous, hospitable, and more civilized and better informed than the inhabi tants of any other part of Italy. Their conver sation is at once entertaining and instructive. The vast number of men of talent, in every art and science, to which the Republic has given birth, is a proof that its lakes are as abundant in genius, as they are fertile in the productions of their native element. To mention only a few of the illustrious names1 who have rendered the Venetian nation immortal \u2014 Titus Livius, Pe trarca, Trissino,* Algarotti, Goldoni, Titian, * Voltaire acknowledges, that it was the perusal of the writings of this great Venetian dramatist, that first induced him to set about the greater part of his theatrical produc tions ; and especially his \" Sofonisbe,\" which is little more than a copy of the Italian, adapted to the French stage."], [82, "46 VENICE. Tintoretto, Paul Veronese, Palladio, Sansovino, Scarlati, Buranello, Bertoni, Tartini, Canova, &c. are names which, in their respective de partments, remain unrivalled, and will be the admiration of the world, as long as mankind shall continue to entertain a taste for science and the fine arts. As navigators, the Venetians claim the foremost rank ; as warriors, they stand on an equality with the bravest ; and as politicians, they are superior to every other civilized nation in Europe. The men are above the middle stature, rather inclined to be tall, and remarkably well made. They have good clear complexions, fine ex pressive countenances, with an elegant and easy deportment. So remarkably constant are they in their attachments, that it is no uncommon thing to hear of friendships, between the sexes, of fifty and sixty years' standing. A Venetian rarely abandons the object of his primitive affec tion, except for ill-treatment or infidelity ; and, even in those instances, he never fails to lend her his assistance, should she happen to stand in need of it. The females, who, generally speaking, are handsome, have very fine figures, with beauti fully clear skins, expressive features, and eyes that penetrate the inmost recesses of the soul."], [83, "VENICE. 47 They are interestingly delicate in their external manners and in their language ; the Venetian being, of all the dialects of Italy, the most agreeable. In the mouth of a genteel Donna Veneziana, it adds to the native grace of her carriage, and never fails to charm and delight the ear ofa stranger ; especially when it happens to be placed in contrast with the vulgar Lom bardian jargon. They are remarkably attentive to foreigners ; though they rarely form a tender attachment for them. When, however, such an attachment does take place, it is usually most passionate and sincere. The societies at Venice, whether at private houses or at the public casinos, are generally enlivened with the smiling eyes, and gentle and fascinating looks of the fair sex, and are con ducted with an elegance and an ease superior to most other female societies ; and without any of that discordant rivalship of prerogatives, too often to be met with elsewhere. The casinos are conducted much in the same man ner as the subscription houses in London ; where the members are at liberty to do as they please ; with this especial difference, that the ladies only are subscribers, the gentlemen being honorary members. Strangers of respectability, of both sexes, are readily admitted, and meet"], [84, "48 VENICE. with a polite and affable reception. The com pany are entertained with a concert, and treated with refreshments. Cards are introduced at the wish of any of the party ; and other amuse ments, except those of hazard. These casinos are furnished in the most costly and elegant style, and are brilliantly lighted up with the beautiful wax candles for which Venice is so justly celebrated. The regularity, the order, and the magnifi cence which prevail at these princely casinos, at once discover the ladies of Venice to be a superior race of beings to their neighbours of the Terra Firma. In their conversation they are lively and unaffected without levity, and com municative and affable without coquetry. The uncommon share of freedom which these ladies enjoy, induces foreigners, who have but a superficial knowledge of them, to form an opinion of them very different from that which they really deserve. My observations, of course, apply solely to good society. The mixed classes of every country have their chia.ro scuro. The Venetian ladies are extremely engaging in their manners ; and as to their dress, it may be called becoming rather than fashionable, and sets off their fine figures to the greatest advan tage. It is not unusual for them to be married"], [85, "49 VENICE. to men whom they have never before seen, except through the grate of the convent in which they have been educated, and which they only quit to enter into the gay world, through the temple of Flymen \u2014 where Cupid rarely presides, beyond the honey-moon ! And, to this very liberty, which they enjoy the moment they are married, is it to be ascribed, that they are usually not so capricious as the Italians of the south, who are more rigorously subjected to antiquated external formalities. If the experience of twenty years, obtained by a residence amongst, and a constant inter course with, the highest orders of society, can justify me in hazarding an opinion, I may ven ture to pronounce the ladies of Venice worthy of our best esteem. There is a wide difference between an easy, unrestrained carriage, and that looseness of conduct, which is but too apt to be confounded with it. At one period, the Venetians were so sus picious of their wives and daughters, that they never allowed them to walk out ; and, to pre vent their doing so, they even obliged them to wear exceedingly high-heeled shoes, which, as it were, suspended the foot from the toe up wards, raising the other extremity nearly ten inches, and making it almost parallel with the VOL. I. E"], [86, "50 VENICE. leg ; in consequence of which, their feet became cramped like those of the Chinese. Some of these shoes I have often seen, in the palace of the truly estimable Madame Damula Pisani. The usual dresses of the noble Venetians, in the time of the Republic, somewhat resembled the black gowns worn by our judges, having ermine on one side. The robes of ceremony were of crimson damask, very long ; and they were habited in full-powdered wigs, like those worn by the gentlemen of the bar. This was the usual dress of the Doge ; except on special occasions, when he wore one made of gold brocade, with a massy gold chain round his neck, and a coronet on his head of the same materials, over a wig and velvet cap. The dress of the noble ladies was a rich black velvet, according to the season, a skirt with a long train, a coloured body and sleeves, and a black silk veil that covered the head and shoulders, was crossed on the neck and round the waist, and fell tastefully behind on the black skirt. It was generally trimmed with black lace, and was very becoming when pro perly put on. Under the veil they wore a ske leton wire shape, to keep it from falling on the face, which was called vesta e sendal. Foreigners generally adopted this dress on their arrival at"], [87, "VENICE. 51 Venice : but few could put them on so tastily as the natives. I recollect that Madame Mara, when singing at Venice, always wore this dress during the morning ; and she was accustomed to say, that she never pleased her auditors more than when she was thus attired. In church, at mass, and at all public places, the ladies wore this dress. During the time of the Carnival, they could never go to the theatre or opera without the tabbara e bauta : which was a long cloak of black or coloured silk, with a black silk cap, and a laced trimming placed round, nearly a yard in length, which fell over the shoulders half way down their figures. Over their faces they wore a mask, and on their heads a man's three-cornered hat, ornamented with feathers and a cockade. But, the moment they reached their boxes, the cap and mask were taken off, until they left the opera ; when they were immediately replaced, until they had passed to their gondolas. This dress, together with the mask, were worn during Carnival time, the feast of the Ascension, and at some other public festivals ; which, alto gether, occupied nearly six months out of the twelve ; and only at these seasons, and in this dress, were they permitted to hold converse with the coi-ps diplomatique resident at Venice. e 2"], [88, "52 VENICE. The gondolas were all painted black, and highly varnished. In the middle of this elegant little vessel is a cushioned bench, for two per sons ; and on each side there is another, suffi cient to hold one person. The tilt, or awning, resembles a hearse, with windows and Venetian blinds. The outer part is covered with black cloth, trimmed with tassels ; the inner with silk ; and a curtain, of the same materials as the out side, serves as a door of entrance. The gon dolas of the foreign ministers, and of other dis tinguished personages, had generally coloured silk curtains, by which they could always be distinguished from those of the Venetians. After the conquest of the Greek Islands, Con stantinople, Cyprus, Candia, and the Morea, by the Republic, from the vast influx of wealth and luxury, and the great increase of population from the Terra Firma, it became necessary, in order to preserve virtuous females from violence, to allot \u2014 in imitation of the ancient Romans \u2014 a certain retired part of the city, for the habita tions of the improperly called Meretrices : and, to prevent those dreadful evils, for which two great cities were once destroyed by fire, the Senators would walk, in the public square of St. Mark, by the side of these necessary evils ; who, at the approach of evening, were required"], [89, "53 VENICE. to exhibit themselves between two lighted can dles, at the windows of their apartments. Under the present government, the frail sisterhood are licensed, and pay a regular tax ; and are per mitted to follow their profession \u2014pro bono pub lico \u2014 wherever they think fit. A considerable number of the casinos belong exclusively to the gentlemen. The principal ones are \u2014 II casino dei Nobili, il casino dei Mercanti, il casino degl' Avocati, il casino dei Literati, il casino detto Cento, il casino dei Filosofi, il casino Filo-dramatico, il casino Eu terpiano, il casino dei Vecchij, il casino Fil armonico, il casino dei Consoli, &c. The Free mason's Lodge has been put down, and all who were members thereof have been deprived of their employments, and declared incapable of holding any office under the Austrian govern ment. Many a worthy man has, in this way, been deprived of his situation, without being guilty of any crime. Surely the punishment greatly exceeds the offence ! But, the notions of \"princes and of individuals differ widely as to these matters. The former adduce the irre sistible argument \u2014 du plus fort: the latter are consoled by the reflection, that there is a Prince of princes, and that the day of retribution, sooner or later, will assuredly arrive. e 3"], [90, "54 CHAPTER VI.

If, under the Venetian code of legislation, justice, in some instances, happened not to be obtained, it certainly was not the fault either of the judges or of the tribunals ; for every branch thereof was portioned out to different members, who occupied themselves with the civil and criminal departments, the local and external police, &c. All the tribunals, the upper as well as the lower, were exclusively presided over by the nobles, assisted in their jurisdictions by citizens who had been educated for the bar. My reader may form some idea of the multi plicity of the tribunals at Venice, when I tell him that they exceeded those of Paris. First, there was the tribunal appointed to settle all disputes relating to matters of property, and to houses within the city and the neighbouring"], [91, "55 VENICE. islands. Secondly : there was the petty tribunal of the Procurators which decided on disputes relating to property in the Terra Firma, the guardianship of children, marriage contracts, &c. Thirdly : the tribunal which settled all differences subsisting between the inhabitants of Venice and foreigners. Fourthly : the tribunal for contested bills of exchange and promissory notes. Fifthly : the tribunal for deciding upon the value of household furniture, and overcharges. Sixthly : the tribunal whose duty it was to super intend the making and repairing of the streets. Seventhly : the Pioveggi, who revised contracts, and settled the rate of interest to be paid for money borrowed. Eighthly: the tribunal whose duty it was to appoint agents, previously to the seizure and sale of property, and empowering those agents to put in execution the sentences of the other tribunals. Ninthly : the tribunal foi examining into the right of public officers to make seizures ; for putting its seal on property adjudged to be sold or alienated ; legacies and donations by persons dying intestate, &c. Tenthly : there were the Prefetti degli Voti, or tribunal for seeing into the due collection of the taxes, and the expenses of the several tri bunals. The disputes that happened to arise between masters and servants, were confided to e 4"], [92, "56 VENICE. separate officers and magistrates. I have en tered into this detail, merely to justify what I have asserted, with respect to the multiplicity ofthe Venetian tribunals. The Venetian dialect was the only language allowed to be used in all public pleadings, written or oral, whether carried on at the bar or in the senate, as well as in all affairs of state. The solicitors and counsel, as well as every in dividual in their employ, were citizens of Venice, and were held in consideration as men of a certain rank, in all the civilized cities of Europe-; so that the profession formed a source of great wealth, to those who distinguished themselves, by devoting their talents to the service of the public. Many of these lawyers, and especially those who united the talent of pubhc pleading to that of giving consultations in private, made immense fortunes, and died possessed of much personal as well as landed property. In strength of argument, in skill, and in beauty of diction, these gentlemen were not inferior to the orators of antient Greece or Rome ; and greatly superior, in point of elo quence, to those of any other country ; more especially in their criminal pleadings, which took place in open court. The counsel for the Republic was always one of the Avogadori,"], [93, "57 VENICE. who opened the case against the person accused, and founded his accusations upon the facts proved. He was replied to by the counsel for the prisoner ; and, whenever his circumstances did not enable him to retain counsel, some one was always found to defend him, from among the College of Advocates, supported by the Re public for that purpose. It was usual to produce every thing relating to the circumstances ofthe trial in court \u2014 such as pistols, swords, and weapons of every descrip tion ; and both the accuser and accused were accompanied to the court by their relatives and friends : a custom which also prevailed, in similar cases, in the antient tribunals of Greece and Rome. If this popular mode of adjudging criminal matters has been abolished in many of the northern nations, it has principally arisen from the preponderance of ecclesiastical influence ; seeing that canonical institutions, that is to say, those that were devised by the Popes for the Inquisition, were more familiar to the people, than any other legal mode of proceeding by the laity. Two principal events deprived the Venetians of the vast commercial advantages, which, for centuries, they exclusively enjoyed, until they"], [94, "58 VENICE. became divided with other trading nations : first, the discovery ofthe Cape of Good Hope ; and, secondly, the interdiction ofthe nobles, by the senate, from engaging in mercantile con cerns. Until then, Venice possessed the trade of the Indies by Alexandria and the Red Sea, and was the entrepot of all Europe and Asia. Their commercial contemporaries were the Pisanese and the Genoese; who supplied the world with all those articles of merchandize which have since been shared between England, Holland, France, and other nations. The com merce which they carried on was the more honourable, since it was conducted by the first nobles of the state, who were governed by the same generous and noble spirit that actuated the Republic, in their wars, their conquests, and their treaties. \" Venezia la Ricca,\" the once beautiful, opu lent, and unrivalled Queen of the Sea, has, alas ! long since been politically blotted, as a capital, out ofthe map of Europe, having been sacrificed to Austrian cupidity, by the perfidious policy of Buonaparte. That single act \u2014 that one atrocious deed \u2014 independently of the murder of the Duke D'Enghien, and of so many other crimes of the same stamp \u2014 was alone sufficient to have called down upon his head that Divine"], [95, "VENICE. 59 vengeance, which never fails to overtake the miscreant who dares to contemn His sacred com mands. And, what crime, I ask, can be more truly sacrilegious, than the treacherously betray ing an unoffending, a confiding, and an unsus pecting people to bondage under a foreign yoke? The Venetian states, with Istria, Dalmatia, and the Milanese, under the mock title of a separate kingdom, form the gigantic boundaries of Austrian direct preponderancy ; indepen dently of the influence which she indirectly assumes over the entire of Italy. There is not, in fact, a foot of land from Savoy, including Sardinia and Sicily, throughout this, the finest, the richest, the most populous and most civi lized part of Europe, over which the Austrian does not possess either an immediate or a family interest \u2014 to the incalculable prejudice of the general commerce of the rest of Europe, now struggling for emancipation, and endeavouring to establish a just equalization. To preserve such an equilibrium has, since the destruction of the Roman empire, been ever the policy of Europe ; and the general safety requires, that Italy should be divided into twelve small states and governments. Of these separate governments, Venice and Genoa were"], [96, "60 VENICE. ever the most happy, and the most flourishing. And yet, there are mortals to be found, who have the effrontery to hold forth in praise of the new system of spoliation and aggrandize ment ! I, nevertheless, venture fearlessly to assert \u2014 and the assertion is the result of a many years' intercourse, in Italy, with men of sound judgment and great sagacity \u2014 that these short sighted politicians will never behold the restora tion of general tranquillity in Europe, unless Italy \u2014 if not united into a kingdom, like France, Spain, England, Portugal, and other nations \u2014 be again divided into separate governments, as it was before the breaking out of the French revolution. I challenge the Sovereigns of Europe to shew any sufficient cause why nations, like individuals in a court of justice, should not be permitted to enforce the validity of their claim to indepen dence. Can you, England, who so sensibly feel the blessings of that envied constitution, which secures to you your native rights, and the enjoyment of which rights you are gene rously endeavouring to extend even to the savage \u2014 can you, I ask, continue any longer insensible to the degraded situation, the intole rable sufferings, of the people of Genoa and Venice ? If you did not betray them by the"], [97, "61 VENICE. false protestations of your commissioners, you at least flattered them with the hopes, that they should be restored to their lost liberty and in dependence. At any rate, your respectable military commanders not only declared that they were authorized to guarantee those in valuable blessings, but went so far as to pro mise the people, that they should be protected by the British, in the possession of their antient, or of any other form of government, which they might consider most conducive to their own happiness. Mieux tard que jamais ! It is not yet too late. And, for the honour of my beloved England, I cannot help indulging a hope that, compromised as she thus is, in the eyes of all Europe, in the natural degradation that must ensue, from the continuance of the present system, she will no longer continue quiescent. Let me also hope, as I before took occasion to observe, that our philanthropists will not confine themselves to the emancipation of the Blacks, but that they will lend their ready assistance in redeeming the five-and-twenty millions of White Christian slaves \u2014 Greeks and Italians \u2014 now groaning beneath the yoke of foreign oppression. Before I quit this part of my subject, allow me to make one observation. Shakespeare has told us, that \" sweet are the uses of adversity ;\""], [98, "62 VENICE. and I believe it to be strictly true, that the school of affliction proves a school of wisdom, to all classes of human beings \u2014 princes and crowned heads excepted ! For, it is a melan- choly fact, that, notwithstanding the long exile of the Sovereigns of Italy, in islands compara- tively rude and uncultivated, and notwithstand- ing their almost miraculous return to their own beautiful dominions, they have brought back with them the same prejudices, the same ar- bitrary notions, and the same religious bigotry, which formerly distinguished all their actions, and to which may alone be attributed the anni- hilation of their authority, and the present restless condition of their unhappy subjects. CHAPTER VII. VENICE. Niggardly Conduct ofthe Austrian Authorities in Venice Treatment qf the Family qf Solari Anecdote of Murat The Venetian Bernabotti described Venetian No bility Libro d'Oro Prerogatives ofthe Aristocracy The Quaranta. The low, niggardly, base, and parsimonious conduct of the Austrian authorities in Italy, is"], [99, "VENICE. 63 as disgraceful as it is incredible ; as disgusting as it is injurious to their own interests. Whither is fled the noble spirit of Maria Theresa, of Joseph the Second, and of their truly great minded and princely minister, Kaunitz ? It is an easy matter to censure : I will, therefore, adduce facts, in proof of the truth of my assertion. At the period when the mad-brained Murat invaded the north of Italy, the Marquis Pietro Solari, on his return from Rome with despatches for the Austrian Government, was waylaid by that sanguinary adventurer, and wantonly mur dered between Ferrara and Rovigo, within a stone's throw of his brother Jerome's estate, merely to obtain possession of his despatches. The Marquis had been three-and-forty years ist the service. Two of his brothers had fallen gloriously in the field of battle, under Joseph the Second and Leopold ; and many other members of this antient and noble house \u2014 which dates its origin from the great families of Mala Testa, hundreds of years before Counts of Hopsburg, from whom the present imperial family descends, were heard of \u2014 for the space of four centuries had shewn their attachment to the House of Austria ; and, for their signal achievements were raised, by Joseph the First, to the rank of his Austrian and German nobility,"], [100, "64 VENICE. and permitted to surmount their own arms with the imperial coronet. Yet, notwithstanding all these strong claims, such was the unparalleled avarice of the Austrian Government, and such its neglect of this loyal and meritorious family, that the perpetrators of this foul murder have never been brought to justice ; although there is every reason to believe, that the postilion was accessary to the sanguinary deed. The relatives of the noble victim, finding that no steps had been taken by the Government to bring the perpetrators of the murder to justice, applied personally to Vani, the head of the police at Venice ; who gave them the following answer: \u2014 \"Gentlemen, the government will not reward the Sbirri for the apprehension of assassins ; and I myself am so wretchedly paid, that I cannot afford to do it at my own expense. Under the former government, if I happened to have occasion for twenty or thirty extra hands for an affair of importance, I was not only paid for it, but thanked for my zeal and activity -, whereas, the present Government would not only refuse to defray the expenses, but dismiss me for having done my duty. Had this happened under our lost Republic, the perpetrators would have been \"brought to justice, and the family of the unfortunate nobleman"], [101, "65 VENICE. would have been rewarded for his long services, and their irreparable loss. But \u2014 tempora mu tantur /\" Yes ! the times are indeed changed. The conduct of the Venetian Republic was in truth paternal, magnanimous, and generous towards all its subjects \u2014 especially towards those engaged in its service, and towards its poor. As I have had occasion to introduce the name of Murat, I will here state, that I have been credibly informed, by one of his nearest rela tions, that he never would have entertained the project of invading the north of Italy, or of making war against Austria, if he had not received the strongest assurances, that, the moment he took the field, he would have the assistance of Great Britain. It is, however, most probable, that his real motive, in making this move towards the north, proceeded solely from a desire of exciting the alarms of Austria for the safety of her own possessions in Italy, and thereby disabling her from assisting the Bourbons, in preventing Napoleon from recover ing the diadem of France. The much talked-of Venetian Eernabotti, who take their name from having once lived, from motives of frugality, in a remote quarter of the city, called San Barnaba, are the descen- VOL. I. F"], [102, "66 VENICE. dants of some of the first inhabitants of the Adriatic islands. All of them are ancient pa tricians, who, from misfortunes and a train of unforeseen events, have been reduced to the lowest pitch of indigence. To prevent, how ever, their being driven to the dire necessity of begging in the public streets, or of being em ployed in menial occupations, which might re flect disgrace on the descendants of the founders of its liberty and independence, the Republic kindly thought fit to make ample provision, in their various religious and lay institutions, for their reception and decent support. The males, whose inclinations might not dispose them to follow a religious avocation, the moment they attained the age of five-and-twenty, were ap pointed to the Quaranta. But, the claim to this provision for the Bernabotti, like that for the knights of Malta, depended on purity of blood. If that blood chanced to be contami nated by an unfortunate crossing of breed, the odds ran hard against their being entitled thereto. As their very subsistence, therefore, was made to depend on legitimacy, they rarely disgraced their birth by a plebeian marriage ; since, the provision was only bestowed on those, whose nativity and matrimonial unions were inscribed in the Golden Book, or register of nobility."], [103, "67 VENICE. There were, however, several liberal pro fessions, which intitled their followers to the rank of nobility. For instance : if the daughter of a professional man married a patrician, their offspring were inserted in the L'ibro d'Oro. If a patrician happened to unite himself to a ple beian, the females of that marriage, when wedded to a patrician, were allowed to take the rank of their husbands. The males were employed as secretaries, or as residents of the second order, at the different courts. This was the case with Alviso Quirini, brother to the well-known and beautiful Marina Benzoni ; their father having been a patrician, and their mother a butcher's daughter. I am not here speaking of the Alviso Quirini, who was the last ambas sador extraordinary to the French Directory ; he, as well as his lady, being both pure patri cians. This was the Alviso Quirini, who had the honour to be appointed, by the Austrian Govern ment at Venice, to attend on her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales, the late Queen of Eng land, during her residence in that city ; and whose wife presented all the Venetian ladies, whom her Royal Highness condescended either to see, or be seen by. The Government of Venice was in theory republican. Yet no citizen, however opulent, f2"], [104, "68 VENICE. could aspire to aristocratical prerogatives, unless he could prove, de facto, that neither himself nor his ancestors had been engaged in commer cial transactions for the space of two centuries. And, so jealous were they of their ancient pri vileges, that they only issued letters patent for aggregating the nobility of the Terra Firma to their own aristocracy in times of necessity, and when they had occasion to raise large sums of money, for carrying on their wars against the Turks, and other barbarous nations. If the Republics of Venice and of Malta still existed, Christianity would not now have to mourn over the thousands of its followers, who have been cruelly massacred by those savage infidels ! The number of those who were aggregated* from the Terra Firma to the Venetian nobility was very limited. They were even ballotted for by the Senate. Many have been rejected, and have had their money returned to them. For the nobility of the Terra Firma were obliged to * Every family, or individual, so called up, was obliged, as a guarantee for the due maintenance of the new dignity, to lodge a hundred thousand ducats in the Bank of Venice. This sum was lost to the family of the Marchioness of Solari, seeing that there had been no fresh aggregation from the Terra Ferma between the time of the money being lodged and the downfall of the Republic."], [105, "69 VENICE. undergo the same formalities as those of Venice ; and, even when aggregated, it required a cen tury or two, entirely to eradicate the prejudices existing between them and the old nobility. For instance, they could not belong to the Savio Consiglio di Dieci, or Council of Ten ; they could not be of the Inquisitori di Stata ; nor Doge ; nor ambassadors extraordinary ; nor Podesta of Venice, &c. Under the old Venetian Republic, the tribu nals were composed of one hundred and twenty members, called the Quarantia ; out of whom, forty were chosen by ballot, to preside, both as judges and jurors, in all civil matters. They were divided as follows: 1. La Quarantia civil vecchia ; 2. La Quarantia civil nuova ; 3. La Quarantia della Terra Ferma. The members were called Quaranta, because they belonged to the Quarantia. Every patri cian was eligible to the situation, as soon as he had attained the age of five-and-twenty. They much resembled an English jury ; only they held the office for life. They must have been men who had been regularly educated for the bar. They were not under the necessity of coming to an unanimous verdict, as is the case in British courts of justice ; but decided by a majority of votes, entirely from the evidence"], [106, "70 VENICE. which had come out before them, while sitting in the character of judges. If, by chance, it came to be known, that any member of the Quarantia had given a legal opinion upon the case, previously to its coming before him in his judicial capacity, he was declared incapable of sitting upon that trial, and his place was filled by another. As the members of the Quarantia were gene rally either men of small fortunes, or belonging to the order called Bernabotti, they each re ceived an annual salary, out of the public purse, ofa hundred and twenty golden ducats, called in the Venetian dialect zecchini, to distinguish them from the ducato, of which there are two sorts ; one of silver, of the value of four French francs; the other a nominal money, like our pound sterling, called ducato di Banco, worth something less than three francs. The Venetian Republic, during its beneficent and truly paternal sway, bestowed a pension on all the children of the Bernabotti, from their cradle upwards. That which, in other countries, is too often considered a misfortune, was, to the above-mentioned class, a source of comfort and of emolument. They therefore cheerfully obeyed, as early as nature would permit, the sacred injunction \u2014 \" Increase and multiply !\""], [107, "71 VENICE. When Buonaparte flagitiously overturned the antient Venetian power, many of these unfortu nate Bernabotti were deprived of the means of procuring a subsistence ; and, if some of their own countrymen had not generously stepped forward to relieve their immediate wants, they must inevitably have perished ; for their new masters quitted them, without making any other provision for them than two livres a day. This scanty pittance has, however, been deemed too large by their present rulers ; for, all those who have praise-worthily endeavoured to add to this wretched allowance by their own industry, and to gain a trifle by engaging themselves as clerks in mercantile houses, have actually been deprived of it, by a decree of his gracious Imperial Majesty, declaring all persons incapable of enjoying the luxury of this enormous pension, provided they happen to have any other means of procuring a subsistence for themselves and families. As it is quite impossible to live on this pittance, many have actually chosen to trust to the chance of getting employment, and have preferred to renounce their claim altogether, rather than exclude themselves, by accepting it, from every prospect of bettering their deplorable condition."], [108, "72 CHAPTER VIII.

When I have reflected on the treatment which Venice has met with at the hands of her new master, I have often wondered within myself, what his conduct towards her would have been, if, instead of being a \" bright jewel,\" and a \" most valuable gem,\" that royal personage had happened to consider her mere French paste ! This bombastic language wrought like a charm on the ears of the two and-thirty pro-"], [109, "VENICE. 73 prietors of the General Post, who had been robbed of their property, and deprived of the exercise of their functions, by the Corsican freebooter. Accordingly, the Company of Vene tian Couriers, as they are called, went up in a body, and presented to his Imperial Majesty a memorial, praying for the restitution of their property ; and begging to be either replaced in the exercise of their dearly-purchased immunities, or to be paid the sum which, centuries before, the Republic had resolved on granting them, if it should ever come to the determination of making the post-office a public concern. To which memorial, the Emperor most feelingly replied, that \" it was but fair and just that the Company should be indemnified, since the Government were then reaping the benefit of the concern ; but, in consequence of the expen sive wars which Austria had, for so many years, been compelled to carry on, the public treasury was at that time too much exhausted, to admit of any additional burthens ; however, if the Venetian States were willing to submit to the levying of a tax for that purpose, the produce should be duly applied to the liquidation of their claim.\" This proposition was accordingly made to the States, and was most patriotically acquiesced in ;"], [110, "74 VENICE. but, when the Austrians were driven from those States by the French, they carried away with them the produce of the tax so levied, without paying the company a single ducat ; and the debt remains unliquidated to the present hour, although many of those unfortunate couriers have had their lands and household goods seized on for a two months' arrear of the taxes. All the facts of this aggravating case have now stood on the Austrian official records for more than five-and-twenty years : yet, neither prin cipal nor interest has to this day been paid to the distressed sufferers ! On the dissolution of the ancient Venetian Government, the magnificent palace of Andrea Cornaro became a receptacle for the effects of many of the nobles, who, on retiring from the capital, were not able to dispose of them. In this situation they remained, until the Austrian Government purchased the above-mentioned palace for public offices. Scarcely, however, had it been taken possession of, when, in conse quence of the introduction of a number of German stoves, the palace caught fire, and the property of the unfortunate nobles, which had been therein deposited for nearly fifteen years, was totally destroyed. Marshal Chatlaire, who was at that time the"], [111, "VENICE. 75 military commander at Venice, and who had lived a great deal with the Turks, though a Frenchman by birth, conducted himself, on this distressing occasion, in a manner worthy of an infidel. In this instance, at least, the old English proverb, \" Tell me your company, and I'll tell you what sort of a man you are,\" was com pletely verified ; for he comported himself more like a barbarian than a Christian. Instead of calling out the firemen of the Arsenale \u2014 an active class of men, usually employed on such occasions \u2014 he directed five hundred of his horde of Croats to enter the palace ; who either savagely destroyed, or carried off with them, whatever the flames \u2014 more merciful than them selves \u2014 had spared. They demolished immense pier glasses of great value ; carrying off the fragments to their barracks, and making them serve in the place of razors to shave themselves with. They also took away numerous articles of expensive furniture belonging to the noble owner of the palace, and to others. This truly distressing circumstance is gene rally supposed to have been occasioned by the maliciously over-heating of the stoves, which the Austrians introduce wherever they go, to the total destruction of some of the finest paint ings and buildings in Venice ; since they are"], [112, "76 VENICE. not at all calculated either for the edifices or the climate of Italy. The effect produced by this fire on the minds of the people was so unfavourable to the Aus trians, that it was thought advisable to dispatch to Vienna a detailed account of the misfortune which had befallen this new public office. His Imperial Majesty, ever tremblingly alive to the welfare of his liege subjects, graciously directed a decree to be issued and sent round to the magistrates of Venice, enjoining them to procure estimates, drawn up on stamped paper, of the amount of the loss sustained by every indi vidual, and to transmit them forthwith to the Government at Vienna. This step quieted the unfortunate sufferers for a time. However, after a lapse of nearly a twelvemonth, they received from the Camera Aulica, the very consolatory answer \u2014 that \" no individual had a right to deposit property in any of the public offices ;\" though the Austrian Government, when it sent that answer, was well aware, that the property destroyed had been lodged in the palace fifteen years before it was purchased for a public office ! Hope, delusive meteor! what myriads hast thou misled and bewildered, by thy smiles and fascinating prospects ! What loads of treasure"], [113, "VENICE. 77 hast thou juggled out of the pockets of the rightful owners, and transferred to the bottom less coffers of the Austrian Exchequer ! leaving the cajoled expectants to exclaim with Has tings \u2014 O momentary grace of mortal men, Which we more hunt for than the grace of God ! Who builds his hope in air of your fair looks, Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast ; Ready, with every nod, to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep.\" Numerous are the decrees, of the above gra cious description, which have been issued by the Austrian Government, to quiet the unwary Venetians, by the expectation of redress for their grievances, and indemnification for their losses. This trick is resorted to, from motives of the most far-fetched guile, in order to extract the last ducat from the pockets of these miserable victims to every species of human disaster. For, be it known to my readers, that, once a week, his \"paternal\" and Imperial Majesty receives at Vienna the humblest ofhis German subjects. They must, however, as a preparatory and indis pensable step, be all of them furnished with a memorial, drawn up on stamped paper ; for, without a memorial so drawn up, not a Jack of them can be admitted into the royal presence !"], [114, "78 VENICE. But, alas for the poor Venetians, whose terri tory his Imperial Majesty designates as the \" brightest jewel \" and the \" most valuable gem\" of his crown, they are not permitted to feast their longing eyes on the august counte nance, unless when the Emperor graciously con descends to pay a visit to the city of desolation ! Being generally interdicted from journeying to Vienna, they have no other mode of making known their grievances, but through the me dium of stamped-paper memorials. No fewer than twelve thousand of these memorials, on subjects deeply affecting their well-being, have been returned to them, accompanied with a direct negative to their pressing solici tations. Nay, to such a pitch is this system carried, that it is now become quite a common thing at Venice, when it is rumoured that any one, not in the secret, is about to send off a petition to Vienna, appealing against some act of injustice, to exclaim \u2014 \" If you happen to have any money which you are desirous of flinging away, risk it in the lottery ; for there, at least, you have one chance out of a thousand in your favour : but, if you send a memorial to Vienna, no benefit can possibly arise out of it\u2014 except to the Austrian treasury /\""], [115, "79 VENICE. And, that this covert sort of impost is a highly lucrative one, there can, I believe, be very little doubt ; since his Imperial Majesty, once or twice in the space of every month, gives an audience, which lasts for six or eight hours, to persons of all ranks and descriptions, for the sole purpose of receiving these memorials. And, as they are generally returned, by the post, to the different petitioners, a fresh source of revenue presents itself to Austrian cupidity ! But, why should I complain of all this ? Are not the Venetians Italians? And, if the Germans ge nerously condescend to leave them their eyes to weep with, would it not be ingratitude, \" more hideous than the sea-monster,\" to complain ? Under the Venetian Government, and even under the yoke of Buonaparte, all persons known to be in slender circumstances were exempted, when they happened to have occasion to go to law, from the payment of certain stamp and register duties ; and not unfrequently from the expence of counsel, and the charges for briefs and affidavits. The simplicity, too, of the- law proceedings formerly, in comparison with those at present adopted, was, in the pro portion of one to a hundred, more beneficial, both to plaintiff and defendant, than the com plicated and confused forms introduced by the"], [116, "80 VENICE. Austrians. If properly followed up, a lawsuit, in the space of six weeks, might be carried through all its stages, up to its termination. The Venetian laws were also distinguished for their clearness and simplicity. Neither has the eloquence of their public pleaders been exceeded by the orators of any other country whatever. Indeed, for the space of centuries, the excellence of the laws of Venice, and the fairness with which those laws were adminis tered, occasioned the tribunals of that city to be held in such esteem throughout Italy, that per sons from all parts were accustomed to send their differences to be decided by the Courts of Venice, in preference to those existing in any other parts of the kingdom. But, all these great and glorious deeds of the olden time have vanished \u2014 never more to return ! At Venice, the poor have now no protector to look up to, save Heaven ! Under the iron gripe of Austria, the rising genius of her citizens is nipped in the bud. Men of talents are forbidden to exercise those talents, in the church, or at the bar; \u2014 at least, within -the Venetian territories. This barbarous policy operates most destruc tively ; for it not only checks the progress of the arts and sciences, but arrests the march of"], [117, "81 VENICE. civilization. It also strikes at the very root and life-spring of\" la beila litteratura Italiana.\" The Venetians, therefore, as they value their own comfort, should imitate the conduct of the ancient Greeks ; who, after the tyrant Sylla had overturned the tribunals at Athens, instituted aca demies, where the people were taught the art of forgetting what they had once acquired. Even the works of the great Metastasio \u2014 who wrote the chief part ofhis operas at Vienna, at the express command of her Imperial Majesty the Empress Maria Theresa, for the entertainment and instruction of her daughters, the Arch duchesses, and which works the murdered Marie- Antoinette was so passionately fond of, that she had committed their principal beauties to memory \u2014 even these works, I say, are now amongst the list of libri prohibiti, in the Aus trian dominions !

After the best consideration I have been able to give to the treatment which the people of Italy generally, and the Venetians in par ticular, have experienced at the hands of their task-masters, I cannot help saying, and I do not use the expression irreverently, that the latter, during a space of nearly two thousand years, are the only people who have followed the example of the Saviour of the world \u2014 who, when he received the sacrilegious slap, instead of resenting the foul insult, turned the other cheek to receive a repetition ofthe outrage. To nothing else can I compare the humiliating condition to which the noblest portion of God's creatures are now reduced ! We are told, that men are"], [119, "83 VENICE. never taught wisdom so effectually as in the school of adversity. I believe the maxim to be a just one. It should however be borne in mind by their rulers, that the Venetians are men ; and that, though they may hitherto have pa tiently submitted to the yoke of the oppressor, it does not necessarily follow, that they will for ever consent to remain in their present prostrate condition. Every individual possessing a grain of proper feeling, is naturally actuated by the laudable desire of being useful to his country ; and he expects to receive from his sovereign the re ward of his exertions, instead of seeing that re ward bestowed on a foreigner ; more especially when that individual feels, that he is not only in every respect the equal of the intruder, but greatly his superior, both in ability and in local information. No Venetian, however, is permitted to serve under the Austrian government, but as un'Alun 7io, and without pay. The Germans, never theless, are employed in all the departments of the state, both at Venice and in the Terra Firma, and receive regular salaries ; although many of them, from their entire ignorance of the Italian language, are incapable of perform ing their duty towards either their sovereign or the public. c 2"], [120, "84 VENICE. And, has a government thus unmindful ofthe sacred obligations which it owes to all its sub jects, any right to expect from those subjects love and attachment in return ? The Venetians, at present, are very little better than mere slaves attached to t,the soil. No one is allowed to be absent from his watery element on a visit to the Terra Firma, without first presenting himself before the police, and there making a full confession of \" parentage and education, life, character and behaviour,\" prior to his ob taining a passport. Let the business be ever so urgent, and the journey be merely to Fusina or Mestre \u2014 the former town being three, and the latter five miles from the capital \u2014 a delay of some days intervenes before the trifling request is complied with ; and even then it is only granted upon the responsibility of two respect able housekeepers, for the good conduct and safe return of the applicant. Should the individual soliciting the passport happen to be a person of rank, the request must, in that case, be made to the Secretary of State at Vienna, whose more pressing engagements will probably prevent his sending an answer for five or six months ; and, even then, it is not unfrequently in the negative. If in the affir mative, a deposit must be made, at the rate of a"], [121, "VENICE. 85 zecchino per month, for the time of being absent, and a couple of ducats must in addition be paid for the passport. It has been given out in this country, that his Imperial Majesty, from his \" paternal \" anxiety for the preservation of the magnificent monuments of art with which the city of Venice abounds, has interdicted the further demolition of those beautiful palaces, which can only be compared to a forest of rich marble, rising out of the briny ocean, by some such supernatural operation, as that which is narrated to have divided Sicily from Calabria, or formed the Pharos at Messina. It is scarcely possible for a traveller to give a faithful description of a city, which differs from every known city, not only in Europe, but in the other quarters of the globe. The sight of the immense blocks of beautiful marble, which present themselves between the foundation piles, and the palaces reared upon them, has such an astounding effect upon the beholder, as almost to leave him in doubt whether marble, as well as the piscatory tribe, be not the native production of the watery element : for it appears impossible, that the vessels used in na vigation at that remote period, should have been of sufficient dimensions to have conveyed those"], [122, "86 VENICE. massy blocks, from Greece to their present station ; or that, when they had reached Venice, they could have been landed uninjured out of those vessels, but by the aid of the most skilful and most perfect machinery. The sums ex pended upon the hidden foundations of these noble palaces, are calculated to have greatly exceeded the cost of the visible parts of these splendid edifices. His Imperial Majesty is a native of classical Florence, and may therefore naturally be presumed to be a patron of the fine arts. In consequence of the present system of govern ment at Venice, many of the most distinguished patrician families having, from cruel necessity, been obliged to pull down a portion of these monuments of their former grandeur, to pro cure to themselves the means of a miserable subsistence in the country, which of course destroyed the uniformity of the city ; to prevent a repetition of the practice, a decree was issued from Vienna, forbidding the proprietors to deface or mulitate any of the palaces. But, in the teeth of its own decree, this most consistent as well as most \" paternal \" government, has not hesitated\u2014 oh, dire digrace ! oh, unheard of sacrilege ! \u2014 to confiscate them for arrears of taxes, and to dispose of them to Jews, who"], [123, "87 VENICE. convert the classical remains into storehouses, after taking down the ornaments and selling the materials. So that the barbarous custom which the decree was intended to prevent, sdli con tinues unabated ; for no one, now-a-days, would think of purchasing a Venetian palace, upon any other than the above Israelitish principle, \u2014 a practice this, which adds daily to the misery of this already too-much oppressed and worn-down people : for, under the hammer of the govern ment auctioneer, a splendid palace is often knocked down for a mere song. That many of the noble patrician families are reduced to the last stage of misery, is but too notorious. In proof of the distressing fact, I will only adduce the sudden death of poor Zorzi, the patrician, and husband of Marcellina Gondollmer, who was found dead near the Piazza di San Marco, from actual want of food and raiment ! The above-mentioned lady ac- companied Mr. Rose, in his travels through Italy, and came with him to this country. She has since returned, with her son, to her native land, where she is living comfortably upon a pension, which has been liberally settled upon her by our enlightened countryman. The public taxes at Venice, as I have already observed, are collected, under the present au-"], [124, "88 VENICE. thorities, every two months : for thc payment of which, a printed government receipt is given. Should, however, the tax-gatherer abscond, which is no uncommon case, the individual, notwithstanding his receipt, is compelled to pay them over again. Commerce, navigation, agriculture, as well as all the useful arts and sciences, are now mere non-entities at Venice. The exorbitant excise and customs duties, together with other vexa tions, have deterred all merchant vessels from trading to that port, since it has been under the \" paternal \" government of Austria. I must, however, except a few boats bringing salt-fish, red herrings, and dried sprats. If therefore, the poor forlorn Venetians stand in need of a barrel of coffee, or a hogshead of sugar, they must patiently wait, until they can procure it from Trieste, at second or third hand. Though it is not uncommon for a vessel to reach Venice from the last-mentioned port, in the short space of eight hours ; yet, from the numerous obstacles thrown in the way by the custom-house officers, it is at least as many days before it can be unloaded. The com mercial regulations adopted by Austria have occasioned a decrease in the import and export"], [125, "89 VENICE. trade of Venice, to the extent of thirty thousand florins per month. The commercial buildings and warehouses are actually become mere watch-boxes, and barracks for the men, who were once busily employed as porters, to load and unload the merchandize ; but who are now chiefly occupied in guarding the bales for transit, or in prevent ing the hungry rats from gnawing the cordage and packing. Such is the present degraded condition of the spot which, until the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, was considered the first commercial city of the world ! So celebrated was once the Arsenal of Venice, that it was looked up to as a model for all the dock-yards and other naval establishments throughout Europe. Four-and-twenty ships of war were constantly kept in a state of readiness, either for the use of the republic, or the service of its allies. Thus were thousands upon thou sands of skilful and industrious artificers, of every description connected with the maritime department, kept in constant employ, within the small circle of three miles. Trees in their unhewn shape, rough from the forests, entered the arsenal, and sailed out of it vessels com pletely equipped for service, and wanting nothing"], [126, "90 VENICE. but their warlike stores, such as cannon, balls, and powder ; which were conveyed to them in small boats, to the mouth of the sea, called il Lido, at the distance of about three miles from Venice ; since no vessel drawing more than seven feet water can approach nearer to the city. Over the gateway of the arsenal still stands the winged lion of St. Mark, guarded on either side by colossal lions, taken from the Pir\u00e6us at Athens. Now, alas, this monument of Venetian skill, and industry, and enterprize, is little more than a receptacle for old lumber, and the choppings up of the logs and staves of decayed vessels for fuel ! To give my reader a correct notion of the amazing sapience of the Austrians in matters appertaining to commerce, I need only state, that on their first taking possession of this once flourishing port, the cockets which they calcu lated would serve them for six months were not more than sufficient for the demand often days \u2014 a circumstance which occasioned a total stagna tion of trade, until a further supply could be procured from that sanctum sanctorum the Aulic Chamber at Vienna ; as they are not suffered to be printed at Venice. For a Venetian to go to Vienna to demand redress for any injury he may have sustained,"], [127, "91 VENICE. would be almost as difficult as it would be for a man to land in any part of Europe, after a voyage to Turkey, without previously perform ing quarantine. These \" bright jewels,\" these \"valuable gems\" of Venetian subjects, as their \" paternal\" sovereign styles them, are preserved as carefully as diamonds in cotton. They are shut out from the capital of Austria ; and the local governors have especial orders not to grant them passports for that purpose. Like crown jewels, they are only to be seen on extraordinary occasions. But then, their native lustre, how ever they may have been pent up in darkness, is found to outvie whatever is placed in compe tition with them ; nor can even the iron hand of despotism tarnish their intrinsic brilliancy. In the ears of those who do not intend a remedy, the vibration of the complaints of the injured must ever be discordant and unwelcome. The more remote, therefore, the sufferers are from the authors of their grievances, the less will \" the worm of conscience begnaw their souls ;\" for, assuredly, the delicate nerves of ex alted personages ought not to be deprived of their accustomed tension, on account of the miseries of a few thousand poverty-struck and half-starved human beings ! The Venetians are not even permitted to"], [128, "92 VENICE. reprint the newspaper published at Vienna, until it has been carefully examined by the officers of the police ; who strike out whatever they may think fit, before they suffer it to be translated into the Italian language. Graziosi, the editor and proprietor of a journal, for not having con formed to this most degrading regulation, was arrested by the police, and threatened with fine, imprisonment, and the total suppression of his paper. In his defence he alleged, that \" he had done nothing more than give a verbatim transla tion of the contents of the German journal, written under the immediate inspection of M. Pilato, the political secretary of Prince Metter nich ; and that he could not imagine that mat ters of a treasonable nature would find their way into a pubhcation issuing from such a quarter.\" Notwithstanding which, he was severely repri manded, and told, that \" there was a wide differ ence between what ought to be allowed to the inhabitants of the capital of the empire, and what ought to be allowed to the natives of a conquered city of a petty province.\" The tame submission of the present race of Venetians, proves them to be subjects worthy of such a government. The same conduct is to this day rigorously observed. Not a newspaper do the police suffer to make its appearance, until they"], [129, "VENICE. 93 have cut out and garbled whatever they may be anxious to keep from the eyes of the enslaved population ! CHAPTER X. VENICE. Overthrow qf the Monastic Institutions at Venice Reduced Condition qf their former Inmates Low State qf the Ecclesiastical Establishments Religion qf the Venetians A Visit to the Greek Church And to the Armenian The Inquisition. Throughout the Venetian territories, as well as in every other part of Italy, the monks and nuns have fallen into the toils of the revolution. Not that I regret the overthrow of the monastic institutions ; though I cannot but deprecate the treatment which some of the noble as well as most worthy members of these and of other peaceable establishments have met with. These unfortunate beings, of both sexes, were exclusively natives of the Venetian territories. They were most exemplary in the performance of their moral and religious duties, and distin guished for their charity towards the poor of"], [130, "94 VENICE. their dependencies. If conduct so praiseworthy can weigh aught in their favour with the unpre judiced and the benevolent, I trust it will be my excuse for exposing to the world the harsh treatment which they have experienced under the rule of Austria. The greater part of them were the relatives of patrician families, who had been reduced to ruin by the overthrow of the Republic. They had been too delicately brought up to betake themselves to menial occupations ; and many of them were too old to be made serviceable. Consequently, when they were driven from their convents, if there had not been some small allowance for their daily support, they must, in this, the eighteenth century of Christian civilization, have inevitably perished from hunger. Oh! if our much-vaunted Philanthropic so cieties, and our Bible societies, and our Men dicity societies, and our societies for the Sup pression of Vice, and the Abolition of Sla very, had but condescended to bestow an atom of their benevolence on these devoted victims of revolutionary principles, surely it would have been as honourable, and to the full as pleasing in the sight of God, as it was to assail the House of Commons with clamours for the Abolition of the Black Slave Trade !"], [131, "VENICE. 95 In all governments there must exist a hierarch. Why, then, should the Lady Abbess, ox il padre Abate, not be suffered to exercise the same prerogative over the menial servant of a convent, which the field-marshal exercises over the private soldier, or the bishop over the curate, and which, in fact, is exercised in every country, and distinguishes the dependant from the su perior ? V At Venice, however, the Lady Abbess and the kitchen-maid, the house-porter and the head of the convent, had alike the same scanty pension of a couple of Venetian livres ; that is to say, about tenpence English money per day, allowed them to subsist upon ; as if these unfortunate, and worn down, and decrepid crea tures had no longer any claim on the common feelings of humanity ! And, even this miserable sum, out of which they are to find themselves in food, and in clothes, and in habitation, is not paid to them, until six months after it becomes due : by which delay, the government not only saves something in the way of interest, but speculates on the chance of some ofthe poor creatures dying in the interim. Nor are the tradespeople willing to give them the least credit ; well knowing that the govern ment, in case they should die within the six"], [132, "96 V E N 1 C E. months, would refuse to pay their debts, though those debts might have been contracted for the very necessaries of life. So that these miserable beings would literally be reduced to a state of starvation, were it not for the Benevolence of a few of their old dependents and some charitable shop-keepers, who formerly served their con vents, and who, from gratitude for past kind nesses, continue to supply them on trust for the articles they may stand in need of. In all catholic countries, when any extraordi nary national calamity befalls the people, the government generally give directions to the ecclesiastical authorities to order public prayers to be offered up to the Supreme Being, beseech ing him to avert the impending danger. These religious ceremonies are performed with all that pomp and decorum, which is customary in that religion, when invoking the Almighty. The churches are brilliantly lighted up ; and although, on these occasions, they are crowded to excess, there rarely happens the least dis order. Although their ecclesiastics, under the Vene tian Republic, possessed no absolute authority, as is the case in other states, yet they used to provide the means necessary on these solemn occasions; well knowing the liberal system of"], [133, "97 VENICE. the government, in all matters of public utility, and especially in matters appertaining to religion ; and that it never took advantage of those who confided in its generosity. But, at present, this class, like the former inhabitants of the convents, are so shabbily rewarded for their services, that they are no longer in a con dition to supply the church, even for its common necessaries, much less for extraordinary occa sions. The above ceremony usually commenced with the exhibition of the crucifix, surrounded by twenty-four wax torches. Under the plea of preserving good order, this ceremony, as well as the lighting up of the church, is not now suffered, without first sending to Vienna for permission. But, religious zeal can stomach no delay ; and, to prevent the consequences likely to ensue from disappointment, the clergy of the Basilica of San Marco, the first cathedral in Christendom, have actually been under the necessity of parading the streets, going from house to house, and begging the shopkeepers of the Merceria, and all piously disposed per- sons, to contribute towards the expense of calling upon the Supreme Being to assist them in their affliction ! But, what \" affliction,\" on this side the grave, can equal that of living VOL. I. H"], [134, "98 VENICE. under a government, which, though professing the same religion, nevertheless withholds from its subjects the means of appealing to their Creator, in the mode which that religion enjoins? For even this cannot be done, without the sanc tion of the Aulic Chamber at Vienna ! Of all human sufferings, none are probably so truly galling as those which rankle in the breast of a noble, intellectual being \u2014 an Italian, for instance, sincere, unsuspicious, complaisant, polite, and yielding \u2014 when he finds himself duped and betrayed by a brutal and ignorant clown, whose only talent consists in low roguery! How humiliating it must be for Venetians to lie at the pleasure {mercy, it were idle to say), and the policy of Germans, Englishmen can scarcely conceive. Thraldom, under the yoke of fo reigners \u2014 and such foreigners ! \u2014 is a condition unknown to Britons. Long may they continue to be thus ignorant ! And long may they know how to appreciate the unrivalled blessings which they enjoy, under their ancient and invaluable system of government ! With respect to the religion of the Venetians, there can be no doubt that the worship of the Deity exists, in its full sense, in a city abound ing in churches, rich in every description of sacred ornaments, parishes abundantly supplied"], [135, "99 VENICE. with clergy, and hospitals administering to the wants of, and serving as asylums for, suffering humanity. In conformity with the primitive spirit of their institution, the clergy are excluded from any interference in matters of government. TRe curates are elected by the people in their respective parishes. The several religious ceremonies at Venice are conducted with as much pomp and show as in any other part of Italy ; and with the utmost decency, order, and propriety. I have been informed, that at one of the ceremonies in lit. Mark's Church, whilst all the senators, the Venetian nobility of both sexes, and an immense congre gation, were on their knees at their devotions, an Englishman was observed standing : seeing this, one of the senators went up to him, and with great politeness informed him, it was ne cessary that he should comply with the usual custom. To which the Englishman answered, \" that he did not believe in transubstantiation.\" \" Nor I,\" replied the senator ; \" but, go down on your knees instantly, or walk out of the church.\" All religions are tolerated at Venice. The inhabitants used to bury their dead under their churches, there being no other cemetery ; but, since the revolution, it has been found necessary, h2"], [136, "100 VENICE. the better to avoid many inconveniencies, to inter the deceased in the different islands. The Jews, however, were always obliged to bury their relatives at Lido, three miles from the city. The Greeks at Venice have an archbishop, who exercises all the episcopal functions of their religion. He has also a seminary for young men coming from Greece, or from the islands. The day on which I went to their mass the archbishop himself officiated. I happened acci dentally to be seated near one of these youths, who informed me, that he was a native of the confines of Epirus in Thessaly, and lived in the district ofthe former residence ofthe Oracle of Dodona. The Greek mass and ceremony differ much from the Latin. Every one, on entering the church, gives a slight inclination of the body, his face being towards the door of the sanctuary of the altar ; which is the only one in the temple. eir entranceand arrival at the altar the audience make an immense number of signs of the cross, with the thumb against the fore head, then right and left, from one extremity to the other, retiring reverentially with a bend of the knee ; advancing afterwards to the altar, and bowing, one after the other, with signs of the most fervent devotion."], [137, "101 VENICE. The paintings which are hung on the walls conceal from the people and the choristers what is passing within the sanctuary. When it is lowered like a curtain, every one retires respect fully, and seats himself. The archbishop, on entering, attended by his seminary, goes through the same ceremony, before he puts on his epis copal robes to say mass ; which is performed by the individuals of his suite. During the cere mony of mass, the sanctuary is closed, and is only opened at times for the orations to the people, whose voices accompany the benedic tion ; and for the reception of the space that is consecrated for the choristers, and which is held in great respect. The rest of the ceremony consists of singing and prayer. The person who officiates is enclosed in the sanctuary. The prayer composed for St. John Chrysostom, the celebrated patriarch of Constantinople, is re sponded to by the people, with a fervour corres ponding to the object ; while the choristers chaunt, and the singing boys unite their voices with all their strength. The shutting up of the sanctuary, during the performance ofthe liturgy, surprised me the more, as I had been given to understand that the contrary was the practice in the primitive ages of the Greek church."], [138, "102 VENICE. In the Armenian church there are two altars ; the one shut up like that of the Greeks ; the other placed in the middle of the church, for the private masses. At one of these I assisted one Sunday : it lasted seven hours, beginning early in the morning, and ending at mid-day. The ceremony, in which the people were allowed to take a part, consisted in a young lad putting on and taking off surpluses, and other eccle siastical insignia, of different colours and shapes, at least twenty times ; in lighting a wax torch, and anon extinguishing it ; in pacing ra pidly up and down the church, and then resting himself to take breath ; and in placing his thumb or handkerchief on his nether lip. During this, the chaunting of the bishop was heard from the sanctuary ; which was now and then opened, and again shut. The bishop was a very short man, with a most agreeable and intelligent countenance. His pontifical robes were magni ficent: instead ofa mitre, he wore a Swiss col lege black cap. In the middle of the mass which was going on in the sanctuary, one of the attendants commenced mass at the second altar, in rather a low tone of voice. There was, in his demeanour and different attitudes, while officiating at the altar, that unaffected ele-"], [139, "VENICE. 103 gance of deportment, which painters denominate \" the grand style.\" As he wore a long, thick, white beard, the appearance of this very extra ordinary personage somewhat withdrew my attention from the old gossips by whom I was surrounded, and whose conversation entirely turned on the disputes and tittle-tattle of their respective families and friends. When the whole was over, I exclaimed from the bottom of my heart, Te Deum laudamus I I have heard it said, that the Greeks and Armenians were under certain restrictions, with regard to the exercise of their religious worship. I know not what may have been the case else where, but certainly there were none such at Venice, under the Republic ; as they were only enjoined silence upon those articles which sepa rated them from the Roman church. On the contrary, the Venetians were constantly restrain ing the Catholic clergy from practising sundry impositions. The Inquisition was one of the greatest securi ties against the abuses ofthe clergy, more than of any other class of subjects. The people were often indebted for their lives and liberties to that much-talked-of and much abused tribunal ; which never exercised its functions, but in the same way as the English House of Peers interposes its"], [140, "104 V-\u00a3 N 1 C K. power, between the crown and the people. It was a balance, which prevented the Venetian nobility from usurping undue authority, and kept the people in subjection to the laws ofthe state. With regard to liberty of speech, no people on earth enjoyed a larger portion of it than the Venetians. Every coffee-house was a public place of debate. Even St. Mark's Square was often the resort, where the utterance given to political opinions would make the Procuratia resound with the arguments in favour of this state, and against the other state, during the wars that took place, and especially on the breaking out of the fatal French revolution. I am not a Venetian ; but a twenty years' intercourse with all ranks and classes of that interesting and much injured people, thus au thorizes me to detail facts which have come within my own knowledge, and to assert boldly the honest truth, to the best of my recollection and ability."], [141, "105 CHAPTER XI. VENICE. Re/lections on the Conduct pursued by Buonaparte towards the Italian States And on the Imitation qf that Conduct by those who have succeeded him in the Usurpation qf the Country. I shall now offer a few observations and reflections on the conduct which has been pur sued towards the Italian States, not only by Buonaparte, but by those who have succeeded him in the conquest and government of that ill-fated portion of Europe. Attached as I passionately am to a country, so celebrated for its natural beauties and its clime, and so distinguished for centuries as the seat of arts and the sciences ; and having, for a space of more than twenty mortal years, witnessed her misfortunes, and been, from a matrimonial alliance, a sharer therein, I cannot help entertaining the pleasing hope, that the day will arrive, when Italy, fair Italy, shall be liberated from her present enthralled condition. Possessing a thorough acquaintance with the"], [142, "106 VENICE. language of the country, and having lived on terms of the closest intimacy with many indi viduals who were both civilly and politically employed in its government, I have drawn my facts from authentic sources, and particularly that portion of them which relates to the con duct of Buonaparte towards the people of Italy. I arrived in that beautiful kingdom at a period of life when the faculties of the mind were expanding themselves with the milk and honey of blooming youth \u2014 untainted by false impres sions, unfettered by rank prejudices. The best days of my existence were passed under that happy sky. There were my limited talents cul tivated; there were they flattered and admired; and the hospitality I so generously met with at the hands ofthe natives \u2014 by whom I was looked upon as their countrywoman \u2014 induced me to adopt the once happy soil as my second patria. Circumstances connected with the troubles of the times afterwards compelled me to withdraw myself from the continent, and return to my native land. Experience has taught me, neither to court the smiles ofthe great, nor to fear their unmerited frowns. It has been my endeavour, throughout the following observations and re flections, to steer as clear from party prejucices, as it is possible for one to do, whose heart is"], [143, "VENICE. 107 still bleeding from the effects of the envenomed shafts which family misfortunes have there im planted. I have ever loved my country, and revered the principles of her inimitable system of government ; which, like her own sturdy oak, after enduring for centuries the \" peltings of the pitiless storm,\" has grown up to maturity. I have ever mistrusted the mania of modern philosophers for violent changes, and their idle notions of human perfectibility ; well con vinced, that the tendency of their cold and selfish principles was to deluge Europe with blood, and to undermine the palladium of re ligion ; \u2014 a general toleration of which is, in my mind, the first principle that unites civilized society, and the brightest ornament of the English Constitution. From the influence of his revolutionary sys tem upon all classes of mankind, Buonaparte has inflicted on Europe the deadly curse of an unsettled generation. In consequence of that fatal influence, I was necessitated to spend severa] years of my life away from my family, in different countries ; where the sight of the misery to which the people were reduced, by that pernicious system, afforded me ample means of examining into those old grievances, which they had been induced to exchange for new"], [144, "108 VENICE. and uncertain advantages ; \u2014 advantages never to be realized, and not for a moment to be put in competition with the blessings they had lost ; namely, moral principle, integrity, tranquillity, confidence between man and man ! Such were the effects of Buonaparte's systeme egoiste ! Let me intreat some of the upper classes in this country steadily to bear in mind, that the French Revolution set out with a reform levelled at the property of individuals, and not against the above principles. Let them recollect that, in order to get possession of that property, hatred, malice, and every degree of wickedness, were lurking under the foul disguise, until the nefarious object had been accomplished. Who were the victims of private assassinations ? who were massacred in the prisons ? who were daily butchered at the public scaffolds ? \u2014 the mis guided nobility, persons of rank and fortune, rich and peaceable merchants, fathers of fami lies, honest and quiet housekeepers ! The executions against the rebel mob only took place when Buonaparte had no further occasion for their services ; and then, when they became clamorous for the blood-money, the promised reward of their services, they were put to death, from a fear that they might discover their employers. These are facts which"], [145, "109 VENICE. cannot be disputed, as they notoriously occurred wherever Buonaparte made his appearance with his army of regenerators ; and such conduct on his part was the more unpardonable, as some of the best writers of France had been employed by the Corsican in composing, and in circulating all over Italy, works containing the soundest principles, and enforcing the strictest order and discipline. \" Les Italiens,\" says Madame de Stael, whom I had the honour to be intimately acquainted with, in the years 1791 and 1792, as well as with Monsieur and Madame Neckar ; \" les Italiens sont plus remarquables par ce qu'ils ont \u25a0ete, et par ce qu'ilspourront etre, que par ce qu'ils sont maintenant.\" The sentimentis a correct one ; but, Madame de Stael saw the Italians at a time when it was almost impossible to give a decided opinion respecting them ; and, though I entertain the greatest respect for the talents ofthat extraor dinary woman, as well as for her private virtues, \u25a0I cannot help differing with her, as to the general character of that people, and of thinking them still capable of shewing themselves worthy descendants of the conquerors of the world. Strike off the head of a man, and the body becomes a useless trunk. The head of the Italians, considered as a nation, has long since"], [146, "110 VENICE. been struck off by their foreign oppressors, who have most unwisely and impolitically kept them divided ; and which state of division has ever had, and must continue to have, a decided influ ence on the moral energies of a great people. If it be absolutely necessary to divide a nation, in consequence of that nation having be come the mistress of the world, why was France, after the dethronement of Napoleon, left in static quo ? The present race of Italians exhibit the dis tressing spectacle of a body of nineteen millions of men, wanting the energies of a head. Who have been their sovereigns ? And, what have those sovereigns done for them, during the space of seven centuries ? They have been schooling them in the lessons of the ancient Greek masters, who, after the execrable Sylla had destroyed Greece, taught the people to forget their past condition, instead of improving their morals, and enlarging their virtues. Buonaparte divided the Italians still more than their preceding yoke-masters had done. Take a lion, or any other savage animal, draw his teeth, pare the nails of his paws, and the creature becomes tame as a lady's lap-dog. So it is at present with the Italians. Misery, and division upon division, have annihilated their"], [147, "VENICE. 111 former Jierte of character ; and I am sorry to add, that the conduct observed towards them by the successor of the exile of St. He lena, is little calculated to better their con dition ! Spell-bound by the rapid ascension of that ambitious rocket, hurled from the revolutionary mortar, the several cabinets of Europe, not excepting that of St. James, appear to have imagined, that an imitation, on their part, ofthe conduct of that Scourge of the Universe must inevitably be attended with success ; provided they took care to avoid those fatal errors which occasioned his overthrow. I allude to such extra vagant projects as the invasion of Spain and of Russia ; and more especially the latter, at such an advanced period of the year. What a puerile imbecility do notions like these betray ! As if an Omnipotent Maker of the Universe had but one mode of inflicting punishment on man ! As if tyranny, and fraud, and corruption, did not carry in their train the very elements of retributive j ustice ! Another striking proof, if any were wanted, of the general fatuity, is to be discovered in the rage for imitating Napoleon. For scarcely is there a private individual of any weight in society, who does not endeavour to inspire"], [148, "112 VENICE. those around him with a sort of respect, by casting over his own actions that sort of doubt and perplexity, which the French Emperor uniformly practised, allowing no one to guess what the resolves of the mighty man were to be! How silly, and at the same time how knavish this kind of conduct often is ! In deeds, perpe tuating his evil spirit ; in words, decrying and execrating his foul actions ! With one hand, begriming and pulling down the heraldic in signia of his rule \u2014 with the other, dispersing and sending about his image in every direc tion : the coin in circulation throughout France and Italy still bearing his image and super scription : one day tearing to pieces and vilifying that, which, on the next, they uphold and extol to the very skies ; reminding one of the eternal toil to which poets have condemned the wicked after death, for the crimes they were guilty of while living \u2014 \" et Danai genus Iifame, damnatusque longi Sisyphus \u00c6olides laboris.\""], [149, "( us ) CHAPTER XII.

The Subject continued. \u2014 Buonaparte considered as a General The Napoleon Military System described His Mode qf treating the Soldiers Strict Discipline of his Armies Some qf the leading Causes qf his Overthrow pointed out Origin qf Revolutions in a State. Now that Napoleon is gone the way of all flesh, it is the fashion to eulogize and puff him off as a great man ; and, if the attempted pal liation were not intended as an apology for the adoption of his despotic measures, I should not be unwilling, to a certain extent, to join in the encomium. As a general, in the hour of battle, he shewed himself a god of war \u2014 a very Mars. Possessing a consummate knowledge of the military science, he was, for quickness of intellect and prompti tude of execution, altogether without a parallel. But, the thing which stamped him a general of the first rate was his always commencing the battle, and striking the first blow. For whije he thereby infused the confidence of hope into VOL. I. I"], [150, "114 VENICE. his own troops, he generated the chill of despair into those of his adversary. He would not be dictated to by any mortal breathing. Accus tomed, by superior skill, to baffle the plans of his adversary, he ever took the lead, and preserved it to the last ; thereby striking terror and dismay into the bosoms of the stoutest. The carrying on of a defensive warfare he left for those feeble souls, who were either paralyzed through fear, cramped and fettered by respon sibility, or ignorant of human nature. And, did not Napoleon act wisely in so doing? Admitting the contending bodies to be of equal strength, is it not a fact, that the assailant is ever the most formidable ? Let us suppose the field of battle to be a billiard table : does not the propelled ball drive on the other ball ? In fact, so far from the resisting object having the advantage, it is not certain that it will ever have an opportunity of striking a single blow. The tactics of Hannibal were invariably those of assault. The wary Fabius has been lauded for his prudence, in standing upon the defensive ; when, in fact, he had no other alternative, in the miserable, derelict extremities of Rome, whose numerous legions had been successively de stroyed by the daring Carthaginian. The far famed retreats of Moreau, and of other great"], [151, "115 VENICE. generals, not forgetting that of the Ten Thou sand Greeks, are feats of war which we take no delight in extolling. When speaking of discord and its furies \u2014 of the crush of battle and the shock of arms\u2014 it is the Macedonian, it is the Roman, it is the French Emperor, whose dread achievements elicit our wonder and admiration. It is the progress of the conqueror that we applaud. Suppose a couple of gladiators en gaged \u2014 the first lunge may disable the opponent for ever. In short, even in the brute creation, strength discovers itself in the same way ; the more feeble of the two very rarely commencing the onset. In a period of peace, indeed, the case is different. Then, the ministers of a country ought to be passive. To conquer the more surely, they ought to wait patiently ; success being ever the object in view. Though by no means convinced of their originality, I am, furthermore, willing to allow that some of Napoleon's projects were vast in the extreme, and that they were arranged with a profound knowledge of universal society. Egyptians and Italians, Jews and Gentiles, he alike took a part in their concerns. Germans and Spaniards, Turks and Russians, were chess men, which he managed and moved to and fro i 2"], [152, "116 VENICE. like another Philidor, rendering them subsidiary to his renown, and tributary to his army ; which was composed of a portion of each. France he overawed by strangers, and all other nations by foreign bayonets. Lest effeminacy should creep in amongst them, his soldiers were never suffered to remain long in one place, but were marched to fresh quarters every three or four months : thus, flinging \" resty sloth\" to the dogs ; and, by keeping up their natural buoyancy and activity of spirits, preparing them for that strict discipline so essentially necessary in the hour of battle. Such men, in fact, were the veterans who perished in the snows of Russia. So accus tomed were they implicitly to execute the orders of their General, that none of the troops be longing to the other sovereigns of Europe had been able to cope with them. Neither ought England to repine at this ; since, in the plenitude of Napoleon's power, she achieved every thing that circumstances would admit of. Truly did that man exclaim, that to himself only was he indebted for his overthrow. Aye, and for all the disasters of the Russian expedition ! Had he panted less for an individuality of authority : had he, both as a monarch and a captain, sought for exclusive supremacy with an ardour a little"], [153, "117 VENICE. more tempered : had he been willing to share but a small portion of his laurels with his com panions in arms \u2014 Massena, Augereau, and the other mighty champions of democracy and of the French Republic, who had sprung up simul taneously with himself: had not the fumes of personal ambition, the venom of adulation, and the blandishments of vice, warped his talents and intoxicated his understanding : had not all these things taken place, a forest of heroes would, in defiance of the hyperborean blast, have grown up around his throne, and enabled him to laugh to scorn the combined efforts of his enemies. Buonaparte was more dreaded by the gene rality of mankind than he was esteemed. This was abundantly shewn in the critical moment of his authority. Had he practised less cunning and low shuffle, he would have shewn himself a better politician. \" Aye, to be sure,\" have exclaimed some, \" the unfortunate always com mit errors !\" Although the sentiment is sarcas tically thrown out, it is nevertheless a just one. And, of all the crowned heads, Buonaparte was assuredly the most culpable : since, the man who had not been brought up from his youth in the trammels of royalty ; who had had far better opportunities than the offspring of Kings, of i 3"], [154, "118 VENICE. studying human nature, and of thereby avoiding its prejudices, ought, above all things, not to have forfeited the regard of the people, by the resumption of those most tyrannical and op pressive ordinances, to overturn which the French Revolution had exploded. Reckless of the consequences, he studied too, in imitation of the other powers, to bring about a plethora in the body politic, by increasing, beyond all due proportion, the uppermost ranks of society. Now, whenever the vital sap ceases to flow in the minor and inferior vessels, a para lysis, or some other fatal crisis, necessarily ensues. When the subordinate parts become lifeless and parched up, the whole fabric soon totters before the blast, and the first hurricane levels it in the dust. When we shall see a wise limitation organized against every inordinate amplification of property, then, and not till then, shall I consider, that an advancement really and truly beneficial has been effected in the science of legislation ; convinced, as I am, that the enormous disparity which exists between the property and possessions of mankind, is the great origin and well-spring of moral evil. Not that I would, on any account, recommend a sudden revulsion. I would merely propose an amelioration, founded upon the immutable"], [155, "VENICE. 119 dictates of nature. As for the convulsions and revolutions of society, who that has endeavoured to search after truth, in the depth of her re cesses, does not know, that the very schemes which are planned for the prevention of those convulsions, invariably concoct and bring them to maturity ? For, whenever a pressure becomes too excessive to be endured, the consequences, as we well know from fatal experience, are inevitable. I do not say, as so many others have done, that \" the people rebel.\" On the contrary, I assert, that there is no such thing as the spontaneous setting in motion of a mass so besotted as, time out of mind, \" the people\" have proved them- selves to be. Those books of history, which tell us to the contrary, are the effusions of ig- norance or of falsehood. Of cour se I am speaking of decided and downright revolutions ; and which revolutions have invariably had their origin from some other quarter than that of the yawning and ignorant canaglia. An extreme cupidity at the fountain head of the Govern- ment \u2014 a sucking eagerness at the mouth, to the exhaustion of the other parts of the body \u2014 rapine on the part of pro-consuls at their dis tant seats of government, who, in the space of a few years, return to the mother-country, i 4"], [156, "120 VENICE. not merely with their shattered fortunes re paired, but abounding in wealth \u2014 these, these are the things which bring ruin to an empire ! Remote provinces have ever been the scenes of pillage and of malversation \u2014 even in the times of ancient Rome. First came Asia. She was subdued by the force of arms. Her luxuries, together with her wealth, found their way into Italy. Circum stances again changed ; and, after the accu mulated treasures had, in the lapse of a few centuries, disappeared, the taste for Asiatic aro matics, drapery, and what not, rather increased than declined. So that subsequently, and after the chains of vassalage had been broken in Asia, its inhabitants continued to hold Rome tributary ; and more than retrieved \u2014 more than avenged \u2014 their former misfortunes. \u2014 \" Nunc patimur long\u0153 pads mala : s\u0153vior armis \" Luxuria incubuit, victumque ulciscitur orbem.\" \" Now, all the evils of long peace are ours ; \" Luxury, more terrible than hostile powers, \" Her baleful influence wide around has hurl'd, \" And well aveng'd the subjugated world.\" * * GifFord's Juvenal."], [157, "121 CHAPTER XIII. VENICE. The Subject continued The Napoleon Military System qf Government further inquired into Its Effects on the Customs and Habits qf the French People Napoleons deceitful and crafty Policy exposed His Surrender to the British And Death at St. Helena. But, to bring my theory down to more modern times, and more recent vicissitudes. Turning the cabinet into the camp, we find Napoleon studying political economy more like a General than a Sovereign. Trade he des pised ; commerce he crushed : while, on the other hand, he exacted enormous contributions for the support of his armies. If poverty be contemptible, he took the sure and certain way of rendering all those who were concerned in traffic, objects of thorough derision. And so far was his hatred towards England satiated ; for he had certainly the satisfaction of seeing his followers regarding \" la nation boutiquiere \" with actual scorn. Now, in the then state of things, such a line of conduct was fraught with intolerable evils."], [158, "122 VENICE. Had the military habits been free from licen- tiousness, then indeed would the degradation of commerce have been attended with conse- quences less fatal, than those in which he soon found himself involved. But, Napoleon was par- tial and unjust \u2014 a capricious upstart\u2014 in many instances, a tyrant \u2014 possessing less ofthe univer- sal ken of the eagle, than of the limited vision ofthe hawk ; more ofthe cunning ofthe lawyer, than of the sterling wisdom of the legislator ; thereby proclaiming himself, as it were, the true son of the attorney of Ajaccio. Such was the fatal misprision of his system of civil govern ment, that his whole kingdom, nay, all Europe, became a sort of general barrack, a garrison, a species of tented field, subject to martial regu lations. The military mania spread far and wide ; and thus were the locusts, the harpies, the sluggards, permitted to nestle and swarm amidst a miserable population, unable to resist their insufferable vexations, and incapable of appeasing their manifold cravings \u2014 whether of external vanity and parade, or of vitiated and depraved appetite. Throughout France, every thing appeared to be done for the accommodation of the army. Her theatres, her public walks, her coffee-houses, her restaurateurs, and her gardens, all served as"], [159, "123 VENICE. so many focuses of recreation for the officers. Ask for a breakfast at a Paris hotel, and the waiter will fetch it for you from the neighbour ing cafe. Indeed, there is hardly any such thing in France as an English fireside \u2014 a home ! Strangers of moderate fortune, in passing through Paris, resort to coffee-houses and traiteurs for their meals ; as they generally find it more comfortable to do so than to take them at their lodgings. Frenchmen, it is true, are fond of society to an extreme ; great.babblers ; and more occupied with other people's concerns than with their own domestic affairs, which they leave almost entirely to the ladies. This rage for gadding about, and gossipping, and making visits, is more or less prevalent all over the Continent ; and by it the mental ener gies become greatly exhausted. Nor can I exone rate a considerable portion of my fair country women from the like imputation. Nay, the very trees and houses in France partake of the same gregarious character. In Burgundy, for instance, and in several other provinces, many a fertile spot is to be seen, upon which, for seven or eight miles together, not a rustic hut or shed is to be discovered, nor any signs of social life ; although the deserted fields are abundant in the productions of Ceres and"], [160, "124 VENICE. Pomona ; reminding one of those fairy tales, which describe the sudden appearance of sump tuous banquets magically raised, without the intervention of human agency, and only wit nessed by the sweet warblers of the grove. In a moment, however, we arrive at some populous city ; and, straight, the face of every thing be comes changed ! As for the trees, we find them huddled together in clumps, in small woods, or, soldier- like, in rank and file, and in platoons. Geometrical figures, of all shapes and sizes, are rigidly adhered to, in the laying out of their groves and gardens, by the French planters of the leafy tribe. Nature, which ought \" never to be forgot,\" is entirely lost sight of. All is formal \u2014 all is monotonous \u2014 all is stiff \u2014 No pleasing intricacies intervene, \" No artful wildness to perplex the scene ; \" Grove nods at grove, each alley has a brother, And half the platform just reflects the other.\" What shocked me most, undei the Napoleon sway, was the intrusion of the soldiery, dressed in full uniform, up to the very altars of the churches : an impious, daring, and most odious custom this, which now, or at least very recently, was permitted by his Imperial Majesty of Aus tria. While every one is kneeling before the"], [161, "125 VENICE. image of God, and intent upon his worship, neither by genuflexion, nor by the taking off of caps, nor by any other outward signs of devotion, do the soldiery join in the ceremony ! Some slight inclination of the body may possibly take place, on the elevation of the host ; but that, I believe, is all. These irreverent practices were especially observed by the French, in the time of their Emperor ; and the Germans, in Italy, have not been behind -hand in follow ing the example ; to the great scandal of true religion. Why admit soldiers, or indeed any one, into their sanctuaries, who will not consent to adhere to the prescribed ritual ? Surely no reasonable mortal can object to uncover his head, in a place consecrated to the worship of the Supreme Being, when the rest of the audience are all doing the same. As for the impious remark of intoxicated presumption, that soldiers should obey no orders but those of their General, and that the practice I am reprobating has been in vogue time immemorial, I need only refer to the natural disposition of the soul upon ven turing into battle, and that involuntary recourse in spirit, to the God of Battles, which takes place during the existence of imminent danger, whether by sea or land. The most eminent of"], [162, "126 VENICE. heroes have, in all ages, discovered the pro soundest reverence for the Deity ; and, in proof of the correctness of my assertion, I could adduce recent instances, from the conduct of some of our own most distinguished naval and military commanders. But to return to the views and projects of Napoleon. His eagle, as I before said, was a hawk. That Roman expansive ken, and that great ness of soul, which none of the other powers of Europe at all understood, the French failed to attain. The mind of their chief, cramped in a great degree by local admeasurements, and narrowed by constant calculations and the details of a field of battle, passed over other interests of paramount importance. All classes of the community were rendered subordinate to his troops ; as if the profession of arms was alone deserving of notice \u2014 thereby proving him self to be a soldier, and little or nothing beyond it. Whatever his demonstrations to the contrary may have been, there can scarcely be a doubt, that his talents were chiefly confined to the science of war. A sovereign should strive to be like the Almighty \u2014 wise, impartial, true, beneficent, and just. Now, without stopping to inquire in what degree the divine attributes here enumerated"], [163, "VENICE. 127 were or were not discoverable in the actions of the individual in question, I shall, for the present, only advert to the third ; namely, his love of truth .- and although the vox populi is not in all instances the vox Dei \u2014 there being but a very slender portion of celestial intelli gence shed over the minds of the multitude \u2014 yet, in the common opinion, which charges Buo naparte with a total indifference to this God-like quality, I in a great measure acquiesce. And his extraordinary abilities only serve to aggra vate his guilt ; since talent is the knowledge of truth, and a gift of God : consequently the suppression of the boon is a flying in the face of the Great Giver. His deceitful and crafty policy \u2014 that evil spirit, whose deadly influence appears to pervade the great mass of society \u2014 low, and corrupt, and base, and wretched as it is, clung to him to the last. It is my conscientious conviction, that the sole drift of his outrageous hostility against Sir Hudson Lowe, the vigilant Governor of St. Helena, was to stir up a commotion in the island. Had he succeeded in gaining a free intercourse with the garrison, he would next have tampered with the officers. Neither have I the charity to suppose that he would not have so far succeeded in seducing"], [164, "128 VENICE. some qf them, as to have weakened, to a certain degree, their allegiance to their own Sovereign. Not that I entertain the least doubt of the fidelity of British officers. Nevertheless, in what way a constant intercourse at St. Helena with such a man as the tremendous Napoleon \u2014 a de posed Emperor too ! \u2014 united to his consummate skill in fathoming character, might have ope rated on individuals of his own profession, it would be difficult to predict. Many a man has passed for a traitor, merely because he has been unable to refuse a solicited favour, to every ap pearance trivial, but in reality rendered very important from circumstances. His hour was however come. The man who had entangled myriads in his snares \u2014 the man who had allured thousands by the melody of his promises \u2014 was at length caught in the very toils which he had himself invented. As the bar barous Muscovite learnt of Charles XII. of Sweden the mode of waging war, so were Napoleon's political tactics most sedulously studied, and most closely imitated. And, accordingly, he was at last taken by the same subtle and mellifluous contrivance of holiday promises. England was held up as the sole asylum for downcast sovereigns \u2014 the sanc tuary of safety \u2014 the city of refuge \u2014 the harbour"], [165, "129 VENICE. of repose, and security, and freedom. Witness the Bourbons, and his own brother Lucien, and many others. Napoleon, therefore, fearlessly ascended the Bellerophon. But it turned out a monster to devour him. It was no chimera ! All, alas, was sad reality ; both as it regarded the remainder of his brief existence, as well as its awfully instruc tive termination \u2014 \" Mors solafatetur, Quantula sint hominum corpuscula .'\" CHAPTER XIV. VENICE. The Subject continued The Holy Alliance described Return to the Condition qf Italy under the Austrian yoke Impracticability qf assimilating the German and Italian character. Having said thus much with regard to the policy of Napoleon, it will naturally be expected that I should next touch upon the conduct of those who have succeeded him in the govern ment of the affairs of Europe. The reader must not, however, expect me to enter too minutely into a subject, which, at every turn, is VOL. I. K"], [166, "130 VENICE. fraught with so much inconvenience, \u2014 disclaim ing, as I do, certain personalities. Let the base reptiles remain in their lurking holes, for the present : only the ostensible personages shall be now noticed by me. \" The Holy Alliance !\" How awful, how presumptuous, the appellation ! Trenching closely on the attributes of Divinity itself ; and thereby challenging inquiry, how far they deserve the assumed Vicegerency. As far as my limited faculties enable me to form a judgment, the labours of this alliance have tended, hitherto, to rivet more closely the chains forged for the sufferers by their Corsican oppressor. The \" holy\" copartnership proclaim, that their prerogatives do not emanate from the people, but come down upon them, like the mantle of Elijah, from the Godhead itself! Good. And therefore am I the more completely justified in balancing against the divine attri butes which they assume, the actual conduct of the several potentates who are parties to the said holy \u2014 most holy \u2014 alliance ! But, where should I find language sufficiently powerful to convey to my reader the actual result of such an inquiry ? On one hand, the arrogance of the creature, and his feeble and imperfect and confined and variable notions of"], [167, "131 VENICE. things the most simple ! On the other hand, the God of Nature, who\u2014 \" Though chang'd in all, is still in all the same, Great in the earth as in th' ethereal frame; Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees; Lives through all life, extends through all extent ; Spreads undivided, operates unspent; Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part, As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart; As full, as perfect, in vile Man that mourns, As the rapt seraph that adores and burns ; To Him no high, no low, no great, no small; He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.\" These sublunary monarchs, with their hun dred eyes, are incessantly on the watch, pry ing about, lest any of their bondsmen should escape their vigilance, and devising innume rable projects to shut out the rays of truth ; whereas, the Almighty lives in light \u2014 \" for God is light; And never but in unapproached light, Dwelt from eternity.\" The most artful impediments have been thrown, by these monarchs, in the way of every individual who may, at any time, have been anxious to promote the genuine happiness of mankind. Every such individual has been k 2"], [168, "132 VENICE. branded as a jacobin, a demagogue, a ruffian, a rebel. The foulest slanders have been heaped upon his head. He trembles at the atrocious injustice which he experiences at the hands of mortals who have usurped to themselves the characteristics of divinity ; and, though feeling a consciousness of his ability to re-invigorate the fallen energies of his countrymen, and to restore to them the blessings which they have forfeited, as much by feebleness as by direct corruption \u2014 such a phalanx of demons uprear their furious crests in terrific array before him\u2014 such innu merable difficulties and dangers beset him in his path \u2014 that he stops short appalled ; and, without giving a free utterance to his indignant feelings, he leaves it to God, in his own good time, to speed the righteous work, through the operation of his Almighty power. After reflections like these, the mind involun tarily turns to the condition of Italy, as I have pourtrayed that condition in the early pages of this volume ; and, if I were to confine myself to the present state of the Venetian territory, the observations which it would be my duty to make thereon would apply equally to the rest of the newly acquired German dominions. The same unfeeling schemes of plunder are every where pursued ; many of them introduced by the"], [169, "133 VENICE. French, those ministers of rapine, and continued since their defeat, under various pretexts \u2014 exactions, grievous in point of substance, and galling beyond measure to the feelings ; trea chery ; a false representation of things ; expres sions replete with the semblance of compassion, but, in reality, altogether hollow and delusive. Instead of genuine sympathy, accompanied with positive redress, some new device is con stantly resorted to, to increase the sufferings of the miserable Italians ; absolutely forcing upon their memories the language of Scripture. The German tyrants seem to be aware that their power can be but of short duration ; and there fore are they striving to make the most of it. Be that as it may, the wretched sufferers ex claim, that \" Satan has overtaken them in great wrath.\" Venice, once the emporium of all Eu rope, is become a \" waste howling wilderness.\" The rapid disappearance, within the space of a few years, of the immense treasures of that city, announces an entire dislocation of society and a total defacement of her beautiful edifices, at no very distant period, if her present masters should persevere in the harsh and unfeeling conduct towards her, which they have hitherto adopted. It is unmanly and base, it is cruel and infamous, to trample thus on the prostrate K 3"], [170, "134 VENICE. victim, reduced to the extreme of languor, by protracted and accumulated misfortunes. Let us, however, hope for better days ; and that the sun of England's glory will, ere long, extend a portion of its generous rays to depressed Italy ! Indeed, I cannot help entertaining a belief, that the friends of suffering humanity will not relax an iota of their exertions, until the entire of that magnificent country shall have had its injuries redressed \u2014 a country, compared with which the much vaunted France is a mere warren, a cheerless desert, a bleak and hungry waste. Not that I mean to represent the latter kingdom as a barren wilderness, if duly cul tivated : I only wish to throw out, that France, and, generally speaking, the soil of all the other countries of Europe, are sterile, when brought in competition with Venetian Lombardy, and other portions of the territory of the former Queen of the terraqueous globe. During the summer season, almost every tree in it is loaded with fruit of the most delicious quality. In despite of neglect, and of obstacles of all sorts, the earth teems with every blessing which Pro vidence, in his bounty, has bestowed on his creatures ; and that in such abundance, as to astonish every traveller coming from beyond the Alps."], [171, "135 V E N I C E. But, \" for whose use,\" I ask, is the sky of Italy so pure \u2014 its air so mild and serene \u2014 its earth so prolific ? Hear the answer of Austria : 'Tis for mine ; For me kind Nature wakes her genial pow'r, Suckles each herb, and spreads out ev'ry flow'r ; Annual for me the grape, the rose, renew The juice nectarious, and the balmy dew ; For me the mine a thousand treasures brings, For me health gushes from a thousand springs ; Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise ; My footstool earth, my canopy the skies.\" O, what delightful country seats could the English, with their excellent taste for laying out grounds, erect in Italy ; where it is quite common to see bowers formed of the lime- tree and the vine, bending under a superabundant product ! In proof of my assertion, I ap peal to every one who has been fortunate enough to see the grounds of the English gentry settled in Italy ; for instance, the gardens of my friend and countrywoman, the Countess de Durfort, who resides at a short distance from Venice. And then, again, as to paintings and the other productions of the fine arts ; more of them are to be met with in any one of the great cities of Italy \u2014 Rome, Florence, Venice, &c, k 4"], [172, "136 VENICE. than in all France \u2014 throwing Germany into the bargain ! To behold regions on every side thus rich and populous, groaning under a yoke forged for them by hordes of drowsy, lubberly Aus trians, who come down in droves from the Tyrolean mountains, at all seasons of the year, with packs on their backs, containing scarcely a second garment, to the dismay of the poor Italian, who therein foresees, with renewed anguish, the augmentation of his own miseries, and the metamorphosis, in the space of two or three years, of these beggarly intruders, into stern, and hard-hearted, and wealthy pro prietors \u2014 to behold, I say, this fine, intelligent people mixed up with the dull, clod-hopping Germans, reminds one of the amalgamation of lead with quicksilver ; the jumbling together of masses the most heterogeneous. We often hear of the marriage of a beautiful and accomplished female to a clumsy boor or a drunken sot ; and of the union of a man of sober disposition and enlightened understanding with a fiery virago, a very Zantippe, who stamps and storms about the house, while the worthy husband is calmly occupied in solving some difficult problem ap pertaining to the regions of intellect \u2014 recalling to our recollection the actual existence of the"], [173, "137 VENICE. iron age, and the wars of the Titans against heaven \u2014 the attempt, in short, to repress and subdue spirit by gross and inert matter. Of the various nations of Europe, the Ger mans are the most doltish, the Italians the most sprightly ; and the approximation of the two affords a fresh instance of the contact which frequently takes place between extremes. Such a state of things, however, is never lasting. Either an amelioration of condition, or an en tire separation between the parties must take place. And, confident I am, that the very first Englishman who shall fly to the rescue of the fair dames of Italy, will find them impatient for flight, and eager to escape from the tobacco fumes, and the gin, and the sauer kroute, and the other German messes ; not to mention the innu merable restraints, past all endurance, imposed on them by their detested paramours. For my part, I am at all times inclined to trust very much to national character ; and, as Englishmen are well known to be as prompt in lending their assistance to suffering humanity, as they are alive to the slightest rumour of delin quency, we may reasonably look for the bene ficial interference of the British Government, as soon as it shall become truly instructed*, with respect to the real condition of Italy, and"], [174, "138 VENICE. the miserable plight to which a horde of unre lenting tyrants have reduced her, by their unheard-of cruelties and their most atrocious exactions. CHAPTER XV. VENICE. German Attempts to improve Italian Edifices Enumeration qf the Distresses occasioned at Venice by the wretched state ofthe Coinage. Only the other year all Venice was in a state of agitation, from the Austrians having taken it into their precious noddles to place the entire city on fresh legs. In other words, the wise acres discovered, that some of the houses stood in need of new foundations. And, sure enough, the streets have assumed an appearance at once straight, formal, and monotonous \u2014 stiff as a file of musketeers, and (to give Old Nick his due) certainly somewhat more cleanly than they were accustomed to be. But, why these same external alterations should have been set on foot, while the means of replenishing the inside of the habitations were unfeelingly with-"], [175, "139 VENICE. held, is a point only to be cleared up by a reference to the uniform policy of Francis's predecessor ; namely, the obliterating of an cient forms, and the thereby paving the way for impressions of a different description. For such an undertaking, excuses would not of course be wanted. The leading one was, that the inhabitants were in constant danger of having their houses tumbled about their ears. We often see this propping and shoring work, on a small scale, going on in the purlieus of Covent Garden, and in sundry parts of our metropolis, where it has really been called for ; but, in Venice, where the walls ofthe houses are extremely stout and substantial, and where no horses or waggons are moving to and fro to shake them, the undertaking alluded to only served to increase, if possible, the general odium in which the Germans were already held by the people of that city. Whatever your barbarians cannot mend, they uniformly take especial care to mar. For instance, the public buildings which, in the glorious time of the Republic, were as free of access as the churches, or nearly so, are now closed against the people, and can only be visited through the medium of a fee. Admittance to the Ducal Palace, which is a suite of saloons, the walls"], [176, "140 VENICE. and ceilings of which still glow with the pro ductions of Titian, Paulo Veronese, Tintoretto, and other inimitable masters, presenting a source of the purest delight to persons of taste and science, has been interdicted by these animals, who have no relish for these noble and sublime specimens of genius. Talk of the Goths and the Vandals ! their barbarism might perhaps have shewn itself in shapes of greater ferocity ; but I verily believe, that their yoke was not accompanied with more direful consequences, than those which the German sway will ultimately produce through out Italy. The \" paternal \" government of His Imperial Majesty is ostentatiously boasted of on every public occasion. His extreme so licitude, and that of the individuals employed under him, for the general good, is pompously trumpeted forth, whenever an opportunity presents itself; while facts, of the most damn ing description, give the lie to the averment. Nakedness, and poverty, and beggary, are hydras which might, at least, silence these unfeeling men. But no : the obstinacy of the dolts is proverbial, and the Italians in their employ (chiefly strangers to the city, or if born in it, persons of no character or note) acquiesce in all their measures. Indeed, the crafty Ger-"], [177, "141 VENICE. mans take care to give it out, that every one of the grievances which the people are made to endure, is not suggested by themselves, but is the work of some of their own countrymen. I was myself informed by Count Thurn, the Delegato, or sub-governor of Venice, with an air of great regard for the person named, who the projector was of the recent repairs of the foundations above-mentioned. The name I have forgotten ; but I could readily discover, that the object was to induce a belief, that neither the Count himself, nor any of his col leagues, had the least hand in the business. And, similar tricks are but too generally resorted to \u2014 the executive sending forth its mandates from a masked battery, which no mortal is per mitted to explore. At Venice, the people pronounce the go vernor to be in faidt ; the canaille cry out shame on the sovereign ; while others, who affect to be more in the secret, impeach, by name, some two or three of the counsellors of state ; who probably, after all, enjoy a smaller portion of influence than those who are kept more in the back-ground. Sometimes the civil, at others the military authorities are condemned ; and, to wind up the \" sad eventful history,\" the wretched citizens of Venice are heartily sick"], [178, "142 VENICE. of their numerous oppressors, and, in the bitter ness of disappointment, wish both soldiers and sailors, commissaries and counsellors of state, aulic as well as hydraulic, who, one and all, strive only how they can best fleece them out of their last shilling \u2014 at the very devil. By hook or by crook, however, an enormous revenue is collected by Austria in the Venetian territories. From Padua, a boat-load of money is every Saturday evening conveyed to Venice ; whence it is forwarded, as may naturally be presumed, to Germany ; since none of it ever finds its way back ; and thus are the inhabitants drained to the last extreme of endurance ! Certain it is, that the Germans are held, throughout Italy, in greater dislike than the French ever were. The latter, though rapacious after money, spent it freely ; whereas, the former are the most niggardly race of mortals on the face of the earth, and even grudge to lay out twopence for a cup of coffee. In fine, the whole body of the Government are indifferent to the happiness and well-being of the people, and are only solicitous to amass fortunes for themselves. Some idea of the calamitous system pursued at Venice may be readily formed from the fol lowing well-attested facts, which relate only to"], [179, "143 VENICE. a solitary branch of the accursed tree, which seems destined to shroud in eternal night the re nowned Venetian Commonwealth. The regulations with regard to money \u2014 that primum mobile in the projects of political eno nomists \u2014 bear with a distressing weight on the poor of Venice, and tend to keep alive inces sant jars and wranglings between the shop keepers and the inhabitants ; to encourage fraud ; to facilitate swindling ; and to keep the city, from one end to the other, in a constant state of perplexity, irritation and confusion. Indeed, all the surrounding districts are alike a prey to the same diabolical contrivance \u2014 than which it would scarcely be possible to invent any thing more completely calculated to excite the furies of discord. And, alas ! while the native gulls are whirled and tossed about in the common tempest, the master sharks are seen revelling in every species of wanton luxury ! If any superficial observer should be inclined to suppose the mischief venial, because it only alights on those whom he may be pleased to call the inferior classes of society, I do not envy that person either his head or his heart. To come, however, to the point : every city pos sesses its tribe of money-changers ; but, in Venice the race is more numerous than in any"], [180, "144 VENICE. other ; and the cause is to be found in the nu merous abuses connived at, both there and in the surrounding districts. For a dollar of five franks \u2014 and little else but dollars of different mints are in circulation \u2014 no shopkeeper will give you small change, unless you will lay out a third of it in articles ; since the small cur rency bears an agio of no less than nearly five farthings upon a Napoleon crown, worth four shillings and twopence. Either, therefore, three or four livres (I am speaking, of course, of the Venetian livre, in value fivepence) must be spent at a single shop, out of the five-frank piece, or recourse must be had to the money changer ; who charges you two and a-half per cent, for so doing, more or less, according to the state of the exchange, the quality of the coin, or his own good pleasure. As for the vast diversity of coins in circula tion at Venice, each bearing a separate value, one would think they were brought thither from every corner of the globe, in order still further to annoy and perplex the wretched in habitants. The different kinds of German dol lars would alone form a moderate-sized collec tion ; and the sagacity of Midas himself would be puzzled to ascertain the intrinsic value of each. If, indeed, a plentiful supply of these"], [181, "145 VENICE. coins were seen flowing into the costers of the Venetians, the mischief would comparatively be trifling ; but the reverse of this happens, unfor tunately, to be the case. Two prices therefore prevail, with reference to the small coin \u2014 the nominal, and the real ; and the consequence is, that the poor man almost invariably hies with his dollar to the money-changer, since he is not able to expend three livres, nor even two, at a single shop ; and it is not for the interest of the shopkeeper, on account of the said agio, to give change, unless goods to the amount of three livres should be purchased. I have frequently seen a Chevalier d' Industrie call for his cup of coffee, which costs about two pence, and in payment thereof throw down a five-frank piece. The waiter, of course, cannot give change, as the loss by so doing would amount to more than the cost of the cup of coffee. Upon this, the furbone, after rapping out some half dozen score of oaths at the state of the money-market, repockets his crown-piece, and walks off without paying for his coffee. Others present a zecchino, worth above five-and twenty livres ; by which,' however, the loss is not so great, since a couple of five-frank pieces and a livre or two, will about make up the sum. But the coffee-house keeper does not comply, VOL. I. L"], [182, "146 VENICE. unless he happens to have Spanish, or some crowns of the same value, to give ; having constantly an eye to the agio borne by the smaller coin. Verily, all this is most distressing work ! Fruit-stalls, and such like minor vents for com modities, present similar scenes of anxiety and irritation ; and thus are places, which ought to be scenes of cheerfulness and of tranquillity, as was wont to be the case in the happy days of the Republic, converted into so many dens of harpies, feverish, wrathful, and miserable ; and mainly through the pecuniary shackles of which I have been speaking. After the emplette, or bargain, has been struck, it is quite common, because the poor salesman cannot afford to give change, to see the articles flung back into the basket, to the loss of his custom, the damage of his wares, and his own bitter mortification ! From the above specimen, my reader will be able to form a pretty correct notion of what is called the Austrian government in Italy. If, in the agony of his spirit, the Venetian should venture upon a remonstrance, the only redress he obtains is some coarse German vulgarism ; some common-place rebuke expressed in a tone of bluff asperity ; some threat calculated to terrify him. Nor, indeed, is it to be expected"], [183, "VENICE. 147 that those, whom the countless drubbings of the French have only served to render more proud and more brutal, should be troubled with any of the \" compunctuous visitings\" of nature. \" Beat out one devil, and you let in ten,\" is an old saying, which may justly be applied to them. Invariably obstinate, the Germans main tain that they never were beaten by Napoleon ; every untoward mischance they attribute to treachery. So true is it, that beings endowed with a certain crassitude of skull, cannot com prehend the power of intellect ; nor how it comes to pass, that ability and skill can achieve certain deeds, and the operations of mind pre vail over those of gross matter. Treachery may have done a little ; but the reader may rest assured, that it was by talent and by spirit that the victory was achieved. The expenses of the improvements which have recently taken place in the streets of Venice the proprietors of the houses have been compelled to defray. And thus has many a landlord forfeited his inheritance, together with the scanty annuity which he had saved out of the general wreck, and to which he looked up for his support in old age. Capital as well as interest, tenement as well as rent, have alike l 2"], [184, "148 VENICE. been raked into the gulph of unbounded avarice ; and thus has many an honest and humble indi vidual been deprived of his last shilling ! CHAPTER XVI. VENICE. Reflections on Architecture generally Its Origin The Grecian Style Palmyra The Egyptian Column Necessity qf a Petrific Standard, of Antiquity St. Paul's Cathedral Of Cupolas State qf Architecture in Eng- land compared with that qf Italy The Palace ofthe Doge. Every one who attempts to describe Italy, must necessarily speak of the magnificence of its buildings, and, par consequence, ofthe beauty of its paintings, its sculpture, and its architec ture. Those travellers, therefore, who slur over their account of the arts, which adorn and beautify at every step that classic ground, ought at once to confess their incompetency for the task, rather than plead as their excuse the \" fine descriptions\" which have already been published to the world by former visitors. These"], [185, "VENICE. 149 descriptions may possibly be \" fine :\" but, for my part, I must ingenuously confess, that I have hitherto seen no luminous account, either of the paintings, the sculpture, or the architecture of Italy, from the pen of a veritable homme de lettres. Certain artists, possessing very clear ideas, are often incapable of committing those ideas to paper. And if, in the course of the observations I am about to make, some great names should be subjected to a scrutiny, which may appear to detract from a celebrity of many centuries' standing, I can only say, that, in the task I have undertaken, my only aim has been, faithfully to impress upon the minds of others, those sentiments which are deeply engraven on my own. To begin with architecture. The first habi tations for man must, like the dens of wild beasts, or the nests of birds, have been intended to serve for shelter from the wet, the cold, the wind, and from intense heat ; as well as to guard against wolves, tigers, and other savage animals during the night. Let us imagine three or four trees growing close to each other : they might soon be formed into an enclosure, trian gular or square, by means of sheets of basket or wicker- work, made of the boughs of the said trees. A roof or canopy would follow, con- l 3"], [186, "150 VENICE. structed likewise of the produce of the forest, always adhering to the gifts of Providence ; and, accordingly, the covering afforded by the oak and other trees would suggest the invention of different shapes, for a lid or dome to the new edifice, to preserve the area from becoming a swamp. The annual plumations of the feathery tribe, and the wool and hair of quadrupeds collected together, would be sufficient to insure a comfortable retreat to man in his savage state. When his views began to expand, he would then turn his thoughts towards the erection of some nobler fabric \u2014 a temple, perchance, for the worship of his God, or a dwelling for his chieftain. Ornaments, of a higher nature than any hitherto attempted would then be set about ; and, step by step, the art would insen sibly improve. In the best era of architecture, security against the perils incidental to the convulsions of nature, whether by tempest or earthquake, was the primary object. Symmetry and orna ment followed next in the train. In the first ages of society, temples were sought after by the people, as places of refuge in moments of peril, whether arising from war, from contagious diseases, or from the howling of the storm. And, in accordance with this principle, we trace"], [187, "VENICE. 151 in the Egyptian, Assyrian, and other remains of the most remote antiquity, the features I have here traced. Trees were felled, and a portion of the trunks were fixed into the earth. They were thus arranged at equal distances, and upon their summits, coequal in height, and flat, were placed other masses of wood, made square, form- ing the architrave. That a pillar or column, tapering as it ascends, was fashioned originally from the shape of the shaft or body of a tree, is a position which, I believe, no one will be inclined to dispute. It is fluted or plain, fo- liated, and indented, obliquely or otherwise, according to the taste of the workman but, rotundity was always its leading form : to deviate therefrom was to shock and disgust ; and it upholds those parts which project, such as vestibules, corridors, and passages for the people. The capital swells. So with trees : at the place where the main arms branch out from the trunk, the same would be found to be the case if a recision were made immediately over the said juncture \u2014 a triforked appearance, suffi- cient to justify the architect in transferring the practice from wood to more durable marble, by tumifying the pillar at the head or top. And, in giving to the plinth, or base, a rib, he is justi fied by a reference to the root of the tree, when l 4"], [188, "152 VENICE. cleared of its ruggedness, and made smooth like a ring or hoop. The Grecians appear to have established their theories respecting the column, upon this prin ciple of nature; which principle, however, might long, very long before, have been in use by other nations. The Egyptians adopted a trunk in its original state, with scarcely any pedestal, the root of the tree being embosomed in the earth : a style of column which is eminently strong and lasting. The ornaments at the capital are light and playful, adhering in this also to nature : for there the leaves commence, and there would very probably remain a few sprays and some foliage at the summit of the trunk ; a circumstance which, I have no doubt, gave rise to the carvings, which have subsequently been diversified, so as to include the plants or flowers growing in the vicinity, varied and modified according to the taste of the builder. Again, if we take the appearance of a forest, the natural resort of certain animals in quest of tbod and repose, we find the lower branches in a perfectly horizontal position. A hint this, by which the early architects appear to have pro fited ; their buildings having the appearance of so many groves : a repetition of the letter T., with at each end an I. And that this method"], [189, "153 VENICE. of building is best calculated for duration we readily discover, from the vetust remains still standing in the plains of Asia and Africa. Cities acquire new names from the political caprice of the conqueror, oi*from some ridicu lous lingual innovation. That Zenobia may have been a sovereign in the possession of some power, I am not disposed to deny ; but as to that queen having been the founder of Palmyra, I cannot listen to the absurd conjecture : not that I entirely reject the accounts, which award her the merit of augmenting the splendour of that city. At what period Persepolis was built, and by what people, are facts of which we are entirely ignorant. The Egyptian column is never, in the smallest degree, contracted at the base, like those of Greece, of Rome, and of modern Europe. The number of ages which have elapsed since the construction of some of the massy edifices to be found in that country, might probably have been guessed at, if, five hundred years ago, some petrific standard, exposed to the atmosphere, had been agreed upon, similar to the one adopted in the case of decayed monuments. From the results in the former instance, the pitch of remoteness might, with some degree of accuracy, have been guessed at, with respect to"], [190, "154 VENICE. the latter\"; about which such innumerable theories have been put forth, and all of them equally unworthy of credit. Neither vault, nor arch, nor dome, was admitted into their struc tures. The circle was to be found no where, but in the prop or pillar, and in their hierogly phics. The western front of St. Paul's Cathedral in London, is most unquestionably splendid, and, according to my taste, nearly perfect. The pillars which are seen supporting the dome are, however, inadmissible upon any established principle ; unless we may consider them to be trees rooted midway up the mountain, and that cavities in the rocks were the primitive asylums osman. Of cupolas \u2014 and I have seen every one worth looking at \u2014 that of the cathedral of which I have last been speaking is, to my taste, the most beautiful. The crying blunder however is, that the arched windows are made subordinate to the square ones ; that airy lightness is placed beneath rectangular stability : for thus the prin ciple of strength is violated. To range insu lated columns, in situations where trunks of trees can by no possibility be made to grow, is an anomaly in architecture. Therefore the stout plank, or split pillar, with its foliated"], [191, "155 VENICE. capital should, as it appears to me, be exclu sively appropriated to second or third tiers or stories ; the curves to keep increasing even up to the circle, as the building ascends. And here again we have authority. The luminous orbs of heaven meet the sight when the eye looks up : and therefore, in architecture, ought the arch, the oval, and the sphere to find their sta tions aloft. The temple of Minerva at Athens, and other early magnificent erections, put the spectator in remembrance of a grove ; a horizon tal line is described by the termination ofthe leaves, while the bodies of the trees are the columns. In England, the science of architecture is amazingly confined. The houses of private individuals are as painfully similar to each other, as if an immutable decree had regulated their figure and dimensions. A few lordly habitations are indeed exempt from this peculiarity : but, as for a noble, stately, hospitable-looking stair case, it is so rare a thing, that the owner of the mansion seems to have had no very strong in clination that any of his guests should, undi rected, find their way through, or even into, the premises. In very few houses can the stairs be readily found. But the spirit for society in this country is very limited ; and, to say the truth, not without reason ; if we are to credit"], [192, "156 VENICE. the reports, as to the demoralized state of the mass of the population. Be this as it may, a secluded, domestic life is, after all, in times like the present, undoubtedly the best. But\u2014 do our English males, of the higher and the lower classes, live much in the bosoms of their fami lies ? I confess I should pause, before I ven tured to answer in the affirmative. On the contrary, in Italy, a noble staircase, and stately and spacious saloons, were indispen sable features in the palace of every patrician \u2014 at least it was so in Venice ; and this for pretty obvious reasons. The entire aristocracy amount ed to about nine hundred or a thousand families ; and, as they all became equal, from the moment their title deeds were enrolled in the Libro d'Oro, and were all liable to be appointed to high situations, it was imperative on each of them, when so appointed, to send round invita tions to the rest. No private grudge was ever suffered to interfere with this politic measure. There was no limitation or exemption \u2014 nothing paltry, nor personally offensive, nor invidious. And thus was this noble body, by frequent meetings and collisions of this sort, not only made cheerful by entertainments and diversions, but cemented more closely together by the cap tivating smiles of urbanity, and the pleasures of"], [193, "157 VENICE. the banquet. The married ladies were always invited, but le nubili never. To accommo date so numerous an assembly, it was therefore necessary that the saloons should be spacious. Even on the upper stories it was usual to fit up capacious apartments. The entertainments at Venice consisted neither ofa dinner nor supper. There was a cold collation, a sort of deje-une a lafourchette, con sisting of every delicacy and rarity ; as those who were in affluent circumstances spared no expense upon these public occasions, either in the way of parade or of luxury. The magnificent palace of the Doge, in the Piazza di San Marco, is raised upon pillars ; but the design having been considered too bold, from the number of vaults or arches, the ground about was raised, so as to encroach somewhat on the building, thereby sinking it a trifle, and the centre ones were filled up. At first, how ever, this wonderful edifice stood upon columns, having the appearance of a forest of trees."], [194, "158 CHAPTER XVII. VENICE.

I shall now offer a few wd\u00a3ds on some of the most magnificent edifices to be seen in this most singular and beautiful city. The Basilica, or church of San Marco, was begun in the year 977. and finished, in the superb style in which we now behold it, in 1071. It has ten outer gates of Corinthian brass, be sides five more within, of the same material, all richly ornamented ; and between them there is a gallery, or piazza, for the people to prome nade in. Roofs, walls, pavement \u2014 the whole of the interior of this stupendous temple, is inlaid with mosaics, in gold and colours, or adorned with"], [195, "VENICE. 159 the finest marbles. On entering, and lifting our eyes towards the dome, we at once be hold so immense a number of paintings, of the description here mentioned, in the different ceilings, curves, arches, and niches, that it would be impossible to give a sketch of them ; each however is accompanied with an explana tory description. The first artists have all been employed in embellishing its walls. Tintoretto's cartoons have principally served to direct the artificers of these splendid mosaics ; but many of them are from designs of a much earlier date. Amidst a multitude of other pillars, all carved out of precious materials, and many of them brought from Constantinople when the Venetians con quered that city, are eight columns of a serpen tine shape, carried originally from Jerusalem, and which are said to have adorned the famous temple of Solomon. Both within and without, are to be seen beautiful pillars, of every kind of rare marble, magnificently piled and arranged, though rather according to the Saracenic taste. Upon the corridor, surmounting the archi trave in front, are placed the famous four steeds, in Corinthian brass, of unparalleled merit. The action of the gentle trot has been caught by the artist, and every muscle of these"], [196, "160 VENICE. noble creatures has been displayed with such prodigious felicity, that if their golden sur faces could be converted into the silky gloss of nature, the animals might be supposed to move. They are generally believed to be the work manship ofthe celebrated Lysippus, the Greek sculptor, and they certainly leave all modern attempts at equestrian statues at an immeasur able distance. As I have spoken of one much talked of pub lic ornament, perhaps I shall be excused if I briefly advert to another. I mean the magnificent bronze figure recently erected in Hyde-Park, and given out tobe that of Achilles. But, for what reason that personage, who is no where repre sented by Homer as being fond of retiring, should be considered to be pourtrayed in the statue in question, I think it would be difficult to imagine. On Monte Cavallo, at Rome, where the original is still standing, this noble figure is represented as managing a fiery steed ; thereby intending to intimate the power of intelligence in man, over brute matter, and even over his own appetites \u2014 in short, an emblem denoting the superiority of mind over body. Certain persons have, I know, an inexpressible aversion to the figure, and are for having it taken away altogether. Thank God, I am not"], [197, "161 VENICE. formed in so fastidious a mould. I would, how ever, recommend to our arbiters of taste the immediate removal of the shield, and the intro duction of the animal ; as the unaccountable anomaly which now presents itself would then be done away with. The figure actually appears to be recoiling, and drawing itself away from some portentous emanation from above ; where as, its attitude and the expression of its counte nance accord admirably with the rearing up of the animal. Moreover, both hands are suited to the action of holding a bridle. In short, it cannot be Achilles ; for neither hand is seen wielding a weapon. If he be sup posed to be fighting with men, a figure of such colossal magnitude would not be looking up wards. If he be warring with the gods, then adieu, Master Hyde-park Achilles ! You cannot be Homer's hero ; for he was \" the beloved of Jove\"\u2014 \" And, to the Gods resign'd, To reason gave the empire ofhis mind.\" The Piazza di San Marco is a vast area, com prizing the most splendid, or at least the richest, piles of architecture in the universe. It is about as large as Lincoln's-Inn-Fields ; but, vol. 1. M"], [198, "162 VENICE. heavens, how different ! It has, in part, been faintly, very faintly, imitated in the Palais Royal at Paris. Near to the church, the Cam panile, or steeple, three hundred and thirty feet in height, surmounted by an angel in bronze, rears its stupendous head, and stands alone. At the top of this tower was the immortal Galileo, of whom I shall speak more at large hereafter, wont to make his observations on the heavenly bodies. Within a few feet from the Campanile, say thirty or forty, the noble pile of buildings called the Procuratia, together with the public Library, display their glories at right angles. The latter is a building of unmatchable elegance and costliness, adorned with statues, executed by the mighty Sansovino, which, in no other edifice in the world, have I seen equalled in point of merit, and much less so in quantity. Arabesque foliage, heads of lions, men, women, children \u2014 entire statues of heroes, gods, and females ; some with drapery, others inpuris naturalibus \u2014 models of the choic est kind of decoration, disposed with judgment, and bestowed with the magnanimous liberality worthy of a great, and liberal, and wealthy people. Such are the objects, all in marble, and finished with the hand of a master, which grace the Library at Venice."], [199, "163 VENICE. Some critics, springing from the tribe of eco nomists, have been very severe with the square of St. Mark, and have ventured to pronounce the style of the buildings too exuberant ; but, as a poor man once said to a painter, who was complaining that his works were undervalued \u2014 \" it would be a rare performance indeed, if no fault were found with it \" \u2014 the same may be said of this noble Piazza. Fronting the Library, at the distance of about a hundred and fifty feet, one side of the Ducal Palace presents itself, the facade of which overlooks the sea. It is an immense building, originally supported by a crowd of pillars, re sembling a forest of huge trees, entirely com posed of marble. But the ultramontane be holder, accustomed to the sight of bricks in his own country, cannot readily bring himself to credit the simple fact, that the chequered walls of this incomparable building are not of brick, but are actually squares of red and white mar ble : the former of which was brought from Verona, and has a good deal the colour of burnt clay. The court of this palace is extremely fine, especially two of its sides, which are highly deco rated with sculptured marble from top to bottom ; aided by the famous Giant's stairs, which are m2"], [200, "164 VENICE. formed of, and inlaid with, fine stones ; together with a multitude of statues, chiselled by the most eminent workmen, many of them being antiques. By the bye, it appears to me not a little extra ordinary, that, in the present rage for church building in England, scarcely any decorations of the richer kind are to be discovered ; and, of the ornate style, none ; unless a few flourishes of leaves, and flowers, and composi tions drawn from inanimate nature, may be classed under that head. A few meagre basso relievos, it is true, have been added, as well as a sprinkling of statues ; but, generally speaking, these shabby decorations are beneath medio crity, and more especially the detached statues. The above-mentioned splendid edifice has no fewer than five and thirty arches ; namely, seventeen on the side looking towards the Li brary, and eighteen on the side facing the sea, each of them being ten feet wide. The dia meter of the shafts which support this vast pile may be guessed at, from the extent of both sides, which is four hundred and five feet. Both the outer and inner porticos serve for the re creation, as well as shelter of the people. A variety of staircases open into the interior, all of them spacious, and some of them orna-"], [201, "165 VENICE. mented with elaboratepaintings of extraordinary merit, in the manner of galleries \u2014 a style of decoration common in public, as well as private edifices. Indeed, the Italians generally are uncommonly fond of pictures ; and for that reason do I consider them as surpassing the rest of the world, in their admiration of the beauties of nature. And, indeed, are we not all, more or less, painters ? What is the organ of sight but a window for pictures ? And of consequence, a human being is an iconoclist if I may be permitted to use the expression) from his very cradle ; unless he happen to be born blind. Vision, or the faculty of sight, is assuredly the foremost of the senses : and, that the first- rate painters have the best sight, no one will pretend to deny. Let the principle be even applied intellectually, and probably it will bear the most scrupulous examination. \" Where there is no vision, the people perish,\" is the language of Scripture : and sublime language it is, implying, that the loss of sight, materially or spiritually, is tantamount to jeopardy and ruin. What have the Quakers, and other contemners ofthe elegant arts, to say to my position ? Although M 3"], [202, "166 VENICE. I despise no trade, nor find fault with nature for furnishing us with the means of making bread, yet would not I be ranked with those dullards, who cry down painting, and underrate the orna mental dispensations of Heaven. When God, in his wisdom, shall contract his hand, and send forth fruit without blossom, or bestow the blessing of eye-sight for the low purposes of appetite \u2014 when the soul shall become warped and neutralized \u2014 then, but not till then, will certain notions appear less ridiculous, and less objectionable, than they now do. The Quakers, in some respects, resemble the Jews ; in other respects, they differ widely from that people. The Quakers are proudly prim and particular about their garments : the Jews are much given to filth and finery. The Quakers wear habits of the choicest fabric, and the most delicate texture : the Jews, on the contrary, adopt feathers and all sorts of trinkets and taw dry. The sons of Israel are airy and volatile ; while the disciples of George Fox affect a stiff, and blunt, and demure, and rigid deportment. Both Quaker and Jew, however, are studious of accumulating vast wealth. Individually, the Hebrew, in this respect, outstrips the yea-and nay Friend, and all other denominations. A"], [203, "167 VENICE. small number of them mystify and bewilder the rest of the world. But, as a tribe, advancing in a phalanx, the Quakers threaten the whole fabric of society with subjugation \u2014 through the medium of gold. They borrow of no man : neither do they lend readily. On this head, however, I am not positively instructed. At any rate, it is well understood, that they chiefly expend their money amongst those of their own religious profession ; though they will sell freely to strangers. To players, musicians, and profane dancers, they never give a farthing in any shape ; though they will cordially receive the coin of these same players, and musicians, and profane dancers, at their shops. Peradventure they may allege, that though they take the cash, they give wares in return. True : but the profits ! my honest Aminadab \u2014 what be comes of the profits ? It is, therefore, obvious, that, at this rate, as far as actual calculation warrants us in coming to a conclusion, the Quakers, in the course of time, must outstrip all the rest of mankind in point of riches ; and, as long as money bags shall bear the sway, few of us can doubt what sort of Jerusalem those people are looking forward to ! Upon the whole, therefore, the Jews \u2014 who, occasionally, are friends to the fine arts \u2014 are, perhaps, as a m 4"], [204, "168 VENICE. body, less cunning and politic than the Quakers. Now, so far from painting having a tendency to accelerate the subversion of kingdoms, I be lieve the direct contrary to be the fact. Rome at this moment beholds, in that beautiful art, a stay, a prop \u2014 a child imbued with true filial piety, shedding the balm of comfort over the mind, and administering to the wants of that parent of monarchies, in this her decrepitude. Foreigners who repair to Italy, hie constantly to Rome, and protract their stay in that city, that they may become acquainted with the gra phic jewels it contains ; thereby contributing to the support of thousands. With similar views, and with like advantages to the natives, are many other parts of the world visited by travellers. What I have here urged with regard to painting, applies also to sculp ture and architecture ; and shews that they may be considered profitable, even in the eyes ofthe political economist. But, their higher and more noble purpose is, the improvement ofthe mi\u00abd, and the sublimation of the intellect. Stor nothing can be more true, than the observajlqn of an admired writer, that \" a cultivated taste increases sensibility to all the tender and humane passions, by giving them frequent exercise ;"], [205, "VENICE. 169 while it tends to weaken the more violent and fierce emotions\" \u2014 \" Ingenuas didicisse fidelitur artes Emollit mores, nee sinit esseferos. \" These polish'd arts have humaniz'd mankind, Soften'd the rude, and calm'd the boist'rous mind.'

To enumerate the paintings which are to be seen at Venice, nearly all of them super-excel lent, and to point out their respective beauties, would be a task far beyond the design which I at first proposed to myself ; namely, that of merely giving a rapid sketch of what I had beheld, interspersed with such observations and"], [206, "170 VENICE. reflections as were naturally suggested to my mind, by the topics under examination. For the present, I shall advert to the city of Venice itself; which may be said to rest neither on earth, nor water, nor sky, and which seems the work of divine, rather than of human agency. It is impregnable, though unprotected by fortresses. As Martinelli observes, its boun daries and commencement cannot be traced ; neither can its termination be ascertained. Most plentifully supplied, on every side, with whatever is necessary for the use of man, the liberal and mechanical arts were cherished; and commerce was seen flourishing. Men of genius and of talent, in every art and science, were brought forward and rewarded, without pa rade or ostentation. Grandeur, devoid of glarish frivolity, was every where visible. The costume ofthe nobles was sober, yet rich, and calculated to attract respect from their inferiors. The dress of all classes of the people Avas consistent with the simplicity and decency of good sense and of genuine religion. Liberty and tranquillity were every where enjoyed, while prepotency found an instant corrective in wise laws, speedily administered by impartial and upright men, and enforced in behalf of the poor as well as of the rich. Illustrious, too, by the felicity of her un-"], [207, "VENICE. 171 dertakings, and the respect in which the repub lic of Venice was held by every other state, her victories rendered her the admiration of the rest of the world, and respected for her maritime power, as well as her terrestrial dominion \u2014 alike feared by land, and formidable on the ocean. Her government combined profound policy with genuine Christianity, and remained uncon taminated, amidst a profuse waste of treasure and of blood, in wars carried on for the defence of religion. The multiplicity of churches, hos pitals, chapels, and other holy places, which were built and endowed, not only decently, but sumptuously, together with the manifold acts of charity offered up to the Deity, and to the afflicted amongst mankind, justify the claim of Venice to the title of the sanctuary of Re bgion, and the abode of Christian piety and genuine benevolence. This city, as I have already observed, may be said to rest neither on earth, nor water, nor sky. Not on sky ; because, although elevated above the ground her splendid edifices tower aloft, they are nevertheless the abode of mortals. Not on earth ; since, out of this, the Almighty has ordained that there should grow fruits and herbs, and not lofty and stupendous palaces, temples, and noble mansions. And, for the"], [208, "172 VENICE. same reason, perceiving those majestic eleva tions in masonry soaring to the clouds, it cannot be water. Therefore I know not whether this place should be called immoveable water, or unsteady land ; terrestrial sky, or aerial earth. This renowned city may be said to have no foundation ; the substratum being neither rock, nor sand, nor solid earth ; but mere mud, which yields to the pressure of the foot, yet never theless sustains this wondrous pile of buildings ; reminding one of the language of the royal Psalmist, when speaking of the Supreme Archi tect of the Universe, \" quijirmavit terram super aquas,\" with regard to his power in forming the universe. For truly the immortal and eternal Spirit could alone have stirred up mortality to raise a work of this kind, to become, as it were, a city of refuge for the righteous, and a sanc tuary for the followers of the true faith, amidst clouds of barbarism, and a wilderness of the most furious persecutions ! Behold a city, strong without fortifications ! For no walls encircle her ; nor are there towers or battlements for purposes of war. Neither are there gates, or highways, or other fixed passages, for egress and regress. But, both by day and by night, around and throughout, this fa mous city is open and unguarded. Nevertheless,"], [209, "173 VENICE. under Heaven, it possessed not only the means of defence for her own inhabitants, but for the protection of those of the other cities, who re posed under the safeguard of her invincible Lion. Her beginning is unknown ; since there exists no memorial of the arrival of her first citizens. And although historians date her commence ment from the 25th of March, a.d. 421 ; which happened to be the time of laying the founda tion of Saint James of Rialto, her first church (supposing it to be the first), and which, for those days, was of extraordinary magnificence ; \u2014 it is impossible that that should have been the period ; inasmuch as a church is ever pre ceded by other habitations, especially in the midst of swamps and water. In fact, it is known that, previous to the year 400, people resided there ; for then it was that the Gepids and Goths ravaged all Italy, and forced numerous opulent and noble families to repair for safety to the Venetian Lagunes, among the people there settled. In consequence of this emigration, from a state of actual poverty and destitution, the city thenceforward grew and spread with the strides of a giant. Besides the sublime square of St. Mark, there are at Venice hundreds of noble palaces and stately buildings. Indeed, according to Sanso-"], [210, "174 VENICE. vino, in no city of Europe are there so many sumptuous habitations, of equal grandeur in point of architecture, so completely adapted for comfort and convenience. And to this I may add, without exaggeration, that within a circuit of six miles, the boundaries of this me tropolis, the dwellings, as well as the popula tion, are more numerous than in any other city of twice its magnitude. The vast number of wells which furnish the inhabitants, though surrounded by the sea, with an excellent supply of fresh water, de serves notice ; as well as the convenience of proceeding to and fro by boat, and of thereby conveying, by the labour of one man, as many goods as would require ten waggons to forward by land. Canals are seen winding in every direction, dividing the city into seventy-two islands, though never hindering those who prefer walking from going by land, by means of her numerous bridges. In short, when we behold a city of such magnitude, built upon piles in the midst of the sea, so well supplied with every thing that the heart of man can desire, from the necessary up to the luxury of life, we are forced to acknow ledge, that it is scarcely possible that the in genuity of man should be carried farther."], [211, "VENICE. 175 As a nation, the Venetians are perhaps the most polite in the world ; and that from circum stances peculiar to their city : for as there are no carriages nor horses, all ranks and classes of society are compelled to go a good deal on foot, and consequently come much in contact with each other ; so that the morgue aristocratique, which one sees so much of at Paris or London, never annoys the pedestrian. Even the gondolas, or marine palanquins, were so plain, that the people neither felt themselves offended or hu miliated at the sight of them ; for the nobles, in the time of the Republic, were restrained by law from extravagance in their equipages. Venice might formerly be called the city of peace. Every thing in it was quiet and tranquil. The suavity of the Venetian manners resembled the softness of their climate. With singular propriety, the Doge was saluted by the title of \" the most serene prince.\" The arts of peace flourished amongst them with amazing splen dour. The mine was of a richness scarcely conceivable. In the single branch of painting, a vein was discovered, which, in the course of time, found its way into every palace and great mansion throughout Europe. The noble-minded Venetians were sensible that a true painter, instructed by nature to view"], [212, "176 VENICE. things correctly, and to represent them with fidelity, must, by her immutable laws, be in capable of speaking falsehoods, or of resorting to servile flattery. Rather, therefore, than lose the advantages to be derived from the posses sion of their vivid and animated productions, they knew how to smile benignly over any of those rash and impolitic slips, which, in other countries, were wont to draw down upon the artist the indignation and vengeance of those in authority. A striking instance this, of the su perior wisdom of the Venetian legislature ! For who amongst us would expect, that the brilliant Tintoretto, who pervaded the heavens of truth more like a god than a mortal, should be an obsequious sycophant, a fawning spaniel, a toad, tongue-bound, venomous and vile ? I answer \u2014 no one possessing the least portion of discern ment. It is not at all surprising, that so few good paintings are to be met with in countries, the potentates of which are enveloped in clouds of ignorance, and surrounded by swarms of fulsome adulators. It should ever be borne in mind by them, that \" flattery is evanescent, but works remain :\" \u2014 an aphorism, this, which at Venice I once heard levelled at Canova ; whose perfor mances, by the bye, bear few indications of real"], [213, "VENICE. 177 genius ; especially such of them as are of the robust and vigorous kind. Greatly influenced and impressed by the innumerable elegant frag ments of antique art, which were constantly before his eyes, like many others (indeed, so many, that excepting Michael Angelo, and one or two besides, there is not an exception), he has pillaged from them in such an un merciful spirit of plagiarism, such parts of his statues as are not copies are feeble, and gla ringly inferior to the forms which he has bor. rowed from antiques, and regulated by their proportions. Of the truth of my assertion, any one will be convinced, by looking at his Venus and Adonis. The greatest care, there fore, should be taken, lest the fine models at Rome should impair, rather than brace and strengthen and invigorate the capacity of the young artist. The antique absolutely bewilders and stupifies many a tyro ; who, but for the imposing rhapsodies of a set of blustering bul lies in matters of taste, would have been a credit to himself and an honour to his country. Too much allured by the cold marble, they are apt to forsake the carnation of real life, and to fancy nothing strictly correct, that is not hard and marmorean. With all their occasional bad drawing, the Venetians are infinitely superior VOL. I. n"], [214, "178 VENICE. to the vile herd of artists of whom I have been speaking. To revert to what I have said in favour of the Venetians generally. Many a traveller will, I know, contradict me. Let, however, such persons bear in mind, that I have rather been speaking of what they once were, than of what they are now lowered down to, by a long course of misrule. Although I do not profess to be long to the race of ferrets, nor to descend too far into the cespools of infamy, I trust I shall never be backward in distinguishing vice from virtue. That some of the Venetians are noto rious cheats, few will deny; for, in all countries, there are rogues without number. In England, strangers are not more especially singled out for sacrifice than the natives ; whereas, the. lower classes of Italians, and the Venetians in par ticular, exult whenever a trick succeeds against an Englishman, or indeed any foresti&e. But, in what estimation, I ask, are foreigners held by the shopkeepers of England ? Is it not a constant practice with them to depreciate and run down every thing of foreign manufacture ; even when, in then hearts, they know the sneer to be unmerited ? Now, if this be not fraud of the foulest stamp, then am I ignorant what fraud means."], [215, "179 V E N I C E. Not that I would insinuate any thing dero gatory to the renown of my countrymen \u2014 a renown, however, which I fear they have de rived more from their golden, than their mental talents. Invention, genius, sublime flights \u2014 these are gems which are rarely to be found in English soil. Warped and circumscribed as her children are in matters appertaining to bril liant imagination, their several manufactures are ably wrought, neatly polished, and skilfully finished. On the other hand, the Venetians, though capable of erecting the most gorgeous edifices, will leave the very window-frames in so incomplete a state, that they will not ward off the weather. The truth is, that scarcely any articles but those of right down domestic utility are called for in England, whose people are a kind of Quakers or Methodists, with regard to the blandishments of existence ; while the more southern inhabitants of Europe, like the ritual they profess, delight in splendour and pageantry. Perhaps I shall be excused for observing in this place, by way of illustration, that the British legitimate character, in the sphere of intel ligence, bears along with it few portions of excursive imagery. It is neither copious in the lineaments of invention and originality, nor prolific in the charms of novelty. Milton, who n 2"], [216, "180 VENICE. was educated in Italy, and Shakespeare, with all his merit, borrowed freely from the Italians, both with regard to the subject, the thought, and the expression ; as well as most copiously from the Holy Scriptures. If Dante, Ariosto, and the Novellieri were carefully examined, to gether with the Bible, much of what those two English poets have written would not be found so very original, as many have hitherto ima gined them to be. Not that I would insinuate that Shakespeare, for energy of language, for depth of thought, and for aptness of similitude, is not, par excellence, the greatest of poets : but, as a reformer of morals and a queller of the tu multuous passions, little, I think, can be said in his praise. Revenge and murder, and war and havock, are demons by far too familiar with him. In didactic poetry, and in the science of moral philosophy, the English appear to me to have left the rest of the world far behind. For close metaphysical reasoning ; for geometry ; for calculations in matters of finance ; and for a knowledge of the arid sciences, of every de scription, connected with political economy, they bear away the palm. The very shopmen in England display instances of cool sagacity, which, though bottomed on sheer craft, are nevertheless admirable, and fully equal to the"], [217, "181 VENICE. asluzia of a member of the French corps diplo matique. But, what do I infer from all this ? It is the deed itself, and not the individual who performs it, that we ought to look at ; if we wish to arrive at an impartial judgment, and to imitate the final justice of heaven. Habits are not con clusive ; though they certainly contribute much towards the formation of character. For instance, all merchants are not uniformly narrow-minded. Much of the staid sort of temper above spoken of is the offspring of certain pursuits. Com mercial and other men, travelling from any country to distant lands, bring back with them the secrets practised in business abroad, and those finesses and inventions cease, in the course of time, to be exotics ; until, at length, aug mented by constant accessions, excited by fresh luxuries, and stimulated by the furies of am bition, the more gentle elements of taste and elegant mental images take their departure ; unable to domiciliate with the coarse passions which a spirit for traffic engenders, and which spirit is invariably inimical to the effusions of true genius \u2014 that description of genius, I mean, which imparts the light of truth, as the showers of heaven mature the fruits of the earth. n 3"], [218, "182 VENICE. As tempests are accompanied by rains, which may be beneficial to the fields, so, amidst the storms of the soul, are occasional flashes of the divine spirit elicited. But, such flashes are neither safe nor desirable ; since, the collision of particular bodies may produce fatal con sequences, if the emitted sparks should ac cidentally be carried amidst inflammable sub stances. From all which, it is to be inferred, that the happiest condition is the condition of peace \u2014 O beauteous Peace ! Sweet union of a state ! what else but thou Gives safety, strength, and glory to a people 'i\" CHAPTER XIX. VENICE- A rapid Sketch ofthe Causes which led to the Overthrow ofthe Venetian Republic Under the fatal Influence qf Francesco Pesaro, the Republic, in evil hour, declare for an Unarmed Neutrality. At the commencement of the French revolu tion, the Marquess Antonio Govion Broglio Solari, a Venetian nobleman, having made the"], [219, "VENICE. 183 tour of Switzerland, with the Danish ambas sador, Baron d'Eirben, returned by the way of Turin, for the purpose of claiming a consider able landed estate, belonging to the family of Solari ; who, at the time of the plague in Piedmont, had dispersed themselves in various parts of Italy and France. The above branch settled at Venice, a second at Loretto, and a third, which took the name of Broglio, in France : and all of them are still living. Before the above-mentioned claim could be established, it was necessary that the Marquess should be presented to the King ; without which, a sight of the public documents could not be obtained. The Marquess de Prie, and the Count Perrone were his securities. The King, regarding the family of Solari as aliens, and that of the Bevillacquas, who were in pos- session of the property, as his subjects, thought proper, for reasons of policy, to refuse the desired permission. But, to soften the disap- pointment, his Majesty offered to decorate the Marquess Solari with the order of the Cross of San Maurizio Lazzaro ; which the Marquess, in his turn, thought fit to refuse, unless his Ma jesty would accompany it with a commende ; as he was by no means ambitious, he said, of an empty title. n 4"], [220, "184 VENICE. i Such are the distressing situations in which individuals are liable to be placed, who live under absolute and despotic princes, capriciously decid ing on the property and lives of their subjects, in despite of law, and justice, and equity ! On leaving the court, the Marquess Solari dined in company with the two noblemen above mentioned, who then filled the situations of Minister of State and Prime Minister, at the court of Turin. In the course of conversation, the Marquess de Prie said, \" My dear Solari, you are about to set off for Venice. If you are no longer a Piedmontese, you are, at any rate, an Italian. Bear in mind what. I am about to say to you. Inform the government, of which you are a member, that if we do not agree to enter into an Italian League, we shall all be buried in the common ruin of our country, from the meditated invasion of these modern Goths and Vandals ; for they are actually an army of Attilas. The Venetian Republic is the best populated, the richest, and the most beloved government in all Italy. Sixty thousand men would be more easily raised by it, than forty thousand would be in Piedmont.\" \" Yes,\" continued the Marquess Perrone, \" on the wisdom of the Venetian Senate, and on its future measures, I assert, and am ready"], [221, "185 VENICE. to maintain, that all Italy will be indebted either for its salvation or overthrow. Remember, my dear Solari, I am an old practitioner in the policy of states !\" After having completed a mission, with which he had been charged from his own government to that of Milan, Solari returned to Venice, and faithfully reported what had passed be tween him and the ministers of the court of Turin. Indeed, dispatches to the same effect had preceded him, in which a reference was made to the verbal communication. He was accordingly called upon officially ; and being sincerely attached to his country, he expressed his honest sentiments, with all that ardour and animation which became a free-born subject. Whereupon, Antonio Zen, one of the Consiglio di Died said, smilingly, \" My dear Solari, I admire and appreciate the warmth of your patriotism ; but you must excuse me for saying, that you are viewing objects from the wrong end of the microscope.\" Zaccaria Valleroso, one of the Inquisitori di Stato, being one evening in company, at Venice, with a lady who had been an attachee to the court of France, at the breaking out of the revolution, and had escaped from its horrors, and of whom Madame Campan has spoken in"], [222, "186 VENICE. her Memoirs, though she has not named her\u2014 the lady happened to say, that she thought of retiring to the north of Europe. \" Why, Ma dame,\" said Valleroso, \" surely you are not afraid of the French army coining to Venice ?\" \" I beg your pardon, sir,\" replied the lady ; \" I think I am sufficiently well acquainted with the French to venture to assert, that if the Venetians do not prevent them from passing the Alps, the territory of the Republic will be no more respected than any other part of Italy ; the whole of which will be overrun, when once they have entered Savoy.\" \" Ah ! Madame,\" said Valleroso, \" these are sentiments unbecoming the mouth of a young female. The wisdom of the policy which we have uniformly adopted, will ever preserve us from the suspicion of partiality, by either of the contending parties.\" \" Have you a couple of hundred thousand men,\" rejoined the lady, \" ready to back your neutrality? If you have not, I cannot help fearing \u2014 forgive my womanish alarms \u2014 that your condition will be similar to that of those individuals, who are placed ' between two stools.' \" The Grand Inquisitor, who seemed to think my suspicions unbottomed, and that I was fun-"], [223, "VENICE. 187 damentally in error, smiled ; and, shaking his head, sententiously replied, \" Deem me not guilty of a breach of politeness when I tell you, Madam, that prophecy and prognostication are now-a-days out of vogue.\" The lady, however, \u2014 whom my readers will, by this time, surmise to have been their humble servant \u2014 instead of making herintended journey to the north, continued to reside in the south ; and having married a Venetian gentleman, she had frequent opportunities of being in the society of this unbelieving Jew of an Inquisitor ; but, never did she venture to touch upon the subject of her prophecy, until the French had actually taken possession of Venice ; when, in the pre sence of several persons of distinction, who had been witnesses to the former conversation, she said, \" Well, Cavalier Valleroso, will you now tell me, that my prophecies and prognostica tions were unbecoming the mouth of a young female ?\" Valleroso was so much affected, that he could give no answer ; and ever after he quitted the company, when chance happened to bring them together. Justice, however, demands that I should give my readers a trait in the character of this man, which does honour to his memory. Having been applied to, both by the French"], [224, "188 VENICE. and the Austrians, to accept a situation under their respective Governments, he unhesitatingly refused. His answer was \u2014 \"No; for nearly the whole of my life I have been a sovereign. I will not end my days in servitude.\" Though by no means rich, he was almost the only patrician of Venice, who conducted himself thus nobly and independently. The above-mentioned despatch from Turin, together with the accounts from France, the meeting ofthe ministers at Pilnitz, and the Duke of Brunswick's manifesto, induced at last the Venetian Republic to come to a definitive decision ; when, after many very long debates, it was determined, through the powerful in fluence of Francesco Pesaro, well known to have been the partizan of Austria, that the Republic should declare for an unarmed neu trality \u2014 a word unknown in the political vocabu lary, and only fitted to proceed from the mouth of the feeble-minded creature by whom it was uttered. The Venetian Senate, which, from its wise regulations, had never had occasion, since the formidable conspiracy ofthe Marquess de Bed mar, in the year 1618, even to suspect internal commotion, were now so overawed by the nu merous false reports spread by interested emis-"], [225, "189 VENICE. saries, that they no longer considered them selves safe in holding their public deliberations in the Ducal Palace, and therefore changed their place of meeting every evening, from one private palace to another. The night before they abdicated the Government, that wretched imbecile, the Doge, Manin, was heard to say, at the conversazione of the Senator Damula, \" I am sorry for those poor creatures who will be deprived of their bread by this misfortune ; but as for us, we shall all be as well off as ever !\" O ! had there been but a Dandolo, a Foscari, a Tron, or any other man of spirit among the Senators, the white livered cowardly Doge would have lost his head for his pusillanimity \u2014 the seat of government would have been changed as it formerly had been, to one of the Grecian Islands, and the Government would never have consented to have made so miserable, so dis graceful an exit ! To give my readers a correct notion of the extent ofthe treachery and corruption that pre vailed, and of the degeneracy of some of the leading members of the Senate, I will here introduce some striking facts. The Cavalier Condolmier, the High Admiral, who had the command of a fleet of observa-"], [226, "190 VENICE. tion, consisting of small vessels, to protect the entrance of the Lagunes, and who had, for some months, been detained at the mouth of the Adriatic, one day took it into his head to invite the Government and the public, to be present at a grand naval man\u0153uvre of all the ships in the harbour under his command. The day at length arrived; when Venice, and the whole Terra Firma, would have proved a rich field for the active exertions of our nimble fingered gen try of London ; since nearly all the inhabitants had quitted their houses, in order to be present at the wonderful exploits of this Nelson of the Venetian Lagunes. The roads from Treviso, Padua, and along the banks ofthe Brenta, were thronged with travellers, on foot and on horse back, in carriages and in carts. The lakes were covered with gondolas, peotti, open boats, burchielli, barges from Padua, gallere, &c. &c. &c. When the Rear Admiral shewed himself in his full uniform, scraping and bowing to the anxious spectators, as a mountebank does while selling his vile nostrums, he commenced the farce, by ordering the signals to be given. This was accordingly done ; but every one of them remained unanswered. Up and down ran boys and men, from one mast and shrowd to another ;"], [227, "191 VENICE. but all to no purpose. An apology was made, and the ill success was attributed to want of practice. The Admiral then made signals to another vessel, but with the like success. After firing and making tokens for more than an hour, like men shooting at dead fish, and after ex hausting speaking trumpets, tearing sails, and casting anchors ; after having, in short, failed both to right and left, the poor Admiral was assailed in front, by all those who were disap pointed. Night, however, coming to his assis tance, the charlatan contrived to make his escape, in a whole skin : and thus ended this me morable day, as it had commenced \u2014 in smoke ! Such were the valorous saviours of their country, who remained to protect the Lagunes, and to hail all persons who passed their vessels, whether coming to, or going from Venice ! When the fatal day at length arrived, and the revolution had actually taken place, most ofthe respectable inhabitants fled to the Terra Firma, from the plunder and confusion that were its inevitable consequences ; but which, to say the truth, was nothing, in comparison with what it might have been, and what it actually had been, in every other place, on similar distressing occasions."], [228, "192 VENICE. The sailors in these guard ships were from Dalmatia, commonly called Sclavonians, and active votaries to the nimble-fingered Mercury. Fortunate was it for Venice, that these fellows were, at the time, absent from the city. A gondola that happened to be passing, was boarded by them, and asked, \" What was going on at Venice ?\" \" Oh, horrible !\" answered some of the passengers ; \" they are robbing and plundering the houses in all directions.\" \" Jesu Maria, have mercy upon us !\" exclaimed these honest Sclavonian tars, \" let us go in stantly, and get a watch or two a-piece, and a little plate and linen, to take home to our dear wives and children !\""], [229, "193 CHAPTER XX. \u25a0* VENICE.

As a proof that the Venetian Republic had no intention whatever of taking any part against the French, it will be only necessary for me to state, that Lavizzari, when he was Venetian resi dent at the Court of Great Britain, sent to his government a proposition made by the British cabinet, offering a certain number of ships to protect the Venetian territories in the Adriatic, besides a considerable sum of money, wherewith to raise an additional number of auxiliaries, if necessary. This proffer the Republic thought fit to decline. The proposition was first made in the year 1793. It was afterwards twice re- vol. i. o"], [230, "194 VENICE. peated, and as often rejected; accompanied, however, with expressions of their liveliest grati tude for the interest which the British ministry had taken in the welfare and safety of the Republic. A copy of one of the documents containing this refusal, fell into the hands of the French Government ; by what means has not been ascer tained. It is, however, supposed to have had some influence on the conduct of Buonaparte towards the Republic ; from the certainty it afforded him, that he had nothing to fear from England, in consequence of any aggression he might think proper to commit. The said copy of the rejected proposition was shewn to the Venetian minister in Switzerland, in conse quence, as is supposed, of Pesaro's project of an unarmed neutrality. General Acton was then the minister of Naples. On the despatches to the British am bassador, Sir William Hamilton, containing the refusal of the Venetian Republic, being shown to him, though the general did not wish the King of Naples to take any share in the English system of naval armament about to be established in the Mediterranean, he nevertheless thought it highly necessary, that an Italian league should be entered into ; and, so sensibly was he affected"], [231, "195 VENICE. by the perusal of the above despatch, contain ing the determination of the Venetian senate, that he wrote an energetic memorial to the Republic, dissuading them from persisting in the fatal notion of remaining neutral ; and, above all things, of remaining unarmed. Nor would he even trust his despatch to Bus cinello, the Venetian ambassador, but sent a Neapolitan nobleman expressly to Venice, * with a proposition for maintaining a line of guard ships, to be united with the Venetian, from Capo Passero to Corfu. The Grand Master of Malta also undertook to guard the line, from that island up to the Levant ; while Pope Pius the Sixth offered to assist the Venetians, by sea and land, with all the Italian powers ; and remon strated, in the strongest terms, against the im politic adoption, on their part, of an unarmed neutrality. But, all was of no avail. The Go vernment of Venice had taken its measures ; and was resolved not to swerve therefrom. With what face then, could Buonaparte accuse that Republic of treachery, in arming against the French, and adduce that treachery as a formal reason for violating the Venetian neutrality ; for inducing Bergamo and Brescia to revolt ; and for directing the horrible massacre o 2"], [232, "196 V E N I C E. at Verona, and effecting the overthrow of its Government? But all these existing documents are nothing, when compared to the mass of proofs which could be adduced, exonerating the Venetian Republic from every foul charge made against it, by the then commander of the army of Italy. Nay, Barras himself could have confuted the whole of Buonaparte's base accusations ; and the other four members of the Directory had very weighty reasons \u2014 reasons as big as a plum \u2014 for guaranteeing the independence of the Venetian States. No : they are indebted for all their distresses to the primitive sin of not keep ing up an army by sea and by land, which might act in conjunction with those of the above-mentioned powers, and thereby cause their neutrality to be respected. From all which, I think it is abundantly evident, that the ruin of Italy may with justice be attributed to that weak, as well as wicked senator, Francesco Pesaro ; whose influence, and whose notorious partiality for the Austrians, induced the Venetian Republic to depart from its antient system of an armed neutrality ; whereby, on all former occasions, it had caused itself to be respected. But, influenced by cor-"], [233, "197 VENICE. ruption\u2014 by ambition \u2014 by folly \u2014 and by per sonal interest, he compelled the senate to adopt a neutrality unarmed, and had the baseness to stigmatize all those who opposed him, as traitors and jacobins. Francesco Labbia was likewise in the interest of Austria. On the first reverses, however, of the Imperial army, whilst he was Podesta of Padua, he opened the gates of that city to the French. He was nevertheless rewarded with a German wife, and was favourably received at Vienna \u2014 in recompense for betraying the go vernment of his native country ! As soon as Venice had been sold by Buona parte to the Austrians, Francis Pesaro was dis patched by the latter government from Vienna, whither he had fled, to place the foreign yoke on the necks of his fellow- citizens ; those citi zens who, during the space of fourteen centu ries, had governed themselves, without suffering the humiliation of any foreign interference. The first act of Pesaro's authority, after his return to Venice, was the banishment of his only brother, Pietro Pesaro ; who, at this mo ment, resides, and has been residing ever since, in the outskirts of London, in a small mansion, not so large as one of the out-houses of his o 3"], [234, "198 VENICE. magnificent marble palace, on the grand canal at Venice.\" Francis Pesaro, and a few of his followers, equally ignorant as himself, and who had always been considered to be so by the major part of the senators, and especially by the great pater patri\u0153, Francesco Foscari, who generally made Pesaro the laughing-stock of the senate, when ever he attempted to open his mouth \u2014 being left, by their deaths, masters ofthe field of action, opposed the Republic in every thing that tended to its welfare ; but most especially in that one thing, so essential to its own dignity as an independent state, and to the salvation of all Italy \u2014 an armed neutrality. Having introduced the celebrated Frances Foscari to the notice of my reader, I shall, I am confident, be excused a short digression. It is unnecessary for me to inform him, that the winged lion of St. Mark was the antient arms ofthe Republic ; that saint having become the patron of Venice, ever since his remains were brought to that city from the Levant. Even the animal itself is so represented ; holding be tween his claws the book of the laws of that evangelical saint, and distinguished from his brother lions by having a crown on his head,"], [235, "199 VENICE. and wings rising out of his shoulders ; which insignia were at the head of all the decrees and acts of the Republic. This circumstance gave rise to the witty reply of Foscari to Prince Kaunitz, the Austrian minister, on his asking one day, in the presence of the Empress Maria Theresa, at whose court Foscari then resided as the Venetian ambassador, \" where the Republic had found its winged lion ?\" \" In the same forest,\" replied Foscari, \" in which Austria dis covered her two-headed eagle.\" The beautiful Maria Theresa laughed heartily, not only at Foscari's answer, but at the effect it produced on Prince Kaunitz ; who, suddenly starting back, nearly knocked off his superb court wig, which it usually took him a couple of hours every morning to adjust to his satis faction. The answer given to the Austrian minister by the shrewd Venetian, recals to my recollec tion a singular trait in the character of Prince Kaunitz, shewing the uncommon attention which he paid to his dress, and especially to his peruke and his teeth ; the latter of which he would wash after dinner at table, in the presence of his guests. This eminent diplomatist, who had been the confidential minister of five suc cessive monarchs, had, hke all other great men, o 4"], [236, "200 VENICE. his foibles ; thereby proving themselves to be mere mortals. For, throughout every scene of life, virtue and wisdom and talent will be found opposed by vice and folly and presumption ; generosity and magnanimity by sordid avarice ; and sublimity of soul in theory, by deeds of littleness in practice. I venture the reflection after long personal experience. This same Prince Kaunitz was the most dis tinguished German dandy ofhis day, and was, as I have said, especially particular in the ar rangement, of his wig. I had one morning an appointment with him on some business for a friend ; when his secretary told me he was sure the Prince had forgot the hour he had appointed, as it was the precise time which he devoted to his toilet, and that I should have to wait at least a couple of hours. While I was so waiting, this secretary related to me the following par ticulars. It was the usual practice, he said, for the valet-de-chambre to dress the said wig on the Prince's head. As soon as the row upon row of curls had been diplomatically and skilfully arranged, the knight of the curling irons next emptied at least a pound of powder into his pouch, and, from an aperture in the door, made for the purpose, puffed it into an empty room."], [237, "VENICE. 201 When the room was completely filled therewith, the Prince, with a mask on his face, entered it, and took a few stately turns backward and for ward, until every hair of his perfumed perriwig had received its due quantum of the powdery particles. Foscari, perceiving that Maria Theresa en joyed the above retort, took the liberty of telling her Imperial Majesty, that she might smile, but it was no laughing matter to himself, who, on his return to Venice, after a three years' resi dence at her court, could not boast of having so much as once had the pleasure of beholding her Imperial Majesty's countenance. Maria Theresa, imagining that the Venetian ambassador had attempted to say something very witty, desired him to explain himself. Upon which, Foscari replied, \" May it please your Majesty, I am unfortunately so near sighted, that without my magnifying-glass, I am unable to distinguish the features of any indi vidual I am in conversation with ; but I dare not, of course, venture to make use of it in your Imperial Majesty's presence.\" \" Yes, yes ! Foscari ;\" said the Empress, \" pray make use of your glass as much as you please; only take care that you do not"], [238, "202 VENICE. magnify my defects !\" Foscari accordingly availed himself of the royal permission, exclaim ing while doing so, \" Bella ! beila ! si, per Dio!'' and continuing to look at her Imperial Majesty, until he quitted the court. The great Francis Foscari was also ambassa dor at Constantinople, at the period when the famous Count de Vergennes was resident in the same capacity. Both of them being men of liberal minds, the Count, discovering the won derful sagacity and superior talents ofFoscari, soon became his most intimate friend, as well as his disciple in politics. During Foscari's life time, no affair of importance took place in France, after the Count became minister, on which he was not consulted. Happy, most happy, would it have been for France, if her able minister had been at liberty to profit by that great man's counsel ! It was from Foscari, that the Count de Vergennes obtained the famous cypher, by means of which he carried on that impenetrable correspondence, which baffled all the courts of Europe, and even his own most confidential secretaries ; who wrote the letters, and received the answers, in this famous cypher, but nevertheless were unable to guess at a tittle of their contents. This"], [239, "203 VENICE. cypher afterwards proved of the greatest service to many persons of the highest rank, connected with the French court. And here I cannot but expres my astonish ment, that Madame Campan, who has been so minute in her details of the dreadful sufferings to which the royal family were subjected, should never once have made mention ofthe infamous system of espionage which was resorted to, and the treachery wliich was used, with regard to the royal correspondence on the most trifling subjects, by the very persons who were in the service ofthe court. Perhaps those individuals were still living at the time of her writing her Memoirs ; and that therefore she was unwilling to subject herself to the vengeance, which an exposure of their baseness might have brought down upon her. Be this as it may, I well know that the Count de Vergennes, during his administration, made use of this cypher, in all matters of importance; and that the whole of his correspondence with Foscari was carried on through the same medium. I know not at what period of the troubles in France \u2014 whether at the time of the famous necklace affair, or after the horrors com mitted at Versailles on the sixth of October, or at a later period of the revolution \u2014 it was put"], [240, "204 VENICE. into the hands of a person who communicated it to the Queen ; but I do know that she was thereby enabled to avoid discoveries in the course of her extensive correspondence. As I was frequently employed in the confidential transactions of the ever-to-be-regretted Marie Antoinette, I often assisted in copying the said despatches, in the presence of the good Madame Campan. It, of course, became necessary that I should have the cypher, to instruct the per sons to whom the letters were addressed, and of which I was generally the bearer, how to arrive at their contents. As the key to it was changed every time, and could be altered at pleasure, it might be ren dered of the greatest utility ; as it was morally impossible for a third person to discover what was passing, though in possession of the cypher and the despatches, without being previously made acquainted with the key fixed on between the writer and the person to whom the letter was addressed. It has ever since remained in my possession. Still further to lengthen this digression. On the day that the King and royal family of France were desirous of going to St. Cloud, at the time when the people were averse to their leaving the Tuilleries, M. de La Fayette, who"], [241, "205 VENICE. commanded the national troops then on guard at the palace, entered the king's closet, for the purpose of knowing his majesty's pleasure. \" From what I have observed from my window,\" said the king, \" I fear our intended journey cannot be carried into effect without bloodshed ; and, that being the case, I shall endeavour to persuade the Queen not to attempt it.\" La Fayette made his bow and retired. On going out of the palace, he met General Bournonville (from whom I had the anecdote), and said to him, \" the king's irresolute conduct this day, will very probably cost me my head, and his majesty his crown. Luckily I have not committed myself, by ordering the troops to make any resistance ; for I am sure I should have been sacrificed, from the king's want of firmness. I wish he may not have cause to repent his excessive condescension to the will of the populace.\" As I have already introduced the name of the great Maria Theresa, the mother of the beautiful Marie Antoinette, I shall wind up this chapter of digressions with a few anecdotes relative to her Imperial Majesty, which were communicated to me, when I visited Vienna, in the year 1794, by the Prince de Ligne."], [242, "206 VENICE. Maria Theresa was considered the hand somest woman of her day. She was the last of the race of the Counts of Hapsburgh, and, history says, of the noble race of Swiss Car bonari, since known by the name and title of the House of Austria. She was married, in the year 1736, to Francis Duke of Lorraine and Bar, generally known by the title of Francis, the first Emperor of Ger many ; by whom the Empress Queen had many children, and to nine of whom I have had the honour of being presented : namely, Joseph the Second; Leopold the Second, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and afterwards Emperor; Maximilian, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Coadju tor of Cologne and Munster, and Elector of Cologne ; Ferdinand, who was Archduke of Milan ; Caroline, Queen of Sicily ; Marie An toinette, Queen of France ; Maria Amelia, Archduchess of Parma ; Christina, Arch duchess ofthe Low Countries ; Marianna, Arch abbess of Prague and Clagenfurth ; and Eliza beth, Duchess of Inspruck ; all of whose hands, excepting those of Joseph the Second, I have had the honour of kissing. The Emperor Francis was considered as handsome a man, as Maria Theresa was a"], [243, "VENICE. 207 woman. He was crowned Emperor by the name of Francis the First, jointly with his consort; she being the heiress to the crown. By his affability of deportment, his condescen sion, and his polished manners, he completely won the heart of his beautiful, but haughty empress. Being, however, naturally of a jealous dis position, Maria Theresa soon fancied that she had discovered a growing attachment, on the part of her husband, to one of the beauties of her court, a maid of the royal bed-chamber. Her majesty taxed this innocent female with the suspected crime, in so abrupt a manner, that the lady could not conceal her indignation, and was in the act of quitting the royal pre sence, without deigning to answer the charge. This conduct enraged the great Maria Theresa to such a degree, as to induce her to vent her passion on her supposed rival, by presenting her with an imperial box of the ear. It happened to be levee day. The ante chamber was at this time crowded with com pany, and the celebrated Prince de Ligne was entering the presence chamber, at the very moment when her Majesty had been lavishing her favours with so bountiful a hand. Knowing that his tongue resembled a cathedral bell on"], [244, "208 VENICE. the death ofa sovereign, and that if the prince left her presence without some explanation, the circumstance would soon be made public to all the inhabitants of Vienna, Maria Theresa, turn ing round to him, with the greatest composure and affability, said \u2014 \" My dear Prince, it is some time since I promised you the order of Maria Theresa, together with my own picture.\" Taking then from her scrutoire an elegant snuff-box, in which was the said order, and on its lid her majesty's portrait, set in diamonds, she presented the Prince with the same, and interrogated him as to what he thought of the likeness. \" Madam,\" replied he, \" the proof you have just now given\" (alluding to the box on the ear) \" is a copy of nature itself.\" On the Prince's returning to the drawing room, where the circumstance had got wind, he was surrounded by a crowd of courtiers, who had heard the quarrel, and were all anxious for his explanation of the cause of it. Observing this, the Prince showed the box and the portrait to a lady who was standing near him, saying at the same time, in a tone sufficiently loud to be heard by her Majesty \u2014 \" the present makes me forget the past !\" Maria Theresa was so jealous of her husband, that on his going one evening to the Free"], [245, "V E N 1 C E. 209 Mason's club without first acquainting her with his intention, she had the Lodge surrounded by guards ; and, on the officer who commanded them demanding, in her Majesty's name, the immediate dispersion of the meeting, Francis, presenting himself, said, \" Return to the Em press, your mistress, and inform her that, wher ever her husband is one of the number, she may rest assured that nothing of a treasonable nature will ever be plotted against her, or against the state.\" CHAPTER XXI.

I. p"], [246, "210 VENICE. required that Venice should continue an inde pendent state ; as it had been during the many wars in the south of Europe, between the con tending powers of France, Spain, and Austria. The armies of either of those powers, on enter ing the Venetian territories, were immediately met by an armed force, and conducted by it to the frontiers. But then the Republic had in constant activity from thirty to forty thousand troops \u2014 a number which was more than suf ficient to keep either party in awe ; besides four and-twenty ships of war, ready to be launched, in case of an aggression on the part of any one ofthe said powers. The wisdom of such a step on the part of the Government was obvious, since it effectually protected its subjects from molestation. The advantages resulting from such a line of con duct may be guessed at from the fact, that the Republic never once compromised its neutrality with any of the belligerent powers, but always maintained a rigid impartiality, and thereby caused itself to be alike respected and feared. From the year 1780 to the year 1793 or 1794, the Republic was the richest, the most flourish ing, and the most popular power in all Italy. It had not been engaged in war, whether in ternal or external, for many, many years. The"], [247, "VENICE. 211 population, throughout the whole Venetian territory, was exasperated beyond measure against the sanguinary Masnadieri, who had butchered the King and Queen of France. All that they wanted was a leader ; and, if an able one had stepped forward, the horde that was then spreading devastation and ruin over all Italy would have been exterminated root and branch. Nothing was wanted but the countenance and encouragement of the govern ment ; and, in vindication of that government from the foul charges which have been brought against it, I am bound to declare, that their folly in rejecting the wise proposition for keep ing up an armed force, ready to check the violence of the French invader, was the chief cause of their ruin, and of his aggrandizement. It was Pesaro \u2014 the base, the imbecile, the treacherons Pesaro \u2014 who bullied the Senate into a departure from their former system of an armed neutrality. The spirit of vigorous re sistance which actuated the Dandolos, the Zens, the Trons, the Barbarigos, and that pater patri\u00e6 Francesco Foscari, had long since fled, and those great men buried in the general ruin. The consideration is a truly awful one. The bare idea of seeing from ten to fifteen thousand individuals, of all descriptions, on one p2"], [248, "212 VENICE. day in a state of comfort and even of afflu ence, and on the next thrown upon the very pave, is enough to rouse the most sluggish of mortals into activity, \" be his brains as barren as the banks of Libya.\" And such must ever be the case, during the interregnum between the downfall of one government and the organiza tion of a new one. When Francesco Pesaro first came to Venice, as the Austrian Commissary-General, furnished with full powers to inflict on his countrymen that persecution, imprisonment, and banish ment, which he himself so richly merited at their hands, for having first betrayed and then deserted the government, a grand fete was given at the Filarmonica to this modern Sylla, at which Madame Grassini was engaged to sing. When I entered the saloon, the concert had already commenced ; and a gentleman, one of the chers amis of the above singer, whose name was Giuseppe Ferro, a corn-factor, obli gingly gave up his own seat for my accom modation. Of course, I entered into that kind of conversation with him which his civility demanded. On the other side of the saloon was seated the great Francesco Pesaro. As soon as the first act of the concert was over, my husband, being"], [249, "213 V E N I C E. an old acquaintance of the mighty man, went across the room to congratulate him on his return to his country ; and, pointing to the spot where I was sitting, he said, \" Yonder is my better half; but she is so near-sighted, that I am sure she cannot distinguish your Excellency at this distance.\" \u2014 \" What,\" replied Pesaro, \" the lady who is conversing with the gentle man by the side of her ? I must go and have a little chat with her.\" Accordingly, Pesaro crossed the saloon, and very politely seated him self by me, and asked who the person was who had so much engaged my attention, as to pre vent me from recognizing him. Unluckily for the poor man, I replied, \" It is M. Ferro, to whose politeness I am indebted for my seat.\" \u2014 \" What !\" exclaimed Pesaro, \" that birbone, who was a member of the municipality ?\" \u2014 \" The same,\" said I ; \" and who, at the time of the downfall of the government, deserved so much from his country, by preventing the city from falling a prey to the plunder of the Schiavoni.\" On that very night, poor Ferro was arrested by the agents of Pesaro ; dragged from his rela tives, who entirely depended on him for their subsistence, without any accusation being ad duced against him, without being heard in his p 3"], [250, "214 VENICE. defence, or allowed to communicate with any one of his family, or receive the smallest assis tance ; and sent off as a galley slave, to work on the Danube at Olmutz ; where he remained until the French retook the Venetian territories, when, with many others, he was released from captivity, and restored to his numerous friends and distressed relations. It was currently reported, that Pesaro had a list of nearly three hundred individuals, who were to have shared the fate of poor Ferro ; if Providence, in its mercy, had not ordered it otherwise, by shortly afterwards calling the unfeeling and unprincipled man before that awful tribunal, against whose decision there is no appeal. The wretched man was seized with excessive delirium, brought on by turning a private difference into public revenge, and expired after an illness of a few days. His death gave life and liberty to some of the most distinguished of his fellow-citizens He might truly be considered as the malignant genius of the Venetians, in the same way as the hunch backed Visconti was of the Milanese. What I have further to say respecting Venice will principally consist of miscellaneous anec dotes, collected during my long residence in this interesting city, calculated to make my"], [251, "215 VENICE. readers still further acquainted with the man ners and the customs of its inhabitants under their happy Republic. I have already mentioned the Ducal Palace. In the hall of the Pregadi, which was furnished with benches having bracks to them, the Senate formerly assembled. When any of those warm debates took place of which I have elsewhere spoken, it was customary for the barcajuoli, or boatmen belonging to the patricians, to assemble with their gondolas on the canal, close to that side of the palace which overlooked the port ; considering themselves the second body in the state, and the native defenders of the first. If, during the time that the senators were shut up in close deliberation, which in the winter often continued till late in the night, any disturbance happened to take place, they would shew their vigilance, by watching the motions of the people around them with circumspec tion, and without betraying the slightest impa tience or inquietude, or vaunting themselves on being engaged in the service of i prhicipi, as they were accustomed to denominate their masters. Ministering to the inclinations of the nobles, and being the confidants of their pleasures, as well as a sort of mouchards of the government, v 4"], [252, "216 VENICE. each of them fancied himself in the secrets of the state. They would nevertheless treat those of their own calling, who were not so fortunate as to be in the service of the nobles, on a foot ing of equality, considering them as brothers ; which, indeed, is the word they make use of whenever they meet. \" Addio caro Jradel,'\" \" perme j'radel,\" Sec, are the customary saluta tions on passing and repassing in their gondolas, calling to one another, \" non travagliar, non strascinar, i poveri cristiani.\" When this conduct is contrasted with the language of vulgar abuse made use of by the hackney-coachmen and watermen of London and Paris, the Venetian Gondolieri actually appear to be saints. This striking difference is mainly to be at-. tributed to their detestation of the filthy habit _f intoxication \u2014 a virtue common to the whole tribe. I have seen many of the Gondolieri who actually knew Tasso by heart, and would recite, or rather chant, whole stanzas, while rowing the passengers along the canals. The practice is, however, rare at present. And, no wonder ! For the very appearance of the German sauer kroute gentry, is sufficient to drive from the heads of these poor fellows, all remembrance of the sweet strains of the divine author of La Geru salemme Liberata !"], [253, "217 VENICE. The Gondolieri are, in general, a robust race of men, remarkably well made, healthy, good looking, cleanly in their persons, and frugal in their mode of living. They participate in the natural gaiety of their country, and pass the greater part of their lives, tete-a-tete with nobles, citizens, and the strangers of distinc tion who daily arrive at Venice. From their native intelligence and vivacity they often start subjects of conversation, and are suffered to use a greater portion of freedom, in their intercourse with passengers, than is usually accorded to persons gaining their livelihood by a manual occupation. Of the truth of this remark, let the reader take the following as an instance. In Venice, the streets are lighted up at night with sma!1 lamps, pretty much in the same way as the streets of Paris. As one of the Gondolieri was drawing the lamp up, a noble patrician, who happened to be passing, desired him to raise it a little higher. Upon which the man answered, \" It is sufficiently high for your and my horns to pass under, but if those of your Excellency are longer than mine, I will certainly draw up the lamp, so that you may pass on without coining in contact with it.\" I had ihis anecdote from the gentleman who was the cause of it,"], [254, "218 VENICE. and who hastened with it to the Casino ; where it formed the subject of the evening's conver sazione, and certainly lost nothing of its spright liness by the manner in which it was related. So attached are the Gondolieri to their watery element, that if they happen to have a dispute with a man coming from Mestre or Fusina, two small towns which are only three or four miles from Venice, and are asked by their comrades who he is, they answer, \" mi so un foresto, chi vien da ga del diavolo \u2014 he is a foreigner, and comes from the devil knows where.\" One of these barcajuoli being on a visit at Genoa to his sister, who was a dancer at the theatre there, happening to be looking at one of the famous stone bridges of that city, a per son accosted him, and asked whether he was not a stranger : the poor fellow answered in the negative. On returning to his sister's lodg ing, he told her, laughingly, what had taken place. \" Vu sta,\" said he, \" che vi conta una beila storia .- stavo guardar quel ponte la su ; mi vien uno a domandarmi se son foresto ?\" \" I hope,\" said his sister, \" you answered yes ?\" \" Buzzera /\" continued he, \" ho detto che son Venezian.\" \" But,\" rejoined his sister, \" you are at this present time at Genoa, and are therefore a stranger.\" It, how-"], [255, "V E N I c I). 219 ever, took a great deal of time to convince the man that he could be a stranger, out of Venice. On the feast of San Rocco, the Doge and Senate used to hear mass at that beautiful church in great sta.e. The procession was conveyed in peotas, or covered barges. I was once present when it was passing under one of the bridges ; where two or three of the unem- ployed Gondolieri belonging to their Excellencies were belabouring with their tongues those who were engaged in rowing the cortege. The wordy contest brought to the windows of their boats the whole of the Signoria, who seemingly enjoyed with much good-natured satisfaction the native sallies of this privileged order. In- deed, the Gondolieri of Venice appear to pos- sess prerogatives similar to those which were formerly exercised by M. de Roquelaure, at the court of Lewis the Fourteenth : \" on leur fait honneur de tous les buns-mots, que des raiso?is de decence ou de politique ne permettent pas aux veritable peres de se declarer.\" From the period of the rupture which took place between the Republic and Benedict the Fourteenth, that Pope refused to give a car dinal's hat to any of the Venetian bishops. At his death, when Rozzonico, the cardinal bishop of Padua, was elected to the holy see, the Gon-"], [256, "220 VENICE. dolieri, as he was a Venetian by birth, were ac customed to say, \" We have long been without hats ; but now we have the hatter \u2014 abbiamo adesso il capelliere.\" The anniversary of the Festa di San Rocco still continues to be the day on which the Vene tian artists exhibit their annual performances in the Scuola di San Rocco. It is one of the first academies in Venice, and is filled with the works of Tintoretto, Titian, Paul Veronese, and other eminent masters. I was amazingly struck with Tintoretto's picture of the Annunciation\u2014 as well as with many others. It has never been ascertained, whether the President Montesquieu paid a visit to Venice as an indifferent traveller, or as a mouchard of the court of France \u2014 (which court was constantly in the habit of giving lhose honourable com missions to persons of all ranks and classes, not excepting the fair sex) \u2014 or whether it was to collect information, from the valuable political manuscripts in which the Republic abounded, and which might furnish matter for his cele brated work, \" I' Esprit des Loix.\" Whatever might have been the President's motives, his conduct during his stay excited considerable suspicion. He was observed run ning from one coffee-house to another ; interro-"], [257, "221 V E N I C E. gating every body who would listen to him ; and taking copies and drawings of every thing he saw and heard. At length he received a significant hint, that his longer stay at Venice would neither be agreeable to the Government nor to the French ambassador ; and at the same time he was particularly cautioned, to be ex tremely careful with regard to his papers ; as, in crossing the lakes from Venice to Fusina, it was not improbable that he would be arrested on his journey. He therefore shortly after took his leave of Venice, with his head full of the Canal Orfano.* The Baron was not arrested ; but, when he was in the middle of the lakes, perceiving another gondola making up to him, he fancied he was going to be attacked, and, in his panic, had recourse to the expedient of Castor, when pur sued by the hunters ; and, taking from his tra- * The rumour runs, that the Venetian Government used to cause their state prisoners to be privately strangled in their cells, and then thrown into the above canal.

The whole, however, was a man\u0153uvre played off to frighten the author of the \" Spirit of Laws.\" If the Baron had had sufficient courage to direct his gondolier to proceed, he would have passed on unmolested ; as the individuals employed to put the trick into execution were ordered not to impede his departure by ex amining his baggage ; but the fear of being pursued by the boats of the Sbirraglia, made the author of u I' Esprit\" lose his spirits, and every other consideration but personal safety. The communications between Venice and various parts of the Terra Firma are so nume rous, that, besides the different Duganas, or custom-houses, the lakes were covered with boats filled with Sbirri; and, if a foreigner hap pened not to be accompanied by an ambassa dor's gondola, he was often subjected to repeated unpleasant visits from this honourable class of Venetian Bow Street runners. They dared not, however, to approach the gondolas of a foreign minister, a consul, or their agents ; which were considered sacred. At that time, every body wore silk stockings, and no person of decent appearance would have thought"], [259, "223 V E N I C E. of entering the theatre, or the casinos, in boots, for fear of being suspected of having been con fined for felony, and of wearing them to hide the marks of the chains on his legs. Such, indeed, was the common observation of the Venetians on persons who were discovered to be thus habited. Though the stocking weavers of Venice were unable to furnish a tenth part of the quantity necessary for the supply of the inhabitants, those manufactured in France were strictly prohibited. But, notwithstanding this prohi bition, every body wore them ; and even the sbirraglia would supply the dealers in contraband goods with them, as well as private families. The Republic therefore thought proper to take off the prohibition, and allowed the stockings to enter the Venetian states, on paying, at the rate ofa livre a pair, duty. The contraband traffic still continuing, the duty was reduced first to half a livre, and next to only twopence the pair; after which, itwas not worth the while, for so small a sum, to run the risk of selling them. Thus was the contraband traffic in stockings put an end to, and the article made a source of considerable revenue to the state ; and thus were many thousands produced to the Government, which before were divided be-"], [260, "224 VENICE. tween a few worthless wretches, who lived by the perversion of that justice, which they were paid liberal salaries to uphold.

Giovedi grasso, Shrove Thursday, was a remarkable day at Venice, for the exercise of many popular amusements. The most attrac tive was, \" II volo dal Campanile di San Marco.\" It was performed in the following manner. An immense cable was fastened to the top of the steeple, which was let down the whole of its length, until it reached the pavement. Both of its extremities being made secure, a man, who was paid for the occasion, after a small cord had been fastened round one of his wrists and another round one of his ancles, would slide down from the topmost extremity to the ground, \\ol. r. Q"], [262, "226 VENICE. bearing a small flag in his hand ; to the great delight and astonishment of the numerous spec tators. To the \" Volo dal Campanile,\" Captain Manby is indebted for his contrivance for saving the lives of shipwrecked mariners ; only he has added thereto a basket, or cradle, in which a man is placed, and propelled forward, like the Venetian flyer of the Giovedi grasso. The moveable pyramids and Moresco broad sword amusements were performed by the Niccolotti and the Castellani, two parties who took their names from the parishes in which they were born. The inhabitants of the said parishes were always, once a-year, opposed to one another in the performance us sundry feats of strength, on two different platforms, erected at a certain distance opposite each other. At the success or failure of any of their evolu tions, violent applauses or hissings were vocife rated by the friends of one party, to the annoy ance of the other. The amusements, or games, consisted in forming pyramids of twenty or thirty men, piled one upon another, beginning with three or four, and increasing the number, according to the figure intended to be exhibited ; sometimes beginning with the greater number, and dimi nishing in size, to a considerable height, until"], [263, "VENICE. 227 the whole terminated with a child, who would climb from one man's shoulder to another, until he had reached the top. When this amusement was over, another would commence. It was called \" il giuoco Moresco,\" and was a sort of attack between the parties with the broadsword. These diversions for the lower orders gene rally took place while the patricians were rusti cating at their delicious villas, on the banks of the Brenta or elsewhere, in all the luxury of eastern splendour. In imitation of the Romans, it was the uni form policy of the Venetians to keep alive a party-spirit between their subjects, and to ply them with amusements, that they might have no leisure for reflection. But in latter times, Venice has, in fact, possessed a numerous popu lation, but no canaglia ; and divided bodies are ever the most easy to govern, and the surest to be conquered. Subtraction is a favourite rule in the arithmetic of politicians, and all govern ments are tolerably perfect in their practice of it. The policy that unfortunately is so preva lent on the Continent, appears to be a close imitation of the doctrines of the Florentine Secretary, Machiavelli, who says, \" With respect to the means of holding in subjection states q 2"], [264, "228 VENICE. once accustomed to be governed by their own laws \u2014 destroy them, especially the nobles and the men of power ; as they can never forget what they have been, and seldom or ever for give those who have been the cause of their privations.\" Though Venice produces nothing, no city in Europe is more abundantly or more luxuriously supplied with the necessaries as well as the delicacies of life. People often come to Venice from the Terra Firma, to enjoy fruit in the highest perfection. As it is brought thither by water carriage, it is not liable to be softened or bruised, and the beautiful bloom is thereby pre served as if it were still on the tree. The Venetian poultry, too, is generally of excellent flavour. The fish also, which come from the sea to fatten themselves in the rich lakes that surround the city, are larger and better flavoured than in any other sea-port. The oysters of the Arsenal were an article of considerable profit to the persons engaged in raising them, and were the largest and best tasted in theworld. As I have touched on the subject of eatables, I shall, for the instruction as well as consolation of our English gourmands, who may be thinking of paying a visit to Italy, here give them a"], [265, "VENICE. 229 slight foretaste of the delicacies for which its principal towns and cities are most celebrated. Piedmont is famous for producing the best rice in the peninsula, and for its truffles, Whicli are dug out of the earth by dogs trained for the occasion, and of a peculiar breed. Milan is the only place for the delicious mascaron, made of fresh cream in little round pats, about the size of half a pound of butter. The Stracchin cheese is of a square form ; it weighs about six or eight pounds, and is made entirely of rich cream. Lodi and Orio are the only parts of Italy that produce the real Parmasan, though it is made in many other provinces. It takes its name from Parma being at one time the principal deposit for the wholesale consumption of it; but not one of these famous cheeses was ever made in that town. At Bergamo are manufactured the best sugar plums, and what is called la mustarda, which consists of a variety of rich fruits preserved in jars, with a mixture of clarified sugar and mus tard. At the time of the Carnival it produces a considerable profit to the dealers therein, as it is sent all over Italy ; as well as a paste made of almonds and sugar, called mandolata. Brescia is famous for a kind of very fat small Q 3"], [266, "230 VENICE. bird, called gl'uccelli dei Ronchi, and for its polenta, or Indian corn. Verona, Este, and Monselice are distinguished for the finest fruits of all kinds, and the salame col aglio, which are large sausages stuffed with garlick. Vicenza is unrivalled for its grapes and sweet wines, which are of a flavour different from that of the wines of all the other parts of Italy. At Padua are made the famous osso callo and fuccacie, which resemble the buns that are cut to make rusks of, but infinitely superior, and especially at Easter. Genoa formerly de rived considerable advantage from the sale of its excellent zucca Candida, its pumkins, its pre served citrons, its large and small pastry of all descriptions, and its candied sweetmeats, dried mushrooms, and vegetables. Parma and Modena are celebrated for their small hams, of a most delicious flavour. They are cut into slices almost as thin as wafers, and packed in boxes ; and, together with their zam pini, a pig's leg with the bone taken out and stuffed with exquisite sausages, once formed a considerable portion of a not inactive com merce, and were sent by the Ducal family, as presents to the several Continental courts. Bologna is the only place in Italy for what are called the bandola investita, and for all"], [267, "231 VENICE. kinds of sausages ; Florence for its perfumery, and, like Lucca, for its oils and rosoglias of herbs, which are exported to all parts of Europe; Rome for its wild and water fowls, its vege tables, and in particular for its brocoli ; Naples for its incomparable mustacciuli, its maccaroni, and its cascia cavallo, a famous cheese used therewith, when not cooked with sughilio, the extract of stewed beef in wine, with all kinds of spices and herbs. The ices of Naples are superior to those of any other part of Italy. The plate-glass manufactory on the island of Murano, at the distance of about a mile from Venice, is perhaps one of the finest in all Europe ; though, like every thing else on the Venetian territory, excepting despotism, it is greatly on the decline. Certain secrets with respect to glass-making were confined to the Venetians. The substance that is to form the mirror, of a certain size, is taken out of the furnace by means of a machine with a wooden handle, and the workmen keep turning it round with the greatest velocity, until it has attained the desired length ; when, with an immense pair of scissors, they cut asunder the fiery sub stance, and instantly roll it on stone, where it congeals, and becomes the most perfect of its kind. The Venetians were also the first who in- q 4"], [268, "232 VENICE. vented the several kinds of glass beads, of various colours and shapes ; and those which they now manufacture, and which are worked into purses, bags, necklaces, and other ornaments, are still the best in all Europe. Burrano was famous for the Venetian point lace ; from which place Louis the Fourteenth seduced a number of the workmen to France, where he established the first lace manufactory. In the same manner, Charles the Fifth esta blished a similar manufactory at Brussels and elsewhere. Was not the very first vessel of war that carried a cannon, of Venetian origin ? Venice was the parent of other maritime states; and, to such a pitch of perfection had she arrived, that the dresses, the manners, and the customs of her inhabitants were adopted by the rest of Europe, long before the reign of Queen Eliza beth. A slight reference to the plays of the immortal Shakespeare, will convince the reader, that that great master of the passions and pro found judge of human nature, was accustomed to consider the Venetians, as they were repre sented in the portraits of Titian and others, to be models of elegance in dress ; the men wear ing their beards, and the women their brocades, bracelets, &c. He repeatedly compliments the"], [269, "V E n r C E. 233 Venetians; and, in \"Love's Labour Lost,\" makes one of his characters exclaim \" Ah, good old Mantuan ! I may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice Venegia, Venegia, Chi non te vide, ei non te pregia.\" that is, \" O Venice, Venice, he who has never seen thee, has thee not in esteem. \" The circumstance ofthe corps diplomatique being interdicted from every kind of intercourse with the patricians and the Government, ex cept on public occasions, in consequence of the conspiracy against the Republic formed by the Marquis of Bedmar, ambassador from the court of France, in conjunction with the Duke d'Ossuno and the Spanish governor of the Milanese, suggested the story of Otway's Venice Preserved. An amazing number of merchants of all na tions settled themselves at Venice, and were tolerated in the enjoyment of their different religions, and protected in the free exercise of them. There was a quarter for the Germans, and another for the Turks, who were not per mitted to be seen out of their habitations after sunset. The number of libraries, printing offices, and of booksellers' shops at Venice ex-"], [270, "234 VENICE. ceeded that of any other city of Italy. The communication, by means of canals, with most of the large rivers of the Terra Firma, gave the greatest facilities to every kind of commerce. In short, no foreigner possessing genius and industry could leave Venice but with regret. For years after he had quitted that city, Cardinal de Bernis was accustomed to speak of the spot, and of its inhabitants, with the greatest warmth of delight. When tlie Lombards and the Jews ceased to have the advantage of the Venetian navigation, they emigrated, with their immense riches, to England ; and, to the rich bankers who laid out their vast capitals in building, is London in debted for the well known street which has ever since born their name. The Jews who remained at Venice set about repairing their losses, by becoming money lenders to all the sovereigns' of Europe ; and, from the enormous profits which they derived from the interest they exacted, were they enabled to build the Ghetto, a place of residence exclusively appropriated for the Israelitish tribe, situate near the canal Regio ; and the gates of which, after sunset, were closed, and not a soul was suffered to enter or go out. In this part of the city they were compelled to"], [271, "235 VENICE. reside, until the revolution took place in 1796. It formed a little town of itself, and as the Venetian nobility declined, commerce became almost entirely confined to that quarter. The Lombards were, to the full, as usuriously in clined as the sons of Israel were. The rate of interest to be taken on their loans and money transactions was regulated by the tribunal of the Pioveggi. Let me here digress for a moment, and offer a word or two in behalf of the much vilified and much despised Jewish nation. In an age like the present, teeming with benevolent pro jects of all descriptions, and overflowing with the milk and honey of universal philanthropy, surely it behoves the several governments of the civilized world to take the condition of this most remarkable people into their serious consideration, and, together with the other re strictions imposed on them, to do away with the harsh, as well as impolitic law which prevents a Hebrew from possessing landed property, by which he becomes of course exempted from certain contributions towards the expenses of the state, paid by all other classes of his Ma jesty's subjects. Many of these Jews, as we all know, are excellent members of society, and deserve to be set free from those disgraceful"], [272, "236 VENICE. shackles, which were thought neccessary in the early ages of Christianity. I have been credibly informed, that all the tribes feel the privations to which they are sub jected most poignantly. Ought we then to be surprised, if we sometimes find them immo lating on the altar of avarice, those miserable Christians who resort to them for loans in the hour of distress, and exclaiming, in the lan guage of Shylock, with feelings partaking less of remorse, than of fell revenge ? \"lama Jew : and, hath not a Jew eyes ? hath not a Jew hands? organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is ? If you prick us, do we not bleed ? if you tickle us, do we not laugh ? if you poison us, do we not die ? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge ? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. Isa Jew wrong a Chris tian, what is his humility ? revenge : If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example ? why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute ; and it shall go hard, but I will better the instruction.\" Satisfied I am, that until a complete and entire amalgamation of the two parties shall have been effected, the mutual interest of Christian and Jew will not have been placed on its proper basis."], [273, "VENICE. 237 Formerly, the kings of England were accus tomed to look upon the descendants of Abra ham as their property ; indeed, they were expressly called the king's \" chattels.\" So strong did the popular tide run against them, that in the year 1348, when a fatal endemic distemper raged in a great portion of Europe, it was given out that they had poisoned the springs and wells : in consequence of which, a million and a half of them were cruelly mas sacred. Again, in the year 1492, half a million of them were driven out of Spain, and one hun dred and fifty thousand out of Portugal. In short, they were every where persecuted, and most rigorously treated. In Spain, many of them were actually burnt alive, and their sufferings became a source of amusement to the people. The satirical Doctor Swift, in his celebrated Drapier's Letters, tells a story of a Jew at Madrid, who being con demned to the fire on account of his religion, a crowd of school -boys following him to the stake, and apprehending they might lose their sport if he should happen to recant, would, from time to time, clap him on the back, and cry, \u00ab Sta forme, Moyse /\" that is \u2014 \" Moses, continue stedfast.\""], [274, "238 VENICE. If my memory does not fail me, Mr. Hob house, one of the representatives for West minster, the most enlightened city in the empire, signified, some time ago, his determination to bring the case of this oppressed people fairly before the British Parliament. Most earnestly do I hope that this active senator will persevere in his intention ; and happy, thrice happy shall I be, if the present intimation should have a tendency, however trifling, to spur him on to a perseverance in his praiseworthy design. His unwearied endeavours to procure for us the light of heaven, untaxed, are duly appreciated by his countrymen ; and I will add, by his coun trywomen also . and Mr. Hobhouse may rest assured, that an endeavour to dispel the mental darkness which has been engendered by that \" sufferance,\" which, for so many ages, has been \" the badge of all the tribe,\" will be con sidered no less laudable. That he will be seconded in his efforts by all those members who uniformly advocate the cause of free discussion and of universal tolera tion, I cannot, for one moment, doubt. Guess ing from their patronymics, several of our sena tors cannot be far removed in blood from the oppressed race : to suppose, therefore, that they would not joyfully step forward, and afford the"], [275, "VENICE* 239 representative for Westminster their cordial support, would be to suppose them possessed by the marble-hearted fiend, Ingratitude ; which, when it shows itself in a child, has been pro nounced \" more hideous than the sea-monster.\" But, while the Senate shall be thus actively occupied in the cause of the sons of Israel, ought not the Stage to step forward, and lend its powerful aid towards the accomplishment of the alta impresa? To this end, I beg leave, strenuously to recommend to Mr. Elliston, the spirited lessee of Drury Lane Theatre, a revival of thelate Mr. Cumberland'sadmirablecomedyof \" The Jew.\" The play was eminently successful, at a time by no means so favourable for the incul cation of the principles I am laying down as the present. In the hands of that chastest of all performers, Mr. Dowton, Sheva would find as able a representative as Doctor Cantwell has done. Liston, too\u2014 the laugh-inspiring Liston \u2014 in the part of Jabal, the Jew's servant, would delight the town not less than he has done in Mawworm. To heighten the attraction, songs, according to the custom of the day, might be introduced with considerable effect. The part of Frederick might be allotted to Braham ; while Eliza Radcliffe would find an interesting representative in the sweet warbler Stephens."], [276, "240 VENICE. Thus, instead of receiving our impressions of the whole tribe, from \" the Jew which Shake speare drew,\" \u2014 brutal, vindictive, uncharitable, extortionate, his bags running over with the spoils of usury, and his veins glutted with the blood of prodigals, gamesters, and unfortunate merchants, we should constantly have before our eyes, the generous Hebrew of Cumberland, \u2014 the widow's friend, the orphan's father, the poor man's protector, and the universal philan thropist; who \"neither buries his riches ina synagogue or any other pile, nor wastes it upon vanity or public works ; but who leaves it to a charitable heir, and builds his hospital in the human heart.\" Thus would the stray sheep of the scattered flock of Abraham at length have fair play ; and, that such an appeal to the kind feelings, the good sense, and the strict justice of Englishmen, would be made in vain, is, I think, impossible \u2014 \" In hearts like theirs', there will be found a place, For ev'ry victim of unjust disgrace.\""], [277, "241 > CHAPTER XXIII.

Many of the noble Venetians were accus tomed to advance money for carrying on the commerce of the Republic, and were indirectly connected with the merchants ofthe Terra Firma, At Verona, Padua, and Vicenza, there were considerable manufactories of silks, gauzes, ribbons, artificial flowers, and whalebone : there were also cloth manufactures at Schio, and other places in the territories of the Republic. At Venice, too, the same manufactures were carried on, but in still greater variety ; such as rich damasks, brocades, gold and silver tissues, and velvets. The gold chains of Venice, with its gold lace and trimmings, were the admiration of all Europe. The city was also celebrated VOL. i. it"], [278, "242 VENICE. for its wax, and cream of tartar ; for its glass and pearl beads ; for its silk stockings and lace; and particularly for its scarlet cloth and snuffs. The triacca manufactured at Venice, is used as a general medicine ; it is composed of various drugs, and is considered to be an antidote against the sting of venomous reptiles. Many of the above articles were at one time a source of considerable profit to the ambassadors, con suls, and other agents of the Republic, at the several foreign courts, on account of their great superiority over those of other nations. Its numerous festivals rendered Venice one of the most interesting cities in the universe. Amongst others, there were those of Santa Marta, San Rocco, il Redentore, la Saluta, San Marco, Corpus Domine, and the Assenzione ; on the latter of which days the Doge used to go to Lido, a small island two miles from Venice, near the entrance of the Adriatic, for the pur pose of espousing that sea, in the Bucentoro, a vessel somewhat resembling the ancient Greek and Roman gallies. It was richly carved, and covered with fine gold in basso-relievo, lined with the richest crimson silk velvet, trimmed with gold fringe and tassels, and furnished in the most elegant and costly manner, with beau tiful Venetian mirrors, crystal cut ornaments,"], [279, "243 VENICE. large pier glass windows, with Venetian blinds and crimson silk curtains. It used to be towed out by a number ofthe barcajuoli, richly dres sed in the ancient Venetian costume, with caps and sashes of different colours, all bearing the Doge's livery. The Doge was habited in his ducal robes, his coronet, and the other insignia of his high office. The whole body of the. senators, with their wives and families, magni ficently attired, joined the procession in gon dolas, together with all the foreign ministers, and often a hundred thousand persons, coming not only from the Terra Firma, but from the extre mity of Italy, and even of Europe ; so that the water, from the ducal palace of the Piazzetta to Lido, was actually covered with boats, filled with youth and beauty in all their most seduc tive shapes and appearances, forming an entire carpet of boats of all descriptions ; besides peottis, in the shape of ancient temples and tri umphal cars, representing the courts of Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Bacchus, Apollo, together with Neptune, and the rest of the marine deities ; so that it was scarcely possible to discover a foot of water. The ceremony was called the marriage of the sea. The Doge, on his arrival at the mouth of the harbour, came on deck, and being sur- r 2"], [280, "244 VENICE. rounded by the senate, he took from his finger a gold ring, and throwing it into the sea, he pronounced these words, \" Disponsamus te, Mare ! in signum veii perpetuique dominii ;\" that is, \" We espouse thee, O sea ! in token of real and perpetual dominion.\" The Doge and senate then returned in the same order to the ducal palace, where a sump tuous banquet was prepared, consisting of all the delicacies of the season ; and at the close of which each senator was presented with a large tray, or basket, filled with the choicest fruits and sweetmeats, to take home to his family. This was indeed a day of festivity and triumph for the Venetians, and turned out highly lucra tive to all classes of the inhabitants. The famous ducal barge of which I have spoken, the Bucentoro, which, as its name im plies, was capable of containing two hundred persons, was destroyed by the French for the sake of its gold, and chopped in pieces, together with four-and-twenty ships of war in the arse nal. Nay, the very arsenal itself was nearly demolished by those modern liberators. It was wittily observed by one of the barcajuoli to his comrades, \" I Francese non sono tutti ladri, ma Buona-parte !\" The French also destroyed the famous beds of oysters which were formerly"], [281, "VENICE. 245 in the arsenal, and which were esteemed the largest and finest flavoured in Europe. After the festivities of the Ascension the Venetians commenced their villegiatura, or rural diversions, on both sides of the banks of the Brenta ; which, for the space of one-and-twenty miles, as far as Padua, are ornamented with numerous beautiful palaces, built by Palladio and Sansovino, and the fronts of many of which were painted by Paul Veronese. These palaces are the villas of the patricians and of the rich merchants. The country along the Brenta is really a terrestrial paradise. In my opinion, there is no spot of the globe that can be placed in compa rison with it. The meadows and gardens all around are highly cultivated and fertile, and terminate most agreeably. What is very extra ordinary, no two of the palaces are alike. Most of them have their fronts looking towards the river. I did not, however, recognize in the Brenta, so readily as Mr. Addison seems to have done, the Timavus \u2014 Unde per ora novem vasto cum murmure montis, It mare proruptum, et pelago premit arva sonanti ;\" though Virgil adds, \" Hie tamen ille urbem Patavi sedesque locavit Teucrorum.\" r3"], [282, "246 VENICE. The mode of living during the villegiatura, was exactly the same as at Venice- The ladies never rose till the middle of the day. After breakfast they put on their morning dress, and either walked or rode out : they would then come home, and after taking the bath, dress for dinner ; at five they would take coffee, sleep till seven or eight, prepare for the evening par ties, which continued till about midnight, and then go to the casinos to play at cards, or for the sake of the conversazione ; and at about two or three in the morning, and sometimes later, they would return home to rest. The opera at Venice did not commence till between nine and ten, and was seldom over before two or three in the morning ; but no.lady of rank would even then think of going home, before she had taken a few hands at the casino. On some mornings they would visit the Erberia, to see the delightful fruits and flowers brought to the market from the Terra Firma, and then they would go home to bed. The Benzona, the Albrizzi Teutocchi, the Giustina Micheli, the Tron, the Cavaliera Con tarini, the Labbia, the Pesaro, and in short all the ladies of the haut-ton, would not, when young, have thought of shewing themselves in society before midnight. But now, alas ! they"], [283, "247 VENICE. are all the worse for the wear ; and though they still adhere to the old proverb, that \" women and linen look to the greatest advantage by candle-light,\" and though tight lacing and long waisted stays will go a good way towards hiding much superabundant substance, the ill-natured old gentleman with his scythe, however much the diurnal supply of blooming roses and of fresh lilies may put new faces on old bodies, is constantly holding up his hour-glass, and intimat ing that he has little or no respect for a figure of 6 with an 0 after it. It may, however, be laid down as a maxim, that women are as old as they look, and men as old as they feel. Old women, like old gui neas, are worth their weight in gold. Madame Tron was once very much offended with a gen tleman who asked her how old she was ? \" I never give myself the trouble,\" replied she, \"to think about my enemies.\" \u2014 \"Well,\" said the gentleman, \" we were children together, and I am seventy.\" \u2014 \" What's that to me ?\" rejoined Madame Tron.\u2014\" Yes, but you have a daugh ter who is between forty and fifty.\"\u2014 \" And pray, Mr. Busybody, what has the age of my daughter to do with mine ? Thank God,\" said she, \" the Libro d'Oro is destroyed,\" (which was the register of the ages of all the patri- r 4"], [284, "248 VENICE. cians) ; \" at least we have gained that by the revolution ; there is no more prying into the secret ofa woman's age, Mr. Inquisitive !\" The palace of Madame Benzona, on the grand canal, near San Benedetto, together with the distinguished beauty and the great merits of this Venetian matron, though so often sung and so universally admired, ought not to he passed over in silence, in a work professing to contain anecdotes ofa city, in which, from her amiable and polished manners, she has shone forth so pre-eminently. The mansion of this celebrated lady, though she is now in very slender circumstances, con tinues to be visited by the natives, as well as by foreigners of the first distinction. Her name stands high on the annals of gallantry, both for her extraordinary condescension, and for her easy and indiscriminate compliance, from the prince down to the barcajuolo. The prop of her house is said to be the Cavalier Giuseppe Trevis, a rich Jew merchant. Being of a very tolerant disposition, persons of all religions as well as nations, are received by her on terms of equal hospitality and good breeding. Her house is also visited by Pindemonte Lamberti, the translator of Homer, and by other men of genius ; though she has recently been excluded"], [285, "VENICE. 249 the society of the court converzatione, in con sequence of German etiquette, whereby blood only constitutes merit, and merit without blood is considered, like a race-horse, as having no merit at all. Madame Abrizzi Tuetocchi was first married to the poor Bernabotti Marini. Finding it more convenient, after having had a son by her rich cavalier servante, to become the wife of Al brizzi, the father of this lady, in furtherance of her views (though she had been married nearly twenty years, and had had a son by her hus band, who is a father of a family), came forward to declare that he had violated his daughter's inclinations ; by which declaration alone a ca tholic marriage can be dissolved. The father was nearly eighty years of age when his scru ples of conscience induced him to be the osten sible person thus to administer to his daughter's good fortune. The husband Marini, the hus band Albrizzi, the two sons, and the good lady, all live together in a state of the most profound miscellaneous harmony. She is a Greek ; is ambitious in her friendships ; a profound calcu lator ; and in every thing an extraordinary woman. Zorzetto Ricchi, the husband of the well known Cecilia Tron, is a native of Corfu. He"], [286, "250 VENICE. is an able politician ; has been an advocate for democracy as well as for imperialism ; and would become the meanest slave of Ali Pacha, for the sake of promotion and personal interest. No man sympathizes more in the successes of the weather-cock politicians of the day than Zorzetto does : for he runs no risk, and is sure to find that which he has not lost! Whenever he happens to be pushed for the needful, the Greek artfully invents some story of illness, or of hair breadth scapes from jeopardy, to soften the feelings of his better half. Promises of certain domestic duties towards her, and better beha viour for the future, generally end in softening the heart of the old lady. He does not live with her, but occupies the magnificent Palazzo- Tron, on the grand canal. The lady lives in private lodgings at Padua, where she is visited by her husband as often as his pecuniary neces sities call him thither. Eugenia Tron, the wife of the Bernabotti Giovanni Veronese, better known by the nick name of bocca storta, crook-mouthed, is a lady of some vivacity in repartee. Though disgust ingly ugly in the face, she possesses a remark ably fine figure. Being at a masked ball during carnival time, she was one night much followed, and particularly by a gentleman who was then"], [287, "VENICE. 251 paying his addresses to the beautiful Cavaliera Donado, known by the name of \" la beila Veneziana.\" Having discovered whom he was following, she cried out to him, \" Lasciatela, e la bocca storta ;\" \" leave her, it is th- crook mouthed lady.\" Hearing this, Eugenia Tron instantly replied, \" e vero che son brutta di viso ma egli sa che tengo un paradiso.\" And most assuredly she must have had some very powerful hidden charms ; for some of the handsomest young men in all Venice paid their assiduous court to her. Ludovico Friuli, M. A. Giustin gan, Tommassini, and many other elegant and fashionable men of rank, were constantly amongst the number of her admirers. She possessed a Uberal, a generous, and a noble soul : even when reduced in her circumstances, she pre ferred living in a miserably obscure retirement, rather than become chargeable to her friends and former admirers. She has since retired to Corfu, where she possesses a baronia. Chiaretta Contarini was a perfect beauty, but a thorough-paced dunce. Though illiterate to a degree, she had a furious craving after the treasures of science. When at the public as semblies, or at the coffee-shops, she would call for \" un bicchier d'acqua corrotta,\" which means"], [288, "252 VENICE. a glass of water in mourning ; instead of \" un bicchier d'acqua corretta,\" a glass of water cor rected, by having a little aniseed put into it ; which is a common beverage at Venice,* simple water being in that country considered very unwholesome. She would also say she was going to the \" vigillatura,\" instead of \" ville giatura,\" and make a thousand blunders ofthe same kind. On one of her favourites, a French officer, being taken ill, she asked him to let her feel his pulse ; but, unfortunately, instead of saying \" laissez moi tater votre pouls,\" she said, \" laissez moi tater votre qu \u2014 .\" The officer said, it was not the custom in France, and politely begged to decline the proffered civility. Her little casino resembled a large sea-port town, and was open to bales of all descriptions, on payment of the transit duties. In the list of her numerous admirers, some of them men of talent, were Bianchi, and Carlo Pino, a Milanese, and brother of the general of that name. He was appointed by the Austrian Government at Venice, to be one of the justices; as if there were not among the Venetians men capable of filling the situation ! Family intrigue procured him the place, and petticoat interest supported it His brother, the general, being of the French"], [289, "VENICE. 253 party, each of them took different sides, resolved to adhere to the one which should be the most successful. Both Bianchi and Carlo Pino lived with C'hiaretta in the same house. No ridiculous jealousies interrupted the harmony which sub sisted between the lawyer and the justice; pro vided they shared in the spoils, they cared not \" if the general camp, pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body.\" They were too liberal minded to think of monopolizing so much beauty and virtue ; and therefore left the lady to in crease an influence, which, in the end, turned out to the profit ofthe trio. Chiaretta Contarini had three husbands, all living at the same time. The first was Dofiln, who, being poor, was either expelled or bought off by Grimani, a younger son of the family of that name. He was succeeded by the potent Contarini ; whom, however, Chiaretta survived, and she now resides at Milan. Being by nature yielding, liberal of her favours, and tolerant in her principles, men of all nations and religions are received by her with open arms. No woman was ever more calculated to shine in a revolution than Chiaretta Contarini. She was a Turk with the Musselmen, a Jewess with the sons of Israel, a Protestant with the Reformists, and a Catholic"], [290, "254 VENICE. from hypocrisy, convenience, and interest. She strived hard to get hold of some rich Jew of the Ghetto, and endeavoured to rival Marina Benzona in the good graces of the Cavalier Trevis ; but the fidelity of the Israelite remained unshaken. As soon as the above-mentioned Carlo Pino found the power of Buonaparte in Italy firmly established, he quitted the Austrian service at Venice, and repaired to his native home, to live with his long neglected wife and family. His brother, the general, being the war-minister, soon got him employed at Milan ; but having taken French leave of Chiaretta, and having given her, in an unguarded moment, a personal security of some magnitude, she soon followed him to enforce the payment of it. Not being able to comply therewith, and Chiaretta having, besides her pension of two livres a-day, collected together a small annuity, he persuaded her to take up her abode at Milan ; where, though advanced in years, she still continues to receive company; and where her conversation continues to be the same strange melange of blunder, wit, and detraction, that it was wont to be in her youthful days. Madame Giustina Venier, the wife of Mark Anthony Micheli, is a lady who has, with the"], [291, "VENICE. 255 assistance of her English friends, translated some of Shakespeare's plays. She has also lately written a little book, called \" Feste Vene ziane,\" in the composition of which she has resorted too much to her inventive faculties, and has trusted more to the brilliancy of her imagination than to the truth of history. She is a gay and lovely dame, and was, for a long time, the chere amie of an English gentleman of the name of Parr. She was formerly a very interesting little figure, and had a most engaging countenance ; but so negligent was she of her person, and so filthy in her dress, that she was more fitted to be the companion of Diogenes than of a well-bred Englishman. To her unpar donable neglect in these matters was this lively little creature indebted for the loss of her paramour ; who parted with her for one who was as ugly as sin, and who had no earthly virtue but ths one in which his former Dulcinea was so deficient. This circumstance, added to the loss of hearing, have so changed her former character, that most of her intimate friends and acquaintances have forsaken her ; and, in con sequence thereof, she has followed the wise conduct of many a female, who, finding herself neglected bv her lovers, returns to the embraces of her husband. From the very habit of attach-"], [292, "256 VENICE. ment, some of these southern ladies, when they can find no one to love or be loved by, turn religious bigots, and, for the mere want of earthly objects of enjoyment, transfer their affec tions to God and the Church, make a merit of necessity, and die with the reputation of being Saints ! To such elderly dames may be applied what Pope says of Narcissa : \u2014 \" A very heathen in the carnal part, Yet still a sad, good Christian at her heart.\" Marina Benzona was the only Venetian lady who had the honour of being visited by the late Queen Caroline of England ; to whom, and to her suite, Marina gave an evening's entertain ment.

Venice once the Seat qf Music Pacchierotti Marchesi Hints for the Preservation ofthe Voice Rubinelli Madame Mara Conduct qf the Proprietors qf the Fenice towards a certain \" Great Lady in the Little Par lour.\" Anecdotes of Mrs. Billington. r u tzr Venice was, at one time, the seat of music, and had established her conservatoires long be fore any other country had done so. The Men dicanti, and the Zitelle, and the Ospidaletto, were as famous for vocal as for instrumental performers. Their masters were the celebrated Bertoni, Bianchi, and Mayer ; and, in the Lent season, the oratorios were as well executed and as numerously attended, as those of any other city in Europe. None of the natives of Italy have a more refined musical taste than the Venetians. Pac chierotti, with all his defects, was enchanting, whenever he happened to sing in tune, as he always addressed himself to the heart ; while Marchesi, with ten times his ability and natural gifts, often disgusted, in consequence of his vol. i. s"], [294, "258 VENICE. deviations from that nature, the want of whicli Pacchierotti contrived to supply, by a re finement of art, which no other singer, male or female, has hitherto been able to attain. His habit of singing below pitch did not arise from want of ear, or of musical science, but from excessive sensibility, whereby his me taphysical powers often got the better of his physical \u2014 a circumstance which is rarely or never the case with the musical professors of the north, who, in general, sing in too sharp a key, from their want of ear as well as of feeling. It is certainly most desirable to be perfectly in tune ; but the singing in too flat a key depends on numerous physical causes, which produce the effect of imperfect intonation, and proceeds not uncommonly from weakness of the lungs or chest. In short, the human voice is of so deli cate a nature, that every trifling thing that mili tates against the health is prejudicial to it. It is the height of folly in singers to fancy that the use of one particular liquid can be more ser viceable than the use of another. Nothing on earth will preserve the voice ; though the abuse of any thing may tend greatly to destroy it. A regular course of diet, accompanied with mode rate exercise, is all that is required. It is, how ever, what few persons who have attained any"], [295, "VENICE. 259 celebrity in that elegant and most fascinating science, sufficiently attend to. It seems, indeed, as if nature had bestowed this valuable gift on the most abject of her creatures. The moment those miserable beings, who may be said to belong to neither gender, and whom I know not under what description of animals to classify \u2014 the moment they are pronounced duly qualified, they are taught mu sic, though ignorant of every other social accom plishment. In that science they become pro ficients ; but, in every thing else these castrati gentlemen are little better than brutes. It is, however, a well attested fact, that Mrs. Conway, the Princess Albani, Annetta Brignole, Chia retta Contarini, the Grassini, and many other females, were prodigiously attached to Mar chesi. The crime, however, carries its own punishment along with it ! Deprived, in early life, of the advantages of a liberal education, the animals of whicli I have been speaking, the moment good fortune calls them into public notice, puffed up by the applauses lavished on their superficial capacities, are found deficient of those prin ciples and those virtues, by which every other class of human beings is distinguished. There is, however, no rule without an exception. Some T ~"], [296, "260 VENICE. few of them have been found who were capable of reading their parts ; especially the children of professional parents, who had taught them at least the science of music, whereby they have been enabled to secure to themselves a com fortable subsistence in their old age. Pacchierotti was one of the best educated singers in all Italy, and had associated in early life with men of letters. Rubinelli had good natural abilities, and was very grateful to the English, for the encouragement he met with while in this country. Aprilli was quite the gentleman in public society, except when he spoke on music, and thereby instantly dis covered himself to be of the neuter gender. Crescentini, who was a close imitator of Pac chierotti, was also an excellent musico. Sene sino and Damiani, who ranked amongst the second class of these beings, always sang in tune, and with infinitely more judgment than Marchesi ; who, for the sake of a roulade, would sacrifice the finest poetical sentiment of the great Metastasio. Crescentini is also said to have been very liberal. He made the Grassini a present of a valuable diamond ring, when she sang with him at Venice, in the opera of the Orazii and Curiazzii ; and it is reported that it was in consequence of some such weighty rea-"], [297, "261 VENICE. son, that she was induced to interest herself with Napoleon, to give him the order of the Iron Cross. In one style of singing Madame Mara, and in another Mrs. Billington, not only excelled all who had gone before them, but every one of their contemporaries, as well as every one who has come after them. As our English favourite, poor Mrs. Bland, once justly observed, \"they are all mere school-girls to them.\" Being one night at Mr. Bochsa's oratorios, and hearing one of the present race of singers execute some of her favourite songs, Madame Mara was asked by a friend who was sitting with her in the same box, what she thought of her? \" She dances a tolerably good fandango,\" was her answer ; and it was, I think, as severe a slap at the judgment of the audience, and at the mediocrity of the singer, as can be well conceived. There is a certain Italian female, possessing, un doubtedly, some pretensions to natural abilities, who had the good fortune to come to England when the two great singers I have just men tioned, were on the decline, and when the war left her field-marshal of the musical forces. The French say, that \" Madame bat les \u0153ufs, et Monsieur son epoux fait 1' omelette:\" and this is s 3"], [298, "262 VENICE. certainly true; for no pastry-cook ever made more puffs, or paid more for newspaper panegyrics than this \" great lady in the little parlour\" has done. When last in Italy, she used to make a boast, that his present Majesty, when Prince Regent, would take her under his arm, and conduct her to the tea-parties of his mother, the late Queen Charlotte, and those of his sisters, the Princesses. The royal family of Bavaria were not, however, quite so conde scending to this companion of English royalty ; for they gave directions that the lady, bedizened with diamonds, as well as her husband, Signor Bragone, should be turned out of a box, which, in her presumption, she had taken possession of, a little too near to the one occupied by the royal family. For this mortification of her vanity she has only herself to blame ; since, both the King and Queen of Bavaria are distinguished for their affability and kindness towards all professional persons \u2014 provided those persons keep their proper places. This singer lost an engagement at the theatre of the Fenice at Venice for the present Carnival, in consequence of a trifling mistake which her French husband made in his calculations. Fan cying that if his spouse was engaged to sing at Venice, all the post horses on the high-roads"], [299, "263 VENICE. leading to that city would be in a state of re quisition, for the purpose of conveying the different sovereigns of Europe, and the treasures that would be expended at the theatre on the occasion, modestly proposed to the managers, that they should share the same with his wife, half and half. The question was put to the vote ; when, out of the fifty proprietors of the theatre at Venice, eight-and-forty black-balled the Frenchman's impudent proposition \u2014 there by inflicting a just punishment on inordinate presumption ! I have too great a reverence for the works of the Supreme Being not to esteem merit, in whatever shape it presents itself; but I must say, that I think that that merit loses much of its charm, when it is found united to vanity and avarice. Justice, however, compels me to declare, that this singer, like some of our own admired ac tresses, is untainted in her pri vate character. But, the pride of some ofthe musical foreigners, who pay their visits to John Bull, ought to be hum bled ; and especially the pride of this lady, whose star has certainly shone more propi tiously in this our northern climate, than it ever did in her own, or in any other country. t 4"], [300, "264 V E N I C !_. How different in disposition, and, alas, in con duct, was our incomparable warbler Mrs. Bil lington ! As the following anecdotes of this celebrated singer convey, to my mind, a not uninstructive lesson to such of my fair country women as may be in possession of this most fascinating, as well as most dangerous, of all God's gifts, when unaccompanied by good con duct, I shall introduce them into the present chapter. Mrs. Billington came to Naples in the year 1794, accompanied by her husband, a double bass player, and her brother Charles Weischell, the famous performer on the violin. She was soon engaged to sing at the theatre San Carlo ; andon her account Signor Bianchi was instructed to set to music the opera of Ines di Castro ; into which, in consequence of her defective memory, she instructed him to introduce a favourite song, which she had for years been giving in London, composed by Salicri. Bianchi complied with her request, but added thereto a few bars and three cadenzas, in order that she might change them in the course of the opera ; Cimarosa also wrote three ; the German composer, Hermil, added three more ; while Marescalche, one of the orchestra, and a music seller, likewise contri-"], [301, "265 VENICE. buted three ; making up amongst them a round dozen, all of them obligatos, which she was to sing, accompanied by her brother the violinist. It will scarcely be credited, that this most skilful singer possessed so little nature and so much science, that she actually began the Car nival with the first cadenza, and ended it, with out varying a note during the whole time. Whatever she had determined on doing, she executed to the greatest perfection ; but in point of genius, and at variations, or at an im promptu, she was a mere dunce, and, in every respect, what the Italians call una testa dura. Mrs. Billington had not been long at Naples before she attracted the attention of princes, dukes, barons, counts, and commoners. Her amazing musical powers, with her great per sonal charms, and the facility with which those charms were yielded up, and perhaps for the first time opposed by her hitherto complaisant husband, gave birth to a rumour of his having been carried off by poison. The occasion of it was this. On the second day of her first engagement at the theatre San Carlo, after she and Mr. Bil lington had been dining with an English family who were lodging in the same hotel, he went up stairs to fetch the cloak in which she was"], [302, "266 VENICE. about to go to the theatre, when, while in the act of putting it on her shoulders, without uttering a syllable, he dropped down at her feet, and expired ! Great suspicions were entertained that this sudden event had been occasioned by poison ; but, the characters both of Mr. and Mrs. Bil lington were too well established in the world of gallantry, to render the supposition that the husband, through jealousy, had taken poison, credible, or that the wife had administered the potion for the sake of gratifying her passions ad libitum. No, no ! Mr. and Mrs. Billington understood each other's necessities far better ! The easy compliances ofthe lady were too pro fitable to the fiddler, to render such a result probable. Mrs. Billington, however, soon consoled her self for the loss of her double-bass husband, in the arms of those who performed more to her satisfaction on the strings of her heart, not only during the remainder of her stay at Naples, but in every town which she visited. Her vast musical talents, added to her nightly personal fame, never failed to furnish her with what the French call de grande pratique. Lovers, ad mirers, cavalieri servanli, were accepted by her and dismissed, as easily as fashions are taken up"], [303, "267 VENICE. and laid down, according as inclination, or rea sons of a more solid nature, happened to pre dominate. Happily for the public at large, no individual occupied her undivided attention, until, by a turn of the wheel of fortune, she found herself engaged at the theatre della Scala at Milan. Here it was that Mrs. Bil lington got acquainted with a fellow of the name of Filisan, a native of Lyons, who had, it is said, been one of the active murderous agents, employed against the unfortunate nobi lity, who fell by wholesale in the Place du bel Course of that city, by cannon a la mitraille ; it being then thought more expeditious, as itwas at a time of the year when the days were getting short, and at a period when the blood-hounds had a deal of business on their hands, to fire on the wretched victims of revolutionary phrenzy in groups, than to dispatch them separately by the sainte guillotine. The work of slaughter being at length ac complished, Filisan followed the army of cut throats to Italy, and arrived with it at Milan, in the capacity of a garde-magasin. Being in the prime of youth, possessing a fine athletic figure and other personal advantages, he soon got introduced to the company of the folies des menus plaisirs, who formed the corps de ballet ;"], [304, "268 VENICE. and, step by step, he ingratiated himself into the society of the principal dancers at the theatre della Scala, and amongst the rest into the society of the Zerbi, a lady who was at that time as celebrated for her feats on the \" light fantastic toe,\" as she was for the liberality with which she dispensed her personal favours; and who afterwards, though a woman of the lowest extraction, and the sister of a sbirro, became the wife of Alvise Manin, nephew to the last Doge of Venice : whom, by the bye, she has ruined by her extravagance. Finding, however, that her connection with Filisan was unfavourable to her private specu lations, and having also, on sundry occasions, felt the weight of his massy fist on her slender and elegant shoulders, and the nimbleness of his fingers in her pockets, whenever she brought home her earnings from the theatre, she thought proper to discard from her favour a man, whom she found intent on gratifying his amour propre at the expense of her professional labours. In this unsatisfactory state ofhis affairs Filisan cast his eyes about, and at last fixed them on Mrs. Billington, who was then singing at the same theatre ; and, so well did the wary French man play his part, that in a very short time the lady became Madame Filisan, to the great as-"], [305, "VENICE. 269 tonishment as well as regret of all her real friends; for the fellow's finances were at that time in so deplorable a state, notwithstanding his filchings from the Zerbi, and his gambling speculations, that, on the day of his wedding, he was scarcely possessed of a second shirt: at least, such is the story which Mrs. Billington herself told to Sarah, her cousin, who lived with her from the time she left England, in the capacity of a menial servant. Being thus raised from a state of misery and wretchedness to one of comparative affluence, Filisan now dressed himself out in an elegant French uniform, and Mrs. Billington caused it to be reported, that she had purchased him a commission, which entitled him to wear it. This, however, was not the case. In a short time after her marriage, the poor lady had bitter cause to lament the step she had taken. Her face and arms exhibited constant proofs of the Frenchman's pugnacious powers ; even before the honey-moon had expired. Jus tice, however, speedily overtook him. For his impudence in wearing the French uniform, and for his other fourberies, he was publicly flogged, in St. Mark's Place, at Venice, by order of General Serrurier ; and banishment would have followed, had it not been for tbe interference"], [306, "270 VENICE. of Giuseppe Alcaini, the gentleman at whose house Mrs. Billington lodged. This Signor Alcaini was father to the bishop and general of that name, and had been a famous man at the bar ; probably the only one who shone unrivalled at the forum Veneta for so long a period. It was his greatest ambition to entertain at his splendid house and sumptuous table, the prime donne of any celebrity, during the time of their performing at Venice. Mrs. Billington being a lively, pleasant woman, might have remained there as long as she chose ; but, as her French maitre de magasin was obliged to leave it, she thought proper to go with him to Treviso, where she purchased a country-house of the patrician Giovanni Veronese, at San Artien. No sooner was she settled in it, than Filisan began repairing the old house, from top to bot tom ;. and, for fear his spouse should decamp, as her brother and her cousin Sarah had done, he always forced her to accompany him, in an open cart, to buy planks, and bricks, and mortar, and sand, and every other material necessary for building. He obliged her to wear the coarsest garments, and never suffered her to put on a gown that cost more than two or three Venetian livres a yard. At their meals no cloth was ever put on the table ; and, instead of using a knife"], [307, "VENICE. 271 and fork, he would tear a fowl or a duck in pieces with his filthy fingers. The house in which they lived adjoined that of the patrician Cornaro, which, by means of an hydraulic machine, is surrounded with water as pure as crystal. One day, in his passion, the savage got hold of his wife, and swore he would drown her, unless she surrendered to him her jewels. To save her life, the unfortunate songstress com plied ; but never after were they returned to her. At last, beholding the horrible condition to which she was reduced by the brutal conduct of her husband, she one evening took French leave, almost en chemise, joined her brother at Venice, and set off with him for England. Here she met with that reception as a singer which her great talents entitled her to ; and hither her wretch of a husband had the audacity to follow her : but, as she was constantly under the protection of some cher ami or other, the first on the list being then the Duke of P , a minister of state ; as soon as Filisan presented himself at the theatre, as the husband of Mrs. Billington, for the purpose of receiving her salary, which was all he wanted, she had him instantly arrested ; and he was afterwards, by order, as it is said, of the above-mentioned"], [308, "272 VENICE. Duke, justly sent out of the country, by virtue of the alien act. Filisan returned to San Artien, vowing ven geance against England, and the whole English nation. Notwithstanding, however, all that Mrs. Billington had been made to suffer from this ruffian, and her knowledge that he was living with women of his own stamp, she often sent him money and presents from England ; and, after a separation of fifteen years, actually went back to him ! \" Frailty, thy name is woman !\" The ex cuse which she gave to an English lady, for her folly in returning to such a monster, was her fear, that she might become the victim of her princely paramour, as a great comic actress of the day was reported to have been. To save what she had collected together from the grasp of her regal favourite, she wrote to her husband to come to England to fetch her. He assented ; on condition that she made over to him every thing she possessed. This being complied with, Filisan re-visited this country under more fa vourable auspices than he had before done, and Mrs.Billington returned with him to Italy, taking with her a natural daughter, whom it is said she had had by an Englishman of the name of Mad-"], [309, "273 V E N I C E. docks. She had not been long at San Artien before her ruffian of a husband began his fistic operations upon her, and, on one of these oc casions, so severe were the bruises she re ceived, that from that day she took to her bed, and never rose from it alive ! Having thus got rid of his wife, Filisan's next step was to send the girl who went by the name of Maddocks to a convent, from a notion which had got into his head, that she was a child that Mrs. Billington had had by the philanthropic Duke of Sussex, and that if he could contrive to marry her himself, he stood a chance of get ting a good fortune with her. In which golden dreams, however, he was, luckily for the object of them, foiled, by some individuals in Eng land writing to the government, and getting the young lady, through the agency of the physician Aglietti, released from the convent and sent over to this country.

From that time, I never saw Madame Le Clere, except accidentally on my return from Spain, in my way to Italy, when I again met her at Marseilles, where she had just arrived, with the body of her husband, who had died at St. Domingo ; and sometime afterwards at Rome, when she had become the Princess Borghese. But she was then so much altered, as scarcely to be recognized ; for, at the time of"], [313, "277 V E N I C E. her marriage to her first husband, she was really a most beautiful woman. As I have mentioned the sumptuous dejeune given by Buonaparte at the palace Serbelloni, on the marriage of his sister, I shall here take occasion to express the astonishment I have often felt, that this Corsican family should have been so uncommonly extravagant, seeing that not a soul of them had ever before been in affluent circumstances. At the Hotel di Belvidere, where I resided, I found that one of the waiters had been ser vant to Buonaparte, during the siege of Tou lon, when his propitious star first shone upon his early exploits. At that time, he was so exces sively poor and friendless, that he and his man often could not scrape together a sum suffi ciently large to allow them to engage any other conveyance, from Marseilles to Toulon, than a single horse between them, and fre quently they were obliged to go on foot, for want of that useful commodity which is said to \" make the mare to go.\" This man also accompanied Buonaparte to Paris, and continued in his service until he embarked for Egypt. He declared to me, that he had often heard his master say, \" I must positively quit Paris and France for some little t3"], [314, "278 v i: \\ ice. time, or I sball meet with the fate that befel the Scipios : those two warriors were the greatest men Rome ever possessed : their sta tues were worshipped, and placed amongst those of their gods in the Pantheon, upon cushions ; but they lost all their popularity with the Romans, by appearing too often be fore them.\" To this policy it may be attri buted, that Buonaparte was induced to under take the command of that most extraordinary expedition. It was at the sumptuous deje&ne, given at the palazzo Serbelloni, on the occasion of the marriage of his sister Paulina to General Le Clere, that the violation of the Venetian ter ritory was determined on by Buonaparte. It was, however, necessary for him to proceed with every possible degree of caution, so as not openly to insult the hospitality of the Ve netians ; as the French army, at that time, were actually maintained by the very govern ment, whose destruction had been irrevocably fixed. To accomplish this destruction, Salicetti was directed to prepare some hundreds of peasants' dresses ; which dresses were distributed amongst the men andofficers; and underthis disguise were Bergamo and Brescia invaded, in concert with"], [315, "279 V E N I C E. the Lecchis and a few turbulent and disaffected characters, so as to make it appear to the go vernment at Venice, that the dismemberment of these two rich provinces had been the effect of a general and voluntary effort, on the part of the people, to get rid of their former mild government, and unite themselves with that of the Cisalpine. Remonstrance, on the part of the Venetian government, was useless, and of no weight in the scale of republican equity and justice. The die had been cast by Buonaparte. Those places were now to be separated for ever from the Venetian territory. On this occasion, the noble Alvise Quirini was sent ambassador extraordinary to Paris, to complain of this violation of their well-known neutrality and continued hospitality ; notwith standing the large sum advanced for the me diation of Barras with the other directors, for a further continuance of the Venetian neu trality and independence. On his arrival at his hotel, he found an order for him instantly to quit Paris, as Venice had, in the interim, been revolutionized ; though the sum of money to be paid, had been actually anticipated ; and the contributions levied by Buonaparte had been generally agreed to. t 4"], [316, "280 V E N I C E. In this state were the negociations, when Buonaparte- took possession of Verona, in open violation of all law, human and divine. And, what merit, I ask, could attach to a general, or to his army, for acting thus towards a friendly power, unprepared for resistance, ex cept in the affections of its subjects, in an open country, against an unarmed population, and an unfortified city ; whose inhabitants were cruelly plundered and massacred ? Many of the poor defenceless people of Verona were barbarously executed by the dastardly French, on their becoming masters of the Ve netian states ; but, the noble resistance which they made sufficiently demonstrates, that their affection and love for their legitimate govern ment, would have proved a powerful barrier against French aggression, had they been sup plied with arms. But, from the fatal want of them, they were brutally butchered and treated as rebels, for having defended themselves, to the best of their power, against the invasion of a foreign enemy, who was indebted millions to the Venetian government, and whose armies must have perished, but for the supplies which that government had generously afforded them ! Such members of the Venetian government as had not time, or were not disposed, to aban-"], [317, "V E N I C E. 281 don their situations and the trust reposed in them, by quitting Verona for Venice, were seized as hostages for the due fulfilment of the contract negociated at Paris ; though the go vernment no longer existed. Many persons at Verona were tried by a military court martial and shot. Amongst others, was my most par ticular friend Count Augustin Verita, who left behind him a young and beloved wife and child to deplore his melancholy fate. Ambassadors, commissioners, nobles, persons of all ranks and stations, were sent from Venice to Verona, and, vice versd, form Verona to Venice : but the Pacha Buonaparte was inexorable, and not to be diverted from his plan of general devastation ; and Venice, like the rest of Italy, was not to be exempt from the despotism of this unfeeling dictator! And, for all this accumulated affliction were the Venetians indebted to their own cre dulity, and to the hypocritical projects of the Corsican upstart ! The base pretence set up by Buonaparte for his hostility towards the Venetians, and for sacrile giously entering their territories, was, that the Veronese, headed by Count Augustin Verita, had inhumanly forced their way into the French hospitals, and had there massacred the sick and wounded of his army !"], [318, "282 V E N ICE. Now, had this even been the case, what right had he to make the whole nation, or its government, responsible for the act of an individual ? This, however, was not the case ; as has been proved, beyond the shadow of a doubt : it is, however, of a piece with all the foul deeds of treachery performed by Buonaparte for the overthrow of the Venetian government. The above-men tioned unheard-of calumny was the sheer in vention of his own brain. Not being able to discover traitors among the Venetians, he had recourse to this low and infamous subterfuge, in order to palliate his want of feeling for his own sick and wounded, who were dying every where like rotten sheep, for the want of medical assistance, and for lack of the common neces saries of life. For Buonaparte had little or no care for any of his men, when they could no longer be of service to him in the field of bat tle. He then most philosophically considered them an incumbrance, which it was desirable to get rid of. As \" dead men tell no tales,\" many a vile perpetrator of his foul orders has fallen a victim to his own misdeeds, to avoid discovery.

Besides, if the Venetian government h ad really wished to destroy the French armv, it would never, from mere motives of humanity, have maintained that army, for a considerable time, in the Terra Firma; since, by doing so, it ac tually committed a violation of its neutrality, as it regarded Austria. For at that time, from the depredations and plunderings of the French army, the people of the different provinces were so incensed against them, that they only wanted the word of command, for every man of them to have risen en masse. This I well remember, that in accompany ing some persons who were going to Milan, for the purpose of regulating the excise and customs duties, on passing through Bergamo and Brescia, we were surrounded by the whole population, who exclaimed to one of the pa tricians, who was with us in the carriage, \" What is the republic about ? what does the sluggish senate mean by all this inactivity ? are we to be sacrificed like sheep, and slaughtered by the French butchers ?\" But, alas, alas, instead of putting arms into their hands, and animating them to a general"], [320, "284 V E N 1 C B. defence of the state, they were exhorted to act with the greatest prudence \u2014 least, forsooth, they should give General Buonaparte and his army cause to complain ! O, fallacious policy ! O, unwise forbearance ! Thus were the poor people lulled into a state of apathy, until the Corsican invader, discovering their inviolable attachment to their government, and tired of acting the hypocrite any longer, revolutionized both Bergamo and Brescia ! While these things were going on, the Ge noese were secretly enjoying the destruction of their ancient rivals, the Venetians ; never once recollecting the good old proverb \u2014 \" Ho die mihi, eras tibi.\" And here I must be al lowed to repeat, what I have before so strenu ously urged ; namely, that Italy would never have been conquered by the French or by the Austrians, if the whole of that country had been opposed to the enemy. The policy which has fatally prevailed, has been to keep the Ita lians constantly at variance amongst them selves ; and we well know, from the highest authority, that \" a house divided against itself cannot stand :\" but Buonaparte, by disguising his real intentions, and by professing the oppo site of that which he intended to perform, con trived to make them individually hate each"], [321, "V E N I (' K. 285 other ; and by so doing did he more completely throw Italy into a state of division, than any other conqueror had done. Alvise Quirini being returned from his em bassy to Paris, Buonaparte, in the month of June 1796, at a small hovel in the town of Mestre, directed, nay commanded, the im prisonment of the three Inquisitors of State ; and, as soon as his fiat had been obeyed, the sham democratic republic was installed in theii room. The respected names of Pisani, of Dolfin, of Cornaro, of Ferro, and of Mocenego, were dishonoured, degraded, polluted, by the infamous wretches with whom they were now associated ! But, all the men of birth, of rank, and of probity, who, from their bond fide love of reform, had unfortunately been led astray from the path of duty, were soon convinced, that such an olio spagnuolo could not long con tinue ; and many of them declined the honour of serving their country, in company with the rebels who had been chosen by Buonaparte. But, here follows another Corsican stratagem, more atrocious, if possible, than all the rest. Will it be credited, that, during the whole of this time, Buonaparte had been negociating the sale of the Venetian States to Austria? for whilst the man\u0153uvres, and the murders, and"], [322, "286 VENICE. the butcherings, were committing at Vero na, that ginger-bread compact, the peace of Campo Formio took place, in the course of which the above states were actually bargained away ! The comedy of errors was, however, still kept up in all its scenes ; until at last the curtain dropped, and convinced the Venetians, as well as all Italy, that they had been perform ing the prominent parts of folly and of imbe cility, which distinguished the sad tragedy. Though Buonaparte at first insisted, that per sons taken out of the lowest class should form the major portion in the new mock-government, he, nevertheless, when it was proposed that some of these mushroom members of his own creation should be sent to him at Campo For mio \u2014 (for he still kept up the farce of making the Venetian democrats believe that he was treating for their independence, though Austria had concluded the contract, whereby she was to receive the Venetian States as a compensa tion for the Low Countries)\u2014 he rejected the rebel deputies with disdain, as he no longer stood in need of their assistance, and insisted, that two noble Venetians, as had been the cus tom, thould be sent thither, with Lavezzari, the secretary of the late senate, at their head ; who had, for many years, been the resident"], [323, "287 V E N I C E. minister of the republic, at the Court of London. It is to the said Lavezzari, between whom and myself there existed a long and uninter rupted friendship, that I am indebted for many of the anecdotes recorded in the present work. My friend had Strongly disapproved of the impolitic conduct of his government, in re fusing the generous offer of England, made in the year 1793, and repeated on the first invasion of the Italian territory by the French, of supplying the republic with men, with money, and with ships, for the purpose of protecting the Adriatic. But, all the argu ments he could make use of, founded on deep knowledge acquired by a long and skilful diplo matic career, were over- ruled by Bataja and Francesco Pesaro. Buonaparte, however, never had the courage to come to Venice, until after he had been dubbed \" Imperatore.\" Shortly after he as sumed that title, he added thereto that of \" Altissimo,\" which gave rise to the following jeu d'esprit on the two emperors \u2014 \" L'Altissimo di sii ci manda la tempesta, L Altissimo digiu cimangia quai che resta Fra questi due Altusimi Noi rcstiamo poverissimi !'"], [324, "288 V E N I C E.

As soon as the government had been suffi ciently democratized, Madame Josephine Buo naparte made her appearance at Venice, in the place of her lord and master, attended by all the revolutionary demireps of her party.

The sight of what was going on occasioned a deep national sensation ; and, if there had been at that precise moment, any manly spirit ready VOL. I. v"], [326, "290 V E N I C E. to head the populace, a revolt would inevitably have taken place. But their once leading men had been deprived of their property ; and with that property had fled their former manly spirit of resistance. So true is it, that \" L'uomo senza pecunia e l'immagine della morte.\" The people, therefore, made a merit of necessity, and suffered the French to proceed unmolested in the work of taking down these invaluable ornaments of their once famous city. No Ve netian labourer could, however, be found to assist them in the work of national robbery ; and the whole populace attended the embarka tion of the four steeds, as they would have at tended the body of a revered friend to the grave. Had St. Mark's Place and the great tower been moveable, the French would have carried them off, amidst the cries of \" Viva la liberta et l'egualianza ; chi non ruba non impiegnisce la panza.\" In the Terra Firma, they plun dered the several Monte di Pieta ; which were establishments similar to our pawnbrokers' shops ; and thereby was occasioned the ruin of thousands of honest and respectable fa mUies. From Venice Madame Josephine and her precious train of democratical trollops passed"], [327, "291 V E N I C E. to the Terra Firma, where they made it a con stant practice, as they had before done at Ve nice, to take every thing they had an inclina tion to, without paying for it. They never waited for an invitation, but visited wherever they pleased. Amongst the rest, Merini, the Bishop of Treviso, was obliged to entertain them at dinner ; in the course of which the old man caught a horrid fit of the gout in his hand, from a cold occasioned by the loss of a large, beautiful, and valuable ring, which Josephine had thought proper to take from his fingers; but which, unfortunately, she forgot to return. The poor bishop had but slender hopes of being made a cardinal ; for at that time the title was out of fashion, and he died before the religious farce was brought upon the political boards. Upon the above occasion, the Vene tians were accustomed to observe, \" I Fran cesi fanni molto uso del verbo avere, ma quello del verbo dare non hanno nel loro vocabu lario.\" Wlien Buonaparte and the French army en tered Bologna, Mrs. Billington happened to be singing at the opera ; and, so terrified was she, that she refused to perform. Upon hear ing this, the Hero of Italy ordered her to come to him in his box, and he there assured u 2"], [328, "292 v E n r c e. her, she had nothing to fear from him, as he \" never was at war with the fair sex.\" He nevertheless thought proper to arrest Mrs. Watson, the English Consul's wife, and had her dragged about, from place to place, for eight years, as a prisoner of war. He treated Mrs. Spencer Smith in the same manner, as well as another English lady at Venice. The former was arrested, by Buonaparte's order, immediately on the French coming to Venice ; the other two, while he was in Russia. One of them had resided in Venice twenty years, and was married to a Venetian. In short, the whole life of this man was a continued series of contradictions ; but the greatest of all was, perhaps, the surrendering himself up to the English, whom he absolutely detested, and whom he had always described as a nation of pirates \u2014 \" Cette nation doit etre ecrasee,\" was an expression he was accustomed to make use of, whenever the great man happened to be thwarted by the British government, in any ofhis \" grandes pensees.\" I have mentioned Madame Cecilia Tron, as being the only Venetian noble lady, who paid Josephine any particular attention. Her reason for . so doing was briefly this : she had at the time a lover of the name of Zorzi Richi, a"], [329, "293 VENICE. Greek and a native of Corfu, whom she after wards married. For this animal, who was the ne plus ultra of a Jacobin, Cecilia was extremely anxious to procure some appointment under the new government, and on this account was she induced to pay court to this female fox under the garb of a lamb. Nor was Cecilia unsuc cessful in her application to the Cisalpin rege neratrice, for Zorzi, sure enough, became one ofthe nouveaux employes; and, rather than have his name left out of the list, the brute would submit to have been made a night-man ; for M charity begins at home,\" was Zorzi's favourite motto ; and he had moreover a prodigious attach ment to the Agrarian law with regard to pro perty, in the expectation of securing a few acres for himself. But, in the midst of the democratical exhibi tions which Cecilia Tron gave at her palace on the Grand Canal, she could not, I think, help sometimes comparing her then situation, with the honours which she had once received from the hands of the Emperor, Joseph the Second, and contrasting the manners and habits of her then raggamuffin guests, with those of the distinguished individuals who formerly attended .her delightful parties, at the times when that u 3"], [330, "294 VENICE. monarch, whose letters she was accustomed so highly to extol, visited her, during his stay at Venice. And never, surely, was there suchan \"in dependent \" government, as the republican one, which Buonaparte, in his loving kindness, had carved out for the poor Cisalpins ! At the head of all their public decrees, in large letters, stood these words : \" For the honour and inde pendence of the infant Cisalpin Republic, the affectionate and loving Republic of France, orders and commands,\" &c. &c. I can never think of the conduct of Buona parte towards the people of Italy, but it re minds me of the sort of \" independence\" which he promised to father and son, when the un happy differences broke out between Charles the Fourth and his hopeful boy, the present right dearly \" beloved \" Ferdinand of Spain. Woe to that sovereign, to that family, or to that nation, who shall submit to have their private, or their public, differences settled by a foreigner! By so doing, they forfeit every claim to domes tic tranquillity, and bid a lasting adieu to that mutual confidence, which, when once destroyed, can never be restored ; and produce that precise state of things, which must either terminate in"], [331, "VENICE. 295 the triumph of one of the parties, or in both of them becoming the slaves of a foreign inter ference. Thus was it with the above individuals, when Buonaparte seduced father and son to quit their own dominions. Finding both of them to be in the wrong, from their inability to do that which was right, he cunningly contrived to make them both equally culpable, and both equally unworthy of reigning, when those wise acres of princes called him in to be the umpire in their disputes; and when, for the \"honour and the independence \" of Spain, as he had before done for the \" honour and the independence \" ofthe Cisalpins, he had \" ordered\" and \" com manded \" father, mother, son, brother, and lover to relinquish their authority \u2014 a command, which they never would have been forced to obey, had they been as much united for the public good, as they were divided in their se veral views. By an overwhelming stretch of power, a nation may, for a while, be conquered ; but never can it be subdued, without the entire extermination of its inhabitants \u2014 in wliich case, it would not be worth possessing. But the people of Spain, I venture to assert \u2014 and I do it after much reflection and considera tion \u2014 are at least a century behind the rest of u 4"], [332, "296 VENICE. the natives of Europe, in point of civilization. They are neither so rich, nor so valiant, nor so generous, as people have imagined them to be. A bigotry which borders more on idolatry than it does on religion ; and a superstition which is the offspring of gross, and palpable, and almost tangible ignorance, must, and ever will, have the inevitable effect of retarding the general improvement of the human species. To apply this to the present state of Spain. If we take a sober and impartial review of their recent conduct, we shall find them to be a race of mortals, differing from every other nation ; and especially that portion of them which be long to the old stock of Grandees. To me they appear to be the very outcasts of human manufactory : they seem to have been formed in a different mould from that of the rest of their fellow creatures. I scarcely ever recollect see ing one of them, who was not marked in the countenance like the Pharisee who grave our Saviour the sacrilegious slap ; who was not hunch-backed, or had crooked or ricketty legs ; or who had not an immensely large squat body, with a little round head tottering on a short neck ; like the Chinese figures which one sees at all the tea-shops nodding for customers, or the figure of punch running upon rollers."], [333, "VENICE. 297 Of all people on earth, ' the Spaniards are the most lazy, the most lousy, the most filthy, the most ignorant, the most savage, the most cruel, and the most implacable in their hatred towards all other nations; but especially towards the French, for whom they have an unconquer able, a deadly, aversion, and whose language is even less known amongst them, than it is in any village in Russia. On the arrival in Spain of the Crown Prince of Naples, with the princess his sister \u2014 who was the first wife of the present king, and whose sister was destined to be the wife of the said prince of Naples \u2014 when they alighted at Barce lona, at the palace prepared for their reception, they had more than half an hour to wait, before they could procure a glass of water ; for there was not a servant who understood French, Italian, German, or English. Nearly the same thing took place with the ladies who were about to be presented to the Queen of Charles the Fourth. They were intro duced to an old, squat, punchy figure, with her head nodding backwards and forwards, dressed in a hoop-petticoat, much wider than the little body was long, with ruffles at her elbows reach ing down to her high-heeled shoes ; on her head was a wide cap, covered with lace, a foot and"], [334, "298 VENICE. a half higher than her toupee, which was combed smooth over a black roller ; and, added to the whole, was a complexion more resembling a rotten olive, or fried oil, than the human skin. All we could get out of this \" model of divine perfection,\" was \" Nada, nada ; non intendo auste :\" and, if it had not been for one of the foreign ambassadors, who conducted us to the ambassador of the country to which we respec tively belonged, old \" Nada \" would have \" nada'd \" us till the day of resurrection ; and when the Queen told her our business for the next presentation to the princess, she turned round like a whipping top, laughed like a Che rokee, and shewed her teeth like a monkey ; which said teeth, one in and one out, resembled, for all the world, the old rusty bars of a prison. There was not a single carriage belonging to the royal family, that had any other harness than ropes ; excepting one, which belonged to the Queen, and a chariot, which was the pro perty of the then all-powerful and infamous Godoi, the Prince of Peace ; whose anti-chamber for reception of the Grandees was at the head of the stair-case ; and when he saw me he politely conducted me by the hand to the pre sence chamber of his levee; and as politely shut the door in their faces. He neither spoke,"], [335, "VENICE. 299 nor understood, any tongue except Spanish. Of course, my conversation with him was of a very limited nature, as I was but scantily ac quainted with the idiom of that language ; but Massaredo and Gravina were kind enough to explain to me the Prince's civilities. In short, I quitted Spain with less regret than I ever quitted any country in Europe ; since it had no post, but on horseback ; no high roads but from one part of France. The arts and sciences were neglected ; very little trade was going on ; no agriculture but of the most ordi nary kind was encouraged ; few manufactories ; and the whole country had nothing to recom mend it, but its fine sky and its fruitful but scandalously-neglected soil. In Spain, there are no public inns but such as are fit for Spaniards to enter ; and no provisions are to be procured in any of them, except those on the road from Perpignan to Barcelona, and on the roads towards Madrid, and the Estremadu ras. When a traveller arrives at one of these inns, and asks the landlord what he has to give his visitors for dinner, the fellow will answer, laconically, \" nada ;\" that is to say, nothing. If, therefore, you happen to be on a road, at a distance from any town or village, and have not had the precaution to take a supply with you,"], [336, "300 V E N I C E. you must go without.

Napoleon, after his coronation, thought for the first time, of visiting his Italian slaves, and determined to include Venice in the general tour. Orders were accordingly sent round to all the civil magistrates, to meet him within the limits of their several governments. The prefects, as the heads of the different departments, with the sub-prefects, and their ladies, were all directed to appear en grand train. Milan was no longer the fashion, and Venice was become \" ma bonne ville.\" Vicenza was to be the rendezvous of the pre fects and sub-preftcts. The famous Olympic Theatre, built by the immortal Palladio, and to light up which requires no less than a but of oil, attracted the notice ofthe \" altissimo impe ratore.\" Observing which, the magistrate took the liberty of informing the mighty man, that from its dilapidated and neglected state, they were fearful they should shortly be deprived of this grand national monument. No sooner did he hear this, than, turning round and calling to his adopted son \u2014 for no mortal was allowed to approach the person of the \" altissimo \" un called for \u2014 he said, \" I authorize you, Eugene, to present the commissioners of the Olympic with a hundred thousand livres.\" And, that the admiring spectators might be struck with his"], [339, "VENICE. 303 munificence, this direction was given in an audible tone of voice. The prince bowed as sent ; but the money for the repairs was never forthcoming ; and this beautiful specimen of ar chitectural skill continues in the same dilapi dated condition to this day. As Buonaparte had always a list of the pre fects and sub-prefects of the departments he was about to visit, he singled out such to con verse with as were of noble birth. Seeing amongst them the name of the Marquis Anto nio Solari \u2014 who was then governor of the Sibe rians of Italy, in the mountains called the Sette Communi, and in a small village of which, called La Mara, some of the inhabitants had oppo sed themselves to the unusual taxation, and had shot several excise officers who had come to enforce the payment of the same \u2014 Buona parte said to him, \" Marquis Solari, when you return to Asiago \u2014 \" (the name of the capital of the Sette Communi) \u2014 \" tell the people they must submit to be placed on the same footing with the rest of my subjects, and that if they again rebel, I will certainly exterminate them.\" The Marquis replied \u2014 \" I hope your Majesty wdl not confound a populace of nearly forty thousand peaceable souls, with a few misguided individuals.\""], [340, "304 V E N I C E. \" But I will be obeyed,\" continued Buo naparte ; \" my laws shall be executed, and my officers shall remain unmolested. Tell them, Sir, that I have long arms, and can at any time reach them.\" The Marquis Solari replied, \" I hope your Majesty will dispense with my so doing, since all Europe, I believe, is well convinced of the length of those arms.\" Buonaparte being rather pleased with this reply, began to take snuff by wholesale ; and then, addressing the Marquis, he said, \" I think I have seen you before?\" \u2014 \" Yes, please your Majesty,\" answered Solari, \" at Milan, in consequence of an application to your Majesty, for the restoration of two carriages of which I had been robbed, and also at the marriage of the Princess Borghese with General Le Clere, at my friend's the Duke di Serbelloni's, where your Majesty was pleased to invite me to the public breakfast.\" \" O, yes, yes,\" replied Buonaparte, \" I remember.\" On leaving the Marquis to speak to another person, he said laughingly, \" So, Marquis Solari, you think the people of the Sette Communi know the length of my arm ?\" This conversation took place at Vicenza ; from which place Buonaparte set off for Ve-"], [341, "305 VENICE. nice. But the good people of that city, having, for centuries, been in the habit of seeing most of the sovereigns of Europe, were by no means struck with astonishment at his much vaunted abilities; and he lost, at that place, much of his celebrity, on their becoming personally acquainted with him : for he confined his con versation to simple interrogatories ; therein imitating those princes who, being deficient in logical powers, aim at being understood by a vacant smile, a shake of the head, or a shrug of the shoulders ; and who find it easier to listen to what is said to them, than give thereto an appropriate off-hand reply. When Buonaparte visited the Casinos of the noble ladies, his conversation was extremely limited. \" What's your name ? Whereabouts do you live ? When do you go to the Terra Firma ? Have you ever been to Paris ? Are you married ? How many children have you ? Who is your husband ?\" One lady told him, she had been married several years, but had had no children. \" Then kick your husband out of bed,\" was his reply. However, he fixed his attention on one of the most aukward and mal adroit ladies of the whole company, who had no earthly quahty to recommend her, excepting her youth ; invited her to dine with him on the fol- vol. i x"], [342, "306 VENICE. lowing day ; and appointed her one of the ladies of honour to the Empress ; as he did also the ladies Catherine Micchielli Pisani, Lucy Mo cenigo, Elizabeth Damula, Marietta Quirini, &c. ; but, as there was at that time no Empress in Italy, these poor females were under the necessity of trotting all the way to Milan, to perform their noble office, near the person ofthe Vice-queen, the wife of Prince Eugene, with an appointment of four hundred livres a year. These ladies of honour, however, used to afford the vice-queen no small amusement, when at Monza ; where the Prince Eugene, her husband, was wont to employ his leisure hours in making them good christians, by ducking them from head to heels \u2014 to the no small diver sion of her suite, and the mortification of the aforesaid dames d'honneur. However, it was one way of being soused into favour ; for one and all of them were fortunate enough to pro cure good situations for their husbands ; nor could it be attributed to any improper secret influence, since all the ladies, excepting one, bore unimpeachable characters. The Princess of Bavaria, the vice-queen, was certainly a very virtuous and amiable woman ; but, so totally a slave was she to the tyrannical etiquette of Buonaparte's court, that she dared not to interfere in behalf of any individual ; nor"], [343, "VENICE. 307 was it ever known that she acted illiberally. When commanded by Buonaparte, she would make a present to her ladies of a French silk gown, a shawl, a necklace, or a pair of ear rings, as a compensation for those which the prince her husband had seized, to keep them in good-humour. When the Empress Josephine was at Milan, the vice-queen scarcely ever showed herself; as she could not brook the idea of giving up her rank by birth, toa newly created Empress of yesterday. A similar feeling she also discovered at the time of Napoleon's coronation. When the Queens of Spain, Naples, and Holland, were the train bearers to Josephine, she refused to go in the procession, anchabsented herself, under pretence of sudden illness ; and, from motives of pru dence, she kept her room, while most of the grand fetes were going on, upon that occasion. On the birth of Prince Eugene's first daugh ter, Napoleon created her Princess of Bologna, and the city of that name was graciously charged with the cost of her establishment and education. This, however, was a mere trifle, considering the high honour that was conferred on them ! And, truly, what were a few millions to an inland town like Bologna ! Buonaparte was certainly one of the best cal- x 2"], [344, "308 VENICE. culators in the universe ; for he never speculated without a reason. His honours were always let out to interest. He would often talk of his long arms ; but, if he had added thereto his long sight, in accomplishing every object\u2014 up to a certain point \u2014 that presented itself to his view, he certainly would not have overrated the degree to wliich he possessed this extraordinary faculty. Asi have more than once mentioned the share which the well-known Barras had in the overthrow of the Venetian republic, I think I cannot do better than introduce into this chapter, an anec dote or two respecting this extraordinary man. During my visit to Brussels, in the year 1803, Barras was living in that city in very good style. Hearing of my arrival, he paid us a visit at the Hotel de Bellevue, and gave us a general invi tation to his table, during our stay. It was during one of these visits, that the sale to Moreau of Grosbois, which had been the pro perty of the present King of France, and had been presented to Barras by the National As sembly, whde he was one of the Directory, took place. He would frequently say to us, when speak ing of Buonaparte, \" vous verrez, mes amis, qu'il ne mourira pas tranquille a Paris.\""], [345, "309 VENICE. He had a female with him, whom he intro duced to us as one of his aid-de-camps, and who was constantly en habit d' homme. At Brussels, he was always called General Barras, and was not allowed to be visited by, or to receive visits from, the inhabitants. Penticulon, the then prefect of that city, kept a watchful eye on the exile. At the time of my stay there, another noble Venetian beside my husband, was lodging at our hotel, to whom Barras made himself known ; as he did, indeed, to all tra vellers. This nobleman we one day met at Barras's house, when the following curious conversation relative to the Venetian Ambassa dor, Alvise Quirini Stampatello, and the vio lation of that republic, (for the protection of which Barras had received a very considerable douceur,) took place. By the bye, the Abbe Fortis, who was at Paris, while Quirini was treating for the neutrality of Venice, used to say, that he had not been sufficiently liberal to Barras's subalterns ; who, in consequence, marred the intention of their master. Be that as it may, Barras con fessed to us, that the Five Directors were only the executioners of the peremptory will of the great Buonaparte, and that Alvise Quirini, in x3"], [346, "310 VENICE. his mode of negociating the transaction, had discovered himself to be a mere blockhead. \" I believe,\" said the Venetian nobleman, in reply to this observation, \" it would have been a very difficult task to have found an honest man capable of treating, on equal terms, with the corrupt government which then existed in France.\" \" There,\" replied Barras, \" is the grand error into which so many people have fallen. Nothing was further from the intention of the civil go vernment in France, than to make territorial conquests, or to stir up the governments of other countries against our own. It was all owing to the army, and to the ungovernable ambition of that Jean-F Buonaparte; and which ambi tion will never cease but with his life, and ultimately be his overthrow. \" After Buonaparte had made himself master of Italy (which, I confess, to my bitter regret, was my own fault), the civil government of France had no influence whatever, but was wholly dependant on the military ; who, from a sentiment of blind enthusiasm, were subservient to Buonaparte. \" I was the most strenuous advocate for a general peace ; and, above all, for a peace with England. Had she acceded to that peace, and"], [347, "311 VENICE. had not the Directory been betrayed, Buonaparte would never have been able, in an underhand way, to have made himself Dictator, to the destruc tion of the best interests of France : for all his conquests have only served to rob her of men and of money. He squandered the treasures of France and of Italy upon two hundred thousand men, who thus had the means of corrupting millions. This, I assure you, is the real state ofthe case. i' There were three things which Buona parte was suffered to commit with impunity, any one of which would have cost the life of any other man. His conduct towards Kleber in Egypt; his cruelty towards his prisoners ; and his coming from Egypt to Paris without performing qua rantine, and there upsetting the government ; were all offences, for which he was on the point of being declared hors de la loi. He, however, triumphed over all of them, and has completed his ingratitude by banishing me, his first friend and liberal benefactor ! \" The way, too, in which all his operations have hitherto been seconded by his good fortune, is altogether astonishing. How long it will last it is impossible for me to say ; but I think I may venture to assert, that the impetuosity ofhis cha racter will shortly carry him out of his depth. Had he governed the French with the precau- x 4"], [348, "312 VENICE. tionary mildness of the Directory, he would long ago have been buried in the dust. Happy would it have been for Europe, if he had never arrived at his present giddy elevation ! But he rules his subjects with a rod of iron ; and France, intoxicated with her gigantic conquests\u2014con quests which she can only retain as long as the fanaticism which has blinded her to her real in terest shall continue \u2014 must, sooner or later, submit to another revolution, before Europe can be restored to its just equilibrium.\" All this was uttered by Barras with an energy that gave to his words the conviction of truth. He was remarkably animated while he was speaking ; and, so anxious were we to hear him justify himself on many points that had been laid to his charge, that we never interrupted him, except when he happened to appeal to us for our opinion. I shall here relate another curious circum stance, which took place at a dinner at the Hague, where, by accident, we met with Marshal Augereau, the Duke de Castiglione. In the beginning of the French revolution, Augereau was a common soldier in one of the Neapolitan regiments; from which, through the interest of the French ambassador, Perregou, he had been discharged, and had been taken, by"], [349, "313 VENICE. that gentleman, into his house, in the capacity of fencing-master to his children. Wishing to figure away in the revolution, Augereau pre vailed on the ambassador to give him letters of introduction to the principal cities in his route to France, that he might defray the expenses of his journey by giving lessons to academies. Being acquainted with Busienello, the Venetian ambassador at Naples, he procured a letter from him to my husband at Venice ; who was a great proficient in the said art, and one of the best swordsmen in all Italy. When we were at the Hague, on entering one day the house of a gentleman, with whom we were to dine, he introduced us, by name, to Augereau. His Venetian acquaintance knew the general immediately ; but, not wishing to hurt his feelings, my husband did not remind him of their former acquaintance at Venice. However, being seated opposite each other at table, Au gereau said to him \u2014 \" Good God ! I did not at first recollect you. How happy am I to see you again ! Don't you recollect going round, at the academy, with your silver plate, to col lect the money for me, from the friends whom you were good enough to interest in my behalf at Venice ? Come, come, Sir, don't be ashamed of having done a good action. I have not for-"], [350, "314 VENICE. got it, I assure you ; and, while you are in this country, I hope you and your better half will favour me with your company at my residence.\" Count Zenobio was also one of the party. We could not, however, avail ourselves of his hospitality, as we had a prior engagement ; but we frequently met in the evening at Augereau' s. Venice was often thesubjectof our conversation. When we were one day talking of Buonaparte's unprincipled sale of that republic to Austria, \" Ma foi,\" said Augereau, \" ce coquin nous a tout trompe! In saving him, the French republic upset itself. Had the Directory but ordered him to be shot on his landing from Egypt, it would have immortalized itself; but it was an unwieldy body, without a head ; and that was the reason why Sieyes would notbecome one of them. I foresee we shall return to what we were ; if we do not, indeed, sink into some thing worse ! Buonaparte has deceived us all ; and, though he has forgotten the hospitality of the Venetian Republic towards the French, I shall ever feel grateful for the civilities I once received from one of its subjects. Your sorrow at beholding the degraded state of your once happy country does infinite honour, both to your head and your heart.\" I record this anecdote, for the purpose of"], [351, "VENICE. 315 doing justice to the memory of Augereau: as it evinces feelings, which are but too seldom to be met with in those who have risen above their primitive condition in life.

I concluded the last chapter, with an ac count of my interviews, with Barras and with Augereau. I shall commence the present, with an anecdote which was related to me by ano ther of Buonaparte's generals."], [352, "316 VENICE. In the course of my conversations with Gene ral Menou, whilst he was governor of Venice, he more than once assured me, that of all Buonaparte's lunatic projects, the notion of invading England, and the idea of seducing Russia, while he was in Egypt, to co-operate with him in the conquest of India, were by far the most preposterous, and the least likely to be accomplished. Menou said, that Buonaparte had been more indebted to the folly of Nelson, in suffering him to get to Egypt, and to the British cruizers in allowing him to land, on his return therefrom, than to any thing that the French nation had done for him ; for that if, in both instances, the English fleet had done their duty, he never would have escaped. \" Your Rodney, and your Howe, and your Hood, would not,\" he would say, \" have been so complaisant to the French general.\" Indeed, that Buonaparte was never serious in his much boasted project of invading this coun try, may be gathered from the following facts, which took place during my stay at Paris, where I arrived shortly after Lord Nelson had attempted the bombardment of the port of Bou logne. A task, by the bye, of no very easy accomplishment ; first, on account of the town itself being beyond the reach of the ships of"], [353, "VENICE- 317 war; and, secondly, because no vessel drawing more than three or four feet water, can ever approach near enough for that purpose. However, the Hero of the Nile did every thing that skill and bravery could accomplish ; and the effects of his operations were pretty apparent, from the fact of the few gun-boats in that port, which had been prepared for the invasion of Old England, having been taken out of the water, and drawn upon dry land, and placed in a state of security, for fear of a second Nelsonian attack. At Paris, the success of the invasion of England was looked upon as a dead cer tainty. In their mind's eye, the badauds of \" ma bonne ville \" already fancied they beheld the Corsican making his triumphant entry into their capital, loaded with the treasures of the Bank of England, and followed by the machinery and the manufactures aud the other spoils, of this the modern Carthage \u2014 about to be destroyed ! Amongst the number of the duped, was the Venetian patrician Niccoletto Cornara, who ventured to lay a considerable bet, that, on a certain day, Buonaparte would set oft' on his march from Dover for London. From the experience I had had of the French General's"], [354, "318 VENICE. menacing character, and knowing that, though he had accomplished many great things, he had left still greater ones unaccomplished, I ven tured to take the bet ; and, the better to convince myself of the real state of things, I determined on setting off from Paris on a visit to the coast, where these weighty preparations were said to be in such a state of forwardness. My love of England, and my knowledge of the character of the brave inmates of her wooden walls, ambitious as I knew Buonaparte to be, would not allow me to give credit to the rumour, that he entertained a serious design of making the attempt ; more especially as I well knew that at that very moment, his attentions were directed to the secret movements of the cabinet of Vienna, and that he had just succeeded in getting into his possession a most important despatch, intended for the Austrian Ambas sador, Count Cobenzel ; and which despatch has, I believe, never been made public. But to proceed. Scarcely had I, with my husband, proceeded a few paces on the road to Boulogne, before we met a considerable num ber of troops, with ammunition waggons, re trograding from the field of action, and marching in a totally different direction. In consequence of his knowledge of the above-"], [355, "319 V E N I C E. mentioned treachery towards the Austrian am bassador, my husband, at seeing this, exclaimed, \" These troops are going to Vienna !\" We stopped our carriage, for the purpose of letting them pass, and interrogated some of them, as to whence they came, and whither they were going? They replied, that they had come from the ports of Boulogne and Calais ; that all the troops, after Nelson had paid them a visit at the former place, had been disbanded ; and that they believed they were going to semestre. We continued our journey to Boulogne ; and, on our arrival, we immediately went down to the port to see this second edition of the Spanish Armada, upon which Buonaparte had expended twelve millions of livres ; when we found the whole of it to consist of seventeen gunboats capable of carrying from thirty-five to forty men each, with two small field pieces ! This was the extent of the mighty force which had been put into requisition, and, which had kept John Bull in such a state of agitation ! The whole, too, as I have already observed, were safely drawn up on dry land. We dined at the table d'hote ; and, on our telling the story of our having come all the way from Paris to witness the embarkation,"], [356, "320 VENICE. we were heartily laughed at, for our pains. \" Ah !\" said one, \" you are not the only dupes by hundreds, who have been taking this wild goose journey.\" \" No, no,\" said another, \" the sea is not our element : the Pas de Calais is not Mount Cenis, where we wefe suffered to pass uninterruptedly ; nor is it the Bochetta at Genoa, where the Austrians, with a couple of pieces of cannon, might have destroyed the whole French Army ; nor is John Bull, or the English nation, like the divided people of Italy !\" We next proceeded to Calais, where we found, that all the preparations that had been made consisted of seven boats of the same con struction as those at Boulogne ; and not a single soldier more than was absolutely necessary to garrison the town. One thjjjg cannot be denied ; namely, that the English, notwithstanding their immense naval force, had little or no real and genuine intelligence, as to the movements of their neighbours. Had this not been the case, the threatened invasion never could have produced a thousandth part ofthe sensation on the minds of the good people of England which it is known to have done. For it is a fact but too well established, that, excepting the intelligence"], [357, "321 VENICE. which they procured from infamous hired spies, the British Government gave no credence to that which was afforded them by respectable private individuals, who were actuated solely by a love of their native country. To my own certain knowledge, many valuable hints were given to the British government, on the subject of the wood-cutting commission at Fiume, where the English had an exclusive contract. Notwithstanding which, her enemies were, all the time, felling, thick and thin, the forest in the Tyrole \u2014 Aye ! and in the teeth of the very commissioner Adamici, and the British consul at Fiume. In an early chapter of my work, I have cal led Buonaparte the \" Arch-drover of Italy ;\" and, that he is richly entitled to the appellation, the following facts will shew. Not that I wish to have it inferred, that he has not, per fas aut nefas, rendered numerous benefits to the French nation, and to the cause of liberty and of civi lization. It cannot, however, be denied, that he grossly deceived and betrayed the unfortu nate people of Italy. Previously to his coming to Venice, Buona parte stopped at Malghera. Here it was, that he decreed the dissolution of the aristocracy, or, more properly speaking, of the oligarchical re- VOL. I. y"], [358, "322 VENICE. public ; commanded the imprisonment of the three inquisitoridi stato, and installed, as he made the credulous people believe, pro tempore, the democratical government ; for he well knew, that an absolute monarchy and a plebeian de mocracy are equally vicious. That neither Napoleon, nor any one of his family, were democrats at heart, I think I have already shewn, and shall hereafter still further substantiate, out of their own mouths, and from documents which cannot be disproved, in my account of the exploits of the Buonaparte Fa mily in the Milanese territories. Antecedently to this revolution in the Venetian republic, a secret article \u2014 and a most atrocious one it was \u2014 had been entered into, at the peace of Campo Formio, between France and Austria, for the sale of the Venetians. Where, then, was the necessity for the democratizing of this govern ment ? And, when he had effected his purpose, why be ashamed of a democratrical representa tive ; which he refused to send to that congress, still further to make the credulous Venetians believe, that they might stipulate for their inde pendence when he had already sold them, by ordering one of the most distinguished of the Venetian nobility to be sent thither, as in former times, under the old decripit oligarchical authority which he so vehemently reprobated ?"], [359, "VENICE. 323 His express words, when Orazio Lavezzari wait ed on him in the Terra Ferma (for he never came to Venice untd years after), and asked him, \" who are we to send to treat at Campo Formio, \u2014 one of the new order ?\" were \" Bah, no, no, no ! non voglio nessuno di quella canaglia ; send a noble patrizio, and do you accompany him. You have been resident in England, have you not?\" \"Yes,\" said La vezzari. Previously to the institution of the municipal officers, Buonaparte ordered the list of names to be sent to him ; but many individuals of res pectability, who were supposed by him to be of the French party, merely in consequence of their having spoken freely as to the necessity of the republic changing its political system according to circumstances, and who had no wish for French interference, and much less for the total overthrow of the republican au thority, when they were called upon and asked whether they would become members of the municipality \u2014 one of them in particular declin ed, and, striking out his name, left Venice and retired to his country seat, for fear of being compelled to accept the office. This took place in the year 1796. In 1808, when Buonaparte was made King of Italy, this y 2"], [360, "324 VENICE. gentleman, the Marquis Antonio Covion Solari, was made vice-prefect. The first time Buona parte ever saw him, instantly recollecting the name, he said, \" Ah, Marquis ! I remember ; you declined being a member of the munici pality !\" Solari had nearly forgotten the circum stance, when Buonaparte repeated, \" Yes, yes ! you scratched out your name, though Cornaro, Dolfin, Pisani, and many other of your friends and acquaintances were among the number. Well, well, they are all dead, and you are alive. I suppose you had your reasons for refusing ; and I have mine for now appointing you to serve the office of prefect.\" It is a curious fact, that, in these matters, the memory of Buo naparte scarcely ever failed him. This gentleman, the Marquis di Solari, was appointed to the government in the mountains, called the Sette Communi, exclusively inhabited by the descendants of the Cimbri, who, being beaten and dispersed near Verona, by Marius, a hundred and one years before the Christian \u00e6ra, betook themselves to those mountains ; and, up to this very day, have preserved their ancient customs, as well as their ancient language, which a good deal resembles the Danish and the Low Dutch. The women and children, who have never quitted their Alpine situation, nei-"], [361, "325 VENICE. ther speak nor understand the Italian ; though the spot in which they live is only at the dis tance of about thirty miles from Vicenza. The men, who, during the winter months, are obliged to descend into the vallies, for the purpose of procuring food for their cattle, (every thing on the earth being frozen up for eight months out of the twelve,) speak the Venetian dialect. Together, they form a population of from six-and-thirty to forty thousand souls. For the most part, they are shepherds. The country they inhabit produces scarcely any thing in the mountainous parts, excepting a a little barley, and fire-wood. The small por tion of the country which is flat is planted with tobacco, which, since the revolution, they are obliged to sell to the government; whereas, before that period, the Venetian republic bene volently exempted these poor mountaineers from all kinds of public taxes, and, on account of the sterility of their soil, granted them, into the bargain, several very important privi leges ; deeming them sufficiently taxed al ready by nature, in the deprivation of the common necessaries of life ; such as bread and every kind of vegetables ; which articles they are obliged to fetch, either from Bassano, at a distance of fivc-and-twenty miles, or from y 3"], [362, "326 VENICE. Vicenza ; as they are more than two thousand feet above the level of the sea. Indeed, the spot is considered the very Sibe ria of Italy. The snow begins to fall in Sep tember ; and often continues on the ground until the month of May, and sometimes as late as June. To enable them to go to church or walk about, the shoes of the people are pre pared, in the same manner as those of the horses are, which have to travel over ice. In their manners and customs, they somewhat resemble the feudal slaves in Poland and Russia. In their houses, as well as in their persons, they are remarkably slovenly and dirty. There is only one house built of brick in the whole district ; and that house is situated in Asiago, the capital of the Sette Com muni. The rest are composed of mud and stones, and are thatched with rushes or straw. The cold is sometimes so intense, that the oil is laid in large lumps before the fire to dissolve, before it can be used. The wines and spirits are sure to be genuine ; for the watery particles freeze, and the pure spirit only remains. The in habitants are obliged to cook all their provisions with snow water. A small spring runs through the town of Asiago, but the people bathe, water their cattle, and empty their cloacas into it ;"], [363, "327 VENICE. which makes it useless for any particular pur pose ; so that the very salutary operation of washing can only be performed during the three or four summer months. The reason why the inhabitants are allowed the privilege of planting tobacco, which is in general prohibited by the Austrian and French authorities, is because it is so particu larly beneficial to the population ; as the little ploughable land which they possess, is, in a twelve-fold degree, more productive in this article, then it would be in any other grain, root, or seed ; and supplies them with the means of procuring money, wherewith to pur chase the first necessaries of life. They are, however, asi have just said, obliged to dispose of the whole of the said tobacco to the government. In fact, these people, when living under the Venetian government, formed a sort of inde pendent little republic ; and scraped together a livelihood, as much by smuggling, as by their Alpine industry. When the French became masters of Italy, these poor creatures were put on the same footing with the Corsican's other Italian subjects, and subjected to the general system of taxation ; as well as to that most terrible of all scourges, the conscription ! As I have before observed, the Marquis di y 4"], [364, "328 VE N 1 C E. Solari had the misfortune to be sent amongst these people, for the purpose of organizing the said system. As may naturally be imagined, some of the poor creatures resisted the new order of things, and at a small village, called La Mara, revolted, and refused to allow the con scription to take place. Being excellent marks men, theyfired on the authorities, and compelled them, for a time, to abandon the idea of recruit ing among them. Their own clergy and other of the inhabitants were selected by the French, to point out the youths who were qualified to be drawn. But being, like the Jews, all re lated to one another, by marriages and inter marriages, not a man of them would they give up ; and the authorities were obliged to desist, until they had procured from Vicenza a military force strong enough to protect the civil powers from being shot at. Besides, as these moun tains are within gun-shot of the Bavarian terri tories, to which the poor creatures fled when ever they were in dread of being punished, it was found prudent, even when the military had been called in to aid the civil authorities, to proceed with the greatest caution. In the mean time, the prefect Solari, who was a very humane and excellent man, went amongst them at the risk of his life, amidst a"], [365, "329 VENICE. volley of shot, and, expostulating with them on the consequence of their futile resistance, persuaded them to return to their duty ; kindly promising to use his best exertions with the head of the authorities at Milan, to get them exempted from the payment of several heavy taxes. When Buonaparte was crowned King of Italy, the Prefect Solari was obliged to repair to Milan, with the rest of the magistrates of the Bacchdlione ; and, though the above affair had taken place in 1796 or 1797, when the new monarch was only a general in the army, yet, when he again saw the Prefect of Asiago, in the year 1808, he immediately recollected the above circumstance, and talked over the whole matter with the Marquis. Speaking relatively, the inhabitants of Asiago, considering their situation, are in a state of ease ; and some few of them are rich both in lands and in cattle. They, however, live nearly in a state of nature. They are unac quainted with the use of table linen, and very few of the men wear collars to their shirts. Some of them, who had been educated at the University of Padua, and at other public se minaries, on their return to Asiago, endea voured to introduce amongst them the gratia-"], [366, "330 VENICE. tion between master and servant, so indis pensable in civilized society ; but they were obliged to relinquish the project, as none of them would stay with masters, who would not permit them to take their meals at the same time, and at the same table, as themselves. There never was an instance of an ox being killed in the whole Sette Communi. The only animal food consumed by them is that of sheep, very young calves, and goats. Their trade is in the above cattle, and in a few cows. They make very little butter, but save all the milk for the purpose of being made into cheese. Providence has bestowed on the people of the Sette Communi strong minds, and a large portion of natural genius. But, they are artful, cun ning, and revengeful. They have retained the broad-featured countenance of the northern nations, and have high cheek-bones, small eyes, and rather flattish noses. They are above the middle stature, and have large stout limbs. The women are rather of a masculine cast. They wait at table, and scarcely ever sit down to eat, until their husbands have finished their meals. In the beginning of September, such of the natives as are not mechanics quit the moun tains with their cattle, to find forage till the"], [367, "331 VENICE. month of May; when they again return to them. At one time, they were accustomed to make violent irruptions into the territories of the Venetians, wherever they could find pasture for their cattle ; but now they are under the ne cessity of paying for whatever they consume. During these months, the people of the Sette Communi resemble a nation of Amazonians ; for the men and boys are all absent, taking charge of their flocks. The country partakes much of the appearance of the barren Alpine mountains in Switzerland. Every thing in the shape of a carriage is drawn by mules ; as some of the passes will not admit the narrowest two-wheeled conveyance, and are, in the autumn, on ac count of the torrents that overflow the gravelly valleys, antj again in spring, when the snow and ice are thawing, altogether impassable. And such, indeed, was the precise situation of she Sette Communi, when the first prefect Solari took possession of his semi-barbarous situation. For nearly twenty days was he de tained, with sixty of these animals, men and beast, at the foot of the mountains near the Brenta, which run down to the Tirol, at a most uncomfortable village inn. And, when at last he arrived at Asiago, the house destined for him \u2014 which, as I have before said, was the"], [368, "332 VENICE. only one in the place built of brick, and which belonged to a M. Bonhomo, residing at Vi cenza \u2014 was so much out of repair, that the first night the worthy Prefect and his family slept in it, they were within an ace of being drowned in their beds, from the torrents of rain which fell into every apartment. And, in this state were they obliged to live, until a house could be buUt, suitable for the reception of the first magistrate ; but, at his own expense ! In the mean time, the government directed, that the house of M. Bonhomo should be made tenantable and water-proof; but, as these orders were not accompanied with that necessary in gredient l'argent, they were of no avail, and the prefect had no alternative, but either to live in the streets, or to defray the expense of the said repairs himself. Again : in consequence of the frost, no mortar could be used ; and therefore was the Marquis Solari obliged to build entirely with wood. So that, what with the expense of the building; what with the expense of the journey ; what with the damage done to his furniture ; and what with the quantity of china, glass, and earthen ware that was smashed into pieces \u2014 and for which, though promised, he was never indemnified \u2014 at the end of his prefectureship,"], [369, "VE N I C E. 333 the worthy Marquis of Solari, had the morti fication of finding himself some thousands of livres minus by his official appointment ! \" Ahi ! misero chi speme in mortal cose pone !\" The mud habitations, or rather the wretch ed huts or stables in which men, women, and children are all huddled together, are covered, as I before observed, with rushes. To make fast the extremity of these rushes, large planks, pro jecting about two feet into the streets, are attach ed ; which planks not only serve to carry off the water, but act as a shelter from the rain to walk under. The fire-place is in the middle of the apartment ; and, as the houses have no chim neys, the smoke collects, of course, on the walls and ceilings, which are as black as coal pits : consequently, the water that falls from the projecting boards is as black as ink. The clerk of the prefecture being one day sud denly caught in the rain, took shelter under one of these boards ; and, not being aware of the internal construction of the habitation, he re turned home in the utmost amazement ; de claring, that, though he had been a great travel ler, he had never before been in a country, where it rained ink ; for the drops that had fallen had actually died his coat and his inexpressibles, of"], [370, "334 VENICE. a jet, as profound as is the Blacking of Mr. Turner, of Mr. Warren, of Mr. Martin, or of any of those shining characters, the nigrescent qualities of whose respective wares are chaunted in lofty verse, and are so strikingly proclaimed, in chalk, and in words really and truly sesqui- pedalian, on all the walls of all our highways and byways : and, for resorting to which mode of obtaining celebrity, they, individually and collectively, deserve, according to my hum- ble opinion, the attention of our present ex- cellent Secretary of State for the Home De- partment, and of their vigilant worships of Bow Street and elsewhere. All I shall say is, that, if there be not at present any regulation of po- lice, capable of reaching these Mural Defacers of some of the handsomest edifices in and about the first metropolis in the world, it is high time there should be one ! The nuisance ought forthwith to be abated. Of such men I say, \" Hie Niger est ; hunc tu Romane caveto !\" In calling the public attention to this most offensive practice, I have done no more than my duty \u2014 liberavi animam meam ! But, to return to my story. The knight of the quill, observing his coat and his inexpressi bles in this filthy condition, was actually on the"], [371, "335 VENICE. point of setting down to send to the celebrated M. Chaptal at Paris, an account of his new and most wonderful discovery, when he was let into the secret by one of his fellow clerks. He thereupon laughed heartily at his mistake ; and ever after, when ink was wanted in the office, the clerks would humorously say, \" let us go under the projections and get some ; for it is of a deeper black there, than any that we can elsewhere procure.\" It is most unaccountable, that, out of so many thousand travellers, who have been in Italy, none of them, as I recollect, have hitherto had the curiosity to visit this, the Siberia of Italy ; or given to the world a description of its singular inhabitants. At least, I do not remember to have seen them mentioned in any of the numerous books of travels, as they are called, that have recently been published. From their very ancient origin, they appear to me to deserve a particular notice. The description I have given of them will be found strikingly correct : and I think I shall be allowed to have had some opportunities of becoming acquainted with this people, when I state, that I have done what, I will venture to say, no woman in England but myself has done ; namely, lived amongst them during the space of fourteen"], [372, "336 VENICE. long months, without so much as once descend ing the mountains, until, as my countrymen are accustomed to say, I quitted them \" for good.\" During the long winter evenings, it is not at all uncommon, at Asiago, to be favoured with visits from a whole troop of hungry foxes. However, the danger to be apprehended from them is generally avoided, by the timely howl ing of the dogs ; who scent them at a con siderable distance, and thereby afford the in habitants time to shut themselves up in their houses ; whence they fire upon the crafty ani mals, through their oiled-paper windows ; for few indeed of the houses have glass ones. The people of Asiago bear a striking re semblance to the feudal slaves of Russia and Poland. In one of the villages, called Enego, some straw hats are manufactured. While the Marquis di Solari was Prefect, from the liberal commissions which he gave them for his nume rous Venetian friends and acquaintances, and from the endeavours which he made, at his own expense, to instruct the natives in imitating those which are manufactured by the Floren tines, he succeeded in getting three completed, in time to be sent to Milan and placed in the public exhibition, with the oth.r specimens of the manufactures of Italy. One of them was"], [373, "337 VENICE. presented by his lady to the Vice-queen of Italy ; the second was given to the Countess Warum, her female in waiting ; and the third to Count Brema, Secretary of State ; and all which were most graciously accepted. Grieved, however, am I to announce to the world, lhat this worthy and upright magistrate, the Marquis Antonio Govion Broglio Solari, fell a sacrifice, in consequence of his happening to be the husband of a British-born subject, who had scorned to betray her native country ; who was known to have been, at one time, une attachee of a great personage at the Bourbon court ; and who had humanely interested her self in behalf of the unfortunate sufferers by Napoleon's accursed Milan and Berlin decrees. And, having once more mentioned these decrees, I think I cannot do better than close my account of Venice ; as well as the first volume of my labours, with the following in teresting particulars, relative thereto. The aforesaid lady was sent for to Milan ; when it was proposed to her, that she should accompany some of the agents of the French Government to England ; there to give immense commissions for goods, in all the different manu facturing towhA of England, Scotland, and Ire land. A considerable sum was to be advanced ; vol. 1. z"], [374, "338 VENICE. but the bulk of the articles, when finished, were to be left on the hands of the manufacturers ; which, it was calculated, would occasion a general ferment and even disturbance, at one and the same time throughout the united king dom, and lead, by the assistance of certain individuals well bribed for the purpose, to par tial, if not to general commotion and rebellion ; and in consequence of which state of com motion, the Government would be driven to make peace \u2014 \" all for the good,\" as the parties in question said, \" of Old England.\" To which the said lady gave this sensible and dignified reply \u2014 \" That she was too well acquainted with the spirit ofthe British Govern ment to suppose it could be driven by the ine briety of a rude mob, to conclude a peace which should be disgraceful and ruinous to the nation.\" She was thereupon answered \u2014 \" That there were many persons in England, and even in the House of Commons, who were adverse to the war.\" \" It required no ghost,\" she replied, \" to bring me that intelligence ; since I am con vinced of it better than you can tell me, as long as it continued to be a political war ; which never can, and never will be generally popular, in a commercial country like England, the"], [375, "339 V E N I C E. emporium and the monopolizer of all the com merce of the world. These very partizans of whom you are speaking no longer exist; all are now united in the common cause of their country. Your decrees from Berlin and from Milan, have changed the very character of the war. It is no longer a political one. These fallacious measures of yours have made it a national one ; and by that step you have done more for England, than England ever before did for herself. You have united all parties. There is now but one voice, Your decrees for burn ing her manufactures whenever they shall be found on the Continent, have drawn all the waters of the three islands to one point ; and, until you can contrive to have a navy superior to the navy of England, their waters will ex tinguish all the fires that you may think proper to kindle.\" Thus spake the aforesaid lady. \" You forget,\" replied those who heard her, \" that you are now an Italian subject.\" \" And therefore,\" rejoined she, con molto spirito, \" I speak as an honest British subject ought to speak. I should be unworthy of my birthright and of your confidence, if I were to deceive you.

I certainly wish well to Italy ; but I never will basely assist in the destruction of the country that gave me birth, and in which I first beheld the light of heaven !\" \" You take up the matter too seriously, Ma dam !\" \" I am very glad you think so, Sir.

Women, however, in these matters, cut but a miserable figure !\" \" But, not women like you, Madam !\" \" Then, Sir, if you allow me to possess a grain of common sense, I shall consider your urging this matter any further as an insult to my understanding.\" The person with whom I had this disagree able conversation then retired ; after which, I heard some one in another room say \" Eh bien I"], [377, "341 VENICE. mon ami, si elle ne veuxpas, que voulez-vous faire?\" The same individual speedily returned, and began again, by saying \u2014 \" I am very glad, Madam, to find that you are the wife of a gentleman who is so amazingly rich that a hundred thousand livres is considered a trifle by you.\" \" Unfortunately, Sir, my husband is not rich. The revolution has taken good care of that! But his wife will never aggravate his misfortunes, by compromising what is dearer to him than life \u2014 his honour!\" \" Why, you were not so mighty scrupulous, Madam, when you were employed by the Prin cess Lamballe, and by the Queen of France, and by her sister, the Queen of Naples !\" \" No, Sir, I had then no reason. I was permitted to take copies of the letters I was charged with, that I might not commit myself; I have kept them to this day, and will show you them, whenever you please ; though they mere ly related to family matters.\" \" So you are pleased to say, Madam ; and of course, I must not dispute a lady's word ! But, however, suppose you return to Venice, and reflect on what I have been saying to you \u2014 \" Here I stopped him short, in the middle ofhis speech, and told him I had already sufficiently z 3"], [378, "342 VENICE. reflected upon the matter, and that nothing could divert me from my determination. \" Well, all I can say, Madam, is, that I am sorry you should stand so much in your own light.\" He then handed me to my carriage, and I returned immediately to my husband. So greatly was I agitated, and so much what had occurred had changed my countenance, that my man servant asked whether I was not ill, and whether he should not step and get me some refreshments ? I told him I was not ill. I, however, was shortly after obliged to stop the carriage, and take a glass of water. Indeed, the bare mention of the names of the illustrious persons last mentioned, and the recollection of their cruel fate, has ever affected me, and con tinues to do so to this very hour. On reaching home, I instantly made my hus band acquainted with the whole transaction ; at which he was much surprised ; as he had not the slightest suspicion that I had been sent for on such a piece of business, but supposed it to relate solely to the arrests that had taken place, about that time, of all the English ; and as a Mr. Parr, an English gentleman, supposed to be the husband of a Venetian lady, had been just arrested, though a constant resident in the"], [379, "343 VENICE. Venetian territories, and principally at Venice, my husband conjectured that the French agents wished to be informed, whether or not they were British subjects ? However, a few days after, coming from a ball which was given at the theatre La Fenice, an officer called at our casino ; and being in formed where we were gone, he waited our return. Scarcely had we reached home, when the said officer knocked at our door. Upon which the servant said, \" O, that's the man, I suppose, who has been asking, three or four times this evening, for my mistress.\" It was now between three or four o'clock in the morn ing. My husband, seizing his pistols, ran to the window, and asked who was there ? Upon which, the officer cried out, \" You must open the door, for I want to come in.\" My husband was on the point of firing at the fellow, but I prevailed on him to hear what he had to say in defence of his extraordinary conduct. On entering the casino, and seeing my husband, whom he had formerly served in a menial capa city, when he was employed under the republic, the man was so astounded, that for some mi nutes he could not utter a syllable. At length, he stammered out, \" I am ordered to keep a sharp look-out upon that lady.\" z 4"], [380, "344 VENICE. \" Well ! there she is,\" said my husband, taking me by the hand, \" look at her ; but I am now going to bed with her, and if you dare to offer the smallest violence, or attempt to come into the room, I will that moment blow your brains out. Shew me your authority.\" \" I have none,\" said the officer, \" but that which I have just mentioned ;\" for he was only one of the runners of the police. On the next morning I was allowed to go to my country residence at Treviso, accom panied by this man, who followed my footsteps, even to church. For the two first days, I only walked about my garden, and on the third and fourth, upon the high road ; and, on my return, I always gave directions to have him well taken care of previous to my taking my own break fast. On the fifth day, he left me to take my walk by myself; when, without taking any thing with me but what I had on, I set off' in a post chaise for Venice, and, scraping together a few hundred dollars, I hired a fishing boat, as I knew that the British squadron was then block ading the ports in the Adriatic ; but, contrary winds detained me in this open boat for more than three days ; when I came up with Admi ral Fremantle's ship, which took me to Malta ; from which place I wrote to my husband, and"], [381, "VENICE. 345 then set off for Sicily, where I continued until the peace. Whether this business was planned at Paris, at Milan, or at Venice, I am unable to say ; but it took place while Napoleon was in Russia.

A few more anecdotes illustrative of the con duct of Buonaparte towards the people of Venice, and I have done. As I have already stated, Buonaparte never had the courage to pay a visit to that city, until he had been crowned Emperor of France and King of Italy ; which event took place in 1810. Nevertheless, in the year 1796, shortly alter he had upset and"], [383, "VENICE. 347 revolutionized the Venetian government, he caused a picture to be painted of himself and staff, in which he was represented as reviewing the cavalry in the Piazza di San Marco ; and from which picture a print was actually en graved and publicly sold at Paris! Now, to those who know any thing of Venice, and that St. Mark's Place is paved with large broad flag stones, and was never intended for equestrian prancings, the absurdity of the thing will be sufficiently apparent. This reminds me of another piece of Parisian gasconade, which occurred while I was in Po land. I say \" Parisian,\" for, according to their own account, all Frenchmen are Parisians. On my return to Italy from Sweden and Rus sia, dining one day with the Princess Lubor miski, at Warsaw, during my visit to that amia ble and accomplished lady, one of the party was a Parisian traveller, whose tongue went at a quicker pace than his body. Being asked, in the course of conversation, how h'e liked the city of Venice, the impudent braggart replied, with the utmost sang froid, that, \" he could not tell us much about Venice, as he had only stopped there to change horses ! !\" This anecdote I introduce by way of a cau tion to such of my readers as may be too much"], [384, "348 VENICE. in the habit of swallowing with greedy appetite every thing that is told them by the mercenary advocates of the revolutionary system, respect ing the wonderful exploits of Buonaparte, which have been so loudly trumpeted forth by indi viduals, who have doubtless had weighty reasons for so doing ; and several of them, aware of the gullibility of my countrymen, and who have taken for their motto the answer of Vespasian to his son Titus, when the latter reproached him with having laid a tax upon a certain article\u2014 \" Lucri bonus odor, ex re qualibet \u2014 are said to have reaped a tolerable harvest from their base and filthy employ. Thanks, however, to the native good sense of my countrymen, I am happy to see that they are rapidly returning to their sober senses, and that the writings of the whole train of Imperial White-washers are sinking into that contempt, which the utter worthlessness of the trash they have been imposing upon the public, so loudly called for. That Buonaparte did more mischief in the course of his reign than can be redeemed for centuries, and that he is more to be condemned for the good which he left undone, than for the evil which he accomplished, are facts which"], [385, "349 VENICE. cannot be denied. It must, nevertheless, be granted by all, that an individual who had risen from nothing, to such an unexampled pitch of domination, must have been in possession of most extraordinary talents. Indeed, not to accord to him an amazing tact, in discriminating the objects that could be rendered most con ducive to his several views of aggrandizement, would be the height of folly and of ignorance. I like not to disturb the dead. I must, how ever, be here permitted to make a short dis gression. Since the masterly castigation which \" Le Docteur \" O'Meara's white-washing per formance recently met with from a most able quarterly critic, it is with considerable reluctance that I am induced to \" draw its frail ties from their dread abode ;\" but \" Monsieur Le Docteur \" appears to me \u2014 to speak in the mildest terms \u2014 to have been, in one instance, so completely imposed upon by the Imperial hoaxer, while at St. Helena, that I cannot withstand the temptation of referring to it In page 163 of the first volume, of his \" Voice from St. Helena,\" Buonaparte is made to say to the Doctor, \" Fouche is a miscreant of all colours, a priest, a terrorist, and one who took an active part in many bloody scenes in the revolution. He is a man who can worm"], [386, "350 V E N I C E. all your secrets out of you, with an air of calm ness and unconcern. He is very rich, but his riches were badly acquired. There was a tax upon gambling-houses in Paris ; but, as it was an infamous way of gaining money, I did not like to profit by it, and therefore ordered, that the amount of the tax should be appropriated to an hospital for the poor. It amounted to some millions ; but Fouche, who had the col lecting of the impost, put many of them into his own pockets, and it was impossible for me to discover the real yearly sum total.\" Now, that Fouche was the infamous character which the moral imperial hoaxer here represents him to have been, little doubt can, I believe, be entertained, since he was the active instrument of most of Buonaparte's own atrocious misdeeds: so much so, that the latter did not dare to remove him from the office which he held, for fear of his disclosing some of the many enormities which he had directed him to put into execu tion : however, at last, to get rid of this worse than bourreau, Buonaparte sent him ambassador to Rome, with the title of Duke d' Otranto. Now, if Fouche was the \" miscreant of all colours \" which Buonaparte represents him to have been, what a superlative \" miscreant \" must the man have been, who could have promoted such a"], [387, "351 VENICE. monster of infamy to the post of ambassador, and advanced him to a dukedom ! As to Fouche's having appropriated the mo ney arising from the plunder of the gaming houses, \" to an hospital for the poor,\" it is false\u2014 -fhlcissimo \u2014 as the greater part of Jose phine's revenue, which Buonaparte allows to have been very large, was drawn from that source of infamy, and Fouche was charged with the task of exacting from the gaming houses, for that purpose, a certain weekly sum, which was regularly transmitted by him, every Mon day morning, into the hands of the aforesaid \" most virtuous queen.\" So much for Buona parte's not liking to profit by such an \" infamous mode of getting money ! \" In charity to \" Le Docteur,\" I am obliged to consider him as the greatest hoaxee \u2014 (may I coin the word?)\u2014 in Christendom ! The truth is, that no work was ever less cal culated, than the \" Voice from St. Helena,\" to give the world correct impressions, with re gard to the real character of the whole Buona parte race, from brother Jerome up to the parent stock, \" la Madre Letizia,\" whose piety, the Doctor tells the good people of England, is so amazingly great, that the old lady's thoughts are \" entirely divided between God and her son!\""], [388, "352 VENICE. And how, indeed, should the Doctor's book be otherwise ? Were not nearly all his facts taken down from the mouth of the murderer of the Duke d'Enghien himself? Would it not, therefore, be just as great a piece of folly to be lieve them, as it would have been in the jury who recently tried the assassin Thurtell, to have acquitted him, on the solemn asseveration of \u2014 \" I am innocent; so help me, God ?\" That theNapoleon fever is greatly abated, and that the pulse of the people has returned to its true beat, the Doctor must, by this time, be pretty well convinced. He has done wisely in not attempting a reply to the strictures to which I have alluded ; for facts are stubborn things, which cannot be got over by empty assertions. Since their appearance, the \" Voice from St. He-. lena\" has become \u2014 \" vox, et pr\u00e6terea nihil.\" I assert fearlessly, that my readers will find, in my next volume, under the head of \" The Buo naparte Family in the Milanese territory,\" a more faithful history of the rise, progress, de cline, and fall of that family, than they will do in all the writings of all Napoleon's numerous thick and thin panegyrists and defenders. I am not setting myself as the apologist of Sir Hudson Lowe. His best praise is to be found in the abuse that has been heaped on him"], [389, "353 VI* NIC E. by the agents of the fugitive from Elba : but this I will say, that all the winnings and whim perings about \" barbarous treatment,\" come with a shocking grace from the man, who had treated some of our countrymen and country women with the utmost cruelty. Of his brutal conduct towards Mrs. Watson I have already given a detail. To which I may add, that on Lord Stewart,- the present Marquis of Londonderry, coming with me Emperor of Austria, to Venice, after the happy downfall of her cruel oppressor, and beholding her emaciated and debilitated condition, he gene rously interested himself with the British Go vernment in her behalf, and proem ed for her a pension of \u00a350 a year for life, as the widow of a man who, for three and forty years, had served his country, in different capacities, with fidelity. Let me also beg leave to tell Doctor Barry O'Meara, late surgeon, that Buonaparte ordered the arrest of Mrs. Spencer Smith, and the arrest of the Marchioness Catherine Hyde So lari, merely because they were English-born subjects, treating them both like state prisoners, and manfully setting a guard, with loaded mus kets and drawn swords at the doors of their very bed rooms! Now, to put the thing more home, I vol. i. 2 A"], [390, "354 VENICE. ask Doctor O'Meara, who is no longer a Benedict, how he would like that a man should stand at the bed-room door of his lady, with a drawn sword in his hand ? The Doctor can, I am sure, answer my query, more readily than he can refute the strictures of the Quarterly Re viewers ; and therefore I beg him to do it. The only crime of these ladies was, that they were the subjects of a nation, whose govern ment had baffled all his ambitious views. For Buonaparte not only abhorred the English, but England itself, and has often exclaimed in the presence of the last-mentioned lady, \" bisogna scacciare questa nazione infama dalla carta geo grafrica !\" He detested us in his heart ; what ever he might have endeavoured to make the English incredules at St. Helena believe. He was too artful to condemn, in their presence, the nation that had spared him the igno minous fate of his brother-in-law Murat ; and therefore it was, that he expended his rancour on those who had the immediate care of his person. As to his saying, that the English were a deceitful nation, I am absolutely as tounded, that he should have found any one ready to listen to \u2014 to swallow - to put upon paper \u2014 and finally to give to the world, such a ridiculous fallacy. As I have alluded to Buonaparte's escape"], [391, "355 VENICE. from Elba, the recollection of which escape rendered vigilance on the part of the Governor of St. Helena a thousand-fold more imperative, I shall here introduce a short anecdote or two. When Buonaparte abdicated, in 1814, I happened to be at Zante, one of the Ionian Islands. On my return to Venice, I was cre- dibly informed, by a person who was strongly attached to him, that, previously to his quitting Paris for Elba, he had said, in confidence, to Marshal Ney, \" Italy will always be a resource for me.\" And indeed, if he could have made up his mind to limit his ambition to the govern- ment of that country, and to give to it a bond fide representative constitution, he would i ot have been suffered to remain a prisoner at Elba for eight and forty hours ; all Italy would have risen up as one man, and flocked to his standard, from their natural abhorrence to the Germans. But, the truth is, that he had made up his mind, from the first, to return ; and had never seriously abandoned the idea of again becoming the sovereign of France. The correspondence, and the visits back wards and forwards, from France to Elba, were innumerable. Buonaparte's apparent in difference and resignation to his fate, lulled the suspicions of the sovereigns who had banished 2 a 2"], [392, "356 VENICE. him to that pleasant island, where he could almost behold both France and Italy. To keep them still further in the dark, with regard to his future intentions, Buonaparte set about building, and expended considerable sums at Elba ; as if he had really determined on taking up his abode in the island for the remainder of his days. A gentleman, on his return from one of these trips to Elba, on being catechized as to the fact of Buonaparte's activity in his new residence, and as to his preparations for new buildings, answered, \" O ! he'll never live to finish all the plans which he is determined to execute. Few people, you know, who build palaces ever live to enjoy them. His family, however, may.\" This very person, however, must, at the time, have been in the secret of his intended escape from Elba ; as it took place only a day or two after he had left the island. On the evening that the news of this escape reached Venice, I happened to be at the con versazione of the once celebrated Madame Marina Benzona, now married to Rangoni When Marshal Chatlaire entered, he announced to us what had happened. This gentleman, who belonged to the Low Countries, was then in the service of Austria, as he had been for years ;"], [393, "357 VENICE. he was therefore one of the class for whom Buonaparte, during the last war in Italy, had caused a general amnesty to be offered, provided they would quit the Austrian service and return home, or accept of rank in the French army. In this amnesty, however, Marshal Chatlaire was not included. On the contrary, Buonaparte had offered 10,000 franks to any one who should bring him, dead or alive, to the head-quarters. \" Now,\" said the Marshal to us, after relating the fact of Buonaparte's escape from Elba, \" I really begin to fancy that my head is in dan ger ;\" adding, \" I am greatly mistaken if this war does not turn out far more murderous and sanguinary, than any we have hitherto witnessed. Unless Europe shall consent to be united against this aggression, in six months' time there will not be such a thing as a legiti mate sovereign on any of its thrones.\" Buonaparte's escape produced little or no sensation at Venice, as it had been foreseen for a long time ; except amongst the few partizans who had lost their employ in consequence of his exile ; and even amongst those individuals, it was looked upon as a sort of desperate deter mination, on the part of Buonaparte, to die nobly, rather than tamely to submit to outlive, in 2 a 3"], [394, "358 VENICE. a pitifully small island, his former unequalled grandeur. But, to return to my subject. That I am no advocate for the Napoleon system of legislation, I think I have pretty plainly shown. I have many weighty reasons for regretting, that it should ever have predominated in Italy, and especially in the once flourishing and happy Venetian States. Truth, however, compels me at the same time to declare, and it would indeed be the height of folly to deny the fact, that the French sway was infinitely more con genial, and more generally advantageous, to all classes of the people of Italy, than the system of government which the Austrians have or ganized for them. It was Buonoparte's constant practice to em ploy thousands of the labouring poor on the high roads; not as they now are engaged, from necessity, in waylaying and in plundering the unoffending traveller, but in keeping those roads in good order, and in repairing the forti fications and the public buildings. The re venues of the Venetian states were principally spent by the French amongst the inhabitants, in affording encouragement to the fine arts, in erecting schools for the education of youth, in maintaining academies for men of science and"], [395, "359 VENICE. literature, and in giving salaries to persons of the bar, for devising means for the more prompt administration of justice. Napoleon, too, whenever an author had the good fortune to meet with a Mec\u00e6nas ready to present a work to him, and to say a good word in behalf of the writer, would, as I have before observed, always take a hundred or two copies, and never fewer than fifty, on his own private account ; besides making his staff sub scribe for another hundred, by way of giving encouragement to literature. With the present Emperor of Austria, however, and with some of his brothers \u2014 who certainly understand crusca mente, the meaning of the verb avere, but not the meaning ofthe verb dare\u2014 the only return they make to a poor author on such an occasion, is a letter of thanks \u2014 that is to say, soddisfanno tutti gli Artisti, dmodo loro, con grazie \u2014 which said grazie, as all the world knows, is very unsub stantial diet ! During the Emperor of Austria's first visit to Venice, as the sovereign of those territories, he accepted every thing, of every description, that was presented to him, without once loosening his purse-strings. In short, there was a most striking difference, in this respect, between the 2 a 4"], [396, "vT_ NICE. 360 two Emperors ; for Napoleon was really gene rous in these matters. The same difference appears also to have existed between Napoleon and a certain great hero of our own country. I have been credibly informed \u2014 and the fact can be contradicted isit be untrue \u2014 that a lady, who had written a work in this country, in honour of the illustrious per son's numerous gallant achievements, applied, when it was ready for publication, to an honour able officer, who not only kindly subscribed to the work himself, but used his influence with the hero of it, to procure the lady in question the honour of personally presenting it to the Con queror of the Conqueror. The day for so doing was fixed. The au thoress was received by the first captain of the age in the most gentlemanly and benignant manner. Most unequivocally did he express his grateful acknowledgments to the lady, for the time and the attention which she had be stowed on her narrative of his warlike exploits. He complimented her highly on the manner in which it was executed ; and, on conducting her to the door, he furthermore expressed his earnest desire, to know in what way it was in his power to compensate her for all her trouble."], [397, "361 VENICE. The work was published. It had the high honour of being dedicated, by permission, to His Gracious Majesty, King George the Fourth, as well as to his Royal Highness the Duke of York and Albany. The too sanguine authoress had caused it to be got up in the most splendid style of printing. But, alas ! she soon found, that to promise was one thing, but that to take the work and pay for it was another ! To be brief. The result was, that the lady became cruelly embarrassed, inconsequence of theheavy expense she had incurred in her humble attempt to immortalize the deeds ofthe hero in question. In this situation, she made her incarcerated condition known to the consort ofthe said hero. But, proh pudor ! what was her astonishment at finding the copy of her work sent back to her, by the wife of the hero, after it had been kept six months ; and a trifle handed to her, in a degrading manner, through the hands of a common porter at the door of a public office, less in amount, than the sum she received for a single copy, from a sugar-baker in the City ! And this, too \u2014 \" tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ascalon!\" \u2014 to an unfortunate female, of birth and of education, in a strange country, separated, at the distance of thousands of miles, from her husband and family, without"], [398, "362 VENICE. friends, and without any other resources, for the moment, than those which she might derive from the exercise of her talents ; since she had recently been shipwrecked in the port of Boulogne, and had thereby become deprived of every thing she possessed in the world ! Napoleon had many crimes to answer for ; but the crime of ingratitude towards men of genius and talent was not amongst the number. I am far from being one of his admirers. I am, however, for giving the devil his due. If the above harsh treatment of the unfortunate lady in question should, by possibility, have arisen out of accidental negligence or error, the par ties will thank me for thus noticing it. It is never too late to atone for an injury ; especially when that injury has been unintentionally in flicted. Meglio tardo che mai ! The following anecdote will serve to show the opinion of the lower orders of the people of Venice, as to the superiority of the French system of government, over that of the Aus trian. One of those lively set of fellows called the Barcqjuoli, on being reprimanded by his master, for his marked indifference towards the present order of things, and threatened with being discharged, if he obstinately persevered in not being reconciled to the new government,"], [399, "363 VENICE. was asked, how he could forget the plunderings which his countrymen had experienced from Massina, Lecchi, and others, during the reign of the French, whom he was so partial to ? \" O ! yes,\" replied the man. \" I very well recollect their d \u2014 d system of equality in put ting your excellency on a level with me, but in not raising me to an equality with your excel lency : but then, the French did every thing with such a good grace, and at least, left behind them manure for the land ; but as for these cursed Germans, they eat up our provisions \u2014 suspect our honesty \u2014 pay no one a livre \u2014 ill treat us \u2014 and would empty the very temples of Cloacina, send off their contents to their own country, and deprive us of the means of culti vating our fields, if they could do so without any cost to themselves ! And then, the scan dalous way in which they treat our noble and worthy old masters, will ever make me detest them. I should be extremely sorry to be dis charged from your generous service ; yet, if I were forced to starve for it, I could never make up my mind to serve a nation, which has basely made a purchase of my native country. That Buonaparte sold us, is not much to be wondered at, for he was a d \u2014 d scoundrel, without any grain of religion ; but, the Emperor of Ger-"], [400, "364 VENICE. many \u2014 he, you know, is a true Catholic, a legi timate prince, no usurper, and Italian born into the bargain ! Now, I don't know who is the worst of the two ; as the proverb tells us, that ' the receiver i^ as bad as the thief.' For my part, I shall ever consider the man who bought us, and the man who sold us, as our mortal enemies.\" Having ended his speech, the poor fellow left the room, exclaiming, with tears in his eyes, \" O ! la mia povera : nezia!\" Thousands of individuals are of the same way of thinking with this honest Barca juola. Some important anecdotes, illustrative of the conduct of the Austrian Authorities in the Venetian provinces, I reserve for my next volume. END OF VOL. I.
