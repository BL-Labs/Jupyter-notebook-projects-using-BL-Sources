LONDON \u2014 ITS ORIGIN, GENERAL ASPECT, SITUATION, CLIMATE. ITS EXTENT, POPULATION. THE CITY PROPER j THE WEST END. The origin of London is lost in the darkness of ages, and we are reduced to conjecture concerning the actual period of the foundation of this City. All we know is that the Ancient Britons erected some huts which constituted a town, the name of -which, Llyn Dyn (the City on tbe Lake) , transformed by the victorious Romans into Londinium, would furnish us with the etymology of the present English title \u2014 London. C\u00e6sar made no mention of it ; but Tacitus said that Londinium, although not a colony, was resorted to by the merchants of his day. It was not until more than a century after the invasion of England by the Romans, in the year 62, that the town was occupied by them ; but they, nevertheless, did not fortify it until the beginning of thc Fourth Century. The enclosing wall, twenty-two feet high, and bristling with turrets, began at the spot where the Tower of London now stands, and following a course indicated by the thoroughfares called the Minories, Houndsditch, and London Wall, to Aldersgate and Ludgate, skirted the Thames from the last named locality to its starting point. l"], [14, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 2 Till the last century some portions of this rampart remained, but now there are no traces of it save two or three fragments in London Wall and at Ludgate Hill. After the Romans, the Danes seized upon London, which they burned, and where they have left but few traces. To the Danes succeeded the Anglo-Saxons, who were conquered bv William and his Norman adventurers. It was under the Conqueror's rule that the Tower of London was built, and the town of London assumed an importance which has been increasing ever since. Up to the Sixteenth Century, never theless, the capital of England does not appear to have extended beyond the boundaries of the actual City, as may be ascertained from a plan published about 15G0, when what is called the Strand was then the highway between London and West minster. At that period, London comprised about 150,000 inhabitants ; a hundred years later, in 1661, Graunt estimated the population at 384,000 souls; but in this calcula tion, the inhabitants of the outlying districts were, in all probability, included. LONDON WALL. From the epoch of George I., tbe city developed rapidly; the various villages -which surrounded it were absorbed; the roads became streets; the fields became covered with houses; but we cannot positively give the number of the population, because the first census was not taken until 1801. In that year the total population of the metropolis, including the city of Westminster, the borough of Southwark, and the neighbouring places, was 864,845 inhabitants. In 1841 there were 1,873,000. So the population had increased by more than a million in forty years. Ten years later the census returns showed 2,361,640 inliabitants; in 1861, 2,803,034; in 1871,3,266,987; and in 1881, 3,832,441. By these figures it will be perceived that every decade adds about half a million of inhabitants to the population of London. The causes of this rapid increment of the population are multifarious, and could not be enumerated here without exceeding the limits of this work. Nevertheless, it may be as well to mention that the Briton, who is not called upon by conscription or military duties, and who from his youth sees his future cut out for him, marries young, and usually has a large family. In the returns of births, London scarcely figures less than all the provinces, the percentage in the metropolis being 34-7 per thousand, while for the rest of tbe United Kingdom it is 35*6 per thousand. As a matter of fact, modern London \u2014 the World's Metropolis as the English love to call it,\u2014 the capital of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as it should be called \u2014 in no way resembles the great Continental Cities, such as Paris, Vienna, or"], [15, "THE CITY. 3 Berlin. From its very vastness London is, as has been very happily said, \" A province covered with houses.\" By its geographical situation, London \u2014 about forty miles from the sea, with which it is in direct communication by a river (unspanned by a single bridge) by which the largest vessels can ascend to its docks and quays \u2014 is one of the greatest commercial ports in the world. By its wealth, by the prodigious development of its commerce, by the number of industries which it shelters, and the working population which it employs, it is one of the greatest industrial centres of Europe. It is from this triple point of view, that one must regard London at once as the capital , the seaport, and the manufacturing centre. It is difficult to say where London begins, or where it ends, for the very good reason, that having no fortifications, nor octroi boundaries if octroi does not exist in England), it assumes the characteristics of a drop of oil, and extends more and more, day hy day, without anything hindering the increase of its area. Even the administrative divisions are not in agreement with each other; but if we accept as a basis the extent which is under the surveillance of the Metropolitan and the City Police, the superficial area of London is 441,000 acres, and its population 4,800,000 inhab itants. Separated into two unequal parts by the Thames, wliich traverses it from west to east, describing many extensive curves, London is situated in four counties, which are, on the north, Middlesex and Essex ; on the south, Surrey and Kent. It embraces the old cities of London and Westminster, the borough of Southwark and forty other boroughs or villages, successively absorbed in the modern town, of which the extreme points are: Hampstead in the north; Greenwich and Woolwich in the east; Streatham in the south; Hammersmith and Fulham in the west. The climate of London is temperate ; it is less cold there in winter, and less hot in summer, than in Paris ; but the plague of the city is fog : that thick yellow or tawny fog, of which the banks of the Thames possess the melancholy monopoly. As soon as November comes we must resign ourselves to the absence of the sun, or but very occasional glimpses of it. Fog is the order of the day. It obscures the streets, which become, consequently, dangerous ; penetrates, notwithstanding all precautions, into the best protected houses; invades the theatres; and extends throughout the city, carrying with it, not only darkness, but an acrid smell of coal-smoke. AVe have known a fog to last for a week, when there was no perceptible difference between night and day. Such an instance as this is luckily rare, but at all times during the winter one is liable to see a sudden curtain of fog come down and remain brooding over London for one, two, or three hours, or a day. Sometimes it disappears as quickly as it fell, or travels away on the wings of the wind to visit all quarters of the metropolis in succession. At other times it is purely local, and forces itself into one corner of London, which is consequently plunged in obscurity while other districts are comparatively bright. The foggy days are dreaded by invalids, and the month of November is fatal to weak and delicate persons. Nevertheless, thanks to the hygienic precautions taken by the authorities, and the admirable system of drainage adopted by the Municipality, London is one of the healthiest cities of Europe, and may be stated, without fear of contradic tion, to be the most healthy of the great capitals; for the mortality is only 20*4 per thousand of the inhabitants, %"], [16, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 4 Like all other cities, London increases westwards, and on that side of the metropolis are tbe most beautiful quarters inhabited by the most aristocratic and the wealthiest classes of English society. In the East End is found the old town\u2014 that is to say, thc City\u2014 and farther east still, the docks and the dockyards and ship-budding yards, which line both sides of the Thames\u2014 from London Bridge to Blackwall on the left bank, THE THAMES. and to Greenwich on the right bank. So we may divide the metropolis into two distinct parts, viz., the City \u2014 the business quarter, the centre of commerce and industry; and the West End \u2014 the aristocratic quarter, the centre of luxury and pleasure, the seat of government and of the public offices. Notwithstanding the great extent of London, it is still easy enough to find your way about \u2014 at least, in that central portion of the metropolis which does not include the suburbs. The majority of the principal streets run north to south, or east to west; a map will show this in a moment. Taking Charing Cross as a central point \u2014 or let us say rather, Trafalgar Square, wherein is the Nelson column \u2014 the visitor will perceive two broad, almost straight and uninterrupted lines from the westward; one passing north, the other to the south of Hyde Park, and tending towards the City, where both approach in the vicinity of St. Paul's Cathedral. The former of these lines is composed of Oxford Street and Holborn ; the latter is formed by Piccadilly, the Strand, and Fleet Street. As the communication between Piccadilly and the Strand is not direct (in a straight line), we must make a bend by Waterloo Place and Pall Mall, wliich leads us into Trafalgar Square, whence the Strand issues. These two great transversal thoroughfares are connected \u2014 commencing at the western extremity \u2014 by Park Latie, which skirts the eastern side of Hyde Park, Bond Street,"], [17, "THE CITY. 5 Regent Street, Chancery Lane, Farringdon Street, and \" Old Bailey.\" These thorough fares extend north and south ; the three latter are in the City, thc others form a portion of tbe West End. Particularly when one is imperfectly acquainted with the English language, it is as well to fix these points on the memory. There is one infallible way by rLAN-GUIDE. which the bewildered traveller who cannot make himself understood may proceed: \u2014 Let him hail a cab, and without saying a word to \"cabby,\" give him written on a piece of paper the address of his hotel, to which he will then be driven without the slightest difficulty. Those who can express themselves in the language of Shakespeare should address themselves to the policemen in preference to any other individuals. This is the only method by wliich accurate information may be obtained, and a number of contretemps avoided \u2014 the least of which is to be sent in a direction diametrically opposite to that in which one wishes to proceed. II. THE CITY OF LONDON. ITS STREETS. \u2014 FLEET STREET AND THE NEWSPAPERS. THE '\"' TIMES,\" \" ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS,\" THE \"GRAPHIC.\" THE CIRCULATING LIBRARIES. The City has been the cradle of London, as L'ile de la Cile was that of ancient Lutetia, now Paris. But there the analogy ceases. The \" City \" is to-day almost exactly what it always has been, and it extends from the Temple \u2014 lately Temple Bar, which has now disappeared, but of which we give an illustration \u2014 to AIdgate, and from the Thames, which bounds it on the south side, to a line irregularly traced by many streets built on the site of the old Roman wall. In the City we find the Bank of England, the Post Office, the Mint, the Stock Exchange, some of the private banks, and the business houses of the principal bankers and merchants, who are known as \" merchant princes.\""], [18, "6 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. The City of London, which since the commencement of the Twelfth Century has formed a separate municipality without having to submit to any considerable change, has now assumed a position of almost unparalleled importance. Its privileges, which it has preserved almost intact since its foundation, and which successive Sovereigns have recognized, have given to the civic authorities an almost legendary prestige. The popular imagination has made the Lord Mayor a redoubtable personage, whose authority equals, if it does not surpass, that of the Sovereign. The City Companies, whose wealth is immense, who possess landed property even in Ireland, exercise an undeniable influence which they endeavour to maintain and extend by all available means. All this contributes to invest the City of London with a power really considerable, but wliich one is apt to exaggerate ; so that on the Continent people regard the Lord Mayor as the greatest functionary of the State, to the great amusement of English people, who laugh pleasantly at what they call the ignorance of strangers, forgetting that there exists amongst themselves the same ignorance. The Corporation of the City of London consists of the Mayor, who has borne the title of \"Lord\" since 1327; 25 Aldermen, 2 Sheriffs, and 206 Common Councilmen. Then follows an army of functionaries \u2014 such as the Chamberlain, the Recorder, the Sword Bearer, the Mace Bearer, the City Marshal, and others, all well paid. The Lord Mayor, elected for a year, is domiciled during the exercise of his high functions in a palace in the City, called the Mansion House, wliich is furnished with regal luxury, and is served by an army of domestics in gorgeous liveries \u2014 occasionally of questionable taste (for every Lord Mayor chooses his own liveries) \u2014 which are the admiration of the loungers on gala days. He receives \u00a310,000 for his expenses, but this sum is always insufficient, and it is seldom that the happy occupant of the Mayoralty gets out of it under an expenditure of \u00a320,000, half of which sum he has himself to pay. Amongst other whimsical privileges, the Lord Mayor used to have the right, when the Sovereign wished to enter the City, to shut the gates, wliich were not opened until the King or Queen had- knocked for admission, and asked leave to enter the sacred precincts. But, now, since the removal of the Temple Bar, the last City Gate, in 1878, there is no need to exercise this privilege. All the rest, Lord Mayor, Corporations, and quasi-royal prerogatives, will soon likewise disappear ! The English are beginning to see that this division ad infinitum of municipal power, and the disputes which supervene, are not calculated to improve the administration of the metropolis. That is the reason why the Government presented a Bill to Parliament, the result of which will be to give London a central municipality, and to wipe out for ever the parochial authorities, who from time immemorial have been intrusted with the \u00c6dileship of the City, and have succeeded so badly. This urgent reform, however, will not be carried out so easily as the evident necessity, to have done with a system whose insufficiency has been so long demonstrated, demands. There will be much weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth; the City Companies, whose coffers are overflowing with guineas, will hesitate at no expense to defend what they imagine to be the rights and liberty of the City; but whatever they may say or do, the Government seems resolved to put an end to the confusion which has reigned so long in the municipal administration of London,"], [19, "THE CITY. 7 The Lord Mayor is, ex officio, a judge of thc Criminal Court, or Court of Assize, held at the Old Bailey, and he sits, as the Aldermen do, at the two City Police Courts. A special police force of 800 men is exclusively charged to maintain order within the City. This force is distinguished from the Metropolitan Police by some slight difference in thc uniform. There is nothing more curious than the appearance of the City streets. Here every one seems to run rather than to walk. The City man goes straight forward like a shot from a cannon. He takes the shortest cuts : his minutes are valuable. Do not stop him to make any inquiry, you will not succeed. The men who carry loads, the porters, will not stop either, and jostle you in the coolest manner possible. As everyone is free to do the same, no one takes offence at such trifles in the City, where collisions and thc rubbing of shoulders are so much current coin, which is exchanged with charming liberality. At ten o'clock in the morning the crowd of vehicles and pedestrians is enormous; it is with considerable difficulty that one can move about. The carriages, omnibuses, cabs, carts, and waggons cause an indescribable block. Every moment the two lines of passing traffic are stopped to permit the stream from the side streets to enter; and certain cross-ways, such as by the Bank of England, for example, where eight great streets converge, disgorging an innumerable quantity of vehicles which cross each other in every direction, are every day the theatre of accidents \u2014 some very serious ones. The crossings of these streets are always dangerous. Notwithstanding the vigilance of the police, and the skill witb which they momentarily suspend the traffic to permit the passage of pedestrians from one side to the other, the number of victims to their own imprudence is still considerable. It is related of one of the most experienced of the Alpine guides of Chamounix that, after he had crossed one of these streets, he declared nothing should induce him to repeat the transit, as he found the passes of the Alps infinitely less dangerous and formidable than the streets of London. The cabs prowling along only add to the confusion. One of the favourite amusements of the London cabman is to crawl slowly by the kerb-stone so as to prevent pedestrians from passing. These genial knights of the whip follow each other in single file, and find immense pleasure in forming at the intersections of streets a moving barrier of fifteen or twenty vehicles, which it is dangerous to attempt to pass. Unhappy is the pedestrian who makes the attempt. A sudden movement of the hand which holds the reins causes the horse to start forward and overturn the venturesome passenger. Then the laugh comes in. Occasionally this little practical joke is the means by which \" cabby \" is brought before the police court ; but it is seldom, and the delinquent is released with a small fine, or sometimes even a severe magisterial reprimand. Nevertheless, we must recognize the immense superiority of the London cabmen to their brethren in Paris. \"Cabby\" can drive ! At one o'clock in the afternoon the streets are crowded with working men and clerks, who hurry towards the nearest chop-houses and taverns to snatch a hasty but substantial meal. Others seek, in pewter pots, the black or light beer which moistens their modest repast. Through the half-open doors one can perceive the shining counters, the mirrors reflecting the gleams of daylight, obscured at frequent intervals by the"], [20, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 8 passage of some omnibus or heavy-laden waggon. Standing around thc counters is a crowd of men, with their hats on, hastily swallowing a few moutbfuls of food : and then, throwing down a piece of money, they rush away again, leaving tlieir places to be filled up by new-comers as hungry as their predecessors. This manner of eating\u2014 standing, TEMPLE BAR. like animals from a rack \u2014 has something lowering in it, some thing that is repugnant to the French taste and instincts; but it is the custom, and that word explains everything. There are in the City some exceedingly good restaurants, frequented by a more luxurious set of customers, but at which the high prices are not within the compass of employe's of lower grade, who form the most numerous class, and prefer, Avith reason, the modest and less comfortable establishments which abound. Very few women, comparatively speaking, are seen in the City. The great-coat and tall hat predominate there. About six o'clock the City empties itself, the passers-by become fewer; the crowded omnibuses and trains are carrying away in all directions thousands of passengers whom they have brought to town in the morning. At night the City is deserted and almost silent, wrapped in profound repose. The policemen only perambulate the streets, bull's-eye in hand, peering into dark corners, examining the fastenings of houses and warehouses, giving the alarm, or carrying"], [21, "THE CITY. 9 help first in the event of fire. In a few hours the busiest corner in the world has become a dead city. As morning returns, life is born again, each day more feverish, more animated. Time is money ! One of the most lively, and perhaps the most picturesque street in all the City, is Fleet Street, by which we penetrate into the City when, going from Charing Cross, we have traversed the whole length of the Strand and passed the new Law Courts \u2014 an immense Gothic edifice lately completed. We then find ourselves in full view of a singular monument \u2014 is it really a monument ? \u2014 which marks the limits of the City at this point, and wliich has replaced the ancient gate of Temple Bar. The \" Griffin,\" as this strange monument is called, is a structure supporting a peculiar animal, whose fore feet are resting upon a shield bearing the City Arms. It is of the heraldic order of sculpture. On the sides of the pedestal are bas-reliefs, reminding us of the glories of the City ; and two statues, representing respectively the Queen and the Prince of Wales. Fleet Street has always been the head-quarters of printers and of publishers, and one even breathes the odour of printing. The ghosts of Johnson, Goldsmith, and the literary men of centuries past, flit through this street, so full of movement, so picturesque, and which has preserved the characteristics of a former age so rarely met with now-a-days. At the first glance, almost immediately on entering it, Fleet Street strikes even the superficial observer; it is nothing but a street of bookshops, printing establishments, and newspaper offices. The windows are garnished with copies of the illustrated papers, in front of which a crowd of curious gazers is collected, a few of whom will not pass on until they have read all they can, down to the name of the printer, in these gratuitously exposed publications. Most of the great daily papers have their offices in or about Fleet Street, except the Times \u2014 for instance, the Standard is in St. Bride's Street ; the Morning Post in Wellington Street, Strand ; and the Daily News chief offices are in Bouverie Street \u2014 and their localities may be easily recognized by the placards containing the summary of the paper of the day fixed at the doors in English fashion. Almost all these news papers are \"lodged\" in luxury, and with an admirable regard to the requirements of such gigantic undertakings. Such are the Standard and the Daily Telegraph, for the accommodation of which veritable palaces have been erected ; and the Times, which, though not in Fleet Street, is not far from it. First we meet the Daily Neivs, which was founded in 1846, and whose first editor was the late Charles Dickens, who was assisted by a brilliant staff, amongst whom were Douglas Jerrold, John Forster, the friend and biographer of Dickens, Miss Martineau, the celebrated authoress, and many others. Notwithstanding all these elements of success, the journal did not win the popularity that had been expected. Dickens, who was but luke-warm in politics, soon retired from the editorship to devote himself exclusively to fiction, towards which his genius irresistibly attracted him. The Daily Neivs did not succeed any better under the direction of Mr. Dilke and its new proprietors, who, too confident in their star, threw their money out of window, so to speak; and to attract purchasers, reduced the price of the paper to twopence half penny, when the other \" dailies \" were fivepence. In five years the losses had amounted 2"], [22, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 10 to \u00a3200,000. At the present time, after so many vicissitudes, the Daily News occupies a considerable position in the London Press, a success which is due to the abilities of the editors and the enterprising spirit of the proprietors. It is the \u25a0 recognized organ of the Liberal and Radical parties. The circulation of the Daily News is about 100,000 copies. The price of the paper is one penny. But it was to the Daily Telegraph \u2014 the youngest London \" dailies \" \u2014 that the complete revolution of iglish Press is due. In 1855 the first number of \u25a0legraph appeared * it was founded by a Colonel 10 got into debt, and was obliged to resign the paper y.

It was a bold experiment, at a time when the selling at fourpence, to publish for a penny a journal es, giving as much news, and edited with remarkable talent. The success was prodigious * Mr. Levy was justified in his view. The cheap press supplied an evident want, but up to that time no one had dared to enter so boldly"], [23, "THE CITY. 11 into a new groove and to break from all the old traditions ; to do that it was necessary to possess an energy which few could boast of. Figures are dry, but possess a most convincing eloquence. The advertisements inserted in the first number of the Telegraph brought in exactly seven shillings and sixpence; at this moment the advertisements realize a sum of \u00a3160,000 per annum, and the circulation is 240,000 copies daily. It will be understood that the new-comer did not want for enemies, but it possessed the advantage of success, and after a miserable existence and a wretched end had been predicted for the Daily Telegraph, the other journals followed suit. The Times is now the only daily paper which is published at threepence. Almost opposite the offices of the Telegraph a crowd may be seen press ing around the Punch office, where the amusing caricatures and cartoons attract the curious, and move even the grave City-man to laughter. Founded in 1841, Punch soon became popular; its attacks upon Sir Robert Peel gave it a political importance whicli it has retained ever since, for it is, above all, the political cartoon which makes the success of the chief comic paper of England. Everyone is acquainted with these cartoons, wliich represent, more than they caricature, the most prominent political personages who, during the last forty years or so, have occupied posts in the administra tions of the United Kingdom. But Punch, who delights in giving advice to \"punch.\" everyone, does not confine himself to reproofs of English politicians : he crosses the Straits easily, and calls continental statesmen to order as well as his own ruling personages at home. Nothing is more interesting and curious than to turn over the back numbers of Punch ,- the history of the past forty years and more is therein traced in comic illustrations, full of good sense and piquancy without acrimony, and endowed with a fund of good humour, with wliich this estimable personage is never unprovided. The manner in which these political cartoons, and the letterpress which accompanies them, are produced, is some- what original, and is little known. There is a weekly dinner, at which the contributors, writers, and artists are present, under the presidency of the Editor, and then the subject for the cartoon is selected. Each person present gives his opinion ; the events of the day are discussed, the leading topic is eliminated, the effective word, the attitude to give to the personages born of the discussion ; and so the next number represents not"], [24, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 12 a fancv or an inspiration of one individual, but the expression of the collective ideas of the entire staff. This accounts for the remarkable fruitfulness of idea, the irrepres- sible \" go,\" which, without such an explana- tion, would be incomprehensible. Politics do not occupy Mr. Punch exclusively by any means : the manners, customs, and ridiculous traits of the entire nation equally come under his paternal criticism. In the number of his collaborateurs Punch has reckoned Albert Smith and Thackeray; as draughtsmen and artists, Birket Foster, John Gilbert, John Leech, so well known by his admirable pictures, and Tenniel, the excel- lent designer of the cartoons. Not far from the Punch office, up a narrow lane on the opposite side of the street, are the offices of the Standard (and also facing St. Bride Street). At first it was an even- ing journal, instituted to carry on a vigorous campaign against Catholic emancipation : this was in 1826-7. In a short time, with the assistance of fanaticism, the circulation rose from seven hundred to more than three thousand; but, nevertheless, that success did not prevent the proprietor from becoming bankrupt. Then, in 1858, Mr. Johnson pur- chased the paper and reduced the price from fourpence to a penny, after the example of the Daily Telegraph. The success of this alteration exceeded all expectation, the \"largest daily paper,\" as it styles itself on its numerous placards, is worth a princely revenue. The Standard is the recognized organ of the Conservative party. In Printing House Square (Blackfriars) I we find the offices of the Times, the best- I known paper in the world, and the most I influential and authoritative of the English I Press ; one which the foreign papers, with I good reason, consider as the organ which I best reflects public opinion in England, I the \"gru-tin.' although it may be that in England itself these opinions have been modified of late years."], [25, "THE CITY. 13 Although it has existed under another name since 1785, the Times really dates only from 1st January, 1788. Its founder, Mr. Walter, whose independence was dis pleasing to the powers that were, had more than once found himself at loggerheads with the Government, who did not spare him either prison or humiliation. In 1803, his son succeeded to the conduct of the paper, to which he gave a new impulse. It was journalism made man. His perseverance, his indefatigable energy, the fertility of his invention, enabled him to sustain the struggle against the Government, then all powerful, and to emerge victorious. One memorable day the then Prime Minister seized in the post all the despatches addressed to the Times. Walter, by no means discouraged by such a trivial circumstance, organized a special service for his own use, and was enabled to announce the capitulation of Flushing \u2014 in 1805, this was \u2014 THE \"DAILY TELEGRAPH\" (ONE-THIRD OF FIRST PAGE). eight and forty hours before the Government itself had received the information. On another occasion, wishing to give his readers the first intelligence of a great political speech at Glasgow, he had it forwarded to London by mounted express. This cost \u00a3200, but he anticipated all other sources of information by twenty-four hours. As early as 1814 he employed steam to print his journal, at the risk of being deserted by his compositors and printers, who dreaded the innovation. He had recourse to a ruse, for, while his men were waiting \" copy,\" he composed and printed the journal in a house close by the office, where he had erected a steam press. Then he came, with the damp sheets in his hand, to announce to his employes that the Times had been printed by steam machinery. He quieted his men by telling them that he had taken measures to put down energetically any attempt at violence ; but that if they conducted themselves properly, he would continue to pay them their wages until they had found other employment. A few statistics will give us an idea of the tremendous development of this journal. The circulation is 80,000, but certain special issues, such as those containing the biography of Prince Albert, or the number devoted to the account of the marriage of the Prince of Wales, have reached fabulous totals. In June, 1884, the press of matter and advertisements necessitated the printing of 24 pages or 144 columns. The cashier of the Times still remembers a day on which the receipts for advertisements exceeded \u00a31,400; the receipts of this department actually reach \u00a320,000 a month, in round numbers, or more than \u00a3240,000 per annum. Mr. John Walter, the"], [26, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 14 grandson of the founder, is now the actual proprietor of the Times. He represented Berkshire in Parliament, and is a Liberal in politics, faithful in this respect to the traditions of his family. The Times has never derogated from its high and loyal principles, and we have seen it, with a rare disinterestedness, protest loudly against the Railway Mania of 1845, at the risk of losing some \u00a33,000 a week by the advertisements alone, which the daily newly formed companies of doubtful morality inserted. The political role of the Times, above all things, consists in guiding and enlightening public opinion. It is affiliated to no party, hence the apparent contra dictions, the recantations, sometimes so curious, which are only the natural outcome of the line of conduct wliich the Times has marked out for itself, and rigorously followed since its foundation. We can therefore appreciate what a very delicate task the politic THE \"TIMES\" (ONE-QUARTER OF FIRST PAGE). director of the journal has to perform under such conditions, so as to be in accord with the opinion, not of the most noisy, but of the most numerous class ; not to accept a hasty movement of some for the general sentiment ; not to be \" carried away,\" but to preserve a prudence and sagacity which will not militate 'fegainst a vigorous initiative at critical moments. This crushing responsibility devolves upon the editor, assisted by a numerous and picked staff of writers. As is well known, contributors are never wanting to the Times, and beyond the appointed editorial staff, is a large number of celebrities, political and otherwise, who supply from time to time notable articles, without reckoning the letters which are addressed to the paper from every part of the world. The correspondents of the Times abroad are regarded as diplomatists in partibus, and curiously enough, they are almost all of foreign nationality. As articles are not signed, the irritating polemics from journal to journal, from editor to editor, are things unknown in the English press ; the more so as by a curious custom, each paper treats the subject from a different point of view of its own, without noticing the opinions of the other journals, and absolutely as if it stood alone in journalism. If by this course, the public is deprived of some brilliant articles, it gains on the other hand by the quantity and accuracy of the information it receives, the well considered \"leaders\" so soberly written, which guide and enlighten it, without the personality of the writer giving to his reflections an individual bias, certainly flattering to the author, but of wliich the danger is at times great, and apt to lead opinions astray."], [27, "THE CITY. 15 London has many weekly illustrated papers. The two principal of these which dispute for public favour are the Illustrated London News and the Graphic. The offices of both these journals are situated in the Strand close to each other, and a few paces from the entrance to the City. The Illustrated London Neivs, the first pictorial journal established in England, was founded in 1841, by Mr. Herbert Ingram, an energetic and able man, whose enter prise attained an undoubted success. Applying to the illustrated press the principle of the daily papers, he surrounded himself with a staff of contributors and artists of high merit, secured the assistance of correspondents in all parts of the globe, and made the \"Illustration de Londres,\" as the paper is called on the continent, a journal of the highest interest as much by the text as by the illustrations with which it was filled. For thirty years this interesting serial continued its triumphant progress, un dimmed by the pale lustre of any weekly rivals, which sought to compete with it in public favour, and died in a few we-ks. It was not until 1870 that its rival, the Graphic, now celebrated, proved that there was room for another pictorial paper by the side of the Illustrated. It is only fair to say that the Graphic, excellently illustrated, edited and conducted with rare ability, continues to merit the success which it met with on its first appearance. Perhaps the Franco- German War, whicli broke out soon after the establishment of the Graphic, had something to do with its success, for it appeared at a time when the public, greedy for news and pictures illustrating the principal incidents of the War, made a raid on all journals, whether illustrated or not. There was, during the annee terrible, a Homeric struggle between the two great illustrated London papers to be first in the field, and to give to the public the representations of the most recent events. Besides pictures, and their relative letter-press, the Graphic publishes special articles, and tales written by favourite authors, illustrated by exceUent artists. At Christmas-time these papers produce special numbers profusely illustrated, and containing a large chromo-lithograph, for which some celebrated painter has supplied the original. Thus some of the engravings signed by Millais, Leighton, Herkomer, and others, have cost as much as a thousand pounds sterling each. The circulation of these Christmas Numbers, which are sold at a shilling a piece, reaches the enormous figure of about half a million copies. The usual price of the paper is sixpence. Let us add a few statistics relative to this subject. There are, at this moment, in the United Kingdom 1,817 papers of all classes; 1,458 of these are published in England (London alone has 375) ; there are 183 in Scotland, 156 in Ireland, and 20 in the Islands. The number of Magazines and Reviews is considerable, they reach a total of 1,180, of which 300 are exclusively devoted to religious topics and polemical discussion. The English public is very eager for information \u2014 correct, precise, and rapid. Everyone reads two newspapers a day, without reckoning the numerous periodicals which are placed on every table in every library of the aristocratic mansions, as well as in the middle-class houses, and which everyone reads. The English people are the greatest readers on earth; the taste for reading is with them almost a passion.

French modern literature is well known in England, and many French authors are highly appreciated there. But as it would be ruinous to purchase all the books one wishes to read, a system of Circulating Libraries has been insti tuted. These are establishments at which subscribers of sums varying from one to four guineas, according to the number of the volumes lent, may obtain all the books antl reviews \u2014 English, French, German, or Italian \u2014 whether new or old, they may require. The most important of these establishments is Mudie's Library, which includes about (J00,000 volumes. It is estimated that about 10,000 entries and despatches of books per day take place at Mudie's alone. Other libraries of later introduction have rapidly reached an important position. There are some Circulating Libraries which supply foreign works exclusively ; a fact which suf ficiently indicates the taste of the English people for the literature of other countries. Sometimes subscribers make pencilled marginal notes in the volumes they read, especially in foreign books, and these are often instructive. In a French novel the author, wishing to picture a very wealthy duke, gave him an income of 200,000 francs. The English reader wrote in the margin, \",\u00a38,000 sterling; what an income for a duke ! \" The Englishman derided such a revenue as that for a man occupying such an POLICEMAN. elevated position in the aristocratic world.

THE ANCIENT CITY. REMAINS OF ROMAN LONDON. THE LONDON STONE. THE TOWER. \u2014 QUEEN VICTORIA'S KEYS. \u2014 ST. JOHN'S GATE. SHAKESPEARE'S HOUSE. The almost entire absence of ancient monuments in a city, the origin of wliich is so antiquated, is not one of the least surprises which London presents to the stranger. One fancies usually that the old \"City\" encloses a number of old (secular) edifices; that in those dark streets and obscure passages called \"lanes,\" new buildings would be the exception, not the rule. But this is an error. The dark houses which border the City ways are relatively modern, for, notwithstanding the respect whicli the English profess for all that savours of antiquity ; notwithstanding their love for old customs and ancient traditions (the word \"old\" is in English a term of affection), they know how to make allowance for increasing necessities and new wants, and sacrifice \u2014 not without hesitation, it is true, but nevertheless with determination \u2014 -all the ancient monuments which, useless or in the way, impede the development of their metropolis. It is for this reason tbat the picturesque houses, which formerly were visible in the City, have almost entirely disappeared, and are now replaced by massive edifices, in which iron, stone, and marble, are used profusely ; and while thus beautifying the City, the aspect of which is changing day by day, the Londoners are protecting it against destruction by fire, of which the risks in London are so great. As a matter of fact, at all times the City has had to contend against this formidable foe. Seven times before the terrible catastrophe of 1666, whicli destroyed 13,000 houses and 87 churches, the City has been the prey of the flames. One would have fancied that after such severe lessons, the civic authorities, rendered wiser by experience, would have taken measures to prevent the recurrence of similar calamities. But nothing came of it, and it is only within the last few years that the corporation has taken energetic measures, and given the impulse thanks to which the City is losing its picturesqueness, but is gaining in salubrity \u2014 and, let us confess it, in beauty. At the present time, when the pickaxe of the bouse demolisher is finishing the work begun by fire, there remain but a few scarce vestiges of ancient London, known ouly to arch\u00e6ologists and antiquaries, who deplore the approaching disappearance of oven these remains. Let us pass them quickly in review, and salute in these old ruins a past time of blood and barbarism, but a period not without glory and grandeur as well. Of the Roman enceinte, built in the year 306, there remain but a few fragments in the street called London Wall, near St. Alphage's Church, in Bloomfield Street, Finsbury, and in St. Martin's Court, on the South side of Ludgate Hill. Another very interesting relic, also dating from the Roman period, is the London Stone encased in the wall of St. Swithin's Church, opposite Cannon Street Railway Station. All opinions agree in recognizing this block of granite as a \" mile-stone,\" placed by the Romans in the centre of the town, like that in the Forum at Rome, from which all distances were"], [31, "THE CITY 19 measured. This stone has changed its place many times, and would have been lost had not Mr. Maiden, an antiquary, rescued it in the last century, and obtained the permission of the parochial authorities for its preservation. Under the Coal Exchange in Lower Thames Street, besides this relic, the remains of a hypocaust were discovered, and may still be inspected ; while in the Strand, at some little distance from Somerset House, a narrow alley conducts the visitor to a bathing establishment, of which the piscina appears to have been constructed by the Romans. No trace of Anglo-Saxon London, the capital of the Kingdom of Essex, exists. Burned by the Danes in 851, the town built by Alfred was totally destroyed by fire in 886, and to recall the old City and the Middle Ages, nothing remains but the Tower of London, and some crypts concealed by modern edifices. LONDON STONE. The Tower of London is beyond all question the most interesting monument in the City. It is situated at the end of Tower Street upon a rising ground, which it covers, and extends along the Thames. Viewed from the river, the ensemble of ancient embattled walls of dark buildings, which are dominated by the imposing mass of the White Tower, flanked by four pointed turrets, pro duces an indescribable impression on the spectator. It is the em bodiment of the Middle Ages in all its terribleness, surviving in the middle of the 19th Century. It is barbarism, elbowing progress ; it is tbe Feudal System snapping its fingers at Modern Society. What memories are evoked by those walls, on which the action of Time is scarcely perceptible ! First comes William the Conqueror, the founder ofthe Tower of London (some authorities attrihutc it to Julius C\u00e6sar), who, suspicious, and distrusting his subordinates, made it his usual residence.

What sufferings, what crimes,"], [32, "20 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. what horrors, have been compressed into those eight centuries! What august personages, how many innocent victims, whose names occur to us, such as King John, made prisoner at Poitiers ; Charles of Orleans, father of Louis XII. ; Thomas More, Raleigh, Bacon, Strafford, Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard, Jane Grey, the young Princes, and many other personages less known, but fully as deserving of commiseration ! It was at the Tower of London that Henry VIII., in great state, received his wives, and where two of them, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, were beheaded. Under the reign of Mary Tudor, the Princess Elizabeth was incarcerated in the old fortress, ANCIENT PLAN OF THE TOWER. and, though having herself experienced the miseries of the prison, she did not hesitate to consign thither such of her enemies as she could reach when she attained the throne. Later still the infamous Jeffreys therein expiated his cruelties, and died abjectly \u2014 an end worthy of his life. Under George I. the Jacobites were confined in the Tower, and were all executed with the exception of Lords Winton and Nithsdalc, who managed to effect their escape. The latter owed his freedom to thc devotion of his wife and a faithful female servant. These two women made their way to his prison on the clay before that fixed for his execution, and Lord Nithsdale, disguised as the female domestic, quitted the prison and escaped, while the woman remained in bis place in thc cell. These same means, with little variation, were employed to effect the escape of Monsieur de Lavalette from bis prison. Successively a royal residence, a court of justice, a fortress, and a prison, the Tower is now an arsenal, a barrack, a military store depot, and for the public one of the"], [33, "THE TOWER OF LONDON, FROM THE THAMES."], [34, "LONDON ANI) ITS ENVIRONS. 22 curiosities of the metropolis. The last sovereign who resided in the Tower was James I., whose favourite amusement there was in watching fights between lions, and bears, and dogs. He had, in fact, a menagerie there, which was traditionally kept up until 1834. In the 18th Century the Tower lions were named after the reigning sovereign (or Royal Family), and there was a popular belief that when the King died the hon named after him died at the same time. It is by the Lion's Gate \u2014 so called because it is situated near the space formerly occupied by these animals \u2014 that the visitor enters the Tower, which is pro tected by a double enceinte, by ditches, bastions, turrets, case mates, gratings, portcullis, and draw bridge. The visitors in parties of a dozen at a time are conducted by warders clothed in semi-modern costume. They wear the doublet and the head-gear of the Yeomen of the Guard at the time of Henry VIII., and \" in expressibles \" of dark blue bordered with scarlet.

To a Society of Architects is due the preservation of this interesting relic of the past, concerning which, wonderful to relate, the Society of Antiquaries did not trouble themselves. We must not omit to mention in this place, the English branch of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, which at present exists as a purely lay Society, whose mission is to assist convalescents on their leaving the hospitals, and to provide ambulances. A decree of the Court of the Queen's Bench, in 1834, authorized the re-constitution of the order, and confirmed the charter granted by Queen Mary to the Knights of St. John.

THE PRE- SHAKESPEARE'S HOUSE. BENDARIES The City of London possesses a large number of churches, the majority of which are, comparatively speaking, modern, for the Great Fire only left about a dozen standing out of the hundred which had formerly existed in the Old City. Almost all those which we see at present, were built by Wren, or by his numerous pupils. The result is a monotony in construction, decoration, and style. When we have seen one, we have seen all. The crowning work of Sir Christopher Wren is the famous Cathedral of St. Paul, a copy of St. Peter's at Rome. Admirably situated upon an eminence, from which it dominates the town, the Cathedral of London has the worst surroundings which it is possible to imagine. No matter where the spectator stands, far or near, be can never behold but a portion of the edifice. As for viewing it as a whole, it is not to be thought of. From the \" church yard \" it is as much as one can do to see the top, so closely do the houses approach it, especially on the north side : vehicles can only circulate on the south side, which alone is wide enough to allow a carriage-way and a foot-way to be made. There was, at one time, a spot whence an excellent view could be obtained of the facade and the dome, this was at the bottom of Ludgate Hill, an ascending street which leads direct to"], [40, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 28 the Cathedral* but several years ago a clumsy railway viaauci cut me per^c-\u2014 in twain so that at the present time it is difficult to examine, at leisure, the most beautiful modern religious monument in London. To see this Cathedral properly, under its most picturesque aspect, so as to grasp its enormous proportions, the visitor must proceed to Blackfriars Bridge, and even then, he will only be able to survey the upper portion of the edifice. In 1675 the first stone of the present Cathedral was laid, and the edifice was not completed till thirty-five years afterwards, in 1710. Contrary to general experience, the architect had the satisfaction \u25a0 of seeing the completion of the work he had initiated. St. Paul's is built in the form of the Latin Cross. The facade is composed of a portico supported by twelve columns of the Corinthian order, eight composite columns rising above the former and sustaining a pediment ornamented by a bas /\u25a0e/ie/representing the conversion of St. Paul. A statue of the Saint dominates the pediment. At either side of the portico is a clock -tower 220 feet high, ter- minating in a point and con- taining the clock and bells. A gigantic dome, surmounted by a lantern, and gilt ball aud cross. FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S. complete the edifice ; the total height of which is, from the street to the top of the cross, 365 feet. The interior, like all \" Protestant temple \" interiors, is naked and cold, but of great architectural beauty. Entering by the North door, the visitor is immediately under the dome, which is sustained by eight elegant arches, and decorated with some mediocre paintings by Thornhill, representing the principal events in the life of Saint Paul. These are in a deplorable condition, and ought to make way at once for the frescoes executed by Sir Frederick Leighton, thc President of the Royal Academy. In the choir, thc visitor will remark the beautifully carved stalls, the work of Grinling Gibbons, the episcopal throne, the Lord Mayor's chair, the altar, the pulpit, and the organ, which is one of the most beautiful in England. This is very little for so vast an edifice, and one comes away from St. Paul's Cathedral with a profound sense of disappointment. What, no stained glass, no ornaments, nothing but those poor frescoes of Thornhill, paid for \u2014 this is historical \u2014 at \u00a32 the square yard, and the funeral monuments raised to the memory of the heroes who have died for their country \u2014 more interesting because of the memories they arouse than for their artistic value ! The most worthy of notice is the monument of the Duke of AVellington, which is situated to the right of the West doors as"], [41, "ST. Paul's cathedral"], [42, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 30 you enter. It is composed of a sarcophagus, on which is a bronze statue of the deceased warrior. Twelve columns of the Corinthian order support a species of dais, in marble, and two groups representing, respectively, Valour crushing Cowardice, and Truth triumphant over Falsehood. The monument is the work of A. Stephens. The monuments of Nelson, by Flaxman, and of Sir Charles Napier, by Adams, are amongst the most noteworthy. St. Paul's is the burying place, par excellence, of soldiers and sailors. Besides the monuments of Nelson and Wellington, we find those of Picton, killed at Waterloo, Sir John Moore, the adversary of Soult at Corunna, of Admirals Rodney, Duncan, Collingwood, and Saint Vincent. But we do not meet only with the tombs of warriors, for the painters Reynolds, Lawrence, West, Turner, Fuseli, and Landseer, repose here near the celebrated Dr. Johnson, John Rennie, the engineer of Waterloo Bridge, and Sir Christopher Wren, the architect of Saint Paul's. The last named has no special monument erected to his memory, but in the cathedral nave is a mural tablet, which bears his name and the following inscription : \u2014 \" Si monumentum qu\u00e6ris, circumspice.\" It could not be better expressed. The \" chapter \" of Saint Paul's, which is, as we know, the Cathedral of London, consists of a Dean, a Sub-Dean, Four Canons, a Chancellor, and a large number of Vicars and other ecclesiastics. The Sunday services are well attended, but it is seldom that the immense space is filled. Londoners prefer to go to Westminster, to which access is more easy, and where the singing is held in great estimation. The Church of England is divided into two camps, the High Church and the Low Church. The former approaches, in the number of its wax candles, the illumination of the altar, the incense, and the rich priestly vestments, to the pomp of the Roman Catholic Church. It is in these particulars that it irritates the Puritans of the Low Church party, for whom all ornate services, every statue, every painting, is the abomina tion of desolation, and who would banish even the organ from Protestant places of worship. This is, perhaps, the place in which to speak of the Anglican Church. The Church of England is Protestant and Episcopalian. Its doctrines are comprised in the Thirty-nine Articles framed by the Convocation of 1552, revised and definitely established in 1571. The Anglican religion is essentially a religion of State. Legally, the Sovereign is the head of it, and nominates the Archbishops and Bishops by the hands of the First Lord of the Treasury, who dispenses all the Crown patronage. The Church is governed by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, and by thirty Bishops. The highest ecclesiastical dignitary is the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is the Primate of all England. The two Archbishops and twenty-four Bishops sit in the House of Peers. For the direction of affairs ecclesiastic, England is divided into two Provinces \u2014 those of York and Canterbury, each having as chief an Archbishop, assisted by numerous Bishops. There is in each Province a Council, styled Convocation, the members of which are Bishops, Archdeacons, Deans, and representatives elected by the"], [43, "choir of st. Paul's, and Wellington's monument."], [44, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 32 clergy. The Province of Canterbury has two \" Houses,\" the Archbishop and the Bishops sit in one, and the lower clergy in the other. The Members of Convocation in the Province of York sit all together. The revenues of the Church are administered by a Commission, composed of two NAVE OF ST. PAUL'S. Archbishops, twenty Bishops, five Ministers, three Judges, three Deans, and twelve Lay Members. The annual revenue of the Church is estimated at ten mdlions sterling, from which the clergy are largely remunerated, from the Archbishop of Canterbury, with his"], [45, "THE CITY. 33 \u00a315,000 a year, down to the Bishop of Sodor and Man, who receives \u20ac2,000 a year. After the Bishops come the Deans, whose emoluments vary between \u00a33,000 and \u00a3800 a year, and finally the parish Clergymen, including Rectors, Vicars, and Curates. England comprises about 12,000 parishes. At the head of each parish is a Rector, who enjoys all privileges, tithes, and other advantages attached to his benefice. He is assisted by the vicar and the curate, who occupies the last grade in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Besides the Queen, the Lord Chancellor, the Prince of Wales, the Bishops, the Chapters, and the Universities, there are about 3,850 lords and gentlemen, and even ladies, who can dis pose of the benefices at tached to tlieir property. The Anglican clergy reckons 23,000 members, who have the spiritual care of about 13,000,000 of individuals. The in fluence of the clergy is considerable, although carefully disguised; it is easy to understand this influence when one re calls the manner in whicli the livings are awarded, st. Bartholomew's church. and those who dispose of them The other Protestant sects are very numerous, and number some hundred and forty, of which some \u2014 the Salvation Army, for instance \u2014 can scarcely be regarded as religious institutions. As for the Roman Catholic Church, it includes in the United Kingdom about six million members, of whom four millions are in Ireland. The clergy comprise seven Archbishops, forty Bishops, and a great number of Priests of all ranks. Now, are the English a religious people ? Yes, if religion consists chiefly in the regular practice of religious observances \u2014 a strict regard for Sunday, and a marked tendency to quote texts on every occasion. Amongst the well-to-do and aristocratic faith appears rather feeble, and it is above all things for the \" sake of example \" that Society goes to worship, particularly in the country. Some gentlemen, who never enter a church in London, never fail to attend the services in their own parishes. Evidently their 5"], [46, "34 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. convictions do not alter with their change of places ; but it is for the \" sake of setting an example.\" Besides, no one makes any secret of the matter, and this is carried on with a certain amount of frankness. Amongst the lower middle-classes religion assumes a sour and intolerant form, which tends to fanaticism ; but a very curious fanaticism, which does not lose sight of the temple church. the main chance. The Englishman of this persuasion has been well defined in the following classic dialogue between the religious grocer and his shopman : \u2014 \" John, have you sanded the brown sugar ? \" \"Yes, sir.\" \" And put the plaster of Paris in the powdered sugar? \" \" Yes, sir.\""], [47, "THE CITY. 35 \" And the chicory in the coffee ? \" \" Yes, sir.\" \" Very wdl ; now let us go to prayers ! \" The members of this class, it must be added, do not belong to the Church of England, but to independent sects. We meet them in the chapels, and not in the churches dedicated to the orthodox religion. This digression has carried us far away from the City, and the churches it encloses. Let us hasten to return, and glance at the Temple Church, built in 1185, and since frequently restored. It belongs to the two \" Societies \" of the Temple \u2014 a Corporation of Barristers (Benchers). Amongst those churches which escaped the fire, that of St. Andrew's Undershaft * is the most interesting. It is remarkable for its stained-glass windows, and contains a number of monuments, of which the most remarkable is that of John Stow, the historian, who died in 1605. Stow was a tailor by trade, and renounced his humble calling to write the Annals and Chronicles. James I., who has the reputation of having encouraged literary merit, generously granted Stow the permission to beg ! One year after having received this signal mark of his Sovereign's bounty he died in great miserj\\ Let us also mention among the City churches, St. Giles, Cripplegate (surrounded by a garden in which is a portion of the old Roman wall), and St. Bartholomew the Great, in West Smithfield, the tower of which and the roof, in timber with sunken panels, are worth special mention. Here are also several ancient tombs, and a fine crypt. Hogarth, the celebrated painter, was baptized at St. Bartholomew's Church. In general these churches have but a few \" faithful \" attending them, for few people live in the City. Sometimes there is no one in the church \u2014 but that fact does not prevent the vicar from pocketing the comfortable revenues. These livings are the object of lively seeking on the part of the Anglican clergy. A few figures will give us an idea of their value. St, Botolph, Bishopsgate, is worth \u00a31,200; St. Giles, Cripplegate, \u00a31,280. All are evidently not so well endowed, St. Bartholomew-the-Less, for example, only brings in \u00a313; but in general the position of a vicar of a City church is a very easy one, and much to be envied.

Often, very often, the architect has hidden a facade of brick by a facing of cement, which scales off, and the ravages of time become only too visible. One cannot help thinking that under the head of architecture the capital of the United Kingdom leaves much to be desired. The Guildhall of London is the first imposing edifice which one perceives after quitting St. Paul's, and proceeding to the Royal Ex- change, eastward. The Guildhall is situated at the end of King Street, in a cut de sac, in wliich a number of pigeons disport themselves \u2014 the geese of the capitol, which have become as tame as the vulgar Parisian sparrows. The Guildhall, erected in 1411, partly destroyed CRYPT (GUILDHALL). by the fire of 1666, which left only the wall and the crypt uninjured; rebuilt in 1709, and \"restored\" in 1865 and 1867, is by no means worthy of the British Metropolis. The entrance, wholly modern, is wanting in style and elegance, and is scarcely m harmony with the old portions of the edifice, although it was attempted to give it a Gothic air. Above the front are the City Arms, the Sword of St. George, and thc Cross of St. Paul, with the motto Domine dirige nos. Inside, the great hall, open to the public, is an imposing Gothic nave 150 feet long, 50 wide, and 58 high The sides are divided into long panels by clustered columns, from whicli sprino- arched buttresses of exceeding lightness which support the roof. The panels are ornamented with wood-carving most delicately executed, a kind of decoration which we find repeated in the majority of English monuments, and which harmonizes with the Gothic style generally adopted in the country. There are some very commonplace statues, representing Nelson, Wellington, Lord Chatham, William Pitt, Queen Elizabeth, Edward VI and"], [49, "THE CITY. 37 Charles T.

Two large windows, one at each end, permit the entrance of the light, which is subdued by the stained glass windows; at night seven gas lustres serve to seven gas lustres serve to illuminate the hall. It is here that the famous ban quets take place annually on the 9th of November \u2014 the day on which the installation of the new Lord Mayor takes place; and here the meetings and grand receptions of the Corporation are held. These feasts hold an im portant place in the records of the city, and it is not a successful fete which does not wind up with one of those pantagruelian re pasts which have so often given rise to merriment at the expense of the Corpor ation. There is, in the Guild hall, an excellent Public Library, open every day from ten o'clock in the morning until nine in the evening. Here will be found a remarkable collec tion of books and engrav ings relating to the history of London, and a number of old relics discovered in the city. One of the curiosities is a conveyance deed bear ing the authentic signature of William Shakspere \u2014 as the name is therein spelt. GUILDHALL. After having glanced at the tribunals grouped around the Guildhall \u2014 the Police Court, the Lord Mayor's Court, &c. \u2014 we find ourselves again in the street leading to Cheapside, and at the end of the latter thoroughfare we find the \" palace of the first magistrate of the City.\" The Mansion House, the residence of the Lord Mayor, is situated in the heart of"], [51, "THE CITY. 39 the City, facing the Bank of England, near the spot where eight streets converge. It is a square edifice of Portland Stone of a heavy and sombre appearance. The facade consists of the inevitable Greek Colonnade, to which one ascends by a double flight of steps, very narrow. Six columns of the Corinthian order are surmounted by a pedi ment, ornamented by an allegorical bas relief. The principal figures of this composi tion by Sir Robert Taylor represent London, the Thames, Plenty, Envy, and Commerce. The interior of the Mansion House is of great magnificence, the reception-rooms being deco rated with regal splendour. The most celebrated are the Venetian Hall, the Grand Drawing room, the Ball-room, and the Egyptian Hall. The last named, in which are served the splendid banquets, so dear to the City dignitaries, is the GOG AND MAGOG most beautiful and the most vast. Herein 400 persons can be accommodated with ease ; and on gala nights, when it is illuminated by the light of thousands of wax candles, the effect is dazzling in the extreme. A double row of columns sustain the vaulted and panelled LORD MAYOR'S CARRIAGE. ceiling, and at each side in niches are groups and statuary by Foley, Calder-Marshall, Weekes, Durrant, and Lough. There is also a fine picture gallery. The public are not admitted to the Mansion House, but the visitor can see the Lord Mayor or one of the aldermen who sit in turns in the Police Court of the Mansion House itself, and to which everyone has access. It must be added that these worthy functionaries have only a very superficial acquaintance with the intricate laws of their country. So the real magistrate is the chief clerk, whose duties consist in whispering decisions to the alderman, and in"], [52, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 40 discussing points of law with barristers and solicitors when matters assume a serious aspect. It is needless to add that the chief clerk is a practical lawyer. When it happens\u2014 unfortunately, very seldom\u2014 that there is no case to be heard, the alderman, when he arrives in court, is presented with a pair of white gloves by the chief clerk. This very ancient custom is always adhered to not only in the city, but in all English tribunals. The Bank of England is opposite to the Mansion House, and occupies all one side of the open space. It is a vast building, one story high, perfectly isolated, and bounded by four streets. As an extreme precaution, the outer walls MANSION HOUSE. are pierced by no windows ; the offices are lighted from the roof, or from the nine inner courts, and garden. Nothing has been neglected to ensure the Bank against attack, and to guard against the risks from fire. At night a detachment of tbe Foot Guards, commanded by a captain, watches over the safety of \" the old lady of Threadneedle Street.\" During the day the watchmen of the company itself suffice to maintain order. A Scotchman, named Paterson, founded the Bank of England in 1694. Up to that time the business of banking was exclusively in the hands of the goldsmiths, who abused their monopoly. The capital ofthe Bank, which was originally \u00a31,200,000, is now \u00a314,000,000. In September, 1882, the Bank notes in 'circulation reached a total value of \u00a337,000,000, and the bullion kept in reserve amounts to \u00a322,000,000. One must have an order signed by the directors to visit the bullion vaults. The gold is in ingots, of the value of \u00a3800 each, the silver in bars, and in bags of coin. The company is composed of a governor, a deputy-governor, and twenty-four"], [53, "THE CITY. 41 directors, of whom eight retire annually, and are generally re-elected. The operations of the Bank are conducted in the same manner as in financial establishments of the same kind in other countries. The Bank of England, moreover, is entrusted by the Treasury with the arrangements for thc interest on the National Debt, Consols, Annuities, etc., and receives from the Government as payment for its services some thing over \u00a3200,000. There are nine branches of the Bank, situated at Manchester, EGYPTIAN HALL (MANSION HOUSE). Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Plymouth, Newcastle, Hull, and Portsmouth, as well as a branch office in the West End of London. The public are permitted to enter freely into the cashier's department, or where daily business is transacted ; but to penetrate into the other parts, to see the printing of the bank-notes, visitors must be accompanied by one of the directors, or furnished with a special permit, which is difficult to obtain. The printing press is a marvellous machine ; the printing and numbering of the notes are performed, simultaneously, with perfect accuracy. Every note which is returned to the Bank is immediately cancelled. The Bank issues none but new notes, and thus can supply to the commercial world, whose needs it knows exactly, the notes most in demand. Another curiosity is the automatic balance which weighs the gold and rejects at once any piece which does not attain the exact standard of weight. Ten of these machines weigh between them 60,000 pieces of gold daily. The business of banking possesses, in London and throughout all England, an 6"], [54, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 42 importance of whicli one can form no adequate idea. The number of banks is very considerable. Besides the Bank of England, there are numbers of private establishments and joint-stock banks of limited liability, in which latter the liability of the shareholders is limited to the nominal original value of the shares they hold. The principal joint-stock banks are the London and Westminster, the London and County, the Union; but there are many others. The most celebrated private banks are Coutts', Childs', the Barclays', Glyn, Mills', Baring's, Hoare's, etc., and Rothschilds', of course. All these establishments, which the public can enter, are extremely well conducted. The various operations are carried on with an order and regularity, * a precision and courtesy, an obliging manner, and an absence of useless formalities, wliich astonish and charm the stranger \u2014 above all, the Frenchman, who in his own country is not treated with such politeness by public bodies. It is easy to convince one's-self of this by going to cash a cheque in any bank \u2014 no matter wliich \u2014 in London. This is, besides, the most common act which everyone performs, for the cheque plays an important part in English life. Anyone who keeps a banking account makes his payments by cheques; in business, naturally, it could not be otherwise. The number of these slips of paper is positively incalculable; so, to facilitate tlieir work, the London bankers bethought them of the Clearing House. As it would be impossible for any bank to present all the cheques it receives on the various other banks, all the drafts pass through the Clearing House, where each house has an account, and the differences in amounts are adjusted by a single payment, by a cheque on the Bank of England. The total value of the cheques which passed through the Clearing House in 1882 reached the fabulous sum of six thousand, three hundred and eighty-two millions, six hundred and fifty-four thousand pounds sterling ! We may remark here that a cheque can always be refused, it not being a \" legal tender.\" Is it not then curious to observe that the commerce of England is based upon a system of the interchange of cheques? In 1869 the figures ofthe Clearing House were only three thousand, six hundred aud twenty-six millions of pounds sterling; and, such is the prodigious development of British commerce, that this sum had nearly doubled itself in thirteen years. Such vast amounts make one's brain reel, and we find it difficult to realize them. It needs little argument to prove that with such enormous transactions the fortunes made in business must be enormous; so that some merchants enjoy an income as large as some small European states. We must remember that an English millionaire, according to the time-honoured phrase, is worth 25,000,000 francs. The number of these Cr\u0153suses is large. At their head we must place the bankers and the group of merchant princes who literally do not know in what way to use tlieir wealth. Quitting the Bank of England, we find ourselves in front of the Royal Exchange, a building in the Greco-Roman style, erected in 1844, after the designs of Mr. Tite. A Latin inscription informs us that it was built in the reign of Queen Eliz.abeth, and restored under Queen Victoria. Reconstructed would be more correct, for the old Exchange was completely destroyed by fire in 1838. The fajade presents a portico, preceded by a flight of steps, and supported by eight Corinthian columns, above which is a pediment ornamented by allegorical figures by Westmacott. The roof is surrounded by"], [55, "THE CITY. 43 a stone balustrade, which is surmounted by a clock-tower, 180 feet in height, in which is a set of chimes. Notwithstanding the trouble the architect took to conceal the chimneys, they appear out of keeping with the building, which is not suitable to the climate of London. The Exchange is entered by four doors. The principal entrance under the peristyle is surrounded by the Royal arms, sculptured by Carew. The interior of the Royal Exchange is simply a paved court of rectangular shape. In the centre is a marble statue of the Queen, by Lough, and all around is an arcade or cloister, the walls of which are ornamented with frescoes by Sang. It is here that the big-wigs of commerce and finance come every Tuesday and Friday, between three and four o'clock, to discuss and fix the rates, not of public stocks, but of merchandise and produce of all kinds. Ic is a curious custom for such soi-disant prac tical people, who have the reputation of taking their ease, to come to talk over their business in the open air, in an un sheltered place, open to all the winds of Heaven. But the old Exchange was an open place, and tradition demands that this shall be open too. As we have seen, the Royal Exchange is not the Bourse of London, in the sense in which we accept the term. The market for the public funds is in the Stock Exchange, of which we will speak later. ROYAL EXCHANGE. Lloyd's Rooms are on the first floor of the Exchange. There the insurances on ships are effected ; and there underwriters, owners, and captains of merchant vessels meet. The agents of Lloyd's are scattered in all parts of the world, and keep themselves \"posted up\" in the arrivals and sailings of ships, as well as the accidents which befal them. There are belonging to the United Kingdom 25,000 vessels, of all classes (of which 5,000 are steamers), employed in the coasting and foreign trade, and repre senting a tonnage of 6,600,000, and manned by 200,000 men. The outgoings and incomings of this enormous fleet are the transactions Lloyd's have to follow up and register with a precision and exactitude wliich is incomparable. All the information transmitted by the agents whom the society employs, in more than 1,200 seaports, are entered in admirably-kept registers, and can be consulted at any moment by the members of Lloyd's. In the open space in front of the Royal Exchange the visitor will perceive a fountain, and a bronze equestrian statue of Wellington. Behind the building a statue of Peabody, the philanthropic American, who when he died left the poor of London \u00a3240,000, is a marvel of bad taste. The sculptor has represented the philanthropist seated with crossed legs in a truly ridiculous posture. Not far from this, in Capel Court, is the Stock Exchange, or the Bourse. Contrary to the practice which obtains in France, the buying and selling operations in the public securities are completed with closed doors by agents, who are called stockbrokers, who"], [56, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 44 form a numerous body-eight or nine hundred-and are governed by a committee consisting of thirty members, elected by the subscribers. To become a stockbroker one must be introduced bv three members, who become guarantees for two years for the solvency ot the candidate in a sum of \u00a3300 each. In principle every member ought to be re-elected every year, but it need not be said that this is a simple formality. The transactions done daily on the Stock Ex change may be estimated at hundreds of millions, and the house of Roths child has been known to purchase four millions' worth of securities in one afternoon. All these operations are completed by a transfer, as nearly all kinds of stock and shares are represented by nominal certificates. In the slang of the Stock Exchange, those who operate for the rise are called bulls, and those who operate for the fall are called bears. From many a spot in the City may be perceived a high column surmounted by a gigantic gilt bronze flame; this was erected in 1671 - 77, after the designs of Sir Christopher Wren, to commemorate the Great Fire of 1666. So vivid is the recollection *- '.I COAL EXCHANGE. ,( of this terrible disaster that no particular name has been bestowed upon the column. It is The Monument \u2014 the memorial par excellence. When one has said The Monu ment, one has said everything. It is a column of the Doric order, fluted, 202 feet high from the base to the summit of the flame, which from a distance resembles an enormous"], [57, "THE CITY. 45 shaving brush. The pedestal was executed by Cibber ; the four dragons were sculptured by E. Pierce. A staircase of black marble ascends spirally in the interior of the column and leads to a platform, now covered by a cage to prevent suicides. It seems that this wise precaution, now elsewhere adopted in other columns of the kind, was rendered necessary by the number of unfortunate people who threw themselves from the summit in order to terminate their wretched lives. Those for whom existence has no longer any charms are now compelled to throw themselves into the Thames, and the list of those who are fished out of it every year is a long one. Of the old corporations which formerly monopolized various industries and manual trades some eighty still exist, but their privileges, having no locus standi, have been successively curtailed. A certain number of these bodies represent industries which have passed away, such as the Bowyers and the Barber-Surgeons. At the present time the majority of the members of these societies, or Companies, do not practise the sr-ECIMEN OF FIVE-POUND BANK-NOTI profession indicated by their titles. One only, that of the Stationers, is exclusively composed of persons belonging to that branch of commerce. These opulent Companies confine themselves to the management of their immense estates, to see to the prosperity of the pious foundations, tbe schools, and almshouses which from time to time they have erected or endowed ; and, above all things, to give feasts and banquets ! Ah ! those banquets ! how they come under our view every moment when we are writing about the City ! From time to time a man of mark in the political world, or a victorious general, or a prince, is elected a member of one of these Companies. All the members of the Royal Family belong to one or other of these Companies, and God knows to what copious libations and festivities one of these memorable elections gives rise ! One of the last elections was that of Sir Beauchamp Seymour (now Lord Alcester), who bombarded Alexandria in 1882, who was made a Cutler, first by telegraph, and afterwards by the traditional ceremonial in the beginning of 1883. There are scarcely a dozen Companies at present which possess Halls worthy of* thc name. Amongst these the Mercers, the Grocers, the Fishmongers, and the Goldsmiths"], [58, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 46 occupy the first rank. It \"goes without saying\" that the last-mentioned eclipses all the other Companies in point of luxury, from the richness of the plate exhibited on the sideboards, &c, on feast days. This Company controls and inspects all articles of Companies possess pictures and statuary, representing in most cases celebrated per sonages, members of corporations, or historical events. The Barber-Surgeons possess a grand picture by Holbein, the subject of which is King Henry VIII. granting the charter to their Corporation. This canvas has been spoiled by the suc cessive awkward attempts at re-touching, under which the original colouring has almost disappeared. A portrait of Inigo Jones, by Van Dyck, is also in the same collection. It is easy to visit the Halls of the different Companies by presenting oue's self there, or by addressing a member, for strangers are in general very courteously received. The revenues of the Companies are very large, and it is difficult to fix even approximately the figure, which must amount to a respectable number of millions. gold or silver made in England. All the We must not leave this portion of our subject without saying a few words concern ing the general commercial character of England, and the resolute energy of the British merchant, the sureness of his glance, the fertility of his mind, and, above all, his perseverance. Accustomed to depend solely upon himself, the merchant, the English business man, or manufacturer, never per mits himself to be discouraged. From his Government he demands only one thing \u2014 the liberty to manage his own affairs as he pleases, knowing that in general skdful poli ticians are not good men of business. The THE MONUMENT. commercial crisis which succeeded the prodigious development of trade in 1873, enables us to see how the English people understand their own interests. In that year the returns of trade reached the then unprecedented figure of \u00a3682,000,000 sterling \u2014\u00a3371,000,000 of imports, and \u00a3311,000,000 of exports: merchandize only, remember. It was soon perceived that this extraordinary result was due to rash specu lations, and, as a natural consequence, prices fell to such a degree that many people fancied such a condition of things could never be again reached \u2014 that business would not"], [59, "STATIONERS' HALL. GOLDSMITHS' HALL MERCERS' HALL."], [60, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 48 recover. The situation was certainly grave. The markets were glutted with foreign produce ; English manufactures had become inferior, and the result was a commercial crisis. Far from being dis couraged, this depression of trade acted on the British manufacturers like a spur. They redoubled their energies, renewed their plant, and, having improved their pro duce, beat their rivals with tlieir own weapons ; so that in 1880 the returns of im ports and exports were raised to \u00a3697,000,000, or more than \u00a315,000,000 over the totals of 1873 ! It is this indomit able energy, this tenacity, this confidence in himself, which gives the superiority to the British merchant. These are, besides, national qualities wliich are met with in all professions. Here is an anecdote typi cal of the subject : Some thirty years ago two enter prising young men started in business in the City together. DOOR OF SADDLERi' HALL. After a while their small capital was exhausted, and their credit shaken by the suggestive rumours that a financial paper thought fit to promulgate. That fact saved them. An action for libel was brought, and t3i'minated in favour of the young men, who were awarded \u00a31,000 damages. As thjir cash-box was empty, one would imagine that they hasten 3d to pay some of their del 1-3 with the money. Anyone who thinks so can have but little knowledge of the Eng' ish character. The day after the trial the Times announced that Messrs. X. Y. & Co. had given the \u00a31,000 to the London hospitals. A house that could afford to do this could not be in difficulties. Their credit was saved, that was all they wanted. To-day these jrentlemen are millionaires, and of world-wide reputation."], [61, "THE CITY. 49 VI. THE THAMES, AND THE PORT OF LONDON. \u2014 THE CUSTOM HOUSE. THE DOCKS. \u2014 ST. KATHERINE's AND THE LONDON DOCKS. \u2014 WAPPING. \u2014 THE THAMES TUNNEL. \u2014 THE TOWER SUBWAY. If the monuments of the City fall below our preconceived ideas, its commercial institutions, on the other hand, surpass all that the imagination could have pictured. It is a newly discovered world\u2014 an unknown town into which we have penetrated, which resembles nothing we have ever known, of which we shall never see the like \u2014 for it is unique on the face of the earth. In fact, what other can be compared with it ? Where can we find another Thames \u2014 the \" Silent Highway \" \u2014 which puts it in communication with the Universe ? \" All roads lead to Rome,\" says the proverb. London leads everywhere, retorts the Englishman, proud of his commercial supremacy, of his merchant marine, of his genius for bargaining, of his energetic and enterprising spirit. From London Bridge the prospect is superb. The River, two hundred and fifty yards wide, rolling its yellow and glittering waves along, is covered with vessels from all parts of the globe, and so packed, so pressed one against the other, that it is difficult for those going out or coming in to push their way through the crowd of boats of all kinds which dart across the narrow channel left in the centre of the stream. In front, as far as the eye can reach, extends a sorest of masts, a network of cordage, a labyrinth of yards and rigging which seems inextricable : a lace of a thousand patterns, of which the threads are ropes and chain cables. Beside the heavy merchantmen \u2014 great ships which have come from the Indies or Australia \u2014 the large steamers of great speed, with their narrow beams and tapering sides, make a striking contrast. It is the racehorse compared with the powerful roadster. Light and rapid the Greenwich steamers make their way amongst the heavier craft, leaving behind them a silver streak in the water, and in the air a trail of black smoke. All nations are represented below the bridge, if we may judge from the bunting displayed; but practised hands have no need to study the flags to pronounce upon the nationality of the stranger : a glance is sufficient to detect the signs imperceptible to the ordinary observer in the inclination of the masts, the cut of the sails, the \" lines \" of the hull, which, for the knowing ones, is as good as a certificate of birth and parentage. On the left are the Monument and the Billingsgate Fish Market, with its Italian campanile. Farther on is a great white building with colonnades \u2014 this is the Custom House. Farther down, still, the Tower ; then St. Katherine's Docks ; the London Docks situated above the famous tunnel of Brunei \u2014 the Thames Tunnel, now utilized by a railway company. On the right is busy Bermondsey, with its lofty chimneys, from which ascend clouds of smoke and steam, the smells of which mingle with the odours of the numerous"], [62, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 50 tanneries established on that side ofthe Thames; the Commercial Docks and the Surrey Docks are in the sharp curve which the river makes here. The continued rolling of the cabs, the sound of horses' hoofs on the stones, the puffing of many steam engines, the blows of heavy hammers, the grinding pulleys, the groaning capstans, and, above all, the voices of a million of men, unite in forming a loud roaring, which is like the roaring of the sea. The noise as of waves envelopes you ; you are clasped in its shadowy embrace, and lulled to sleep ; the ear too rapidly struck by the multiplicity of sonorous vibrations, E THAMES BELOW LONDON BRIDGE. no longer transmits any sound. You are deafened; you feel thc noise, but no longer hear it. The Port os London extends along the Thames for six and a-half miles. It is about that distance from London Bridge to the point called Bugsby's Hole; but, as a matter of fact, the frequented portion of the river does not extend below Limehouse \u2014 or the portion of the river occupied by thc East and West India Docks on one side, and by the Surrey Docks on the other. Vessels of 800 tons come up as far as this; those of 1,400 tons cannot come above Blackwall; but ships of any draught can get up as far as Woolwich. The importance of the Port of London is so great that the Custom House employs 2,000 officers. The entries and clearances of vessels number 150 a day, or 50,000 a-year, and the duties levied by the Custom House amount to the sum of \u00a310,000,000 sterling, wliich is almost half the sum paid by the whole of the United Kingdom. Liverpool \u2014 the famous port of Liverpool \u2014 only pays a sum of \u00a33,000,000 sterling annually in dues of all kinds, that is to say, only one-third of the amount paid for London dues \u2014 but as a place of export Liverpool is much more important than the metropolis."], [63, "THE CITY. 51 The vahie of the merchandise imported to and exported from London is estimated at \u00a365,000,000 sterling. Faithful to the principles of free trade, the English impose duties only upon about twenty articles of consumption; but, in fact, four articles only furnish the Revenue with \u00a320,000,000 sterling: these are wine, tea, spirits, and tobacco. Coal, it is true, whether it arrives by land or by sea, pays a tax of thirteen pence per ton as City dues to the Corporation, whose revenues are estimated from this source at \u00a3170,000 sterling. Two millions of tons of coal enter London annually, and it is said that 20,000 sailors are employed in the transport of the sea-borne coal. CUSTOM HOUSE. A visit to the Custom House will prove very interesting, if only to see the great hall, where a hundred clerks are employed in receiving the declarations of captains and shippers. For anyone gifted with perseverance, the Custom House holds in reserve an agreeable surprise \u2014 the Museum, in which the objects and articles that have been used for smuggling are exhibited. The fertility of the smuggler's imagination is positively unlimited. There is no apparently inoffensive article that has not been employed to conceal spirits, cigars, or tobacco. Sometimes it is a large folio volume, whicli conceals some dozens of cigars ; a crinoline, such as were worn formerly, the steels of which were so arranged as to receive bladders filled with excellent brandy or sherry; sometimes an oil-can with a false bottom, as used bj conjurors, is detected: or even a loaf of bread. artistically hollowed out until nothing is left but the crust; in this receptacle a pound of tobacco is placed in lieu of the extracted \" crumb.\" One must visit this collection"], [64, "52 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. to understand to what extent the inventive minds of the smugglers will lead them, and to do justice to the marvellous sagacity of the Custom-House officers who have ferreted out these tricks, which would do credit to the Red Indians. From the extensive terrace that skirts the river, the visitor can enjoy an excellent view over the river and the port of London. It was here, as related, that the poet Cowper came, with the intention to commit suicide at the time of his great distress; LONDON DOCKS. I but I workmen I he to I lodgings I dies, the I who to returned from Liverpool, ex- claims, cheerfully, \" I never so well understood the greatness of England until I saw so much soap ! \" There is truth, and a good deal of truth, in this conceit. The Anglo-Saxon people, whom Napoleon spoke of, disdainfully, as \"a nation of shop- keepers,\" are justly proud of this commercial ascendency, which makes them so strong. They are proud of it ; they glory in it, and with good reason, since it has enabled them to triumph over their enemies in the past, and will again render them the same services should circumstances call for them. What would this same character in the comedy say if he could see the extensive London Docks, which cover a superficial area of 1,000 acres; and of which docks one, and that by no means the largest, employs nearly 3,000 men daily, occupied in loading and unloading the vessels"], [65, "THE CITY. 53 in the basins ? Six of these docks are situated on the left bank, and two on the right bank ofthe river; and ii is estimated that 6,000 ships are lying in the various London docks every day in the year. The work accomplished daily in these gigantic entrepots is actually prodigious\u2014 prodigious, too, is the quantity of goods, of all kinds, which they contain. St. Katherine's Docks, being the nearest to the business centres, are for that reason those which the visitor will most willingly see. They are equally interesting as the others, even if smaller; but, being organised and arranged in a superior manner, they give one a really exact idea of the way in which the load ing, unloading, and storing of LONDON DOCKS. merchandise is carried on. A dock is composed of basins communicating with the river (in this case, the Thames), and is entered by sluice-gates, surrounded by quays, on which rise warehouses of many stories, which receive the merchandise destined for export, or which has been imported. In some docks there are no jetties, the vessels being moored close under the warehouses, so the merchandise is raised direct from the ship's hold to the storehouse. Immense cranes, worked by hydraulic pressure, lift the bales and cases to the desired floors, where the labourers seize them and stow them away, under the supervision of the clerks charged with their registration. The whole proceeding is conducted in a very"], [66, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 54 noiseless fashion and almost without speaking. Four or five days are sufficient to unload a vessel of 1,000 tons, and on special occasions, in times of pressure, the work is accomplished even more rapidly. It is on record that 1,100 barrels of tallow, each weighing nine or ten hundredweight, were unloaded in seven hours. As it would be impossible to maintain a staff sufficient to perform this Herculean labour, the dock labourers are engaged by the day, or even for the half day, according to need. So there is a miscellaneous and a strange-looking crowd every morning pressing around the dock gates. Clerks out of place, workmen out of work, ruined gentlemen, servants, old sailors, soldiers, beggars, pickpockets; in fact, all that rose that morning, without knowing where to turn for food, go to the docks, in the hope of finding some work and bread ! This is the only place, perhaps, in the world at which one can present one's self without recommendation, and be admitted. Those who cannot obtain employ ment in the morning wait in a court until the afternoon, when perhaps a fair wind will bring up a tardy vessel, and enable them to gain the fourpence per hour which is paid to the unhappy wretches who are taken on late. Seated or lying upon the benches, emaciated, ragged, there are a hundred or two hundred men seeking for a problematical morsel of bread. A gate is opened; a man \u2014 the foreman \u2014 appears. He wants six men. The crowd rushes up ; the first push themselves in. The gate is closed. A day without food ! And to think that every day there are hundreds, thousands, of human beings who have no other resource than labour at the docks ! Yes, it is there, indeed, that one sees the richness of England ; but it is there, too, that one sees the fearful misery, this leprosy, this plague-spot, this canker, whicb is eating into it, and always increasing ! What a shadow upon the picture ! It is from the docks also that emigrants proceed to America, and, above all, Australia. Attracted by the announcements in the newspapers of the promises of ship owners, what suffering do they endure on these floating-boxes called \" emigrant ships,\" the most terrible means of torture ever invented. Legislation on the subject is very wise and paternal, but a number of unscrupulous ship-owners elude with much ingenuity the provisions of the law. Notwithstanding the supervision exercised by Government Inspectors, the regulations are cleverly violated, the cabins are crowded up, the food is insufficient when it is not absolutely unwholesome, and the vessel is in as bad a condition as is compatible with its keeping afloat, at all ! But, bah ! the passage money has been paid; the vessel has been insured; what does it matter whether it founders or whether it arrives at its destination ? In either case, there is nothing to fear, for the emigrants who disembark in the antipodes make no more claims than do those who lie at the bottom of the ocean. All types of humanity are represented in the docks, and one can make the tour of the world there without any trouble, and may hear every language under the sun, from English to Tartar-manchou. All the varying shades which the human skin is capable of displaying, show themselves here as in a kaleidoscope. The white Norwegian elbows the bronzed African; the yellow Chinese, with his small eyes and long pig-tail; the thin and raw-boned Yankee, with his \"goatee\" ornamenting his chin; the Russian, the Lascar, the Malay, rush about elbowing each other, knocking against each other too; exchanging jests or fisticuffs. Sometimes a sudden gleam is seen, and then as"], [67, "THE CITY. 55 quickly disappears in the midst of a group of men. A knife has been drawn; an almost sure indication of the presence of an Italian or a Spaniard. At the cries of the wounded man, the stalwart policeman leisurely advances, calm and dignified, collars the man with the knife, and hauls him off to the police station \u2014 not without difficulty, sometimes. In case of resistance, it is all the worse for the malcontent, who receives some ugly blows, and finds himself carried face downward to the station by four strong policemen, in a position in which it is impossible to struggle. This mode of conducting a refractory prisoner is known as the \" Frog's March.\" Why ? The warehouses are full of bales, cases, and barrels. In the St. Katherine's Docks, DOCK-BASIN. the principal merchandise stored consists of tea, sugar, coffee, tobacco, grain, wool, and silk \u25a0 the total weight stored in these warehouses reaches 140,000 tons. As one passes from warehouse to warehouse, one experiences the whole \"gamut of smells,\" known and unknown, which successively salute the olfactory nerves. The aroma of tea and coffee are mingled disagreeably with the emanations from a pile of freshly-stripped hides. Here pepper and tobacco assail your throat and eyes, and you couo*h and \"sneeze your head off.\" Further on you slip on something sticky which you take for tar \u2014 it is cane-sugar, which is exuding from the barrels yonder. A stalwart porter, carrying a package, sends you flying up against a wall, from which you return blue\u2014 not with fear, but with indigo ! It is all your own fault, you should have kept a better look out! One has no time to be polite in the docks. Business"], [68, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 56 is business ; and if the sight-seer is admitted, it is on the understanding that he does not interfere with the labourers. You have nothing to complain of; as for the men there, they speak but little, by monosyllables, no cries, oaths, laughter, or singing is heard, unless from the vessels where the sailors are accompanying their work with the chants common to seamen of all nations. Here and there you will observe the watch- men or policemen, wearing the uniform of the Dock Company, which has its special police, walking about, watching carefully all that goes on; they ex change a few words with each other and resume their patrol. Indifferent as they may appear, nothing es capes them. Guardians of another species, but the use of which is evident, are the cats, of which there is quite an army in the St. Katherine's Docks ; and the keep of these four-footed auxiliaries costs about \u00a3200 a year! The superficial area of these docks is about 24 acres, in cluding the basins and warehouses. When they were about to be erected (in 18.27), it was found necessary to demolish a hospital* and 1300 houses. ST. PAUL'S AND THE THAMES ABOVE LONDON BRIDGE. The London Docks, separated from St. Katherine's by a narrow lane, are much the more extensive. Tlieir area is four times as great ; they are, like the others, enclosed within walls, and include 4 basins, 24 warehouses, 20 sheds, and 21 cellars. There are 3 sluice-gates from the river for the entry and exit of shipping. More than 300 vessels * St. Katherine's Hospital is now situated in the Regent's Park ."], [69, "THE CITY. 57 can find room at a time, but it is seldom that so many are found there at once. These docks are the great emporiums for tea, tobacco, and particularly Australian wool ; 120,000 chests of tea can be warehoused there, and 180,000 pipes of wine. As for tobacco, the quantity may be estimated from the fact that a whole basin and an immense storehouse, covering nearly 2^ acres of land, are exclusively devoted to the reception of the plant, introduced into France by Nicot, and into England by Sir Walter Raleigh. To visit the cellars it is necessary to be furnished with a special permit, called a \"tasting order,\" wliich entitles the visitor to taste the wines stored there. Accompanied by a cellar-man the visitor may, supposing his head and his legs are sufficiently strong, NATIVES OF WAPPING. pronounce upon all the vintages in the world \u2014 from Bordeaux to Australian wines, from those of the Rhine to South Africa. This experiment, from which very few people emerge unscathed, is not within the reach of everybody. Nevertheless, the number of people who are met with staggering about, having evidently considerable difficulty to preserve their equilibrium, proves that it is by no means a difficult matter to procure a \"tastino- order.\" The losses generally attributed to the bad condition of the casks are considerable. In the year 1874 the quantity of wine which evaporated amounted to 20,000 bottles ! The Wool Warehouses are the most extensive in London. The telephone and the telegraph put them in communication with the market, and with the houses of the principal brokers. These storehouses form a separate portion of the Docks, and are connected with all the lines of railway, and with the Victoria Docks lower down the river. In 1862 there had been put up for sale by these Docks alone 92,000 bales of wool. In 1881 the sales reached nearly 400,000 bales, or one-third of all the wool sold in London. The length of the landing-quays is about 5,000 yards. In the London Docks we 8"], [70, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 58 find the Queen's Pipe, which is an immense furnace of cylindrical form with a high chimney, from which escape clouds of smoke of a very persistent odour. In this \"pipe\" is consumed all the merchandise which has not paid duty, and which cannot be sold owino* to its bad condition. From one year to another the Queen's Pipe smokes away a most heterogeneous collection of articles\u2014 tobacco, hams, coffee, tea, gloves (13,000 pairs at one time), all are thrown in and burned; and as nothing is wasted, the ashes are sold bv auction to gardeners, who make an excellent manure of it, or to soap-boilers and chemical works. The old iron is put aside for the gun factories, and commands a high price for gun-barrels. It seems that this iron is of extraordinary toughness, and will stand an enormous pressure without bursting. A STREET IN WAPPING. The London and the St. Katherine's Docks belong to the same company, and fabulous profits are realized every year. The streets which surround the Docks, and in which it is scarcely prudent to venture in the evening \u2014 or, at times, by day \u2014 are some of the most strange and curious in the metropolis. Narrow and dirty, they are lined with low houses \u2014 hovels, the inhabitants of which, especially the females, defy description. The women, unkempt, tipsy, bear upon their countenances the marks of the most horrible debauchery and the most revolting vices. Wearing bonnets picked up in the streets, covered with dirty rags, but rags of staring colours, red shawls, dresses of violet or vivid green, with a bold, insolent air they go about in groups, laughing coarsely at some gross joke, or at some obscene remark cast at a passer-by. Brawls are of frequent occurrence between these females, and leave on their faces ineffaceable traces of the encounter. Of ten of these creatures there will be surely found six who have had an eye blackened, a lip split, or an ear torn off."], [71, "THE CITY. 59 As for the men, worthy companions of such harpies, they offer a spectacle of the most repulsive drunkenness and hideous depravity. Callot has never dreamed of any more atrociously cynical, more nakedly horrible, more audaciously criminal, than the hang-dog faces of these \" roughs,\" who, were it not for the wholesome fear of the police and the \"cat,\" would strangle you like a fowl and rob you. It is true that they have no hesitation in robbing you. So it is as well to leave your watch and purse behind you when visiting such places. The only shops wliich one meets are those of pawnbrokers and public houses \u2014 the alpha and omega of Wapping existence \u2014 the place where you can obtain money, and the place where you can spend it. The number of these establishments evidences the flourishing condition of these honest traders. Every sailor who lands after a voyage with well-filled pockets, immediately becomes the prey of one of those terrible women whose seductions are for him irresistible. Dragged first of all into a gin shop, copious \" drinks \" soon deprive him of his senses ; and after a tete-a- TOWER SUBWAY. tete with the syren in tatters, our sailor wakes up in a corner stupefied, rendered incapable by drink and excesses, his pockets and his head alike vacant. To diminish these occurrences as much as possible, and, at the same time, to protect the sailor himself from the lodging house harpies of the district, a Sailors' Home bas been founded, where the men are comfortably lodged and fed at a moderate sum, and protected from the pernicious influences of the \"Mollies\" and other nymphs of Wapping. It is in this direction that we find the Thames Tunnel, planned and executed by Brunei. It was commenced in 1825, and finished eighteen years after in 1843 ; tremendous difficulties had to be encountered and overcome. \u00a312,000,000 sterling were spent in this ruinous enterprise, which never has returned a penny to the unfortunate shareholders. The Thames Tunnel was in a ruinous condition when, in 1865, it was purchased for \u00a3200,000 by the East London Railway, which now runs its trains through it and brings them into direct communication with the lines north and south of London, below London Bridge (at New Cross). The Thames Tunnel is 1,200 feet long, and the top of the arch is only 1 6 feet below the bed of the river. In 1870 another communication by a sub-fluvial passage (for pedestrians) was opened by the Tower Gates. The Tower Subway is simply an iron tube seven feet in diameter,"], [72, "60 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. and 1,300 feet in length, lighted by gas, in which two men can just walk abreast. How ever, as there is no other way of traversing the stream without making a very considerable detour, this somewhat inconvenient passage is much used, particularly by working-men who are proceeding to or from their work. It is estimated that about three thousand people pass through the Tower Subway every day. VII. THE PUBLIC OFFICES. THE POSTAL AND TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENTS. \u2014 THE MINT. THE TRINITY HOUSE. The General Post-office, the head of whicb \u2014 the Postmaster-General \u2014 is one ofthe Ministry, is the only one of the great departments of the State which is located in the GENERAL POST OFFICE. City, where its place in the centre of the business quarterM is naturally defined. It is situated in St. Martin's-le- Grand, near St. Paul's, and consists of two extensive buildings specially erected for the purpose \u2014 one in 1829, the other in 1873. The former is devoted to the postal business, the latter to the telegraph administration. The older building, designed by Sir R. Smirke, presents the eternal Grecian fa?ade with columns, which is found everywhere, whether in Exchange or Bank, Custom House or Church. The interior is perfectly arranged. The public enters a vast hall 80 feet by 60, where are wickets for the various kinds of business. The simplicity of the forms to be gone through, and the"], [73, "THE CITY. 61 rapidity with which they are attended to, are really admirable. The officials endeavour to expedite business by all means in their power, and they succeed in their aim. The SPECIMENS OF POSTAGE STAMPS. clerks, courteous, obliging, correct, and quite \"up to the mark,\" are particularly complaisant, and seem fully alive to the truth, so long in making its way in France THE MINT. \u2014 that the Post-Office was invented for the public, and not the public for the Post. The work done here is immense. In 1882, the number of letters posted was more than 1,000 millions ; while the post-cards reached a total of 144 millions ; newspapers aud book packets, 318 millions. The transmission of letters and telegrams in London"], [74, "62 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. is achieved with marvellous rapidity. Thus it is possible to write to a friend in the morning, receive an answer, and to send a reply to that answer, which will be delivered the same day \u2014 making three letters exchanged between two persons in twelve hours; and this, too, within the radius of twelve miles from the head office. So complete are the postal arrangements, that there is not a house more than two hundred yards from a letter-box, or four hundred from a post-office and money-order office. There are 9,700 pillar-boxes, which are cleared every hour, from ten o'clock in the morning, until five in the evening; there are twelve deliveries in the City, and eleven sovereign. in other places. On Sundays, London is less well off than some other towns in England \u2014 there is no delivery of letters in London that dav, while in the provinces there is a morning delivery on Sunday. Why is the Londoner deprived of his correspondence one day in the week, while the provincial receives his? This is one of those unsolvable mysteries with which one is continually meeting iu this land of contrasts and anomalies. The telegraph administration, situated opposite the postal department, is accommo dated in an immense building of four storeys, without any claims to architectural beauty, but arranged in a manner eminently suited to the requirements of business. Under - ground are the electric \"piles\" and pneu matic tubes, serving for transmission of tele grams, and the steam engines. The offices are on the first floor, and the upper storeys are exclusively used for the receipt and trans mission of telegrams. The journalistic and private wires are on the second floor, the ordinary telegrams on the third. Five hundred instruments are working night and day, and occupy 1,500 employes, of whom two-thirds belong to the fair sex. HALF-CROWN PIECE. The sterner sex is chiefly entrusted with the night work, and the transmission of foreign telegrams, whicli are confided to a special staff. The number of wires radiating from the Central office is prodigious. Liverpool aloue has twenty. The Ministers, the Houses of Parliament, the Palace, the private residences of the great functionaries of State, and some other grandees have special wires, and an employe is always attached to the Queen's suite in all her travels. The total length of the telegraphic wires is about 126,000 miles, and the number of telegrams exceed 32 millions a year. The Post-office is also entrusted with the savings bank business, of which the deposits have reached to the enormous total of \u00a330,000,000. The revenue of this department, which comprises 13,000 offices for postal and telegraph business throughout the Kingdom, and employs more than 27,000 persons, is \u00a38,640,000 per annum. The profits, according to a recent statement of the Post master-General in Parliament, are, in round numbers, \u00a33,000,000 sterling. The Mint is also in the City near the Tower of London. To visit it one must be furnished with an order from the Master of the Mint, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,"], [75, "THE CITY. 63 who is very chary of his permits. The Mint was formerly in the Tower ; it is only since 1811 that the work-shops have been moved to their present site. Since the discovery of gold in Australia, and the importation of this precious metal, the Mint has issued an enormous quantity of coin. In ten years it has coined 44 millions of sovereigns, 16 millions of half-sovereigns, 14 millions of florins, 43 millions of shillings, and about 48 millions of sixpenny, four penny, and threepenny pieces. During the same period, only 80,000 half crowns have been struck off. The sovereigns and half sovereigns only are gold \u2014 the others are all silver TELEGRAPH OFFICE. coins. The bronze coinage is not struck in the Mint \u2014 it is made in Birmingham by private firms working on Government account. The face of \"Britannia\" upon the reverse of the penny pieces is the likeness of the celebrated Duchess of Richmond, \" the beautiful Stewart \" who inspired Charles II. with such a violent pas sion.

OPEN-AIR MARKETS. \u2014 THE BARONESS BURDETT-COUTTS AND COLUMBIA MARKET. London does not possess, as Paris does, central markets where any one may go and purchase his daily supplies of food. In the first place, the difficulty would be to find a space sufficiently large to store the various commodities necessary to the sustenance of such a populous city, and, had it been found, the enormous distances which would have to be traversed in order to reach a central point, would render such \" Hailes\" impossible in London. The system, besides, is repugnant to English notions : the regulations, the official intervention, the \" red tape-ism,\" the officialism, are all objec tionable to the Britisher, and the problem how to feed nearly five millions of inhabitants every day \u2014 that is to say, a population two-and-a-half times greater than that of Paris \u2014 has always been left to the initiative of private individuals, who have solved it in a most satisfactory manner. The quantity of food that London absorbs is something fabulous ; all the world contributes to satisfy the appetite of this gigantic city. Germany, Holland, the United States, and Australia send meat; France supplies wine, poultry, and eggs \u2014 of which a prodigious quantity is consumed \u2014 and vegetables ; Italy and Spain send fruits, wines, and vegetables; China, India, and America, tea, coffee, sugar, exotic fruits, pine-apples, bananas, and so on \u2014 which are as common in the streets of London at certain seasons as apples and chestnuts are in Paris, and are sold at \" surprisingly low prices,\" as the linendrapers say in tlieir announcements. Would the reader like to see what the capital of the United Kingdom consumes annually in the way of food ? Well then, here are a few statistics : \u2014 400,000 oxen, 2,000,000 sheep, 130,000 calves, 250,000 pigs \u2014 and all these, of course, without reckoning salted meats, imported \"tinned\" or \"barrelled\" comestibles. And the poultry! \u2014 4,000,000 fowls, ducks, geese, and turkeys; about as much game, and 1,300,000 rabbits ! Fish, about which the English are very dainty, plays a considerable part in the alimentation of the capital, which swallows in one year 3,000,000 salmon, 500,000,000 oysters, and 1,200,000 lobsters, with, of course, enormous supplies of soles, turbot, cod, herrings, whitebait, mackerel, and other sorts of fish, salted and dried, with shell fish of various kinds, and Crustacea. What an accumulation of victuals ! But also what a robust appetite, and what an all-pervading thirst exist ! To wash down this quantity of food London consumes"], [77, "THE CITY. 65 3,000,000 barrels of beer, 2,200,000 gallons of spirits, 70,000 pipes of wine, and the mdk of 20,000 cows. This enormous quantity of liquid is supplied by 12,000 tavern keepers aud wine-merchants, whde there are only 2,500 bakers in the whole metropolis. All the comestibles reach the public through the markets, which are vast depots situated for the most part in the City, and on the banks of the Thames, whither every morning come the retailers to purchase the supplies which they afterwards sell to their customers. The market for meat and poultry\u2014 the Central London Meat Market\u2014 is situated SMITHFIELD MARKET. in Smithfield, and is an enormous square brick and stone building, 600 feet in length by 240 wide. It is flanked by four towers, each surmounted by an octagon dome. The roof is of iron and glass, supported by ex tremely light cast-iron columns. A passage runs through the centre of the market. It is crossed at right angles by transversal alleys lined with shops. There are about two hundred of these shops, which are extremely well arranged, and in which the ventilation is so perfect that the tern- perature is always five degrees lower than the atmosphere outside in the shade. Planned like a theatre, this market is more curious underground than on the surface. The floors under the stage, to continue the comparison, are occupied in their entirety by a radway station, where half-a-dozen different lines unite, and put the market in direct communication with the provinces, with Scotland, which supplies a quantity of beef and mutton, and with the cattle markets of Deptford and Copenhagen Fields. The meat thus brought to the cellars of the market is raised by a dozen 9"], [78, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 66 hydraulic lifts, and distributed to the salesmen, who retail it to the butchers. In the early morning, between two and five o'clock, the consignments arrive; at the latter hour the inspectors have finished their examination, and then tbe sales commence. It is estimated that 200,000 tons weight of food is sold in Smithfield in the year. It is at Billingsgate Market, one side of which looks on the Thames, and the other on Thames Street, that the fish consumed in the metropolis is sold. The boats bring the fish right up to the market always at night, a proceeding not without danger, especially in the winter. Immediately the fish is disembarked, it is sold to the retail fishmongers ; and, as soon as they have carried away their purchases, the brokers, called \" bomarees,\" arrive, who carry away the remainder, leaving only the refuse. To these \"bomarees,\" who have virtually the monopoly, the small retailers are obliged to address themselves, and are compelled to pay relatively high prices. The consequence is that fish, which ought to be procured at a reasonable rate, is excessively dear. Quite different, but much more interesting, is the Flower and Fruit Market in Covent Garden, near the theatre of that name and the Strand, outside the limits of the City. The actual market was built in 1830, and belongs to the Duke of Bedford, who draws from it a yearly income of more than \u00a36,000. The central arcade is occupied by florists and fruiterers, who sell rare and early specimens of their wares. From ten in the morning until four in the afternoon, a well-dressed crowd occupies this avenue, for English ladies take great delight in going to Covent Garden to purchase flowers, which they take away with them in tlieir carriages. The scene is then charming, animated, and most picturesque. The bright hues of the spring costumes mingle with the tones of the fresh and brilliant colours of the flowers. The air, perfumed by a thousand scents, resounds with the silvery laughter of young ladies, or the merry chatter of the rosy, \" chubby \" children, who are carrying a sweet smelling harvest of flowers. The common fruits and herbs occupy the other galleries, which are curious to behold in the early morning. At seven o'clock the bustle is over, and the market and surrounding streets are given over to the sweepers. Almost all the fruiterers and florists of London are of the Jewish sect, and this is a peculiarity which strikes one at first sight ; for the children of Israel have preserved the national type in all its purity ; some of the women are of almost Oriental beauty. Like all their co-religionists, they have an immoderate love for jewellery and diamonds; so it is by no means an uncommon sight, when passing through the neighbouring streets, where the shops are nearly all occupied by wholesale dealers, to see the women in silk dresses, hats and feathers, with diamonds in their ears or on their fingers, weighing out potatoes or wrapping up oranges. To see the real people's markets, one must not go to Smithfield or to Covent Garden; we must visit certain streets in the poorest quarters. There, under no other canopy but the sky, or rather the clouds, these open-air markets are held by tacit arrangement with the police. All along the side of the pavement stands a file of barrows \u2014 small vehicles laden with the most varied and the most unappetising viands. On Saturday night, in winter time, when the streets are enveloped in fog, these movable markets, lighted by petroleum lamps, whose long flames are blown about by the wind, have, to a distant spectator, the effect of a tire. The ruddy glow, indistinct"], [79, "THE CITY. 67 and vacillating \u2014 the cries of the vendors and the murmurs of the crowd \u2014 all add to the illusion. Around these barrows press pale and ragged women, whose deep, sunken eyes and emaciated countenances take strange tones under the flaring light of the petroleum. Upon these weary faces Want has left ineffaceable marks, wherein one can read profound misery, the greatest desti f. *j\u00a3, tution \u2014 famine! Their feet in the greasy, I slippery mud \u2014 the amalgam of un mention - B.ible tilings which one never finds but in the streets of London \u2014 are shod with strips of leather; and they go out thus to purchase the Sunday's dinner, often the only meat meal of the whole week. In the folds of the shawl there is a shapeless bundle, which occasionally emits a cry : it is an infant ! The vendors, cunning and crafty, vaunt their merchandise, tout, and allure the customer ; they are obsequious if she permits herself to be tempted, insolent in the contrary case, and cruelly abusive to the poorest and the shamefaced. Why be civil to them ? They have no money ! One may often remark this trait in the English character: the exaggerated respect for anyone who seems to have money in his pocket, the most profound disdain for those whose purses are, or appear to be, empty ! They sell all kinds of things in these open-air markets \u2014 meat, cakes \u2014 such cakes ! \u2014 clothing, fruits, boots and shoes, hats, ribbons, flowers. There is a good"], [80, "68 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS, business done in these last-named productions, as well as in brass jewellery, in tin or pewter, a penny a set \u2014 ear-rings, brooch, and ring. The young workgirl, the third rate servant, never goes home on Saturday night without having purchased something in the way of ornament. She has no shoes or linen perhaps, but she must have a feather in her hat ; her dress is in rags, but she mounts a ribbon of vivid hue and wears gloves. There is another thing to be remarked. No one has ever succeeded in establishing a proper market \u2014 a well-conducted market\u2014 in workmen's quarters. Many attempts have been made with this end, but always unsuccessfully. In 1869, Baroness Burdett- Coutts, a lady well known for her inexhaustible wealth, and the noble uses to which she has applied it, caused an excellent market to be established in Bethnal Green, which cost her .\u20ac200,000. No one ever went into it. The buyers and sellers preferred the street. Thinking to do good, Lady Burdett-Coutts made a gift of Columbia Market to the Corporation of London, who did not turn it to any better account, and, as a last resource, returned the market to its noble proprietor. Columbia Market is always \"to let.\" So the same fact is continually recurring. No new \"people's\" market can be established in London !

LINCOLN'S INN FIELDS, AND THE LAWYERS. \u2014 THE WEST-END. INDUSTRIAL LONDON. The different quarters of London have each a well-marked individuality, and indicate by their appearance the profession of those who frequent them. To the east of Trafalgar Square, extending as far as the City boundary, is the Strand, dotted on each side with many theatres, which is in the evening an animated and noisy street, and with its perspective of lighted gas, recals, in a measure, the old Boulevard du Temple in Paris. Out of it, hard by, are Covent Garden, and the Opera House; Drury Lane and its celebrated Theatre, where grand spectacular pieces have usurped the legitimate drama : where Garrick, Kean, Macready, and Mrs. Siddons have been succeeded by the third rate actors, the ballet girls, the supernumeraries, and the clown. In the neighbouring streets, too, there are scarce any but theatrical hair-dressers, costumiers, and librarians. One jostles with a special class of people. Men with shaven"], [82, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 70 chins, pale and weary faces, chat in groups in the tones and postures peculiar to theatrical people ; women daintily tripping along, a roll of paper or book in hand, run to rehearsal, with a saucy air, a bold look, and a suggestive demeanour. Here, recognizable by their costume, their manner of walking, and their high-pitched voices, are the Italian choristers, whose volubility of speech, and vivacity of gesture, contrast with the short speeches and the stiff heavy manner of the Englishmen. Further west, in the precincts of Lincoln's Inn Fields, are to be seen individuals in ENTRANCE TO LINCOLN'S INN (CHANCERY LANE). white wigs (clothed in long black robes which cover, but do not conceal their coats and trousers) carrying briefs through the streets. These gentlemen are \"barristers,\" who have been located in this quarter from time immemorial ; they are proceeding from their chambers to the Law Courts adjacent. On the other side of Holborn is Bloomsbury. Here are few shops and little noise : long streets and spacious squares, in which the passers-by, comparatively few in number, are to be met laden with papers and books ; men, and women too, proceeding to the great building enclosed by a high railing \u2014 the British Museum. This is the district for"], [83, "REGENT STREET"], [84, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 72 literary and scientific men and students who read at the museum, or go through the curriculum of University College, or of the North London Hospital. Thence, to the West End\u2014 that is to say, to the most elegant shops, and to the streets and squares inhabited by the rich \u2014 is but a step. AH the world knows the names of the two principal thoroughfares in which is centralized all the \"luxury of trade\" of the British Metropolis\u2014 Oxford Street and Regent Street. The former, under different names, extends almost in a straight line from the City to Notting Hill ; the latter, which bisects it, has, for its extreme points, Trafalgar Square in the south, and ENTRANCE TO LINCOLN'S INN (LINCOLN'S INN FIELDS). the Regent's Park in the north; in the angle they make is found the West End properly so called. Both of them, lined throughout the length with luxurious emporiums, whose windows are rather too crowded for good taste, offer one of the most picturesque sights imaginable. On the wide pavements an elegant and leisurely crowd lounges, stopping every moment before some jeweller's, milliner's, or drapery establishment. The men, somewhat stiff, but of a stiffness devoid of haughtiness, would be models of elegance were it not that the colours of their neck-ties are somewhat too accentuated. The ladies, clad in fur, silk, velvet, or satin, are"], [85, "THE WEST-END. 73 dressed in the latest fashion; but there is invariably something which is not in harmony with the general effect: a too pronounced hat, some \"loud\" colour, or gloves of too bright a shade. Almost all are dressed in the same style like a uniform. One can see that the dressmaker rules them despotically, that they purchase their elegance ready made, without giving it the stamp of personality, or of individual taste, lacking which, a woman is never well dressed. If one may credit the costumes, there are no old women in England; and it is pitiable to see respectable grandmothers and dignified matrons dressed like young girls in bright colours and \"poke\" bonnets. HOLBORN VIADUCT. The streets are crowded with carriages emblazoned with crests and coats of arms, drawn by splendid horses, and driven by coachmen of irreproachable style and \" turn out.\" Where do the English obtain this unique race of servants of all classes which one sees in no other country ? As a contrast to all this luxury, all this elegance, and all these liveries, the side-walks are dotted with \" sandwich-men,\" who file along between two placards, one behind, one in front, human waifs and strays who have reached the lowest step on the social ladder, and who, for a shilling a day, walk about for ten hours in rain and sunshine. Some, dressed so as to suggest the title of some theatrical piece, promenade gravely in black cloaks and Spanish sombreros \u2014 these are the announce ments of the \"Manteaux Noirs,\" a comic opera, founded on \"Giralda;\" others are clothed in prison-garb, and led by a gaoler in uniform \u2014 these are the advertisers of \" Fourteen Days;\" others again are children clad in yellow to represent the \"Yellow Dwarf,\" then in"], [86, "74 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. being played at the Alhambra. It is impossible to carry realism further than this ! At many street corners, you will encounter a poor wretch, broom in hand, who sweeps a clean space across the roadway, so that passers-by may cross without soiling their boots. Kneeling by the iron street posts are little fellows, clad in red serge tunics, offering their services \u2014 brush in hand. These are the boys of the Shoeblack Brigade, otherwise \" Shoeblacks.\" A chorus of deafening cries resounds on all sides; it is a terrible hubbub, in which the street vendors take tlieir parts ; little flower-girls, clad in rags, but wearing hats and feathers; beggars selling matches as an excuse for mendicity, three-parts naked under their filthy rags ; newspaper-sellers, crying at the tops of their voices the special edition of the Globe or Echo, pursue the passers-by ; and each vies to be the loudest. Perched upon the footboard3 of tlieir vehicles, the omnibus conductors, who are endowed with the voices of Stentors, shout out then- destinations and the price of the ride. Overbearing all, a \" piano- organ,\" played by two Italians dressed in native costume, throws a note of music into the chorus and a bit of colour into the picture, the prevailing tint of which is a particular shade of cloudy grey. There are very few soldiers in the crowd, but here and there one catches sight of a gigantic Life-Guardsman in his scarlet jacket, mounted on a pair of stilt-like legs, SHOEBLACK AND SANDWICH-MEN. I, his hair well greased, his forage cap set jauntily on the side of his head, stalk- I ing along with the air of a conqueror, swinging the light cane\u2014 without which no British soldier would venture to appear in the streets ; or again, perhaps we may espy a Highlander in a kilt, with naked knees- a sight which causes nurses and street boys to turn round and stare\u2014 who apparently has no fear that some unlucky gust of wind will cause him to offend the modesty of the pretty young promenaders. A very curious type is the \"masher.\" The \"masher\" is a young \"swell\" of a very pronounced style and of a peculiar species. He wears a cut-away coat, buttoned high up to a coachman's tie, and decorated almost to his chin with a bouquet of bright flowers. His lower limbs are in outrageously tight trousers, his feet in boots pointed like needles and lustrous as the sun in heaven. He carries in his right eye a glass, which troubles him terribly to see through, and causes him to make an ugly grimace. This nppearance is topped by a bat with wide and uprising brim. The supreme"], [87, "THE WEST-END. 75 happiness of this creature is to walk along with his elbows stuck out like a vase with st. Paul's (from ludgate hill). two handles, aud to hold a cane with the handle downwards. The \"masher\" is a remarkably clumsy being, and fancies himself a \"Ph\u0153nix.\" In the evening he goes"], [88, "LONDON AND ITS ENVISONS. 76 to the theatre where burlesques are played\u2014 sports a dress-coat, and makes himsell conspicuous by his \" bad form \" and his air of deplorable affectation. In holiday time we encounter boys draped in a long blue tunic, which falls to their heels, knee breeches, and bright yellow worsted stockings, white bands, a leathern strap girdle, and shoes with buckles\u2014 a costume of the Middle Ages, imposed on the pupils of Christ's Hospital by the founder. The head-dress is so clumsy that no one nas dared to iorce tnem to wear it ; aim, as no other has been devised, the simple plan of letting the lads go without any head-covering has been adopted. As one advances westwards, after passing Bond Street, the shops begin to get fewer, and private houses take their places. The squares and the streets present a cold and severe ap pearance, which is not without a certain dignity. There are few pedestrians in this neighbourhood, where vehicles abound, and which is not ani mated except during the three summer months, which include what is termed the \" Season\" in London. At that period there is a hurrying to and fro, a never-ceasing movement ; balls and evening parties succeed each other incessantly for ten weeks and finish suddenly about the 20th to the 25th of July. After the latter date, anyone who claims to be in \" the world \" must have left London, under penalty of losing the consideration which attaches to those who move in society, if he do not. This \" Society \" \u2014 that is to say, all those people who have a name, a title, or official posi tion\u2014is located in the neighbourhood of Hyde Park, and can be circumscribed within a mile radius, taking the bridge over the Serpentine as a centre. Beyond this inner circle other con- LIFE-GUARDSMAN. centric zones extend, losing their aristocratic character accordingly as they become more distant, just as circles in the water extend and disappear after a stone has been thrown into a pond. The official world \u2014 Parliament, the Ministers \u2014 have monopolized the ancient city of Westminster, the portion of the metropolis comprised between St. James's Park and the Thames, on the bank of which river stand the Houses of Parliament, flanked by two lofty towers. If we now cross to the right bank of the river, we shall find ourselves in a town as different from the two already mentioned as if they were a thousand leagues away. The fine quays are replaced by warehouses, and the heavy craft moored at the basements of"], [89, "THE WEST-END. 77 these store-houses await their freights to carry them down stream beyond London Bridge, where they will be trans-shipped into some of the numerous vessels lying in the Pool. No monuments here ! no stately mansions ! \u2014 but high chimneys of work shops and manufactories. On this side of the river we meet, beginning at thc east end, Bermondsey, with its tanneries and hide market ; then the Borough ; then Southwark, in which we find the famous Barclay and Perkins' Brewery, one of the curiosities of London, and the Hop Exchange; then Lambeth, the great district of workshops, wherein they make machinery as in Leeds, and pottery as in Staffordshire. In the midst of this populous quarter is one palace, that of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Primate of England, standing in a large park. On this side of the water, also, we find the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. George. More to the southward, again, are the outlying districts of Camberwell, Brixton, and Wandsworth, inhabited in a great measure by middle-class householders and clerks, as the modest houses which line the almost interminable roads testify.

SOMERSET HOUSE. The word palace implies an idea of luxury, magnificence and splendour \u2014 attributes which are absolutely deficient in the three Royal residences in London. For this reason, perhaps, they are deserted by the Queen of England, who only makes short and rare visits to her capital, preferring to live at the beautiful castle of Windsor, or at the more unassuming and agreeable residences at Osborne, in the Isle of Wight, and Balmoral, in Scotlaud. Buckingham Palace, at the end of St. James's Park, was purchased from the Duke of Buckingham in 1761, by George IIL, and rebuilt in 1825, after the designs of Nash, by order of William IV., who, however, never lived in it. In 1837, the Queen came there, and finding it too small for her, added a new wing, which looks on to the Park,, and forms the principal facade of the edifice. The palace is built in a heavy and ungraceful style, and possesses three large arched gates opening into a quadrangle ornamented with columns of the Doric order, and with statues. The vestibule is surrounded by a series of columns of Carrara marble, each hewn from a single block, the bases and capitals being gilded. The grand staircase\u2014 the steps of wliich are of white marble\u2014 is decorated by Gruner and Townsend. The Throne Room, sixty-five"], [90, "78 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. feet long, hung with striped crimson silk, is very magnificent. The throne is placed on a dais of velvet of the same colour enriched with gdding. The ceiling is embossed with escutcheons and heraldic devices. Round the room is a frieze of white marble with bas reliefs, by Bailey, which represent various incidents in the Wars of the Roses. In the Picture GaUery are a number of paintings of the Dutch School of great value. The BUCKINGHAM PALACE (FROM THE GARDENS). most beautiful of the reception rooms is the Yellow Drawing-room, the furniture of which is covered with striped yellow satin, the woodwork being elaborately carved \u2014 a marvel of taste and elegance. Attached to the palace is a garden of about forty acres, enclosed by a wall, and remarkably well kept. In it are a lake, a charming summer-house, with minarets, and adorned with frescoes, and a chapel. St. James's Palace is in Pall Mall, at the bottom of St. James's Street. It is a sombre building formed of irregular blocks of houses, badly joined, with court-yards and narrow passages, and without free access of air. Of the palace erected by Henry VIII., on the site of a hospital for lepers, there remains scarce anything but the gate-house and turrets which face St. James's Street,"], [91, "79 THE WEST-END. built, it is said, after designs by Holbein. The other portions of the building have been restored so many times that it is not easy to describe the original appearance of the palace. In 1814, the Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, and Blucher were lodged in the Palace of St. James. The Queen never stays there, but levees are held there by buckingham palace from st. James's park; the Prince of Wales; drawing-rooms, and other functions, which are held by Her Majesty in person, and by the Prince and Princess of Wales, on her behalf, take place at Buckingham Palace. The apartments do not recommend themselves either by their luxuriousness or by the objects of art contained in them. There is one historical souvenir visible ; in the old Presence Chamber a chimney piece bears the interlaced initials H. A. (Henry and Anne Boleyn) surrounded by a \" true lover's knot.\" Every morning at a quarter to eleven, the guard mounting takes place at the"], [92, "80 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. palace ; and while the sentries are relieved the band plays a choice selection of music, to the great delight of the crowd, which is always considerable. Many of the apartments of St. James's Palace are inhabited by members of the Royal Family. Marlborough House, at the side, looking into the Park, has been the town residence of the Prince of Wales since his marriage in 1863. A high wall conceals part of this mansion \u2014 we cannot call it palace \u2014 erected by Sir Christopher Wren in 1710 for the celebrated Duchess of Marlborough, and purchased by the Crown in 1817 for the Princess Charlotte; and her husband, Leopold \u2014 later King of the Belgians \u2014 who became a widower after a few months, lived in it alone for many years. Badly situated, KENSINGTON PALACE. with a very inconvenient entrance, Marlborough house is scarcely a suitable dwelling for the heir to the throne of Great Britain. Kensington Palace is a massive brick budding, situated at the western extremity of Kensington Gardens; the upper portions of the edifice are after the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. In this palace Queen Victoria was born, and here she held her first CouncU. A few years ago the collection of pictures of the German school, which had been collected by Prince Albert, was moved to other palaces, and there is not much to be seen in the palace, the interior of which contains nothing of interest. Whitehall Palace is situated in the fine, wide thoroughfare which leads from Trafalgar Square to the Houses of Parliament, and to which it has given its name. There is no trace remaining of the old Palace of Henry VIII., which was destroyed"], [93, "THE WEST-END. 81 by fire in 1691. James II. wished to build a magnificent building on the site\u2014 a palace worthy of the Kings of England; and he caused a design for it to be made by Inigo Jones, of which one portion, the Banqueting House, still standing, was actually finished. This is called Whitehall Palace. The exterior of the building presents a two-storied facade, lighted by windows separated by pillars of the Ionic and Corinthian orders, terminated by a roof whicli is ornamented by a balustrade. Tbe interior, con verted into a chapel by George I., is 111 feet in length and 55 feet in height. The ceding, painted by Rubens in 1635, represents the apotheosis of James I. It is said that ST. james's palace. Jordaens assisted Rubens, and that Van Dyck executed the frescoes on the walls. Above the entrance gate is a very good statue of James I., in bronze, by Le Seur. From one of the windows of Whitehall Charles I. passed to the scaffold. Cromwell occupied the palace after the King's death, and died there in 1658. At the southern extremity of the street is a fine open space in which are several monuments : here, also, are the Houses of Parliament. This magnificent edifice, situated upon the left bank of the Thames, a few paces from Westminster Abbey, is the most beautiful structure in London. The old Parliament House was destroyed ll"], [94, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 82 by fire in 1834; and the present building was commenced from the designs of Sir Charles Barry, in 1840. The principal front facing the Thames, from which it is separated by a terrace 36 feet wide, is 300 yards long. It is divided into five unequal portions, of which the two extremes are projecting, and which are separated by pointed turrets.

This room opens into the Victoria Gallery, which is also decorated with frescoes of historical subjects, and leads into the Prince's Chamber, in which is a beautiful group, by Gibson, representing Queen Victoria between Justice and Mercy. Here we notice, also, a series of portraits of the Sovereigns of the Tudor dynasty and some splendid wood carvings. The ceiling is of surpassing richness of decoration. The Prince's Chamber opens directly into the House of Lords. The entrance to the House is through Westminster Hall, which was erected by"], [95, "HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT (FROM THE THAMES)."], [96, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 84 William Rufus in 1100, and restored\u2014 some authorities say rebuilt\u2014 by Richard II., 200 years later. The beautiful Gothic nave is the largest of its kind, in which the roof is of a single span. The oak wood-work which supports tbe roof springs gracefully from the friezes of the wall, and forms a Gothic curve of surprising lightness. Delicate carvings add to the beauty of this roofing, representing angels bearing escutcheons; and arabesques are twined around the beams. All this series of Gothic ornamentation, of the most inexhaustible fancy of design, is in most exquisite taste. At the end of Westminster Hall a flight of steps leads to St. Stephen's Hall, a long corridor lined with statues of celebrated statesmen and Parliamentary orators\u2014 Hampden, Clarendon, Walpole, Chatham, Fox, Pitt, Grattan, etc. , and, abutting on the Central HaU, an King Street Gate (demolished).

Thc Upper Chamber is in the form of a double cube, being exactly twice as long as it is wide. It is lighted by twelve windows, six on each side, the glass in which represents the Sovereigns of England. At dusk these windows are lighted from without. At each extremity of the chamber, in the arched panels, are frescoes by English artists, representing various historical, legendary, or allegorical subjects. The statues which will be observed in the niches are those of the Barons who forced King John to sign the Magna Charta. Beneath the windows extends a light gaUery, supported by a cornice ornamented with the coats of arms of sovereigns, lord chancellors, and bishops. The ceiling is sunk, and is ornamented with emblematical designs, devices, and monograms, amongst which, between the lilies of France and the lions of England and Scotland, we perceive the sun of the house of York and the grenade of Castille."], [97, "THE WEST-END. 85 The throne is in the upper end of the chamber ; immediately to the right of it is the Prince of Wales's chair. The Woolsack, on which the Lord Chancellor sits, is almost in the centre, and covered with crimson cloth. To the right and left, throughout the length of the chamber, are the benches of the Lords raised in tiers. The richness and magnificence of the decorations of the House of Lords present one of the most beautiful sights one can see in London ; when the Peers are assembled the coup d'\u0153il is really splendid. The sittings commence at five o'clock, and usually continue for two hours, for the Lords do not care for lengthy debates, and, having no constituents to please, only speak when they have something to say. The tone of the Upper Chamber is not the same as that of the Commons ; and any such member who has been elevated to the Peerage soon finds himself out of his element if he change it not. For instance, Lord Sherbrooke has no longer the aggressive manner of Mr. Lowe, and Mr. Disraeli effaced himself somewhat behind Lord Beaconsfield. Each Peer speaks from his place, and addresses himself to his colleagues. The Lord Chancellor presides, but the House itself interprets and applies its rules. The votes are expressed by the French words, content and non content ; and the French language is also employed in other cere- monies and formalities in the British Parlia ment. It is in this way the Royal assent is given to the laws passed by the two chambers by the words, La reyne le veult. As we have said, the debates in the House of Lords are generally without incident. One can, however, recall some memorable sittings. Such was that of the 7th April, 1779. On that day Lord Chatham, who was in a dying state, caused himself to be brought to the House of Lords to speak against the motion ofthe Duke of Richmond to recognize American independence. After the Duke had replied, Chatham rose a second time to speak, but before he had pronounced another word he fell fainting into the arms of the Duke of CLOCK TOWER (HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT). Cumberland and Lord Temple. Carried home and attended wth the greatest solicitude, he lingered for a month without ever completely recovering his speech, and succumbed at length to the malady that assailed him. What a stirring scene, and what a glorious ending to the career of a statesman on whom death had already laid his heavy hand, but whom he could not prevent from doing his duty to the very end ! The performance of duty as such is the dominating trait in the British character. Chatham died while doing his \" duty,\" and Nelson's last signal to the fleet as he was going into action was, \" England expects every man to do his duty ! \" The House of Commons, in its arrangement, reminds us of the House of Lords."], [98, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 86 It is as wide, but not so long, and the decoration is by no means so lavish. The windows are composed of ordinary glass, and the walls are panelled with carved oak. The benches are arranged as in the other Chamber, but the centre is open, and the Speaker's chair occupies the place of the throne. There are 670 members, and as there are only seats for 476, the remaining 194 members are obliged to accom modate themselves as best they can. In front of the Speaker is the table of the clerks of the Parliament, on which is laid the Mace \u2014 the symbol of the Sovereign's authority, and without which the Chamber cannot proceed to business. When the Commons are sitting the Mace is upon the table, but underneath it when the House is \"in Committee.\" When the Speaker leaves the Chair the Serjeant at Arms precedes him with the emblem which Cromwell dis- dainfully characterized as \" that Bauble.\" The authority of the Speaker is abso- lute, and his word is law. When a member continues to be out of order, the Speaker \" names \" him \u2014 that is to say, calls him by his name. By a recog- nized custom, which evades all personality, the representative is designated as the Hon. Member for So-and-so. In the last century a Member of Parliament was interrupted by the Speaker, who threatened to \" name \" him. \" And what will happen then, Mr. Speaker ? \" inquired the recal- citrant one. \" God knows ! \" replied the Speaker. Such was the respect for the President that no provision had been made for any case in which it would be necessary to employ more energetic measures. The Ministers and the Ministerialist party sit at the right hand of the Speaker, the Opposition on the left. The Leader of the Opposition has great authority, and one might almost call him the STATUE OF RICHARD C\u0152UR DE LION. Minister of the Opposition, so important a part does he play in the Parliamentary life of the country. He is known as the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition. There is no \" tribune \" in the House, and the Members speak from their places, a fact which does not militate against good speaking. They address the Speaker, not the Members. The other Members sit, hats on brows, in various attitudes, listenino- or sleeping. That is what Lord North, the Prime Minister of George IIL, often did,"], [99, "THE WEST-END. 87 during the delivery of his opponent's speeches. In the course of one debate, an orator as indefatigable as wearisome, entered into a history of naval construction, commencing with Noah's Ark. Sir Grey Cooper, a colleague of Lord North, accidentally aroused his chief. \" Where is he now ? \" inquired the Prime Minister, rubbing his eyes. \" In the reign of Elizabeth,\" was the reply. \" Why did you not let me sleep a century or two longer ? \" said North, as he disposed himself to continue his interrupted slumber. As the sittings commence at four in the afternoon, and are often continued far into the night, sometimes until four or five o'clock in the morning, the honourable Members who give way to slumber are not so blam able as one might first be inclined to imagine. As for the Ministers who, having passed the night in the House and thc day in their offices, content themselves during more than six months in the year with only a few hours' rest in the day, they must be gifted with a strength and energy which is not common to man. To attend a sitting of the House, it is necessary to obtain a pass signed by a Member of Parliament. In theory, the sittings are secret ; but by a curious fiction, the presence of strangers is supposed not to be known in the House. Quite recently it was regarded as sufficient for a Member to call the attention of the Speaker to the presence of strangers to ensure their withdrawal. The reporters have a gallery to themselves above the Speaker's chair. A species of cage is reserved for ladies, who, since 1738, have been rigorously relegated to the doors of the House; but \" accommodations \" can be made with Parlia- ment, and this ingenious method has bee devised, on the Turkish system, to permit English women to contemplate their law- VICTORIA TOWER (HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT). givers. This little gallery is packed on occasions of important debates. The British House of Commons has certainly not degenerated. Gladstone, Bright, Hartington, Chamberlain, Parnell, are the worthy successors of Pitt, Canning, John Stuart Mill, Peel, Brougham, Disraeli; of Disraeli, that wonderful genius, whose first efforts were so discouraging, and who, by the unaided force of his brain, succeeded in bringing to his feet those who had laughed at him so pitilessly ; and to whom, as he accepted the challenge and picked up the gage, he addressed the prophetic words \u2014 \" I now sit down, but the time will come when you shall hear me.\" From Parliament to the Ministerial Departments of State is but a step, for nearly all of them are in close proximity to the Houses, in the street called Whitehall \u2014 so named from the Palace which is therein situated. Ministers who wish to be present at the debates are thus within easy call, and are enabled during the sittings to obtain any information they may require with great promptitude."], [100, "88 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. This is an opportune moment to glance at the strange \"monument\" which is called the British Constitution, simply composed of traditions and precedents, the working of which is so perfect as a whole (notwithstanding the apparent confusion of the various component parts) , as to be a continued source of astonishment to strangers. In France, one speaks of the \" machinery \" {rouages) of the administration, and no term can be more applicable, for the French organization is an admirably conducted machine, all parts of wliich are set in motion by a single motor; but, as in all machines, when one portion gets out of order the whole ceases to work. The English administration on WESTMINSTER HALL. the contrary is a mosaic, made up of numerous pieces of different forms and colouring, some ancient, some modern, which can be changed at will, and replaced by new bits, to meet the exigencies of the moment, without disarranging the completeness of the whole fabric, thanks to the solid framework which sustains it all. This framework is Parliament. If we remember that \" the distinctive characteristic of the English people is anomaly,\" as Mr. Matthew Arnold says, we shall understand better how the English, impatient of systematic restrictions, opposed to constraint and paperasserie, have built up of shreds and patches the surprising edifice which is called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. We shall no longer be astonished at this melange of laws ancient and modern, at these customs of a former age, preserved down to the closing years of the 19th Century, and of which the 20th Century will not see the end. All this, from the French point of view, is wanting in logic \u2014 in system. But your"], [101, "THE WEST-END. 89 Englishman does not pretend to be logical, he rather avoids it, preferring to preserve the old tree of his traditions, while lopping off all dead branches, and grafting on it the new \" cuttings \" of wliich it has need. He knows that a tree requires a long time to grow up, and that when one roots up an old oak the whole garden is disturbed. HOUSE OF LORDS. The United Kingdom is under a limited monarchy ; that is to say, that, contrary to the Sovereigns of divine right, the English monarchs occupy the throne on certain conditions, the non-performance of which would entaU their downfall. The Government is composed of the three estates of the realm, which are the Sovereign, the House of 12"], [102, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 90 Lords, and the House of Commons. These three estates co-operate m the making of the laws The other powers belong exclusively to the Sovereign who is nevertheless not responsible. The responsibility for his or her acts rests with the Royal advisers. These a e the members of the Privy Conned, of which the Cabinet forms a portion By one of those strange anomalies of which England affords so many examples, the Cabinet, which, in reality, rules the country, has no poli- tical existence recognized by the Constitution, and no Act of Parliament mentions it ! It is composed of at least nine members, but often contains fourteen or fifteen. The head of the Cabinet is called the Premier. The titles of the principal Ministers of the Crown are as follows : \u2014 The First Lord of the Treasury (whose functions are almost always performed by the Prime Minister), the Lord High Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Then come the Secretaries of State for the various departments, namely, the Home Department, Foreign Affairs, Colonies, War and India. The Navy is ad ministered by the Board of Admiralty, presided over by the First Lord ; Commerce is repre sented by the President of the Board of Trade; tbe Postal and Telegraph Departments by the Postmaster- General. There are, besides, certain State functionaries, who, though attaining the rank of Ministers, have not seats in the Cabinet; such as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Field-Marshal Commanding-in- Chief, and many others. It will be noticed that there is no Minister of Justice in England. The law emanates from the Sovereign, and STATUE OF LORD DERBY (PARLIAMENT SQUARE). does not depend upon any departmental power a priceless guarantee for the independence of the Magistracy. AU the Ministers who must sit in Parliament are assisted by Under-Secretaries, selected from the Lower House if the Minister is in the Upper House, and from the Upper House if the Minister sits in the Commons. Besides, there is in every depart ment, in order to ensure the perfect expedition of business and a uniform system of procedure, a high official called a Permanent Secretary, whose position is not affected bv a change of Ministry. The advantages of this system are so evident that it is needless to dwell on them. Going from the Houses of Parliament to Charing Cross, we pass the chief Govern-"], [103, "THE WEST-END. 91 ment Departments, which we will mention in succession, while broadly indicating their respective attributes. We first perceive a building in the Italian style, with a flat roof, embellished by pinnacles, which shelters the Home, Colonial, Indian, and Foreign Offices. The first-named, or Home Office, only dates its existence from 1801 ; it was formerly amalgamated with those of Foreign HOUSE OF COMMONS. Affairs and the Colonies. It has to deal with the interior administration of the kingdom, the inspection of manufactories, workshops, mines, and fisheries. As its name indicates, the Colonial Office administers the affairs of the numerous British possessions scattered over the globe, and needs no special description. The India Office only dates from 1858, when it superseded the celebrated East India Company, which no longer exists. The Minister at the head of this department controls the acts of the Viceroy of India. He is assisted by the CouncU of India,"], [104, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 92 which is composed of fifteen Members, nominated for ten years. We may remark that, since the institution of the telegraph and rapid communication, the Viceroy of India has lost much of his former power, and is only, so to speak, the subordinate of the Secretary of State for India. The Foreign Office performs the same business as the corresponding departments of other nations. It occupies the northern angle of the building, and one side looks into St. James's Park. A large gateway gives admittance to the Grand Court, which is surrounded by buildings of a simple but imposing style. A fine marble staircase leads to the audience and reception rooms, sumptuous apartments magnificently decorated, in which the Minister holds his official receptions, and gives balls and FOREIGN OFFICE (GRAND COURT). splendid entertainments. It is at the Foreign Office that the Cabinet generally meets. Immediately facing the entrance of the Foreign Office, in Downing Street, is the very unpretending residence of the Prime Minister. Passing Downing Street we find the Treasury, an old building ornamented by a new facade. The Treasury was formerly under the direction of the Lord High Treasurer, but since 1612 his functions have been discharged by a commission of five members, amongst whom are the First Lord of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The First Lord of the Treasury (generally the Prime Minister) controls the nominations made by his coUeagues ; he appoints the archbishops and the bishops, and occupies a preponderant position in the Ministry. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has the management of the State finances,"], [105, "THE WEST-END. 93 prepares the Budget, and generally performs the duties of Finance Minister. From official documents it appears that the receipts of Englaud to the 31st March, 1882 \u2014 (the accounts are made up on the 31st March, a relic of the \" old style,\" the Gregorian calendar not having been adopted in England until 1751), \u2014 amounted to \u00a385,800,000, and the outgoings to \u00a385,470,000. In the receipts the income-tax gave \u00a310,000,000, the customs \u00a319,000,000, and the excise \u00a327,000,000. At the same period the National Debt was \u00a3762,000,000 sterling, and the interest paid nearly \u00a330,000,000. In 1817 thc debt amounted to \u00a3880,000,000 sterling, so the National Debt has been considerably reduced since that time. Not far from the Treasury are two mounted sentries of the Horse Guards or Life Guards at the gate of the FOREIGN OFFICE (from st.

The arch, which possesses no architectural beauty, is surmounted by a heavy lantern."], [106, "94 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. Thence to the Admiralty is but a step. Were not an anchor sculptured above the entrance, one would hardly think that such a department \u2014 the most important of all in England \u2014 could be installed in such a very modest building. The Admiralty, whose chief was formerly the Lord High Admiral, is now ruled by a Commission of five Members, who are entitled Lords of the Admiralty. Of these five, two \u2014 the first and fifth \u2014 are Civil Lords ; the three others are Naval Lords \u2014 officers. The First Lord only is a member of the Cabinet. The British Navy is a permanent insti tution \u2014 that is to say, its legal existence has been recognized and established by various Acts of Parliament, in contradis tinction to the Army, which, as we shall see further on, is only \" provisionary,\" and renewable annually. The Navy estimates for 1882-3 reached the sum of \u00a311,155,909 sterling ; the effective strength was 35,000 men ; and the number of ships in commis sion in December, 1882, was 214. The British Fleet at this time of writing consists of 52 armoured vessels, to which will soon be THE TREASURY. added four new ones already launched, and six others stdl on the stocks. The men enlist voluntarily. The Naval Reserve is composed of Volunteers from the Merchant Marine, who every year pass a certain time in men-o'-war. The Reserve numbers about 20,000 men. Lastly, the corps of Royal Marines forms two divisions \u2014 the Marine Infantry and Marine Artillery, the effec tive strength of which is 14,000 men. For some years the Coast Guard has been incorporated in the naval forces, and forms a corps of 4,300 men, whose business it is to prevent smuggling. THE ADMIRALTY. The AVar Office is in Pall MaU, and with the Horse Guards shares in the administration of the Army. In the court in front of the War Office is a statue of Lord Herbert of Lea, better known as Sidney Herbert, who introduced into the army long-desired reforms, with which his name will always remain associated."], [107, "THE WEST-END. 95 The Secretary of State for War is entrusted with the direction of the organization of the Army ; he is assisted by the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, whose offices, formerly at the \" Horse Guards,\" are now attached to the War Office in Pall Mall. The Minister for War fixes the annual contingent, prepares the Army estimates, sees to the formation of the troops in war time, and selects the officers who are to command them. Besides, all the nominations have to be submitted to him before they are brought before the Sovereign \u2014 the supreme head of the army. He acts as an inter mediary between the Government and the army. The recruiting, the technical organiza tion of the army, and all special questions are decided upon by the Commander-in-Chief. As by the provisions of the Bill of Rights the maintenance of an army in time of THE HORSE GUARDS. peace is illegal without Parliamentary sanction, each year, at the beginning of the Session, the Army Discipline and Regulation Act, with all the laws relative to the organization of the army, are renewed for a year. In default of this formality, the army would be virtually disbanded. The standing army numbers 132,905 men, a force for which Parliament voted in 1882-3 something over \u00a316,000,000 sterling. The British army in its normal condition is composed of 6 regiments of Household troops (the Guards), 3 of Cavalry, 3 of Infantry ; 31 regiments of Cavalry, 112 of Infantry, the Rifle Brigade, and the Royal regiment of Artillery of 30,000 men, divided into 17 brigades, of which 2 are mounted, 4 field, and the remainder garrison (siege) artiUery. These brigades are subdivided into batteries. There are besides a Corps of Royal Engineers, and the auxiliary services, commissariat transport, ambulance corps, and field telegraph corps, &c."], [108, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 96 To the active army must be added, (1) the Reserve (35,600 men), composed of old soldiers who are liable to be recalled to the army in war time, (2) the Militia (138,000 men), a kind of territorial army composed of men who serve 28 days with the colours every year, (3) the Yeomanry (14,000 men), whom we may consider as Militia cavalry, (4) the Volunteers (200,000 men). The last mentioned are a kind of National Guard, formed some 25 years ago when there was a rumour of French invasion. This body of men, at first independent, has, of late years, been placed under the War Office. By SOMERSET HOUSE (FROM THE EMBANKMENT). calling out these forces England in time of war, or in case of invasion, could put nearly 520,000 fighting men in the field. Somerset House, situated in the Strand and on the Thames Embankment near Waterloo Bridge, is occupied by the Audit Office, the Inland Revenue Offices, Stamp Office, &c. It is one of the really fine buildings in London. It was erected, on the site of the old palace of the Protector Somerset, in 1776, after the designs of Sir W. Chambers. The principal fajade looks upon the river and extends for some 250 yards. It is fronted by a fine terrace supported on arches, which are ornamented by allegorical masks, unfortunately half-concealed by the new Embankment, which detracts somewhat from the general effect of the building. The Strand front, which is not so extensive, is supported by three-quarter Corinthian columns, with an attic, divided into three compartments by allegorical statues representing Justice, Truth, Valor, and Moderation, surmounted by the Royal"], [109, "THE WEST-END. 97 Arms, and supported by Fame, and the Genius of England. At each extremity of the roof is a balustrade which completes the architectural effect. The principal entrance consists of three high arches, and access is through them given to the square Courtyard in which is a colossal bronze group by Bacon, the principal figure of which represents \" Father Thames,\" as the Euglish call the Genius of their river. The two side wings were added to the building by Smirke and Pennethorne, the left east) wing is occupied by- King's College. III. THE LAW COURTS. MAGISTRATES AND BARRISTERS. THE PRISONS. \u2014 THE CRIMINAL CLASSES. The Royal Palace of Justice is situated in the Strand, close to the entrance to the City, or, to be more exact, opposite the famous Griffin, which marks the site of Temple Bar. How such a practical people as the English have been able for so many centuries to put up with the strange arrangement of widely separated tribunals in various quarters of the town, from Westminster to the City, is a problem which no one will ever solve. However, everything, even the patience of litigants, has an end ; for the lawyers were not likely to complain of a system which, while it caused loss of time to their clients, brought to them munificent fees, so it was at last perceived that it would be more simple to centralize in one and the same building all the Courts of Justice. The Government purchased the ground, architects were invited to submit plans and designs, and the winner in the competition, Mr. Street, was entrusted with the erection of the Courts of -Justice. A fervent apostle of the Gothic style of architecture, this skilled designer of religious buildings was somewhat out of his element when he had to build a Palace of Justice \u2014 that is to say, a building, the uses of which being entirely practical, demanded well-ventilated and well-lighted rooms, corridors into which daylight could freely penetrate, commodious means of ingress and egress, and large, wide, straight staircases. The exterior of the Law Courts presents a facade composed of a central building of wings of unequal dimensions, the whole embellished with pointed gables, pinnacles, arcades, and vaulted porches, flanked by a tower 150 feet high. The interior, which recalls a convent or a monastery, is dark and badly lighted ; from the very first the judges, with an unanimity which is often wanted in their opinions, complained of the bad arrangement of their courts, and ever since it has been sought to remedy, as far as may be, the numerous inconveniences of the New Law Courts, of which the narrow corridors and tortuous staircases resemble the English law \u2014 a labyrinth of which the oldest judges and the most cunning lawyers do not know the \"ins and outs.\" As a matter of fact, England has no Code except as regards criminal procedure, and, as a law is not repealed unless an Act of Parliament formally declares it to be so, the resv.lt is a confusion more easy to imagine than depict, a condition of things which the English themselves describe as \"the glorious uncertainty of the law.\" Nevertheless, the 13"], [110, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 98 judicial organization has recently been reformed in many essential particidars. The old Courts of Chancery, the Queen's Bench, the Common Pleas, and the Exchequer, as well as those of the Admiralty and Divorce, have been united in one Supreme Court of Justice, composed of two sections, namely, the High Court of Justice and the High Court of Appeal. The former includes three divisions : Chancery, Queen's Bench, and Admiralty and Divorce. The functions of the last-named are self-evident ; the other two have diverse businesses, and can hear civil or criminal cases, according to circumstances. The Chancery division is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who is assisted by six judges. The Queen's Bench division has fourteen judges and a president, who is the Lord Chief Justice of England. The Admiralty and Divorce Division has a president and a judge. Each of these functionaries receives \u00a35,000 a year, the Lord Chancellor \u00a310,000 a year. The High Court of Appeal, of which the Lord Chancellor is, ex officio, president, is composed of five special judges and of the presidents of the three great divisions of the High Court of Justice, who are ex officio members of the Appeal Court. As a last resource, the House of Lords forms a court of ultimate appeal, and the knowledge of justice not being hereditary, like the peerage, the judicial functions of the Upper House are exclusively reserved for those members of it who occupy, or have occupied, high positions in the legal world, and to three special judges, upon whom the Queen has bestowed life peerages \u2014 that is to say, whose titles expire with them. The most important criminal tribunal is the Central Criminal Court, which sits at the Old Bailey, near Newgate, in the City. During the sessions two of the Judges of the High Court sit at this tribunal, of which the Lord Mayor is the President, in right of his office. As, with the exception of some towns \u2014 Liverpool and Manchester amongst others \u2014 the provinces have only inferior tribunals, whose powers are limited, England is divided into eight judicial districts, called \" Circuits,\" which are visited four times a year bj the Judges of the High Court, to investigate the civil and criminal cases which do not come within the powers of the local tribunals \u2014 the County Courts and the Courts of Quarter Sessions. Finally, there are the Police Courts, simply called in the provinces \" Courts of Petty Sessions,\" and in large towns \" Police Courts,\" which investigate unimportant cases; but it is nevertheless necessary that all criminal proceedings should be first carried on in these Courts, for the law lays down the rule that every individual arrested shall be, with the least possible delay, carried before a magistrate, who commits the accused for trial or sets him free at once, as the case may be. The Magistracy is not, as in France, a special career. AU the English judges, from the magistrate in the police court to the Lord Chancellor, are drawn from the Bar; and any barrister may be called to sit in the High Court of Justice. It is, therefore, interesting to be acquainted with the organization of the Bar. The right to confer the title of barrister is vested in four ancient bodies \u2014 the Inns of Court, which form a Corporation. To be admitted as a student, it is necessary to pass an examination (from which, however, members of the Universities are exempt) ; and, before they obtain tbe title of barrister, the students must submit to a definite test, and display sufficient knowledge of the law. After having practised for a certain time, the most"], [111, "THE NEW LAW COURTS."], [112, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 100 distinguished barristers obtain the honorary title of \" Queen's Counsel;\" and from these the magistrates are selected. The Lord Chancellor is, in the judicial hierarchy, the highest functionary in the kingdom. He is the custodian of the Great Seal, a member of the Cabinet and of tlu Privy Council, and President of the House of Lords. He is nominated, by the Prime Minister, from amongst the most eminent lawyers, and is changed with the Ministry. The judges of the Supreme Court are nominated as follows: the presidents of the various divisions by the Prime Minister, and the other judges by the Lord Chancellor, who also nominates those of the lower tribunals and the police-courts. These appoint ments are absolutely certain, and for life. When hearing cases the judges wear red robes and a wig. The barristers wear less voluminous wigs aud black silk robes when Queen's Counsel, simple serge when barristers. From the Law Courts to the Prisons the transition is easy j and although these establishments, useful as they are, do not afford any but a relative interest to the tourist, we must not pass on without saying a few words concerning Newgate, whicli is situated near the eastern end of Holborn Viaduct, at the corner of Newgate Street. The sombre and lugubrious edifice which we now see was built little more than one hundred years ago (1783), on the site of the former prison, which was burned in 1780, during the Gordon Riots. It would be difficult to imagine any building of a more NEWGATE. dismal aspect anJ more repugnant than Newgate, which is about to be demolished, to the infinite satisfaction of the inhabitants of the district. Executions were formerly conducted in front of the prison; but the scandalous scenes which occurred on these occasions decided the Government to alter the procedure, and since 1868 those sentenced to death are hanged within the precincts of the prison, in the presence only of the authorities and representatives of the Press. A black flag, hoisted on the building, announces to the idlers that justice has been done. Two other large prisons situated in London are Pentonville (the Model Prison) and Clerkenwell. There are, besides, other gaols and \" houses\u00bbof correction.\" Notwithstanding the spread of education, the amount of crime is very great ; and, although the number of criminals seems to be diminishing, the offences seem to increase in a marked degree. Statistics inform us that there are sixty-seven prisons in England and Wales, which contain 17,800 criminals. In 1881 there were brought before the various tribunals 690,000 persons, of whom 138,000 were acquitted. Of the 669,000 condemned to various terms of punishment by the Courts of first instance, police, etc.,, 174,481 were sentenced for drunkenness, 84,000 for assaults, and 50,000 for robberies."], [113, ":EW LAW COURTS (GREAT HALL)."], [114, "102 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. Criminal statistics give a grand total of 51,193 crimes committed, but the number of criminals arrested only reached 20,989. Of these 20,989 accused, 4,546 were released because of insufficient proof against them ; 1,090 because no one appeared to prosecute, and the remaining 15,000 were sentenced. Twenty-three capital sentences were recorded in that year, but only eleven of the condemned were executed ; the others had their sentences commuted to penal servitude. The civil cases heard before the Chancellor and Queen's Bench Divisions are very numerous. In 1881 the latter tribunal alone had 24,000 cases. The Divorce Court heard 470 demands for decrees nisi, and 119 demands for separation, of which 53 separations and 311 divorces were granted. As to the Bankruptcy Court, it had to deal with 4,835 bankrupts, whose collective liabilities amounted to \u00a317,000,000 sterling, and whose assets were scarcely \u00a35,000,000.

MARTIN'S IN THE FIELDS. ST. GEORGE'S. ST. JAMES'S, &C. Westminster Abbey is, after the Tower of London, the most interesting edifice, both from its antiquity and from its historical associations. From the Saxon King, Harold, to Queen Victoria, all the Sovereigns of England have been crowned there, and within it many of them sleep their last sleep. By the side of her Kings, England has found space for many of her illustrious children. Poets, artists, men of letters, statesmen, all the* phases of National glory are represented there. In a word, Westminster Abbey is Reims and St. Denis with the Pantheon besides. The Abbey of Westminster (the monastery of the west) , so named to distinguish it from St. Paul's, which was formerly known as East Minster, is situated on the site of a church, built by Edward the Confessor, of which no traces remain. Begun in the reign of Henry IIL, the Abbey was enlarged and embellished by his successors. Henry- VII. built the elegant chapel which bears his name, and in the last century Sir Christopher Wren removed the two unfinished towers, and replaced them by those now in existence, which are scarcely in harmony with the other portions of the building. The history of the Abbey is the epitome of the history of the English people for eight centuries : it need only be indicated here in outline. In 1066, Edward the Confessor was buried in the church he had built ; and at the end of the same year \u2014 on Christmas day \u2014 William the Conqueror was consecrated King of England, by the Bishop of Coutances, in the presence of the Norman and English nobles, amid the acclamations of the spectators. Their cheers were mistaken by the Normans for cries of distress, and a bloody massacre ensued.

But under the rei\u00b0-n of \" Bloody Mary,\" the Abbey was restored to Roman Catholicism.

In 1821, the coronation of George IV. was celebrated with great pomp and most imposing ceremonials ; but a sad incident cast a gloom over the brilliant WESTMINSTER ABBEY (LATERAL FACADE). ceremony. Queen Caroline, who came to be crowned as Queen Consort, was brutally repulsed by the King's orders; broken-hearted she retired to Branden burg House, where she expired a few days afterwards. It is a curious fact that the crown with which George IV. was crowned did not belong to him, it had been borrowed from a jeweller, Rundell, who demanded =\u00a316,000 for the loan of this indispensable ornament. William IV, who succeeded him, was more economical, aud only spent \u00a337,000 on his coronation, which was a very tidy sum. More simple still, but not less imposing, was the coronation of Queen Victoria"], [117, "THE WEST-END. 105 (28th June, 1838), whose grace, beauty, and youthfulness, gave a special attraction to the ceremony. The young Queen, in royal robes, received the crown from the Arch- NAVE OF WESTMINSTER ABBEV. bishop of Canterbury, who placed it on her head. At the same moment, the Peers of the Realm put on their coronets, the Bishops their mitres ; the drums and trumpets resounded through the aisles, while the salvoes of artillery, and the enthusiastic shouts of the multitude, shook the building to its foundations. u"], [118, "106 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. For a long time, Westminster possessed the rights of sanctuary. The wife of Edward IV. took refuge there, when Warwick, the kingmaker, had put Edward in prison ; and there abandoned by everyone, she gave birth to Edward V. Later on, when Gloucester wished to possess himself of the crown, she had a second time to \" gain of Westminster the inviolable sanc tuarv.\" The precincts of Westminster have lately been made a parish, of which the official designation is St. Peter's, Westminster. The church is in the form of a Latin cross, and consists of a fine nave, transept, and an apsis sur rounded by little chapels. Henry VII.'s Chapel is a pro longation of the apsis, and gives to tbe two portions of the Abbey, divided by the transept, an equal length. The two sides ofthe Cross are not the same width \u2014 an arrange ment which detracts somewhat from the interior aspect of the fabric : the northern arm contains a beauti ful rose window 30 feet in diameter. \"Poets' Corner\" is at the southern branch or arm. The interior dimensions are as follows : \u2014 the length from one PULPIT (WESTMINSTER ABBEY). extremity to the other is about 510 feet, and the height about 102 feet. The visitor is struck by the height of the nave, which is supported by high clustered columns, above which is the triforium and a range of windows, some of stained glass. The wood-carvings ofthe choir are modern, as well as the altar and the organ. All parts of the edifice are embellished with statues, and a large number of monumental tablets, of which some are worthy of notice, and the greater part mediocre, so that the fane has rather the appearance of a museum than a church. Thus a very peculiar and very strange effect is produced. The chapels are interesting. The most remarkable is that of Henry VIL, a master piece of Gothic architecture, the entrance to which is barred by a brass railing of curious workmanship. The nave presents a double range of twisted columns, the bases of which are \"hidden behind the stalls of the Knights of the Bath, who formerly held their meetings here, and whose banners are suspended from the walls. The roof, embellished with pendentives and ornamented with carvings, is of a richness of ornamentation rarely seen. It is a delicious intermingling of stone lace-work, an abundance of ingenious motives, a fecundity of invention, which one can never be weary of admiring. The whole is"], [119, "THE AVEST-END. 107 wonderfully conceived, and carried out with a carefulness of execution, of which it is impossible to give an idea. It is the gold smith's art in stoue-work. Thirty - three windows light the chapel whicli contains the tomb of Henry VIL, by Torrigiano, and that of Mary, Queen of Scots. Here we may also notice a statue of the Duke of Mont pensier, the brother of Louis Philippe, by Westmacott; the tomb of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, and the sumptuous monument erected by James I., to the memory of Elizabeth. The Chapel of St. Edmund contains some monuments very interesting by reason of their antiquity. One of the most curious is that of William de Valence ; it is embel lished with enamels on brass, and in former days was surrounded by thirty statuettes. The Chapel of St. Nicholas shelters the tombs of the Duchess of Somerset, wife of the Protector; of Lady Burghley, and of Kathcrine de Valois, wife of Henry V. St. Edward the Confessor's Chapel, or the Chapel of the Kings, is situated CORONATION CHAIR (WESTMINSTER ABBEY). immediately behind the altar, from which it is separated by a screen, decorated with 14 bas-reliefs, representing incidents in the life of Edward. The tomb of this Prince is in the centre of the chapel; it was formerly covered with mosaics and slabs of marble. Around this tomb are those of Henry IIL, Edward I. and his wife Eleanor, of Queen Philippa, of Richard II. and his wife, of Henry V. and other sovereigns. It is from this assemblage of the royal dead that the chapel takes its second title. Here also POETS' CORNER (WESTMINSTER ABBEY). is the Coronation chair, in which is embedded the black stone which, according to tradition, served Jacob for a pillow.

Here we find two remarkable monuments, works of the sculptor Roubiliac : the first is that in memory of Sir Francis Vere; the second that of Lady Nightingale. It is related that a friend of Roubiliac found him one day deep iu thought before one of the four statues of the knights which adorn the tomb of De Vere. At the moment when the friend was about to address the artist, the latter seized him by the arm, and pointing to the statue, exclaimed, \" Hush, he is about to speak!\" . . \u2022 Nothing can be more graceful than the figure of Lady Nightingale, or more expressive than a her features, in which can be read the fear of Death, who is threaten- ing her with his dart, But it is chiefly for the monu ments, statues, and tablets, which it contains, that the Abbey of West- minster is so interesting to the tourist, the artist, and the sisht-seer *, there are few impressions so moving as those which we experience when we visit this Pan theon of England. If St. Paul's is almost exclusively devoted to the records of military glory, Westminster is par excel lence the resting-place of men Ulustrious in science. art, letters, and politics, which have done more than warriors to build up POETS' CORNER (WESTMINSTER ABBEY). the greatness of Great Britain. All are here united in death, oblivious, no doubt, in the peaceful regions which they have reached, of the divisions which separated them in this life, and remembering only their common devotion to their country, which they loved and served so well. Poets, actors, statesmen, men of science, authors, historians, repose side by side without order, in a medley which sometimes causes singular meetings. Thus, in the northern aisle, Pitt and Fox, the two rivals, are buried close to each other, not far from the actor Kemble and Mrs. Siddons, his sister, the tragedienne. A tablet bears the"], [121, "THE WEST-END. 109 name of Davy, the illustrious chemist, and close at hand is the monument to Sir John Franklin, who met his death in search of the North-west Passage.

Returning towards the nave we pass the tablets commemorative of Purcell and Blow, thecelebrated musicians who lived in the end of the 17th century. In the nave, Hers chel, the astronomer ; Ben Jonson, the com petitor of Shakespeare ; Killigrew, the wit; and Lord Holland, the English Mec\u00e6nas, face Wordsworth and Con greve, the poets; Lord Clyde and Sir Henry Havelock, the heroes of the Indian Mutiny ; and Newton, the immortal genius.

Oil the left, three tablets bear the names of Samuel Johnson, the famous lexicographer, celebrated for his roughness and whimsicalities; of Sheridan, the author of the immortal \" School for Scandal ; \" and of Garrick. The tablet commemorative of Oliver Goldsmith, who has left us one of the most exquisite works in the English language, \"The Vicar of Wakefield,\" bears a Latin inscription by Samuel Johnson, who peremptorily refused to dishonour the walls of Westminster by an inscription in English. Then, in the angle, we have Gay, the author of the \" Fables ; \" Thomson, the poet of the \" Seasons ; \" Campbell, who sang the \" Pleasures of Hope ; \" and Southey. Near by rises the monument erected by George II. to WiUiam Shakespeare, whose remains rest at Stratford-on-Avon, his birthplace.

Near Handel's monument, a bust and a tomb attract the attention of all visitors, the least literary as well as the most refined. The bust represents the features of Thackeray, the author of \" Vanity Fair ; \" the tomb is that of Charles Dickens, the creator of the immortal \" Pickwick,\" the stirring writer, all whose works are equally master-pieces, and whose name, celebrated everywhere, is surrounded by an imperishable glory. This rapid glance at some of the principal monuments of Westminster Abbey, which would require a volume to describe in detail, suffices to justify the name of the Pantheon of England, which we have bestowed upon the old Abbey, and that is one of the most worthy titles, if not the most worthy, which could be bestowed upon it. The Chapter House, one of the curiosities of the Abbey, communicates by a passage with the nave of the cathedral. It is an octagon building, the roof of which is supported by a central marble column, to wliich the monks condemned to the scourge were fastened. Here we perceive an ancient mural painting of the fourteenth century in a good state of preservation, and many old relics, armour, seals, old charts, etc., preserved in cases. The Chapter House was restored in 1866. by Sir G. Scott. Divine service is celebrated at the Abbey every morning. On Sundays the attendance is very numerous, for the music and the choir of Westminster are celebrated. Many people are drawn thither by the excellent sermons which are preached. Westminster, formerly an episcopate, is now only a deanery ; but the Dean of Westminster, nominated by the Crown, enjoys complete independence, and is only responsible to the Sovereign. Close to the Abbey is the church of St. Margaret, which is periodically threatened with destruction, because it spoils the view, and does not harmonize with its sur roundings. It contains the tomb of Caxton, the introducer of the art of printing into England, and that of Sh- Walter Raleigh. The other religious edifices scattered broadcast throughout the metropolis are less interesting. We must, however, make an exception in favour of the church of St. Saviour, Southwark, on the right bank of the Thames, of which the choir, the Lady Chapel, and a transept dating from the 14th century, are considered exceUent specimens of English architecture of the Middle Ages. The other parts of the edifice, added at various periods, are the despair of arch\u00e6ologists \u2014 a race who are very difficult to please, as we all know. St. Saviour's contains some curious tombs. We find that of the poet Gower, who lived in the 15th century; that of Andrews, Bishop of Winchester, who died in 1626; and a wooden figure representing a knight. In the churchyard were buried Edmund Shakespeare, brother of the poet ; Fletcher and Massinger, the dramatic authors ; and Henslowe, the actor; but their tombs have not been discovered. The church of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, dates from the 18th century, and possesses a handsome portico. The edifice occupies the site of an ancient church, in wliich the famous Chancellor Bacon was christened. In the vaults are the"], [125, "THE WEST-END. 113 SAVIOUR'S CHURCH (SOUTHWARK). ST.

Is it because there were celebrated the nuptials of Emma Harte, or Lyons, the too notorious Lady Hamilton ? St. James's, Piccadilly, is a heavy brick building, guarded by a walled court ; it was erected after the designs of Wren.

THE ROYAL ACADEMY. \u2014 THE ROYAL SOCIETY. \u2014 THE ROYAL INSTITUTION, ETC. The British Museum is situated in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, on the site of Montague House. It is separated from the street by a gilded iron railing, the gates giving access to the well-kept courtyard with grass-plots. The principal front shows us a central building aud two projecting wings; it is surrounded by a stylobate five feet high, which supports forty-four columns, 45 feet in height. The great portico, to whicli we ascend by a wide flight of steps, is composed of a double colonnade, on which rests a pediment, the tympanum of whicli is decorated with allegorical sculptures by Sir R. Westmacott, representing the progress of Civilization. The general plan is a rectangle formed of four blocks of buildings surrounding a vast interior court, in which was budt (in 1857) the great Reading Room. This Museum, one of the richest iu Europe, has existed for little more than a century. In fact, it was not opened until January, 1759, by virtue of an Act of Parliament of 1753, authorizing the purchase of the collection of Sir Hans Sloane, and the Library of Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, and confiding the administration of the Museum to fifty Trustees, including the Lord Chancellor, the Primate, and the Speaker of the House of Commons. This was the origin of the British Museum, the rapid increase of wliich is well-nigh prodigious. Acquisitions and donations increased and multiplied to such an extent, that new galleries had to be erected, and all the Natural History collections had to be transferred to a specially-constructed Museum at South Kensington. In the near future, it will be necessary to erect other special museums, for the collections now in Great Russell Street are pinched for room, and the British Museum will, unfortunately, lose the distinctive mark which is conferred on it by the grouping in one building of artistic, ethnographical, zoological, mineral, and botanical curiosities; as well as the magnificent national library, which numbers 1,300,000 printed volumes. The Library is being extended greatly \u2014 thanks to the sum of \u00a310,000 whicli is annually set aside for approved acquisitions, estimated at 20,000 volumes. It is much to be desired that other National Libraries would take example by the Reading Room of the British Museum, the arrangements of which are absolutely perfect. Let the reader picture to himself an immense domed, circular hall, 140 feet in diameter, lighted by twenty high windows by day, and by electric lamps, suspended from the ceding, at dusk; brightly painted and gilded. In the centre a species of round desk (\" tribune\"), occupied by the superintendent and his assistants, is surrounded by concentric shelves, which contain the 300 folio volumes of the manuscript catalogue \u2014 the printed catalogue is not yet finished \u2014 and these form a"], [128, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 116 kind of nave ofa gigantic wheel, of wliich the thirty-five rows of desks for the readers are the spokes. These desks (aud tables), of whicli two rows are reserved for ladies exclusively, are furnished with folding bookstands, ink bottles, blotting pads, &c., for the workers. No trouble has been spared to make the reading-room as commodious as possible. The system of ventilation is perfect, and means are provided by which hot or cold air can be introduced, according to the seasons. For some years the introduction of the electric light has enabled the authorities to prolong the hours during wliich the readers, who are always increasing in numbers, may work ; for there is scarcely a savant, a novelist, or a journalist, who does not use the Museum Library. Sir Walter Scott, Macaulay, Charles Lamb, Washington Irving, Hallam, Grote, Bulwer Lytton, Thackeray, Douglas Jerrold, have all passed many hours there ; so have M. Guizot, M. Thiers, Louis Philippe, and more recently still, Cavour, Garibaldi, Louis Blanc, and many others whom the changes and chances of political life hive forced to take advantage of the hospitality which England accords to all with impartial generosity. Admission to the British Museum is absolutely gratuitous. The Grenville and the Kiug's Libraries are open to the public, but no one can enter the reading-room without a ticket of admission. The sculpture galleries, which are perhaps the richest in the world in Grecian and Roman antiquities, include the famous Parthenon frieze, fragments of the Erectheum and of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, as well as an immense number of admirable antique marbles. Amongst the Egyptian antiquities will be found the celebrated Rosetta Stone, and a beautiful collection of papyrus of the greatest value. The bronzes of Roman, Greek, and Etruscan art came partly from the collections of Payne Knight, Hamilton, Pourtales, De Blacas, and Castellani. It is in the British Museum, in the Jewel Gallery, that the priceless Portland Vase will be found. It was one day broken into fragments by some idiot who struck it with his cane. The Coin and Medal Department, rich in Greek and Roman antiquities, offers to the spectator a superb collection of Eastern moneys ; and the gallery of engravings and drawings includes splendid specimens of aU schools, and particularly of the English, Dutch, and French masters. The \"Budget\" of the British Museum is considerable \u2014 about \u00a310J,000, of which \u00a324,000 are appropriated to acquisitions of all kinds, and the remainder to the payment of the officials, the repairs, and general expenses. The National Gallery occupies the north side of Trafalgar Square, and the building in which the pictures are located, consists of a portico flanked by two wings, with a villainous leaden cap, which is dignified by the name of a dome, of no architectural worth. Founded in 1824, this GaUery of Paintings consists of more than 1,000 choice [lictures, and is enriched every year by a number of valuable works. It is estimated that 1 400,000 have been spent in adding to the collection since the National GaUery was opened ; but this sum is very far short of the value of the collection, of which the most precious specimens have been given to the nation by private individuals or artists. The richest donations thus made were bequeathed by Lord Farnborough, Mr. Vernon, and Mr. Wymi Ellis. Iu the entrance hall is a statue of David Wilkie, whose palette is encased on the"], [129, "ERITISH MUSEUM."], [130, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 118 pedestal, and a bas-relief by Banks, representing Thetis aud her nymphs consoling- Achilles. The galleries are lighted from above, and each picture bears a tablet, giving thc name of the painter and the subject of it\u2014 au excellent idea\u2014 very simple aud very useful, which ought to be adopted in all galleries. Of the eighteen rooms in the National Gallery, eight are devoted to the English school of painting, four to the Italian, one to the French, aud one to the Dutch. The others are occupied by special collections, one of them named the Select Cabinet, contains the gems of the collection\u2014 the pearls of the museum. In this apartment we find the '-Holy Family,\" and the \" Catherine of Alexandria,\" by Raphael; the \"Entombment\" and the \"Madonna,\" by Michael Angelo; the celebrated \" Vierge au panier,\" by Correg gio; \"Bacchus and Ariadne;\"and\"Christ\" and the portrait of \"Ariosto,\" by Titian, as well as many other magnificent canvases signed by the most illustrious artists of the Italian school. The French school is represented by Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin, Philippe de Cham pagne, Rigaud, and Joseph Vernet ; the Spanish masters by UUK.T OF SOUTH KENSINGTON MUSEUM. Murillo, Velasquez, aud Zurbaran; the Dutch by Rembrandt, Rubens, Van Eyck Ruysdael, Teniers, Van Dyck. Amongst the pictures of the English school, we notice the \" Marriage a la mode \" by Hogarth; the \"Cornfield,\" by Constable ;\" the landscapes of dome and Cooper; portraits by Gainsborough, Lawrence, Romney, and Reynolds; the sea-pieces of Stanfield ; the animals of Landseer ; aud, above all, the twenty-five pictures by Turner, of which \" Dido building Carthage,\" and \" Sunrise in Fog,\" are, by the expressed wish of the artist, placed in the rooms devoted to the French school, beside the two paintings of Claude \u2014 the \" Marriage of Rebecca \" and the \" Queen of Sheba.\" According to English custom, many of these paintings are under glass, a very necessary precaution in such an atmosphere as that of London. The South Kensington Museum, surrounded by buildings which have nothing remarkable about tlieir appearance, inasmuch as they are incomplete, has, so to speak, no fagade. The two doors which give entrance to the galleries are narrow and inconvenient, and, like all that is provisional, threaten to endure for ever. To the initiative of the late Prince Consort, seconded by Sir Henry Cole, we are"], [131, "THE WEST-END. 119 indebted for this Museum of industrial art, which has served as a model for all institutions of a similar character recently established in all European countries, under the influence of the great artistic movement, the tendency of which is to raise the level of art as applied to industry, so long and so unjustly neglected. The Museum contains collections of objects of decorative art, paintings, sculpture, goldsmiths' work, jewellery, enamels, ivory, pottery, glass, metal, tapestry, &c. ; a gallery of English paintings, a museum of constructive materials, a museum of educa tion, an art library, and a museum of patents, in which models of all important inventions are exhibited. The Indian Museum, or rather the Indian Section, occupies a building on the other side ofthe street. Therein the collection brought from India by the Prince of Wales has been united NATIONAL GALLERY with those which were formerly in the Museum. The latter, once the property of the East India Company, were carried to the India Office, and finally deposited at South Kensington, where they will probably remain. There are a number of articles in gold and silver, arms and jewels, to be admired ; shawls and stuffs of vivid colours, ivory articles, and wood carved with a patience and skill only possessed by the Orientals; as well as the throne of Eunjeet Singh, idols covered with jewels, and admirably-executed models of the principal Indian monuments. It is a veritable dream \u2014 a chapter in \" The Thousand and One Nights \" \u2014 a vision of the Orient. The system of classification is difficult to define; we cannot say what idea presided over the arrangement of the collections. With the exception of the Italian art objects \u2014 which are placed in a gallery by themselves \u2014 the specimens seem to be distributed at random, and it is not easy to find them out. The jewels and terra cotta, the apparel and the forged iron, the pottery and the musical instruments, are placed pell-mell in the same gallery, without any regard to their production, or the countries whence they"], [132, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 120 have come. Notwithstanding \u2014 perhaps in consequence of\u2014 this confusion, the South Kensington Museum is one of the most interesting places in London ; everyone who goes there finds something to interest him \u2014 the artist and the \"working man,\" the arch\u00e6ologist, and the mere gazer, the studious and the idle. In certain sections a more severe taste might have been exercised in the choice of objects exhibited ; but the ensemble is as varied and as rich as possible, and many of the exhibits are of great rarity and value. On the first floor are the Raphael cartoons, seven in number, lately at Hampton Court, the Sheepshanks' gallery of pictures, the Jones' collection, and the British Water- Colour collection. The Bethnal Green Museum, situated in the east of London, in a populous quarter, is affiliated to South Kensington. It contains an economic exhibition, in wliich are shown all animal or vegetable products which are used for food, or capable of industrial application; as well as all modern objects of industrial art which have not been placed in the parent Museum. At Bethnal Green, as at Kensington, the exhibits are furnished with tickets clearly explaining all details connected with them, even to giving their prices. The South Kensington Museum is illuminated with the electric light; it is open until 10p.m. three times a week \u2014 Mondays, Tuesdays, and Saturdays. London possesses a great number of museums of a special nature, of which the principal are the Museum of Natural History, transferred from the British Museum to Kensington, and the National Portrait Gallery, at Kensington; the Museum of the College of Surgeons, and the Soane Museum, in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields ; the last named contains, amongst other valuable exhibits, twelve pictures by Hogarth, namely, eight of \" The Rake's Progress,\" and four of \" The Election.\" The Museum of Practical Geology is attached to the Royal School of Mines in Piccadilly (Jermyn Street) . The learned societies of London are very numerous, and some of them have acquired a just renown, owing to the works of their members. Thus the Royal Academy of Arts, the Royal Society, and the Royal Institution, not to mention others, have arrived at a position equivalent to the various sections of the French Institute. As is always the case, private enterprise has been the origin of their existence, and almost all of them have uprisen from very small beginnings. Many of these societies are sheltered under one roof in Burlington House, Piccadilly. The facade, in the Italian style, consists of two wings and a central \" pavilion,\" somewhat higher, and is enclosed by a handsome iron railing. Through the arch entrance is gained to the court-yard. At the end of the court is the former residence of the Earl of Burlington, which has been raised a storey, to make it harmonize with its new surroundings, and is occupied by the Royal Academy of Arts. Founded in 1768, this society is composed of forty-two Academicians, twenty Associates, and six Associate engravers. At the head is a president, who is nominated for life, assisted by a council of ten, elected by the Academicians, whose appointments, like that of the president, must he approved by the Sovereign. By the terms of its charter of consti tution, the Academy has the direction of a school of design, and must, every year, give, in May, an exhibition, open to all artists of merit. This exhibition is the London Salon. Since 1S69 thc committee of the Royal Academy have organized, in January,"], [133, "THE WEST-END. 121 an exhibition of \" old masters,\" the success of which is great. These canvases are lent by private individuals, and, to judge by the number of the works exhibited, the private collections of England must be of inestimable value. There is a custom of the Academy, which ordains that every member, on his election, shall offer to the society one of his works, be it painting or sculpture. All these, known as \" diploma works,\" are collected in a gallery open to the public, and form a most interesting collection. Amongst the most remarkable of the pictures is a portrait of George the Third by Reynolds, that of Gainsborough painted by himself, a peasant girl by Lawrence ; and, amongst the sculpture, Cupid and Psyche, the bust of Flaxman, by Nollekens, and that of West, by Chantrey. The palettes of Hogarth and Reynolds are preserved in the same gallery. The President of the Royal Academy is Sir Frederick Leighton, who succeeded Sir Francis Grant, a most distinguished portrait painter who had a specialite for aristocratic portraits. The first, and the most illus trious, President of the Royal Academy was Sir Joshua Reynolds, one of its founders. Amongst his colleagues we find the names of Gainsborough, AVest, Zuccarelli, Zoffani, Chambers, Bartolozzi, Cipriani, and Angelica Kauffmann. The Royal Academy has reckoned amongst its numbers, Turner, Mul ready, Wilkie, Landseer, Flaxman, Chantrey, Constable, Lawrence, Etty, Westmacott, Stanfield, &c. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM. All the world is now acquainted with the names of Millais, Alma Tadema, Frith, Sir John Gilbert, Long, Hook, Richmond, and Poynter, whose works are as well known to foreigners as to Englishmen. Six other Societies are located in Burlington House : the Royal Society, thc Society of Antiquaries, the Astronomical Society, the Chemical Society, the Geological Society, and the Linnean Society. The most important of all is the Royal Society \u2014 one of the oldest, moreover, and dates from 1663. It is the Academy of Sciences of England. Originally, it was established in the City : afterwards, it migrated to Somerset House, and thence to Burlington House. Amongst its most Ulustrious members we find Bayle, Newton, Faraday, Cook, Herschel, Davy, Franklin (who made the experiments with the lightning conductor), 11;"], [134, "122 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. Cavendish, Sloane, Woodward, and Arbuthnot. On the list of honorary members are the names of D'Alembert, Bernouilli, Linne, Euler, Buffon, Jussieu, and Voltaire. The Royal Society has often been the subject of ridicule more or less lively on the part of writers whom one would have credited with more wisdom. Butler, in his poem of the \" Elephant in the Moon,\" and Swift, in his description of Laputa, have ridiculed the English Scientists in a way which fully justifies the words of Montesquieu : \u2014 \" They run after wit and catch folly.\" Nothing could have been more unjust than these attacks, for the Royal Society, by its works on vaccination and electricity, its investigations of the courses of the stars, and its experiments concerning light, has rendered the greatest services to humanity. The Royal Society possesses a library rich in works of an exclusively scientific character, and some remarkable portraits of its iUustrious members. The reports of the society, dating from 1665, have been printed, and form a series of 160 quarto volumes. There is still preserved the sun-dial which the youthful Newton constructed upon the wall of his father's house, a telescope which he made for himself, and his mask in plaster, moulded by Roubiliac. The Society of Antiquaries, founded in 1572, dissolved by James I., no one knows why, could not obtain its charter until 1751. It has, nevertheless, rendered great services which have been somewhat tardily acknowledged, but which are none the less brilliant. To this society is due the restoration of the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey, which would have tumbled to pieces but for the exertions of the President, Earl Stanhope. The Astronomical Society only dates from 1820, and in its short career has proved its utility by its works, enshrined in thirty-eight volumes, which form its reports. The Linneau Society was, at first, a section of the Royal Society, from which it seceded in 1802. It is now very prosperous, and its important labours have placed it in the foremost rank of those societies which are more especially devoted to Botany and Zoology. The library and its contents are celebrated. In 1829, the society purchased for \u00a325,000 the collection that Linne had formed; and in 1832, the East India Company made the Linneans a present of a complete collection of Indian flora. Lastly, the Chemical Society, sounded in 1841, for the encouragement of the study of chemistry, and the Geological Society, founded in 1807, though not of the importance of the societies we have mentioned above, occupy a very honourable position in the scientific world. Of relatively recent foundation, but very celebrated for the services it has rendered, aud every day renders, is the Royal Institution, established in 1799 chiefly by the efforts of Count Rumsord. The Royal Institution occupies spacious premises in Albemarle Street, a budding designed by Arulliamy, presenting an imposing colonnade of the Corinthian order, resting on a stylobate, and rising to the whole height of the three storeyed edifice. EstabUshed with a view to promote the application of science to industry, the Royal Institution, whose motto is \" Illustrans commoda vit\u00e6,\" gives a series of lectures, which are attended not only by persons connected with industry and trade, but also and chiefly by a select public. The success of these lectures will be easily understood when we mention the names of the lecturers, Owen, Huxley, and Tyndall."], [135, "THE WEST END. 123 It was in the laboratory of this Society that Davy discovered what he called the \"metallic bases of earths,\" and where Faraday made his remarkable discoveries in electrical science. The Royal Institution possesses a splendid library, a theatre in which the lectures are delivered, a laboratory, and a museum of mineralogy. At the corner of Trafalgar Square, in Pall Mall (East), we notice an elegant building, with a portico sustained by six Doric columns. This is the Royal College of BURLINGTON HOUSE. Physicians, founded in 1523, under Henry VIII., one of the nineteen educational or university bodies which possessed the right to bestow medical diplomas in England. The library of the College is most remarkable. In the Council Hall (\"Censors' Room\") are many busts and portraits of celebrated doctors: \u2014 Mayerne, King, Sydenham, Radcliffe, Sir Hans Sloane, Mead, Harvey \u2014 who discovered the circulation of the blood \u2014 Hunter, and others. Here also are preserved the anatomical preparations with which Harvey used to illustrate his course of lectures. To visit the College of Physicians it is necessary to be introduced by a member ofthe Society, to which belong most of the doctors in London."], [136, "124 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. The Royal Horticultural Society is justly celebrated for the splendid gardens which it possesses at Chiswick. Those at Kensington have been, since 1883, occupied by temporary constructions where annual exhibitions are held, the success of which is so great that they threaten to continue to infinity. The first was the \"Fisheries\" Exhibition, followed in 1884 by a \" Health \" Exhibition, to which, in 1885, succeeded an \"Inventions\" Exhibition. In 1886 there was an \"Indian and Colonial\" Exhibition. Two other Societies are located in the Regent's Park ; these are the Zoological and Botanical Societies. The latter, whose name clearly indicates its aims, has been UNIVERSITY COLLEGE. established since 1839, and its gardens occupy the space on which the Prince Regent designed to erect a palace \u2014 a project which was never realized. The gardens, admirably laid out, are surrounded by a palisade and thick hedges, which entirely defy the eyes of the curious ; this is an arrangement which meets with much favour in England, where every one likes privacy. The Conservatory, or Winter Garden, is large enough to contain 2,000 people. It is of iron and glass, very light, and ingeniously warmed and ventilated ; it contains a collection of rare and remarkable plants. Open to the public by tickets issued by Fellows during the week, the gardens on Sundavs are only frequented by the members of the Society and their friends. During the season the fetes are attended by the elite of English society. Not far off are the Gardens of the Zoological Society, which is constituted in the same manner as the two last-mentioned. There is the same intolerance and the same exclusiveness; the public is never admitted without payment, and as for the Sundays, the members and their friends only are admitted to see the lions devour their sanguinary"], [137, "THE WEST-END. 125 repast of gory flesh, and the serpents torture and swallow, after crushing the bones of, inoffensive rabbits and guinea-pigs \u2014 of which the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals takes no account whatever. VI. PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. THE BOARD SCHOOLS. \u2014 THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THE LONDON UNIVERSITY. It is only within the last few years that the English Government has devoted its attention to public instruction, and even now there is no Minister charged with this duty. There is a section of the Privy Council, called the Committee of Council on Education, which undertakes the inspection of the primary schools only ; for the Act of 1870, the first and only one dealing with the subject, accepts the burthen of elementary instruction only. All that concerns higher grades is left to private enterprise \u2014 that is to say, to schools and colleges, and to the Universities. Since 1870 there have been established, in every parisii or borough, forming what is termed a \"school district,\" one or several schools large enough to accommodate all the children. These are the Board Schools. Education is compulsory for all children over five years of age up to thirteen, and the parents who are guilty of any infraction of the law are liable to a fine. Gratuitous instruction is not given unless there is actual inability to pay; their education is then chargeable to the rates by a special impost. These schools are placed under a committee named the School Board, elected by the ratepayers (tri-annually), and inspected by the officials appointed by the Committee of Council on Education. In 1881 there were 21,136 schools, attended by 3,850,000 scholars, and it has been calculated that the education of each pupil in the Board School costs about two pounds sterling annually. For fifteen years now the new system has been working, and has given excellent results : the number of pupils, which has doubled since 1871, is increasing from year to year, in an ever advancing progression. The \" secondary instruction \" and higher education are quite free, and the State does not trouble itself in the matter. This question, like many others, has been left to private initiative, which performs wonders, it is true ; but the drawback is the high terms required at public schools, where instruction is very dear. In the beginning these schools, founded by rich private individuals or by Corporations, were absolutely gratuitous; but by degrees they have been warped from their original direction. In almost all schools the pupils, with the exception of the foundation scholars, pay ; and instruction is dearer than in France. The system of lodging lads all in one building (casernement) is unknown in England; they are accommodated at the houses of masters authorized to receive them. Generally there are ten or twelve in each house. There they take their meals together,"], [138, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 126 and prepare their tasks. The classes are taken in the school-house itself. Out of school hours the boys enjoy very great liberty, going and coming as they please, without being under the eyes of an usher \u2014 a pion, as the French caU him. The advantages of this system are that the young Britons, when at school, are apprenticed to life; and at an age when the French youth would scarcely dare to venture into the streets by himself, the English boys know how to behave themselves, and assume, so to speak, responsibility for their acts. The inconvenience is that when the youths have left Eton or Harrow, where they have learned little or nothing, they proceed to the Universities, where, to pass certain stipulated examinations \u2014 no matter what career they intend to adopt, except commerce\u2014 they are constrained to follow, for six months, or a year, or more, the course of those professors whose speciality it is to prepare pupils for the examinations, and who are called \" crammers \" \u2014 a very expressive name indeed ! This is a contingency for which every one is prepared. The \" cram mer \" is now \u2014 particularly since the institution of examinations for Govern ment posts, and for admission to the military and naval colleges \u2014 regarded as the necessary complement of a college education. The respective advantages of the French and the English systems have often been discussed, and no one has come nearer the solution of the ques tion. The truth is that each nation LONDON UNIVERSITY. has adopted the course whicli is best suited to its needs, and the spirit ofthe race; and to import the English method into France, or the French system into England, might produce deplorable results. As a matter of course, the greater part of the schools and colleges are in the provinces. The most celebrated public schools are those at Eton, near Windsor; Harrow, in the county of Middlesex, near London ; Rugby, in Warwickshire ; and Winchester, in Hampshire. London includes some schools which it is in contemplation to move to the outskirts of the metropolis \u2014 an excellent plan in the interests of the scholars. It is difficult to imagine a locality less suitable for a school than the centre of the city, where St. Paul's School so long flourished (it is now situated in Kensington), and where Christ's Hospital and the Merchant Tailors' Schools stiU exist\u2014 for the present. The last-mentioned derives its name from the Corporation which instituted it. The University of London is not, like the University of Oxford and Cambridge, a scholastic institution. It is a simple committee of examiners, nominated and salaried by the Government, and established only since 1837. It consists of a chancellor, a"], [139, "THE WEST-END. 127 senate \u2014 that is to say, of the Examinations Committee\u2014 and an administrative body. There are two sessions each year, at the termination of which the candidates who have satisfied the examiners obtain degrees and honours. The Examination Hall of the University, behind Burlington House, has a frontage in Burlington Gardens \u2014 an elegant fa9ade, embellished by statues and flanked by two square turrets. VII. THE PARKS. THE SQUARES. THE EMBANKMENTS. THE BRIDGES. Nothing strikes the stranger more than the extensive parks situated iu various districts, even in the centre of London, by which the air is purified and renewed. It is to tbe number of its open spaces, parks, squares, and promenades, that London partly owes its salubrity; the English are aware of this, so they do not grudge the funds necessary for the maintenance of these gardens, which are admirably kept, and on which the significant name of \"the Lungs of London\" has been bestowed. See with what jealous care the people protect the unoccupied spaces, planted with trees, against the encroachments of the speculative builder, who would, with pleasure, convert Hyde Park into streets of houses, if the vigilance of the citizens and the authorities did not prevent him. There are in London itself nine large parks, of which the most beautiful \u2014 Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, the Green Park, St. James's Park, and Regent's Park \u2014 are situated in the aristocratic quarters of the metropolis, in the AVest End ; the others are scattered in the various populous districts lying to the east, north, and south. Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, although separated by a railing and ditch, are virtually one park, and have a superficial area of about 640 acres. The entrance gates are ten in number, of which the chief are Hyde Park Corner (Piccadilly), and the Marble Arch (Oxford Street). The former is an elegant colonnade, embellished with bas-reliefs, copied from the Parthenon, and affords three carriage ways, with two entrances for pedestrians ; the latter, as its name indicates, consists of a triumphal arch of white marble, which was formerly the entrance to Buckingham Palace, but wliich was removed to Hyde Park in 1851, when the new portion of the Palace was built. Entering the Park at the \" Corner,\" we find ourselves approaching a colossal statue in bronze, \" erected by the ladies of England, to Arthur, Duke of AVellington, and his brave companions in arms.\" This statue, on which is bestowed the name of Achilles, is a copy of one of those two at Monte Cavallo, in Rome, known as Castor and Pollux. The attitude of the figure, which is protecting itself with its shield, in no way reminds us of the impetuous Achilles ; but a circumstance which has always given rise to hostile criticism, is the light clothing of the hero, for English modesty does not accommodate itself to clothing which consists only of a \" figleaf \" and a buckler ! And to say that \"the ladies of England\" put up such a very lightly-clad statue !"], [140, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 128 At the right of this Achilles, and on the other side of the drive, a statue of Lord Byron, by Mr. Belt, has recently been erected. This not very remarkable work is, however, celebrated in consequence of the lengthened law proceedings which the sculptor instituted against one of his fellows, who accused him of not having executed him of not having executed the works which he never- theless signed. Private carriages only have the right to enter Hyde Park, which is in terdicted to all \" hackney coaches.\" The vulgar are permitted to promenade therein, but they cannot enter in cabs. Halte la. And kindly - natured John BuU permits himself to be put down at the gate of the Park which he keeps up with his taxes, to 5IARBLE ARCH. the great satisfaction of his lords and masters. It is above all times during the \" season,\" which lasts from the beginning of May to the end of July, that Hyde Park presents the most entrancing appearance. The trees in full leaf, the flower-beds, admirably kept with that skilfulness and artistic taste of wdiich the Euglish gardeners seem to possess the secret, perfume the air, whicli is almost always stirred by a gentle breeze ; for even in the hottest weather there are sufficiently formidable puffs of cool wind. About nine o'clock in the morn ing, the Ride\u2014 \"Rotten Row\"\u2014 begins to look animated. At this hour there are few ladies on horse back, the men whom we meet are generally merchants, bankers, and lawyers, who take a ride before going to business. Between mid-day and two o'clock \u2014 the lunch hour \u2014 Rotten Row is filled with a crowd HYDE PARK CORNER. of cavaliers and ladies who are of the elite of society. For two hours there is a perpetual stream of equestrians passing and repassing, exchanging a few words with the pedestrians\u2014ladies and gentlemen \u2014 who are leaning on the railings. The women in bright costumes, the men in morning-dress, flower in button-hole, and wearing single eye-glasses. Everybody comes and goes, stops, proceeds, sits down in the chairs which line the promenade ; sometimes there is a general excitement, all heads are turned in the same direction, the men remove their hats, the ladies, generally young and pretty,"], [141, "THE WEST-END. 129 with that somewhat haughty English beauty, assume their most winning smiles ; thc Prince is passing on horseback, smiling, affable. Occasionally, but rarely, the Queen, who alone has the right to traverse the ride in a carriage, passes. The equestrians of both sexes then form up behind her carriage, and compose an escort most imposing in its simplicity, which strikingly testifies to the profound respect with whicli the English people regard their Sovereign. Deserted in the middle of the day, the Park, or rather one avenue of the Park, THE SERPENTINE, HYDE PARK. begins to fill again about five o'clock. Then there is an interminable procession of carriages, luxurious equipages with armorial bearings on the panels, beautifully horsed, which pass and repass up and down the drive in four lines. As in the morning, in the Row, the side walks are filled with an elegantly dressed crowd ; it is the rendezvous of high-life, the fine fleur of the aristocracy. The brilliant toilettes, the colours of the liveries, the panels of thc carriages flashing back the sun-light, the gay hues of the flowers, which contrast brightly with the more sombre verdure of the trees, all form a spectacle unique of its kind, and wliich has no equal in any other capital in Europe. 17"], [142, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 130 One feels one's self in the midst of a special class of people. This luxury, which is displayed on all sides, the exclusiveness of this \"society,\" which, even in a public garden, manages to isolate itself\u2014 and, on the other hand, the respectful timidity, perhaps; but, certainly, the sullenly hostile feeling of the crowd, whicli, posted in the opposite alleys, gives its opinion, not always flattering, upon the appearance of someone who is more favoured by fortune than by nature, are for the foreigner as a peep into a new world, or, THE SERPENTINE, KENSINGTON GARDENS. better still, like a vision of the past, as ofthe time of Louis the XIV. en redingote, and with the chapeau Rembrandt . A fine piece of water, the Serpentine, spanned by a pretty stone bridge, is covered with pleasure boats, and resounds with the joyous cries of a number of swans and ducks. With that love of nature, innate with the Anglo-Saxon, the English have managed to preserve in Hyde Park the country characteristics which are the great attractions of the London Parks. The sheep, the farm, and the cows complete the illusion. One might fancy one's self a huudred miles from the Metropolis. By-the-way, the presence of a powder magazine in the very centre of the Park, seems a measure of doubtful utility, and may cause a catastrophe the very idea of"], [143, "THE WEST-END. 131 which makes one shudder. It is by the magazine that the \"meets\" of the Four-in- Hand Club, and the Coach ing Club are held during the season. On these occasions, it is by no means unusual to see twenty-five or thirty \" drags \" whose splendid teams could not be matched in Europe. As for the skill of the drivers, it is simply marvellous ! Hyde Park has always been the favourite pro menade of the English aristocracy, and owes its popularity to its beauty, CASCADE, KENSINGTON GARDENS. and its admirable situation in the centre of the Metropolis In the last century, Lord Chesterfield, celebrated by the famous letters he addressed to his son, was one of the most regular habitues of Hyde Park. One of his friends, surprised to see him venturing out in his then bad state of health, could not help telling him so. \"My dear fellow,\" replied the witty nobleman, \" I am rehears ing my funeral.\" The monument erected to the memory of the late Prince Consort, the Albert Memorial, is in Kensington Gardens, opposite the Albert Hall. It is a species of spire, about 160 feet high, reposing on four granite columns, and covering a colossal gilded statue of Prince Albert. This statue, which possesses no artistic value, spoils the monu ment, and one instinctively looks for a dial in this enormous gilt mass, which resembles a clock figure. The statue is placed on a base of 130 feet, ornamented with bas-reliefs of remarkable execution, representing scientists, poets, and artists of all nations and periods, and four allegcrical groups \u2014 Commerce, Industry, ALBERT MEMORIAL. Agriculture, and Engineering. Finally, at the bottom of the steps which lead to the monument, we find som' other groups in"], [144, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 132 marble, representing Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. The mosaics, the gilding, the onyx, with which the Memorial is decorated, make it one of the most beautiful objects in London, as much by the richness of ornamentation as by the taste and elegance which distinguish it. The statue only is out of harmony with the rest, and destroys the ensemble. Perhaps some day one more in keeping with the present style of the monument may be substituted. Besides, London does not shine in statuary. There are few statues in public places wliich are not ridiculed by the English themselves, and which do not cause the stranger st. James's park. astonishment. The most terrible of all, without exception, was the stupendous statue of the great Duke of AVellington, with his triangular hat, draped in a cloak of similar triangular form, bestriding a horse cut out with a hatchet. This statue has now been removed from the triumphal arch of the entrance of the Green Park, which served as the pedestal, and has been transported to the camp at Aldershot. A smaller one might be made more worthy of London and AVellington. The Green Park, at the south of Piccadilly, which it borders for more than half a mile, offers nothing particular to our notice. It is chiefly frequented by workmen out of work, and idlers, who come thither and picnic with their children."], [145, "THE WEST-END. 133 It was in the Green Park that Charles II. , accompanied by two gentlemen of his household, met his brother, the Duke of York, attended by a numerous escort. The Duke inquired of the King whether he were not afraid to walk about almost unattended. \"Did not he incur any danger?\" \"None,\" replied Charles, \"for where is the Englishman who would kill me to make you king ? \" St. James's Park, which is next to the Green Park, from which it is separated by a wide avenue called the Mall, extends from Buckingham Palace to the Horse Guards. St. James's Palace, and Marlborough House, the residence of the Prince of Wales, as well as the greater number of the public offices, overlook this park. Herein are some beautiful trees and an extensive lake, in which numbers of ducks disport themselves, PIECE OF WATER IN HYDE PARK. and are watched for hours by the idlers. A reminiscence connected with these \"volatiles\" \u2014 St. Evremond, who had taken refuge in England, was appointed by Charles II. custodian of the water-fowl in St. James's Park. Another reminiscence\u2014 the celebrated gardener, Le Notre, partly designed the gardens by order of the same Charles, who took pleasure in planting and cultivating the trees and flowers himself. Much more extensive than either of the parks just named is Regent's Park, situated in the northern side of the metropolis at the top of Portland Place, which is a con tinuation of Regent Street. It was laid out by Nash, under the orders of George IV., who contemplated erecting a palace there, and it was not opened to the public until 1838. After Hyde Park, it is the largest and prettiest in London ; it encloses the Botanical and the Zoological Gardens, as well as many private residences. A few years hence, when the trees have grown bigger, Regent's Park will be perhaps as beautiful as its celebrated rival, Hyde Park. The south-western portion, where the fine Y-shaped lake is, is the prettiest and the most wooded, and gives an idea of"], [146, "134 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. i what this park, now so unjustly neglected by the upper classes, will in time become. On the other hand, open-air preachers are not wanting, and they are surrounded every Sunday by a considerable crowd, which sings psalms and religious chants in chorus. There is something shocking in the sight of these men, who have no recognised position, installing themselves under a tree and pouring forth an inexhaustible torrent of language, interspersed with quotations from Scripture, to the amazement of the vulgar. Here are four or five, within a little distance of each other, talking of Hell and Heaven to the crowds which encircle them. Is this religion ? or is it business? One cannot exactly say. English people tell you that these unlicensed preachers carry the Divine words to people whom the regular i clergy cannot reach. It is impossible to more strongly characterize the supineness or powerlessness of the said clergy ! The other parks of London are \u2014 Finsbury Park in the north, Victoria Park in the east, and, south of the Thames, Kcnnington, Southwark, and Battersea Parks. The last-named, I which was not completed till 1858, is one of I the most remarkable ornamental features effected I in London during the last thirty years, and I encloses a sub-tropical garden, the aspect of B which during August and September is one of I great beauty.

With the sole exception of Leicester Square, all the London open spaces are, so far as the public is concerned, a kind of Promised Land, which one may walk round and look at, but cannot enter. The best known square, and the one which more nearly approaches what the French call a \"place,\" is Trafalgar Square. Sir Robert Peel, who probably had not been abroad, declared that it was the finest \"place\" in Europe; but the houses which surround it, the statues it contains, the fountains and their miserable jets, with the stone- work by which they are embellished, are all of a ghastly mediocrity. It is bounded on the north by the National Gallery, on the east by an hotel which"], [147, "THE WEST-END. 135 includes four or five houses, on the west by a club-house, and is open on the south side, where several streets converge ; amongst others, Whitehall, at the end of which arc the Houses of Parliament. Trafalgar Square is particularly remarkable for its position, almost in the mathematical centre of the town, and a few paces from Charing Cross. In the middle of the square rises the Nelson Column, on the top of which the too sensitive friend of Lady Hamilton, is impaled upon a coil of rope, the effect of which from behind is as singular as unexpected. At the base of the monument are four lions in bronze, the work of Landseer; and four bas-reliefs, representing the battles of the Nile, St. Vincent, and Copenhagen, and the death of Nelson, atone for the insufficiency of the TRAFALGAR SQUARE. rest. At each corner of tbe square is a pedestal ; three of these are occupied, one by an equestrian st-atue of George IV., the other two by General Havelock and Sir Charles Napier ; the fourth pedestal, deprived of its statue, looks quite forlorn, while waiting for an occupant. The conqueror of Tel-el-Kebir has perhaps a chance ! AA'ho can tell ? Lastly, we need only mention the statue of Charles I., by Le Seur, which occupies a place by itself at the end of AVhitehall, and two fountains placed behind the Nelson Column. Not far from here is Leicester Square, in wliich the Alhambra is situated \u2014 a reconstruction since the fire in 1882. This square, wliich for a long time was the Montfaucon of all the dogs and cats of the metropolis, has for the last twelve years been transformed into an elegant garden \u2014 open to the public this time \u2014 with statues and flower-beds. Mr. Albert Grant, a naturalized German, at his own cost, executed all"], [148, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 136 the work, and generously and unconditionally made a present to the metropolis of the ground which he had purchased. The other squares, distributed pretty equally in all districts, belong to the genus ferme. The principal are Grosvenor Square, Berkeley Square, St. James's Square, Belgrave Square, and Cavendish Square, wliich are inhabited by the upper classes of the aristocracy. There are in the Bloomsbury district a number of fine squares, whicli would occupy too much space to detail ; the largest of all is perhaps the space known as Lincoln's- Inn-Fields, situated in the legal dis trict, between Holborn and the Strand. After the parks and the few squares open to the public, the most agreeable promenades are the Embankments, DUKE OF YORK'S COLUMN. which now skirt the Thames. To obtain an idea of what the Thames shore was formerly, we have only to stand on any of the bridges between Charing Cross Viaduct and London Bridge, and glance at the right hank ofthe river. There used to be on both sides of the Thames nameless buildings, depots of merchandise, and wharves, built on piles, so as to permit the lighters and barges to load or unload direct \u2014 an operation which can now be only performed at one side, above Blackfriars. To these wharves we descended by narrow, dirty and winding ways, wherein from the smell of the filth which then swept down the river were exhaled pestilential odours. Thanks BATTERSEA TARK. to the efforts of the Board of AA'orks and its engineer, Sir Joseph Bazalgette, the three superb quays which now border the river have been constructed within twenty years, and are certainly worth the .\u20ac6,500,000 sterling, which they cost."], [149, "THE WESTEND. 137 The Victoria Embankment, on the left bank, extends from Westminster Bridge to Blackfriars, and is about a mile and a quarter in length. It is a splendid road, thirty yards wide, adorned with gardens to which the public are admitted, and bordered in certain places by some fine houses. Somerset House, near Waterloo Bridge, displays its river frontage on the Embankment. Some statues and the Cleopatra Needle add to the beauty of this drive, which the English justly consider the most beautiful thoroughfare in the metropolis, and the appearance of which, from certain points of view} is remarkably fine. Why should it be per mitted that this splendid avenue leading to the City \u2014 whither no one goes, and whence no one comes at night \u2014 should be at dark a sort of cut-throat thoroughfare, whereon it is scarce prudent to venture, according to the testimony of the police themselves ? It is no use to deny it. In July, 1883, a clergyman was knocked down and robbed by a band of roughs, who followed him from the City. A policeman had warned him ; but, as his beat led him in the direction opposite to that followed by the clergyman, the latter, who, it seems, could not retrace his steps, was set upon and robbed a few paces farther on ! The Chelsea Embankment, also on the ALBERT EMBANKMENT. 18"], [150, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 138 left bank, extends from the Albert Suspension Bridge to Chelsea Suspension Bridge, past Chelsea Hospital. It is the shortest and least important of the Embankments. It is continued, by the Grosvenor Road, along the river to AArestminster. The Albert Embankment is on the right bank of the Thames. It commences at Westminster Bridge and is continued to A^auxhall Bridge. St. Thomas's Hospital and the Lambeth Archiepiscopal Palace, the residence of the Primate, overlook this embank ment, wliich borders one of the most populous quarters of London. From the Albert Embankment a splendid view of the Houses of Parliament is obtained. Between London Bridge and Hammersmith the Thames is spanned by eighteen VICTORIA EMBANKMENT. bridges, five of wliich are railway viaducts, the others are for ordinary traffic. London Bridge, begun in 1825 and completed in 1831, on tbe designs of Rennie, is 834 feet long and 45 feet wide. It is of granite, and has five semi-elliptical arches, of which the centre one has a span of 137 feet. This is the most frequented bridge in the metropolis ; it has heen estimated that in the twenty-four hours more than 20,000 vehicles and about 110,000 pedestrians cross it. At certain times \u2014 particularly between nine and ten a.m., and between four and six p.m., it is almost impossible to cross it, so crowded is it. Close by is the Cannon Street Railw-ay Bridge, which is about the same length as London Bridge. Built entirely of iron, this viaduct rests on sixteen cylindrical pillars, forming five spans, of which the longest is 50 yards, and the shortest 40 yards. Five lines are laid across it. Then comes Southwark Bridge \u2014 a very remarkable one \u2014 consisting of three iron arches of wonderful boldness; the opening of the centre one being 216 feet span, and the others 189 feet each. The Vendome Column in Paris is only 129 feet"], [151, "THE BRIDGES. 1. London Bridge.- 2. Cannon Street Bridge. \u2014 3. Waterloo Bridge. \u2014 4. Chelsea Bridge. \u2014 5. Battersea Bridge. 6.

Blackfriars Bridge, which comes next (with the Railway Bridge of the Chatham and Dover Line on the east side of it), dates from 1869. It is 1144* feet long and 67 h feet wide, supported by five iron arches sustained by granite buttresses. From the centre of the bridge a superb view of St. Paul's is obtained : the enormous mass of the cathedral and its proportions have a fine effect. The immediate proximity of the horrible LAMBETH PALACE. railway bridge \u2014 now supplemented with another \u2014 spoils the view and destroys the appearance of Blackfriars Bridge, the elegance of which is remarkable. AVaterloo Bridge is the handsomest in London. Though less wide than London Bridge, it is nearly twice as long (1,242 feet), supported by nine semi-elliptical arches of 108 feet span and 31 feet high. It is built of Scotch granite, and the piers are each ornamented by two Doric columns, supporting an entablature of Grecian design, above which is a balustrade. John Rennie, the designer and builder of the London and Southwark bridges, constructed Waterloo Bridge, the erection of which occupied from October 11th, 1811, to June, 1817. It was opened on the 18th of that month, the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, by the Prince Regent \u2014 afterwards George IV. If from the centre of this bridge we turn towards the Strand, we have one of the most beautiful views of London that it is possible to imagine. On the right is the City, dominated by St. Paul's. In front is Somerset House ; on the left the pinnacles of the Houses of Parliament, and the towers of Westminster Abbey, stand out clearly ; while the river, wliich here describes a curve, runs rapidly between the Embankment \u2014 trim and decked with gardens \u2014 on one side, and the sombre warehouses and factories on the"], [153, "THE WEST-END. 141 other, the high chimneys vomiting black clouds of smoke, presenting a violent contrast to the monuments of the opposite bank.

This bridge is wide enough for four lines of raUs, and there is room enough for STATUES OF FRANKLIN, LORD CLYDE, AND SHAKESPEARE. GUARDS' MEMORIAL, AND FOUNTAIN IN PARK LANE. pedestrians on the side walks. An addition to this bridge is now being made on the west side. AVestminster Bridge crosses from the Clock Tower of the Houses of Parliament and unites AVestminster with Lambeth. It is a pretty structure, 75 feet wide, and 1,044 feet long, but the elegance is obtained by the sacrifice of solidity : it is supported by seven iron arches, perfectly elliptical, and most graceful in their effect. The other bridges above AVestminster are less noteworthy, with the exception of the Albert Suspension Bridge, which unites Chelsea with Battersea. We may also mention the Battersea (Railway) Bridge, which is said to be the widest in the world ; and the Chelsea (Suspension) or Victoria Bridge close to it."], [154, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 142 VIII. DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE. PRIVATE MANSIONS. \u2014 THE \" HOME.\" FAMILY LIFE. As everyone knows, the Englishman likes to isolate himself. So life in apartments \u2014 \"flats\" \u2014 is almost unknown in London, where every family has its own house. This accounts for the tremendous extent of this metropolis, which is not, like Paris, confined within a girdle of fortifications, and obliged to pile storey on storey to make room for its ever-increasing population. The middle-class English house generally includes a basement, a ground-floor, and two, sometimes three, rarely four, storeys. It is surrounded by a little fosse, whicli permits light to enter the basement, and which serves as the servant's entrance : a railing protects this area. The coal-cellars are placed beneath the pavement, wliich is pierced by round openings, by which the coal is shot into the cellars, and closed by a plate of iron, very slippery and very dangerous in frosty weather : sometimes the plate is not properly adjusted, and gives way beneath the tread, a very excellent method of breaking one's legs ! As regards the exterior of English houses, the architects have not troubled themselves with much novelty of design; a cube of masonry pierced by rectangular holes without mouldings or ornament of any description \u2014 that is, par excellence, the house whicli every Englishman, by reason of some mild, inoffensive kind of madness or mania, calls his castle ! Besides, as these houses are built by the dozen \u2014 even by the gross \u2014 it is not uncommon to traverse some miles between two ranges of houses built upon the same plan without anything to distinguish them from the others. If ennui was one day born of uniformity it is evident that in London it must have first seen the light. \"AVitli a view to break the monotony of the appearance of the houses, some people initiated an idea which was speedily imitated, whicli consisted in painting the fronts of their dwellings red, yellow, brown, or even a deUcate blue. AVhen the houses are detached the result is inoffensive ; but when they are close together, as in Regent Street for instance, where they form an unbroken frontage or colonnade in architectural unison, nothing can be funnier than to see half the front white, and the other half \u2014 which is inhabited by an individual of different tastes from his neighbour \u2014 covered with a most staring red tint. In newly-built districts some attempt has been made to improve the aspect of the houses ; and the fashions of these various buildings may serve to fix the date of each by the styles adopted. AAraterloo Place, Regent Street, Portland Place, and the districts near the Regent's Park, recall the first years of this century by their Greco-Roman colonnades, after the styles of Nash and Decimus Burton. This mode after lasting for fifty years disappeared in favour of the Gothic, which in its turn has been dethroned by the Queen Anne style, which is at present all the rage in the districts inhabited by the \" upper middle \" classes. In these localities we see nothing but red-brick houses with pointed roofs and gables, the narrow and inconvenient entry being a vaulted porch at right angles to the frontage. Kensington offers many examples of these whimsical constructions, whose windows glazed with tiny panes of glass, set in"], [155, "THE WEST-END. 143 deep wooden frames, only permit the entry of a small quantity of light, as if the fogs did not already sufficiently intercept the pale rays of the sun which reach England. Some princely habitations, the mansions of the nobility or financiers, are exceptions to the general rule, and deserve special mention. The majority of these are situated at the West-End, and chiefly in the vicinity of the Parks. There are in Piccadilly, Devonshire House, the mansion of the Duke of Devonshire \u2014 much more deserving of HANOVER TERRACE. notice for its fine gardens than for its own aspect ; Bath House (No. 82) belongs to Lord Ashburnham, one of the members of the great Baring family, the celebrated bankers of world-wide celebrity; the mansion of the Rothschilds (No. 146), looking upon Hyde Park, and, finally, Apsley House, the residence of the Duke of AVellington, at the Park Gate. In Park Lane, the thoroughfare whicli borders Hyde Park on the East \u2014 of which one side only is occupied by houses \u2014 we remark Dorchester House, a very elegant building in the Italian style, and one of the most beautiful in London ; and a little higher up is the mansion of the Duke of Westminster, the entrance to which, beneath a handsome colonnade, is in Grosvenor Street."], [156, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 144 Lansdowne House in Berkeley Square ; Stafford House, belonging to the Duke of Sutherland, in one of the Courts of St. James's Palace; and Bridgewater House, whose beautiful facade faces the Green Park, are remarkable for their appearance, their galleries of paintings, and collections of \" objects of art\" of priceless value. Amongst the historical mansions there are two which can by no means be passed in silence. The first, situated in South Audley Street, is the mansion of the celebrated Lord Chesterfield, whose rooms have been preserved in the same state as he described them, but which can only be visited with a special order from the present owner. The second is Holland House, picturesquely situated in a beautiful park to the West of Kensington. There died Addison, who had married the widowed Countess of Warwick. The house was HOLLAND HOUSE. purchased afterwards by Henry Fox, father of the celebrated Charles James Fox, who subsequently became Lord Holland. From 1820 to 1840 the literary assemblies of Lady Holland acquired universal celebrity, and Macaulay, one of the intimates there, mentions amongst those who frequented it, Talleyrand, Lord Melbourne, Byron, Campbell, Lord John Russell, Hallam, Sydney Smith, and many other persons illustrious in the world of art and letters. Holland House is now shorn of its splendour, the park has already been cut up, and in the near future nothing but a memory of Holland House will remain. Let us now enter into an English house and see the \" home.\" To judge dispas sionately of it, we must not penetrate either into the mansion of the millionaire, or into the cottage of the poor ; the house of the doctor, the barrister, or the City merchant, will either of them suffice for us. Such we may find everywhere, in the centre of London as in the suburbs inhabited by the upper middle class, at Hampstead, Kilburn, Maida A7 ale in the North, and Blackheath, Sydenham, and Norwood in the south. The interior"], [157, "THE WEST-END. 145 arrangements vary but little\u2014 a hall with the staircase beyond, a dining-room and one or two other rooms opening from this entrance hall. That is the ground floor. The dining-room, usually hung with pictures, is of good size, and simply furnished with a side-board supporting a glass ; a table, chairs, and easy chairs of mahogany, and nearly always covered with leather. The massive and heavy pieces of furniture have an appearance of solidity, in harmony with the somewhat severe aspect of the house ; they are large and comfortable, but they would A. f~A<-_ .r 1 -a. -r. \u25a0 \u2022 ..... . \u2022 ,-, scarcely suit Parisian apartments, in which space is so parsimoniously measured. APSLEY HOUSE. Are you fond of carpets ? They are laid everywhere. From the staircase to the drawing-room ; from the kitchen to the nursery \u2014 the flooring disappears under the oil-cloth, the Turkey or Persian carpet, or the simple drugget, according to the taste and means of the proprietor. On the other hand, the hangings, curtains, and portieres are not numerous even in the sitting rooms, which are invariably situated on the first floor. The drawing-room is divided into two rooms, the smaUer of whicli is the boudoir of the lady of the house. By opening or shutting the large folding doors, one can have two rooms, or one at pleasure. The furniture of this \u2014 the most carefully kept apartment of all \u2014 is often of walnut-wood, the most favoured in England, and covered with silk, damask, or rep. For some years, now, the fashion has existed for subdued colours \u2014 green tones or old gold, flowered papers, plush frames.

The English woman can decorate her house better than she can manage it. On all sides, on little tables or etageres, disposed with premeditated disorder \u2014 articles past which it is sometimes difficult to make one's way \u2014 are statuettes in porcelain, bronzes, nicknacks, English, French, and German books and reviews, for the English are tremendous readers ! They also cultivate music, and the grand piano, which extends across the corner of the room, encumbered with musical scores, sentimental romances, and ballads, 1TAIRCASE, HOLLAND HOUSE. such as our fathers loved, testifies to the fondness of the English for music and singing. A great many young ladies, now-a-days, relinquish the piano for the violin, which has lately become the fashionable instrument. On Sundays, sacred music, vocal and instrumental, replaces, in most English houses, the operatic melodies and the' \"profane\" ballads, which are only permitted on week-days. The bed-rooms occupy the second storey. They are simply and even sparsely furnished. An iron bedstead, a wardrobe with three doors, and a complete and extensive washing-stand, accompany a few chairs, a carpet, a table, and that is all. The bed-room in England is a necessity ; it is not, as in France, a soft-lined nest, a delicious place of retreat in the long winter evenings; and where, with curtains drawn, the feet on the andirons, reclining in a luxurious chair, one may resign one's self to sweet confidences or"], [159, "THE WEST-END. 147 delightful reveries. In a word, the English apartment is, as its name indicates, a bed room ; one sleeps, but one does not live there. Finally, in the upper storeys are situated the servants' rooms and the nursery. There is, in the latter apartment, the least possible amouut of furniture, but rocking-horse, chamber gymnasium, toys, and chairs of well-proved solidity, which serve, in turns, for \"castles\" or \"railways\" for the joyous children who, up there, enjoy full liberty under the watchful eyes of the nursery-maid. When the children grow a little older, she gives place to the nursery governess, who commences to educate them, and teaches them to read, until the time when she is herself succeeded by the governess. From that time the DINING-ROOM. nursery is transformed into the schoolroom, and the wooden horse is replaced by lesson-books. It, of course, often happens that nursery and schoolroom exist simul taneously in the same house. The kitchen and \" offices \" occupy the basement, in which the butler or the cook reigns supreme. There is in the English domestic arrangements a hierarchy, which is strictly observed. The functions of each servant are clearly defined ; and the cook would rather cut herself limb from limb than open the street door to a visitor \u2014 a duty which appertains to the housemaid. The latter, on her part, would not boil an egg, although the whole household were starving ! In noblemen's establishments, this amounts almost to a regular etiquette, and, to get an idea of it, one must read English novels or study the comic papers, whose witticisms on the subject are inexhaustible. In families where there is no butler, the housemaid waits at table \u2014 by no means a sinecure, for meals are"], [160, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 148 frequent ; and the English are more difficult to please in the way in which their meals are served than in the preparation of them. Without repeating Talleyrand's joke respecting the one sauce, and the many religions of the English, we may nevertheless affirm that the English cooking entirely lacks variety. But it possesses the advantage of being wholesome, and the transformations which Continental cooks effect in one and the same dish, by disguising it under more or less' curious names, is rendered impossible. Soup, roast or boiled meat, fish, vegetables, puddings, pies, and fruit tarts, are the Alpha and Omega of the national cookery, which is not complicated, and yet which it is difficult to find well per formed \u2014 so little taste have the English housekeepers for the art of Vatel. From what, by the way, arises the fixed French idea that the English like their meat raw ? Nothing can be less accurate; for it is they, on the contrary, who are always complaining, when on the Continent, that the meat is not sufficiently cooked. Certainly it is a grave error to offer an Englishman very un derdone meat with the idea that thereby you are pleasing him ; and Frenchmen would do well to ponder this, before inviting their friends across the Channel to dinner. Revenons aux repas. The first is breakfast, which takes DRAWING-ROOM, DORCHESTER HOUSE. place between eight and ten in the morning, at which all the members of the family, except the very young children, assemble, before the departure of their father for his business. At one or two o'clock is luncheon, which is the children's dinner. At this meal the mother of the family presides in those middle-class families which we have selected as our type of modern English life. Tea is served at five o'clock \u2014 a friendly repast at which visitors frequently assist. But it is for the dinner at seven or eight o'clock that all the luxuriance and show is reserved. Paterfamilias, on his return from the City, from his chambers, or from"], [161, "THE WEST-END. 149 the official world, puts on his evening dress; his wife and elder children being all in regulation toilettes. They proceed to the dining-room, where the napery is bewil deringly white, the glasses scintillating, the silver polished to a pitch of brightness unparalleled ; the flowrers on the table give it a festive appearance, an air of prosperity, of comfort, under the bright light of the lamps or the gas. Conversation proceeds in calm tones, the voices are always at the same diapason; no loudness, no bursts of laughter, no quick repartees are launched across the table from one to another. Every one listens to whomsoever is speaking, and answers are made in measured tones, without any noisy declamation. English people have no idea of the little pleasant \" touch and go\" butterfly chit-chat which flutters about every subject, but rests on none, as thc French have. This kind of conversation is too much for the Britisher; it worries him ; but when the conversation becomes fixed upon a subject \u2014 no matter whether it be literature, art, or politics, he proves himself a person of original thought, well informed, and possessed of tbat kind of cool wit, of a somewhat pungent nature, which is not without its charm, and is called \" humour \" ! After dinner the men proceed to the smoking-room, and afterwards rejoin thc ladies in the drawing-room, where the evening is spent. Etiquette, concerning wliich the English are very punctilious, and the long distances which they have to traverse, render evening visits rare except amongst intimate friends. The ladies pay their calls during the day, between four and six o'clock upon week days. Sunday has a tendency to become, amongst certain classes of Society \u2014 artistic and literary circles \u2014 a day for unceremonious reunions. On that day each individual calls, chats a little, goes away, or remains to dinner, according to the degree of intimacy he enjoys. In the evening there may be music \u2014 not sacred music \u2014 to the great scandal of the Philistines, as the Puritans of the lower middle- class are called, who are rigid observers of the Sabbath, and look upon the opening of Museums on the Lord's Day as a sacrilege. In fine, the English middle-class life is, as one sees it, calm and smooth \u2014 even monotonous. The unforeseen has no share, or very little share, in it. Parties to the theatre and dinners are affairs meditated and prepared a long time in advance. Once he returns home, the Englishman never goes out again till morning, unless he is absolutely obliged to do so ; as for the promenade pure and simple, it is very much like the \" chit-chat \" \u2014 he has no idea of it ; he goes out or he walks, he does not \"promenade.\" There is no exact equivalent in English for the verb promener. IX. THE THEATRES ! COVENT GARDEN. \u2014 DRURY LANE. HER MAJESTY'S THEATRE. THE LYCEUM. THE ENGLISH DRAMATISTS. \u2014 FRENCH PIECES. \u2014 THE MUSIC HALLS. MADAME TUSSAUD's WAX-WORKS. Forty theatres contend every night for the favours of the London public, which is very fond of theatrical and other performances, and quite an amateur in respect of the"], [162, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 150 great melodramas wherein Virtue triumphs and Vice is punished, according to the good old-fashioned rule. These theatres are generally of good size, and the best places \u2014 the stalls and dress circle \u2014 everywhere excellent, but rather dear. The price of an orchestra stall varies from seven-and-sixpence to half-a-guinea in fashionable theatres (comedy or drama) ; the boxes vary in price, from one to eight guineas. The inferior places\u2014 balcony, upper circle, pit, amphitheatre, and gallery \u2014 are suited to all purses ; the dearest are seven and-sixpence or six shillings, and so down to one shilling, or even sixpence. The opera is exorbitant \u2014 one guinea, and twenty-five shillings being the price for a stall. As for the private boxes, they are from two to twelve guineas ; a box on the grand tier costs for the season ,\u00a3240. At all the theatres ladies are admitted to the orchestra stalls, and at the opera and in the best theatres evening dress is essential. The private boxes are not open as in the French theatres, but shut in and furnished with curtains. Even in public the Englishman likes to be private, and to feel \" at home.\" When the curtain rises the gas in the house is turned down, which is not a bad plan, as the stage appears better lighted; nevertheless, the semi-obscurity which prevails in the English theatres is not pleasant, and gives them a sombre and gloomy appearance. The ventilation of the English theatres is pretty good ; the seats are spacious, and the passages less encumbered than in France. Some managers have abolished \" fees,\" and put an end absolutely to gratuities. In place of an old grumbling female, a young attendant supplies the perfumed programmes to the spectators gratis. Think of that, O ye Parisian managers ! The principal theatres are in the Strand and neighbouring streets. In the first rank we must place Covent Garden, the third of the name \u2014 the two former ones having been burned in 1808 and 1856. The present building, reconstructed in 1858 upon the plans of Barry, hks the same dimensions as La Scala at Milan. The facade, 114 feet long, consists of a portico supported by columns, 60 feet high, ornamented by statues and bas-reliefs by Flaxman, which were fortunately recovered from the flames. Carriages take up and set down under the portico, which gives access to a splendid crush room, from which rises the wide staircase leading to the boxes. The theatre, which is simple, and capable of containing 2,000 people, is painted a pale blue and white, with mouldings and gilded ornamentation. The seats are wide and com fortable, while there is space sufficient between the rows of chairs to admit of moving without bruising one's knees. In Covent Garden the Opera, always sung in Italian, is housed during the ten or twelve weeks of the season. To the Opera succeed the Promenade Concerts, and at Christmas they are replaced by the traditional Pantomime, or more lately by a circus-company. A propos of the Opera, why are the English the only people in Europe who do not sing in their native language ? It is said that the English tongue does not lend itself to singing. This is a mistake ; in any case, it is quite as harmonious as German ! There is, it is true, a troupe of English Opera- singers, but it is directed by a German, and the majority of the artists are foreigners. Her Majesty's Theatre, in the Haymarket, has also for some years produced Italian Opera at the same time as Covent Garden, but, like"], [163, "THE WEST-END. 151 practical people, and after considerable losses had been sustained by both sides, the managers united forces, and London has now only one Italian Opera. Drury Lane Theatre, situated close to Covent Garden, is\u2014 so 'tis said\u2014 the oldest theatre in London, although it only dates from 1812; and as all statisticians tell us that the average life of a theatre is only twenty-four and a-half years\u2014 exactness, as well as statistics, is a beautiful thing\u2014 and that at the expiration of that period it must expect THE STRAND. to be burned down, Drury Lane has lived beyond its allotted \u00ab * span. It is one of the most beautiful, and one of the finest stages in the metropolis ; as it is now the only one which unites the present with the past, by the immortal memories of actors and actresses who have performed on it : in fact, it was at Drury Lane that the Kembles, Kean, Braham, Farren, Macready, Madame Vestris, Helen Faucit, and Ellen Tree became renowned by their incomparable talent, and threw around the English stage a halo, the memory of which only remains. It is only fair to add, that, during the last few years, there has occurred in England a sort of renaissance of dramatic art, on which the example of French dramatic artists has had some influence."], [164, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 152 Successively a theatre, a hippodrome, and a concert hall, and after having served as a menagerie for Van Amburgh's lions, the success of which exceeded that of Macready, Drury Lane was transformed into an opera house in 1867. After twelve years or so, the Italian Opera performances ceased ; and now melodrama and military spectacles, like those of the old cirque in the Boulevard du Temple, are performed. As one may judge, Drury Lane has had a somewhat chequered existence, and the number of managers it has ruined is considerable. However, the present lessee seems to have conquered the bad fortune w-hich formerly attached to the theatre, the future of wliich seems assured. The architecture of Drury Lane is absolutely insignificant. For some time, opera was played at Her Majesty's Theatre, which is in the Haymarket. Since its reconstruction, in 1869, the career of this theatre has been as short as unfortunate. It has attempted everything. Italian Opera, English Opera, Religious Meetings, Comic Singers, American Minstrels, and Comic Opera, have suc ceeded each other with equal non- success. The foremost theatre of the drama is the Lyceum, which is in Wellington Street, Strand, near Covent Garden. Rebuilt in 1834, after a fire, this theatre had Balfe, the composer, for its occupant ; he played English Opera, to which succeeded a circus, and to that Mrs. Keeley's company. Mrs. Keeley was one of the best of modern actresses, and her company gave excellent representations, which reaped great success. After vicissitudes, which it is needless to recapitulate here, the Lyceum feU into the hands of a great actor, who is also a manager of rare ability, Mr. Henry Irving. Under the intelligent guidance of this talented gentleman, to whom is due, in great part, the progress which British Dramatic Art has made within the last few years, the Lyceum started on a fresh career of prosperity, the success of which is brilliant and profitable to the manager. He has succeeded in forming a company of recognized merit, whose perform ances are followed and appreciated by a discriminating public. The dramas, and, above all, the tragedies of Shakespeare are represented at the Lyceum with a \" go \" and ensemble which no other English theatre can reach. They are mounted with a luxuriousness and a care for detail, an exactitude of costume, and a completeness wliich denote a remarkable knowledge of the resources of the theatre placed at the services of conscien tious artists careful of tlieir reputations, and devoted to their profession. So the efforts of Mr. Irving have received the most flattering recognition from the public, and it was rumoured that he was offered a knighthood, a dignity which he had the good taste to decline. This offer, if it was ever made, is very significant, and shows plainly that the prejudices, wliich so long militated against an honourable profession, have now com pletely been swept aw-ay. The Haymarket and St. James's Theatres, situated, the former in the thoroughfare whose name it bears, and the latter in King Street, St. James's, are near Her Majesty's Theatre. These two houses \u2014 one lately under the management of Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft, the second under that of Messrs. Hare and Kendal\u2014 are dedicated to the performance of modern English comedies, and particularly to adaptations of French pieces translated, and sometimes mutilated, by English playwrights, who make a speciality of this class of literature. Actors of talent as well as inteUigent managers,"], [165, "THE WEST-END. 153 Messrs. Bancroft, Hare and Kendal, have, like Mr. Irving, largely contributed to raise the level of English Dramatic Art. By the judicious selection of plays, the care with which they are produced, and the personal share which these gentlemen take in the performances, they richly deserve the favour they enjoy, and the success which, for twenty years, has never failed them. Amongst the other theatres, the most important are the Adelphi and the Princess's, and in less fashionable quarters the Britannia and Marylebone Theatres, where melodrama is performed. The smaller theatres are numerous. The modern English theatre is dependent on the foreign, and almost en tirely on the French stage. Dramas, comedies, operettas \u2014 all the reper tory of the last fifty years are translations, adapta tions, and often mutilated French pieces. In tragedy England has a master \u2014 Shakespeare, but except at the Lyceum, what theatre ventures to produce the works of this sublime genius ? Not one ! Still it is only lately that the taste for Shakespeare has revived, and in the opinion of many people, the modern actors are still far behind their iUustrious predecessors. COVENT GARDEN THEATRE. England, so fertile in poets and novelists, has also her dramatic authors, but they only occupy a secondary position in her literature. No doubt she has produced the greatest of all \u2014 Shakespeare ; but what, beside this giant, are Beaumont and Fletcher, or even Ben Jonson, his contemporaries ? and after all, what of their works remains to this day ? The memory ! Later, Wycherley, Congreve, Farquhar, Southerne, and after them, Cibber, and Mrs. Centlivre, produced agreeable comedies, which are faithful pictures of the manners of the periods; but in the greater part of them, there is a licentious tone which makes their production impossible nowadays. This is to be regretted, for their pieces, written with spirit, originality, and with qualities of observa tion by no means common, deserve a better fate than to be forgotten. During the 18th century, a group of dramatic authors wrote and produced a great number of works not devoid of merit, but they were soon eclipsed by the comedies of 20"], [166, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 154 Goldsmith, the two Colmans, and Sheridan, the Ulustrious author of \" The School for Scandal,\" that master-piece of wit, satire, and animation. But with these great names, the last scintillation of a brilliant period, the dramatic literature of England seems to have expired, for in the 19th century, we do not appear to have seen a single dramatic author, except Robertson (the writer of some comedies, the excellent interpretation of which did more to render them successful than their intrinsic value warranted), and Bui wer Lytton. French pieces, adapted or translated, have always to be subjected to alterations necessitated by the demands of the British public, which does not like to see certain passions depicted on the stage. In order to disembarrass them of their \"essentially French\" character, the adapters excise, and introduce changes not always happy, and entirely alter the construction of the pieces, which often appear but of average merit, and wliich are unrecognisable by their authors. The critic bitterly bewails this low standard of dramatic art, and lays the blame on the managers, reproaching them for only playing foreign pieces. This is all very well, but dramatists cannot be improvised, still less a National Theatre, and in art matters the State holds itself quite aloof \u2014 so the managers between bankruptcy and foreign plays do not hesitate for a moment. One cannot reaUy blame them. As it is estimated that more than 300,000 persons frequent the various places of amusement in London every evening, it is evident that the theatres can accommodate only a small proportion of these pleasure-seekers. So the concert rooms, music-halls, and entertainments of kindred nature are very numerous ; and it is very difficult to ascertain exactly their number. Some people say there are 400 or more. However, that may be there are in every district some of these establishments designated \" Halls \" or \" Rooms,\" in which, all the year round, are given varied amusements, concerts, conjuring, displays of magnetism, &c., known in England under the general name of \" entertainments.\" The most extensive of all these buildings is the Royal Albert Hall in South Kensington, facing Kensington Gardens. It is an immense oval-shaped building of red brick, around which runs a terra-cotta frieze, a style of decoration which is reproduced on the fa\u00a3ade ; the architecture of the \" Hall \" is not imposing, and were it not for its mass it would not attract any particular attention. The interior is 219 feet in diameter in its extreme measurement, and 185 feet in the smallest. The gigantic proportions of the Albert HaU have been partly the cause of its non success, for under no circumstances can it be filled. It is calculated to contain 8,000 people, and as public ceremonials, which alone attract the multitude, are rare in London, the Albert Hall has always the appearance of being empty. A fine organ, which cost \u20ac10,000, is placed above the orchestra, in which there is room for 1,000 instrumentalists. Much better situated than the Albert Hall, and of more reasonable dimensions, is St. James's Hall, with entrances in Piccadilly and Regent Street. It was built in 1857, after the designs of Owen Jones, and at once attained a popularity which has never since waned. We may also mention St. George's Hall, Exeter Hall, and particularly AVillis's Rooms, wherein were formerly held the Almack Balls, which were exclusively"], [167, "THE WEST-END. 155 limited to the \" upper ten \" of English society, under the direction of a committee of ladies of the highest rank. At present AVillis's Rooms are let for balls, soirees, concerts, and assaults of arms. The Music Halls are curious : the principal are the Oxford, the London Pavilion, the Canterbury, the Metropolitan, and the Alhambra. As in similar establishments on INTERIOR OF ALBERT HALL. the Continent, the visitors drink and smoke while they listen to songs more or less comic or sentimental, delivered by men clothed in eccentric costumes, and by ladies in ballet skirts. A very curious individual in the music hall is the Chairman, or president, who, armed with a hammer like an auctioneer, and correctly attired in evening suit and white tie, is seated facing the audience, with his back to the stage. It is he who plays the part of an animated programme in announcing the artistes, who gives the signal for applause, or for its moderation, by striking the table with his hammer, and who maintains order in the hall. The true British dignity with which the Chair man pronounces the solemn words, \" Order, please, ladies and gentlemen ! \" is most refreshing. Finally, amongst the places of amusement open every evening is the Aquarium, a glass-roofed building in whicli numerous entertainments succeed each other \u2014 acrobats, singers, conjurors \u2014 all to the strains of a fair orchestra. The large space reserved for"], [168, "156 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. promenaders serves as a place of meeting for the class which the suppression of public baUs has driven to the Aquarium. We must not omit from our list of London amusements the wax-works of Madame Tussaud, whose reputation is European. Founded in Paris in 1780, the museum was transported to London in 1802 by its proprietor, who did not locate herself there definitely until 1833, after having traveUed through England and Ireland. Since then the success of the exhibition has never wavered. It contains, amongst other curiosities, the counter feit presentments in wax of Wellington and the first Napoleon, Henry VIII., and his six wives, as weU as very excellent portraitures of Queen Victoria, and all the members of the Royal FamUy. All the Sovereigns of England are assembled in one particular gallery, termed the \" Hall of Kings.\" The Napoleon Chamber contains an interesting collection of objects which formerly belonged to the Emperor, as weU as portraits of the Imperial family. The popularity of the Tussaud exhibition is in a great measure due to the rapidity with which the important personages of the day \u2014 the latest Sovereign, the coming poHtician, the fashionable artist, or the most horrible murderer \u2014 find themselves figured in wax. Frequently the image is clothed in the very garments of the living person \u2014 a great attraction this for numbers of visitors. X. THE CLUBS : THEIR ORIGIN. \u2014 CLUBS ANCIENT AND MODERN. \u2014 LITERARY CLUBS. DISRAELI, BULWER LYTTON, THACKERAY, DICKENS. There are Clubs almost everywhere, it is true; Paris, Vienna, and St. Petersburg have theirs, but there is no city in the world in which they are so numerous, or play such an important part, as in London. Nowhere else does Club-life occupy such a considerable place in the customs of a people ; and this fact is not surprising when we consider that this profoundly egotistical institution is essentially of British origin. Whoever is \" anyone,\" and anyone who wishes to become \" somebody,\" must belong to a Club. To belong to such and such a club is equivalent, according to circumstances, to a badge of merit \u2014 political, literary, or artistic \u2014 and always a certificate of perfectly honourable principles. The man who is \" black-balled \" in a high-class club will find attached to his name a sort of moral reprobation, and feel himself touched on a point of honour. Have we not lately seen a candidate, whose brother occupies a prominent position in politics, bring an action against a member to whose influence he attributed his rejection at a certain club? It was a conspicuous maladresse. The judges displayed much tact and cleverness on that occasion. They declared themselves unable to pronounce an opinion. They could do nothing else. This shows the importance of clubs whose political and social role is not one of the least of the curiosities of modern English Use."], [169, "THE WEST-END. 157 The origin of these establishments is of considerable antiquity. In the 15th century there existed a club called \" La Court de bone Compagnie,\" but it was not until towards the end of the 17th century that the first real club was established in the City under the name of the Civil Club. Formerly people used to meet together at the taverns and coffee-houses, some of which are still celebrated; but the English hankering for solitude accorded ill with these establishments, which were open to every new comer, and the friends soon proceeded to hire a room, and afterwards a house, in which they could meet privately : and at last to erect those immense stately buildings which at the present day occupy two of the most beautiful streets in London \u2014 PaU Mall and St. James's Street \u2014 and are amongst the most imposing edifices of the me tropolis. In Queen Anne's time men spent in the clubs most of the day, or rather of the night, talking, eating, and drinking. The club was then a viva voce newspaper, and there jokes, anecdotes, and scandals passed from lip to lip. Under the Regency the clubs were exclusively aris tocratic. In them people ARMY AND NAVY CLUB. played, betted, and quarrelled, and were \" paraded \" for a mere trifle. One day at Brooks', Adams took offence because Fox declared the Government powder was bad. Adams, who was in charge of this supply, was annoyed, and challenged Fox ; the result was a duel. Adams fired first, and Fox being wounded, refused to return the fire. The seconds interfered, and the principals shook hands. \" Adams,\" said Fox, \" if that had not been Government powder I should have been a dead man ! \" In the prosaic and utilitarian age in which we live the clubs have changed their manners. There are no longer duels, quarrels, or extravagant bets. In place of those traditional rubbers at which one was ruined in a single night, some whist tables are set out, where the players risk moderate stakes \u2014 except in one or two clubs where the stakes are very considerable. The modern club is before all else a place of meeting, either for politicians or \u2014 and there are a great number \u2014 for gentlemen of small means, who there find incalculable advantages. For the bachelor, the officer of slender income, tbe club is a home, a mansion furnished in princely style, in which one"], [170, "158 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. can live luxuriously without spending more than one can afford. Mr. Walker, an English author, has put the case concisely :\u2014\" Every member is master, without any of the trouble of a master ; he can come when he pleases, and stay away when he pleases, without anything going wrong ; he has the command of regular servants, without having to pay or manage them . . . having no interest to think of but his own.\" AVhat, then, becomes of the family life ? Is not the home deserted for the club ? PALL MALL. No ! Both institutions stand side by side without interfering with each other. If bachelors pass their lives, so to speak, at tlieir clubs, the married men make their appearance there less frequently. For some ofthe latter the club is, however, a refuge ; instance a gentleman who used to pass all his nights watching the game of piquet. One morning a dispute arose and the players appealed to the \" gallery,\" which then consisted of the solitary individual, an attentive spectator, who declared he did not know one card from another. \" What the deuce are you doing here then at such an hour as this ? \" asked one player. \" Gentlemen,\" replied the spectator, \" I am a married man.\" For the most part, the club is a pleasant place, where one hears the news and is placed au courant with the scandals of society. AVhat one hears in these Httle conversa tions would suffice to fill a newspaper and make the fortune of a reporter. It is the general opinion that from the mihtary clubs emanate most of the \" stories \" which go"], [171, "THE WEST-END. 159 the rounds of society ; and that it is in the manufacture of \" tittle-tattle \" that the officers devote themselves in the intervals of studying the service journals ! There are clubs political, aristocratic, miUtary, university, professional. Amongst the first are the Carlton, the Reform, and Brooks'. The two first-named, recalling \" the palatial homes \" of Italy, are in Pall Mall ; the last in St. James's Street. Arthur's, AVhite's, and the Turf Club have no political character ; tlieir object is but to bring idle and lounging men of the world together. In past days high play ATHEN\u00c6UM CLUB. was indulged in at White's, where men betted on anything or nothing. Births, ',__-' deaths, and accidents, were all made the - i _ subjects of wagers. It is related that one y ' - ' day a man fell down dead at the door, and his decease was immediately made the sub- ject of bets. Fortunately for him, he was dead, for those who had betted on his death declined to permit him to be bled, on the ground that their chances of winning would be thereby diminished. The officers of the Army and Navy have a great number of clubs pertaining to the services ; the chief of which are the Army and Navy, the Naval and Military, the United Service, and the Guards' Club; the members of the last-named club are exclusively officers of the Household troops. There are many others. The Army and Navy Club is one of the finest and most luxurious in London."], [172, "160 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. St. James's Club, in PiccadUly, is almost exclusively frequented by members of the Diplomatic Corps and Foreign Office functionaries. It is renowned for its excellent cookery, which is greatly appreciated by the fastidious gourmets who use the club. They are not of the class who, like the diners at Crockford's, would complain to the committee that the cook had put onions in the Soubise sauce. The United University Club, the Oxford and Cambridge Club, and one or two others, are meeting places for former students of the two Universities. The actors have the Garrick Club situated conveniently at a short distance from Covent Garden and the theatres. This club contains a collection of portraits of the principal English actors \u2014 a collection formed by the celebrated Charles Mathews, who bequeathed it to the club. Some clubs \u2014 the Albemarle and the Lotus, for example \u2014 are \"mixed,\" and include both men and women amongst their members. This experiment, frequently tried, has never succeeded. On the contrary, clubs exclusively for ladies seem to prosper, although they have only a very diminished importance. Every year new clubs are formed ; but these enjoy but an ephemeral existence. This is fortunate, for the greater number of these are disguised gambling-houses, whose disappearance is a benefit to the community. The History of the Literary Clubs has never been written in a complete form, which is a pity, for such a work would be of great interest, from all points of view. It may be, without exaggeration, asserted that the history of these institutions is intimately connected with that of English literature ; and even that it is impossible to speak of one without speaking of the other. It \"goes without saying\" that literary clubs originated with meetings at the taverns. The most ancient of these societies is that which assembled at the Mermaid Tavern, in the City. Founded by Sir Walter Raleigh, the favourite of Elizabeth, it was the rendezvous of all the wits of the period. There Beaumont and Ben Jonson wittily encountered each other. Shakespeare, if tradition is to be credited, formed one of the coterie, as well as Fletcher, the collaborateur of Beaumont. Carew, Selden, Cotton, Donne, and a considerable number of the literary men of that period, assiduously frequented the Mermaid Tavern, which was destroyed by the Great Fire of 1666; but its memory is imperishable, thanks to the verse which Beaumont addressed to Ben Jonson : \u2014 . . . . \" AVhat things have we seen Done at the Mermaid ! \" At the commencement of the 18th century, Swift, the illustrious author of \" Gulliver's Travels,\" established a club which he called the Scriblerus Club. The object of this society of men of letters was to criticise and turn into ridicule contem porary savants ; and it must be confessed that the members were quite equal to their mission. One may judge by this : by the side of the Dean of St. Patrick's were Oxford, Arbuthnot, St. John (afterwards Bolingbroke) ; and Pope, the author of the \" Dunciad,\" that scathing satire upon the literary Bohemia of his time, which he has depicted with as much realism as Hogarth displayed in painting it with the precision and crudeness so characteristic of the English pictures of the period. Gay, who wrote some charming"], [173, "THE WEST-END. 161 fables and the celebrated \" Beggar's Opera,\" was also a member of the Scriblerus Club. But, before long, under the influence of political passions, this little band of literary men dispersed, and, as Sir Walter Scott said, \"talents so various, so extended, and so brilliant, can never again be united.\" The Kit-Kat Club was more prosperous. Without being absolutely literary, it was frequented by too many celebrated writers to be passed by in silence. There the brilliant staff of the Spectator was united; Addison at the head. Congreve, the dramatic author, posed there as a gentleman. There Dryden extolled Milton to the clouds; Vanburgh, architect, poet, and dramatic author, joked with Kneller the painter; and in listening to them Garth, the doctor, forgot his patients, and Steele \u2014 his wife. Sir Joshua Reynolds, the Presi dent of the Royal Academy, who was in the habit of assembling at his house a circle of literary men, statesmen, and artists, one day conceived the idea oi forming a society to bring these varied talents together. He confided it to his friend Dr. Johnson, who assisted him in the realization of his project. Thus the Literary Club was founded, which was originally composed of nine members only. Goldsmith and Edmund Burke were amongst these, but John son objected to the admission of Garrick \u2014 his friend, too ! \u2014 on the plea that he would disturb the meetings by his buffooneries. Later on Johnson BULWER LYTTON. gave way, and Garrick, to his great joy, was admitted as a member of the Literary Club, as well as Colman the elder. This club, whose existence has been prolonged to our day, has reckoned amongst its members Gibbon,, whose \"History ofthe Decline and FaU of the Roman Empire\" has been translated by M. Guizot; Hallam, Sheridan, Canning, Reynolds, Chambers, the architect of Somerset House ; Sir Charles Eastlake, who was also President of the Royal Academy ; Lord Brougham, and Macaulay. The establishments of which we have been speaking, and many others of less importance, were not clubs in the modern sense of the term. They were reunions held on appointed days in certain places, generally in taverns or coffee-houses. AA^hen officers of the army, men about town, and members of the Universities already had their own clubs, the literary men and artists, who had in some sort invented them, were still at the commencement of this century, and even as late as 1824, reduced to meet in taverns. Struck by this inferiority, and by the inconveniences which resulted from it, a certain number of learned and literary men founded a club exclusively for the use of the 21"], [174, "162 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. literary and artistic, which was first named the Society Club, a name soon afterwards changed to that now celebrated \u2014 the Athen\u00e6um Club. The Committee was composed of Sir Humphrey Davy, the celebrated chemist ; Wilson Croker ; Lawrence, the artist ; Chantrey, the sculptor; Lord Aberdeen; the \"bibliomaniac\" Heber; Sir Walter Scott; Thomas Moore, the poet ; and the secretary was the illustrious Faraday. AVhat a golden record is that of the Athen\u00e6um ! All the literary and artistic glory of England during the first part of the 19th Century is contained in it. We have already mentioned Moore, the anacreontic poet, whose verses have all the viva- city and ardour of the Irish genius, united with the sarcastic spirit of Dryden, and the delicate taste of Pope. Let us again mention Sir Walter Scott, the singer of Mar- mion, the creator of the historical romance, who by an effort of genius carried this class of litera- ture to perfection, and at the first flight raised himself above all rivals. Who has not read those Waverley Novels, so powerful in interest, so poetic and so perfect, which gained for the author the title of the \" Wizard of the North \" \u2014 Scott, the Magician ? DISRAELI (LORD BEACONSFIELD). A strange contradiction of genius; for this man, who has resuscitated for us feudal Scotland with a marvellous fidelity, was only a sorry arch\u00e6ologist, for whom Rome was \"a fine city, but in ruins;\" and who, on returning to Abbotsford, said, \"I have seen many things, but nothing to equal my own house ! \" The historians were represented at the Athen\u00e6um by Grote, whose History of Greece is a \" monument of science and erudition \" ; and by Macaulay, who has left us such a faithful and so interesting a picture of England in the 17th Century, and his remarkable essays, masterpieces of criticism, style, and good taste, of which M. Guizot has given us a translation as pleasant to read as the original \u2014 and one can assign to it no greater praise."], [175, "THE WEST-END. 163 Besides Faraday, whom Sir Humphrey Davy considered \"his greatest discovery,\" Wheatstone and Darwin were included in the constellation of scientists who illuminated the club. Amongst the artists, Maclise, the famous painter, whose frescoes embellish the House of Lords, and Sir Edwin Landseer, the most celebrated animal painter whom England has ever had, were the most worthy successors of Lawrence and Chantrey. The novelists were numerous. Disraeli, the elder, author of the \" Curiosities of Literature,\" preceded his son, the author of \" Vivian Grey,\" the appearance of which was a master-stroke. Bulwer Lytton, afterwards Lord Lytton, a talented writer of novels, a mid dling poet, a successful dramatic author, and a politician in his leisure hours, must figure in this gallery of illustration. Of a nervous temperament, of a suspicious mind, and obstinate, it is, above all, as a novelist that he excels, aud has given proofs of an original talent and prodigious activity. His first novels \u2014 \" Pel ham,\" \" Devereux,\" and \"Paul Clifford,\" violent satires upon the aristo cracy \u2014 indicated a pro found knowledge of men, and of the world, and placed him at once in the THACKERAY. front rank of the novelists of his time. Nevertheless, he did not represent the English spirit in the same degree as Thackeray and Dickens, who embodied all that is most characteristic of the national genius. Thackeray began life under favourable auspices. Brought up as a gentleman destined to enjoy a handsome fortune, he successively travelled through Germany, Italy, and France, where he applied himself to art, which he cultivated with fervour. At the age of twenty-three, when ruin came upon him and forced him to choose a career, he threw down his palette aud pencils to grasp the pen which he continued to wield till his death. His first appearance as an author was beset by difficulties. He began by satirising English society, which somewhat resented his raillery, particularly when it emanated from an unknown man, as he then was ; and the \" Book of Snobs \" rubbed"], [176, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 164 the British fur the wrong way. To this is attributable the cynical reputation which has unjustly been fastened on him, and the trouble which he had to make himself known. It was not until he had published \" Aranity Fair\"\u2014 that is to say, after thirteen years of stubborn work\u2014 that his reputation was definitively established. From that time he was considered a master of his craft, and the \" Society,\" which he had depicted with so CHARLES DICKENS. much exactness and audacity \u2014 for he had dared to tell the truth to its face \u2014 bore him no ill-will. It would have been bad taste had it done so, for Thackeray wrote like a gentleman, and possessed the art of saying what he had to say with pleasing gracefulness. His style, vigorous, warm, and highly-coloured, has a piquant flavour, a particular savour of its own. His fine raillery, full of humour, is that of good society, and never descends to vulgarity. AA'ith what art in \" Aranity Fair\" he has depicted that adventuress, Becky Sharp, that demon of feminine perversity, and how he follows her in"], [177, "THE WEST-END. 165 her descent down the slope on which she slips, without permitting a word to escape his pen, which the most delicate-minded lady reader could object to. God knows it was easy to lose himself on the way ! AVhat real living characters are Becky the intrigante and Rawdon Crawley her husband ! But we come in contact with the types daily \u2014 \"Vanity Fair\" is true for ever. And that curious figure \u2014 the old debauche, Lord Steyne, do not we meet him in our daily walks, buttoned tightly in his frock-coat, with his airs of the old beau, his painted complexion, and his ferret eyes wdiich intimidate women? Thackeray was also a speaker of considerable merit, and a draughtsman of talent. In the Ulnstrations to some of his works, and in the designs which he has furnished to the pictorial journals, he has shown us that he could wield the pencil almost as weU as the pen. Dickens, more fortunate than his friend Thackeray, met with success at his first step into literary life. He was only twenty-four when his \" Sketches by Boz \" drew atten tion to him. What Thackeray did for the aristocracy, Dickens did for the lower classes and the \"people.\" No one has ever seized upon and depicted so well as he the eccentrici ties and the qualities of the lower middle-classes; their humility before the great, and their hardness towards the little people \u2014 with all that, charitable and surly, hard-working and extravagant \u2014 perverted under the veneer of affected austerity. His most characteristic work \u2014 FARADAY. that which contains the germ of and sums up all the others\u2014 is \" Pickwick,\" a series of pictures of manners rather than a novel. But what pictures! Pickwick is the synonym for John Bull. Follow this fat man through aU his adventures, and you have a striking photograph of the English character. He causes to pass successively before the charmed, absorbed, it may be startled, reader\u2014 the soldier, the lawyer, the journalist, the politician, the actor ; every one passes as in a kaleidoscope. In the harrowing scenes of the debtors' prison, where laughter is mingled with tears, the author puts his finger on English misery \u2014 that hideous plague spot which eats into the vigorous British society, as some maladies attack sound, healthy bodies. An attorney's clerk in early life, he draws for us, with rare skill, a picture of that other plague-spot, so much the more formidable, as it reaches everyone under cover of a tardy legislation: the dishonest band of lawyers of a low class, who are always on the look-"], [178, "166 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. out for a scandal \u2014 master-swindlers who make use of the law to practise tlieir honest calling \u2014 is as numerous as ever. Only, the Dodsons and Foggs of to-day are much more formidable than their predecessors; they have advanced with the age, and are too clever to permit themselves to be caught. Unfortunately, \" Pickwick \" is untranslatable into French. It loses, in the process of translation, three-fourths of its charm and truth to nature. Like the state of things which it represents, it cannot be understood without preliminary study, which is not within the reach of everybody. The style of Dickens is unequal; sometimes rising to the height of poetry, to descend afterwards to triviality; slang is mingled with academic phraseology. AVith unequalled skill the author adapted his style to the class to which he introduces us, and thus gives to his scenes a truthfulness, a colour, a life, a verisimilitude, wliich are marvellous. Dickens, like Thackeray, was pitiless for the weaknesses of his countrymen ; but what made one feared, the other popular, was this : in Thackeray each one is recognised by himself; in Dickens every one has recognised his neighbour. Both authors have left an imperishable work \u2014 not only the most perfect repre sentations of English society as it was in the first half of the 19th century, but, more t'.ian that, a faithful picture of the national character. So long as the English language is spoken their works will be as true as they are now, as they were yesterday. When that New Zealander, of whom Macaulay has spoken, sits pensively regarding the ruins of London, the immortal works of Dickens and Thackeray will revive for him the memory of a vanished race ! XI. SPORT. RACE-COURSES. \u2014 THE DERBY. \u2014 CRICKET AND FOOTBALL. LAWN TENNIS. \u2014 BICYCLES AND TRICYCLES. The term \" Sport \" \u2014 a very elastic one \u2014 embraces all sorts of open-air amusements : riding, hunting, fishing, gymnastics, swimming \u2014 in a word, all the exercises which bring the physical faculties into play, come under the denomination of \" Sport.\" To enumerate the British sports would require a volume, for the list is indeed a long one. From the schoolboy who plays cricket and football, to the great lord or land owner who hunts, or shoots grouse on his Scottish moors \u2014 all Englishmen interest themselves in these eminently national pastimes. Without counting special newspapers, Sport occupies an important place in all journals, under the heading of \" Sporting Intelligence.\" The races which take place from one end of the year to the other are for the masses excuses for betting and speculation. The English are a gambling nation ; if they have not a passion for cards they certainly have for play, for in all amusements they find means to gratify their taste for speculation. An Englishman loves to risk his"], [179, "THE WEST-END. 167 money ou a horse or a foot-race, on a cricket or a football team, or on a swimmer, a sculler, or a bicyclist \u2014 even on a boxing-match ! Lord Palmerston called the Epsom Races, where the famous \"Derby\" race is run, the Isthmian games of England. In fact, the Derby Day is the national fete of the English. On that day Parliament does not sit, and, though the warehouses and shops are open, the City is deserted. \" AH the AVorld and his AVife,\" as the English say, go to Epsom, either by raUway, or in carriages, or in spring vans, dr \" hansoms.\" It is an unique sight, this procession of 100,000 persons passing, one fine day in May, along the dusty THAMES REGATTA road which leads to the race-course. From the costermouger, seated in his \"barrow,\" drawn by a donkey, to the duke and the peer, who value tlieir teams at a thousand pounds sterling, all classes of society, all professions, all costumes, are represented there. On the course itself is a veritable Saturnalia, a Carnival without the name. The motley crowd, noisy, gross, and brutal, permits itself every excess in language and liquor. The pickpockets, the betting men, the \" negro \" minstrels, descend like a swarm of flies upon their food ; those who have not been ruined by betting are pretty sure to be robbed by the light-fingered gentry, who reap a harvest on Derby Day, when heads and legs are not very trustworthy after copious libations. An English crowd, when it is let loose, loses all restraint, it becomes wild, its bursts of excitement are characterised by an amount of recklessness which makes one shudder to think what such a populace would become in a riot. These men and their companions have the appearance of brutes, their eyes, illumined by the gleams of intoxication, flash ferociously. Animal life is overflowing in them, and it seems that an explosion of anger in such creatures would be produced by the slightest concussion. Beside such people, over-excited by enjoyment"], [180, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 168 and drinking, the ladies and gentlemen who contemplate them from the vantage-ground LAWN TENNIS MATCH. of their carriages, cool and disdainful, have somewhat the air of \" tamers \" in a cage of wild beasts. And the race? But the race is the least interesting part THE RAC of the Derby Day. To the foreigner, this file of horses, the varied parti-coloured shirts"], [181, "THE WEST-END. 169 of the jockeys, who pass by like a whirlwind, are far from presenting the same interest as the popular and curious scenes, so novel withal, which one can only witness in England \u2014 and then only once a year ! The Derby, which was established in 1780, is run invariably on a AVednesday at the end of May or the beginning of June ; and two days after is the Oaks, which has not the same popular characteristics as the Derby. The race-course is beautifuUy situated some fifteen miles from London, near Epsom, a small town once celebrated for its FOOT-RACF.. mineral springs, but now quite gone out of fashion. On the Downs, an immense \"stand\" of three stages has been erected, in which 5.000 people can find room, and obtain an admirable view. Epsom is served by the South Western and the London and Brighton Railway Companies. On days there are special trains about every ten minutes. As, with the exception ofthe Derby, the horse-races in England bear a family resemblance to those in other countries, it is really only the former which is worth the trouble of seeing. But, if one wishes to see something novel, one must go and witness a match of cricket or football. Cricket and football matches \u2014 both essentially national games \u2014 have an irresistible attraction for everyone. The principal London matches take place at Lord's Cricket Ground \u2014 so called from the name of the original proprietor, Mr. Lord \u2014 and at Kennington Oval. It is in July that the most interesting matches take place between the elevens of Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and between Eton and Harrow Schools. The latter match is much the most popular, and attracts the largest crowd. For many weeks beforehand people discuss the relative chances of both \"teams.\" The illness of one of the eleven gives rise to the greatest anxiety. The most \"steady going \" journals devote leading articles to matches past or to come. \" Old boys \" crowd to \" Lord's \" on the occasion of the match ; and the day is generally wound up with a liberal distribution of amenities between the partisans of the rival schools. The game of cricket is a modification of the old game of crosse. It is played with 22"], [182, "170 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. a ball, wickets, and a wooden bat with which the player must stop or strike the ball delivered by his opponent, whose object is to disarrange the wicket of the batsman. The balls used are very hard, and the contusions received on heads and limbs are too numer ous to mention. But, if cricket has its dangers, football is absolutely barbarous. The violence, the savagery, which are displayed by the opponents in this British sport are, according to the English them selves, shameful. It is heart-rending to see the groups of youths, even of men, rushing down upon the player who holds the ball, like a pack of hounds CARRIAGES AT THE DERBY. upon a wild boar. This is a struggle in which kicks and blows play a conspicuous part. Every year this game claims a relatively large number of victims. It has been sought to render it less dangerous by establishing new rules ; but the young Englishmen, who like to make a parade of their powers of endurance, that is to say, of their astonishing faculty for enduring blows, prefer the game in all its savagery. Scratch the Englishman and you will find the barbarian, who loves to fight, and delights in giving to his amuse ment a smack of danger. Boxing is still a favourite pastime with Englishmen, and is now, as a rule, practised only with gloves. But even with these restrictions, considerable punishment may be inflicted. The athletic clubs occasionally give displays of boxing; the heavy, middle, and light-weights being all well represented. There are few Englishmen who do not know how to use their fists : their first weapon of defence is the clenched hand \u2014 a formidable one, too, if the person is acquainted with the \" noble art of self-defence,\" as the English call the science of pugilism. The brutal prize-fight has almost entirely"], [183, "THE WEST-END. 171 disappeared from England; but boxing with gloves, and school encounters, are common to all classes of Englishmen and boys. For some years two new pastimes have been added to the already long list of these amusements. These are lawn tennis and velociped ing. Like cricket, lawn tennis is of French origin \u2022 it is le jeu depaume, revised and corrected. It is a graceful game, which developes the muscles, and has the advantage of bring ing together young people of both sexes. It really deserves its popularity. Moreover, it is an aristo cratic game, for the popu lace do not appear to have taken it up. As for the bicycle, it has become a perfect nuisance. The streets are filled with these machines, which come running along THE WINNER. at a high rate of speed, to the great danger of pedestrians and vehicles, for the horses are alarmed at the machines; and, as if this were not enough, the tricycle has been invented. This is a kind of seat supported by three wheels, which are set in motion by treadles. There are tricycles with one or two seats \u2014 a new danger to add to those, already so great, of the London streets. Gymnastics, foot races, and bicycle races are very popular sports. In the spring the principal meetings are held, the most interesting of which are those at Lillie Bridge Grounds \u2014 a kind of race-course and cricket-ground, belonging to the Amateur Athletic Club, and at the Stamford Bridge Grounds, the property of the London Athletic Club."], [184, "172 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. XIL THE RAILWAYS: STATISTICS \u2014 ACCIDENTS. \u2014 CLAPHAM JUNCTION. \u2014 THE TERMINI. THE METROPOLITAN RAILWAY. \u2014 OMNIBUSES. \u2014 TRAMWAYS. \u2014 CABS.\u2014 STEAMBOATS. England enjoys a most perfect system of railways, as anyone may convince himself by a glance at a map. There are nearly 20,000 miles of lines opened, and the number of passengers conveyed annually by the various companies is estimated at more than 745,000,000. As usual, the State does not interfere, save in the inspection of the railways, particularly with a view to the safety of travellers. According to the report of the Board of Trade, the number of persons who suffered from accidents on the railroads in 1881 reached a total of 1,096 killed and 4,564 wounded; that is, 1 killed out of every 5,760,740 passengers carried, and 1 wounded in 335,577. These figures include not only the individuals killed or wounded in the trains, but also those employed on the lines, and the travellers, victims of their own imprudence, as well as suicides, and would-be suicides, etc. The number of travellers who were the victims of accidents, properly so called, during the same year, was 23; the wounded numbered 993. The total number of railway servants killed reached 585, the number of wounded 2,446. As will be seen by the foregoing, railway accidents are uncommon, and, considering the enormous number of passengers carried, and the speed of the trains, comparatively slight. The total receipts of the various companies were, in 1881, \u00a366,557,000; and they distributed in dividends more than \u00a312,000,000, or about 4] per cent, on their subscribed capital. As to the nominal capital, it amounts to more than \u00a3750,000,000 sterling. The receipts show a constant increase, which is due to the very great facilities offered to travellers by the companies, who continue to improve their rolling stock, and to watch over the convenience and comfort of their passengers with remarkable care. There are very few English lines on which the third-class carriages \u2014 roomy, well ventilated and lighted \u2014 are not furnished with cushioned seats and backs. The miserable \"cattle-trucks,\" still in use on the French lines, are, happily, unknown in England to the present generation. To these conveniences, no doubt, the number of third class passengers is due \u2014 a number which has doubled itself in ten years, while those of the second-class diminished sensibly ; the number of first-class passengers remained about the same. Thc Midland Railway has removed its second-class carriages entirely, and runs only vehicles of first and third class. It is probable that this example will ultimately be foUowed by all the other lines. The journeys are accomplished more rapidly than in France, and the express trains are not exclusively devoted to first-class passengers. Trains are frequent on all the"], [185, "THE WEST-END. 173 hues, and always made up of sufficient carriages ; so that it is not necessary to pack into each compartment the greatest number of human beings in the least possible space. Nine trunk lines have their starting-points in London. These are\u2014 the Great AVestern; London and North-Western; Midland; Great Northern; Great Eastern; London, Chatham, and Dover; South Eastern; London and South AVestern; and London, Brighton, and South Coast. Each of these companies possesses a suburban network of lines, which cross and SAINT TANCRAS STATION. recross each other; running overhead, diving underground, or passing over viaducts of extraordinary elevation, and converging upon two junctions \u2014 AVillesden Junction on the north, and Clapham Junction on the south; and tlieir appearance is striking. As far as the eye can reach, and in all directions, there are nothing but long lines of rails, crossing and recrossiiig, forming an immense net of steel meshes. In the evening the parti-coloured lamps of the signals present a most picturesque sight, and one would fancy one's seisin a town illuminated for a. fete. AVhat a continual movement there is at these junctions! More than 1,200 trains pass Clapham Junction daily, of which about 1,000 stop to take up and set down passengers; the remainder run through without stopping. It is impossible to arrive there at any time without seeing many trains either stopping or rushing past. For nervous persons this cross-road of iron-ways is a formidable locality ; nevertheless, the precautions are so well taken, the system of signalling so ingenious and so perfect, that"], [186, "174 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. accidents seldom occur. In their manner of working railways the English display unparalleled skill. A few years ago, an American, charged with the management of one of the largest lines in the United States, came over to study the English railway system, and was invited to enter one of the signal-boxes at Clapham Junction, to make himself acquainted with the working of it. After an experience of two hours he came out again, declaring that he would go mad if he remained there longer. For some years past the majority of the companies have caused vast termini to be built; some of these are veritable monuments. Almost aU the lines have several stations in different parts of London. As, by a very ingenious arrangement, the same station serves for several lines, travellers have the inestimable advantage of entering the train almost at their own doors, no matter where their destination may be. The English termini bear little resemblance to the French ; they are, for the most part, immense glazed galleries, into which the lines run, separated from each other by wide platforms for arrival and departure. On the right or left, or at the end, we find the booking-offices and waiting-rooms. Everyone enters and goes out as he pleases, and seats himself in a compartment as soon as he arrives. By this means one avoids the confusion and disorder which are caused in France on the departure of every train, thanks to the system still followed on many lines, which consists in shutting up the passengers like dangerous animals, and only releasing them at the last moment. On arrival, the cabs and carriages are ranged alongside the platform parallel to the train. The travellers then have only to step from their compartments into their cabs, without the least trouble. For the last twenty years it has been customary to erect a monster hotel at each terminus, to whicli it thus forms a facade. These hotels are very useful to traveUers who only pass through London. They are very comfortable, and, as one finds one's self on the spot whence the trains start, there is no necessity to rise at unholy hours to catch the morning express. Many English people who live in London sleep the night before their departure at these hotels, so that they may be sure to catch their train in the morning. Amongst the most remarkable raUway termini, we must mention Charing Cross and Cannon Street stations, wliich are, however, outdone by that at St. Pancras, belonging to the Midland Railway. This deserves a -special description. AAThen we have passed under the hotel of Gothic design which forms the facade, we find ourselves in an immense nave of iron and glass, the proportions of which appear worthy of the architects of the time of Sesostris. The terminus, of pointed design, is 210 yards long, 72 wide, and 30 high. It is supported only by iron girders of single spans, without one column or intermediary pillar. Under this colossal glass roof are eleven lines of rails, with platforms, and a cabstand eight yards wide. To maintain that this terminus is pleasing to the eye would be too much to say, but, as a tour de force of construction and boldness of design, it is incontestably one of the most astonishing things that the art of the engineer has produced. The Liverpool Street terminus, wliich pertains to the Great Eastern Railway, is larger and more elegant. However, that of the Great Western, at Paddington, is stiU,"], [187, "THE WEST-END. 175 of all the large termini in London, that which presents the best proportions, and the best arranged from all points of view. The other railway stations have no particular characteristics ; they all resemble each other in their interior arrangements, whicli have already been indicated above. The Metropolitan Railway was commenced about twenty-three years ago. At that time the means of communication between the City and the AVest-End had become quite insufficient, and the necessity for new ways was imperative. To cut new streets STATION (METROPOLITAN RAILWAY). was not to be thought of; that would be too costly a remedy; and then the idea of a subterranean railway, which had been vaguely discussed, was adopted. The Metropolitan Railway now forms the smaller of the two circles of which the Metropolitan system, properly so called, is composed ; these are named, respectively, the Inner and Outer Circles, both upon the left bank of the Thames. The former is an underground line, which lately started from AIdgate, in the City, and ended at the Tower of London ; but the Circle is now complete. It runs through the regions of King's Cross, Regent's Park, Paddington, Kensington, Chelsea, AVestminster, the Strand, and the City. Some figures will give an idea of the extraordinary utility of this underground line, which carries more than 50,000,000 of passengers annually, or about twice the number of the whole population of England. From 5.15 a.m. until midnight \u2014 that is to say, in about nineteen hours \u2014 there circle round the Metropolitan Railway more than 350 trains, or about one train in every four minutes. This is bewildering ! However, notwithstanding the innumerable difficulties of the traffic, so great is the care observed, and so well is everything organized, that it is very seldom an accident occurs."], [188, "TTR LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. The stations generally consist of a small building, in which there is a booking office; a staircase leads to the platform, which is lighted by gas, and receives daylight from the street by ventilating shafts lined with white glazed bricks. At each end of the platform is a tunnel, black and yawning. This is the railway. Movable signboards indicate to the traveller the destination of the expected train, and three large notice boards, bearing respectively the inscriptions, \" AVait here for first class,\" or, as the case may be, second or third class, determine the spot where the carriages of the classes named will be found when the train stops. The train runs in at a rate of speed which one does not usually associate with a stopping train; but the powerful brakes soon bring it to a standstill. Then everyone rushes in or out, for stops are here counted by seconds, and the train starts again with all the doors open. AA'ith surprising dexterity, a porter and the guard from the plat form shut them all as the carriages pass by without missing one ; and then the guard slings himself into his van when the train has already attained its maximum speed, thanks to the special construc tion of the engines in use. The difficulties which presented themselves in the making of this underground line were aU surmounted by Mr. (now Sir John) Fowler, the able engineer of the RIVER STEAMER. company, with rare good fortune. So all these subterranean lines are legitimate objects of admiration for the foreigner, who is surprised at the energy and tenacity of the English, who triumph with the greatest ease over material obstacles reputed unsurmountable! However, they have not yet been able to render the air pure in the Underground Railway, and the passengers complain of it with reason ; it is, in fact, charged\u00b0 with fumes of sulphur and steam, which are very deleterious. Notwithstanding the ventilators and the blow-holes, the atmosphere of the Metropolitan Railway, in certain portions of the line, is positively intolerable. A remedy is being sought, and, let us hope, will soon be found. After the railways, the omnibuses and tramways are the chief popular means of"], [189, "THE WEST-END. 177 locomotion. The London omnibuses were, and stUl are, for the most part, very incon venient vehicles, in wliich twelve persons, packed like herrings in a barrel, are suffocated for want of air, thanks to the ingenious precaution wliich the company has taken to fix the windows, probably with a view to prevent discussion amongst the passengers. The fares, which are generally the same for inside or outside places, vary, according to distance, from one penny to sixpence ; but the system of correspondence is unknown. The London tramways resemble those north of Paris, witb outside seats in addition. As in the omnibuses, the fares vary according to the distances, and are the same outside or inside. At present the tramways are not permitted to penetrate into the heart of London. The drivers and conductors of omnibuses and tramway-cars do not wear uniform, but they carry, as the cabmen do, badges, with their numbers inscribed thereon, suspended by a leather thong. Some drivers are dressed quite Hke gentle men, wearing good hats, light overcoats, and flowers in their button-holes. They all wear gloves. London is the worst furnished city in Europe with respect to public vehicles. There are no victorias in summer, no little coupes in winter, but HANSOM CAB. villainous and uncomfortable things, called cabs, an abbreviation of the word \" cab riolets,\" as 'bus is short for omnibus. The English Hke to economise syllables. There are the two-wheeled cab and the four-wheeled cab. The former is the most extra ordinary vehicle which the human brain ever conceived. To an architect, named Hansom \u2014 whence the name Hansom cab \u2014 this inconvenient machine is owing; its disadvantages are many, and its merits are still to be discovered. The cab goes fast, they say. Granted. But it will not go fast unless the horse be a good one. Harness him to a more com modious vehicle, and he will go at least as fast. As for the four-wheeled cab, it is simply detestable ; add to this the risk of contracting some serious illness (for these cabs are used to carry patients to the hospitals at times, in defiance of the laws and police regulations), and you have, perhaps, the secret of the popularity of the Hansom cab, with which one is obliged to content one's self, for want of a better. The fares vary according to distance, and the number of passengers in the four wheeled cabs. The proper fare is sixpence a mile, or part of a mile, for two persons ; but under two miles we cannot give the cabman less than a shilling, even if we have only driven a few yards in his cab. To all these means of locomotion we must add the small river steamers which pass to and fro on the Thames between Chelsea and London Bridge ; and those which, starting from the latter point, go down the river to Greenwich, Woolwich, and Gravesend. 23"], [190, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 178 XIII. THE MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION. THE MAIN DRAINAGE. \u2014 THE WATER AND GAS SUPPLY. THE POLICE. THE FIRE BRIGADE. \u2014 THE COMMISSIONAIRES. London, as we have said, was originally that portion of the existing metropolis now called the City. The City of London had its own municipal organization, as represented by the Corporation, whose attributes and privileges still remain almost intact. As the population increased, the small towns and villages surrounding the City were fused together ; and though all of them formed a compact agglomeration of houses and streets, each had, nevertheless, its own municipal organization. This confusion of powers has survived to the present day, although an effort was made to remedy the state of things by constituting vestries and the Metropolitan Board of AATorks by Act of Parliament in 1855. This was a step in advance, but of such little practical utility that the Government has had under consideration a project for municipal reform with the object of bestowing on London a Central Administration. The vestries, forty in number, are local committees, the members of which, called vestrymen, are elected by the ratepayers of the different parishes. To these vestries appertain the duties of paving, lighting, and cleansing the streets, or the portions of streets, within their jurisdiction ; also the inspection of houses, the removal of nuisances, etc., within their respective boundaries. The Metropolitan Board of AArorks is composed of forty-five members, elected by the vestrymen. It is charged with the management of the drainage, the bridges, and the parks, the control of the operations of vestries, the opening up of new streets, the improvement of the metropolis, and, finally, with the direction of the Fire Brigade. But as this Board has not the same authority in the City as in Arestrydom, it finds itself at every turn checked by the Corporation, and the conflicts of opinion which arise daily render its task very difficult. The first business of the Board of Works was to undertake the establishment of the gigantic system of drainage, destined to obviate the poisoning of the population by the pestilential exhalations of the Thames, into which formerly all the sewers discharged themselves. Twice in every twenty-four hours the tide stirred up this mass of putrefying matter, to the great clanger of the inhabitants, and the rising waters drove back into the sewers the filth, which remained there until the next tide. Such a state of things could not be prolonged without grave danger, and the engineers were called upon to remedy it. After an examination of the various plans proposed, that of Sir Joseph Bazalgette was adopted. Here, in a few words, is the project which is now in operation. Beneath the old sewers vast collectors or tunnels have been established, wliich receive the contents of the existing conduits. Upon the left bank of the river there are three parallel lines of these collectors, situated at different levels, which debouch into a single ' outlet in"], [191, "THE WEST-END. 179 Barking Creek. There, at high water, the sluices are opened, and the tide carries off the sewage into the deep sea. On the right bank the pipes discharge their contents at Erith. At the point of convergence the collectors are 9J feet high, and 12 in diameter, of dimensions sufficient, it would seem, to meet the daily increasing necessities and the outcome of thc overflow rainfall. As there are many levels, and some collectors are too low to permit of the natural outfall of the sewage, it has been found necessary to establish pumps to force it from thc lower to the higher level, after the disinfection has been accomplished. One of these pumping stations is in Chelsea, the other is at West Ham on the east of London. The length of these collectors is 85 miles, and the total cost of the system was a SECTION OF EMBANKMENT (CHARING CROSS). SHOWING METROPOLITAN RAILWAY, ALSO OLD AND NEW SEWERS. little more than \u00a34,000.000 sterling. To recoup this expense, a tax of threepence in the pound on the rateable property of the metropolis was imposed. Water is supplied to London by eight companies. The supply for each house is on the average 32 gallons. This water, without being absolutely pure; is nevertheless potable and wholesome enough. Of the 150,000,000 of gallons daily supplied, 67 millions are drawn from the Thames, 59 from the Lea, and the New River, an artificial water course, whose source is 38 miles from London, and the remainder from Artesian AVells, sunk by the companies. There was lately a scheme proposed for buying up the Water Companies, but a counter project, whicli has a good chance of being adopted \u2014 inasmuch as it would be less costly, and secure for London absolutely pure water \u2014 consists in procuring water from one of the Welsh lakes. As early as 1803, a German, named Winsor, employed gas as a mode of lighting the Lyceum Theatre, but it was not until 1807 that this new method was adapted to the lighting of the streets. As a commencement, one side of Pall Mall was first illuminated,' seven years after, in 1814, gas was in general use,"], [192, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 180 There are in London four companies which possess the monopoly of lighting the metropolis with gas. Thanks to the climate, the English consume an enormous quantity for lighting, heating, and cooking. The price is about three shillings and sixpence per thousand cubic feet. Like the Water Companies, the Gas Companies are compelled to permit their clients to share in the profits by reducing the price of gas when the dividends exceed a certain limit. It is estimated that 38,000,000 of cubic feet is the quantity consumed daily by the 1,200,000 lamps which line the metropolitan thorough fares. There are two bodies of police in London\u2014 the Metropolitan and the City Police. The latter force, consisting of about 800 meu, is exclusively employed in guarding the square mile of territory which owns the jurisdiction of the Lord Mayor. The Metropolitan Police, who are charged with the security of nearly 5,000,000 of persons, number 12,000 effectives, of whom 200 are mounted. The force is directed by a functionary \u2014 almost always a retired mili tary officer \u2014 who is called the First Com missioner of Police. The head-quarters of the Force in London FIRE ENGINE. are in Scotland Yard, Whitehall. This little army is composed of 20 divisions, designated by letters of the alphabet; and a special division charged with river inspection, called the Thames Division. The policeman is clothed in deep blue garments, and a helmet covered with cloth of the same colour; he is armed with a staff which is carried in a leathern case suspended from his belt. He is, moreover, possessed of a \" bull's-eye \" lantern ; a waterproof cape ; and a whistle, by means of which he can summon his companions' to his assistance in case of attack, or give the alarm in the event of fire, &c. The policeman's duty is far from being a sinecure, particularly at the East-End of town, where the docks are\u2014 a region inhabited generally by a very mixed population. He ii unrivalled in the management of the street traffic, very obliging, particularly to women and children, whom he assists over the dangerous crossings, and is always ready to impart all the information in his power. AVe will close this subject with a few statistics. In 1881, the Metropolitan Police arrested 7 7,000 individuals, of whom 3,700 were sent to the Assizes, and the other"], [193, "THE WEST-END. 181 73,300 were brought before the police magistrates, who sentenced 51,000 and discharged the remainder. The number of drunken persons arrested by the police during the same year amounted to 18,721, and as the police only charge those who are incapable of taking care of themselves, it is evident that the national vice is not sensibly diminishing, not withstanding all the efforts of Temperance Societies and others. The number of disappearances was 177; of dead bodies found, whose identity could not be ascertained, TO THE FIRE ! there were 54; of persons accidentally killed in the streets, 127; and the number of lost dogs \"run in\" by the police was 17,545. In this city, where every year there are at least 2,000 fires, without reckoning chimney-fires, which are twice as numerous, it is only natural that the equipment of the Fire Brigade should attract the special attention of the authorities. So nothing has been left undone to perfect its organization, which only totals\u2014 one will scarcely credit it\u2014 550 men, recruited, for the most part, from the seafaring class. It is an essentially civil body. Notwithstanding their small numbers, the firemen, whose devotion and skill are above all praise, are sufficient, thanks to the perfection of their equipage and organization, to protect against the most terrible of scourges, the city in the world"], [194, "182 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. most notorious for the ravages of fire. There are in London 53 stations, amongst which the following equipment is divided, viz., 153 fire engines, of which 38 are steam engines, besides three floating steamers for river service in the docks, and for the warehouses bordering the Thames; 137 fire escapes mounted on two wheels, and placed every even ing in position at various points throughout the metro polis, each under the care ofa fireman; 44 waggons and two tug-boats, as well as a large number of horses. To keep up the communication between the different stations, there are about 160 miles of telegraph wire in use, and a dozen special telephones; finally, there are now in all districts fire alarms, in which the pressure of a button will warn the neighbouring stations in the event of fire. The expenses of the Brigade amount to \u00a353,400, of which \u00a316,000 are furnished by the Insurance Companies, whose interest it is to prevent Conflagrations; \u00a310,000 by the Government, and the COMMISSIONAIRE. remainder by the ratepayers. To give an idea of the rapidity with which the Fire Engines arrive at the scene of a fire, it will be sufficient to recall to mind the burning of the Alhambra, in December, 1882, when 28 FIRE BRIGADE HEAD-QUARTERS.\u2014 FIRE ESCAPE. steam fire engines came from all parts of the town, and were at work in Leicester Square in less than an hour. The head station of the Fire Brigade is in Southwark Bridge Road. In concluding this review of the public servitors, let us sketch the London Com-"], [195, "THE AVEST-END. 183 missionaire, who bears no resemblance to his confrere on the other side of the channel. An old soldier or sailor, decorated with a medal, and often mutilated, the English Commissionaire only carries letters and light parcels; he is dressed in a dark uniform, and is in attendance at certain specified places. He is an honest and faithful servant, who deserves every confidence, and whom many merchants and public companies hire by the day to act as messenger or door-keeeper. One has the advantage of having a man upon whom one can reckon, and dressed in uniform, which in the eyes of many people, is an advantage. XIV. THE PUBLIC CHARITIES: THE POOR-RATE THE WORKHOUSES \u2014 PRIVATE CHARITY. THE HOSPITALS : THE FOUNDLING \u2014 CHELSEA HOSriTAL. Before the dissolution of the religious orders, the Monasteries received the poor and indigent, but when the suppression of the Convents deprived these unfortunate beings of tlieir places of re fuge, the authorities of the period could find no other remedies than scourging, im prisonment and death for mendicants and the poor. Towards the end of the reign of Henry VIII. 38,000 persons were put to death for the crime of mendicity ! In the reign of Elizabeth, a law obliged each parish to levy a tax in aid of the destitute, while making those work who were capable of it, and giving house-room to the infirm and aged. From this the name of AArorkhouses was bestowed BETHLEHEM HOSPITAL (BEDLAM). on these establishments. The tax for the poor is called the Poor-Rate; it is paid by householders on the value of the premises they occupy. In towns the poorest quarters are the most heavily taxed, because they have the greatest number of poor to assist. Thus an inhabitant of St. Giles' pays more in proportion for the support of the poor of his parish than the Duke of AVestminster; the former pays three shillings and sixpence in the pound sterling, the latter scarcely two shUUngs and sixpence. In the provinces there"], [196, "184 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. are a large number of parishes too small to provide for the expenses of a Workhouse, in such a case several parishes unite and form what is called a Union. The Poor-Rate produces every year, for England and AVales alone, about \u00a315,400,000, or about ten shillings and threepence per head of the population. The number of paupers to whom assistance was extended, in 1881, rose to 803,381. London has about 85,000 paupers to relieve every week, of whom 50,000 are in the Workhouses, and the others receive out-door relief. This number does not include the insane, whose maintenance is charged on the parishes, or rather on the counties; nor the vagrants, whose numbers are considerable. That is to what English administrative charity confines itseH. The Government CONSUMPTION HOSPITAL. leaves all the responsibility of it to the parochial authorities, and contents itself by watching \u2014 rather carelessly at times \u2014 the execution of the laws. From time to time the revelations made concerning the treatment to which the unfortunate occupants of the workhouses are subject are enough to make one's hair stand on end. The press gives them publicity, and does its best to remedy the abuses : but when, after an enquiry more or less searching, the Commissioners make their report, the affair has been long forgotten in the midst of daily business pre-occupations. It is evident that the workhouse system is insufficient, particularly in London, where, notwithstanding the innumerable (private) charitable institutions, people actually die of hunger every week. Is it not a disgrace that the richest city in the world should be at the same time the only one whose newspapers periodically contain the appalling heading, \"Death from Starvation\"? If pubhc charity is insufficient, private aid is truly inexhaustible, and does aU it"], [197, "THE WEST-END. 185 can to rescue all the distressed in a country where misery appears blacker and more fearful than elsewhere. , In fact, more than a thousand charitable institutions of all kinds may be reckoned in London, and these distribute, or employ annually in good works, a sum of about \u00a34,000,000. Besides this, for the last twelve years a \" Hospital \" Saturday and Sunday have been instituted, and collections are made in the streets and in the churches. These doles produce about \u00a330,000, which are distributed pro rata amongst the hospitals, according to their expenses. MARYLEBONE HOSPITAL. Hospitals, Refuges, Dispensaries, Asylums, Orphanages, Creches, Night Refuges \u2014 all these institutions are kept up solely by the Hberality of private individuals, by legacies, donations, &c. Not a week passes without the announcement in the news papers of one of these acts of munificence, which are, so to speak, unnoticed, so common are they. Independently of these visible manifestations, private charity finds a thousand ingenious methods of relieving unseen misery, and the number of those who, with the outward semblance of prosperity, are living as the \" pensioners \" of relatives \u2014 and more often of charitable friends \u2014 is very large. The hospitals are numerous and admirably managed. The twelve principal institutions contain in the aggregate 3,700 beds, and assist about 500,000 patients annually. Let us first look at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, which is the oldest in London. Founded by Henry ArIII. in 1547 (but originaUy instituted by Rahere in the beginning of the 12th century), and intended for 100 patients, it has been at successive periods 24"], [198, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 186 enlarged and altered. The present building, situated on the site of the old Priory of St. Bartholomew, dates from-the last century, and contains 676 beds. The Medical Staff is composed of eighty persons; four physicians and four surgeons are on duty day and night in the hospital; they are assisted by 120 nurses. The School of Medicine attached to this hospital enjoys a high reputation. Pitcairn, Abernethy, and Harvey have in turn practised there. St. Bartholomew's Hospital receives every year 5,000 or 6,000 in-patients, and 120,000 out-patients. It enjoys an annual fixed revenue of \u00a340,000. Another very celebrated hospital is Guy's. Founded in 1722 by the bookseller, Thomas Guy, who endowed it with a sum of \u00a3240,000, this hospital enjoys an annual income of \u00a340,000. It contains 1,000 beds, which accommodate 5,000 persons annually ; and the number of out-patients is about 85,000. The School of Medicine is one of the best attended, and numbers 350 students. It wrould be impossible to name all the hospitals here, but we must not pass St. Thomas's Hospital in silence. This institu tion is situated upon the FOUNDLING HOSPITAL. right bank of the Thames immediately opposite the Houses of Parliament. Founded in 1532, and at first situated near London Bridge, it was rebuilt in 1872 on its present site. It consists of eight detached buildings, connected by a double on its present site. It corridor, which overlooks a terrace that serves as an exercise ground for convalescents, and is enclosed by gardens. The detached buildings have four storeys, and are thirty yards apart. This system of isolation gives excellent results, above all as regards the ventilation, which is perfect; but the dampness and fogs of the Thames must be serious drawbacks, and it would not have been difficult, since there was a large sum at the disposal of the Governors (\u00a3500,000), to have selected a better site. The average number of patients is 6,000 annually ; those who seek advice number about 65,000. The fixed income of the hospital is \u00a348,000 a year. Let us not forget the French Hospital, founded in 1867 for the assistance of our fellow-countrymen. The excellent Httle institution renders important services to the unfortunate members of the French colony when struck down by illness. It received, in 1881, 313 in-patients, and 7,600 persons presented themselves for advice. Having no other resources but the liberality of charitable persons, the French Hospital of London has a very limited income. It is much to be wished that the French Government would grant it a higher subsidy than the \u00a348 which the French Embassy bestows on it every"], [199, "THE WEST-END. 187 year. It is an act of charity to call the attention of the French tourists who pass through London to this excellent institution, which owes its existence to the constant and disinterested co-operation of a few charitable men, at the head of whom we may mention Dr. Vintras, who devotes to it both his skill and time indefatigably. Everyone has heard of Bedlam, as the celebrated Bethlehem Hospital devoted to maniacs is popularly designated. Founded in 1746, it has been rebuilt several times. The present building dates from 1812, and cost \u00a3120,000. The 400 mad people whom it contains receive the most intelligent care. CHELSEA HOSPITAL. To brutality and ill-treatment have succeeded kindness, and the greatest liberty con sistent with the necessities of such an establishment. In one of the wards of Bedlam criminal lunatics are confined. Margaret Nicholson, who attempted to assassinate George III., died there in 1828, after an incarceration of forty-two years. We know that individuals who attempt the lives of their sovereigns are generally considered as not in possession of all their faculties, and are confined as lunatics for life. Would not death be preferable ? The Foundling Hospital, intended, as its name implies, for the reception of found lings, has for a hundred years past changed its object. So great were the abuses of its privileges, that the law was obliged to interfere. It now receives the illegitimate children of women who are known. Every w-oman who wishes to place a child there must make application in writing. This somewhat extraordinary regulation does not aUow of the"], [200, "188 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. reception of the children of domestic servants, nor of infants who are more than a year ST. THOMAS'S HOSPITAL old. The child, once admitted, is baptised, and receives a name, which the mother may"], [201, "THE WEST-END. 189 always ignore. Notwithstanding the pitiless severity of these regulations, there are always about 500 children in the Foundling Hospital. Chelsea Hospital is the Hotel des Invalides of London. It is situated on the bank of the Thames, and was built in 1690, in the reign of Charles II. , after the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. The hospital consists of a central building, surmounted by a turret, and two wings, forming three sides of a quadrangle, in the centre of which is an equestrian statue of Charles II. by Grinling Gibbons. Entering by the principal gate under the portico, embellished by four very simple columns, we reach a lobby, wliich leads us to the chapel and dining-hall. The chapel, paved with black and white marble, is furnished with seats. Those in the centre are reserved for the rank and file, the officers' being placed at the sides of the nave. The walls are embellished with flags and trophies. Above the altar is a painting of the \"Ascension,\" by Sebastian Ricci. The refectory is at the opposite side of the lobby, and of the same dimensions as the chapel. It is decorated with several pictures, amongst which is a fine painting by Verrio, finished by Cooke, representing Charles II. on horseback, surrounded by allegorical personages; a large canvas of the battle of Waterloo, and an allegorical picture, by James Ward, commemorate the victories of the Duke of Wellington. The 500 pensioners in the hospital wear uniform, which consists of a long red overcoat, dark trousers, and three-cornered hat. They are divided into six companies, each commanded by an officer. Visitors are admitted to Chelsea Hospital every day between the hours of ten and four. XV. FUNERALS AND CEMETERIES. The English are far from possessing the sense of veneration for the dead in the same degree as the French. For them death is an irresistible occurrence which must come sooner or later, and which should be kept at a distance as long as possible ; but, once the \"grim serjeant\" has done his work, his victim is best quickly forgotten. It is not, properly speaking, indifference, but it is the result of this practical turn of mind which impels English people to look at things upon their best, or least bad, side, and to resume the interrupted current of their business. After having guarded their dead for eight days \u2014 a barbarous and unhealthy custom \u2014they proceed with almost indecent haste to transport them to their long home. A black van, on which the undertaker's men perch themselves : when, having turned the corner of the street and removed the hammer-cloths from the horses, they begin to trot; and some mourning coaches : that is the whole arrangement of an English funeral. In the street not a hat is raised, not a carriage is stopped ; the funeral falls in with the other vehicles. At length the cemetery is reached, where, in a cold and unfurnished chapel, a clergyman\u2014 the dried fruit of the ecclesiastical tree\u2014 gabbles through the"], [202, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 190 service for the \" Burial of the Dead \" in a few minutes. The body is replaced in the van and carried to the deep grave ; there the reverend gentleman murmurs some words, the coffin is lowered, a few handfuls of earth are thrown upon it \u2014 and all is over. There is nothing imposing about this ; it partakes of a poignant and cruel melancholy ; everyone is glad when it is over, including the clergyman, who is expected by other people, whom he will dispatch with the same weary and indifferent air. He is not a minister of religion; he is an employe. An employe, in truth, for the cemeteries are the pro perty of limited companies, which distribute good dividends to the shareholders. Since 1855, this lugubrious industry \u2014 what other term can one use ? \u2014 has developed consider ably. Up to that time the dead were interred sometimes in the church vaults, sometimes in the churchyards. That system, very dangerous from a sanitary point of view, has fortunately come to an end; and there are round London a consider able number of cemeteries, of which the most impor tant are those at Kensal Green and Brompton. Kensal Green Ceme tery, the most renowned of London cemeteries, belongs to a company formed in 1832, and covers about 218 acres of ground. It is estimated that it contains the remains of about 150,000 persons : and under the circumstances, it is not surprising to hear that this \" flourishing con- KENSAL GREEN CEMETERY. cern,\" as it has been described by the officials of the company, yields a very good dividend to the shareholders. It was laid out on a plan similar to that of the celebrated Pere la Chaise Cemetery, in Paris, and is divided into two distinct portions, one of which is destined for members of the Church of England, and the other for Dissenters. Kensal Green Cemetery is the resting-place of a number of celebrities \u2014 artistic, literary, political, and even royal, for the Duke of Sussex and his sister, Princess Sophia (children of George IIL), are buried there. Among the most remarkable personages who are buried in Kensal Green may be mentioned Anne Scott and Sophia Lockhart, daughters of Sir Walter Scott; Sydney"], [203, "THE WEST-END. 191 Smith, Allan Cunningham, Tom Hood, the poet; Thomas Barnes, for many years editor of the Times; Mulready, the painter; Madame Vestris, John Liston, the actor; John Murray, the publisher and friend of Lord Byron; William Makepeace Thackeray,' Shirley Brooks, editor of Punch; John Leech, the celebrated caricaturist; Sir Mark Isambard Brunei, engineer of the Thames Tunnel; Sir Charles Eastlake, P.R.A.; Leigh Hunt, George Robins, the auctioneer; and many others. In Brompton Cemetery are interred amongst other known persons, Sir Roderick Murchison, the geologist, Keeley the actor, and the humorist, Albert Smith. BROMPTON CEMETERY. Another cemetery \u2014 a very important one, which is not situated in London, although it is used exclusively as a place of sepulture for Londonians, is that at Brookwood, near Woking, in Surrey, about 28 miles from the metropolis, on the South Western Railway. It is reached by railway ; and the company despatches special trains, and has made a station purposely for this service. In the foregoing pages we have indicated in broad lines the curious, complex, and ever-changing features of the gigantic town which Herschel considered the centre of the universe. London, which contains more Roman Catholics than Rome itself, more Jews than there are in all Palestine, more Germans, more Italians, and more Frenchmen than are contained in many important German, Italian, and French towns, has preserved, notwithstanding the divers elements which mingle in it, an essentially national character. It is the unique town \u2014 par excellence. It is, certainly, the only one in which a stranger may pass all his life amongst his compatriots, and live his national existence without being obliged to learn the language of the country he is living in. There are Frenchmen"], [204, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 192 who, after having lived thirty years in London, have retired with an honest competence to their native land without having learnt a word of English. So with Italians, Germans, and Belgians. What London will have become in a hundred years, the most audacious cannot hazard an opinion, remembering the prodigious development of the metropolis ; but if the rate of progression, which has been continued for a hundred years, be maintained, we can conceive a human hive of nine millions of people living in 680,000 houses spread over a surface of 200 square miles. Lastly, the improvements, the gigantic works accomplished within the last ten years, and those whicli are in course of execution or projection, tend to make London the most beautiful city in Europe, as it is already the largest and most healthy. Municipal reform, so long waited for, is on the eve of its appearance, and will give a new impulse to the transformation of the metropolis of the United Kingdom, of which the English are so justly proud when they compare their formerly dark and smoky city with the London of the Victorian Era."], [205, "MONKEY ISLAND. CHAPTER THE THIRD -THE OUTSKIRTS OF LONDON. I. THE BANKS OF THE THAMES FROM RICHMOND TO GREAT MARLOW. London, like Paris, is surrounded by charming localities easily accessible, where the smiling verdure, in picturesque and pleasing places, forms a contrast as agreeable as unexpected with the province covered with houses which one has so lately quitted. We can scarcely believe tbat a few miles from Charing Cross the dirty Thames changes into a clear river, lined with elegant houses, with parks fresh and shady, and charming villages where we may breathe the pure and balmy air, and where fogs are unknown. In these localities, at a distance from their business or their desks, live a number of merchants and their clerks \u2014 the former as a matter of choice ; the latter from necessity, for living is cheaper there than in London. Nevertheless, the true country has not yet been reached \u2014 we find it some nine or ten miles from the centre of the City. Although very fond of the country, the London middle-class individual does not rush on Sundays to the railway stations to reach the green fields, as the Parisian does. And what is he do there? Unless he goes to the classic localities \u2014 such as Richmond, for instance \u2014 he finds neither restaurants nor hotels; and even then those 23"], [206, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 194 restaurants are for the most part excessively dear, and quite out of the reach of small purses. The means of transport, too, are re duced on Sundays by one-half. For the lower, middle, and the working classes, the Lord's day is, above all, a day of imposed rest, and pro foundly wearisome. But when the month of August comes, the small tradespeople and clerks go and pass some days on the shores of the Channel \u2014 the Londonian is extremely fond of the sea \u2014 and in two or three weeks lay up a stock of health for the rest of the CORONATION STONE, KINGSTON year. But the richer classes do not behave in the same manner. For many years, excursions into the country THE THAMES AT KEW. have become quite the fashion. Society has broken with the old Sunday traditions, to the great scandal of virtuous people. People of the world have arrived at the con-"], [207, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 195 elusion that a run in a steam-launch on the Thames, a dinner at Richmond, a lawn tennis party in a pretty park, present nothing glaringly immoral ; and iu some houses even TWICKENHAM. quiet little dances are got up. Yes; but what a chorus of reproba- tiou ensued ! For eight days the newspapers were full of letters from good people, who indignantly protested, in the name of morality, against the introduction into a Christian country of Continental customs ; and then \u2014 BRAY the whole thing became part of a recognized order of things, and nothing was effected one way or the other \u2014 as is always the case under such circumstances."], [208, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 196 At present the Sunday boating or carriage excursions are quite a part of Society customs, and the charming banks of the Thames between Richmond and Great Marlow are the favourite localities. This selection is a proof of good taste, for nothing is more picturesquely beautiful than the sinuous course of the Thames between these two points. Going up stream, we first arrive at Twickenham, where, beautifully situated in well wooded parks, we find Orleans House, York House, and Mount Lebanon, occupied by the Princes of Orleans from 1852 to 1871; and Strawberry Hill, tbe celebrated resi dence of Horace Walpole, built on an eminence and surrounded by magnificent gardens. Like Holland House, in London, this historic residence is only a memory, a relic of the past. During the summer of 1883, the furniture and objects of art, with which tbe house was filled, were sold by auction, and the ground parcelled out into building lots, which are being rapidly covered with villas erected by tbe speculative builder. After passing Teddington, the head-quarters of fishermen \u2014 the English are fanatics in fishing \u2014 we reach Kingston, where the Saxon kings were formerly crowned. The stone on wliich the coronations took place is to be seen in the market place. Hampton Court, and the village of Hampton, on the left bank \u2014 Thames Ditton and Moulsey on the right \u2014 present themselves, and, though very pretty, are far from equalling in beauty the picturesque Walton-on-Thames. From Walton Bridge we obtain an admirable view of the river. Turner chose this bridge \u2014 or, rather, the former structure \u2014for one of his most effective pictures. Walton Church, flanked by a picturesque square tower, dates from Saxon times. It contains the remarkable tomb of Lord Shannon, sculptured by Roubiliac. In the mayor's house is preserved the \" Scold's Gag,\" a kind of iron mask, fitted"], [209, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 197 with a piece of wood, which entered the mouth and kept the tongue fixed, for the benefit of too loquacious wives. This ingenious instrument dates from 1632. The beautiful park of Oatlands, which belonged to the Duke of York, has recently been divided into lots, and sold to speculators : as for the house, it has been transformed into a hotel. There is a grotto in the park, the construction of which cost the Duke of Newcastle \u00a340,000. There never has been a more remarkable instance of the useless expenditure of money. From Weybridge to Staines the Thames presents no very interesting features, the THE THAMES AT CLIVEDEN. banks being somewhat flat and monotonous in character : neither Chertsey nor Staines offers any attractions. But as we approach Windsor the scene changes, the river resumes its picturesque appearance. On the right bank the venerable trees of Windsor Home Park form an impenetrable curtain of verdure, through which here and there are gaps, revealing the imposing mass of the Castle, dominated by its enormous Round Tower. As soon as we have passed the Castle we arrive at Eton, the site of the celebrated public school. Almost opposite Eton is Clewer, and Windsor racecourse is a little higher up. On the right bank of the river upwards are several elegant country houses, and in the centre of the stream is Monkey Island, which owes its name to the frescoes which embellish a room in a fishing pavilion, that formerly belonged to the Duke of"], [210, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 198 Marlborough, and is now a hotel. We next reach Bray, a charming little village situated on the right bank. About a mile higher up we find Maidenhead, where the beau tiful viaduct ofthe Great Western Railway surprises us by the bold ness ofthe span of its two spacious arches, and the echoes which they return us. The town has no monuments, and the sole charm of the place consists in the beauty of the surroundings which are revealed at every step, so to speak. A stone bridge unites Maidenhead and Taplow, where is Taplow Court, a beautiful mansion of modern erection, containing a rich gallery of old LIVEDEN HOUSE. paintings, principally of the Italian school. We remark, amongst others, the \"Marriage of St. Catherine,\" by Titian; \" A Holy Family,\" by Jules Romain, and some valuable pictures by G. Poussin, Canaletto, and Turner. A little higher up the river we perceive the princely mansion of Cliveden, belonging to the Duke of Westminster, situated upon an eminence, shrouded by magnificent trees, and surrounded by a park of surpassing beauty, which can be seen when the Duke is absent from the house. This district is dotted with lordly residences, which give us an idea of what the country seats of aristocratic families are \u2014 such as Drop more, the residence of the Hon. G. Fortescue, celebrated for its conifer\u00e6, which can be seen in the park ; and Hedsor Park, the magnificent property belonging to Lord Boston. Cookham is opposite, upon the right bauk. This is one of the best known places on COOKHAM. the Thames, and one of the most frequented. The scenery is beautiful, and sufficiently explains the popularity of the place. Two miles higher up we reach Great Marlow, just beyond which is Bisham Abbey, situated in one of those beautiful parks only found in England. The Abbey, which in the 14th Century"], [211, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 199 belonged to the Templars, was subsequently bestowed upon Ann of Cleves by Henry VIII., after her divorce. The house, of the Tudor style of architecture, is very remarkable, as well as the old Norman church, which is attached to it. It is now in the possession of Mr. Vansittart. The banks of the Thames, unfortunately but too little known to foreigners, offer a series of the most picturesque and delightful scenes which it is possible to imagine. One cannot too strongly insist upon the exquisite charm of these beautiful places, buried in verdure \u2014 of these parks and gardens, kept up with that care and love of nature peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon race. There is a series of surprises \u2014 an unknown England \u2014 which we discover, and whicli is worth a thousand times the crowd of classical and well-known localities which tire one so soon, and which, being always dinned into our BISHAM ABBEY ears, appear inferior to the ideas we have conceived concerning them. On the Thames, on the contrary, the reality surpasses the idea, and no description can do justice to the freshness of the impressions we receive, and the astonishment and pleasure which we experience while proceeding up the Thames from London to Great Marlow, or, better still, to Oxford. Nevertheless, this excursion by water can only be made in fine weather, and only at certain times is there an organized service of boats. But, as the greater number of the places we have mentioned are served by the various suburban railway Hnes which surround London, it is easy to visit the banks of the Thames at any time of year, if one has a few days at one's disposal, and if the weather be favourable."], [212, "200 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. II. GREENWICH AND WOOLWICH. Just as every Englishman believes himself obliged to go and pass a day at Versailles, so every French tourist in England will not fail to visit Greenwich, Windsor, and the Crystal Palace, which it is customary to look upon as parts of London. Therefore, in a volume such as this, it is incumbent upon us to devote a special chapter to them. Greenwich, which is generally visited first of all the places in the environs of GREENWICH HOSPITAL. London, is officially a town by itself, enjoying a municipal and political organization of its own. In reality, it is a portion of London \u2014 that all-devouring town which every year absorbs more suburbs and some thousands of inhabitants, and which will one day include Gravesend in the east, and Windsor in the west. Besides the cab there are three different means of transport available between London and Greenwich \u2014 the railroad from Charing Cross, Cannon Street, and London Bridge; the tramway from Westminster or Blackfriars (Surrey side), or by the steam boats which start from Westminster every half-hour, stopping and taking up passengers at all intermediate piers. The last-named route, though longer than the others, is much the most interesting and picturesque. Leaving Westminster, we have on the left the Thames Embankment, a magnificent promenade planted with trees and extending to Blackfriars Bridge. If the tide is"], [213, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 201 running down, the steamer glides quickly onward, passing in succession Charing Cross Railway Station, the old \" Water Gate \" of York House, in the midst of the gardens which embellish this portion of the embankment ; and the obelisk guarded by two bronze sphinxes. After passing beneath the arches of Waterloo Bridge, which spans the Thames at its widest part within the metropolitan limits, we perceive the beautiful frontage of Somerset House, and subsequently the Temple Gardens. We are now within the confines of the city, as the numerous church spires, above which towers the imposing mass of St. Paul's, plainly indicate. Then we glide under a second edition of Charing Cross THE THAMES AND THE TOWER OF LONDON. Bridge \u2014 this is the Cannon Street Viaduct, beyond which is London Bridge, the last roadway over the river Thames. As soon as we have passed it, the scene changes : to the penny steamers succeed large vessels moored in the stream, between which the small Greenwich boat makes her rapid way. We have scarcely time to cast a rapid glance at Billingsgate fish market, behind which is the spire of the Coal Exchange, ere we find ourselves at the Custom House and the Tower of London, whose massive walls and lofty turrets stand out plainly against the grey sky. The steamer then passes St. Katherine's Docks, which are enclosed by warehouses overtopped by the masts of the ships, and the London Docks, the entrance to which is immediately above the Thames Tunnel. Opposite are the extensive basins of the Commercial Docks. Here the river describes a sharp curve, the tongue of land which it sweeps round is called the Isle of Dogs ; the enormous building facing it is the Foreign Cattle Market. A Httle further on the steamer stops in front of an extensive building with a majestic facade which stands out clear and white from the dark background of thc hill, covered with thick trees, on whose summit is an observatory. This is Greenwich. ?6"], [214, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 202 As we disembark we find ourselves facing Greenwich Hospital, now a Naval College. The word Hospital is not here used in the generally accepted sense of the term, for Greenwich Hospital was the Hotel des Invalides of the Navy, aud not a Hospital for the sick. Since 1871 the Pensioners, instead of being lodged and boarded in the Hospital, have received a pension which amply suffices for their wants. Greenwich Hospital is composed of four blocks of buildings, united by colonnades, and separated from the river by a fine terrace. At one extremity of this terrace, a granite obelisk has GREENWICH \u2014 THE HOSPITAL AND PARK. been erected to the memory of Lieutenant Bellot of the French Navy, who died in one of the expeditions that proceeded in search of Sir John Franklin. Two of the four blocks of buildings project, and in the court which they enclose is a marble statue of George II. in Roman attire. There are in England few monuments of as much worth as Greenwich Hospital, the aspect of which is remarkable. The two buildings, each surmounted by a dome, which rise at the interior angle of the two wings and the colonnade which connects them with the other structures, give to the whole edifice a unity and a harmony which are altogether charming. In the South-West wing is the Painted Hall ; we enter it by the door beneath one of the two cupolas. This hall, which at one time served as a refectory, has now for nearly a century been a gallery of paintings, representing the brilliant engagements of the British Navy, and portraits of"], [215, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 203 its iHustrious officers. The ceiling, painted by Thornhill, depicts the apotheosis of Queen Anne, and the four allegorical figures which surround her represent the four quarters of the World. The panel at the end is composed of a group of portraits, of which the principal figure is that of George I., completed in the reign of that monarch; in the distance is perceived the dome of St. Paul's, and, in the foreground of the picture, the paiuter himself is represented. Thornhill was paid at the rate of \u00a33 the square yard for the ceding, and \u00a31 for the mural paintings. What would our artists of the present THE THAMES AT WOOLWICH. day say if such propositions were made to them ? The most important pictures con tained in the gallery are the \" Death of Captain Cook,\" by Zoffany, the \" Battle of Trafalgar,\" by Turner, and a fine painting by Loutherbourg, representing the Battle of the 1st of June, 1794, in which the Vengeur perished so gloriously. At the end of the hall is a small apartment called the \"Nelson Room,\" in which are religiously preserved the relics of the great English Admiral. The building facing the painted ball is the chapel. It is embellished with carvings, pictures, and ornamentation of great beauty; the ceiling in sunken panels is supported by four beautiful marble columns, and tastefully decorated. Behind the Hospital is the park, which covers a hill on the summit of which is the Greenwich Observatory, whose meridian is the starting point of all the degrees of longi tude in England and her colonies. The measurement from Greenwich to Paris is 2\u00b0, 20', 15\", east longitude. Greenwich, consequent on its proximity to London, and owing to the facilities of"], [216, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 204 communication, is one of the places most frequented by excursionists. There are excellent hotels and restaurants, and every year, until lately, Her Majesty's Ministers used to dine together at Greenwich at the termination of tbe Parliamentary Session : this little festivity was called the \" Ministerial Dinner.\" Woolwich, situated some miles lower down the river, owes its importance to the military establishments which are collected there. At Woolwich is the Artillery and Engineering School, called the Royal Military Academy, which corresponds with the French \" ecoles poly technique et d' application ; \" whence the officers of the Scientific Corps are drawn. The Academy is a building in the Academy is a building in the form of a chateau, which has nothing remarkable about it ; before the entrance is a simple monument, lately raised to the memory of the Prince Imperial, formerly a student there, who was killed in Zululand in 1879. The principal Government Departments are (1) the Dock yard, (2) the Arsenal, and (3) a Military Museum ; to visit these a special permit must be obtained from the War Office. THAMES BOATMAN. Cards arc only issued to foreigners through their respective ambassadors, and then with some little difficulty. The Arsenal is an immense establishment, in which all the works connected with the heavy materiel of War are carried on. The \" peace establishment \" consists of more than 6,000 workmen, but at certain times, as in 1878 and in 1882, when a war with Russia was feared, and during the Egyptian Expedition, the number of hands was doubled. One of the workshops belonging to the Laboratory contains 500 lathes, and 1200 men can work there comfortably. The ArtiUery Barracks, the Common, and the Polygon deserve the notice of visitors, as well as the \" Rotunda,\" a Military Museum, to which the public are admitted between ten o'clock and dusk. III. WINDSOR CASTLE. ETON. The tourist may reach Windsor either by the South Western or the Great Western Railway : the latter is the preferable route, for the station at which we arrive faces the Castle gates."], [217, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 205 AVindsor Castle, admirably situated on a hill of gentle slope, is built in the form of a long square, divided into two almost equal portions by the Round Tower, an enormous keep, thirty yards in diameter, which overtops all the neighbouring buildings. Begun in the reign of William the Conqueror, added to and embellished by all the sovereigns who for eight hundred years have succeeded to the British throne, Windsor Castle sums up and symbolises the history of the English nation. There are, maybe, palaces more sumptuous, of a purer style of architecture, but there are none so majestically imposing. It is, indeed, in its royal magnificence the dwelling which best suits the representatives of the old English monarchy, as solidly established on the British Constitution as the Castle upon its massive stone foundations. It was William the Conqueror who founded Windsor Castle, as weU as the Tower WINDSOR. CASTLE. of London. Induced by the picturesque situation of the place, the name of which is a corruption of the Saxon Windleshora (winding shore), he compelled the Monks of Westminster, who were the owners, to cede it; and, in return, he bestowed upon them some land in Essex. He built some edifices at Windsor, which have now disappeared. Henry I. and Henry III. made considerable additions to these, and Edward III. was born in the Castle in 1312, whence the surname, Edward of Windsor, was bestowed upon him. This prince confided the direction of the works to William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, and it was under the orders of that prelate that the first chapel of St. George was built. Edward III. founded the order of the Garter there, the motto of which, \" Honi soit qui mal y pense,\" is much better known than its origin, for to this day no light has been thrown upon this historical problem. During the reign of Richard II. St. George's Chapel was still being built, and the direction of the work was entrusted to Chaucer, the father of English poetry, who"], [218, "206 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. received two shillings a day for his trouble. But the present chapel, built on the site of the former, was not commenced untU the reign of Edward IV. The architect was Richard Beauchamp, Bishop of Salisbury, who, when he died, was succeeded by Reginald Bray. Elizabeth also added to the Castle, and made the superb terraces, which have such a fine effect. Cromwell, who sometimes lived at Windsor, made no additions thereto; but, under Charles II. , Sir Christopher Wren, who seems to have erected or restored half the monuments of England, carried out some important works at the Castle. Lastly, under George IV., Wyatt, the architect, was commissioned to modernise the Castle, which he did, as well as he could, for a \" consideration \" of THRONE ROOM (WINDSOR CASTLE). \u00a3800,000. As a matter of fact, work is still being done there, notably in St. George's Chapel, the grand steps of which are of very recent date. Queen Victoria is very fond of this residence, where she has passed the happiest years of her life. Few English Sovereigns have spent so much time there as she. In contradistinction to her predecessors, who passed the greater part of the year in London, the Queen only makes her appearance there for short periods and at long intervals. To visit Windsor Castle, we must first procure cards, which are obtainable, gratuitously, in London, or at Collier's library, at Windsor. Nevertheless, the State apartments cannot be seen unless the Queen be absent, and then from eleven to four only. A Thursday or Friday should be selected for the visit, for those are the only days of the week on which St. George's Chapel and the State apartments can all be seen. As in the Tower of London, visitors pass through the apartments in detachments,"], [219, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 207 and under the conduct of a guardian, who affords scarcelv time to examine them, so EAST FRONT AND COURT OF HONOUR (WINDSOR CASTLE). hurried does he appear to finish his task. It is annoying that visitors are not permitted to remain a little longer in each apartment ; for when, after having traversed a dozen"], [220, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 208 rooms, we find ourselves again in one of the courts of the Castle, we have carried away in this rapid course nothing but the vaguest impressions, and a racking headache. The visit commences in what is called the Queen's Audience Chamber, where we remark a beautiful ceiling painted by Verrio, and on the walls three magnificent Gobelins tapestries, representing the story of Esther, as well as some pictures, amongst which is a portrait of Marie Stuart by Clouet, the frame of wliich was carved by Gibbons. We proceed onwards to the Van Dyck Room, so called because of the one and twenty paintings by this artist, which hang upon the walls. This chamber also contains the celebrated portrait of Charles I. on horseback, those of Queen Henrietta-Maria, George WATERLOO CHAMBER (WINDSOR CASTLE). Villiers, Duke of Buckingham and his brother ; of the celebrated Duchess of Richmond ; three children of Charles I., the poets Killigrew and Carew on one canvas, and a portrait of Van Dyck, by himself. Some furniture of 18th century pattern, and some bronzes, modelled by Gouthiere, of rare beauty and inestimable value, are placed in the same apartment. The following, or the \" Zuccarelli Room,\" contains, as its name indicates, a collection of that painter's works. After traversing a vestibule and the grand staircase, where we find a colossal statue of George IV. by Chantrey, we come to the Waterloo Chamber, lighted from above, which has been, not inaptly, compared to the cabin of a ship. It is hung with portraits, of w-hich the least successful is that of the Duke of Wellington. Thence we enter the Presence Chamber, furnished in Louis XIV. style, and hung with lustres, which remind us of those at Versailles ; the waUs are clothed with Gobelins tapestry, representing the history of Jason and Medea. The grand"], [221, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 209 malachite vase, placed at the end of the chamber, was the gift of the Emperor Nicholas to the Queen : it is only remarkable because of its size. Thence we pass into the ROUND TOWER AND ST. GEORGE'S CHAPEL (WINDSOR CASTLE). banqueting hall, St. George's Hall-much too long and too narrow (it is only 30 feet wide, and 180 feet long) ; the walls are panelled with carved oak in Gothic designs, and hung with portraits of the Sovereigns of England, from James I. to George IV. Above these are suspended the banners of the first Knights of the Garter. 27"], [222, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 210 The general appearance of this hall is dull and unpleasant, but it would appear that on gala days, and when lighted up, the effect is splendid ; unfortunately, one cannot have an opportunity of judging more than once in five and twenty or thirty years, as great ceremonials are rare at Windsor. The inspection ends with the Guard Chamber, where we find armour disposed with much taste. By the window are to be seen a bust of Nelson, for which a fragment of the mast of his old ship the Victory serves as a pedestal, four small cannon taken from Tippoo Sahib, and above two busts ofthe celebrated Duke of Marlborough and the Duke of Wellington two small flags, which the descendants of these warriors are obliged to renew ST. GEORGE'S HALL (WINDSOR CASTLE). every year under penalty of forfeiting the domains which were bestowed on them \u2014 on the former after Malplaquet, on the other after Waterloo. Above the chimney piece we perceive the magnificent buckler inlaid with gold, attributed to Benvenuto Cellini, given by Francis I. to Henry VIII. at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Windsor Castle also eushrines some splendid pictures by Rubens, Rembrandt, Lely, Andrea del Sarto, aud various English artists of the 18th and the commencement of the 19th centuries. The private apartments can only be visited by means of an order from tbe Lord Chamberlain, who is very chary of his permission. It is in the gallery forming part of the private apartments, called the Grand Corridor, that the incomparable collection of Sevres china is kept. It is well known to amateurs, and its value is prodigious. There arc also a number of art objects, bronzes, statues, pictures, &c. Thc three private reception rooms are the White, the Green, and the Red Drawing-rooms : the first contains beauti ful furniture of the 18th century, embellished with porcelain plaques, mosaics and"], [223, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 211 bronzes of exquisite finish and taste : the Green Drawing-room contains the famous servicejiH soft paste porcelain of thj royal blue tint made 'I Louis XVI. and after^^H wards purchased I >\\ ( 1 e< I Dra\\y^^^^H UlMI-l apart nu-iil H After visiting I the ter races VIRGINIA WATER (WINDSOR PARK). surround the castle, and ascending the Round"], [224, "212 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. Tower, whence there is a magnificent view, we proceed to St. George's Chapel. This chapel is a masterpiece of pointed architecture ; the interior, particularly, richly embel lished with carvings, pictures, and stained glass, is of great beauty. We perceive the stalls of the Knights of the Garter, above which hang their banners and their coats of INTERIOR OF ST. GEORGE'S CHAPEL (WINDSOR CASTLE). arms, the monument to the memory of the Princess Charlotte, and the gallery in which the Queen attends Divine Service. In the crypt of the chapel is a vault in whicli many other members of tbe Royal Family repose. Windsor Park is divided into two portions ; the Home Park, and the. Great Park, connected by a magnificent avenue 4,800 yards in length, called the Long Walk, at the end of which is a mound surmounted by an equestrian statue of George III. This park, which is not less than 2,000 acres in area, encloses some beautiful spots, and an extensive lake called Virginia Water. It is on this pretty piece of water that in the summer the Prince of Wales delights to assemble his friends to aquatic fetes, after whicli a grand dinner takes place in a cottage situated on the borders of the lake. The Mausoleum, erected by the Queen to the memory of the Prince Consort, is to thc left of the Home Park."], [225, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 213 Eton College is situated some few hundred yards from the Castle, upon the opposite side of the Thames. There is nothing architecturally striking in its appearance ; but it is the principal public school in England, or, at least, the most aristocratic and the FROGMORE (WINDSOR PARK). most expensive. According to the English plan, the pupils are lodged at the homes of their masters, and the school premises are utilised only for lessons. There are about 600 boys at Eton, who are called \" oppidans,\" and they are prepared for the universities. It would appear that a classical education there leaves something to be desired; but, on the other hand, as canoe-ists and cricketers the young Etonians are unrivalled ! IV. HAMPTON COURT, RICHMOND, AND KEW. Hampton Court Palace is forty-five minutes from London by the South-Western Railway ; the station at East Moulsey serving likewise for Hampton Court, which is situated on the opposite bank of the river. The palace, built by Cardinal Wolsey in 1515, and offered by him to his master, Henry VIII. some years afterwards, has undergone many important renovations. The facade looking over the gardens was added by Wren, and of the original palace naught remains but the buildings which surround the first and second courts, and the Great Hall, to wliich an intelligent restoration has given back its pristine beauty. After being used as a residence by many kings of England, and, lastly, by George II. , the Palace of Hampton Court is now only a picture gallery. However, some of the buildings have been converted into apartments in wliich are lodged, gratuitously, as"], [226, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 214 an acknowledgment of past services, retired officers, impecunious functionaries, and widows of those who have served the State. The visitor enters Hampton Court Palace by the West Gate, where is a cavalry barrack. At tbe end of the avenue is the palace. A large archway admits us into the first court; at the left angle a flight of steps ascends to the Great Hall. This is a magnificent nave of Gothic style, whose grand proportions and rich decorations constitute it a veritable marvel. The roof, finely carved, and on which the arms of Henry VIII. are displayed, is sixty feet high. It is supported by elegant arched buttresses similar to those in Westminster Hall. The Great Hall is lighted by lofty RICHMOND BRIDGE. stained glass windows of a very remarkable character. Six of these represent the arms and genealogies of the six wives of Henry VIII. The better to judge of the effect of this magnificent hall, the visitor should stand below the project- ing window, the glass of which represents the arms of Henry, and those of Wolsey, and Jane Seymour. The tapestries wliich cover the walls represent thc History of Abraham. They are arranged in order, commencing at the left, as we enter. We reach the picture galleries and the apartments by a fine staircase adorned with allegorical paintings by Verrio ; and then we find ourselves at the beginning of a series of rooms (there are more than twenty of them), in which arc placed many hundreds of pictures, the majority of which have a true artistic value. A somewhat strange regulation decrees that the visitor having once been admitted cannot return ; he must proceed to the end : so it is with real pleasure that we find ourselves in the admirably kept gardens which extend to the east of the palace. Amongst the curiosities of the gardens at Hampton are the Maze and the Vine. The latter springs from a single cutting planted in 1768, on which, in some seasons, nearly 2,500 bunches of excellent"], [227, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 215 grapes have been counted, which are reserved exclusively for the Royal table The HAJIITON COURT. Lion Gate, near the Maze, leads us to Bushey Park, wherein the avenue of horse chestnut trees is considered one of the most beautiful in the world. A herd of fallow"], [228, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 216 deer roam at liberty in the park, thus adding to it that country aspect which the English excel in giving to all their gardens, and in which their principal charm consists. Hampton Court Palace and Gardens are open all the year round, except on Fridays and Christmas Day, from 10 a.m. until dusk; on Saturdays from 2 o'clock only. Richmond, a pretty little town situated on the banks of the Thames, half an hour by railway from London, is one of the favourite haunts of all classes of Londoners, who delight in breathing the fresh air and in picnicing in the park, or in dining sumptuously at the \" Star and Garter,\" which is as renowned as the \" Pavilion Henry IV. \" at St. Germain. Richmond has its terrace, too, at tbe foot of which winds the Thames, and from wliich a beautiful view is obtainable \u2014 a prospect which Sir Walter Scott considered unique. Richmond Park is about seven miles in circumference; it is a beautiful promenade; but the right of way, as in Hyde Park, is rigorously denied to cabs. Kew, like Richmond, is much frequented by the inhabitants of the metropolis. The great attraction of the place is the Botanic Garden, which is open daily to the public \u2014 even on Sunday, after mid-day. The great palm-house and the Museum are most interesting. Adjoining the Botanic Garden is a picturesque park, called \" pleasure grounds,\" where are the nurseries, a pretty lake, and numerous buildings, the utility of whicli is doubtful ; amongst others, there is a pagoda built after the designs of Sir WUHam Temple, and a temple of Victory. There is also at Kew an Observatory, built"], [229, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 217 for George IIL, and now belonging to the British Association \u2014 a society incorporated to encourage the study of science. The public are not admitted there. Kew Gardens are the property of the Crown, as Kew Palace is, which has not been occupied for years. In these gardens are the celebrated horse - chestnut trees, which Londoners like to see in bloom every year, and which English horticulturists declare are the finest in the world. This superlative, \"the KEW GARDENS. 28"], [230, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 218 finest in the world,\" is very much used in England, where it is employed on every occasion. VIEW FROM THE TERRACE AT RICHMOND. V. THE CRYSTAL PALACE. DULWICH COLLEGE. THE ALEXANDRA PALACE. The Crystal Palace is situated at Sydenham, and can be reached by the London, Chatham, and Dover (High Level) or the London and South Coast Railways, the stations being at tbe very doors of the Palace. Erected in 1853, on thc model of the"], [231, "THE CRYSTAL PALACE"], [232, "220 LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. Exhibition of 1851, the Crystal Palace is a building of iron and glass, 1,446 feet long, 100 feet high, and 280 feet wide. It is flanked by two towers, from the summit of wliich there is a magnificent view. The visitor is impressed, as he enters the palace, by the vast proportions of the nave, cut by two transepts, one in the centre, the other THE ALEXANDRA PALACE. at the southern extremity. Beneath the former of these we find the grand orchestra, the concert hall, and the theatre. The great nave is ornamented with plants, shrubs, and flowers, tastefully arranged. In the portion on one side of the great transept, lateral courts are arranged as nearly as possible like ancient buildings. Thus we have the Egyptian Court, which is' guarded by two lions crouching at the entrance, and filled with monuments and statues, exactly copied from those in Egypt. A colonnade, which divides two of the rooms, is a perfect representa tion of that of Karnak. The Greek Court, beside it, presents a strong contrast, in its elegance and graceful ornamentation, to the stiffness of the Esrvptian monuments. Here we find temples, O*/ J. *- statues, sculptures, bas-reliefs, and a reproduction one-fourth of the actual size of the western fayade of the Parthenon. The Roman Court comes next. The centre of this hall is occupied by models of the principal monuments of Rome. There is at one side the Forum as it now is, and on the other side the Colosseum, and the Pantheon restored. But as soon as we have crossed the threshold of the Alhambra Court, gorgeous with gilding and arabesques, and the bright hues peculiar to Moorish art, the transition is so sudden that we pause confounded. But soon the eye, captivated by the elegant motives"], [233, "THE OUTSKIRTS. 221 of the decoration, the harmony of the shades, the complication of designs, more apparent than real, experiences an infinite charm in admiring this vision of Spain and the East, so skilfully invoked by the exact reproduction of the Court of Lions at Grenada. One never tires of examining these columns in all tlieir detail, these vaults, and, above all, the admirable decorations of the hall of the Abencerage, the dome of which is a marvel of good taste, richness, and colour. After that the Byzantine and Renaissance Courts, and even the Pompeian House, seem cold and dull. On the other side of the transept the galleries are used for permanent displays of goods\u2014 a bazaar, indeed \u2014 where one may DULWICH COLLEGE. 'VAv.\\J\\J.- procure numerous articles at high prices, which can be obtained more cheaply elsewhere. Cutlery, Birmingham articles, photographic ap paratus, pianos, carriages ; in fact, something of everything. A thorough examination of the Crystal Palace is somewhat costly, for, by a very unbusiness-like arrangement, the visitor is obliged to pay anew to enter any of the exhibitions ; when what could be more simple than to raise the price of admission, and permit the public to go where it pleased ? The park, which covers an area of nearly 300 acres, is perhaps the most interesting portion of the palace. We reach it by two terraces, of wliich the lower is 1,500 feet long and 450 feet wide, forming a splendid promenade. The Crystal Palace is one of the sights which a stranger must not omit to see, and the English say that whoever has not seen the Crystal Palace has seen nothing. This is, perhaps, going rather too far; nevertheless, this gigantic bazaar is very interesting to visit once, if it is only for the satisfaction of saying you have been there. The whole place, palace and gardens, cost \u00a31,480,000, and one asks one's self whether this enormous sum could not have been employed to greater advantage."], [234, "LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 222 Not far from the Crystal Palace is the little village of Dulwich, justly celebrated for its picture gallery, which is not so well known as it deserves to be. It is placed in an unpretentious building, erected by Sir John Soane, whicli contains five well-lighted galleries, in which arc exhibited 400 pictures, some of great value. The history of this collection is somewhat curious. It was formed in the last century by Noel Desenfans, for King Stanislas of Poland, who destined it for the Museum at Warsaw ; but this unfortunate monarch, having been dethroned before he had sent over the pictures, they were left with Desenfans, who bequeathed them to his friend, Sir Francis Bourgeois, a Swiss, and a member of the Royal Academy. He, in his turn, willed all the collection to Dulwich College, with a sum of .\u00a310,000 to provide a gallery for them. This fine collection includes a number of masterpieces. Dulwich College, founded by Edward Alleyne, an actor contemporary with Shakespeare, is situated some distance from the Picture Gallery, in the new buildings, erected in 1870. The Alexandra Palace, on the model of thc Crystal Palace, is built on the centre of a fine park upon Muswcll HiU, at the north side of London, on the Great Northern Railway. The career of the Alexandra Palace has been as short as it has been lustreless. Opened in May, 1873, it was destroyed by fire a fortnight afterwards. It was rebuilt; and two years later the inauguration took place in the presence of the Lord Mayor and the Corporation. The want of a second Crystal Palace was not felt, and the Alexandra Palace has been a gigantic fiasco, from all points of view. This is much to be regretted, for that part of the county of Middlesex in which it stands is very picturesque, and, being near London, ought to attract the public, which, on the contrary^, shows itself very indifferent to thc attractions of the Alexandra Palace, which several managers have taken in hand, aud where they have ruined themselves, without making it popular."], [235, ""], [236, ""], [237, ""], [238, ""]]
