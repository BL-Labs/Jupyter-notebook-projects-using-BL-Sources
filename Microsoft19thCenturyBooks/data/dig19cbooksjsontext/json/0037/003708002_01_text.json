Unmindful he what path to choose, Had gain'd the pleasant banks of Ouse; And now the nearest upland 'won, He saw the towers of Huntingdon.0 Matilda's towers frown'd on the scene, Proud, as once rose the Empress Queen ! And fancy pointed out the spot King Stephen gave the royal Scot.7 Where now those lofty towers that frown'd Majestic on the groves around?

Forward he sprung, with eager bound, The wished-for path was easy found : Near it his willing footsteps sped, Just as the owner left the shed : Unconscious of a stranger near, His early matins caroll'd clear.

The castle of Fitzhugh, romantically and beautifully situ ated on the banks of the Tees, belonged to the lords of that name, who flourished in the fifteenth century : of its ruins scarce a vestige remains. The neighbouring monastery of Athelston still bears the arms of Fitzhugh ; a certain proof"], [189, "NOTES 177 they had been benefactors to it. The tomb of the family still exists in Ronaldkirk. The Tees rises at the head of the river Wear, in the Moors, which spread through the site where Cumberland, Westmor land, and Durham, mix their boundaries, and flow through the romantic valley of Teesdale ; serving, throughout its whole course, as the limit between Yorkshire and Durham. \u2014 Above Barnard castle it becomes wild and rapid, making way through falls and cataracts; one of these, some miles beyond Middleton, called High-Force, or Force-Fall, is considerable enough to assume the character of sublimity. It affords many striking scenes in its progress, and at length forms an estuary at its mouth below Stockton. CANTO III. Note 1. Page 61. Lines 3, 4.

It was a place of some consequence in the early ages of the British church ; a synod having been held there in 792, and another in 800. This being a solitary spot, proper for religious contempla tion, a certain holy man, named Godric, afterwards canon ized, who had in his youth visited the holy sepulchre, retired hither, and lived sixty-six years the life of a hermit, in an hermitage dedicated to St. John the Baptist. It was during his life-time made a cell to the monastery of Durham. Upon his death, in 1170, some monks from Durham retired to it, and Bishop Pudsey made them an allowance for their sup port. This bishop's son considerably increased their revenues ; and thereupon a Benedictine priory, subordinate to the mo nastery of Durham, was settled here in 1196. Although it was thus deemed a cell to Durham, its income was valued distinctly from it, being estimated, in the 26th of Henry VIII. at 1222. 15s. 3d. per annum by Dugdale, and at 1462. 19s. 2a!. by Speed. It then consisted of a prior and eight monks, although Leland says thirteen ; and, soon after the dissolu tion, it was granted to the see of Durham. , When the church and other edifices at Finchale were erected, it is not possible to determine with precision, no evidence thereof being found in the archives of the dean and chapter. The solemn remains of this church and priory are situated in a very deep vale on the banks of the river, where the stream, making a sweep, forms a little level plot, which is almost covered with the buildings; sheltered to the"], [191, "NOTES 179 north by the lofty rocks and hanging woods of Cocken, and on every side by steep hills. The river flows swiftly over a rocky channel ; and the murmuring of the water-falls re echoes from the groves and cliffs. The other buildings are disunited. Part of the ruins are converted into a farm-house It is said that St. Godric and Bishop Pudsey are both in terred here ; but the floor of the church is covered with ruins, and overgrown with weeds and brambles; so as to prevent, without much labour, a search for their tombs. Beneath a window in one part of the priory is shown a seat, which, according to some legendary accounts, had the virtue of removing sterility. Tradition says that this seat, called the wishing chair, was formerly of great repute; and, although of stone, appeared much worn by suitors for pregnancy. Note 3. Page 76. Line 13.
