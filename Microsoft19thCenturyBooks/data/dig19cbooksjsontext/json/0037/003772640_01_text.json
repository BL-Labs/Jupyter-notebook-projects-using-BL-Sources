It is bounded N. by the river Co leroon, B. by the sea, W. by the district of Trichi nopoly and the protected State of Pudukkdttei, and S. by Palk's Bay, the Rainnath Zamindari and the Pudukkdttei territory. The district has thus two sea-boards, the one extending 72 miles north to south from Divikdttci to Point Calimere, and the other (divided in fact into two by the bend it makes at (1) See rage 116."], [36, "2 Acquisition of the provinces. Ativira Ramanpattanam) 68 miles from Point Cali mere to Arasanagari ; the length of the entire coast line being thus 140 miles. The extreme breadth of the district from its western boundary, about 10 miles from the town of Trichinopoly, to Negapatam on the coast is 69 miles. 2. In 1749, the English Presidency of Fort St. David took the fort of Divikdttei, situated at the mouth of the Coleroon ; when Pratap Sing, the Mah ratta Eaja of Tanjore, concluded a treaty with them, surrendering the fort with a small territory adjoin ing it, consisting of 31 villages yielding a revenue of 9000 Pagodas (Rs. 31,500). Daring the subsequent wars of the Karnatak, the Raja maintained the re lation of an ally to the English and the Navab, Ma homed Ali, and in the latter end of the century, the Tanjore principality became a protected State of the British power, paying its share of the subsidy for the army, which the latter maintained for the defence of the country, together with the tribute, which the Na vab had assigned to the British. In 1778, Raja Tulzaji, son of Pratap Sing, ceded, in consideration of services rendered to him by the British and in hope of their future protection, the sea-port town of Nagur with a tract of country adjoining it, known as the Nagur settlement, which, with the adjoining sea-port town of Negapatam, in later times yielded a revenue of about four lakhs of Rupees. In 1781, Negapatam was taken from the Dutch by a detachment of the British army under the com mand of Sir Hector Munro, aided by the fleet under Sir Edward Hughes. And in 1799, the rest of the Tanjore territory was ceded to tho Honorable the East India Company by Raja Sarabhoji, adopted"], [37, "3 son of Tulzaji, under treaty dated 25th October of that year. Subsequently in 1803, the small district of Kilanilei, situated at the south-western end of the Tanjore territory, of which the annual value at the time was about Rs. 30,000, was transferred to Eaja Tondaman of Pudukkottei, in pursuance of a grant said to have been made but revoked by Eaja Pratap Sing during the middle of the last century. In 1845 the small settlement of the Danes at Tranque bar of the annual value of about Rs. 21,000 was acquired by purchase along with the other posses sions of that nation in India. The present Tanjore Collectorate thus comprises the territory ceded to the East India Company by treaty at the close of the last century, with the separate settlements of (1) Divikdttei, (2) Nagur including Negapatam, and (3) Tranquebar, and less the Kilanilei district. The only part of the territories comprised within the limits of the ancient Hindu principality of Tanjore, now not in the possession of the British, is the small settlement of the French at Kareikkal.1 \u2014 (See Political History, Part II.) 3. The district naturally divides itself into two Natural division of parts, the northern comprising the delta of tbe the Deltaic and Cauvery and the southern the tracts beyond its \u00a3*\u00b0n~s.etaiC P\u00b0rr influence. 4. The Cauvery which rises in the Coorg moun- Delta of the Cauvery tains, bifurcates about nine miles west of Trichino- tem.1 1 This together with Pondicherry wa3 in the occupation of the English for many years previous to 1816 in which year, it was restored to th9 French under the treaty of Paris (1814). Its revenue in the year preced ing its restoration was Ks. 57,257."], [38, "4 General aspect of the Delta. poly, into two branches, of which the northern takes the name of Coleroon ; while the southern retains that of the Cauvery. About 17 miles below the point of their bifurcation, and seven miles east of Trichi nopoly, the two branches very nearly re-unite, form ing between them an island, known as the island of Srirungam. Below the point where they thus meet, the Coleroon takes a north-easterly course, skirting the district of Tanjore along its entire length on the north and enters the sea at Divikottei with its volume of water comparatively little diminished ; while the branch which retains the name of Cauvery enters this district and splitting up into numerous branches, covers its northern portion with a vast net-work of irrigation channels. Thus, the delta of the Cauvery, which, at the western boundary of Tanjore, is hardly two miles in breadth, gradually widens by the spreading up of its distributories on the south and the slanting course the Coleroon takes on the north, and in its more eastern portion, for about thirty miles, covers the entire width of the district from the Coleroon to the Palk's Strait, excepting only a small tract of country about the promontory of Point Calimere. Of the numerous offshoots of the Cauvery, some find their way into the sea, carrying off its surplus water surcharged by the drainage of the wet cultivation which they receive in their lower course . while the rest are lost in the wide expanse of rice fields. The one which retains the name of Cauvery throughout, reduced to an insignificant channel, debouches into the sea at Cauverypatam about 8 miles north of Tranquebar. 5. The delta is a large alluvial plain sloping gently to the sea, and devoid of all natural emi nences, save the ridges and hillocks of blown sand, which fringe the narrow strip of beach along the"], [39, "5 coast. \" The sea rolls upon a shelving sandy shore unbroken by rocks of any kind; hence the coast is remarkably monotonous in aspect.\"1 The whole surface of the delta is one even level of paddy fields interspersed only with tops or clumps of cocoanut, mango and other fruit trees. There are no forests or tall tree jungles. 6. The non-deltaic or upland portion of Tanjore Non.deitaic portion. 11 \"\" Its physical features. comprises its southern and south-western parts. South and south-west of Tanjore, the country rises above the surrounding level and forms a small pla teau, known as the Vallam table-land, broken by small ridges of grits and sandstones. With this exception, the whole of the non-deltaic portion of Tanjore, more elevated of course than the deltaic, is likewise an open flat sloping towards the east and equally destitute of hills and forests. 7. The exact relative proportions of the deltaic and non-deltaic portions of the district have not been ascertained, and, owing to the irregular termination of wet cultivation on the south side, cannot be ascer tained with accuracy. From Revenue Statistics, the entire area of the district (3654 sq. miles) may be taken roughly to be about equally divided between the two portions, the deltaic slightly predominating. 8. The surplus waters of the Cauvery enter the Navigable Rivers. sea by several mouths, all of which are more or less affected by the tide. Those named below are navi gable, for small boats drawing two feet of water, throughout the year, within short distances varying within a maximum of ten miles. Name. Place of disemboguement. 1.

Most of the other larger branches of the Cauvery are navigable inland during the floods, which con tinue more or less for a period of seven months from June to December ; but such traffic as used to pass through some of them from Trichinopoly to Combaco num and other river side towns in Tanjore has been completely drawn off by the Railway, and little or no inland traffic by rivers now exists. Even near the mouths of the rivers, the traffic by water is not so considerable as might be expected from the amount of export trade carried on at the sea-port towns of Tanjore _ the Railway and the ordinary roads, of which latter the district generally possesses a great abundance, being chiefly resorted to for the trans port of the surplus produce of the district to the coast. The traffic, which passes down the rivers near their mouths, consists chiefly of rice and paddy, and the only rivers which are used to any considerable extent for this purpose are the K6reiya.ru, the Adap paru and the Tirumullavasel ITppanaru ; the parti cular parts of the district whose produce is conveyed to the coast by these rivers not being connected therewith by easier means of communication. There is no import traffic up from the mouths of the rivers."], [41, "7 9. There are but two canals or artificial water Canals and Artificial _, . ' ' water courses used courses in lanjore. Une of these was constructed for navigation. in 1854 and 1855 along the coast from Tranquebar to Tandavankulam near Tirumullavasel on the north, a distance of 19 miles. It was designed chiefly to provide employment to the laboring classes during the high prices, which prevailed in 1854, in conse quence of the failure of the north-east monsoon in the preceding year, preceded by the violent hurri cane of March 1853. (See Chapter III). It has, however, been greatly silted up and is now all but abandoned. Even if it could be kept clear of silt, the canal is not likely to be much used . as there is very little traffic in agricultural produce between any two towns on the coast, and there is hardly any pro duce along its line for this canal to carry. The other is the Vedarannyam canal constructed in 1869. Inclusive of its subsequent extension into the salt swamp south of Vedarannyam, (see para 11. of this Chapter) its total length from that point to Negapa tam is 35|- miles, made up of 13^ miles of the exist ing channels of three rivers, Adapparu, Vellaru, and Kaduveiyaru, 10^ miles of drainage streams inter cepted in their passage down to the sea and 12 miles of new cuts connecting these together. The cost of the canal in the aggregate amounts to about Rs. 1,34,000. It was designed and is used chiefly for the transport, of salt on Government account from Vedarannyam to the central depot at Negapatam, and owing to the absence of a good road, (the one along the coast being, except for the first six miles from Negapatam, exceedingly sandy) is also resorted to for general traffic, of which, however, there is not much, as the whole country south of Negapatam is a comparative desert. 10. In the Colleroon, besides several small ones, islands"], [42, "8 Salt Marshes. there is an Island called \" Naduttittuvinayakam,\" which is an inhabited village. Its area is 537 acres. It contains 126 houses and a population of 696 inhabitants. It is here that the two branches, into which the Coleroon divides itself, are spanned each by a weir for irrigation, called the Lower Anikat, with a bridge over each for traffic. This island is 13 miles north-east of Combaconum, and 28 miles in a direct line from the sea. 11. Salt marshes or lagoons are to be found along the coast on both sea boards ; but the only one which requires special notice is the large swamp known as the Vedarannyam1 Salt swamp, which is utilized for the production of salt. It runs along the coast from near Point Calimere westward and covers a tract about 30 miles long by 4 or 5 miles wide. It is filled by two periodical high tides or floods, called Chittra parvam and Visakha vellam, occurring on or about the full moon in May and June respectively, and retains the sea water to a depth of about 2 feet over a considerable area enclosed by low earthen banks with sluices, Avhich, when the beds are filled, are closed to prevent the water flowing back into the sea. As the enclosed water evaporates, pure white salt in large translucent blocks is formed. If only the season continues favourable, that is, the crop of salt as it is formed, or the brine itself before it begins to form, is not destroyed by heavy or repeated falls of rain, the outturn of the yield is abundant, and, it may be generally said, limited only by the amount of labor that is available for collecting it. But the i Vedarannyam (the forest of the Vedas) is the name of a small town containing a temple of some celebrity, about 10 miles from Point Calimere. Both the places are held sacred in connection with the legend, that Eama first attempted to build a causeway to Ceylon from this point. The name \" forest of the V<5das\" is derived from the adjoining jungle, with which is associated the sanctity of the whole neighbourhood."], [43, "9 Sea Ports. crop is from the nature of the case to some extent precarious, and owing to this source of supply being in a remote corner and inaccessible to the general trader, the subject of utilizing and throwing it into the market, as well as guarding it from theft and smuggling, has always been a problem difficult of solution in the administration of the salt revenue of the district. 12, Along the line of coast, there are no less i than sixteen ports1 for the shipment and landing of goods, and the most important of them are Nega patam with the adjoining port of Nagtir on the eastern and Muttuppettei on the southern sea-board. Nega patam has always been the principal sea-port town of the district, carrying on a considerable amount of export trade in rice with Ceylon and an import trade in timber, betel-nuts and spices with the Straits Settlements . and now, as the terminus of the South Indian Railway and the station of the chief Government salt depot, it has risen considera bly in importance. Muttuppettei, a small but busy town, about 6^ miles inland, communicates with the sea by the river Kdreiyaru, a branch of the Cauvery. Possessing the advantage of a protected Bay, where the native craft could moor during bad weather, this town, with the adjoining sea-port of Ati vira Ramanpattanam (Adrampatam), carries on an active trade with Ceylon all the year round. 1 1.

The geological conformation of the delta of the Cauvery is necessarily very simple. Fluviatile alluvium, presenting variations in its composition in different parts, constitutes its entire structure. In the more western portion of the delta, the alluvium partakes more of rich loam (sometimes in the form of fine reddish silt and sometimes of blackish clay, but oftener of pale clayey mud), which gradually dimin ishes, until it is lost in the blown sands of the coast. 2. The most common sorts of soil in the delta, according to native classification, are : \u2014 (1.) Sevval (Q&6disii<sq) or reddish loam. \u2014 This is met with almost throughout the delta ; but occurs generally only at places nearest to the heads of irri gation channels, where the rich pulverulent silt is deposited. Its chief constituent is ferruginous red sand. It is plastic when wet, but friable when dry. The soil is considered to be the best for rice crops. (2.) Vandal (en ssstl^ so) or Silt. \u2014 This is a more pulverulent form of No. 1, (Sevval), and is found chiefly on the margins of river channels in the shape of recent deposits after the subsidence of high floods. This soil produces the richest garden crops. (3.) Kali (\u00absrfi) or clay. \u2014 This is in fact a more highly plastic and tenacious form of Sevval, rarely met with. It is used chiefly for pottery. (4.) Earisal (\u00e6\u00c6^w) or dark humus. \u2014 This very much resembles the black cotton soil and is soft and plastic when wet. It is met with less often than No. 1, but is more common in the more western portion of the delta. It ranks next to No. 1 in pro ductive power."], [45, "11 (5.) Manal (^ewrero) or sandy soil. \u2014 This consists chiefly of pure river or shore sand with a compara tively insignificant proportion of argillaceous matter, often impregnated with salt or kankar (lime). This is the general formation of theA soil on the coast ; sandy soil occurs also inland in particular spots, apparently old beds of rivers, which have shifted their channels. This description of soil is generally barren ; when cultivated it requires a considerable amount of manure to make it productive. (6.) TJppalar (s-uuen *\u00bb) or soil impregnated with salt; also called Kalar (\u00abot-/t). \u2014 This soil is a mix ture of clay and sand largely impregnated with salt. It is generally met with in hollows or swamps on the coast and occurs also in particular localities inland. It is absolutely unproductive, except when large volumes of fresh water are available, in which case, the salts are washed away by repeated flooding. (7.) Sukkdn (*\u00ab\u00e6ts3t) or hanhar soil. \u2014 This is largely impregnated with carbonate of lime and ex hibits a whitish calcareous incrustation on its surface. It is often met with inland more especially along the south bank of the Coleroon. This description of soil is exceedingly barren and unproductive. On the whole, the soil of the more eastern portion of the delta is decidedly inferior. In the Memoirs of the Geological Survey, Messrs. William King and E. Bruce Foote observe (vol. 4, part ii, page 7) : \u2014 \" The sandy character of the superficial beds of the alluvium of the deltas of the Cauvery and Punniar. especially at their seaward extremities, is a remark able feature, and shows that but for the supply of water furnished by the rivers themselves to the cul tivators, the delta lands would ere long lapse into the condition of barren and desert-like sandy plains.\""], [46, "12 Geology of the up- land portion of the District. 3. The upland portion of the district, excepting the country lying adjacent to the sea, is occupied by rocks classed by Geologists as sedimentary. The boundaries of sedimentary rocks and fluviatile allu vium meet at the western end of the district not far from the south bank of the Cauvery ; the latter widen ing as we pass towards the east ; while the former narrows gradually until near Pamani a village about 20 miles south-east from Tanjore, it wholly disappears beneath the alluvium of the delta.1 Below this point, as already stated, the fluviatile alluvium spreads over almost the whole breadth of the district from the Coleroon to Palk's Strait. Southward in a straight line from about Tanjore, the laterite rocks extend into the Tondaman country and below this line they spread some distance eastward and meet marine deposits as they approach the sea. As already stated, the relative areas of the delta and the up land tracts have not been exactly ascertained. 4. The prevailing soil of the entire tract occupied by sedimentary rocks is laterite. In the country lying immediately south-west of Tanjore, and more especially in the Vallam neighbourhood, it is highly conglomeratic and thickly covered with quartz pebbles and sandstones. In parts west of Vallam, beds of yellow ochre spreading over small areas are met with. Kankar or lime in the shape of nodular concretions is more generally met with in the upland parts of the district. Deposits of soda occur on the Trichinopoly boundary south of the Cauvery. 5. The table-land of Vallam presents phenomena of considerable interest to the Geologist. Here he meets with strata of mottled grits, with boulders of whitish-chert imbedded in them ; he meets also with l Ibid part II, p. 168."], [47, "13 pebbles of different varieties of quartz and not un frequently rock crystal, smoky quartz, cairngorms and amethysts. 6.

F. Blanford and Part II by Messrs. W. King and B. B. Foote. The notice of the Direc tor General of the Geological Survey, Thomas Old ham, ll.d., which prefaces Part II of the report is dated April 1864, and I have not been able to find, that the survey has been extended since that date south of the line above indicated. The information contained in the report in regard to the portion of Tanjore, which came under examination, though of very considerable value, so far as it goes, is not complete or exhaustive ; it is scattered over the entire length of the report in fragmentary detail in con nection with similar geological features of the other parts of the area surveyed. The annexed extracts, arranged under their proper heads, contain all the information touching the geological conformation of Tanjore, which is obtainable from them. ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS. (1). \" Deposition of alluvium has taken place along the whole sea-board of this part of Southern India, forming a continuous belt varying in breadth, which, in a westerly direction, runs up the valleys"], [48, "14 of the three1 main rivers, and of their tributaries ; while all along tbe edge of the sea-ward belt, and occasionally further inland, ridges of sand have been formed by the winds prevalent in these localities. The alluvium of the Cauvery extends over a very wide area, occupying a considerable part of the Tri chinopoly district, and by far the larger half of Tan jore, and it strikes up in a northerly direction to join the alluvium of the Vellaur in the South Arcot district.\"\u2014 (Part II, p. 25). (2). \" I have stated above that the fluviatile allu vium consists principally of a pale sandy loam, called by the natives masab. Some other forms of deposit are, however, met with in the broad expanse of the Cauvery delta and elsewhere. Thus to the east of Sheally a dark sandy loam is the prevalent soil.\" \u2014(Parti, p. 182.) (3.) \" Two principal varieties of soil occupy by far the greater part of the surface of the delta, and are very nearly equal in extent of development; 1st, dark humus ; 2nd, pale yellow sandy soil.\" \" The dark humus occurs chiefly above and about the head of the delta ; the sea-board and adjacent country having a decidedly sandy character ; many parts indeed, if not irrigated, would specially become a perfect desert. The humus is, where dry, not un like cotton soil in appearance, but less friable; when wet, it has considerable plasticity, without, however, (in general) assuming a clayey character. The sandy districts, when well irrigated, are by no means unfertile, though vegetation has not quite the same unbounded luxuriance as on the dark soil. i The Ponniyar or southern Pennar, the Vellar and the Cauvery."], [49, "15 Clayey beds are very rare, the best marked is a hard ferruginous bed of clay exposed by the surf on the north side of the mouth of the Cauvery at Cauvery patam. This bed is only exposed to a limited extent.\" \u2014 (Part II, page 27.) SANDY SOILS. (4.) \" Under this head I include the ferruginous sand which covers the Cuddalore sandstones1 in Tanjore, Trichinopoly, and South Arcot, and the sandy soil (also generally ferruginous) which in general thinly covers the granitic ridge to the north of the Cauvery, forms a narrow band round the foot of the hills, and is also spread widely over the gneiss of the western part of South Arcot. In the sea-board of the Cauvery delta at Tirmel vassel and to the North of Tranquebar some ridges of ferruginous sand, much resembling the above in mineral character, and probably formed by similar agency, have been mapped by Messrs. King and Foote.\" \" The mineral character of these sandy soils does not vary to any great extent, except in the propor tion of iron which they contain, and to which their red colour is due. They consist chiefly of sand with a certain proportion of argillaceous matter. The proportion of iron varies from a mere trace, in the case of the grey sand which frequently occurs at the bottom of the deposit, when the latter is of any thickness, to 20 or 25 per cent, in the case of the lateritic forms of the soil such as occur around Am bapuram on the Cuddalore sandstones to the north of the Murdayaur. The ordinary form of the soil, a 1 For a description of these, see note to extract (8.)"], [50, "16 red sand, contains, according to two analyses of Mr. Tween, about 2 per cent, of iron, the two speci- mens being respectively as follows : \u2014 No. 1, from Munnagoody, in the Wodiarpolliam talook, Trichinopoly district 2-1 per cent. No. 2, from Punrutti, on the bank of the Gud dalum River, in South Arcot 1*46 per cent. which are equal to 4 per cent, and 2-7 per cent, of hydrated peroxide, the state in which the iron exists in the soils. \" Varieties intermediate between this and laterite are very common. These contain small pisiform ferruginous concretions disseminated through the sand, which in an unweathered section of the soil are seen to blend off into the matrix in such a man ner that there can be no doubt they have been form ed in situ, but when washed out and exposed to the action of the air and rain, assume the shining dark brown surface characteristic of weathered laterite. This form of the soil is very common on the Cudda- lore beds in the North-East of Trichinopoly.\" \" Another form in which the pisiform concretions are so abundant, that when the loose sandy matrix is washed away, they become cemented together as a friable laterite, occurs to the West and North of Vallam in Tanjore, also near Ambapuram (above mentioned), and sometimes on the gneiss as near Madripet to the north of Oolunderpet, in South Arcot. The section at this last place is as follows : \u2014 Ferruginous sand 3 feet. Concretionary lateritic gravel 2 feet. In this bed the iron was very unequally distribut ed, some parts being much more closely concretion- ary than others.\"\u2014 (Part I, pages 184, 185, and 186.)"], [51, "17 (5.) \"It now remains to show that the chemical composition of sandy soils is such as we may reason ably expect them to have been formed from the shore sand.\" \" The following is an analysis by Mr. Tween of a specimen of red soil from Puttoocautaincoodicaud, a few miles south of Wodiarpolliam.

Had the sand been taken from 2 or 3 feet below the surface, it would probably have contained a larger percentage of alu mina judging from the muddiness of water penetrat ing at that depth when a hole is made in the Sand.\" \" In the above analysis the percentage of iron is larger in the sand than in the soil, but this varies 3"], [52, "18 considerably in other specimens of both, as will be seen from the following estimations by Mr. Tween : \u2014 Iron.

The sand in this zone is under conditions similar to those of metallic ore on a frame or percus sion buddle, being on an incline (usually steep in the case of the Madras Coast) and submitted to peren nial washing by the waves. But during the low elevation of the country each and every part of the ridges now occupied by red soil must have been in its time subject to the above conditions immediately previous to its final conversion into dry land, and I would thus explain the prevalence over the country generally of soils or superficial deposits (including* laterite*) rich in iron, richer as a rule than thick sedimentary formations originally derived from the same source, viz., the metamorphic rocks.\" \u2014 (Part I, pages 196, 197, 198, and 199.)

The greatest elevation is attained by an isolated sand hill, on which is built the Coopum, or fishing village of Negapatam. The sand-hill in this case is fully 50 feet above the surrounding beach, and commands a fine view over the level country all round.\" \" No general indications of a tendency to advance inland were observed. This comparatively station ary condition of the blown sand-hills appears to be caused by the pretty equal effect of the monsoons ; for, though the north-east monsoon blows on this coast with much greater force than the south-west,"], [55, "21 its transporting powers are negatived by the heavy rains, which, by saturation for a considerable time effectually bind the loose particles of sand. From Tirmelwassel southwards, it was frequently observed that a dense jungle of screw-palm or Pandanus inter vened between the sand ridges and cultivated ground offering a perfect barrier to the advance of the sand. In the screw-palm jungle, small but beautiful glades covered with short fine turf occur not un frequently. South of Negapatam, there are some very fine sand-hills, having a steep slope facing the sea. On ascending these, the landward side was found to be quite steep and backed up by a thick jungle of trees and Palmyra palm. Further south the ridges are lower, and the tree jungle ceases, so that the sand extends further inland, until stopped by the Pandanus jungle. That there is, however, some advance, is shown by the rapid silting up of a canal running northward from Tirmelwassel parallel to the beach-line.\"\u2014 (Part II, pages 27, 28 and 29.)

(9.) \" In the neighbourhood of Tanjore are some coarse grits and conglomerates, which I have refer red to this group, although, as stated in a previous chapter, I cannot consider their age as indisputably settled. They are exposed to a considerable extent in the neighbourhood of Vellum, and the moat of the old fort exhibits a fine section of them to a depth of about 20 feet. They consist of false bedded sandstones and grits, mottled with irregular ferruginous infiltrations, and in some places passing into laterite to a depth of 6 or 8 feet from the surface. Where laterite is formed the rock appear ed to be more argillaceous than elsewhere. Bands of conglomerate are also intercalated, chiefly con taining quartz-pebbles of various tints, (cairngorm, amethyst, and rock crystal*), and at one spot several great blocks of cretaceous chert, similar to those in the sandstones near Thaloor (page 142), and containing a few fossils. Messrs. King and Foote, who first noticed these, obtained from them some specimens of Cidaris spines (impressions), and a cast of a terebratula and some other small fossils (all of which were subsequently lost in the ship which was conveying them to Calcutta). These the South Arcot and Trichinopoly districts. * * * * As indicated by the name \" Cuddalore Sandstones, \" this series of rocks consists mainly of more or less ferruginous sandstones associated with mottled grits, contain ing numerous cavities filled with clay and occasionally beds of clay. Resting upon these, occurs very generally a highly ferruginous conglo meratic deposit of indurated clay, well known as laterite. This laterite is in many places apparently inseparable from the soft mottled grits, and seems to pass downward into them by imperceptible gradations.\" * \" These are collected by tho natives, and several lapidaries in the vil lage of Vellum find employment in cutting and polishing them for sale.\""], [57, "23 blocks of chert are, I think, imbedded in the con glomerate, and have not been formed in situ, inasmuch as although of large size, (measuring 3 or 4 feet in diameter), they contain no pebbles, and their sandy base appears to be of finer grain than that of the conglomerate bed in which they are enclosed.\" \" Two miles south of Vellum a bed of laterite, which is exposed at the surface, (and probably belongs to the Cuddalore beds), is largely worked for building purposes by the natives. It is, when freshly cut, a porous, ferruginous, sandy clay, which hardens on exposure to the weather, and only after some months becomes brown and glazed on the surface, in the manner characteristic of laterite.\" \" The group does not probably extend much to the West of Vellum, where it forms a little escarpment such as usually bounds the formation. But as nothing is seen of any rock for some miles to the westward, owing to the thickness of the soils which cover the face of the country, its exact limit in that direction cannot be ascertained. To the eastward it extends as far as near Pamani and then disap pears beneath the alluvium of the Cauvery delta, which also bounds it on the north ; but to the south it appears to extend into Tondiman's country, and how much further is not ascertained. The only other good section exposed to the south of the Cauvery, besides that of Vellum, is in the moat of Tanjore, the fort of which stands just on the northern edge of the formation, overlooking the delta of the Coleroon and Cauvery.\" \u2014 (Part I, pages 167 and 168.) On the subject of the non-extension of the group to the west of Vellum, Messrs. King and Foote in their report say (Part II, page 42) : \u2014"], [58, "24 (10.) \" Mr. H. F. Blanford has assumed that no grits extend to the westward of Vellum ; it is true that none are exposed on the high ground west of the great Vellum nullah, but the whole of the ground there is so thickly covered with dark-red soil and black laterite, that the nature of the under lying rock cannot (or could not at the time of our visit) be determined. But the lower beds of the grits are unquestionably exposed in the nullah close to the village of Vanarapata, and as the eastward dip of the whole formation is very slight, there seems every reason to believe that it extends west ward across the horse-shoe-shaped valley of the Vellum nullah, and thins out on the gentle slope of the gneiss between Vellum and Singiputty. If the grits do not die away on the gentle slope of the gneiss, they must abut suddenly against a head-land of it, and it seems very unlikely that this could be entirely hidden by the talus of red soil and laterite.\" \" Further, the general outline of the rising ground on the west side of the nullah does not indicate any change of rock to have taken place.\" \" The sudden termination of the grits at Vellum would only make the overlap of the laterite much greater than we are inclined to regard it.\" \" The accompanying Section, Fig. 1, will help to explain the true nature of the overlap.\" Speaking of grits (they divide the Cuddalore sandstone series into two groups, \u2014 laterite deposits and the grits) ; Messrs. King and Foote note :\u2014 (11.) \" Again, at Tanjore, above the fort and in the ditch of the little fort or citadel, there is a fine display of mottled grits, which are covered up by pale drab or reddish sands passing to the south-east and east, and the grits are but very rarely seen.\""], [59, "25 \"On the top of the rising ground immediately east of Vellum stand the remains of an old square fort, surrounded, except at the north-west corner,1 by a deep moat dug out of the mottled grits. Close to the north-east corner of the moat, and exposed by the denuding action of a spring emerging from the grits, are some boulders of whitish chert imbedded in the grits. These boulders have a very close resem blance externally to the extremely hard limestone occurring at Naicolum, near Cotatoor.\" \" They contain some fossils, such as a species of lithophagus, cast of a terebratula, a coral, and im pressions of clavate (club-shaped) spines of a variety of cidaris, which, however, have not yet been com pared, consequently the age of the beds whence these boulders are derived is uncertain, but they are most likely of cretaceous age.\" \" Several more blocks of this cherty rock are to be seen at the foot of the causeway crossing the moat, and fragments are strewed about inside the fort, by which attention was first drawn to the matter.\" \" The mottled grits occasionally contain numerous pebbles of different varieties of quartz ; and rock crystal, smoky quartz, cairngorms, and amethysts are not unfrequently found in the various nullahs running off the grits plateau near Vellum.\" \u2014 (Part II, p. 36).

Most interesting examples, on a small scale, of this last feature, are observable to the south of the Trichinopoly Race-course.\" \" The probable unconformity of the laterite to the mottled grits of Tanjore and Vellum is assumed for the following reason : that the laterite greatly over laps the grits stretching for many miles westward over the gneiss rocks in the direction of Trichinopoly. Of the existence of the overlap, there can be no doubt whatever, as the contact of the laterite and gneiss is exposed to view in many places.\" \u2014 (Part II, pages 41, 42).

This white soda-soil lies on the gneiss, which, however, is only occasionally exposed, as, by the side of the road a few hundred yards west of Buttalur (Buddelur) Trig, station, to which place the boundary of the Cuddalore sands trends generally north-east from the spot where it crosses the Trichinopoly road. This white soil is not only very barren, producing little more than low prickly gum-tree (Babul) jungles, but, owing to the large quantity of soda and potash it contains, is very unstable, causing very serious trouble in maintaining the earthworks in connexion with the high road and the Great Southern India Railway (between Trichi nopoly and Negapatam).\" \u2014 (Part II, pages 42, 43)."], [62, "28 Economic Geology.

I have also noticed it at several places between Tanjore and Trichinopoly, and at Andanapet to the east of Verdachellum, and it pro bably covers a great part of the Cuddalore sandstones concealed beneath the red soil. At Vellum it is cut with a chisel-pointed crowbar into blocks 2 feet 6 inches long, 1 foot wide, and 6 inches thick. It is, when first extracted, a flaky ferruginous sandy clay, and rather friable, but when exposed for some months to the action of the sun and rain, as is usually the case before it is used for building, it hardens and becomes covered with a dark polished encrusta tion of hydrated oxide of iron, which protects it from further change, and resists the decay of the stone, however long it may be exposed. At Vellum it is much used by the natives, in building their houses, in preference to brick, and the Vellaur anicut at Chetiatope, near Bhonagiri, is built in part of this rock quarried at Strimustrum.\" \u2014 (Part I, p. 206.)

The former occurs abundantly over a great part of the area described, both on the crystal line and sedimentary rocks, and to some extent in the fluviatile alluvium of Tanjore and South Arcot. The latter is used on the Coast, and at those spots at which shells are found in sufficient abundance in a fossil state, chiefly at Kunymalur, a few miles to the west of Porto Novo.\" \" The intermittent process of burning is the only one practised, and the quantity of lime burnt at one operation is usually small, frequently less than a hundredweight.

Most of the religious edifices and tanks constructed of this stone show the lines and angles of the carvings as sharply as though fresh from the builder's hands.

The large quantities of sediment carried down in their waters during freshes are swept away by the strong current which sets up the Coast, and the long even line of sandy coast which stretches along the sea-board of the Peninsula, is unbroken by the encroachment of any modern deposit on the surf-bounded waters of the Bay. The alluvial deposits of a by-gone epoch ex tending inland to the westward, are now upraised from 20 to 30 feet above the reach of the highest floods, and the great rivers flow for several miles"], [66, "32 through plains of an old alluvium now in course of destruction; and in obedience to the same law of gravitation which determined its formation, being denuded by the streams that partly formed it, and carried down to be deposited anew in the great re servoirs of the ocean. Along the Coast this forma tion continues without a break from Pondicherry to Point Calimere, beyond the southern limits of our map, and stretches inland in three principal divisions, corresponding to the principal rivers of our area. * * * * The third division of the alluvial deposit forms the delta of the Cauvery, included in the fertile province of Tanjore and terminating to the south in Point Calimere. The greater part of this delta, like the alluvial plains of the Vellaur and Puniar, is now at a higher level than that of the highest floods. The surface is sometimes undulating and at one spot on the coast, the alluvium forms a little bank a few feet high, now gradually yielding to the denuding action of the waves. The recent alluvium, that below the present flood-level of the rivers, forms a narrow strip along the course of the main streams, and can scarcely be defined with ac curacy, owing to the great works of irrigation which have now converted a large part of the older allu vial tract into a wide spreading paddy swamp.\" \u2014(Part I, pages 19, 20 and 21.) v24.) \" Land-slips and the shifting of river chan nels are the most important changes, in a geological point of view, which are observed in inland provinces.

Ample evidence of this may be seen at Tranquebar, which town seems to have suffered more than any other along the Coast from marine inroads.* But for the stone groynes or break-waters thrown out by order of Government, the citadel and town would, in a few stormy seasons, be washed down by the rains.\" \" The encroaching action of the sea has been going on at intervals for a longer period than can be traced in history. In 1755 the Danish Authorities applied to the ' Tangaur' Rajah for an extension of territory, a very large portion of the fort having been washed away by the sea. (See \" An account of the war in India from 1750 to 1761,\" by Richard Owen, Cam bridge, London, 1762, page 131.) By referring to the very interesting \" Reports of the Madras Engi neers\" above quoted, it will be found that during the north-east monsoon of 1849, the coast suffered at Cauverypatam ; also at Negapatam, where part of the Coopum or fishing village was washed away ; and at Tranquebar, where the sea encroached two yards on the land.\" \" Again at Tranquebar, in 1853, during a hurricane, two houses were destroyed, and the custom house on the beach outside the citadel injured by the violence of the waves, and further, between the month of June and the end of that year, one of the groynes and part of the fishing village. It is also mentioned in the Reports, on the authority of Colonel Getting, Danish Engineer Officer, and fifty-six years resident \u2022 \" For full information about these, see various papers by different Engineers in the Report of the Madras Engineers for 1856.\" 5"], [68, "Si in Tranquebar, that one or two hundred years back, the beach extended 400 or 500 feet beyond the present line of sea-walls, and that at a still later period, a battery stood 300 feet further out than the existing walls.\" \" Fronting the sea between the King's and Queen's bastians, stands a good-sized pagoda, which has suffered much from the heavy surf during storms.

IV.) shows its condition in August 1859, the east front of the Goparum or gate tower having fallen down.\" \" This rapid y\\ earing of the beach at Tranquebar is attributed to the fact that the sands rest on a bed of clay, and to the more directly vertical action of the waves here than elsewhere ; also to the particular set. of the currents ; confirmatory of which is the fact that the mouth of the river Nundalaur, south of this place, as well as the rivers entering the sea at Nega patam and Tirmellvassel, are shifting in a northerly direction. This action would also account for the northerly inclination of the lowest reach of the Cole roon river, tbe sand carried out being constantly spread north by the up-coast current.\" \" These currents, full particulars of which we have not been able to obtain, are in a great measure de pendent, for direction and intensity, on the prevalent monsoon ; but the southerly current which comes in from the Indian Ocean through Palk's straits seems to be the more powerful, if we may judge by the direction pointing to the north, in which the spits of sand at the mouths of the Nundalaur and Coleroon lie.\"\u2014 (Part II, pages 140, 141 and 142.)"], [69, "35 7. From What has been stated under the head Mineralogy. of Geology, it will be seen that the district con tains no rocks of the gneiss or metamorphic series nor any metallic ores. A few iron ores are occa sionally met with in the Vellum neighbourhood ; but they would hardly repay the cost of collec tion. Tanjore is, however, not deficient in ordin ary building materials. Laterite, as has been seen, is abundant in the south-western portion of the dis trict ; while there is hardly any part of the delta where clay of fair quality for making bricks, tiles and pottery is not at hand. Indeed the more gene ral use of bricks and tiles for house-building is the characteristic feature of Tanjore ; in the delta, none but huts of the very poorest classes are built of mud-walls or roofed with thatch, and those who can not afford burnt bricks use them raw. Kunkur or lime is met with almost everywhere beyond the delta, and is abundant in the Vellum neighbourhood. It is found also in parts of the delta, more especially in the bed and along the bank of the Coleroon. Sea shells for stucc\u0153 are easily procurable on the coast. Yellow ochre is quarried in considerable quantities west of Vellum. Chalk and soda are met with in small strata in several parts beyond the delta. CHAPTER III. Climate, Meteorologt, Direction of Winds, Rainfall, Floods and Droughts, Storms and Hurricanes, and prevailing Diseases. The climate of Tanjore generally varies very little Climate, from that of the other districts on the plains of Southern India. The hottest months of the year are April, May and June ; and in June, when the hot land winds, with dust storms, most prevail, and the rivers have not yet received their full flood, the"], [70, "36 temperature rises to its highest and the heat is most intense. After this, the freshes in the rivers and the occasional showers of the south-west monsoon tend to keep the atmosphere in some measure cool ; but the strong westerly winds, which begin in May, continue through July and part of August, with in termissions during which there is either a complete lull or a gentle current of southerly breeze. In the latter part of August, close suitry weather, relieved by short intervals of cool breeze from the south or west, follows, and continues till the setting in of the north east monsoon in October or November. The tem perature then falls perceptibly and is low during the continuance of this monsoon, i. e., till about the end of January. In February and the early part of March, the weather is moderately warm during the day and cold at nights with heavy dew both at nights and in the mornings ; it is generally enjoyable. In the latter part of March, the hot season sets in. 2. On the whole, with the sea on two sides, an abundant supply of fresh water obtainable through the Cauvery channels during more than half the year, and a free drainage, which the surface of the country sloping towards the sea affords ; the district possesses more than an average share of the conditions essen tial to health and possible in such a climate. In the Medical Topography of the Madras Presidency, compiled from the records of the late Medical Board in 1838 ; the sanitary condition of this district is described thus : \u2014 \" The climate is very healthy and entirely free from miasmatic exhalations, the tem perature being much the same as in other parts of the Karnatak, till the month of June, when the rivers are filled, and the heat thereby becomes moderated. * * * * she inhabitants are very healthy and enjoy a great immunity from visceral diseases of all"], [71, "37 kinds, and until the commencement of the monsoons, the coast is well adapted as a place of resort for convalescents, on account of its equable and moderate temperature together with the refreshing coolness of the sea-breeze. Point Calimere is much famed for the salubrity and coolness of its climate during the hot months, being situated on the coast about 28 miles south of Negapatam, at a point where it bends and takes a due westerly direction for upwards of 30 miles beforeit again runs south. The coast at PointCalimere forms a considerable promontory, having the sea on both sides, when the south-west is no longer a land wind as in other parts of the coast ; but becomes a pleasant sea-breeze ; the place is therefore an agree able retreat during the hot months in the interior.\" 3. Point Calimere has always been the sani tarium for Europeans during the hot season. En closed by the sea on the east and south, by a large swamp filled with sea water on the west and by a belt of jungle on the north ; it is completely protect ed from the scorching land winds of the south-west monsoon. This locality is perhaps the coolest on the east coast of the Bay of Bengal. 4. The range of thermometer is registered at Range of Thermo only two stations in the district, viz., Negapatam me er' and Combaconum ; at Negapatam by the Civil Surgeon and at Combaconum by the Apothecary in medical charge of the station. At Negapatam, the mean temperature for 1877 was 92\u00b0, ranging from 101 \"5 in August to 82*4 in January (both averages, the daily maximum and minimum not being recorded) and at Combaconum, it was 84\u00b0 ranging from a maxi mum of 94\u00b0 in July to a minimum of 78*8\u00b0 in Janu ary. The average monthly range of thermometer at both stations for each year from 1870 to 1877 is given in the annexed table, and it is worthy of note,"], [72, "88 that at Combaconum, which is more than thirty miles distant from the sea, tbe temperature is generally lower (notably during the period of the south-west monsoon) than at Negapatam on the coast, the result apparently of the entire neighbourhood of Combaco num being covered with fresh water channels and rice fields, besides being thickly wooded with trees.

The rainfall, as everywhere else, varies con siderably from year to year, and is unequally distri buted within the district, being generally heavier on the coast than in the interior. The south-west monsoon sets in in May or June and continues more or less till September ; but the rain falls at only long intervals and but rarely for two hours continuously ; the aggregate fall during this monsoon for the last ten years averages 15\"78 inches. During the first three months of this period, i. e., from about the middle of May to about the middle of August, strong land winds from the south-west prevail. The north east monsoon sets in in October or November and continues more or less till about the end of January, but the rains now seldom extend beyond December. During this monsoon, the rains are more continuous and on the whole more copious ; the aggregate for the last ten years averaging 25*02 inches ; but in point of fact, Tanjore is benefited more by the S. W. than by the N. E. monsoon ; for though tbe local rainfall of the monsoon first mentioned is less, the freshes in the Cauvery on which the wet cultivation in Tanjore mainly depends, are due chiefly to the greater abundance of it on the western ghauts. The total average for both the monsoons is 40-8 inches. In the year 1877-78, in which the rainfall was over the average, the total number of rainy clays at Nega patam on the coast was 76, and the total rainfall at the same station, 5T9 inches, giving an average of 6"], [76, "42 \u202268 inch per day ; 49 out of the total 76 rainy days and 37\"8 out ofthe 5T9 inches of aggregate rainfall were in October, November and December. During the north-east monsoon, the direction of the wind is almost invariably from north-east, and the strong cold winds succeed generally the heaviest rainfall of the season. The winds of the south-west monsoon are much stronger, and those of the north-east mon soon lighter than in the districts towards the north.

There is no instance on record of any destruc tive floods, which extended any distance inland, by the rising of the sea, and the only one of river floods which caused any general or considerable damage occurred during a violent hurricane at the end of March 1853 ; a full account of this visitation will be found under its proper head. The violence of this hurricane was felt more severely inland than on the coast. 10. As the south-west monsoon, which sends down its main supply of water to Tanjore through the Cauvery, is never known to have totally or to any material extent failed . so this district is never known to have been afflicted with drought. From failure of local rains, coupled occasionally with a deficiency or unseasonableness of river freshes, there have been years of deficient harvest and high prices; the latter, however, oftener resulting from the pre valence of scarcity in the neighbouring districts than in Tanjore itself ; but so far as recorded statistics or traditions go, Tanjore has never experienced an absolute scarcity of food as the result of drought. 11. There is but one instance on record of Tan jore having been afflicted with famine, and that was in the two memorable years of Hyder's invasion, viz., 1781 and 1782.\u2014 (See Political History, Chapter VII). 12. The statistics of produce and price are avail able with more or less completeness from the year 1776, and it is interesting to note how far Tanjore was affected in those years in which famine or scarcity prevailed in other parts of the Presidency.

It appears, however, from the report last mentioned, that, occurring as it did at a period of the year, when the produce of the season then past had been secured or disposed of and little or no crop remained on the ground, it caused no considerable damage. The hurricane of March 1853 was the most violent, from which the interior of Tanjore is known to have ever suffered ; but it was not so much the winds that blew but the floods which they brought down from the westward that caused the damage which ensued.

Fortunately, there was little or no loss of life ; but the destruction of property was very considerable. A large quantity of grain which was then lying on threshing floors (the staple crop of paddy had been just then reaped) was partly washed away and partly dam aged by being steeped in water ; an immense number of cattle and sheep were destroyed ; most of the laborers' huts and other thatched buildings were blown down ; the destruction of trees, chiefly cocoanut, was immense ; not a cocoanut or plantain fruit was to be seen for months after this hurricane, and no mangoes were heard of until the mango sea son of the following year. Of course, the embank ments of rivers and chnnnels, as also roads, sustained extensive damage. The damage in the aggregate was the heaviest in the southern and south-eastern parts of the delta comprising the taluks of Mannar gudi and Tiruttireipundi ; in the more western and northern portions, it was comparatively light, and the hurricane hardly extended to the Pattukottei taluk beyond the delta. The aggregate loss to the Mirassidars or ryots under the various heads in that year, including what they had sustained from unfavorable season previous to the hurricane, was estimated by the Collector at Rs. 17,33,060, as shown below, and on his recommendation sup ported by the Board of Revenue, the Government sanctioned a remission of Rs. 2,64,612 from the year's demand."], [83, "49 Particulars of Loss. 1.

At Tranquebar, two houses were destroyed and the Custom-house injured by the rising of the sea. i The estimate in the case of the first item necessarily rested on the re presentations of the ryots, and was, therefore, not regarded as reliable.

The hurricane of April 1859 was less violent inland than on the coast. The floods it brought down were not so heavy as those of March 1853, and moreover at this time, comparatively very little grain had been left on the threshing floors ; so that the damage inland was confined mainly to the breach ing of the river banks and the falling down of trees and dilapidated buildings. The disasters at sea during this hurricane were very heavy and lament able. It prevailed in the latitude of Negapatam ; but its force diminished as it passed inland. The rainfall was not very heavy ; at Tranquebar on the three days the hurricane lasted, viz., 23rd, 24th, and 25th, April 1859, it amounted to a little over 18 inches. The loss of life and property at sea, as enumerated in the reports of the Collector, Mr. W. M. Cadell, dated 26th and 29th April 1859, were as follows : \u2014 1. British Barque \"Monarch,\" which had sailed from Negapatam the day previous to the bursting of the storm, with 200 coolies on board, came in contact with the British Ship \" Ballyneich, \" bound from Calcutta to Glasgow, and both were so disabled, that they came ashore about 8 miles south of Negapatam. The crews of both the vessels were for the most part saved, but one died subsequently by the falling down of the building where he was lodging at Negapatam. The coolies were nearly all drowned. 2. An Arracan ship was stranded and a dhony wrecked at Tirumullavasel. 3. Two native brigs came ashore at Caverypatam and two more at Kareikkal. 4. Thirty to thirty-five vessels, chiefly square rigged, were wrecked between Tranquebar and Point Calimere. Crews believed to have nearly all been saved."], [85, "51 16. The hurricane of November 1871 commenced Hurricane of Novr. at about 6 p.m. on 6th and lasted till about 10 a.m. on the 7th ; but apparently it was towards the inter vening morning that it was most furious. On this occasion likewise, the cyclone was more violent on and near the coast than in the interior, and its main centre was near Tranquebar ; in the taluks which lie southward inland it was comparatively little felt. At Mayaveram and Shiyali, it blew first from north and then veered to the south ; elsewhere it was observed to blow from south-west to north-west. At Kodianpalayam and Tirumullavasel near the northern extremity of the district, the sea, raised by the strong northerly wind, broke in on the shore and carried away a large number of houses, causing the death of thirteen persons by drowning ; at Tiru mullavasel, a boy was killed in addition by the fall of a cocoanut-tree. In the Nannilam taluq, part of which adjoins the coast line between Tranquebar and Negapatam, fourteen lives were lost by the falling of houses and trees. At Negapatam two persons were killed by the falling of a tiled house ; the total loss of life having been thus thirty. At Negapatam, four native craft, which were at anchor at the burst ing of the storm, went or were blown out to sea ; of these only one returned and nothing had been heard until the date of the Collector's final report dated the 22nd idem of the other three. Two boats loaded with Government salt sunk in the Vedarannyam canal a few miles south of Negapatam. At Tran quebar, of the 36 boats which lay beached at the Port, 28 were broken to pieces and carried out to sea, and the rest considerably damaged. In this neighbourhood, the damage to house property and to trees and plantations was very extensive. All public offices in the town were much damaged,"], [86, "52 Cyclone of April 1872. Prevailing diseases. and the flag-staff on the citadel was blown down. At Negapatam, the roof of the Railway station was blown off and the rest of the Railway buildings suffered more or less. At \"Vedarannyam, the salt in store as well as the salt works suffered very heavy damage. The destruction of plantain and betel vine gardens was general throughout the delta, and a large number of trees were also blown down. The rainfall during this cyclone was not very heavy ; it ranged from 4-9 inches at Shiyali to 10*6 at Comba conum.1 17. The cyclone which visited the Coromandel Coast on 30th April and 1st May 1872 requires to be noticed only on account of the lamentable havoc it committed at Madras and elsewhere. Tanjore experienced only the outside of it. At Negapatam, 20 native craft put to sea in order to take shelter in the Bay, and one of these was cast ashore at Point Calimere. At Nagiir, two men were drowned in attempting to get on board their ship. With these exceptions and with the exception also of the damage done to salt works and the salt manufacturing operations, which was rather extensive, Tanjore sustained very little injury from this cyclone. The rainfall at this time ranged from about 6 inches at Pattukottei to 14| inches at Shiyali.2u 18. The most common of acute diseases are fevers, small-pox and cholera (all more or less epi demic) and also diarrh\u0153a, bowel complaints, dysen tery and sore eyes. The chronic complaints more generally prevalent are dyspepsia, rheumatism in milder forms, and venereal diseases.

It will be seen, that the number of deaths from this disease varies considerably from year to year ; but considering that on an average it is just five per cent, on the aggregate amount of mortality, it may be fairly presumed, that the great bulk of the population is secured by the operation of vaccin ation against the attacks of this disease. The people of Tanjore generally are not deterred by any prejudices from availing themselves of vaccination. 21.

It was particularly destructive in 1854,1 1866, 1869 and 1875. This disease commences generally in December or January, when the chill north-easterly winds prevail, and the free consump tion of new corn, peas and roots, which as a rule, are gathered at this period of the year, brings on indigestion, which often terminates into diarrh\u0153a or cholera. The disease, when it breaks out in an epidemic form, continues more or less through the following hot season, lt will be seen from the table given above, that in four out of the past eleven years, (1868-69, 1871-72, 1872-73, and 1873-74), there was little or no cholera ; the very small num ber of deaths entered under this head being due obviously to bowel complaints or diarrh\u0153a, which are ordinarily confounded with cholera. Indeed, it is to be doubted whether the figures given for other years do not include a considerable number of deaths from the more common diseases. 22. Diarrh\u0153a, and bowel complaint, except when they develop into cholera, are generally easily cured by ordinary native medicines and more especially by omum-water,2 which is generally used with marked benefit in such cases. Dysentery is also cured by native medicines. Sore-eyes cause nothing more than temporary pain and discomfort. Dyspepsia is the characteristic ailment of the upper classes and is the result chiefly of sedentary habits and continu ed neglect of health. It is but seldom eradicated ; but rarely develops into diseases of a fatal character. The same may be said of the forms in which rheuma tic and venereal diseases are ordinarily met with in Tanjore, except that they are more amenable to medical treatment. i The statistics of this year are not available. 2 Sison or Bishop's weed."], [89, "55 23. The only diseases prevalent in this district Endemic diseases. which can be regarded as endemic, are elephantiasis and ruptures.

Those most common are the two called in Tamil Komari and Vekkei ; tbe former affecting the hoofs and the latter the bowels, and each exhibiting itself in a variety of type. These diseases prevail chiefly during the hot season and are produced generally by the severity of the weather and the deficiency of fodder. CHAPTER IV. Flora. The District of Tanjore presents all those varieties of flora, which might be expected from the great variation of soil and humidity within its limits. Common fruit trees, such as mango, jack, tamarind, iluppei (Bassia longifolia) and cocoanut are abund ant. The almost innumerable district and village roads are fringed with avenues of inferior trees such as banian, ichchi (Fiscus Tsiela), Puvarasu (Thes pesia populneus), nim or margosa, Odiyan (Odina \u2022wodier) and Naval (Syzygrium Jambolanum), and in some parts also with tamarind, mango, cocoanut and other fruit trees. Owing, however, to the entire absence of woods or forests, the district is deficient in the supply of timber of a superior quality for house building, as well as of firewood; and for these, it is"], [90, "56 dependent to a great extent on imports from other countries. Jackwood, as also the wood of Puvarsu trees, when procurable straight and of sufficient size, furnishes fine and strong wood for furniture ; but the available supply of both is much too limited. Bambus, which grow in abundance in the delta ; the palmyra trees which abound along the southern sea-board and the inferior wood of the indigenous trees generally go a great way to supply material for the houses of the poorer classes. 2. Of medicinal plants and herbs the district possesses all the varieties common in the peninsula ; the more valuable of these are found in the upland tracts south and south-west of Tanjore. 3. The following list shows the names of the principal indigenous timber trees and medicinal and other useful plants, with a brief description of each.

The species is propagated from young shoots. Its stem and leaves are not used here for making paper.

This plant produces the dye-root known in official correspondence as chay-root. The bark of the root, in which resides the coloring matter, yields the fine durable red colour of Madura cloths. In Tan- jore it is cultivated to a small extent in light, dry sandy soils near the coast, and also grows sponta- neously in similar situations in the Tiruttureipundi and Pattukottei taluks. The right of digging out the wild roots is farmed out, and yields a small revenue. This is the well-known country Sarsaparilla, and occupies an important place in the pharmacop\u0153ia of native doctors. It is considered to possess high healing virtues, and is very generally administered as an alterative and purifier of blood in cases of dropsy, dysuria and venereal affections. This plant is cultivated partly for the sake of the strong fibre its stem yields, and partly for the sake of its leaves, which form a favorite curry for the lower classes. The fibre of this plant is used generally for cordage. This plant is found in almost every flower-garden. Its flowers are used for Puja and also as a cooling draft by dissolving the petals (of the red flowers alone) in water with sugar. 36 Hedyotis umbellata ...

The fishing in fresh waters is let out in farms, and in the year 1876-77 yielded a revenue of Rs. 13,260 in the aggregate. 8. Common rats, musk rats or blind mice and bandicoots are common everywhere, there bein\u00b0 scarcely a house which is not infested by them. The bites of rats are never easily cured, but they are rare and occur by mere accident. Guana occur in places covered by thickets of trees and shrubs.

Much attention was bestowed upon the census of 1871. It was conducted in accordance with the instructions which the Board of Revenue furnished in elaborate detail/1' and on the whole it may be regarded as the nearest possible approach to accu racy. The system upon which the census was taken on this occasion was briefly this : \u2014 At first a detail ed Register of houses in every village and hamlet was prepared, each house being numbered and the number affixed on its door at the same time ; then a preliminary house-to-house enumeration was conduct ed, and checked first by supervisors and then by the higher Revenue officers; this with other incidental procedure extending over a period of four months ; and lastly the total for each house as given in the enumeration table was corrected by the number of persons who slept in it, all simultaneously in one night.

The following is of a brief notice of each of the seventeen towns specified in the foregoing table. N. Lat. 10\u00b0 48', E. Long, 79\u00b0 12'. This is the capi- tal town of the province. Its name is derived from \" Tanjan,\" a Eakshasa or giant, who according to the legend of the city, haunted its neighbourhood and was destroyed by the God Vishnu ; his name being given to the city at the request made by the dying giant, that it might be so commemorated. W The legendary origin of this city has been indi- cated at the opening of the first chapter. The pro- bable date of tbe first foundation of this city is quite a matter of conjecture ; but there are fair grounds for presuming that it was made his capital by the famous Cola Raja, Kulottunga, in the eleventh century A. D. (See Political History, Chap. II, pp. 51 and 52). The earlier capitals of tbe Cola dynasty were Urayur near Trichinopoly and Combaconum ; probably also one or two other places. From the eleventh century, this city has been succes- sively the seat of three Hindu dynasties, to wit, the Cola, the Nayak and the Mahratta. According to manuscript authority, which seems fairly reliable,'2) tbe small fort, generally called the Sivaganga Fort, which forms a projecting square at the south-west angle of the larger fort, was built by the first Viceroy of Vijayanagar, Sewappa Nayak, in the sixteenth, and the larger fort by the last Nayak Raja Vijaya Raghava in the seventeenth century. In the little fort stands tbe celebrated temple with its tower 199 feet high. (1.) Sanskrit Tanjapuri mahatmya. I have not been able to discover any connection between this legend and the Cola history. (2.) See Political History, Chap. III., p."], [151, "117 At the cession of the country to the British by treaty in 1799, Raja Sarabhoji was permitted to retain the fort of Tanjore, with civil jurisdiction, and upon the death of his son, Eaja Siva j i, without male heirs, in 1855, when the title and dignity of Eaj became extinct, it became merged in British territory. In 1860, the head-quarters of the Collector, which were then at Tranquebar, were removed to Tanjore ; and in 1863, the Zilla or District Court, which was till then at Combaconum, was also removed to this station. It is now the head-quarter station of all departments of administration, including the Police, the Public Works and Eegistration. The Collector's Treasury, tbe Account Department and Eecords are located in the small fort ; but all the other public offices are in the out-lying suburbs south and south-east of the fort. Tanjore is also the principal seat of the S. P. G. in the district and was the scene of the zealous labors in the cause of evangelization of the well known German Missionary, tbe Eev. C. F. Schwartz. The memory of this venerable Missionary is preserv ed by a marble monument, executed by the cele brated artist Flaxman, which stands in the church in the little fort opposite to the Sivaganga tank. Besides the one last-mentioned, there are two Protes tant Churches, the one, Saint Peter's, built in 1779, and the other, a Lutheran Church recently built ; also a Roman Catholic Church with a large congrega tion. There are in this town a College of the S. P. G. Mission, three middle-class schools of the same Mission and one of the same class of the Eoman Catholic Mission, besides several lower class schools. All these are available for general education and open to all classes.

The present population, according to the Imperial census of 1871, is, as shown in the foregoing table, 52,539. The fort, in which is situated the palace of the late Eaja, now in the occupation of his family, is the most thickly-populated part of the town, and is the residence of the principal inhabitants- It is sur rounded by thick masonry walls and a deep moat, and covers an area of 530 acres ; the walls of the fort, however, are being gradually removed. The town of Tanjore is built on a carefully selected site, with due regard to drainage and ventilation, but is very much crowded with houses. The European and East Indian quarters are in a suburb, called \" Manomba* chavadi,\" south-east of the fort. The town outside the fort, inhabited by natives, extends also northward about two miles to the Jembughak kaveri channel north of the river Vennaru. Its greatest length south and north is about 4, and its greatest breadth east and west about 3 miles. The city of Tanjore during the days of the native government was one of the principal seats of manu facturing industry as well as fine arts. Now, music, * \" Mandmbu\" means in Tamil great festival. It is the Dasara festival, at which the Mahratta Rajas used at this place to go through the ceremony of shooting arrows at an Asura enemy (Asura signifying the foe of gods)."], [153, "119 poetry, and painting have to a great extent disappear ed ; but manufactures, chiefly silk-weaving, continue to be carried on to a considerable extent. The class of silk-weavers, called \" Pattunulkarars, an early colony from Guzerat, form a principal section of the popu lation of the outside town. They do not make very good fabrics, so far as texture is concerned ; but they turn out dyed silk yarn of very fair quality, and make fine carpets of silk floss. Tanjore is also noted for native jewellry, pith toys, lace- work, embroidery and flower garlands. The class of workmen at Tanjore, who of all stand out prominently, are brick-masons, and tbe arched buildings which have sprung up of late in the town of Tanjore, as also the innumerable bridges, tunnels and sluices which dot the whole delta of the Cavery, bear testimony to their skill in archi tecture.

It had a strong fort built presumably by the Nayak Bajas in the sixteenth or seventeenth century, which was taken by the English army for the Navab of the Karnatak Payenghat in 1771, and remained in its occupation until its restoration to Eaja Tulzaji, together with the whole Tanjore country, in 1776. (See Political History, Chap. VL, p. 58). Very few traces of the fort, except the moat, now remain. This is one of the healthiest localities in the dis trict ; situated on an elevated level, wrell drained, well ventilated and commanding in ordinary seasons an abundant supply of good wholesome drinking water.

A small but fine town on the north bank of the Cavery, six miles north of Tanjore ; North latitude 10\u00b0 51', East longitude 79\u00b0 10'. It is one of the principal centres of Brahmanical religion with a large temple, which is held more than ordinarily sacred, and is considered to impart special merit to ablutions in the Cavery at this par ticular spot. Tiruveiyaru* is the general resort of aged and pious Brahmans, both men and women, who spend the evenings of their lives and terminate their existence here, in view of the beatification, which is considered to follow death at this place, and hence nearly one-third of the population of this small town consists of Brahmans. On sacred and festival days, streams of visitors may be seen flow ing into Tiruveiyaru from the town of Tanjore. This town, before the general revision of Eevenue establishments in 1860, was the head-quarter station of the taluk, then called after its name \" Tiruvadi.\" It is now the station of a Town Sub-Magistrate and a District Munsiff ; it has also a Eegistration Office, a Police station and a Branch Post Office.

The legend of the origin of this city assigns to it a date immediately after the deluge ; but there can be no doubt of its being one of tbe most ancient towns in the Presidency. It is the centre of the Brahmanical religion and literature ; tbe proportion of Brahman residents being 1836 to the total popula tion of the town ; it was once the capital of the C61a kingdom.

The town con tains a large number of Hindu temples, some of which are grand edifices. Besides the usual annual festivals, one is celebrated at this place once in twelve years, and this grand festival, called \" Maha magham,\" Avhich occurs in February, draws an im mense concourse of visitors from all parts of the country.

Its name is derived from the Sanskrit \" Mayiira\" (peacock). It has a large temple of the name of \" Mayiiranatha svaini,\" and is one of tbe chief seats of the Brahma nical religion in the district. During the \" Tula kaveri\" festival, which extends over the thirty days of the Tamil month of Tula or Arpisi (October and November), ablutions in the river at this place are considered to confer special spiritual benefit, and hence on the closing and more important days of this festival, there is an immense gathering of people from all parts of the district. This town was, almost from the establishment of the British rule in the district until 1860, the head-"], [158, "124 Tranquebar quarter station of the Sub-Collector, and is now the station of a Deputy Collector, as well as of a Tahsildar and a District Munsiff.

A sea-port town, 18 miles north of Negapatam ; North latitude 11\u00b0 1', East longitude 79\u00b0 5-5'. Tran quebar, with a few villages adjoining it, was obtained by the Danes from the Nayak Bajas of Tanjore under a grant in 1620, subject to the payment of an annual rent of Es. 3,111, and remained in their occu pation till 1845, when it was transferred to the Honorable English East India Company by sale, to gether with the other Danish settlements in India. It is a neatly -built town, with, the reputation of being one of the healthy spots on the coast ; it has as a suburb, a large native town, called Poreiya.ru, about a mile and a half west of it. Tranquebar was the first seat of the Protestant Missions in India, and is even now a principal station of the Lutheran Evangelical Missions. There is also a Eoman Catho lic Church. In 1845, when this settlement became part of the British territory, the Collector's head-quarters, which were till then at Negapatam, were removed to this station and remained there until 1860, when they were removed to Tanjore. In the year last mentioned, a new Zilla Court was established at this station, but was removed to Negapatam in 1874 and shortly after abolished ; it has again now recently"], [159, "125 been re-established at this station.

At the last census of 1871 it was 15,040. The total re venue of the Tranquebar settlement, including the Land and Sea Customs and the Salt Monopoly, for the year 1809 (also a year of the British occupa tion), when the trade was depressed and the settle ment had been reduced to an impoverished state by the events of the war of 1807, was Rs. 56,000.

The administration of all matters relating to Local Fund Boards rural economy, embracing Communications, Schools, Medical and Vaccine establishments and Public Charitable endowments, is vested, by Madras Act IV of 1871, in Circle Boards composed of a number of official and non-official members presided over by the Collector of the district. The district is formed for this purpose into two Circles, the one designated the Tanjore and the other the Negapatam Circle ; the Tanjore Circle comprising the taluks of Tanjore, Combaconum, Mannargudi and Pattukottei, and the"], [174, "140 Negapatam Circle those of Negapatam, Nannilam, Mayaveram, Shiyali (Sirgbali) and Tiruttireipiindi. 11, The assets available in Tanjore for the vari ous services comprised within the scope ofthe Local Funds Act are : \u2014 (1.) A cess on land ; (the maximum rate allowed by the Act is one anna m the rupee on the annual rent value ; but in Tanjore, it is levied at the rate of three-quarters of an anna.) (2.) The surplus collections of Cattle Pounds. (3). Fish rent. (4). One-third of the tolls collected on carriages, carts and animals at Municipal toll gates. (5). Rent and produce of lands constituting the endowments of chattrams or houses of charity. (6) . Money-allowances which are paid from the Imperial revenues, under treaties and en- gagements, to some of the chattrams. (7). Interest on the funded capital of public dispensaries and chattrams. (8). Grants from Provincial Funds and other small miscellaneous items. The Local Funds Act provides also for the levy of a tax. on houses and tolls on carriages, carts and animals passing along the roads within the Local Fund circle ; but these imposts have not been intro duced into this district. 12. For administrative purposes, the Local Fund is divided under three heads, to wit I, Road Fund ; II, Endowment Fund ; and III, General Fund. The Eoad Fund is made up of two-thirds of the Land cess collections and the second, third and fourth items above enumerated, with a few other small miscellane-"], [175, "141 ous receipts; under this head is included all outlay on communications. The Endowment Fund is made up of the fifth, sixth and seventh items, with such appropriations as may be made from the General Fund for dispensaries not situated in Municipalities and for the conjee-house at Tanjore; under this head is comprised all expenditure on chattrams or charitable feeding-houses and on rural dispensaries. The General Fund consists of the remaining one third of the Land cess collections, receipts from the avenues of roads, contributions by the people and a few petty miscellaneous items ; this head covers all expenditure on Schools, and on Sanitary Conservancy generally.

ETHNOLOGY. The ethnology of Tanjore differs very little from that of the other parts of southern India. The races which inhabit the district may be broadly dis tributed under three heads or divisions, to wit (1) Those who claim Aryan descent, (2) The Pre-Aryan, and (3) The cross-bred. 2. In reference to the first division, it is necessary to premise, that the introduction of the Aryan civiliz ation into the south of India was the result not of conquest, but of a peaceable and gradual process of colonization, and that the colonists were exclusively Brahmans from the north. There is nothing to show that there was ever a warlike irruption of the Ksha triya soldiery; all traditions being restricted to Brah manical immigrations. Indeed, the obviously conci liatory and conservative course pursued by the colonists, of which abundance of proof is found in the religion of the country and the philology of its dialects, points distinctly to an intellectual body of priestly colonists holding, in the absence of that authority which conquest gives, the relation of friend ly instructors and welcome guides to the pre- Aryan population, which had established itself firmly in the country, and had already attained to a certain degree of civilization. 3. Hence, the portion of the population of the south wrhich represents the Aryan colonies is almost wholly Brahmanical, and from the nature of the case, its relative proportion, including subsequent immi grations, to the entire population, is necessarily very small. In Tanjore, one of the principal seats of Brahmans, itis 6\"42 per cent.; but taking the Madras Presidency as a whole, less Ganjam and South 20"], [184, "150 Canara, which, for reasons hereafter explained, require to be excluded; it is just 3 per cent. 4. The purity of the Aryan blood preserved by Brahmans has been recently the subject of much learned comment. As it is not, however, denied that \"Brahmans everywhere have been exceed ingly cares id in the preservation of the purity of their blood;\" it may at least be conceded, upon the authority of the Rev. Mr. Sherring,\u00ab that they are \" the least affected\" by that \" occasional taint\" of aboriginal blood, which might be supposed to have at an early period entered into the ethnical composi tion of the primitive divisions of the Aryan colonies of India. By Brahmans here is meant of course only those tribes of undoubted Brahmanical origin, which are easily recognized as such by all classes of the Indian population, and not those degenerate and spurious classes described by Dr. Hunter in his highly interesting work on Orissa. It may perhaps be here observed, that Dr. Caldwell, evidently the most accurate observer of the ethnical constitution of the population of the south, entertains no doubt that Brahmans are \" a perfectly pure unmixed race.\"(2) 5. The only other tribes comprised under the general head \" Hindus,\" which claim Aryan descent are, the Rajputs, the Mahrattas (other than Brah mans), the Rachevars or Kazus and the trading class which bears the designation of Komatis. Of these several tribes, the first three claim to be ranked as the \" Kshatriya\" or warrior class, and the last as the Vaisya or trading class. 6. It is unnecessary to go into the question of the purity or impurity of the Kshatriya stock as it is repre sented by the great body of Rajputs of the north ; for there are very few families of this caste down (1) S. H. T. and C Intro., p. 22, aud Part I. pages 7 and 80. (2) C. C. G. D. h., p. 514."], [185, "151 south, and hardly any in districts situated in the extreme south. In Tanjore, according to the last census, there are just 27 persons, including women and children of the Rajput caste. These are appa rently the representatives of a few families,* which emigrated to the south in search of livelihood in the humbler walks of life in recent days, and do not belong to any of those royal families in the north, which may be regarded as preserving any considerable pro portion of the pure Kshatriya blood of the early Aryan settlers ; they can at best be viewed only as of mixed Aryan and Turanian blood. (See Sherring Intro., p. 22, and Part III, p. 247). 7. Of Mahrattas, a detailed account will be found in the chapter on castes; it is sufficient here to observe, that they are evidently a race of mixed Aryan and Tu ranian blood with, very probably, a large preponder ance of the former. Nothing is known of the clan of Telugu-speaking people, wdio bear the title \" Ra chevars\" or \" Raziis,\" except that they are a colony from the Telugu country. They belong probably to the class of \" Andhra Kshatriyas\" referred to in Mr. Boswell's Manual of Nellore, and if such is the case, the utmost that can be conceded to this clan is to place it on the same footing as the 27 Rajputs ; but it seems more than doubtful whether the so called Andhra Kshatriyas have any claim to Rajput origin. Apparently, the claim rests merely on their having entered the Military service. 8. As to the Vaisya caste, it seems really doubtful whether any such distinct division of the Aryan com munity ever existed in the north except at the date of Manu. (See Sherring, p. 247). The only class, however, among the various trading communities in Tanjore, who are popularly believed to be of tbe Vaisya caste, are K6matis ; but there is nothing to"], [186, "152 The second Divi sion\u2014 pre-AryanColo. nies. show whence this community came, and apparently the term \" K6mati\" is unknown in northern India. From their strictly and uniformly maintaining many Aryan customs, however, it may perhaps be presum ed, that they came from the north several centuries ago, and have ever since persistently preserved from further alloy such mixed blood as they brought with them. 9. The second head or ethnical division consists of the Turanian races, which had colonized the greater part of India prior to the arrival of tho Aryans, and makes up the bulk of the present popu- ation of the south. By the discovery of clear radical analogies between the Dravidian or southern lan- guages and the Brahui as well as the idiom of one of the Behistun tablets of the fifth century B. C. ; Dr. Caldwell has satisfactorily established two distinct propositions. The first is, that the Dravidian lan- guages belong to the Scythian group, bearing the closest affinity to the Urgo-Finnic family, \u2014 a fact which points to the central tracts of Asia as the pri- mary seat of the Dravidian inhabitants of the south. The second is, that these races after parting company with the rest of the Urgo-Turanian horde, and drop- ping a colony in Beluchistan, entered India from the north-west. (3) Further, from the difference, which is found to exist between the Dravidian languages and the Scythian understratum of the northern ver- naculars, Dr. Caldwell deduces the inference, that the Dravidian inhabitants of the south are not identifiable with the \" dasyus\" and \" mlechhas,\" who disputed the progress of the Aryans, on their first crossing the Hindus, but that they belong to older Scythian colonies, which were supplanted and driven south wards by tbe dasyus and mlechhas at a later date.(4> (3) Ibid., p. 43-46, (4) Ibid . p. 70,"], [187, "153 The third Division -Mixed races. 10. Among the innumerable minor sections into which this large community is split up, some few are no doubt the result of admixture between the early Turanian colonies and recent immigrants from other parts of the peninsula, such for instance as the Telugu speaking classes, who settled in the districts of the south during the days of the Vijayanagar dynasty in tbe course of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen turies A. D. But there is no reason to suppose, that the latter in any way differ in race from the general Dravidian or Turanian population of the country. The Mahratta colony from the Dakhan which settled in Tanjore in the latter end of the seventeenth cen tury has strictly maintained its distinctive ethnical element and has never admitted into its class children born in adultery or concubinage with Dravidian woman; such offspring constitutes a distinct and numerically insignificant class, of which perhaps there is a slight and hardly perceptible transfusion among the lower classes of the Dravidian population. 11. The community, however, which comes pro minently to view under this head is that of the Tamil-speaking Mahomedans, called Labbes or Sona kars, a race of mixed Semitic and Turarian blood. They are the descendants of the early colonists from Arabia, who emigrated from their native land in the early part of the eighth century, in consequence of the tyrannical sway of Hijajben Yusef, and to whom the coast line of Tanjore, as commanding a never failing trade in rice with Ceylon, held out special attractions. First establishing themselves, as else where, on the coast, they have in course of time crept into the interior, and have everywhere adopted the language of the country. In the absence of all restraint, rehgious or social, they, on their first settle ment, took women of the lowest classes as both wives"], [188, "154 and concubines, and also admitted into their house holds and made members of their own families, young boys as well as girls of the same class, who were either parted with for a consideration or abandoned by their relations during the prevalence of famines and general distress. And the resulting cross-bred race, with free concubinage and widow marriage, has rapidly multiplied and is multiplying. (See Chapter I of this Part, p. 7.) 12. This class includes probably also a slight admixture of Hindus circumcised by force, though such conversions could not have taken place in Tan jore itself, which was never under direct Mahome dan rule, except during the two or three years of Navab Mahomed Ali's temporary occupation of the country in the latter part of the last century. The line of separation between these Tamil-speaking Mahomedans and the general Dravidian population has always been broad and distinctly marked. 13. The Labbes who inhabit the coast have the honorific title \" Marakkayar,\" and those who have settled in the interior that of \"Ravuttar.\" The whole class are a peaceable, industrious and well conducted people, presenting a striking contrast to the fanatic Moplas of the west coast. 14. The Labbe class constitute more than four fifths of tbe Mahomedan population of Tanjore ; and there is little reason to suppose, that the ethnical composition of the other classes of Mahomedans in this country differs very materially from theirs. Already \" a mixed race \u2014 a colluvies gentium \u2014 com prising various tribes and races of Mongolian and Tartar \u2014 Turkish origin,\"(5) the general body of Mahomedan invaders on their first settlement in this (5) Ibid, p. 515."], [189, "155 country wTere not very particular about preserving the purity of blood such as they brought with them. Caste rules, in respect of intermarriage, are now observed more or less by all classes of Mahomedans (the Labbes not excepted) ; but the custom is recent. At any rate, they at no time exercised much dis crimination in the selection of women for tbeir con cubines, and the offspring of their concubines, for all practical purposes, have become incorporated with their own race. It is to be doubted, moreover, whether more than a small proportion of the num bers returned at the late census as Patans and Moguls, really belong to those races ; for, all cross bred Mahomedans, on account of the dignity attach ing to the name, call themselves Patans cr Moguls, and apparently all such have been included under those heads. 15.

Thus, for instance, among the sub castes of Brahmans, there is an entry \" Brahmans,\" under which appear 112,580 persons out of a total of 126,757, and among the sub-castes of Vellalars there is an entry \" Vellalars with 152,032 out of a total of 181,551 ; the difference alone being distributed among the details which ought properly to make up the whole. The Census tables were compiled at Madras from original schedules, which have been destroyed. The figures given in this table include native christians, who number 65,262, and to whom the religious persuasion denoted opposite to each caste, of course does not apply. They cannot be separated as the number comprised in each caste as specified in this table is not ascertainable from the Census tables.

From what has been stated in the chapter on Ethnology, it will be apparent that the minor castes of the south bear no analogy to those formulated in Manii's code. They are not, like their northern model, the outcome of intermarriages and irregular intercourse among the primary divisions, which necessitated the creation of new and minor divisions, in order that the primary ones might not become vitiated. 3. The system of minor castes in the south is a purely social organization, based in the main on the distribution of employments and callings. It is not known when it was inti'oduced into the south ; but there can be little doubt, that it was introduced by Brahmans, and that when they brought it with them, it had become fossilized in northern India by the rigid prohibition of intermarriages between different castes. Very probably, there already existed a dis tribution of arts and callings, which was developed into a system of minor castes after the northern model. Already complex, this system became more and more complicated in the course of the pro gressive colonization of the country by immigrants from other parts of the south and the progressive development of arts and callings. Further, as men rise in affluence, they strive to rise also in the scale of castes, and now and then succeed in forming alli ances with higher castes, whereby new intermediate castes are created. Illegitimacy of birth is another element which brings new castes into existence. 4. The following quotation from the interest ing work of the Rev. Mr. Sherring, though it spe cially refers to the north, applies also in the main to the subsequent multiplication of minor castes in the south. \" How it came to pass that castes became"], [197, "163 Brahmans split up into a number of sub-divisions, each cherish ing a spirit of iron exclusiveness in regard to the rest, is a question much more easy of solution * * * *. Many of these sub-divisional distinctions are territorial, and were occasioned by the dispersion of a caste, which thenceforward became known by appellations superadded to its own, denoting the towns, cities or districts, in which its scattered mem bers resided. In this manner the caste separated into clans, each of which managed its own affairs, held panchayats or councils, and maintained a dis tinct and independent existence. As these clans were not amenable to one another or to the caste itself considered as a federal whole, gradually they became jealous of each other's rights, and at length, impelled by the national habit of exclusiveness, abandoned one another reciprocally, and assumed to themselves absolutely all the functions and preroga tives of castes. \"(1> 5. The various castes, as they stand now, have been divided in the table above given under four general heads thus : \u2014 A. Brahmans. B. All castes between Brahmans and ihose re garded as markedly inferior castes. C. Markedly inferior castes. D. Pareiya or out-caste tribes. 6. In Tanjore, there are six Brahmanical com munities, distinguishable by the languages they speak, to wit : (1) Dravida in the more restricted sense of the term, i. e. Tamilians or those who speak the Tamil language. (2) Andhra, (Telugu) (1) Intro , p. 23."], [198, "164 (3) Maharashtra, (Mahratta) (4) Konkanese, (5) Kanarese, (6) Guzarati, The Dravida or Tamil Brahmans are the earliest colonists and constitute the bulk of the Brahmanical population ot the district. It is here to be observed that these various com munities speak the languages, and to a great extent follow the manners and customs of the countries of their first settlement, of which by long residence they became natives. It is in this respect only that each community is distinguishable from the rest, and if only the degenerate and spurious tribes de scribed by Dr. Hunter are excluded, ethnically they are the same race. 7. The dates of the early Brahmanical immigra tions, like those of other events in the early history of the south, are a mere matter of speculation. The first colony of Brahmans is said to have been led to the southern extremity of the peninsula by Agastya Rishi, the father of Tamil literature, soon after Rama's conquest of Ceylon ; and the event, assum ing it to have been synchronical more or less with the first foundation of the aboriginal dynasties of Pandya and Cola, may be taken to have occurred about five or six centuries B. C. (See the first chap ter on Political history). This first colony, however, must have been comparatively very small, and pro bably it was not until after the decline of Buddhism and the revival of the Brahmanical creed in the fifth or sixth century A. D., that fresh colonies of Brah mans in considerable numbers flowed in.(2) (2.) Wheeler's History of India, the third of the series, p. 360 note. Hunter's Orissa, vol. I, p. 261. Dates o\u00a3 their im migrations."], [199, "165 Tamil Brahmans oo 8. These latter probably settled first on the banks of the Godavery and the Krishna, the nearest eligible sites in their southward course, and thence spread further south, at a later date. It is also possible that the more recent immigrations from northern India date subsequent to the Mahomedan conquest of Hindustan at the end of the twelfth century and the movements from the northern to the southern portions of the peninsula subsequent to the capture of Orukkal or Orungal and the annihilation of the Telingana monarchy by the Mahomedans, followed almost immediately by the foundation of the Hindu empire of Vijayanagar on the Tungabhadra, in the early part of the fourteenth century. 9. A considerable body of the Tamil Brahmans in the south are known by the tribal distinction of \" Vadamals\" or northerns and are sub-divided into Vadamals of Cdladesam and Vadamals of Vadade sam (literally northerns of the Cola country and northerns of the northern country) ; the distinction signifying apparently early and later colonies. The northern country here means the country about Kanchipuram or Conjeveram. Another considerable body are called \" Ashta Sahasrum\" (eight thou sand), and this designation, while it indicates the numerical strength of the community (probably num ber of families) when it entered the southern coun tries, shows at the same time also that they must have been foreigners. Another tribe is designated \" Vattimils,\" literally teachers, and these, as the tradition goes, came at a later period from the Tam raparni valley where they had first settled. The most numerous are Vadamals and Ashtasahasrals, and the Aiyangar or Srivaishnava sects are mostly branches of the Vadama community."], [200, "166 10. The comparatively recent colonies of Brah- mans, bringing with them a more rigid caste system, were of course not disposed to recognize a complete ethnical identity in the early settlers of their class, and hence it is, that certain Brahmanical commu- nities, to wit Cdliyars, K\u00a3sikals and Gurukkals (the last being the class whose exclusive occupation is to officiate in temples), have become isolated and are regarded by the rest of the Brahmanical classes to be of doubtful purity. A legend relating to Guruk- kals is, that they are sprung from the offspring of an unmarried couple of Brahman caste. It is to be observed, however, that these isolated communi- ties strictly maintain all the rules of the Brahmani- cal creed ; they do not intermarry or otherwise mix with any non-Brahmanical caste. Brahmans of other 11. The immigrations of Brahmans of other nationalities. , . -. . .. \u00ab , \u25a0, , \u00bb nationalities are ot very recent dates. Amongst these foreign Brahmans, as they still continue to be regarded, the Telugus are the most numerous; next to these in point of numerical strength are Mahrattas, and next to the latter, the Kanarese; the Guzaratis and Konkanese are the fewest. There are the non- Brahmanical communities of these two last nation- alities. 12. The Telugu Brahmans came into this dis- trict apparently during the days of the Vijayana- - gar Viceroys in the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the Mahratta and Kon- kanese Brahmans in the latter end ofthe seventeenth century, when Tanjore became a Mahratta settlement by conquest. (3) The Guzarati Brahmans pursuing (3) The families of this nation, which are found scattered in other parts of the Madras Presidency, were introduced chiefly in the course of the same century, successively by Shahji who, coming out as a general in command of the Bijapur army, reduced the greater part of the territory known as the Bijapur Karnatak, and by his son, the great Sivaji, who during his memorable irruption in 1677 seized those possessions."], [201, "167 Intermarriages. Religious sects. their mercantile callings, followed in the track of the Mahrattas. The settlements of Kanarese Brah mans in Tanjore belong almost wholly to the days of the British administration; they consist of families of colonists who, coming out from Coimbatore andBalaghat on Government service or as dependents of those who came out on Government service, settled here in consideration of the fertility and the generally inviting character of the Cauvery delta. The countries of the Kanarese and the Mahrattas being contiguous, the habits and social customs of these two nations are in many respects identical, and hence the mistake which is so often made of confound ing the Kanarese with the Mahratta Brahmans. The Kanarese Brahmans here referred to are of the Madhva sect. There are a few Kanarese families of the Oaiva sect at Combaconum, and these came apparently from Mysore and settled here as depend ents of Sankaracaryar's matham in the eighth or ninth century A. D. 13. It will be seen that the Mahratta, the Kon kanese and the Guzarati Brahmans are not sub divided into minor sections. They intermarry among their own community, and it is but rarely that inter marriages between the Mahrattas and the Konkanese, (the latter as already stated speak Marathi) take place ; the Guzaratis are entirely distinct. Among the Tamil, the Telugu and the Kanarese Brahmans, intermarriages are rigidly restricted to the sub-divi sion. 14. In regard to religious sects it may be generally stated, that, all true Brahmans are bound by the Vedas, and it is their exclusive privilege to observe the forms of worship and sacrificial rites therein prescribed. The designation as \" Caiva\" of one of the two great sects into which Brahmans are"], [202, "168 Characteristic fea tures of social life. divided, is not strictly correct inasmuch as, with the exception of a few individuals who hold special Caiva tenets, all those communities which are classed as Caiva, worship Vishnu as well and observe almost all the ceremonies and festivals in honor of that deity. These so-called communities of the Caiva sect are followers of the Advaita philosophy expounded by Sankaracarya in the eighth or ninth century A. D., and are designated by common consent \" Smarta.''*4' All Brahmans of the Vaishnava sect, however, are exclusive, and, in following their own tenets, evince even a spirit of hostility towards Smartas. The proper designations, therefore, of the two great sects of Brahman communities are Smarta and Vaishnava ; the former comprising the great majority. Each of these divisions includes all nationalities. The Smarta division is not sub divided in regard to forms of worship ; the Vaish nava is divided into two sects, Srivaishnava or Aiyangar and Madhva ; the former founded by Ramanujacarya in the twelfth and the latter by Madhvacarya in the thirteenth century A. D. The Aiyangars in Tanjore are almost exclusively Dravidians or Tamilians of the Vadama section, and the Madhvas are partly Mahrattas and partly Kana rese ; neither of these minor sects in Tanjore com prises Telugu Brahmans, who are all, like the great majority of Tamil Brahmans, Smartas. 15. The social and religious observances which distinguish Brahmans from all other classes, are briefly : \u2014 (I) , The prohibition of widow marriage. (2) The prohibition of concubinage. (4) Derived from \" Smriti,\" the coda of ceremonial and legal institutes of the Hindus. The term literally signifies that which is remembered."], [203, "169 (3) The betrothal of girls and the ceremony of Upanayanam (initiation into the Brah manical order) of boys within a certain age. (The prescribed age in both cases is 8 ; and the ceremony is never, under any circumstances, delayed beyond the twelfth year. In the case of a girl, the object of the greatest anxiety in a Brah man family is to dispose of her in mar- riage before the age last indicated). (4) The performance of the prescribed rites for the benefit of the departed souls of parents on the exact anniversary days of their deaths. (5) The strict avoidance of the worship of evil spirits, except in so far that it is incorpor ated into Puranas in a refined and aryan ized form. (Sacrifice of animals strict- ly excluded). (6) Abstinence from animal food (milk and but- ter excepted) and alcohol. 16. These rules with the exception of 2 and 6 are universally observed ; not even the most indifferent Brahman could neglect them. Concubinage is very rarely openly indulged in, and on the whole is less common among Brahmans than among other castes. The secret use of alcoholic drinks and flesh meat is increasing among Brahmans in Tanjore, but is still restricted to a comparatively few circles ; the great majority scrupulously abstaining from both alike. All the rules enumerated in the preceding para, are now observed more or less by non-Brah manical high castes ; but the difference consists in this : \u2014 the Brahmans cannot neglect 1, 3 and 4 with out ceasing to be Brahmans ; while other castes run"], [204, "170 Character and con dition of the several Brahmanical com munities. Tamil Brahmans. Telugu Brahmans no similar risk thereby. Brahmans do not neglect these rules, because from the nature of the case they cannot conceal the neglect. 17. Of the several Brahmanical communities in Tanjore, the Dravidas or Tamilians, notably the Aiyangar section, are by far the most industri ous and thrifty, as well as intelligent ; they are at present the most rising and prosperous. There is hardly a pursuit, literary, industrial or professional, to which they do not apply themselves with remark able success. They are found in all grades and in all departments of the Government service; as plead ers they are pre-eminently successful. No class of people have availed themselves, to the extent the Tamil Brahmans have, of the education imparted by the Combaconum College and other schools scattered over the district, and the great majority of the Tan joreans, who have obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts, are of this class. There is hardly a family of Tamil Brahmans, which does not possess a com petence in landed property ; many own valuable estates. Agriculture is the primary occupation of all not employed in Government service ; but many pursue trade. Whatever calling they pursue, the one object of every Tamil Brahman, whether he be a Government servant, a trader or a menial, is to reserve his earnings to augment his ancestral estate, large or small, whatever it is. 18. Of the Telugu Brahmans, the secular class called \" Niyogis,\" are quite as enterprising as the Tamil Brahmans ; they are chiefly employed in the Government service. The vaidik or ecclesiastical class earn their livelihood by priestly office, more especially as Panchangis or ministers of sMdras ; they are generally poor. On the whole the Telugu Brah-"], [205, "171 mans are a quiet and respectable class. Many of both classes possess landed property in small holdings. 19. The Mahratta Brahmans belong chiefly to Mahratta Brahmans the colony planted in Tanjore by the first Mahratta Raja, Yekdji in the latter end of the seventeenth cen tury. They till recently enjoyed a high reputation for intellectual superiority and administrative skill,(5) as well as for moral character, but are now a depress ed race and are losing their prestige. The descendants of the early colony of Mahratta Brahmans are almost wholly congregated in the fort of Tanjore, and the generality in a state of great depression and indigence. 20. In a Mahratta family, Brahman or Cudra, women hold a higher rank than is assigned to them in any other community ; they are treated with much consideration and exercise much influence over their husbands. They are on their part generally kindly and open-hearted, and their improvidence and propensity to spending are often the cause of the bankruptcy which is, and has more or less always been, the normal condition of Mahratta families generally. 21. There are but a few Konkanese and Guzarati ,,Th,e .Konkanese, the Guzarati and the Brahman families, and these are likewise congregat- Kanarese Brahmans. ed in the fort of Tanjore.

The next division (B), comprising as it does more than two-thirds of the general Hindu popula tion, is by far the most important. 23. As stated in the chapter on Ethnology, just twenty-seven persons of the Rajput caste were returned at the census taken in 1871. They bear the title Sing, wear the sacred thread and speak the Hindustani language. They are descendants apparently of individual immigrants of a recent date from northern India, They jealously maintain their castes. 24. This designation, as also the account which follows, refers to what Duff calls the Military class who alone are associated with the political history of Tanjore. In fact, it is to this class that, as pointed out by that accurate historian, the term Mahratta is applied in the Dakhan. (8> It of course does not include Brahmans. 25. \" Mahratta\" is a corruption of the Sanskrit \" Maharashtra\" which means literally the grand nation. The ancient Maharashtras who spoke the old Prakrit dialect called \" Maharashtri\" occupied the south of Raj apu tana together with a consider able portion of the present northern Mahratta coun try.

They are clearly a different race from the great mass of the Dravidian population of the south. Their language is essentially Aryan ; their vocabulary alone contains a certain proportion of Turanian words, due apparently to intercourse with their Dravidian neigh bours, the inhabitants of Telingana and Karnata; but their grammatical forms are of pure Indo- European type ; their pronouns, their numerals and in fact every thing that constitutes the vitality of a language is derived from either Sanskrit or from those primitive Aryan speeches, of which Sanskrit is the fullest development. Unlike their Turanian neighbours, they have retained few traces of pre- Aryan social life, such as demonolatry and widow marriage. Leaving the Aryan centre in northern India apparently at a very early period, they must have occupied the present Mahratta country in over whelming numbers and, with the aid persumably of their Brahman instructors, thoroughly Aryanized it in language, religion and forms of civilization. 26. The Mahratta colonists of Tanjore consist of two classes, higher and lower; the higher com prising the ninety-six families known \" as Qannau gulya,\" to which class belong the Rajas and their relations, and the lower their soldiery and followers. (10) n. H. M., pp. 1 and 2, (11) Ibid., p. 8. 23"], [208, "174 In Tanjore, both have maintained their indivi dualities, neither intermarrying with the other or with the natives of the country ; the prohi bition in the latter case being rigid and absolute. Both have sometimes taken native women of the lower castes for their concubines ; but the offspring of such connections have always been regarded as illegitimate and never engrafted on the pure Mah ratta families. The illegitimate offspring in all such cases constitute a distinct class, speaking the Mah rathi language, designated by the Dravidian appella tions Appa and Anna, and may in a measure be regarded as a mixed race ; but the class is numerically very small. In fact, the Mahratta epeaking communities form no considerable propor tion of the population of Tanjore. According to the last census, the total number of Mahrattas, including apparently the mixed classes just referred to, is only 6,800 ; while that of the Telugu nation known by the designation \"Kavarei\" is 107,113. 27. It is indeed remarkable that while the rules of the Nayak and the Mahratta Rajas extended over about the same period, i.e., a century and a quarter ; the Mahratta colony in Tanjore should be so small compared with that of the Telugu nation. The fact presumably is, that the dominion of the Telugu or, as it is sometimes called Narasinga, dynasty of the Vijayanagar empire extended over the whole of southern India, including Tanjore, a century and more before the conquest of Tanjore by Nagama Nayak in the sixteenth century, and that large colonies of the Telugu-speaking people had settled in this as in other districts of the south, before the event last mentioned. Probably also, the rise of the Mahratta power in the Dakhan in the early part of the eighteenth century and its subsequent extension over"], [209, "175 Malva and Hindustan precluded any large colonies of the Mahratta nation being drawn to Tanjore. 28. All Mahrattas wear the sacred thread, but in no other respect follow the customs of Brahmans. They are, as a rule, followers of the Qaiva religion, but observe all the Vaishnava ceremonies and festi vals almost as much as people of that sect. 29. A description of the Mahratta Rajas of Tanjore will be found in the chapter on the Political history of the district. As regards the general class, if they brought with them any of their warlike spiritor predatory habits from the Dakhan, both evidently left them soon after their arrival at Tanjore. They are, and always have been, perfect strangers to robbery or dacoity, which in this country are the exclusive callings of particular tribes of the aboriginal popu lation. They are a timid, as well as a perfectly peace-loving and law-abiding, race ; generally kind and generous to their neighbours. Their women are treated with respect and consideration ; they are, in the words of Duff, \" the help-mates and by no means the slaves of their husbands. \"(12) The Mahrattas of the higher or Qannaugulya rank are, however, strictly subject to the Gosha rules. In the Raja's palace, the apartments appropriated to ladies are totally inaccessible to any but women; the windows of the apartments are provided with bored shutters, through which the ladies may see all that passes through the streets ; but they may not be seen by any males, save their nearest relatives. When they have to go out, the passage is cleared of all males and they are conveyed in carriages or palk'his (palanquins) provided like (12) Ibid, p. 8."], [210, "176 Bichevars, K.matfs jetties other than Komatis their apartments with bored shutters or covered with curtains. The Mahratta race are, as a rule, deficient in intellect, and present a striking contrast to Brahmans of their nation. They are also wranting in industry and application ; while at the same time they are improvident, thriftless and given to luxury. Since the death of the late Raja, they have been reduced to much distress and are altogether a depressed race. What has been said of Mahratta Brahmans applies in a greater measure to this non- Brahmanical community 30. These are descendants of immigrants from the Telugu country, who apparently followed the Nayak viceroys of the Vijayanagar empire in the sixteenth century. They are more or less jealous of the purity of their caste. Their language is Telugu. This class also wears thread. 31 . The Kdmatiswear the sacred thread, perform the ceremony of \" Upanayanam\" (the initiation of second birth), and abstain from animal food. Their women are dressed exactly like Telugu Brahmani women. The Kdmatis call themselves Vaisya and have their G6tras or Aryan pedigrees. Their special occupation is trade, and they are proverbially shrewd, industrious and thrifty and generally wealthy. They are generally honest in their dealings and altogether a respectable tribe. The K6matis almost everywhere in the south bear the title \" petti,\" which means simply merchant; but they do not belong to the caste designated by this name ; the term in its application to them being held to denote merely a title of rank. .32. This is the general trading class, and its sub divisions had reference originally probably to terri-"], [211, "177 torial and commercial distinctions, each of which latterly assumed the form of a distinct caste. The main sub-divisions, so far as they are known, are : \u2014 1. Vellalan Cetti. 2. Cdlapuram (^etti. 3. Sittakkadu Cetti. 4. Adudurei Qetti. 5. Nonakkadu Qetti. 6. Tiruppundi Cetti. 7. Arupattunalu Taleikkattu C, etti 8. Tamil Vyapari Cetti. 9. Telungu Vyapari petti. 10. Panju Qetti. 33. The name of the first indicates merely that the pettis are of the Vellala caste, and those of 2 to 6 denote the places of their original habitation (all in the Tanjore district). The seventh means the sixty-four who bound (covered) their heads. Probably, sixty-four families first obtained by royal grant the privilege of wearing a head cloth or brought it with them from elsewhere. The eighth and ninth mean traders of the Tamil and Telugu countries respectively. The tenth probably means cotton traders ; the word \" panju\" being applied in common parlance to cotton. 34. These ten divisions represent the primary institution of \"Cetti castes ; but inferior castes which have entered upon trade have assumed the title Cetti, and evidently all such are included under this head in the census tables. Men of ordinary Palli or Vannia castes, as they rise in the world, assume the title of petti or Pillei, according as they pursue trade or agriculture ; and the classes of pettis and Pilleis thus newly formed have now become so numerous"], [212, "178 Ndttuk.ttei Cetti, VelHUrs that it is difficult to distinguish the true castes from them. Some of the petti families abstain from animal food and otherwise follow the pure Vellala customs, and very probably they are of the true Vellala caste. The occupation of petti classes in Tanjore is almost wholly trade. 35. Nattukdttei pettis do not belong to the pure petti caste. Their birthplace is near Sivaganga in Madura, and they have no fixed residence in Tanjore except at Negapatam, where a community of them carry on trade. The available information regarding this class of traders will be found in the Madura Manual ;(13) but nothing is known in Tanjore of their alleged emigration at a very early period from Kaveripattanam near the mouth of the Cauvery. The Nattukdttei pettis are considered here to be of a low caste; whereas the petti families which originally resided at Kaveripattanam are held to be of a very superior status among the Vellala class. 36. The word \" Vellalan\" agriculturist, as well as its cognate \" Vellanmei\", agriculture, is derived from \" Vellam\" flood or water; \"Alan\" signifying ruler and \" Anmei\" control or management. The principal Vellala tribes, as they are known in Tan jore, are : \u2014 1. Cdliya 2. Pandi or Kareikkattar. 3. Konga. 4. Tuluva. 5. Kondeikatti. 6. Kodikkal. 7. Kaniala. 8. Mudalis of Tondamandala Melanadu. (13) Part II, page 68."], [213, "179 9. Modalis of Tondamandala Kilanadu. 10. Ponneri Mudalis. 11. Pundamalli Mudali. 12. Pandarams or priests. 37. The names of the first four denote the nativities of the respective tribes, to wit, C61a, Pandya, Konga and Tuluva. The Pandi Vellalars are also called Kareikkattar,\" a compound term derived from \" Kar\" \" water,\" and \" kattar\" \" those who waited for ;\" the tradition being, that it was the peculiar function of this community to stand in the field demanding and waiting for, that is invoking, rain. \" Kondeikatti\" means those who wear a tuft of hair done up into a knob on the top of the head. \" Kodikkal\" means betel garden, and the name is derived apparently from the particular section having adopted or been assigned the cultivation of betel gardens as their exclusive calling. \" K_ni_la\" is a compound of \" Kani\" land, and \" Alan\" ruler, that is landowner. It will be seen, there is a corresponding sub-division among Tamil Brahmans. \" Mudali,\" means the first man or chief, and apparently this title came into existence for the first time in the sixteenth century, when Arya Nayaka Mudali, the famous minister and general of Visvanatha Nayak, the Vijayanagar viceroy of Madura, was invested with it. The names of the four Mudali clans, viz., the Mudalis of the Melanadu and Kilanadu (western and eastern divisions of Tondamandalam) and of Pundamalli, and Ponneri, indicate presumably the localities of their early settlement. Pandarums are the priests of the Vellala class. 38. All Vellalars, who have not inherited, or as sumed as many have done of late, the title of \" Mu dali,\" have the common one of \" Pillei,\" which means"], [214, "180 literally \" son,\" and was probably, as Mr. Nelson says, adopted by the early Brahman settlers and latterly by the VelMlars as denoting \" sons of gods.\" 39. Various traditions are extant regarding the Vellala settlement of the south ; but each refers ob viously to one of the minor divisions and none ex plains the origin of the class as a whole. According to Mr. Ellis's valuable paper on the Mirasi tenure of Tondamandalam, the Vellalars wrere at their first settlement in that country divided into three tribes : the first were \" Kondeikatti,\" whom Adandacakra varti found in the country in small numbers scattered in distant settlements ; the second were Coliya who accompanied him from the Cola country, but most of whom, as the tradition went, returned in disgust in consequence of the difficulty which they experienc ed in clearing the ground and the small profits which their labors yielded ; and the third were Tu luva Vellalars who immigrated from the Tuluvu country and constituted by far the greater body of the Vellala settlers. (u) A manuscript abstracted in Rev. Mr. Taylor's Catalogue Raisonne (15) relates that a Pandya king of Madura, named Ugra, pro cured a colony of 48,000 Vellalars from the neigh bourhood of Kaveripattanam near the mouth of the Cauvery in Tanjore. The date of this settlement, as deduced by Mr. Nelson/16) is about the tenth century after Christ ; but it is hardly possible, that this could have been the first settlement of Vella lars in one of the earliest seats of Dravidian civiliz ation. 40. Of the various sections above enumerated, C61iars and Kondeikattis are considered to be the (14) P. M. R., pp. 230 and 248. (15) C. B, O. M., Vol. Ill, pp. 386-389 (16) Part II, p. 29."], [215, "181 most ancient. Possibly also, the C61a country was the birthplace of the Vellalars, and the foreign immigrants in other parts of the Tamil country acquired this name from analogy of occupation. Vellalars speak the purest Tamil. 41. Vellalars are exclusively the inhabitants of the Tamil country. In religious observances, they are more strict than the generality of Brahmans ; they abstain from both intoxicating liquors and flesh meat. They are remarkably cleanly in their habits. They do not permit the re-marriage of widows or indulge in polygamy, and they never worship demon gods or village deities. If any classes which call themselves Vellalars follow demonolatry, it may be presumed, they are certainly not true Vellalars. Most of them profess the paiva faith ; but some, ap parently converts to the school of Ramanujacari, are followers of the Vaishnava sect. They do not, how ever, pretend to belong to the Vaisya or any other twice-born caste. They have no sacred thread or the initiation ceremony called \" Upanayanam.\" Their female costume is like that of the ordinary Tamil races. The probable hypothesis with respect to this class is, that the pure Vellalars represent the section of the pre- Aryan or Turanian colonists of the country, who most willingly adopted and most sedulously retain the forms of religion and civilized life introduced by Brahmans. 42. The occupation of the generality of the Vel lalars is agriculture in which they excel all other classes ; but many are found in the various grades of the Government service, more especially as Kar nams or village accountants ; some are engaged in trade. They do not, however, condescend to work of a degrading nature. They carry on agriculture 24"], [216, "182 by \" Panneials\" or predial laborers. AS accountants they are unsurpassed, and the facility with which, in bygone days, they used to write on cadjan or pal myra leaves with iron stiles and pick up information on any given points from a mass of these leaves, by lamplight no less than by daylight, was most re markable. Running by the side of the Tahsildar's palanquin, they could write to dictation and even make arithmetical calculations with the strictest ac- curacy. 43. All the Vellala varieties exist more or less in Tanjore ; but their apparent aggregate has become considerably swollen by the lower classes assuming the title of Pillei and Mudali and calling them selves Vellalars. It is, however, to true Vellalars only, that the description above given of the charac teristic features of the class applies. 44. The Pandarams are Vellala priests. They are, however, only the ordinary spiritual instructors of the class ; the direction of religious ceremonies at births, marriages and deaths devolving on Brahmans of an inferior sacerdotal rank, called \" Panchangi,\" or \" Panchangakkarars.\" Some of the Pandarams are distinguished from the rest by celebacy, and such are called Tambirans ; they wear orange-colored cloths, and allow the hair on their heads to grow into long entangled plaits. In early times, the Tam birans were selected, on account of their being sup posed to be above the temptations of the world, to conduct the superintendence of most of the paiva temples, and continue to this day to do so ; the office devolving after their deaths on disciples of profess edly the same mode of life, elected by them during their lives as heirs apparent. It seems doubtful"], [217, "183 whether during the days of the Hindu Sovereigns, the trusteeship of the temple endowments was vest ed in the Tambirans as it is now ; but whether it was or not, it is only natural to suppose, that some sort of control was exercised over them, and it does not seem unlikely that their private lives were watched also. Now, however, while the power con tinues, all checks over it have ceased and they have it all their own way. 45. The Sa. tanis, as already said, are a class of Satanis. non-Brahmanical priests of the Vaishnava sect. They are said to be the followers of a reformer, called Caitanya, who arose in Orissa about the end of the fifteenth century and preached the doctrine of equality of all races in the eyes of God.(l7) But if this class brought with them, when they came from the north, any such doctrine of universal brotherhood, they have totally abandoned it since their settlement in the south. They constitute here an exclusive caste claiming absolute purity of descent. They respect Brahmans of the Vaishnava sect, quite as much as do all other classes of that sect. According to the Caitanya theory, however, they must have become a mixed class before they came into this country. They abstain from ani mal food ; but do not wear the Brahmanical thread. Their women are dressed exactly like Brahmani women of the Tamil-speaking classes. Satanis every where speak Telugu. They bury their dead. 46. This class consists of eleven principal sub- Kavareis or vadu castes, all speaking Telugu with a large admixture sa'8' of Tamil idioms and all settlers apparently from the Telugu country. These sub-communities generally do not intermarry with one another. The Kavareis (17) Hunter's Orissa, Vol. I, pp. 106 107."], [218, "184 Jettis and Tuluvars. are, as a rule, jealous of the purity of their caste and hold by common consent a place in the scale of castes superior to that of other Ctidra castes, excepting the pure Vellalars and pettis ; they are on the whole a respectable class. 47. The Kavareis are spread more or less over the whole district, and are found in almost every profession. . -As a rule, however, it is only the very poorest of them that work as day laborers ; the great majority are employed eitherinthe lower grades of the Government service orasprivate servants. They are invariably of the Vaishnava persuasion, and are rather intolerant of the piva sect, as are indeed Vel- lalars of that sect of Vaishnavas. The bulk of the Kavarei classes in Tanjore bear the title Nayak ; some that are engaged in trade, more especially those who sell glass bangles, are called pettis, and those who originally settled in agriculture are called Rad- dis. The title of Nayak,'18' like those of Pillei, Mudali and petti, is generally sought after. As a rule, men of the Palli or cooly class, when they enter the Government service as peons or constables, and shep* herds, when they grow rich in trade or otherwise, assume this title, wear the \" Namam,\" (the perpen dicular trident mark on the forehead emblematic of the Vaishnava persuasion), and call themselves Ka vareis or Vadugars, though they cannot speak Telugu, much less point to any part of the Telugu country as the seat of their forefathers. 48. These two classes are wrestlers. Both speak Telugu and wear threads. The Jettis are apparently a Telugu community, and the Tuluvars, as their name implies, are natives of the Tuluva country ; very (IS) A SankriC word which means chief or lord."], [219, "185 probably both came to Tanjore from the Telugu country and the latter forgot their own language during a long residence there and subsequently in the Tamil country. These two classes are considered to be of superior castes and strictly maintain their individualities, never intermarrying among any but their own exclusive communities. They never de scend to any degrading work. They are very faith ful to their masters, and during the days of the Rajas were employed exclusively in guarding the Treasury and Jewel rooms. Since the death of the late Raja, most of them have emigrated to Mysore and other native states, and but a small proportion now remain in Tanjore. They reside exclusively in the fort of Tanjore. 49. The main divisions of the weaver classes in Tanjore are : \u2014 Weaver classea 1. Pattunulkarars or 2. paliyars. silk weavers. 3. Keikkalars. 4. p_niars. 5. pedars. 6. Kannadiyars. 50.

The principal seats of weaver classes in the district. Kammalars (Arti- sans.) people. They rank however, by common consent, among the higher castes. 51. The Caliyars profess the paiva faith and are clearly aborigines of the country. They generally abstain from animal food. They are, on the whole, as cleanly and respectable looking as pure Vellalars, though they are considered to be the lowest of the weaver classes. 52. Keikkalars are a composite class sub-divided into clans, some professing the paiva, some Lingayet and others Vaishnava religion ; all speaking Tamil. peniars are divided into Vaishnavas and Lingayets and speak Telugu. This description also applies verbatim to pedars; it applies equally to Kannadiyars with the exception that they speak Kanarese instead. The sub-divisions of each class intermarry. The symbolic forehead mark of both the paiva and Lingayet persuasions is \" Vibhuti\" (sacred ashes), and that of the Vaishnava \" Namam.\" The Lingayet section of each of these communities (Keikkalars, peniars, Cedars and Kannadiyars) bury, while the Vaishnava and paiva sections of Keikkalars burn, their dead. All these classes, with the exception of the Lingayet priests, eat flesh meat and drink ardent spirits. 53. The Pattunulkarars have settled in only three towns inthis district, viz., Tanjore, Alyamp-ttei, a town about 9 miles north-east from Tanjore, and Combaconum ; but in each of these places, they are a numerous body. The other weaver classes are spread more or less over the whole district. 54. \"Kammalar\" is a Tamil compound derived from the Sanscrit \" Karma\" (work) corrupted into"], [221, "187 \" Kam;\" the suffix \" Alan\" (literally one who rules or wields) signifying here, as in other similar com pounds, the exercise of a craft or a privilege. The Kammala or Artisan class, corresponding to the Sanskrit \" Pancala,\" is divided into five distinct com munities, working different materials, thus: \u2014 1. Tattan, Gold and Silver Smith. 2. Kannan, Brass and Copper Smith. 3. Kollan, Iron Smith. 4. Taccan, Carpenter. 5. Kaltaccan, Stone Mason. 55. The first sub-caste or community is sub divided into three minor sections : \u2014 (1.) Those who make gold and silver orna- ments generally. These are designated by the general name \" Tattan.\" (2.) Those who' do exclusively the work of setting precious stones in gold and generally make all ornaments of which precious stones form a constituent part. These are called \" Kondanakkarars.\" \" Kondan,\" which means fixing jewels in metal, is a Hindi or Persian word, and is not to be found in the Tamil vocabulary, and it is clear, therefore, that the name of this section of artisans, as well as the particular art itself, was introduced from the Dakhan or Northern India. (3.) Those who make silver vessels and all other articles of silver not worn as ornaments. These are called Vellik-"], [222, "188 kannar or Silver Smiths. The last section \" Kaltaccar,\" or stone ma sons, is subdivided into two minor sections, viz., the Kaltaccar proper who merely hew stones and pirpans (Sanskrit \" pilpa\") who are sculptors. The latter generally cast metal images also. 56. In religious persuasion, the Kammalars, like weaver classes, are divided into three sects, viz., Lingayet, Caiva and Vaishnava ; but those pro fessing the Vaishnava faith are comparatively very few. The difference of persuasion is no bar to inter marriage among Tamil Kammalars. A small com munity of goldsmiths called \" Vaduga Kammalars,\" speak Telugu, and are apparently colonists from the Telugu country ; all the rest speak Tamil. The \" Vaduga Kammalars\" probably do not intermarry with the Tamil-speaking Kammalars. All Kamma lars wear threads, and in the large towns of Tanjore, Combaconum and Negapatam, where they are con gregated in large communities, have their own priests to officiate at marriages and funerals ; everywhere else in the district, they call in Brahmans. No where in Tanjore do they deny the authority of Brahmans nor refuse to salute them with \" Namas kar.\" In the large towns above named, the Kam malars have their own temples ; but they employ Brahmans to officiate or carry on the daily service in them. 57. The artisan class must rise in importance as popular wants multiply and tastes refine. Accord ingly, under the influence of assured peace and general progress during the last three-quarters of a"], [223, "189 Vaniyar and Ilei vaniyar. century of British rule, and with the remunerative employment which Railways and other public works afford them, the condition of the Kammalar class has very considerably improved and is now all that can be desired. 58. The Kammalars are as a class untruthful and unreliable. Punctuality is a virtue absolutely foreign to their nature. From unwillingness to let work go to others, each undertakes a great deal more than he can do within anything like the time agreed on, and so his customers are one and all equally disappointed and disgusted. As to honesty, no one counts upon absolute security from adul teration in the materials entrusted to gold and silver smiths. To tamper with them is regarded as a privilege ; an accusation gives no offence and discovery causes no blushing. They are as callous to imputations of dishonesty in their trade, as they are sensitive to attacks on their caste privileges. Expressions of suspicion or distrust are received merely as a compliment to their skill in their craft. It must, however, I think, be in justice stated, that wholesale swindling is no part of the general charac ter of Kammalars, as indeed of native craftsmen generally. Their pilfering is restricted generally to a percentage, varying of course according to the degree of vigilance exercised over them, but ordi narily not exceeding 5 per cent. 59. These are two classes of oilmongers who bear the title petti, but are considered to be of alow caste. They express oils from various vegetable seeds as well as deal in them. The oils expressed and sold by these classes exclusively are : \u2014 Gingelly \u2014 Sesamum orientale. Cocoanut \u2014 Cocos nucifera. 2o"], [224, "190 Iluppei \u2014 Bassia longifolia. Pinnei \u2014 Calophyllum Inophyllum, and Groundnut \u2014 Arachis hypogoa. According to the pastras, the crushing of gingelly seeds and the sale of gingelly oil are sinful acts, and as these acts constitute an essential part of the oil monger's occupation, he is considered to be on that account of a low caste. No one who does not belong to the Vaniyan or oilmonger caste will either express or sell gingelly oil. The oilmonger castes have latter ly entered upon other trades and are a flourishing class.

Probably, it is in the form, \" ahamudeiyan,\" signifying house-holder or land holder, that the term applies more correctly to the class to which it is applied indiscriminately in both forms. The people of this class are found chiefly in the southern taluks of the district. 62. The word \" Muppar\" is derived from \" Muppu,\" superiority or surveyorship, and hence means one who presides over herdsmen or ploughmen. This particular class, however, now no longer appears in its pastoral, and is seen only in its agricultural, character ; it is found chiefly in the Combaconum taluk. 63. This word is derived from \" Nattam\" (vil lage) and is used in three various forms \" Natta makkal,\" \" Nattamar\" and \" Nattamadi ;\" all mean ing the same thing, i. e ., husbandmen or farmers. The honorific title of this class is \" Udeiyar.\" This class is the most numerous in the southern and upland parts of the district. 64. This word is apparently a corruption of \" Padeiyalan,\" derived from \"Padei\" (army); with the usual suffix, \" alan,\" it means a warrior. The Padeiyaccis muster strongly in the more northern and eastern parts of the delta. 65.

This word is derived from Valei (net). Va- Vaieiyar leiyars are inhabitants of the country inland and live by snaring birds and fishing in fresh waters ; they engage also in agricultural labor as well as in general cooly work such as carrying loads, husking paddy and cutting and selling firewood. Valeiyars are not considered an out-caste like the fishermen class on the coast. They are found chiefly in the more southern and south-western parts of the district and are a poor degraded class. It does not appear what \" Kamblattar\" under which name 6,843 persons are entered in the census tables, compiled at Madras, means. The name is applied in Tanjore to a certain tribe of mendicants, who occasionally visit this country from the west ward, and are supposed to be skilled in sorcery. 69. Ahamudeiyars, Muppars and Nattamadis, The characteristics . . . . of the various classes more especially the last, are industrious, quiet and Ahamudeiyars, well-conducted people. A considerable proportion m|d_ai' of Nattamadis are converts to the Roman Catholic religion, and in the Vallam neighbourhood, there are very few of this class who profess any other faith. 70. So far as can be ascertained, there is no ac- Padeiyaccis f Kallars. count of the Padeiyacci class on record anywhere. Of Kallars, all the information obtainable from Ward's Survey account and other available documents, with much of a romantic character regarding their manners and customs, will be found in Mr. Nelson's Manual of Madura. The Kallar inhabitants of Tanjore, how ever, present hardly any social phenomena of a strik ing nature. The fact is, that this district is the most advanced in aryan civilization in the south and presents therefore very few features of primitive aboriginal life. Wholly different from the barbarian"], [228, "194 Lawless habits of Kallars and Padei yaccis. inhabitants of the Mela Nadu and Kila Nadu in Madura are the Kallar ryots who inhabit the villages along the banks of the Cauvery. In their dress and external appearance generally, they look quite like Vellalars. Nothing is known in Tanjore of the custom of a woman being the wife of six, eight or ten husbands, all held to be the fathers jointly and severally of any children that may be born of her body, nor of the practice, in the case of a quarrel between two women, of the one who thinks herself injured or insulted killing her child at the door of her ag gressor, in order to avenge herself by compelling the latter to kill her child by way of reparation.'19' 71. Some of the less romantic and inoffensive characteristics as they are described of the Kallar class in Madura and Tinnevelly are found among the recent immigrants of that caste from countries to the south, who are distinguished from the older Kallar colonies by the general term \" Ter kattiyar,\" literally southerns, which includes also emigrants of other castes from the south. The \" Terkattiyars\" are found chiefly in those parts of the district which border on Pudukdttei ; small colonies of them are met with also in parts of the delta. Kallars of this group grow their hair long all over the head exactly like women, and both men and women enlarge the holes in the lobes of their ears to an extraordinary size by inserting rolls of palm leaf into them. 72. In former days, robbery in gangs with open violence and stealing by burglary were the professed callings of not only Kallars but also of Padeiyaccis, and, with a considerable proportion of both, still continue to be so. The Menkavalgarars or overseer- (19) M. M., Part II., pp. 52 and 51."], [229, "195 watchers, so well known in the history of the Police administration of the country, were chiefly of these two classes. There is not a man in Tanjore who has not heard of Anakkudi Arunacala Padeiyacci, the leader of a gang of dacoits, who, after a long and desperate predatory career, broken by intervals of in carceration in jail, was at last transported for life in 1858. Now, however, profitable agriculture, coupled with security of property in land, has converted tho great bulk of the Kallar and Padeiyacci classes into a contented as well as industrious population. They are now too fully occupied with agriculture and the incidental litigation to think of their old lawless pursuits, even if they had an inclination to follow them. The bulk of the Ryotwari proprietors in that richly cultivated part of the Cauvery delta, which constituted the greater portion of the old taluk of Tiruvadi, are Kallars, and, as a rule, they are a wealthy and wr ell-to-do class. They are generally very troublesome neighbours otherwise. 73. The \" Ideiyars\" are cowherds and shepherds, ideiyar. and the derivation of the name has not been satis factorily ascertained. The Rev. Mr. Pope, in a note in his edition of Abbe Dubois' well-known work on the manners and customs of natives, says that the Ideir are so called from \" idei\", middle; being a kind of intermediate link between the farmers and mer chants.\" Mr. Nelson considers this derivation to be fanciful and thinks that \"perhaps they are so called from originally inhabiting (as the Natives say they did) the lands which lay midway between the hills and the arable lands, the jungly plains, suited for pasturage.\"*^20' It is difficult to say how much nearer the mark this latter conjecture may be. (20) (M. M., Part II, p. 60)"], [230, "196 74. This class, like most others, consists of several clans; but they may be broadly divided into two sections, the one more thoroughly aryan ized and the other retaining most of the essential characteristics of an aboriginal race. Those belong ing to the first class follow the Vaishnava sect; wear the \" namam\" like the Sri Vaishnava Brahmans and the Kavareis, and call themselves Yadavas; they in all respects follow the Aryan customs. Those belonging to the second section stick to their demon worship, make no pretensions to a descent from the Yadava race and have in fact no idea of an ancestry associated with Yadava or Krishna. This latter section of herdsmen, like all other aboriginal tribes, daub their foreheads with the sacred cowdung ashes, and are regarded, ap parently from this circumstance alone, to belong to the paiva sect. 75- The so-called Yadava race probably belong to the early immigrations from the north, of which Colonel Wilks speaks at the opening of the second chapter of his South India ; but their pretensions to Yadava origin are clearly the result of a confusion of ideas. Herdsmen and milk-maids were no doubt associates of Krishna in his youth at Madhura (Muttra) on the banks of the Yamuna (Jumna) ; but they clearly do not belong on that account to the royal race of Yadavas, a collateral branch of the great Lunar dynasty, in which Krishna was born. Taking these self-styled Yadavas to be colonists, as they may well be, from northern India ; from their having so thoroughly adopted the language of the country where they are settled, it is presumable that they immigrated at a very early date. There is no reason, however, for supposing that these herdsmen"], [231, "197 Kusavur, Potters Vannar, Washermen, Ambuttar, Barbers. tribes brought with them any larger share of Aryan blood than is contained in the general mass of the ordinary pudra population of the north ; they pro bably had none when they left Aryavart ; if indeed they came from those regions. They, however, never descend to any degrading work. Their occupa tion as herdsmen is confined to tending and milking cows and buff alos as well as dealing in milk, butter and buttermilk, and they do not tend or otherwise deal with sheep or goats. As already stated, these herds men, as they grow rich, enter upon trade or agricul ture, and on the whole, they are without doubt a respectable class. The relative proportion of these to the whole herdsmen class, however, is very small, their aggregate number according to the last census \u2014 being only 4,826 against 60,915 of the aboriginal Ideiyars. They are found chiefly in larger towns. 7Q. These castes are so well known and are so much the same everywhere in the south, that no de tailed account of them seems necessary. The order in which they are placed indicates the relative low estimation in which their callings are held. The barbers are not allowed to enter the house of a Brah man or a Vellala, and in the rural parts of the dis trict, washermen are similarly excluded ; cloths wash ed by them not being worn or mixed up with other cloths in the house before they have undergone another wash by a caste man. As a rule, barbers practice medicine, and when they become successful in this honorable occupation, they totally cease to be barbers ; their women are invariably midwives for all castes. On the whole, however, both these classes (barbers and washermen) are held in more degradation in the Tamil than in the Telugu country. In some places, barbers and washermen hold equal positions and also intermarry. 26"], [232, "198 Tadan and Andi, 77. These two are mendicant classes respectively of the Vaishnava and paiva sects. \" Tadan\" is the corruption of the Sanskrit, \" Dasa,\" which, with the Tamil termination \"an\" stands as \" Dasan ;\" the word is often used in this original form, but oftener as Dasari. This word is invariably applied to Vaishnava mendicants. Andi is a pure Tamil word of which the exact root is not known ; in its ordinary acceptation, it means houseless beggars, and is applied exclusively to those who profess the paiva faith. Both the classes go out every morning begging for alms of uncooked rice, singing ballads or hymns. The Tadans play on a small drum with their fingers, ancl Andis on a small gong called \" pemakkalam\" with a stick ; both often carry a conch which they blow occasionally. This particu lar kind of religious mendicancy is followed by these two classes alone as their exclusive calling which, like almost every other calling, passes by inheritance from father to son. Both these classes are given to drinking, but Tadans are more quiet and orderly than Andis. Men of other castes who from poverty or laziness live by begging in the ordinary way, using only importunities and moaning, are not includ ed in these two classes. Meiakkarajati, i.e., 78. This is a composite class made up of dancing dancing women and . . -,- \u2022 \u2022 , other musicians. women and male musicians distinguished by a mark- ed social division from the higher order of musical profession. To the latter (exclusively male) belong persons of Brahmanical and other higher castes, who cultivate and practise music by taste as well as those who make it a profession and earn a livelihood by it ; they constitute no distinct caste. The danc ing women and such of the other musical performers of the Melakkara caste as together form a complete chorus constitute what is called \" pinnam-lam\""], [233, "199 (smaller music) in distinction from \" Periyamelam\" (big music) which is the band of musicians (all males) who play upon the native clarionet called \" Na gasaram\" with a big drum and other accompaniments of a different kind from those of the dancers. In the town of Tanjore, the Telugu-speaking bar bers practise music of the Periyamelam kind; but they are an exceptional class. 79. The daughters of dancing women are invari ably brought up to the mother's profession, and those of the males of their troupe, who have their own married wives, are also more or less so brought up ; it is only occasionally, that the ranks of dancing women are recruited by purchase of young girls ; but it is invariably from the scum of the population that they are thus recruited. Ordinarily, no family, how ever low in the scale of castes, (the Melakkara caste excepted) will agree to a daughter being brought up as a dancing girl ; but those of the lowest classes above the grade of Pareiyas, when pinched by want, sell their daughters for the purpose. The male per formers generally intermarry amongst their own community. 80. Besides the class of dancing women and mu- Kammaia dancing . - -l-ii -I--I11 women aud Kuttadia sicians above described, there are two km area classes, 0r vagaboud dancers. which require to be noticed. They are \" Kammaia Tevadiyal,\" or the dancing women of the Kammaia or artisan caste, and Kuttadis, a class which, as de scribed by Mr. Nelson in his Madura Manual, com prehends vagabond dancers, pantomimists, actors and marionette exhibitors, &c. The Kammalans are obliged to have dancing women of their own ; because, owing to the low estimate in which their caste is held, the ordinary dancing women and mu-"], [234, "200 Jaugama. J aum sicians will not perform in their houses or before an assembly of their caste. The \" Kuttadis\" belong to the beggar class and hold a very low position in social scale. They go about begging to be allowed to perform and always perform in public streets and bazaars; they are not allowed to enter a family house or temple or at all a place where respectable people assemble. 81 . In the Census tables, 5388 persons are entered as Jangama or Lingayet, and these are presumably exclusive of those comprised in the Kammaia and weaver castes. These extra Lingayets pursue other callings; the only distinguishing feature of this caste being the particular creed they profess. They apparently intermarry with the castes to which they would belong \"but for their particular religion. 82. According to the last Census there are only 1,607 Jains; these are scattered over the different parts of the district. They are engaged partly in trade and partly in agriculture. They are generally a well-to-do class and some very rich. The rules of conduct enjoined by the Jaina religion are so well known, that any detailed description of them here seems altogether unnecessary. The Jainas most scrupulously avoid the killing of animals and abstain from flesh meat and fish. Another rule which they more or less scrupulously maintain is not to eat or drink after nightfall ; the object being apparently to avoid their unwittingly swallowing some minute worm or insect with their food or drink. The Jainas in Tanjore show no intolerance or hostility to the Hindu religion ; on the contrary the more wealthy of them extend their patronage alike to Brahmans and the Brahmanical temples."], [235, "201 83. Under this head come the five castes, i. e., Castes considered g~,, , tti _\\ -i n -_- inferior to Cudras panars, Jbishermen, Uddars, Kuravars and Tombars ; and superior to all held in about the same degree of exclusion, none (pS_.yaScuitiVa.ora* of them being allowed to enter the houses of caste \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3_ _3E_ people, temples or choultries. 84. The profession of panars is to draw toddy C___s. from palm trees and to sell it. They are divided into three minor divisions, i. e., Tennanjanars, Pa nanjanars and Icanjanars; the prefix in each case denoting the kind of trees from which they draw toddy, i.e., Tennei \u2014 Cocoanut ; Panei \u2014 Palmyra; and Iccu \u2014 ph\u0153nix parinifera, which grows wild. The division refers merely to occupation and indicates no social distinction. So far as the panars in Tanjore are concerned, it is not correct to say that they are a palm-cultivating caste ; for they do not, as in Tin nevelly, own plantations of palmyra or any other palm trees, or themselves cultivate them. It is only the drawing and selling of toddy that constitutes their exclusive occupation. The cultivation of trees is not restricted to this or any other caste, but forms a part of the ordinary cooly work devolving on labor ing classes. 85. The fishermen are divided into three different Fishermen sections : Kareiyar, pembadavar, and Pattanavar. \" Kareiyan\" means he who lives on the shore (karei), and is intended probably to denote a class of colo nists who, coming by sea, occupied the sand hills on the sea shore. The etymology of the names of the two other sections is not clear. Kareiyars are also boatmen, and all the three classes live on the coast fishing in the sea. 86. The three last classes : Oddars, Kuravars oddars, Kuravara . and Tombars. and Tombars, form no part of the fixed population"], [236, "202 The Pareiya or out-caste tribes. Divisions of the Pareiya or out-caste tribes. of the district except that a few families live in huts in small clusters in parts of the district. These three classes belong apparently to a prior colony driven into jungles and mountain fastnesses by the Turanian settlers who constitute the bulk of the present population. Apparently, these classes do not affect any religious persuasion. The Oddars are the class known elsewhere as tank-diggers ; but there are very few of them in Tanjore. The Kura vars are generally beggars and thieves ; some of them traffic in salt, keeping herds of donkeys, sometimes bullocks, for the conveyance of the commodity, which they carry from the coast hawking from place to place. They also sometimes carry grain from inland towns to the coast where they barter it for salt. Tombars are a class allied to Kuravars and are distinguishable from them only by their pursuing the calling of weaving baskets and mats of bamboos, rushes, &c. 87. The word \" Pareiyan\" is generally supposed to be derived from \" Parei,\" a drum, from its having been originally the occupation of this class to beat drums.*21) The status of the entire class is the same in Tanjore as in other parts of the south. Its original condition was servitude of which, however, no ves tige now remains. The complete exclusion and degradation of the class is a problem which has not yet been satisfactorily solved. 88. The Pareiya or out-caste tribes consist of three distinct divisions, viz., Pareiya proper, pekkili and Palla. Dr. Caldwell objects to Pareiyas \" who constitute a well-defined, distinct, ancient caste,\" with sub-divisions of its own, being called \"out castes;\" but it is not easy to find a more appropriate (21) Pope's Abbe Dubois on the Manners and Customs of the people of India. Note, p. 328 ; also C C G. D. h., p. 498."], [237, "203 Pareiyas proper Their occupation, term to distinguish this totally isolated class from the rest of the population. It is somewhat difficult to conceive a caste system in India which claims to be independent of the Brahmanical religious theory, and considered in their relation to the fourfold system of Hindu castes, it does not seem how else the Pareiyas, as an Indian community, can be desig nated. 89. Pareiyas proper are divided into numerous minor groups which, as observed by Mr. Nelson, \" it would be a thankless task to enumerate and describe with accuracy.\" They have their own spiritual pastors called Valluvars. They have their own washermen and their own barbers. They have also their own musicians of the \" Periyamelam\" class (see para. 86 ante) to perform on occasions of marriages among them. One of the Pareiya groups requires to be specially noticed on account of its being distinguished from the rest by a custom apparently borrowed from caste tribes. It is called \" Aruttu Kattada.\" Among this group, widows are not allowed to re-marry, \u2014 a practice whence they derive their name, signifying those who, having once cut, do not tie again, (the Tali or the marriage emblem being implied). 90. In Tanjore, Pareiyas are employed chiefly as agricultural laborers ; the various other occupa tions they follow are : \u2014 (1) The beating of tom-toms and blowing of horns. (2) Grooming horses. (3) Making baskets of bamboo, rushes, &c. (4) Spinning cotton and weaving coarse cloths."], [238, "204 Cekkiliyars and their occupation. Pallars and their ooonpations. (5) Watching grain on threshing floors and generally pursuing the office of Talayari or village watcher. (6) The T6ti or scavengering work. 91. Cekkiliyars are shoe-makers, leather dress ers and tanners. They are considered to be of the very lowest status. In some parts of the district the pekkiliyars speak Telugu and wear Namam ; they are apparently immigrants from the Telugu country. Their women are reputed to be very licen tious in their lives. 92. The word \" Pallan\" is probably derived, as Mr. Nelson thinks, from \" Pallam,\" a pit or low lying ground ; as it is possible that originally such ground was allotted for their residence. The Palla and Pareiya are rival castes, each claiming superiority over the other, and a deadly and never-ending conflict in the matter of caste privileges exists between them. Pallars are peculiar to the dis tricts on the east coast south of the Coleroon, and it does not appear that a corresponding class exists anywhere else. They are pr\u00e6dial laborers and are employed exclusively in the cultivation of paddy lands. Their women are considered to be particularly skilled in planting and weeding, and in most parts of the delta they alone are employed in these operations. Pallars will neither join nor will be allowed to join the Pareiya class under any cir cumstances. They have everywhere a separate spot allotted to them for residence, which is called \" Pal lacC-ri\" in distinction from that occupied by the Pareiya class which is called \" Paracceri.\" The Pallars do not eat the flesh of cows or oxen. The marriage bond is very loose among them ; their women may change their husbands at will and un-"], [239, "205 chastity is held to be a matter of very little con sequence. The Palla women expose their body above the waist, a distinctive mark of their primitive condition of slavery, of which, however, no trace now exists. 93. Taking all the Pareiya or outcaste tribes together, their manners and customs may be briefly summed up thus :\u2014 They are pure devil- worshippers, though they are classed as paivas or Vaishnavas, according as they wear ashes or Namam. With the exception of the minor section called \" Aruttu Kat tada,\" all Pareiya classes allow their widows to remarry ; and excepting Pallars and Cekkiliyars and perhaps also one or two more minor sections, all guard the chastity of their married women as jea lously as do caste people. Indeed, among the higher sections, as they are called, of the Pareiyas, a mar ried woman guilty of a proved act of adultery is doomed to perpetual concubinage or single life ; so is also an unmarried woman whose virginity has been violated or who has been guilty of a single act of incontinence. The Pareiya and pekkili classes have no scruple to kill cows or oxen or to eat beef, though practically they content themselves with eating the flesh of dead cattle, as cows and oxen are never killed in this district otherwise than by stealth. All the various sections of this composite class, ex cepting such as have embraced Christianity, ordina rily burn their dead ; it is only when the cause of death has been cholera, small-pox or other infectious disease, or when they cannot afford the requisite fuel, that they bury them. 94. The general character of the Pareiya class is so well known and has been so minutely described by writers on Indian subjects, that it seems unneces- 27"], [240, "206 sary to enter into any detailed description of it. As a class they have no loathing for filth ; if they have no scruple to kill cows or oxen or to eat their flesh, it is surely not because they hold enlightened views in matters of religion and regard the prohibition of the practice as a superstition. The fact is, they have no idea of either religion or superstition. They have a contempt alike for both, and it is their privilege to do what is considered most abominable. Love of intoxicating drinks is another predominant feature of their character ; but one cannot find among the Pallars or Pareiyas of Tanjore anything like the amount of drunkenness which is observable in the Madras neighbourhood. Further, this vice is restrict- ed in Tanjore almost exclusively to men. The main characteristic of their women is quarrelling, and it is impossible to conceive a scene more revolting to decency than a quarrel between two women or two parties of women of the Pareiya, more especially of the pekkili, caste. It must be stated, however, in justice to the Pareiyas and Pallars that they are a patient and industrious class and generality faithful to their masters. They rarely commit open rob- beries, and their thefts are restricted generally to their immediate wants."], [241, "207 Religious persua sions of the people. PART II. CHAPTER IV. RELIGIOUS PERSUASIONS OF THE PEOPLE ; THEIR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS; DRESS, FOOD, DRINK, SPORTS, AND FESTIVALS. 1. Tanjore, as is well known, is one of the chief seats of the Brahmanical religion. It never came under direct Mahomedan sway, but retained its native rule more or less uninterruptedly till the beginning of the present century. Further, during the past three-quarters of a century of British rule, it has in common with the rest of India enjoyed, in addition to the blessings of peace, a degree of religious toler ance and protection for its natural creed such as has perhaps nowhere in the history of the world fallen to the lot of a conquered race. As might be expect ed, therefore, in the words of Walter Hamilton, \" the Hindu religion has been preserved (here) in con siderable splendor, and their (Hindu's) ancient places of worship, with their vast endowments, remain un touched.\"^) 2. The solicitude evinced by the native rulers for the preservation of their religious institutions may be gathered from the conditions on which they per mitted the formation of European Settlements on the Coast. The grants by which the Mahratta Ra jas, in the years 1739 and 1742, put the port of Kareikkal and the adjoining villages in the posses sion of the French, contain among others a condition thus : \u2014 \" With regard to the Pagodas in Carrical and vil lages aforesaid, you are to pay their allowances ac- (1) A Geographical, Statistical and Historical description of Hindustan (Vol II, page 153)."], [242, "208 cording to Salabad custom and take care that their worship and the celebration of the feast of Rado chevam may be performed with due respect ; and you are likewise to continue the duties appropriated for their use, according to the usual customs. You are not to convert the Bramin's houses into those of the Pandaravada or the Soodra caste. As there are several tanks in the Pagodas and at the Bramin's houses, you must not suffer the Europeans to go into them.\"<2> 3. In their instructions to Major Vaughan, re lative to the occupation of the fort of Vallam, dated 9th December 1771, the Madras Presidency say : \u2014 \" Nothing can more effectually reconcile them (Gentus) to our Government than an apparent desire in us to avoid everything that may give offence in matters which they deem sacred, and as the killing of bullocks is expressly forbidden by their religion, we would particularly recommend that none be suff ered to be killed for the use of the garrison. The Navab has promised that you shall be fully supplied with sheep and other provisions. \"(3) 4. According to the last census, out of the entire population of the district, the Hindus make up 91 \"4 per cent.'4) As everywhere else, the two main divi sions of the Hindus are paivas and Vaishnavas ; but in Tanjore the great majority are paivas.

The leading principles of the different forms of the Brahmanical religion are so well known and have been so fully described by competent oriental ists, that it seems needless to say any thing on the subject here. Indeed, it may be doubted whether an official publication is the proper place for disser - tations on the theories of religious beliefs. These, however, so far as they bear on the social relations of the people, can be best gathered from the descrip tion which is given of their manners and customs. 6. In the preceding chapter, the special charac teristics of the various Hindu castes have been indi cated. It may be generally stated as regards all castes (the Pareiyas or out-castes of course excepted), that the killing of cows and the eating of beef is strictly prohibited, and that, with the undermen tioned exceptions, all burn their dead. The except ed cases in which the dead are buried are : \u2014 (1) All classes which profess the Jangama or Lingayet form of faith. (2) Satanis or Vaishnava priests of the Cddra caste. (3) Among other classes of Hindus, San- nyasis or ascetics. (4) Young children. 7. Demonolatry and widow-marriage are the two characteristics which perhaps may be regarded to indicate an imperfectly Aryanized state of a com munity ; but it is difficult to draw a precise line. In"], [244, "210 Widow marriage Tanjore there are hardly any classes, other than Christian and Mahomedan, which do not affect more or less the Aryanized forms of idolatry, though the lower classes maintain at the same time, with greater or less pertinacity, also their primitive faith, i. e., worship of evil spirits. The castes, whose professed creed does not recognize demon gods, are : \u2014 1. Rajaputs. 2. Mahrattas. 3. Rachevars. 4. Kdmatis. 5. True pettis other than Kdmatis. 6. True Vellalars. 7. Satanis. 8. Kavarei or Vadugars. 9. Jettis or Wrestlers. 10. Weaver classes. 11. Kammalars or Artisan classes. 12. Andis or mendicants of the paiva sect. 13. Tadars do. of the Vaishnava sect. 14. Melakkarars or Musicians. 15. Jangamas or Lingayets. 16. Jains. 8. As to widow marriage, all who aspire to a higher status in the social scale, affect to eschew and generally eschew it. Even among Kallars, those who have become large and wealthy land-holders do not permit their widows to remarry. None of the castes enumerated under the pre ceding head, with the exception of Ceniyars among the weaver class, allow their widows to remarry. Monogamy is the general rule, but among pudra castes, the more wealthy often marry two wives. Similar instances among Brahmans are very excep tional, and it is only when there is a total absence of"], [245, "211 all prospect of issue by a first wife, that a second wife is taken. The marrying of a second wife after the death of the first is among all classes very com mon. Polyandry is unknown in this district. The rules and restrictions which regulate intermarriages have been indicated under the head of Castes. 9. A minute description of the details of the Domestic life. domestic life of a Hindu would far exceed the rea sonable limits of an official compilation, and it would after all be in great part a mere repetition of what has already appeared in other similar compilations. A brief notice, therefore, of its leading characteristics and of those traits which distinguish the people of this district from those of other parts of the country seems to be all that is needed. It may be generally stated at the outset, that the tendency among all classes is to adopt the customs, social as well as reli gious, of Brahmans ; whilst among Brahmans them- \u00ab. selves (women excepted) it is towards degeneracy. 10. Married life commands universal respect and Respectability at. . .-it , -i \u2022 , <\u2022 i tached to married is the dearest object ot every one, man and woman life. alike. Concubinage is held in such disrepute, that it is rarely openly indulged in except by the classes which rank very low in the social scale. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive a greater outrage to an ordina rily respectable Hindu family than to introduce a prostitute into the house, and if a husband attempted to do so, the wife would ordinarily throw herself into a well. 11. On the whole, a propensity to lavish spend- Propensity for ing is a distinguishing trait in the character of the people of this district. Tanjore is no doubt more wealthy than most other districts ; but no one who has observed the modes of life of the natives in diff- erent parts of the south can have failed to note"], [246, "212 Dress Its cost Food. that the people of this district spend more on dress, food and furniture, as well as on charity than those possessing a corresponding measure of competence elsewhere. 12. Jackets and coats are not in fashion among even the higher ranks excepting the official classes. The ordinary dress of a man in the upper classes consists of a long piece, worn round the body below the waist and a shorter one thrown over the shoulders, a head cloth and a handkerchief. The number of such suits which a man would require and their cost vary with the tastes as well as the relative means of individuals. Altogether, a man's dress will cost about Rs. 40 a year, and besides this, he has to make presents. The dress of a woman con sists of a long piece of cloth interlaced with silk and gold or silver threads and a choli or half jacket. Of the former, the greater portion encircles the body below the waist and the remainder is brought over it to the neck. The chdli forms an essential part of the woman's dress among Mahrattas and the upper ranks of the Telugu nation (widows excepted in both cases) ; but it is now coming into fashion among all upper classes, excepting only elderly women of the Brahman and higher pddra castes of the Tamil nationality, who still eschew the wearing of chdlis as becoming only little girls. Among the upper classes, a women's garments cost about Rs. 70 in the year. In either case, however, the rate given represents only the cost of the ordinary costume. Considerable amounts of money are spent on garments kept for occasional wear at festivals, marriage occasions and the like. 13. As observed by Mr. Nelson, \"the wealthy classes eat much the same kinds of food as the middle,"], [247, "213 Its cost but of course have them prepared more richly and tastily. \"f5) Rice is the food of all classes with the only exception that in parts of the district, where dry grains are grown, they to some extent supplement the food of the laboring classes ; the produce of dry grains in Tanjore, however, is on the whole very limited. Dholl, ghee, vegetable oils, butter-milk and spices enter largely into the food of the upper classes. Ulundu pulse (Phasealus, Radiatus) enters in small proportions in many of the articles of ordinary meal, and is essentialfor most of the common cakes. The spices more generally used by them are pepper, mustard, cumin seed, coriander, fenugreek, tur meric and assafoetida ; tender plants of coriander and bergera k\u0153nigii are also essential. The varieties of vegetables are almost innumerable ; those in general use are green plantains, brinjals, cucumbers, snake cucumbers (Trichosanthes anguina), Murungei sticks (Moringa pterygosperma), green chillies, unripe mangoes, limes, cocoanuts, and the various kinds of peas, roots and greens. Pickles or unripe fruits pre served in salt, of which there is a great variety, are an essential part of the daily meal. The fruits most commonly used for this purpose are unripe mangoes and country citrons or oranges and limes. Salt, tamarind and dry chillies are of course the most indis pensable ingredients of food among all, rich and poor. Sugar does not enter into the ordinary daily meal of the native ; it is a necessary ingredient of only particular cakes which are made only on festival days. 14. The actual cost of food to a native is, like their dress, generally underrated. It is true that wines form no part of their dinners and that flesh (5) M. M., Part II, page 17. 28"], [248, "214 U\u00abe of alcohol meat is sparingly used even by those who are not restrained from its use by their creed. But ghee, vegetable oils, milk and butter-milk are not very cheap articles. Further, among natives, servants take their meals in the masters' houses and partake of much the same fare as their masters, and there are moreover generally one or two guests often accompanied by their own servants. The waste out of what is served on the plantain leaf, which is the ordinary plate to eat from, is not small. The expenditure of firewood is considerable, as all cooking is done in the house, and tepid baths which are the general rule among the upper classes require no small quantity of water to be boiled or heated daily. On the whole, among the upper classes, the bare cost of meals is not much below Rs. 10 per head per mensem. The cost of the food of the lower classes, like that of their costume, varies with their earnings ; it will be noticed more fully under the head of wages of labor. 15. The use of alcoholic or intoxicating drinks is by no means so common as it is supposed to be. As a rule, the only classes habitually addicted to it are : \u2014 1. Pareiyas. 2. Artisans, i. e., who work metals. 3. Musicians of the Periyamelam class. 4. Certain classes of weavers. 5. Tailors, a low class of Mahrattas of the pudra caste. 6. Certain exceptional communities of Brahmans."], [249, "215 Disposition to charity. Those who, subject to exceptions to which every rule is subject, religiously abstain from this indulgence are : \u2014 1. Brahmans other than those excepted. 2. True Vellalars, more especially Pan- darams. 3. True pettis. 4. Kdmatis. 5. Mahomedans of the Labbe\" class. Even among the ordinary laboring classes of pddras, many do not touch alcoholic drinks. Toddy is the universal drink of Pareiyas and such of the other laboring classes as are given to habits of in toxication, and all higher classes drink arrack or French brandies. Opium is hardly ever used other wise than as a medicine. Gan j a or hemp which was in common use among the lower classes of Mah rattas, more especially tailors, has now been almost wholly displaced by arrack and toddy. 16. Much money is no doubt squandered in liti gation as well as in dissipation and frivolities, but much is spent at the same time in charity, secular as well as religious, and nowhere is the disposition to build chattrams so conspicuous as in Tanjore. It will be seen from the chapter on native religious and charitable institutions, that out of 694 chattrams(6) which existed in the district in the early part of 1873, no less than 661 had been built by private individuals ; and it is indeed remarkable that Tan jore should present two strikingly opposite phases of character, i. e., charitable disposition, as evinced by the number of these institutions, on the one hand, and the moral depravity as shown by the wholesale misappropriation of temple endowments, on the other. (6) A place where food and drink are distributed gratuitously."], [250, "216 The disposition to charity is evinced chiefly by people of the pddra castes. Hardly is any considerable amount of money acquired whether in trade, agri culture or Government service, of which a consider able portion is not devoted to the erection of a chuttrum or the endowment of some particular service in a temple. The property of a childless widow as a rule is dedicated to such purposes. The form which the charity generally takes in cases of small endow ments is a water pandal(7) for the refreshment of travellers in the hot season. Another form adopted* where the available resources are limited, is what is called \" Dvadasi Kattalei,\" i. e., the distribution of cooked meals to twelve Brahmans on the twelfth day of the moon. (See Chapter V.) This form of cha rity, though essentially of a sectarian character, is not the less generally adopted. The expenses of 17.

Among poorer classes of Brahmans, it not unfrequently happens that one mortgages his house as also what little landed property he possesses to raise the money re quired for the defrayal of the necessary marriage ex penses. The heavier items of expenditure are jewels for the bride, presents of cloths to her and to rela tions generally, and general entertainments. Pandal, processions and music are also essential ; but their cost is relatively small ; at any rate it is more easily controlled. Nautch parties are held only by the richer classes.

It may be generally stated here that sacrifices, prayers and rituals, which have for their object the invoca tion of the blessings of gods and of the souls of de parted forefathers on the married couple, and a solemn declaration of the contract of marriage, with all the ceremonies which are considered to make it inviolable, constitute the sum and substance of the whole. These ceremonies are of course most elabo rate among Brahmans and, gradually diminishing in the scale of castes, all but disappear among the lowest. Mutual rejoicing and interchange of enter tainments between the relations and friends of the bride and bridegroom by force of custom form a ne cessary part of a Hindu marriage. In these latter, among the highest classes, the relations of the bridegroom as a rule receive far more attention from those of the bride than do the latter from them ; this being the necessary consequence of the system of early marriages and the constitution of a Hindu family, which render the happiness of the girl who is given away in marriage in a great measure depend ent, at least in the early part of her matrimonial life, on the good-will and tenderness of her hus band's relations. It is the anxious desire of the parents of the bride to give no cause of dissatisfaction (8) According to the Castras, the ceremonies extend over four days ; but well-to-do people sometimes keep up the festivities for a week and even longer, while those in poor circumstances get through them all in two or three days often in one day. The principal ceremony of betrothal among all classes takes place invariably in the bride's house. Among Mahrattas, Brahman as well as Cudra, the parents of the bridegroom have to give a series of entertainments as well as presents in cloths, in exchange for those which they receive from the bride's parents, and have also to observe religious rites and offer sacrifices in their own house ; but among all other castes, they are generally mere guests at the bride's house."], [252, "218 to any member or even a distant relation of the bride groom's family. If perchance the present to any one of them of betel-nut, flowers or scents on any one of the numerous occasions on which these presents are repeated daily during the course of the marriage festivities is omitted, ample apology is made for the omission. On the occasion of her daughter's mar riage, the most stingy and peevish woman becomes the most amiable and liberal. Those wdiose idea of the affection of Hindu parents for their daughters is derived chiefly from what they have read of female infanticide of the Rajaputs and the slavery of women in Asiatic countries generally, can hardly realize the state of mind of the parents, more especially among the higher classes, at the final conclusion of the ceremonies of betrothal when, as they feel, the girl is no longer their child. When the Sanscrit verse signifying the committal of the girl to the tender care of the bridegroom's relations is solemnly repeated, and the girl successively placed on the lap of every one of them ; a gloom is cast over the whole scene in the bride's house, and a suppressed wailing takes the place of the bustle of rejoicing. The mother and sisters retire into inner rooms, so that they may not present the unseemly spectacle of shedding tears in the midst of an assembly of re lations and friends on an occasion of rejoicing ; and even the father needs much self-control not to be tray the emotions of his heart. Every Hindu doubt less seeks for a male in preference to a female issue, because the son is considered, by the performance of the funeral obsequies which he alone could perform, to enable the souls of his parents to cross the gulf of hell. Some even consider the birth of a daughter a misfortune for the reason that her happiness de-"], [253, "219 Sports and amuse meats. pends solely upon the character of the person to whom she is married, and that, owing to the system of early marriage, he could not say what the husband he selects for her may eventually turn out. But it is altogether a mistake to suppose, that Hindu parents have less affection for their daughters than for their sons; the mistake is much the same as that which assumes the condition of Hindu women to be little better than African slavery. Nothing can be more touching than the scene which a family presents when a daughter is for the first time, after marriage, sent home with all her paraphernalia to her husband, more especially if he happened to live in a remote country, and also when, after a long separation, she comes to her parents' roof to spend a few days with them. On both occasions, she becomes the centre of affection in the family, and the young ones will never leave her. As a rule, a Hindu in well-to-do circumstances will refuse nothing that a daughter asks ; but daughters, as a rule, are very sparing in the expression of their wants. Jealousies and quarrels are of course not rare in Hindu families ; the father and mother quarrel ; the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law quarrel (this indeed is the rule) ; the son and his wife quarrel too ; but it is very seldom that a brother quarrels with his sister ; much less a father or mother with a daughter. 19. Field sports are almost unknown, and so are also gymnastics. The amusements of boys are swimming, sometimes jumping from a height into the river or tank ; flying kites ; throwing balls, and such other common plays ; while those of girls consist of play with chouries, tamarind seeds and the nuts of Guilandina Bonduc, besides those with"], [254, "220 Annual festivals dolls in a great variety of forms. These give the young some sort of exercise ; but grown-up men have no athletic or manly exercises ; some play cards, and some among the higher classes chess (gambling is very rare) ; while women play like the girls with chouries, or the balls called \" Ammanei,\" or amuse themselves with cradle and other homely songs. Needlework and painting on walls, both of a primi tive kind, occupy some portion of the time of Mah ratta women ; but these are unknown among other classes. The more common amusements among all, more especially the lower classes, are temple festi vals and processions. Dinner parties, otherwise than at marriages, are also common among the higher classes. They take place ordinarily when friends and relations meet, and sometimes the dinner is fol lowed by a musical entertainment, vocal or instru mental, and occasionally by a nach (nautch). In most entertainments females take part ; but whether at dinner or musical entertainment, they form a separate group of themselves, occupying generally a separate compartment. As a rule, females of respectable classes do not relish nach parties. 20. These are numerous. Those common to all castes and sects, as well as most important, are : \u2014 1. The new year's day. 2. Sarasvati or Ayudha puja. 3. Dipavali. 4. Sankranti or Pongal. The first (new year's day) for Tamilians falls generally on 12th April, and for Mahrattas, Kanarese and Telugu, in the latter part of March. The second is dedicated to Minerva (Sarasvati), and on this day Brahmans offer worship to their books and other classes to their tools and instruments"], [255, "221 and to carriages and horses ; hence the other name of the festival \" ayudha puja;\" Ayudham signify ing weapons. This festival occurs in October on the day next preceding the Dasara festival, which will be noticed in its place. The third (dipavali) means literally \" Lighting festival ;\" but it is in tended to commemorate the destruction of a monster called \" Narakasura\" by the god Krishtna. The chief observance at this festival is oil-bath early in the morning, which is considered to be equivalent to bathing in the Ganges, and the burning of crackers and fireworks and the firing of guns. This latter observance is undertaken exclusively by the young and forms the most interesting amusement to them. The dipavali festival is held by all classes, more especially the upper, to be of the greatest import ance. It occurs in October or November. The fourth (Sankranti or Pongal) is the day on which the sun passes from Sagitarius to Capricornus ; it falls almost invariably on the 12th January. This festival is even of greater importance than dipavali to the lower classes, and the ceremony very gener ally observed is the inauguration of the use of the chief corns of the season, just then harvested or supposed to be harvested. (9) The new corn is boiled in milk with dholl and sugar, and is offered with cakes and fruits to the sun and other gods and then partaken with much eclat by all the family sitting together. The food thus prepared is what is called \" pongal.\" The following day is the festival of cows and oxen which are decked with flower garlands, (their horns being generally painted) and are fed with \" pongal.\" Bullocks are not worked on this day. (9) Generally the better sorts of paddy, i. e., c emba, is harvested at this time. 29"], [256, "222 21. Of the festivals peculiar to particular castes and communities, the more important are : \u2014 Sri Bdmanavami. \u2014 This is the birthday of Dasaratha Rama or Ramachendra, consider- ed to be one of the incarnations of Vishnu, and is observed with much interest by Mahrattas, Brahman as well as pudra, and to some extent also by the Kanarese and Telugu people. It is altogether foreign to the Dravidian nation, and was in- troduced into the country apparently by Mahrattas. This festival occurs at the end of March. I. Padinettdmfierukku. \u2014 This is peculiar to the Cauvery delta, and is intended to celebrate the rising of the river, which is considered to occur invariably on the eighteenth day of the solar month, Adi (Sanskrit Kataka), corresponding to the end of July \u2014 hence the name \" padinettamperukku,\" padi- nettu signifying eighteen and perukku, rising.

This festival occurs generally in August. 5 Sri Jayanti or Krishna jananam. \u2014 This is the birthday of Krishtna, another incarnation of Vishnu, and falls about the end of August. This is observed chiefly by the people of the Vaishnava sect, and more particularly by cowherds who call them- selves Yadavas. This is a fasting day for Brahmans. 6. Vindyakacaturthi or Pilleiydrcauti. \u2014 This falls about ten days after the preceding and is dedicated to Vinayaka, (called in Tamil Pilleiyar), the son of the god piva, who is worshipped by all classes of the paiva sect (the unaryanized aborigines ex- cepted) as the dispenser of learning and the remover of difficulties to all worthy under- takings. This last attribute is represented by a third name of this deity, i. .., Vigh- nesvar. 7. Sarvapitri dmdvdsyd. \u2014 This is the new moon of the lunar month Bhadrapada, and is a particularly sacred day for Brahmans alone who make offerings to the departed souls of all their ancestors, which is what the prefix of the name of the festival signifies. 8.

This festival occurs on the full moon day in the solar month \" kartikei.\" Svargadvdra or Mukkoti Yekddasi, called also Vaikuntha Yekddasi. \u2014 This occurs in December and is a grand festival to Vaishnavas.

Mahd givaratri. \u2014 This is the greatest sacred and fasting day for the paiva sect, and for that alone every where. It occurs in the beginning of March. (See Nellore Ma- nual, page 194). 13. Hutdganapaurnimd, popularly Kdmanpandigei. \u2014 This is the well-known Cupid's festival which is celebrated on the full moon of the lunar month \" Phalguna\" and occurs generally in March. This is observed generally by the lower classes. The object of this festival is to commemorate the"], [259, "225 destruction of Cupid and with him of all temptation to wickedness by the god piva; but for the voluptuous world it presents an occasion for unrestrained in- dulgence in drunkenness and debauch.

This custom, however, is more generally observed only the first year of the marriage."], [260, "226 Hindu temples, PART II. CHAPTER V. NATIVE RELIGIOUS AND CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS AND PUBLIC DISPENSARIES. The number of Hindu temples and native charity houses known as \" Chattrams \" or \" Choultries \" constitute one of the special features of Tanjore. No where in the South and probably in the whole continent of India are so many of these institutions to be found within such a small area. 2. The total number of these in this district is computed to be something over 3,000, being about a half of the number comprised in the whole Presi dency ; but apparently, this number does not include the almost innumerable small village temples/1' which do not possess any separate endowments in land or money, but are maintained or neglected by the villagers just as it suits their inclinations. 3. Many of the larger temples are splendid edifices and possess extensive and valuable endow ments in land. The temple endowments in Tanjore are divisible under three heads, to wit : (1) Original endowments in the shape of Inams or grants of land revenue. (2) Assignments of land revenue in lieu of ready money payments to which the institu tions were entitled under \" Treaties and Engagements.\" (l) By these are meant not the Shrines of Tutelary or demon Gods, but the divinities of the Brahmanical pantheon."], [261, "227 (3) Ryotwari lands, i.e., those paying revenue to Government, of which the right of pro- prietary occupancy is alone vested in the temples. The endowments under the first head were made by the native rulers and those under the second merely represent the endowments in money made by them. There is no information on record as to how the lands comprising the third head became the pro perty of temples. Probably, they were given away by individual Mirasi holders, from motives of piety, (See Mr. Ellis' Mirasi paper, P.M.R., p. 257), and it is also not improbable they were to some ex tent acquired by purchase out of temple funds during the days the latter were faithfully adminis tered. The extent and value of the endowments in the aggregate under the first two heads are : \u2014 Extent. Revenue. Acres. Rs. Original Inams 97,363 2,00,320* Assignments in lieu of ready money payments 38,517 1,62,530 Total 1,35,880 3,62,850 The value of endowments in Ryotwari land is not easily ascertainable. For the last ten years of the period during which they were under Government management, the Government revenue on the lands averaged Rs. 1,64,311, and the net profits of the temples Rs. 36,323 ; but in those days, owing to low prices, the profits of the Mirasi holders were very small. Now, on a moderate calculation, they come to something more than double the Government revenue, (see Part III, Chap. II, p. 39), and there * Note. \u2014 These figures are ou!y iipproximate."], [262, "228 seems to be no reason why, under efficient and faith ful management, they should not be at least as much. Taking them at this rate as Rs. 3,28,622, with the annual value of the endowments under the other two heads, they make a total of Rs. 6,91,472. 4. The managements of all the temples, as well as their endowments, is conducted by private trus tees under the supervisory control, more or less nominal, of the committees appointed under Act XX, of 1863 ; there being three committees for the three circles^ into which the district is divided for this purpose. Misappropriation of the income, in most cases wholesale, and the general neglect of the buildings, as well as of the usual service in the temples, are now the universal complaint in Tanjore as everywhere else. 5.

An old brick tower, \u00b0r amarcieciire about 70 feet high, in ruins, known as \" Mottei Gdpuram\" (bald tower) at Negapatam, and a Qaiva temple at Tiruvalanjuli, in which latter there are a few beautiful sculptured images, are ascribed to the Jain origin ; but this is a mere surmise, and there seems to be nothing of distinctively Jain type in these monuments. 2. The Hindu temples which dot the whole delta Ancient ____. of the Cauvery are in fact almost the only monuments temple at Tanjore. of antiquity in this district. The most celebrated is the great temple of Brihadisvarasvami at Tanjore, which, it is believed, was built by the famous Kul6t tunga or Virac61a in the eleventh century A. D. The height of its tower is variously stated at 199(1) and 205 feet ;(2> the basement of the structure which supports the tower is 96 feet square. A vil lage called C/arappallam (Scaffold hollow), about four miles north-east from Tanjore, is generally pointed out as the place whence the scaffold or inclined plane commenced, up which the single block of gra nite, said to be 25^ feet square,(3) which surmounts the tower was conveyed to the top. The local legend (1) Symond's Introduction to the Geography and History of India, 3rd Edition, page 211. (2) As given by an old and apparently well-informed Brick mason at Tanjore. (3) In Pharoah and Co.'s Gazetteer of Southern India the weight of this block of granite is estimated to be not less than 80 tons (page 355 )"], [278, "244 \" Cola Caritra\" says, that this shrine took twelve years to build, and that the work was executed under the superintendence of a mason of the name of S6mavarma from Kanchipuram (Conjeveram). Next to the lofty tower, which is remarkable as much for its beauty as for its height, the monument of sculp- ( tural art, as well as object of curiosity, in this temple, is the huge bull in the court facing the shrine \u2014 \" a very fine carved monolith, said to consist of black granite or syenite\"(4) Next to this is the small tem- ple of Subrahmanyasvami in the north-west corner of the court, built of a pale quartzose gneiss. Of this structure, Mr. R. Bruce Foote of the Geological Survey says, \" it is a perfect gem of carved stone- work, and the tooling of the stone in the most exqui- sitely delicate and elaborate patterns is as clear and sharp as the day it left the sculptor's hands : it is justly an object of great pride to the people of Tanjore.''^5) Tbe other large 3. Of the other larger temples those most re- markable for their size, high towers, general symmetry and massive structure are the temple at Tiruvarar, and the larger ones at Combaconum, Truvalanjuli, Madhiyarjunam, Mayaveram, Vaiddisvaran k6il and Avuduyarkoiipago- Avudeiyar koil. The one, however, which presents the most interesting features to the artist, is the pagoda at the place last named, built presumably by Manikyavacakar, the famous minister of the Pandya Kingdom in the ninth century. The sculp ture of the images, as well as the architecture (4) Report by Messrs. William King Junr. and R. Bruce Foote. (Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, Vol. IV, part 2, page 145) Mr. Foote in a foot-note says, \" the figure was so thoroughly covered over with a coating of red laterite dust mixed with the sacrificial oil, that I could not pretend to say what might be the nature of the stone underneath.\" Col. Baird Smith in his report on the Cauvery, Krishtna and Godavari Anikats (page 45, note) describes it as an admirable specimen of animal sculpture, and roughly estimates its weight as 25 tons.

The Tiruvar ur pagoda with the large tank in its rear is in a high degree picturesque. All these edifices, excepting the Avudeiyar k6il temple, are of much the same type and probably of about the same date as the great pagoda at Tanjore. 4. The only specimen of ancient native work Ancient native work other than temples is the Grrand Aneikkattu temples. (Anicut), which is the key to the irrigation of Tanjore. This work, however, is remarkable only for its great utility as well as strength ; it is of a primitive style and makes no pretensions to archi tectural merit. A full account of this work will be found under the head of irrigation. 5. Besides the numerous works of irrigation and Modern W0lka of \u00b0 art. communication, which will be noticed in their proper places, the modern works of art which require special notice are the Nagiir mosque and minaret already noticed ; the minaret and miniature castle built by His Highness Baja Sarabhoji at S'aluvanayakkanpat- tanam on the Palk's Bay in 1814, \" to commemorate the triumphs of the British arms and the downfall of Bonaparte ;\"(6> the Light house at Negapatam (see Chap. I of this part) ; the Beacon column at Point Calimere; and the marble statues of the Rev. Mr. C. F. Schwartz and Baja Sarabhoji. Mr. Schwartz's statue executed by the celebrated Flaxman is the monument raised to his memory by his grateful ward and pupil Sarabhoji, and is placed in the Church on the side of the Civaganga tank in the little Fort at Tanjore. It is a bas-relief on which the Raja is re presented paying his last visit to Schwartz in com pany with some of his ministers and three boys from Schwartz's School. The Raja's own statue stands (6_- These are the words of the inscription 32"], [280, "246 on a raised platform in the arched hall called Jiratk'hana in the Tanjore palace. Both these statues were erected in the beginning of this century. Of the slab of stone which supports the Raja's statue, Mr. Foote speaks thus : \u2014 \" In the Durbar hall in the Raja's palace at Tan jore is a magnificent slab of gneiss, raised some height from the ground, and supporting a fine white marble statue (by Chantrey) of the late Raja, in lieu of the throne which formerly occupied the slab. The dimensions of this splendid slab are : \u2014 length 18 feet, width 16 feet, depth 2 feet 1^ inches. The upper surface is polished, and shows well the foliation of the work, which is a quartzo-felspathic gneiss ; but the slab, though well cut, cannot be called well polished, and looks of a dingy brown color, owing very probably, to the peculiar method of polishing in use bv the natives.\""], [281, "247 General observa- tions on the state of education. Female education. PART II. CHAPTER VII. EDUCATION. 1. Tanjore has always been famed as the principal seat of Hindu intelligence in the South ; but its in tellectual resources have received very considerable development since the establishment of the Govern ment Provincial School, latterly raised to a College, at Combaconam. Of the 599 scholars, who obtained the M. A. and B. A. degrees since the foundation of the Madras University in 1857 up to the year 1876-77, no less than 144 are Tanjoreans. According to the last census (1871), the percentage of persons able to read and write or under instruction to the total population of the district is 8\"8 ; while in the other districts of Madras Presidency (the Presidency town excepted), it ranges from 2\"3 in Vizagapatam to 8*2 in Tinnevelly, where the praiseworthy efforts of Mis sionaries to spread elementary instruction among the masses have been most unremitting. Taking the male population alone, the percentage in Tanjore is IS'OS ; while in other districts it ranges from 4\"4 in Vizagapatam to 15\"9 in Tinnevelly. 2. Female education, however, is still in a back ward state ; it is surrounded with peculiar difficulties and in a district, where national habits ancl pre judices, which have to be overcome, survive to so large an extent, any material improvement in this respect must be a work of time. With the stimulus, however, which the female education has received of late years, and the annually increasing number of"], [282, "248 Number and distri bution of schools. Girls' schools ; gradual and steady progress may be hoped for. On this subject, the Inspector of Schools of the 4th Division, Mr. Bradshaw, in his adminis tration report for 1872-73, writes as follows : \u2014 \" Tanjore stands first of all the districts in the Fourth Division in the state and standard of educa tion ; so in it, as might be expected, female educa tion is most encouraged, and it is a hopeful sign to see so many Girls' schools under native manage ment. The number of girls reading in Tanjore exceeds that in all the schools in the three other districts put together.\" 8. In the year 1876-77, the total number of educa tional institutions dealt with by the Department of Public Instruction was 709, with 25,263 pupils (23,848 male and 1,415 female) on their rolls, which gave on an average one to every 78 of the total popu lation. Taking the school-going male population alone,'1' which is generally assumed at 15 per cent, of the entire population; the proportion of the total number of male pupils thereto is one to six ; the number of female pupils is one to 108 of the school-going female population assumed in like man ner.

CHAPTER VIII. MISSIONS/1) 1. Tanjore was the scene of the earliest labors of Protestant Mission the Protestant Missionaries in India. As will be seen from the History of European Settlements in Tanjore, the Danish East India Company acquired the small territory of Tranquebar under a Grant from the then Nayak Raja, through the exertions of Ove Gedde, the Commander of the fleet which brought the first Danish Colony to the East Indies, and of Roelant Crape, the Dutch sailor who had been at the Court of Tanjore in his early youth and had now taken service in this Company. In the year 1620, immediately on his arrival at Tranquebar, Gedde laid the foundation for the fortress of \" Dansborg\" and the Church in the Fort, of which the first Pastor was Peder Sorensen Aale who died some years afterwards at Tranquebar. 2. It was not, however, until 1706, or a little less m Foundation of Tranquebar Mission than a century after the foundation of the Danish 1706. Settlement, that any movement for the spread of the Gospel among the natives was set on foot. Certain assertions, uncorroborated and apparentlyuncredited, give Jacob Worm, \" Master of Arts, Preacher and J-**-\"* Worm 168\u00b0 to Aoyi. Poet,\" who spent the last years of his life (1680 to 1691) at Tranquebar, under a sentence of transporta- (1) The greater part of this Chapter is based on the History of the Tranquebar Misaion by J. Ford Fenger and the quotations are all from that book."], [294, "260 Heinrich Plutschau and Bartholomaua Ziegenbalg. tion,(2) the credit of having translated the Bible and preached to the people in the streets ; but if he did anything in the cause of evangelization, no traces of his work remained in after years. In the words of J. Ferd Fenger, the Historian of the Tranquebar Mission, \" he is very improperly called the Danish Apostle of India in his epitaph,\" in the Fort Church. 3. King Frederick IV of Denmark, on his acces sion to the throne, felt strongly the desire to send forth Missionaries to Tranquebar, and procured from Berlin, through the Court Preacher at Copenhagen, Franz Julius Liitkens, two young German clergymen, Heinrich Plutschau of Wesenberg in Mecklenburg and Bartholomaus Ziegenbalg of Pulsnitz in Upper Lausitz ; these two were in fact the first founders of the Protestant Mission in India. They arrived at Tranquebar on the 9th July 1706, but met among the Danish merchants and officials with \" not only no sympathy for their undertaking, but a cold and an almost inimical reception.\" 4. The following is the description Ziegenbalg gives of the people among whom he and his colleague commenced the work of evangelization : \u2014 \" Most Christians in Europe suppose the Mala barians(3) to be a very barbarous people; but this arises from the Europeans who have been amongst them not understanding their language, so that they have not been able to read their books, but have drawn their conclusions from outward appearances. I must ac knowledge that, when I first came amongst them, I could not imagine that their language had proper rules, (2) This was for publishing satirical writings of the coarsest nature in Denmark, against the king, the nobility and the bishop of Viborg ; the transportation having been a commutation, at the intercession of his friends, of the sentence first passed on him, by which he was condemned to lose three fingers and to have his head struck off by tbe sword. (3) This was the name by which the e_.-ly European Colonists called the natives of the Tamil oouatry."], [295, "261 or that their life had the laws of civil order, and took up all sorts of false ideas on their actions as if they had neither a civil nor a moral law ; but as soon as I had gained a little acquaintance with their language and could talk to them on various subjects, I began to have a much better opinion of them, and when at last I was able to read their own books, I found that the Malabarians discussed the same philosophical subjects as the Savans of Europe, and that they had a regular written law wherein all theological subjects were treated of and demonstrated. This surprised me extremely, and I was delighted to be thoroughly instructed in their heathenism from their own writings.\" It appears, that Ziegenbalg was not long in dis covering, that the natives were aware that there was only one Supreme Being, and that the learned among them could discourse well on the subject. 5. The first thing which, on their arrival, occu pied the time and attention of the Missionaries, was the study of the language of the country. They had to learn also Portuguese, because the latter, in a corrupted form, was the language spoken generally by the Eurasians who then went by the general name \" Portuguese\" and who formed the medium of com munication between Europeans and natives. They easily mastered the Portuguese, but Tamil presented great difficulty, as there were no school books, printed or in manuscript on paper. This difficulty they soon got over and by extraordinary persever ance and application, in the course of three years, so far mastered that language also as to be able to write books. 6. At the same time, the Missionaries did not forget the primary object of their mission. In 34"], [296, "262 November 1706, they began to catechise in Portu guese, and in January following, in Tamil. \" The first Baptism took place in May 1707, when five slaves who could speak Portuguese were baptised in Zion Church, after undergoing an examination.\" They next, in 1707, built a Church in the town, to which they gave the name \"New Jerusalem,\" and this having been found too small for the growing congregation, built another in the town in 1717, to which they gave the same name ; the old Church was then given up for the use of catechists and for funerals. It was not until 1743, that foundation was laid for the Church in the native town of Pureiyaru ; the building was finished and consecrated in 1746. About the same time the first Church was built, i. e., 1707, the Missionaries erected two schools, one, the \" Dano-Portuguese,\" of which the superintendence was undertaken by Plutschau, and the other a Tamil school, which Ziegenbalg took under his own : in both the children received food, drink, clothes and books. The number of conversions made among the natives by the Tranquebar Mission during the period of its fullest activity, i. e., from 1707 to 1740, is not clearly ascertainable. All that can be gathered on the subject is this : \u2014 By the end of 1707, the first year of its labors, the congregation (presumably native) grew to 35 persons; in 1712 it came up to more than 200 ; later on, the number of conversions made in one year, 1717, was more than thirty, and in the follow ing year upwards of fifty. In 1 740, the number of conversions made since the foundation of the Mission was computed at 5,600 ; it is not clear whether or not this number included those made in Madras and Cuddalore."], [297, "263 7. Plutschau returned to Europe in 1711, and never came again . Ziegenbalg went home in October 1714, and returned married in August 1716; dur ing his stay in Europe he paid a visit to England. He, in spite of the severe trials to which he was put, and the opposition which he is said to have met with from his own countrymen, continued to labor in the cause of the Mission with unflagging zeal and single-minded devotion until his death which took place at Tranquebar on the 23rd February 1719 at the age of 36. Indeed, the cause of the Protestant Mission in India is in no small degree indebted to the rare abilities as well as earnest labors of this first Missionary ; for Tranquebar was the centre from which the Mission spread first along the coast to Cuddalore, Madras and Calcutta, and in the inte rior to Tanjore, Trichinopoly and Palamcottah ; and it was from this centre that the celebrated German Missionaries Schultze, Fabricius, Schwartz, Gericke and Rottler went out to those other scenes of Mis sionary labor. 8. It was in mastering the Tamil literature (more especially poetry, the most difficult thing for a foreigner to master) and in composing and translat ing books in that language, that Ziegenbalg's extra ordinary talents and energies seem to have shown themselves. He translated the New Testament, compiled a Tamil Dictionary consisting of 40,000 words and expressions and composed a Tamil Gram mar, besides a considerable number of other books on Divinity in that language. He commenced also a translation of the Bible which, at the time of his death, had reached as far as the book of Ruth. His translation of the New Testament, which he com menced in October 1708 ancl finished in March 1711,"], [298, "264 was printed at Tranquebar at the Press supplied to the Mission by the English 9. Ziegenbalg often undertook journies into the country (the territory of the Tanjore principality) in order to become acquainted with the natives and to make Gospel known to them ; but it was not until 1729 that, as will be seen hereafter, the way to the capital was opened to the Missionaries. So early as 1708, he went to Negapatam, and on 2nd September 1709, he started from Tranquebar \" intending to penetrate into the dominions of the King of Tanjore wherever it was possible.\" The account the his torian of the Tranquebar Mission gives of this latter journey is interesting. \" They (Ziegenbalg and his servants),\" says he, \"journeyed on till they came to a village where he exchanged his black cloths for white, put a white turban on his head, a red striped piece of linen over his shoulders and red slippers on his feet. He required of his people that they should always speak the truth on their journey; for exam ple, if any one asked them whence they came, they were to say from Tranquebar ; where are you going ? To any place to which we can penetrate ; Who is your master ? A teacher from Tranquebar ; What have you come for ? To seek out people who wish to hear the truth and to have the word of God made known to them. This rule was scrupulously fol lowed.\" The party, when they got so far as Peru malei, a large village far south in the Tiruttureipundi taluk, were told that the white man should not travel without a Pass and were consequently detained. They were hospitably treated by the \" Hindus, Brah mans, tax-gatherers, writers and overseers of the revenue of the Province, making in all a large and important assembly,\" whom they met at Perumalei. Another means, by which Ziegenbalg brought him-"], [299, "265 self into contact with the natives, was by entering into correspondence with them. Wherever learned and experienced men were living, he sent letters and laid such questions before them as he thought each one could best answer. Answers were not wanting. In three months he received 55 letters which he put together and dedicated to the Crown- Prince, Christian (afterwards Christian VI), and he afterwards sent another collection of 44 letters.\" The tone and tenure of these letters will receive a cursory notice further on. 10. Ziegenbalg died, as already stated, in Feb ruary 1719, when the superintendence of the Mission devolved on Johan Ernst Griindler who had been his fellow-laborer and had worked with him with perfect cordiality as well as zeal and ability for ten years ; but the latter did not survive him more than a year; he died also at Tranquebar in March of the following year. 1 1. Griindler was succeeded by Benjamin Schultze, the founder of the Protestant Mission at Madras, who had arrived the year previous. Schultze was the Missionary next to Ziegenbalg and Griindler, who distinguished himself above others of his day for his ability, zeal and energy. He first composed a collection of Tamil hymns from the Halle hymn-book and taught the native children to sing them. He made it a rule to go out once a week to preach in the country, and in these excursions he used to take the native children with him; when he reached a village, he stopped on the road and began a hymn with the children in the European style. \" The sound of forty voices,\" the Historian of the Mission goes on to say, \" can be heard to a consi derable distance ; young and old, men and women,"], [300, "266 hastened to see what wras going on, and in this way he often collected between two and three hundred people. When the song was finished, he prayed and then addressed the assemblage. After this he talked with individuals to see whether his speech had been understood, and though he could not himself talk with all, his catechists mingled with the crowd and talked to the people of what they had heard.\" 12. Schultze opened the communication with the Capital of Tanjore. \" When,\" says the Histo rian, \" Schultze was at the head of the Mission, its fame reached as far as the Court of Tanjore, and a Prince of the name of Telungurasa^) , who was nearly related to the King, sent a Brahmin to Tranquebar in the year 1721, in order to inquire into its regulations. Schultze profited by this circum stance to begin a correspondence with the Prince in whom he gained a friend and protector for the Mission. Schultze even received an invitation to visit him, but he could not leave Tranquebar where he had so much to occupy him. When Schultze went to Madras, the other Missionaries wrote to the Prince and renewed the communication with him.\" 13. In 1726 Schultze entered the service of the English Society at Madras. In 1723 he began the continuation of Ziegenbalg's Tamil translation of the Bible and completed it in 1725 ; the whole was printed in 1728. In 1743, he returned to Europe and died at Halle in 1760 at the aare of 72. 14. The only events of importance which occurred since Schultze's disconnection with the Tranquebar Mission in 1726 until the venerable Schwartz first (4) It is impossible to guess who this person can have been. The dynasty of the Telugu or Nayak Rajas had been extinct at this time for about half a century. Probably, he was an officer of some influence in the Tanjore Court, whom his native agents represented to Schultze as a Prince."], [301, "267 came to notice in 1762 were the extension of the evangelical work to the Capital of the Principality through native agency in 1729. 15. It has been seen how Schultze had opened a communication with the so called Prince Telungurasa at the Capital. As the Historian goes on to say, \" Catechist Aaron was sent forth (1727) to inquire into the state of things in Tanjore, and to make the way easier to him, he had a letter and some small presents for Prince Telungurasa who received him very kindly, and invited the Missionaries to come to see him at Pulliruckumwolur (Vaiddisvarankoil), a town which lies about one day's journey north-west from Tranquebar, and to which he was going in the course of the next year to a heathen festival.\" Missionary Pressier accordingly, in March 1728, paid a visit to Telungarasa at Vaiddisvarankoil and was very kindly received and invited to visit him again at Tanjore at the celebration of his son's marriage which was to come off in the following spring. Pressier did so. About the same time, with the aid of Aaron and another native catechist, a Paraya of the name of Rayanayakan who had become a convert from the Roman Catholic to the Lutheran Church, a small congregation of converts to the latter was formed in the town of Tanjore. 16. The next Missionary visit to the Capital was not paid until 1753, when J. Chr. Wiedebrock accompanied the suite of Captain Sivers as interpreter to the latter at \" an audience with the King of Tanjore as a Danish Royal Commissioner and Chief of two men of War. Wiedebrock made use of this opportunity for communicating with the Christians in Tanjore, preached before the heathens, and recom mended the Mission and its congregations to the"], [302, "268 King. The recommendation was graciously received, the King saying\"\u2014\" They are my people.\" Next after this, in 1755, \" Johaun Wilhelm Berg, a native of Hamburg, who was a Captain in the service of the King of Tanjore, obtained permission for one of the Missionaries to come to the Capital to adminis ter the Lord's Supper to himself and others of the Evangelical Church who were residing there, a permission which was often repeated in following years.\" 17. In 1762, two of the Missionaries visited the Capital on Captain Berg's invitation, and one of these was the great and good man whose name is honorably associated not only with the Missionary cause, but also with the Political History of Tanjore. Christian Frederick Schwartz, like Benjamin Schultze, came from Sonnenburg in Germany. He was born, 26th October 1726 ; studied at Halle, where he received his first lessons in Tamil from Schultze on his return from India; was ordained at Copenhagen, 17th September 1749 ; landed at Cud dalore, 30th July 1750; labored at Tranquebar more than eleven years ; commenced the Mission in Trichinopoly 1762 ; settled at Tanjore 1778, and died there (unmarried) 13th February 1798. It is to Schwartz that the spread of the Protestant faith inland from Tranquebar is mainly due. 18. Inl762 Schwartz and his colleague Blein went from Tanjore to Trichinopoly, where they met with a warm and welcome reception from the Officers of the English garrison, and the former determined on re maining there. He first, by means of subscilptions raised by the English Officers and supplemented by donations from Navab Mahomed Ali, founded a School andChurch at Trichinopoly and thensimilar establish-"], [303, "269 ments at Tanjore ; at both stations he soon formed large congregations of converted Hindus and Roman Catholics. About the year 1768, Schwartz, with the consent of his Tranquebar brethren and the Mission College at Copenhagen, entered the service of the English Society. He founded the Tanjore Mission in 1778, when Tanjore became his principal resi dence ancl continued to be so until his death. Schwartz was respected by all classes of people and was a great favorite alike with the English, his native congregation and the Hindus. Like other distinguished German Missionaries, he united to abilities of a superior order and untiring energy, a thorough acquaintance with the native languages ; but it was his unaffected modesty, his cheerful ness and his thorough uprightness that constituted the essence of his success in his Missionary work. One remarkable trait of Schwartz was that, though he was never married, he was a great friend to children. 19. Schwartz's conversions, however, as has been the case more ov less everywhere, were con fined chiefly to the lower classes of natives and to Roman Catholics, and it is remarkable that not one single conversion of a Brahman is recorded any where in the History of the Tranquebar Mission and Schwartz's career. Mr. Schwartz had several in terviews with Rajas Tulzaji and Amarsing, and in variably met with courteous and cordial receptions from them. He availed himself of the very first opportunity, i. e., his first visit to Tulzaji on the 30th April 1769, to expound the doctrines of Chris tianity to the Raja and exhorted him to adopt them. The Raja seemed greatly interested by the discourse of the Padri and expressed much satisfaction at it. Mr. Schwartz, though he continued to recur to the 35"], [304, "270 subject whenever he found a suitable occasion in his interviews with the Raja, was evidently not long in discovering, that compliments of courtesy were all that he could elicit in answer to his orations at the Court of Tanjore. 20. An account of the warm interest which Mr. Schwartz took in the education and welfare of Prince Sarabhoji, whom his father Tulzaji entrusted to his care while on death-bed, and his successful advocacy of the claims of this young prince to the musnud from which he had been unjustly excluded, wrill be found in the last chapter on Political History. Mr. Schwartz though he was chiefly instrumental in establishing the title of that prince, did not live to see him seated on the musnud ; but Sarabhoji let slip no opportunity of evincing his respect for the memory of his departed instructor and benefactor, whom he 'called his father. He made liberal grants for the schools founded by Schwartz, and when, in 1808, Tranquebar was taken by the English, and the Mission establishment was in distress, contributed liberally forits support. Indeed, Raja Sarabhoji could not have left a more tangible and lasting mark of gratitude to his benefactor than he has in the monu ment raised by him to Schwartz's memory. See page 245 ante. 21. The venerable Mr. Schwartz, as already stated, died at Tanjore on the 13th February 1798. The love and esteem in which he was held by all classes can be best seen from the following extract from a letter of the Rev. Christian Wilhelm Gericke, who was present at his death and funeral: \u2014 \" The weeping and sobbing of the people in the two Christian villages was most touching. * * * The grief was universal at the loss of their teacher,"], [305, "271 comforter, instructor, benefactor, counsellor, pastor. It was not only we, the congregations, the schools and the Missions who had lost a father, but the whole country. Wherever he was known, tears were falling. Serfogee, his pupil and Prince of Tanjore, came to look at him once again before the coffin was closed, wetted him with tears and followed him to his grave. The servants of the departed stood near me and said in a low voice \"Now is our beloved gone:\" This went to my heart ; for this was not the saying of one, but of many, old and young, high and low, friends and strangers, Christians and Heathens, all spoke alike.\" 22. The Rev. Mr. Schwartz, as already said, left Tranquebar in 1762 and it was not long after this, that the Tranquebar Mission began to languish ; it sank gradually until, in 1820, it ceased to be the seat of Missionary activity. In the year last men tioned, the Mission was taken over by the Govern ment of the colony, when the Superintending Missionary, Aug. Fred. Cammerer, gave up to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge 1300 Christians and 1 1 Catechists, who were English sub jects in Tanjore, with the 11 small Churches belonging to them. \" The Mission in Tranquebar,\" said the Rev. Mrs. Cammerer, \"the mother of all others, must now sink down to be a small institution in one place only.\" In 1825, by a Resolution of the Tranquebar Government, the Pastorate of Zion Church and the office of the first Missionary were united, and it was declared that \" the spiritual pastors who bear the name Missionary in Tranquebar are to make efforts for"], [306, "272 the conversion of the heathen only where they can hope to succeed and where the moral character of the persons seems to call for it, but they are not to expect any money to be spent on the extension of Christianity.\" 23. The circumstances which led to the decay of the Tranquebar Danish Mission seem to have been, firstly a falling off in the number of competent and willing men to carry on the work of the Mission \u2014 the result partly of a temporary decline of religious zeal in Europe and partly of a division and dissensions at Halle, the main spring and centre of the early East India Missions ; and secondly the growth of the misunderstanding between the Mis sionaries and the Government at Tranquebar, the origin of which was almost coeval with the foundation of the Mission. Latterly, in consequence of the spring ing up of various English Missionary Societies, the Danish Mission at Tranquebar ceased to receive that support in English money, which contributed so largely to its development in the course of the last century. 24. The Tranquebar Danish Mission was latterly (in 1841) taken up by the Dresden Society which, under the name and title of Leipzig Society by which it has been known since 1848, has extended its operations into the district. 25. The present chief seat of the Protestant Mission in the District is Tanjore. It was first founded, as already stated, by the Rev. Mr. Schwartz in 1778, and in 1826 was taken over by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, who built Saint Peter's Church in 1830.

The German Lutheran Mission have a Higher Class and a Female Middle Class School at Tranquebar and a Middle Class School at Tanjore. The Wes leyan Mission have a Higher Class School at Mannar gudi and another at Negapatam, with Middle Class Schools at Nagur and Tiruttureipundi. Each of these three Societies has numerous lower class schools in different parts of the districts which, in like man ner with those above enumerated, are available for general education and open to all classes. 28. According to the census of 1871, the total number of native converts of the Protestant faith in the district is 10,378, which, next to Tinnevelly, is the largest in the whole Presidency, both taken by itself and relatively to the entire population of the district. \u25a0 29. The precise date of the advent of the Roman Catholic Mission into Tanjore is not known. It is said, that Saint Francis Xavier preached and made converts at Negapatam about the middle of the six- teenth century ; but apparently it was about the year 1612, when the church at Velanganni, about six miles south, was built, that Negapatam where, probably, the Portuguese had just then formed a settlement, became the seat of the active labors of the Catholic Missionaries. From Fenger's History of the Tranquebar Mission it appears, that sometime before its foundation in 1706, the Roman Catholics had a Church close to the principal gate of the Fort"], [309, "275 of Tranquebar; that about the year 1726, they built the Chapel dedicated to Saint Xavier in the suburb of Sattangudi, and that they were governed by a Padre Vicarious, who was subordinate to the Bishop of Saint Thom_ or Mylapore. 30. The Society of Jesus established their Missions in Tanjore apparently subsequent to the year 1765 when the Pondichery Jesuits, after an ineffectual attempt to found one at Tranquebar, left that neighbourhood. In 1846, those of the Madura Mission founded Saint Joseph's College, of which the object at first was to form a native clergy and to give instruction to the Roman Catholic chil dren ; as has been seen, however, in the preceding chapter, this institution has developed into one of great utility for general education. 31. The Vicariates Apostolic of Madura and Pon dichery have divided the district of Tanjore between them in the proportion of two-thirds to the former ancl one-third to the latter ; the boundary line between them being the river Cauvery down to the effluence of the Venna.ru, the Vennaru thence down to the effluence of the Vettaru and the Vettaru down to its disem boguement into the Sea at Nagur. The operations of the Pondichery Mission are accordingly carried on on the North and those of the Madura Mission on the South of this line. The principal stations of the Madura Mission in Tanjore are Negapatam, Tanjore, Vallam and Pattukk6ttei ; those of the Pondichery Mission are Tranquebar, Pilavudandei, Mayaveram and Combaconum. 32. The Indo-Portuguese or Goanese, besides those at Velanganni and Sattangudi already men tioned, have Churches also at several other stations, such as Negapatam and Tanjore. The most import-"], [310, "276 ant Roman Catholic Church in the district is the one at Velanganni, dedicated to Saint Mary, and an annual festival commencing on the 30th August and lasting ten days, which is celebrated at this place, draws an immense concourse of pilgrims from all parts of Southern India. 33. According to the last census, the total num ber of native Christians of the Roman Catholic per suasion in the district is 54,884. 34. The native Christian community is made up of the several Hindu castes thus : \u2014 35.

It has been seen, that the Missionaries not only experienced no opposition or persecution from the native Government during the period it surviv- ed, but had all reasonable facility afforded them. It is true that, when (in 1709) Ziegenbalg started from Tranquebar, \" intending to penetrate into the domains of the king of Tanjore wherever it was possible,\" he was unable to reach the capital, because he was told that a \" whiteman\" should not travel without a Pass ; but the Tranquebar Mission- aries met with no impediment in carrying on the work of conversion, through the agency of their native Catechists, in the dominions of the Raja; and it has been seen with what good will \" the large and important assembly\" of \" Hindus, Brahmans, tax- gatherers, writers and overseers of the revenue\" treated Ziegenbalg at Perumalei far south into the district. This is the more remarkable as no Euro- pean nation had then acquired Political power in the south. Raja Tulzaji, as has been seen, in the latter part of the century, showed every kindness to the venerable Schwartz ; he granted the piece of land on which stands Saint Peter's Church ; his successor Raja Amarsing presented to the Mission School a village in the neighbourhood of Tranquebar which yielded Rs. 1,000 annually. When latterly Tanjore took the place of Tranquebar as the chief seat of the Mission, the S. P. G. exchanged the vil lage with the British Government for another of the same value nearer Tanjore.*-5) (5) The village originally granted was Ayappadi, and the one with which it was exchanged is Cadayangal In the Combaconum Taluk. 30"], [312, "278 37. Having regard to these facts, and considering that the Protestant as well as Roman Catholic Mis sionaries have been indefatigable in their work, th e former for about a century and three quarters and the latter for nearly two centuries and three quarters; the measure of success which has attended their labors does seem very small. The fact seems to be that they have had a great deal of intellectual struggle in Tanjore. Ziegenbalg, the first Protestant Mission ary, who set about converting natives in 1707 says : \u2014 \" Though they are in great error and thick darknes3 both with regard to their lives and teaching ; yet I must declare that my conversations with them have often led me to deeper considerations of many subjects, and that both in theology and in philoso phy, I have learned much of which neither I nor other students had thought before. I remember that many learned people in Europe have written on the manner in which the heathen ought to be con verted ; but there was no difficulty in this, as there was no one but themselves to contradict them. If these men were to come here, they would find that, for one reason which they brought forward, the heathen would have ten to oppose them. It requires great wisdom to converse with such people.\" The following are the replies, which Ziegenbalg, in a discourse viva voce, received from a Brahman. (1) \" God has created both the good and the evil, he is the author of virtue and vice, as well as of salva tion and destruction ; without him nothing can take place in the world. If some are good, pious and holy, they are so according to the will of God : and again, if some are wicked, sinful and unholy, they are sinners according to the will of God. If we are mistaken in our religion and our worship, it hap pens with tho consent of God. What can we do ?"], [313, "279 What is to happen to us on this earth, and how God has willed that we are to live and conduct ourselves, is all written on our heads. How can we alter what God has determined ?\" (2) \" Every man can be saved by his religion if he does that which is good and avoids that which is evil.\" (3) \" I do not find fault with anything you have said, yet I think that when one believes in God and leads a quiet, virtuous and holy life, it is unnecessary to believe in Christ and to be baptized.\" Allusion has been made already to Ziegenbalg's written correspondence with learned Hindus. The following extract is a specimen of the replies he used to receive. \" If we were heathens and our religion were quite false, you would find neither virtue nor good works amongst us ; but now you meet with many virtues and people active in good works, yea even some who live so holy a life that no sin can be imputed to them. Is it possible then that a law which dis- claims all sins, and leads to good, can be a false law ? Every nation has its own fashions, manners and laws which appear absurd to other nations. It is the same with the religions. God is manifold in all his creations and in all his works, and therefore he will be worshipped in different ways. Our law and our religion are good in themselves, and it is our own fault that they are thus blamed, partly because we do not live up to them, and partly because we have not such a knowledge of them as to refute all objec tions by true arguments and to be able to defend our precepts circumstantially.\" # * #"], [314, "280 \" However long we may dispute about religion, we may all finally say : \u2014 we are all God's creatures, and have a like entrance into and exist from this world. In so far as God shows mercy towards us, we are blessed ; as he rules us and reigns over us, we must live under him and can neither add to nor take away from anything which he has ordained concerning us.\" It will be seen how temperate and inoffensive is the tone in which the Hindus conducted the discus sion at a time when they were living under a purely Hindu Government, and had nothing to fear from the European Missionary. This is the more re markable as Ziegenbalg in the server of his zeal is not likely to have been very moderate in the denun ciation of idolatry."], [315, "281 Literature. Tamil PART II. CHAPTER IX. LITERATURE; FINE ARTS; NATIVE HYGIENE, Ac. The native literature of Tanjore, like that of every other part of India, consists chiefly of verse in both the vernacular and Sanskrit. The vernacular of the district is Tamil, an agglutinative language of the great Turanian family. W Its grammatical forms are purely Turanian ; but its vocabulary is formed partly and chiefly of Sanskrit derivatives, more or less completely altered, of the class, which the San skrit philologers designate by the term \" tatbhava,\" i. e. born in or descended from it, and all but those indicative of the earliest stage of civilization are words of this class. Entire Sanskrit words of the class of \" tatsama\" (.. e. same as it is), which have latterly found-, their way into the current dialect, form no part of the Tamil vocabulary, and the lan guage can well dispense with them altogether. S'entamil (the learned language) is a highly culti vated and refined language, and is believed to have been improved and brought to its present state of perfection by the Jainas between the eighth and thirteenth centuries A. D.<2> The chief seat of Tamil literature, as is well known, was Madura, (1.) It seems to be supposed by some, that the Dravidian languages are inflectional ; but this is evidently a mistake. They present the essential characteristics of the agglutinative stage ; the principal roots of words distinctly maintain their independence, and those which form the termina tions or modificatory syllables can be taken to pieces without disturbing the consciousness of the stems.

It may perhaps be assumed, that Pattauattu Pillei lived about the time of the decline of this town, i. c in the thirteenth century.

Arunachalakavi's exact date is not known, apparently he was a very recent author. 5. The Tamil literature, however, has long ceased Decline of Tamil \u00b0 Literature. to be cultivated by any but Missionaries and a few natives who serve as Munshis to Europeans. Its decline may be said to date from the thirteenth century, the probable date of the immigration of the great majority of the Brahmans, who introduced the Sanskrit literature from the north. Since then the colloquial language has become so much corrupted and now differs so much from the learned Tamil, that it is difficult to make one sentence, written or spoken grammatically, intelligible to any but the learned. Of course in every language there is a difference between the diction of an educated and that of an uneducated man; but the difference between the learned and colloquial Tamil is not of that kind; the two are much alike two different languages.C4*) A European Missionary may be seen preaching to an assembly of natives at a public place, without any one among them understanding one word of what he says. Indeed, if a native, who has acquired a knowledge of learned Tamil, makes (4.)

Within the last twenty years, the tests prescribed for the University and the Uncovenanted Service Examina- tions have given a sort of impetus to the study of learned Tamil ; but the student learns just as much as is required for the purpose and this'with almost as much difficulty as Latin or Greek, and after he has passed his examination, hardly gives a thought to his newly-acquired Tamil, much less employs it in prac- tice ; indeed, not a few fail once, twice, even thrice in passing the Tamil test. In Tanjore, Tamil is less pure than the dialect as it is written or spoken southward in Madura and Tinnevelly, but not quite so impure as that which is current in the districts northwards : it contains more of uncorrupted Sans krit words of the class of \" tatsama\" than it does anywhere else, and less of the Telugu and Hindu- stani words than in North Arcot, Chingleput, and around Madras. 6. The only other native languages current in Tanjore are Telugu and Mahrat hi. Telugu is perhaps the best developed of the Turanian languages by Aryan culture. Its literature appears to have been introduced here as elsewhere in the south during the days of the Nayak Rajas (sixteenth and seventeenth centuries) ; but very little traces of it now survive, and it is found only in musical compositions. The language, much corrupted by the admixture of Tamil words and idioms, continues to be spoken by all classes of the Telugu nationality, and to be used as the medium of written communication amongst themselves by only the Telugu Brahmans, who retain also their books on Theology, Astrology and general literature."], [319, "285 Mahrathi. 7. The Mahrathi vocabulary is formed chiefly of Sanskrit derivatives of the class of \" Tatbhava,\" with a small admixture of Arabic and Persian words ; its grammatical structure, like that of other modern Aryan dialects of India, is entirely of the Sanskrit type. This language was introduced from the Dakhan by the Mahratta colony which followed Yekdji on his conquest of 'Tanjore in 1675, and the successive Mahratta Rajas down to the last, Siva ji, more or less patronized its study and culture. During the days of the Mahomedan rule, as also for a considerable time after the establishment of British power, the Mahrathi, in a form much corrupted by contact with the Hindustani and Dravidian dialects, was the official language of accounts in all the districts of the Madras Presidency; in 1855 it ceased to be so everywhere. This official language, however, differed as much from the Tanjore dialect as the Tanjore dialect differed from the pure Mahrathi of the north ern Mahratta country. Its abolition as the language of accounts in Tanjore was about coeval with the extinction of the titular dignity of the Tanjore Raj, consequent on the death of the last Raja without male heirs, and, as might be expected, it is now fast disappearing as a written language. There is not one single Mahrathi school in the whole district now ; the families of the early Mahratta colony, whose residence is almost exclusively the fort of Tanjore, give their childen an elementary education in their mother tongue in their own houses ; but this must also cease in course of time. 8. The Mahrathi has a beautiful as well as copious literature both in prose and verse. During the days of the Mahratta Rajas, there were many learned scholars and also some distinguished poets in the town of Tanjore ; but the literature had come chiefly 37"], [320, "286 Sanskrit. from the Dakhan. The most celebrated of the Dak han poets are Nanide v, Gyandba or Gyanadev, Vaman, Ram Das, Tukaram and Mayiira Pandit or Mdrd Pant. The first two were contemporaries, and their probable date is conjectured by Mr. John Beams to be about the close of the thirteenth century..1) The date of the third is unknown. Ram Das and Tukaram were both contemporaries of the illustri ous Sivaji in the seventeenth century, and the former was his spiritual preceptor. Mdrd Pant's date was 1720. Namdev was a tailor of the Cudra caste, and Tukaram a banian who failing in trade devoted himself to the worship of Vithoba, the God of Pandharipur ; the rest were Brahmans. The poems held in the highest esteem are those of Mdrd Pant ; there is hardly a Sanskrit epic or Purana which has not been translated by him in high literary style and in the metre called \"Arya,\" a couplet, which Sir William Jones justly characterises as \"masterly\" and \" melodious. \"(6) It must be admitted, however, that Mdrd Pant's poems are half Sanskrit ancl half Mahrathi. Next to him, the poet of literary merit is Vaman. The works of the other poets are remarkable chiefly for the piety they inculcate. 9. The Sanskrit literature current in Tanjore is, as everywhere else, what the earlier Brahman colonists brought with them from the north. The south of the Peninsula has produced few poets and fewer works of any great literary merit. Kanchi puram (Conjeeveram) was in early times no doubt the seat of Brahmanical literature ; but the works which emanated from this place deal chiefly with theology and sectarian theories. 10. There can be no doubt, however, that in (5) His comparative grammar of the modern Aryan languages of India, p. 89. (6) His Essays in thirteen volumes, Vol. 4, p. 183."], [321, "287 Fine Arts Music. Tanjore, owing to the lengthened duration of the Hindu Government which patronized it more or less, the cultivation of Sanskrit has survived much longer, and its knowledge is now more generally prevalent than anywhere else in the south. There were in former days many distinguished scholars. The famous minister of the Nayak Raja, Vijaya Raghava, in the first half of the seventeenth century, named Gdvinda Dikshit, was a profound scholar. Much more recently, Bava Pandit, the minister of the last Mahratta Raja, Sivaji, (died in 1843) was a distin guished scholar, as was also his contemporary, the English Secretary of the Raja, Devaji Rao. The judges of the Courts of Judicature were generally men learned in general literature as well as in Dharma Castras. Ancl some of the famous native doctors attached to the Baja's Court (Brahmans of course) were deeply learned in Sanskrit literature. Even now, not a few learned Brahmans are to be found in the district, more particularly in the \" Sarvamaniyam\" C) villages along the Cauvery. Latterly, however, the cultivation of Sanskrit has been gradually declining and is now hardly cared for by any classes of natives. 11. Reference has been made to poetry under the preceding head. Of native Musical art, Tanjore has been perhaps the only seat, properly so called, south of the Krishtna (Kistna), since the fall of the Hindu empire of Vijayanagar. If it has found patronage in the Courts of Mysore and Travan c re, it went there from (Tanjore. It does not appear to what extent music had been cultivated in Tanjore in previous times ; but the most famous (7) This means wholly tax-free. This was the tenure on which grants of land were made by the native rulers. The personal grants of this class have been enfranchised under the Inam Rules by which they.are now subject to the payment of a quit-rent to Government."], [322, "288 native musicians of Tanjore are those who arose since the accession of Raja Sarabhoji to the titular dignity of the musnud and the cession of the district to the British at the end of the last century. The stipendiary life of the Raja and his court, with a liberal provision for the maintenance of state and dignity, and with, at the same time, perfect freedom from all cares of Government or the troubles of war, was most favorable for the cultivation of taste and luxury. 12. For a full and scientific description of native music, reference may be had to Sir William Jones' works, (vol. 4, pages 166 \u2014 210.) The systems of native music current in Tanjore have been two : the Kama tak ancl Hindustani ; the former denoting purely native music and the latter the form of music introduced from Northern India with the refinements introduced into it from Persia. Karnatak is the name which the Mahomedans of the Dakhan applied indis criminately to the whole country south of the Krishtna, apparently from that having been the language spoken in the country immediately adjoin ing, as well as in the court of Vijayanagar, and it has been adopted from them by natives to designate native arts and fashions in general in distinction from those introduced by Mahomedans ancl Europeans and generally everything that is foreign to the south. Thus the term is used as an opposite alike of Hindustani, Mogul (moulded into Mogalayi as an adjective) and English. Obviously, the Karnatak music itself came originally from northern India (for it is not likely that any music worth the name existed in the south before the arrival of the Aryans), and the corruption which it has undergone since its first introduction by reason of its distance from its original source on the one hand, and the"], [323, "289 Vocal Music In. strnmental Music. refinement which it latterly received in northern India by association with Persian music on the other-, consti tute the difference between the Karnatak ancl Hindu stani music. Of course, there has been a gradual fusion of the one into the other; but the main points of difference between the two are still well marked, and the two systems continue to be distinct. The Hindustani music is more esteemed than the country music, not because the latter is at all deficient in natural or plaintive melody, but because it is less refined ancl less concentrated. 13. Vocal music of course holds the first rank. The musical instruments in ordinary use at singing parties, both Karnatak and Hindustani, are: \u2014 (1) Tambdra, a stringed instrument with chords of metal, sounded lightly and uniformly with the forefinger of the right hand, merely for keeping the tune. (2) Sarangi, also a stringed instrument ; this is fitted with chords of silk and is played upon with a bow. (3) Sarbat (pronounced also Sara vat), fitted with strings as No. 2 and struck with a pointed bit of ivory or wood. (4) Mridang called in Tamil Mattalam, a small drum, of which a description will be found under the head of Nach music. All these together, with vocal music, form a complete set. No. 1 is indispensable for a singing party ; No. 4 is often dispensed with ; either or both of 2 and 3 are now generally superseded by the English violin which is sometimes added to them both. Nos. 2 and 3 are Hindustani instruments, but they are used also in the Karnatak system of music, which"], [324, "290 Nkch Music, has no stringed instrument save the one for keeping the tune (Tambdra) and the Indian lyre, the well known Vina. This last which is common to both systems, while it holds the highest rank by common consent, is, owing to its delicate sound, played upon by itself alone. 14. The above description does not include the Nach music called Cmnamelam or the native Band known as \" Periyamelam\" (big music). The per formers of these two kinds constitute, as stated in Chap. Ill, a distinct caste called \" Melakkarajati,\" which is held in low repute ; but as this is the music commonly met with in this country, a detailed des cription of it seems necessary. 15. The \" Cinnamelam\" or dancingmusic consists of a small drum, a bagpipe, a flute and two pairs of cymbals to regulate time, to which last are adjusted the movements of the dancer. These instruments are called respectively: \u2014 Mattalam Turutti Pillankulal Talam To these is now very generally added a violin, and in the towns of Tanjore and Madras an English flute is substituted for the native one. The drum is of a cylindrical shape, a little thicker in the middle than at the ends, and is covered with skin at either end, the sound on one differing in key from that on the other. The performer plays on the drum with his fingers. On one side (the left) the strokes are mere slaps, the fingers remaining unit ed ; on the other each finger plays severally produc ing a succession of sharp strokes. The bag-pipe keeps up an unbroken continuous sound adjusted to the key-note of the whole chord."], [325, "291 The native flute is a single pipe, a small narrow one of bamboo, with holes corresponding to the Gamut. It produces a gentle and melodious sound, but is difficult to play upon, owing to the effort of the lungs it requires. Each pair of cymbals consists of two small thick pieces of bell-metal, slightly hallowed in the centre, so as to resemble a shallow cup ; the one being struck with the other. At every dance, the training master, with one of the pairs of cymbals in his hands, stands behind the dancing woman on one side and first repeats the piece or song after which the woman dances ; he keeps time throughout. Another performer stands on the other side merely striking the cymbals in correspondence with the dancing master. Both these men, with one or two more behind, (often a female of the dancing woman class) accompany the music with their voices. 16. \" Periyamelam\" consists of a native clarionet (often a pair played upon in exact correspondence with each other) called Nagasaram;(8) a pipe resembling it in form to keep the time, a drum called -Tavul ; and a pair of cymbals. In this music, the drum is of a larger size, shaped like an English drum, and produces a deeper sound than the mattalam. It is struck on one side with a short stick much like on English drum; on the other played on with the fingers. The cymbals are flat and larger in size. This music, owing to its loud and deep sound, does not admit of any vocal accompaniment. The \"Periyamelam\" is indispensable at daily ceremonies, as well as periodical festivals, in temples, and at all marriages and other festivals of more than ordinary (8) Vulgarly \" Nayanam.\""], [326, "292 Painting and other Miscellaneous. importance in private houses. The \" Cinnamelam\" or dancing music is not so ; in temples- it is restricted to annual ancl other periodical festivals and other particular days ; in private houses, it is only at marriages of rich people that nauches are held. 17. In Tanjore, music, both vocal and instru mental, unconnected with the \" Cinnamelam\" or \" Periyamelam,\" has been always held in esteem socially, and both have been practised from mere taste by men in high stations of life. English Subba Rau, one of the early Devans of Travancore, a Tanjore Mahratta Brahman (he was called English Subba Bau because he was the first distinguished English scholar in the south) was a great proficient in instrumental music. Pratapsing, the son of the deposed Raja Amarsing, was an accomplished musical scholar. In fact, the practice of Vina was in former clays the favorite amusement of the native Aristocracy and was regarded as an accom plishment. Musical art has however now ceased to be patronized and, as must be expected, has considerably deteriorated in quality. Of native music generally, it seems sufficient to note, that it is of all native arts the least known to Europeans. The following passage, which Elphinstone, in his History of India, quotes from the Oriental Quarterly Magazine for December 1825, (vol. I, p. 298), aptly describes the difference between the cultivated Indian music and that which is ordinarily met with. \" We may add, that the only native singers and players whom Europeans are in the way of hearing, in most parts of India, are regarded by their scientific brethren in much the same light as a ballad- singer at the corner of the street by the primo soprano of the Italian Opera.\" 18. This art was also cultivated to a considerable extent in the city of Tanjore during the days of the"], [327, "293 Native Hygiene, Mahratta Rajas ; but it has now greatly declined. Pith figures and flower garlands and nosegays in a great variety of shapes still continue to be made with considerable skill as well as taste. The latter even now constitutes the occupation of a numerous class, called \" Pukkarars\" (literally flower dealers), who give name to a large street called \" Pukkarat teru\" in the outside town south of the fort of Tan- jore, where they reside and cultivate native flowers of all varieties, chiefly jasmin. Carving in metal is done perhaps nowhere in India so neatly or taste fully as in Tanjore. Carpets of silk floss, which are made by the weavers of the \" Pattunulkarar\" class in the towns of Tanjore and Aiyamp.ttei are much approved in England. Native musical instru ments made by the carpenters of the town of Tanjore are valued everywhere. 19. During the days of the Mahratta Rajas, and more especially in the time of His Highness Sarab hoji, the native medical science was cultivated with much care. The study of the theory as well as practice was encouraged under royal patronage, and medicines believed to be of high virtue, were pre pared in the palace itself at immense cost of labor and money. European ideas, as well as medicines, were introduced to a considerable extent. The pro fessional native physicians in the town of Tanjore have always enjoyed a reputation for the mildness of their treatment ; so that at least the prevailing opinion that much mischief is done by the native practitioners administering strong and deliterious drugs does not apply to them. They no doubt in a measure enforce a strict dietary ; but they do not ignore the importance of nourishment. It is only in cases of violent fevers and under certain con ditions with respect both to the symptoms of the 38"], [328, "294 complaint and the constitution of the patient, that they enjoin total abstention, but never beyond the first twenty-four hours of the attack. They gene rally use European medicines, more especially quinine, epsom salts, jalap, rhubarb, calomel, blue-pill, James' powder, grey powder, chlorodyne and peppermint. The chief native drugs, which they ordinarily use, are, among mineral substances, various preparations of mercury, sulphur, cinnabar, iron, and magnet. Among vegetable substances ; pepper, ginger, cum min seed, anise-seed, raisins, as also : \u2014 Kadukkay (fruit of the Terminalia chebula). Sittarattei (alpinia galanga minor). Tippili (piper longum). Kandankattiri (solanum jacquini). Atimadhuram (licorice). Kdshtam (costus arabicus). Senna (cassia lanciolata) . Avarei (cassia auriculata). Sivaduveru (convolvulus.) Kodiveli (Plumbago Zeylanica). Nilavembu (Andrographis paniculata). Karusalanganni (Eclipta erecta). Musummusikkei (Bryonia scabra). Kuppamani (Acalypha Indica). Nannari (Periploca Indicus). Sittamutti (Pavonia Zeylanica). Mavalingam (crataeva nurvala). Vishtnukranti (evolvulus alsinoides). The mode of treatment, as well as the nature of the medicine in use, in the rural parts of the district is more in keeping with the prevailing practice in other parts of the Presidency, though perhaps not altogether so rude. (For indigenous medicinal plants, see list given in the Chapter (IV) on Flora.)"], [329, "295 Railway PART II. CHAPTER X. MEANS OF COMMUNICATION; TRADE AND COMMERCE; WEIGHTS AND MEASURES ; RATES OF INTEREST ON BORROWED MONEY, &c. 1 . The district is abundantly provided with means of communication. It is traversed by two branches of the South Indian Railway, one running along its entire length (66 miles) to Negapatam on the coast, ancl the other branching off from it at Tanjore and running (62 miles) in a north-easterly direction. Thus, with the exception of the two comparatively poorly cultivated and thinly populated taluks on the south, viz., Tiruttureipundi and Pattukkdttei, all parts of the district have the benefit of Railway com munication. The two main lines (Negapatam to Tuticorin and Tanjore to Madras), open for traffic, have varied in length within the last four years ; the goods traffic between Tanjore and other districts during the second half of the year 1877, during which they were open throughout, with only a break of 19 miles between Shiyali and Porto Novo, is shown below. It may be observed here that it is chiefly for passenger traffic that the lines of the Railway are ordinarily used.

The total number is stated elsewhere in the same publi cation (p. 350) as about four hundred, and this does not seem to be at all an over-statement. All these were built between the years 1833 and 1856. The largest are : the one over the Grand Anicut, the Coleroon bridge at Aneikkaran Chatram, and the bridges over the two branches of the same river at the Lower Anikat. The first was built in 1839 and consists of thirty arches of 32 feet span. Being adapted to the old native work on which it is built, it is narrow and winding. The bridge over the Coleroon at Aneikkaran Chatram is a noble work ; it consists of 40 elliptical arches of 50 feet span and its entire length from wing to wing is 2,424 feet ; this work was designed by Colonel E. Laws ord, then Superintending Engineer of the Division, and was constructed in 1855 and 1856, nnder the personal superintendence of Mr. W. M. Cadell, who was then Sub-Collector and for many years afterwards Collector of this district. The bridges over the two branches of the Coleroon at the Lower Anikat were built about the same time. It seems sufficient to mention two more which may be regarded as types of the great majority. They are the five bridges across the Vennaru and the Cauvery on the road from Tanjore to Tiruvaiyaru. The first has five arches of 58 feet span, and was built in 1836 ; the second has nine arches, the central 55 feet with 11 feet rise, and the side arches 50, 45, 40 and 35 feet/1) The cost of these two as also of the bridges across the Vettaru (1) The dimensions have been taken from Pharoah and Co.'s Gazetteer, page 350."], [334, "300 and the Kudamuratti, (all the four standing within a distance of four miles between Tanjore and Tiruvaiy aru) was borne by the late Raja. Tunnels over smaller water courses, as might be expected from the net work of irrigation and drainage channels which cover the Cauvery delta, are almost countless. 4. As shown under the head of Local Funds Administration (Chapter I of this Part), the total amount available for expenditure on district communi cations in the year 1876-77 was Rs. 2,74,900, and the actual outlay, including the cost of supervision, Rs. 1,97,310. The total number of miles of road kept in repair in that year was 1,1 71s, and the total outlay distributed over them gave an average of Rs. 167 per mile. Besides these, the length of road maintained by Municipalities within the limits of towns was 33, and the aggregate outlay on them Rs. 31,381. The total of miles of road kept up was thus 1,204^, and the total outlay on them Rs. 2,28,691. 5. The laterite rocks which exist in the south western portion of the district furnish excellent material for roads ; but in the delta, alluvial soil is alone available. This, however, provided some care is exercised in the selection of the material, that is good stiff clay, (generally procurable within a short distance), is used with a covering of river sand, makes very fair roads for the ordinary bullock cai 't traffic. The river sand is collected before the freshes come down and stored along the roads to be spread over them during the rainy season when they get miry. 6.

In other Municipal towns, the more important roads have been metalled with laterite procured from the Tanjore neighbourhood, and besides these, several of the roads which serve as feeders to the railway have been metalled also in a similar manner. The other district roads are generally in good condition in dry weather, but difficult for traffic in the rainy season. In the delta, they are, as a rule, raised sufficiently above the level of the iuundated lands ; but in the Pattukottei taluk in the south, they are low and have no bridges for the nullahs or jungle streams which they cross and some of which are uns ordable for a whole day after a heavy fall of rain. 7.

Looking into the Rail- way traffic, it is observed that, in the year 1875, the quantity of cloths carried from, was 88*72 tons against 36P47 tons brought into, Tanjore; so that the consumption of the district cannot be less and (2) The latest year for which the statistics are available is 1876-77, but in that year the ordinary course of trade was disturbed by famine, and therefore the statistics of the preceding year have been taken."], [340, "306 Other principal articles. must be more than what is deducible from the statistics of the sea-borne trade. It must moreover be remembered, that Manchester piece goods come into Tanjore also by land from Madras. Altogether, seven lakhs of rupees do not seem to be an over estimate of the consumption of the district. Assuming the value of country-made piece goods locally consumed to be, say, two lakhs of rupees, and adding it to the value of those exported ; the total representing the outturn of loom work in the dis trict would be : \u2014 Rs. 2,00,000 + 6,06,280 = 8,06,280. Taking the value of piece goods manufactured from imported twist and yarn at double the value of the material, or say, Rs. 3,80,000, the remainder repre senting the value of work turned' out from country material would be Rs. 4,26,280 or, say, four lakhs. How the raw material worked into cloths is pro cured will be seen under the head of Manufactures further on. No cotton is imported by sea, and in the ten years from 1867-68 to 1876-77, it was only in one, viz. 1876-77, that a small quantity (value Rs. 4,520) was exported. 10. Metals are imported partly through Ceylon and partly straight from Europe ; in the latter case they are imported into the French Port of Kareik kal, whence they pass inland to Combaconum, the principal seat of manufacture of metal wares in this part of the south. Of timber, teak wood comes from Burmah, and Palmyra and other woods from Ceylon. Of betel-nuts, those cut into slices and boiled, called \" Kalippakku,\" and the large sized raw-nuts cut in halves, called \" Vettuppulagu,\" come from Singa pore, Malacca and Acheen, and the smaller raw nuts from Colombo. The quantity imported in 1875-76"], [341, "307 Rice and Paddy, was no less than 3,374 tons.(3> Pegu ponies are imported from Moulmein annually, and Negapatam is one of the chief depots for them on the Coroman dal coast. A considerable item which appears under the head of imports is Railway stores ; but it is to a great extent casual, and the lines of the South In dian Railway being now completed, future imports must be restricted chiefly to rolling stock and ma chinery. 11. The comparative cheapness of Bengal rice accounts for its being at all imported into Tanjore, the granary of Southern India and the food market of Ceylon ; but in the years 1876-77 and 1877-78, its imports increased very largely on account of the famine, which prevailed in the districts inland ; in 1877, the railway carried no less than 121,196 tons of rice and paddy from Tanjore to Trichinopoly, Madura, Coimbatore and to the Madras Railway. The imports from Bengal and the exports to Ceylon, of rice, paddy and other grains, for ten years from 1867-68 to 1876-77, are shown in the subjoined table ; the quantities as also detail as to the descrip tion of grain are not ascertainable for earlier years.

Tranquebar in former times carried on a considerable amount of trade with the Mauri tius, Penang, Batavia and Ceylon, but has declined latterly as explained in the first chapter of this Part. Muttuppettei and Ativiraraman Pattanam, with the advantage of a protected Bay, as already stated, carry on an export trade in rice and an import trade in betelnuts and timber all the year round. 14. Of the inland trade of the district by rail, all available information has been given under the head of means of communication. It may be observ ed, however, that it consists mainly of exports of salt, and, in times of scarcity, of rice and paddy. The imports consist of dry grains, ghee, vegetable oils, tamarind, chillies and oil seeds, of which the local produce falls short of the wants of the large population of this district. There is no record of the inland traffic by the common road ; but except"], [345, "311 Rates of interest on borrowed money. Weights and mea sures \u2014 Weights. in years of scarcity, when large quantities of paddy are carried southward into the Tondaman's and the Marava countries, there is hardly any export traffic otherwise than by rail ; neither is there any import traffic by the common road, except in ploughing cattle, milch cows and buffaloes, for the supply of which the district is dependent, as already mention ed, chiefly on other districts. Formerly, there was a considerable amount of boat traffic by the Cauvery/4) in provisions of the descriptions above given ; but it has been now almost entirely superseded by the Railway. 15. In small transactions, where jewels or other valuable articles are given in pawn as security, the rate generally charged is from 6 to 12 per cent, per annum ; in all other cases it varies from ] 2 to 24 per cent. In large transactions, money is rarely lent otherwise than upon the security of landed or house property, and the rate of interest varies from 6 to 12 percent. ; the maximum being allowed, however, only in rare cases. Advances to agricultural laborers, (always small) are made only on personal security, and generally without interest ; the interest, where it is charged, never exceeding 12 per cent, per annum. These advances, however, are not unfrequently lost by the laborers emigrating to Ceylon or the Straits or otherwise failing to work them out. WEIGHTS AND MEASUP.ES. 16. The weights in use in Tanjore, as well for coarse as for fine weighments, are adjusted to the Madras maund of 960 tolas. (1.) The boats used are the circular ones called \" Parisel.\" They are made of laths or splinters of bamboos covered with skin, and are 12 to 15 feet in diameter ; they draw 18 inches of water and can-y from 4 to 5 tons of loads.\u2014 (Pharoah _ Co.'s Gazetteer of Southern India, p. 350)."], [346, "312 GOLDSMITH'S WEIGHT.

The seed, however, is now hardly ever used, and so the Fanam, a silver coin now not current, equal in weight to one-ninth of a Pagoda. The Pagoda weight equal to 54 grs., divided into fractions, descending by fours to one thirty-second, is practically the unit of Gold smith's as well as commercial transactions. It repre sents the weight of a gold coin, which is likewise now not current. Whatever may have been the difference in the standard weights of these two coins (Fanam and Pagoda) as they prevailed in different provinces, and whatever the difference in the stand ards of weight now represented by the term Pagoda in the different districts of this Presidency ; in Tan jore there is none between the standards in use in jewellers' and commercial transactions. MEASURES OF CAPACITY. 18. The measure of the lowest denomination is \"Padi,\" supposed to be equal to, but slightly exceeding the measure in use at Madras known as \"Pattanam Padi.\" In the greater part of the district, the recognized capacity of the \" Padi\" heaped (this being the mode of measuring in vogue in this district) in first sort rice is 133 tolas, and its equivalent in Government seers of 80 tolas 1'66 or 3i lbs.<6> 2 of these Padis = 1 Marakkal 12 Marakkals = 1 Kalam. The Kalam is only a nominal measure, and it is the next lower, Marakkal, that is actually used for (6) At the experiments made in 1872, the cubic contents of the Padis in use at the different bazaar stations in the district varied from 1022 4 to 106-57 inches, and the diameters from 4'65 to 5\"3 inches. The diameter of a Padi of recognized standard is 4J inches, and the quantity of rice held in the heap over the rim, according to the table given in Board's Pro ceedings, dated 15th January 1873, is ll tolas. Deducting this from the recognized standard of the contents in rice, i.e., 133 tolas ; the remainder, viz., the contents of the measure struck in rice is 122 tolas; the normal contents of the Madras measure in rice are 120 tolas."], [348, "314 measuring grains. Ordinarily, all grains in husk aro measured by Marakkal ; while those husked are measured by Padi. Smaller measures corresponding to fractions of Padi down to yV are in use. On the eastern sea board, as also in some of the inland towns nearer the coast, the Padi in use as the measure of the lowest denomination is a half of the ordinary Padi. In the taluks of Mannargudi and Pattukdttei, the standard of the Padi is 144 tolas and that of the Marakkal its double. 1 9. The relative weights in Government Seers of other commodities to 1st sort rice in the town of Tanjore have been determined by the Board of Revenue to be as follow : \u2014 Govt. Seers. Rice, lst sort ... ... 1'66 \u201e 2nd sort P67 Paddy, lst sort 1-29 \u201e 2nd sort 1'29 Horse gram ... ... 1*75 Cholum I -59 Cumbu 1-45 Varugu 1-48 Ragi 1-51 Wheat 1-47 Ulundu 1-68 Salt 1-84 20. It will be seen that the Kalam, the measure of the highest denomination (equal to 24 Padis) in use in the greater part of the district, contains in rice 39*84 Government Seers or just '16 Seers short an Indian Maund, and in paddy 30*96 Govt. Seers ; the relative weight of paddy to rice being thus about three to four, that is, bulk for bulk, paddy weighs about three-fourths of rice.

For all purposes of approxi mate calculation, a given number of Tanjore Kalams of rice may be taken at as many Indian Maunds; more exactly it is 821fTlbs.

All ordinary native manufactures are carried on in this district, and those for which the district is particularly noted are metal wares, silk cloths, silk carpets and pith work. The dyeing of cotton yarn and cloths is also carried on to a considerable extent.

Kdmadu is the place where the cloths of com- bined silk and cotton texture known by the general name of \" Kdrnadu cloths\" are made. They are made exclusively by the class of weavers called Caliyars."], [351, "317 The cotton yarn which they use is partly imported and partly home-made; but it is all dyed in this country with those durable dark-blue and red colors, which alone meet the tastes of the general body of their customers who as a rule reject the color of Turkey red cloths and European chintzes as over-gaudy and suitable only for the vulgar. The red yarn is dyed exclusively at Kdrnadu with the bark of the roots of nuna (Morinda citrifolia) and the dark blue yarn is procured chiefly from South Arcot. For the red color, the Komadu weavers prefer country yarn, as the imported yarn is supposed not to take that dye quite as well. The silk for weaving, they obtain from Pattunulkarars. The trade of the Kornadu weavers is likewise in a flourishing state, as imported piece goods of Manchester or other manufacture offer no suitable substitute for the clothes they make, which are what are ordinarily worn by women of the higher classes. Neither have the Kornadu cloths much competition to struggle against from native looms in other parts of India ; for no other manufacturers combine all the required conditions ; the Madura cloths are thin and not durable ; the cloths of Con jeveram and Arni are too heavy, while the silk threads with which they are interlaced are deficient in deli cacy as well as gloss ; the Benares cloths, when at all durable, are much too expensive. Formerly, the use of Kornadu cloths was almost entirely restricted to the Tanjore Brahmans; but now that Brahmanical customs are adopted generally by other higher classes and the inland traffic has been so much facilitated by Railways ; these cloths find a market to a greater or less extent all over the south between the latitudes of Madras and Cape Comorin. 26. The weavers of the Caliyar class in certain other places endeavor to imitate the K6rnadu manu- 41"], [352, "318 factures, but do not quite succeed by reason appar ently of their not having found out the secret of producing exactly the colors that are required. 27. With these exceptions, the weaving trade in Tanjore has considerably declined owing to the or dinary white cloths of country manufacture having been displaced to a great extent by cheap Manchester piece goods. Grey shirtings, grey jaconets and bleached mulls now supply the ordinary clothing of the whole native male population, with the exception of the lowest classes ; the local weaving industry, so far as grey or white goods are concerned, being restricted to coarse cloths for these classes as well as for export to Ceylon and other colonies and to those superior cloths laced with silk and gold threads of which, however, the consumption is necessarily small. Even the garments of women of non-Brahmanical castes are made up to a considerable extent of Turkey red cloths and European prints. 28. No doubt, as has been seen from the statis tics of trade, a large quantity of cloths continues to be manufactured by country looms, and the fact is borne out also by a return obtained in 1877-78, which shows the number of looms in the district to be 15,406 and the number of men employed in work ing them 30,839. But considering the obviously large consumption of Europe piece goods everywhere, it is difficult to suppose that the country manufac ture is kept up to the same extent as when there were little or no imports of cotton fabrics from Eu rope. Manufacturing industry is of no recent deve- lopment in Tanjore. The Commissioners in their report, dated 31st January 1799, say : \u2014^ \" The per fection to which the manufactures are brought makes the demand for them very general : they consist of (8) Appendix, page 23."], [353, "319 all the different kinds of cloths in use among the natives and those best calculated for the Madras and Europe markets of a variety of silk and cotton car pets, many of which are also exported and from the general resort of merchants and brokers from Mad ras, the country benefits essentially from most of its return being made in specie.\" At any rate, the out turn of country looms is not anything like what the district with its increased population and wealth might be expected to require in' the absence of im ports of foreign goods. 29.

The country yarn is spun almost wholly from raw material procured from the adjacent dis tricts, the quantity grown in the district being very small. The dyeing materials used are indigo for Dyeing materials, dark-blue color and chiefly \" Nuna\" for red color. \"llaoau The latter is grown in the district in more or less sufficient quantities ;(9) but of indigo, a con siderable portion comes from the country north of the Colleroon ; the produce of the district being limited. The Commissioners' report above quoted shows that, at its date, the district produced a sufficiency of this plant, but such is not the case now. Another substance used for the red dye is the root of Imbura (hedyotis umbellata), a small imb__ plant known in the official language as chayroot, which grows wild and is also cultivated to a small extent in the sandy tracts on the coast. (10) The production and consumption of this commodity are alike limited.

Quality of the 30_ -j^g cl0ths made in Tanjore are not remark textile manufactures u able for nicety of texture ; but the Pattunulkarars possess much skill in preparing and dyeing silk; they supply the native population at a moderate cost with silk of a very fair quality and durable colours sufficient to meet their wants. It is this class of weavers who make the fine carpets of silk floss, in which there was an export trade so long back as 1799/11) The raw silk comes chiefly by land from Madras, and is known as Bengal silk ; it is appa- rently to a great extent the produce of China. Mats- 31. The only other manufacture which requires notice is that of mats made of a kind of cyperus. These are made in many places in the district ; but t^ose noted for quality of texture are made at Aiyampettei and Shiyali by the Mahomedans of the Labbe class. The Shiyali mats are nearly as good as those of Palghat, and much cheaper. At Poreiyaru, mats of fair quality are made by the same class of people of the leaves of Talei (Pandanus odoratissimus), and they bear the same relation to Ceylon mats made of the same material that the Shiyali mats bear to the Palghat mats. nufocTurlTof^tSte 32- Tlie miscellaneous manufactures of taste and and luxury. luxury, such as pith toys, flower garlands and nosegays and native musical instruments, which are carried on by the comparatively small remnant of the body of workmen who were employed during the days of the Rajas have been touched on under the head of Fine Arts.

It is the most thickly populated and contains the smallest proportion of uncultivated area in the Madras Presidency.

This district, to a considerable extent, escaped those destructive and continuous wars which, in the course of the last century, desolated almost every other part of the south.

Near the western limit of Tanjore, about 17 miles from the bifurcation of the Cauvery and the Colleroon, the two main streams (1) The correct spelling is said to be \" Koleiidam,\" signifying a place of slaughter. (2) The Cauvery proper and the Vennaru are the two great arms, into which the Cauvery, after the separation of the Colleroon, divides itself. Of the other channels above enumerated, Nos. 7, 8 and 9 are the branches of the Cauvery, and 6, 10, 11, and 12 those of the Vennaru."], [362, "328 come into close contact with each other, forming between them what is called the island of Sriran gam, and at this point, where the bed of the Colle roon is 9 or 10 feet lower, this work, a masonry dam, stands across a natural outlet of the Cauvery channel and prevents its waters being wholly drawn off into the Colleroon . 3. Col. Baird Smith, of the Bengal Engineers, in his report on the Cauvery, Krishna and Godavari Anikats, refers to a tradition which assigns to the Grand Anikat a date corresponding to the close of the second century A. D.(a); but it is probably a work of a later date though perhaps not later than the eleventh century. It originally consist- ed of a solid mass of rough stones, 1,080 feet in length, 40 to 60 in breadth, and 15 to 18 in depth, stretching across the whole width of the outlet in a serpentine form. In the year 1804, Capt. Caldwell of the Engineers raised it consider- ably, supplying uprights of cut-stone to facilitate the formation of a temporary earthen bank to retain more water when required, and later on, in 1830, it was provided with ten under-sluices at the eastern extremity to allow of the escape of sand(X In 1839, an arched bridge was constructed over this work, as the main road from Salem to Trichinopoly through Mayaveram and Combaconum, passes over it. 4. It was, however, not long after Tanjore became part of the British territory, that it was discovered that the Colleroon, from its more rapid fall and more direct course to the sea, was drawing (3) pp. 3 and 13. (4) When the body of the dam was cut through for the construction of the under-sluices, it was discovered for the first time, that the stones of which it was composed had been laid in clay. In the words of Colonel Baird Smith, \" the old dam had effectually withstood the floods of 1,600 years by the mere inertia of its materials,\" (Ibid, pages 12 and 13.)"], [363, "329 an unduly large share of water ; while the Cauvery branch was deteriorating by the formation of deposits at its head ; and so early as 1804, Capt. Caldwell recorded his opinion that, \" if effective measures were not adopted to rectify, by artificial means, the natural differences between the two branches, the inevitable issue must be the annihilation of the Cauvery as an irrigating stream and, as a conse quence thereof, the total ruin of Tanjore.\" For nearly 25 years from that date, says Colonel Baird Smith, \" an incessant struggle was maintained against the increasing tendency of the river bed to silt up the head, and many parts of the channel were periodically cleared of deposits by manual labor; long and expensive embankments were carried across the bed of the main stream, so as to force a larger supply of water into the Cauvery branch. All these efforts, however, were ineffectual \u2014 the bed continued to rise, the supply to diminish, the extent of land under irrigation yearly decreased, the revenue was falling off, and the condition of the people was visibly becoming worse and worse.\" 5. In 1830, simultaneously with the construction of under-sluices in the Grand Anikat, similar means for clearing the bed of the Cauvery of accumulations of sand were provided in the shape of under-sluices and waste weirs at other eligible sites on the left bank of the Cauvery. But, although these works proved beneficial in answering their particular purpose, the evil resulting from the unequal distribution of the volume between the two main streams remained unchecked until the construction at the head of the Colleroon, in 1836, of the great work known as the \" Upper Anikat,\" which has associated the name of Sir Arthur Cotton of the Royal Engineers with the agricultural prosperity of Tanjore."], [364, "330 Upper Colleroon Anikat. Cauvery Eegulat ing Dam. 6. This work, a dam of brick masonry capped with cut stone to a depth of one foot, in its original con struction, was 750 yards long divided by two small islands in the river bed into three parts, of which the one at the northern end was 74' and the other two were 5' 4\" high. Its thickness throughout was 6 feet, and it was provided with twenty-two sluices, each 2 feet in width by 3^ in height. The waterway thus provided for scoring out the bed, which amount ed in total width to only 44 feet, was, however, subsequently found to be much too inadequate; heavy deposits and sand banks having been formed in the Colleroon above the dam. In 1843, therefore, upon the recommendation of Colonel Sim, the sluices were enlarged, giving a total width of clearance waterway equal to 129^ feet, and at the same time, the central portion of the dam was lowered two feet on a length of 700 feet. 7. The above work was followed by the construc tion, in 1845, of a regulating dam across the Cauvery branch to counteract the effects of the Colleroon anikat which, it was found, was throwing into it a body of water far larger than could be allowed to enter it with safety to Tanjore. This latter dam, 650 yards in length, is divided into three portions of which the central has its crown on a level with the river bed ; while the one on either side is raised from 12 to 18 inches above it. This work was likewise suggested by Colonel Sim and was carried out by Colonel (then Captain) Lawford, the Superin tending Engineer of the Division, to whose untiring energy and attention to the details of the conservancy of Irrigation during a career of twelve years, Tanjore in a great measure owes its present prosperity. 8. In the following year (1846) a foot bridge"], [365, "331 Lower Colleroon Anikat. was constructed by Colonel Lawford over the entire length of the Colleroon dam. 9. Almost simultaneously with the Colleroon dam, was designed and carried out by Colonel Cotton, as supplementary to it, another work in the Colleroon, about 70 miles lower clown, known as \" the Lower Anikat.\" The obstruction of so large a portion of the water, which the Colleroon was drawing, would, as a necessary consequence, have lowered its surface level, thereby depriving of their irrigation the lands which depended on it in the district of South Arcot. The primary object, therefore, of the \" Lower Anikat\" was to ensure their due share of water supply to these lands. But advantage was taken at the same time to provide a supply of water from the Colleroon for the north-eastern portion of Tanjore, which was either beyond the influence, or was indifferently supplied by the tail ends, of the Cauvery channels. Accordingly, the spot where an island divides the Colleroon into two branches, was selected ; a dam, with suitable vents for the passage of boats as well as the escape of sand, was constructed across each branch, and a channel was taken off from each, one for South Arcot under the designation of \" North Rajan Vayakkal\" and the other for Tanjore under that of \" South Rajan Vayak kal.\" This work was largely extended in 1856-57 and the following years and was provided at the same time with a bridge for general traffic for the Trunk Road No. IX which passes over it. A portion of this Anikat having subsequently fallen, it was restored at a considerable cost in the course of six years,' 1863 to 1868. 10. The Vennaru regulating dam was construct- other regulating ed in the year 1 848 by Colonel E . La wf ord. The rest of the regulating dams, except No. 13, were designed"], [366, "332 by Major Meade and carried out under the direction of Colonel Oakes, the Superintending Engineer, in 1867-68 and the following years. No. 13, \" Kacca mangalam Anikat,\" is an ancient native work of which the origin is not known. It is a stone dam across the Vennaru at the point where the chan nel called \" Pilleivayakkal\" branches out from its south and the one called \" Anandankaveri\" from its north bank. 11. While thus the general system of irrigation has been regulated and brought under control ; the arrangements for the distribution of the supply in detail have not yet been perfected. During the period of more than thirty years which have elapsed since the system of head-works was completed, much has been done in the way of providing head-sluices for minor channels of supply and calingulahs or waste weirs for surplus vents ; but at the same time much remains to be done towards a complete utiliza tion of the available supply of water, as well as the perfection of drainage arrangements in detail. On an average, two lakhs of rupees are spent annually on new works and repairs under the head of \" Agri culture\";(5) but this is hardly sufficient to meet the wants of a vast system of Irrigation like that of the Cauvery delta. The embankments of the numerous offtakes of the Cauvery, which traverse the delta, are generally in good repair ; but the conser vancy of the countless smaller channels of supply and discharge is not adequately provided for.

The various items of the cost of the Upper Anikat, as also that of the Cauvery dam, have been taken as they appear in the district re cords of the Revenue department. There has been some confusion in the division of the expenditure on the Lower Anikat works between Tanjore and South Arcot, and the first five items, therefore, have been taken as given in Colonel Baird Smith's report on the Cauvery, Krishtna and G6davari Anikats. II. Colonel Baird Smith gives the cost of the Upper Anikat and Cauvery dam together down to 1849 as Rs. 3,55,782 ; wmile the sums given in the above table for both come up to only Rs. 2,37,708. The difference is due to that officer's statement including ordinary repairs and also the cost (Rs. 15,599) of the new head given to the channel which supplies the lands in the Trichinopoly district and is a distinct work. In like manner, the expen diture on the Lower Anikat down to 1850 as given by Colonel Smith is increased by reason of its includ ing \" various improvements to the works dependent on the dam between 1838 and 1850,\" which proba bly include ordinary repairs and also by the item for the main southern channel of distribution as given"], [369, "335 by that Officer being made up of a moiety of the original cost of the Anikat, while the whole of it is given by him at the same time as a separate item. III. In previous discussions on the \" direct and indirect effects\" of the Colleroon Anikats, the original cost of she Lower Anikat was divided between Tan jore and South Arcot in equal moieties ; but no such division has been made of the very large subsequent outlay on construction. To avoid complications, it has been considered best to give here the entire cost from the first of the Anikat as well as of the south ern channel (South Kajanvayakkal) and other works on the right bank of the Colleroon ; leaving out only such as have been carried out on the South Arcot side for the exclusive benefit of that district ; so that in framing a Capital and P.evenue Account, the South Arcot expenditure as well as South Arcot revenue may be merely added to the similar statistics of Tanjore. The South Arcot revenue being much larger, the division of the Anikat outlay in equal moieties does not seem to be quite correct. 13. The preparation of the annual Capital and Revenue accounts of these works is attended with considerable difficulty ; it has been the subject of much discussion, but a final conclusion yet remains to be arrived at. 14. First as regards the capital outlay, each Anikat, more especially the upper Anikat, can be regarded as only a part, an important part no doubt, of a vast system of works on which depends a very large amount of revenue, and it is, therefore, not correct to assume, that all the increase of revenue, which has accrued since these works were construct ed, is the direct result of the outlay on the Anikat alone ; this would be ignoring the numerous minor works which have been executed all over the delta"], [370, "336 at an immense outlay since the construction of the Anikat, and which have contributed in no small degree to the efficient maintenance of so large a system of irrigation. The proper course evi dently is to take each of the two great projects, the Upper Colleroon Anikat w _th the Cauvery dam and the Lower Anikat, with all the subsidiary works, constructed subsequent to them, which serve to distribute to the greatest advantage the supply secured by each great project, as one work, and all increase of revenue within the area under its influence, less the cost of maintenance and repair, as the in crease due to it. The maintenance and repair of recent subsidiary works cannot be easily distinguished from those on works which existed before the Anikats were built, and as a convenient arrangement, there fore, the aggregate of the prior may be deduct ed from the aggregate of subsequent outlay on repairs, and the difference taken as the cost of main tenance and repairs. This is the plan agreed to, so far as the expenditure side of the question is con cerned, between a former Collector and a former Superintending Engineer, Mr. Cadell and Colonel (then Captain) Oakes ; but it has not yet been worked out. 15. The question of the increase of revenue in each year subsequent to the construction of the Anikats, is much more complicated. For 13 years prior and 23 years subsequent to the construction of the Anikats, the Land revenue from irrigated cultivation, under the Olungu system, fluctuated very materially with the market selling price of paddy ;(6) so much so indeed, that an increase (6) Under the Olungu system, it was only the asssesment on lands classed as Nansei (i.e., those cultivated with paddy) that fluctuated with the market price. All lands cultivated with dry and garden crops were assessed at fixed money rates."], [371, "337 from improved irrigation was comparatively inappre ciable. In the very same year in which the Upper Anikat was completed, i.e. Fash 1246, it rose to Rs. 28,69,487 from Rs. 26,69,023 in the preceding year ; but what that increase of two lakhs of rupees in one year really signifies can be judged from the fact that, just two years back, i.e. Fasli 1243, it was Rs. 31,17,291, or nearly two lakhs and a half more than in Fasli 1246. In Fasli 1250, it fell off to Rs. 27,98,976, and in the following year, to Rs. 25,72,458. It then rose, and in 1255, came to Rs. 34,08 706. In 1258, it fell off again to Rs. 29,17,144, and in 1262, to which year a state ment made out in 1855 has been brought up, it stood at Rs. 33,73,148. 16. Another question for solution is whether it is the entire revenue on the area brought under cultivation since the construction of the Anikats, or only so much of it as may be considered to represent the value of water used, that should properly be put down to improved irrigation. In Tanjore, as in most other districts, the Nansei or wet assessment is a consolidated impost, and in all returns therefore of increase of revenue due to the Anikats, it has been usual to take into account the entire revenue on lands brought under wet cultivation since the construction of those works, whether they had been previously cultivated with dry crops or not. This is obviously incorrect, so far as lands previously under dry culti vation are concerned. As regards those brought under the plough for the first time since the con struction of the Anikats, it might perhaps be con sidered that they would not have been cultivated but for the irrigation ; but unless it can be shown that the peculiar position of the lands previously, such as being liable to be periodically submerged, precluded their being cultivated otherwise than with wet crops,"], [372, "338 it would be ignoring the apparent progress of agricul ture in non-deltaic countries. Doubtless a certain pro portion of the consolidated assessmentmay be assumed to represent the value of water, and the rest as the assessment of the land ; but the working out of the plan in detail is attended with peculiar difficulties. 17. The following table, prepared in the office of the Board of Revenue in 1855, <7< affords a clear view of the progress and fluctuations of the river irrigated cultivation and revenue for twenty-three years commencing from Fasli 1240,**8) the sixth year before the construction of the Upper Anikat.

Previous to this date, the practice was to substitute the full wet for dry assessment in such cases. The rates for dry crops irrigated refer almost entirely to lands irrigated by lift, there being very little cultivation of dry crops to which water flows by gravitation, and these rates being essentially below the ordinary wet rates, should not be taken into account in determining the general average of wet rates. The rates for irrigated wet cultivation include of course the deficiently watered lands in the extreme east of the delta. In the best irrigated and richly cultivated parts, they rise as high as Rs. 20 an acre. Taking the Combaconum taluk as fairly representing the ordinarily rich portion of the delta, the rate deduced from a total area of 85,256 acres paying a revenue, inclusive of second crop assessment, of Rs. 5,33,808, (of this Rs. 862 are water-tax on dry lands converted into wet) is Rs. 6-4-2 per acre. 19. The statistics above given all refer to the deltaic system of irrigation. A comparatively very small extent of land is cultivated under rain-fed tanks in the non-deltaic tracts comprising the taluk of Pattukkottei and portions of the taluks of Tanjore, 14"], [376, "342 Mannargudi, and Negapatam. The tanks generally are in anything but an efficient state of repair. The statistics of the area and revenue under tanks are available in sufficient detail only for Fasli 1279 (1869-70) and are shown below. They are restricted to Ryotwari (Government) area; those relating to Inams and Zamindaris which constitute by far the larger proportion^ of the area under tank irrigation in the district being unknown. The non-deltaic tracts are, from their entire dependence on local rains, peculiarly liable to be affected by the vicissitudes of season. Thus, in Fasli 1286 which was a year of severe drought, the revenue under tanks fell off to Rs. 64,164 from Rs. 1,20,596 in the preceding year; the amount of remissions granted having been as much as Rs. 52,947. In the succeeding year in which the rain-fall was more than usually abundant, the revenue rose to Rs. 1,34,996. As might be expected, this portion of the district presents a striking contrast to the delta. Taking the Pattukkottei taluk which is wholly non deltaic, its population and the proportion of the cultivated to the total area compare with the similar statistics of the four taluks entirely deltaic, viz., (9) Of 775 square miles, which comprise the total area of the Pattuk kottei taluk, only 172 make up Government villages, and the rest are Inam and Zamindari.

No land is appropriated to reservoirs of water for irrigation, all irrigation being direct from channels, and none is set apart for the pasture of cattle. 4. Bullocks constitute the ordinary agricultural stock of the district ; sometimes male buffaloes and more rarely female buffaloes and cows are employed for ploughing. In the delta, owing to the almost total absence of pasture lands, during the whole of the cultivation season, cattle are fed chiefly with straw ; during the interval between the harvest and the commencement of the following cultivation sea son, they graze upon stubble and such grass as is"], [381, "347 found on the banks of channels and paddy fields. The result, as might be expected, is, that the animals employed in ploughing are poorly fed, diminutive and necessarily deficient in the power of draft. Perhaps, the loose alluvial soil of the delta does not require deeper ploughing than is accomplished by means of these animals, more especially as the rice fields are lowered by the farm repair known as \" Kulivettu\" (digging pits) once in four or five years. In the non deltaic parts of the district, more especially where, as in the table land south-west of Tanjore, the soi1 consists of agglomerated laterite, the poor yield of the crops now obtained is due very probably in a great measure to indifferent tilling. The district draws its supplies of cattle for agriculture, as well as for carriage and domestic uses, chiefly from Salem and Mysore.

Cost of both Manure 5. The ploughshare is of a primitive kind consist ing only of a piece of wood with a pointed end, to which a pair of bullocks is yoked by means of a simple wooden pole and a yoke. A pair of bullocks would cost on an average 35 Rupees, and the imple ments of husbandry (excepting the plough for which no charge is incurred) i. e., a manvetti (momaty) or native hoe and other sundry tools, for working one plough, about two rupees*2). Ordinarily, one plough, with a pair of bullocks and one set of imple ments, would suffice to cultivate about 6 acres of irri gated, and 8 of unirrigated, land. A pair of bullocks would last on an average five years. 6. The Tanjore farmers fully recognise the necessity for manuring ; but it is hardly possible that the required quantity of manure can be found for the whole of the Cauvery delta. There are not sufficient cattle, sheep or goats for it, and owing to the absence of pasture, a sufficiency of these can not be maintained. As a rule, in the case of irrigat ed nansei or rice cultivation, it is only the fields on which two crops are raised that are manured every year, and even these not invariably, for it is not always that the required manure is available. Single crop lands are generally manured once in five years ; in some cases not at all, the latter being often the case where the holdings are very large and also where, owing to the Mirasidar not residing on the spot or other causes, the cultivation is neglected. In the more western and better irrigated parts of the delta, the alluvia brought down by the river freshes and the stubble which is ploughed into the soil, are generally believed to furnish the required manure. (2) For the plough the wood is easily procured from the Mirasidar's own trees or those on village Purampdk land, and the village carpenter is bound to make the plough gratis."], [383, "349 and ordinarily manure is considered essential only where the soil is poor or the rice lands depend for their irrigation on the drainage of those situated higher up, which brings them little or no alluvial matter. In the case of dry cultivation, as also of irrigated cultivation under tanks and wells in the upland parts of the district, manure is more generally employed, great pains being taken to procure it. 7. The mode of manuring generally adopted is by enfolding sheep and goats(3) or cattle ; the former being more commonly employed. Cattle manure preserved in houses and in cart and cattle stands, vegetable mould,(4) ashes and other refuse of cook rooms, night soil and silt scraped from the beds of dried up tanks are also used ; but all these excepting perhaps vegetable mould, can be found in sufficient quantities for only small hold ings. The charge for a flock of 100 goats enfolded one night is two marakkals of paddy, worth about 2 annas and 8 pies, and seven such flocks are required for manuring one acre of nansei land ; the cost of manuring one acre, therefore, is Rs. 1-2-8, and taking that the manuring is done at this rate once in five years, the average per year per acre comes to 3 annas and 8 pies. The charge for a herd of 50 cattle for one night is 4 marak kals of paddy, worth about 5 annas and 4 pies, and four such herds are required for manuring one acre ; the cost of manuring in this case is thus Rs. 1-5-4 and the annual rate Rs. 0-4-3. Where babul fruits, a favourite food of goats, are available in sufficient quantities, the herdsmen un- (3) The flocks of goats employed for this purpose come chiefly from the Marava country on the south and the villages of the Trichinopoly district north of the Colleroon. They are brought by herdsmen who remain in the district for about three months of the dry season and then return with then* flocks to their respective countries.

Where manure is otherwise procured, it costs 2 annas a cart-load, in addition to cart hire, which is gene- rally one anna a mile, and taking that it has to be carried, on an average, a distance of 4 miles, the cost of one cart-load of manure would come to 6 annas. Ordinarily, 5 cart-loads will be required for one acre of land, and the cost of manuring one acre, therefore, comes to Rs. 1-14-0, and the annual rate to 6 annas. These rates can be regarded to be only approximate ; they apply to nansei or irrigated lands, but may be considered to apply more or less also to dry and garden lands in the delta. The backyards of cultivating tenants, in which generally garden crops are grown, of course receive more manure. In the upland parts of the district generally, more manure is used both for dry and irrigated cultiva tion. 8. For one Veli of ordinarily good land in the delta, the quantity of seed put down is 10 kalams, and the out-turn on an average 200 kalams or twenty-fold. The proportion necessarily varies with the quality of the soil and advantages of irrigation. Thus, in the case of the best irrigated and most pro- ductive lands in the more western parts of the delta, 8 kalams of seed bring in 350 kalams or about 44 fold. In the case of the poorly irrigated lands situ- ated at the tail ends of the Cauvery channels in the eastern extremity of the delta, 15 kalams have to be sown for an out-turn of 120 kalams, .. e. eight- fold, which even is not always counted upon as certain. The rate of seed per Veli varies also in the case of the different kinds of paddy. In the case of dry crops, the quantity of seed for a given area is not fixed and the fold of the crop to seed varies very considerably with the kinds and"], [385, "351 Rotation us crops Fallow, Varieties of Paddy. depends also on the nature of the soil as well as sea son ; it is on the whole much greater than in the case of paddy. In a recent report from the Col lector, the average quantity of seed and the average yield in lb. per acre are given thus : \u2014 9. In the case of irrigated cultivation, there is no rotation of crops except that the land usually de voted to paddy is sometimes planted with betel vines or sugar-cane. Such instances, however, are rare. Where a dry grain or pulse is sown as a second crop on wet or irrigated land, it is sometimes changed between ragi, the pulse called vayalpayaru and gin gelly ; but this only by choice and not as a necessity. In purely dry cultivation, however, varagu is con sidered to impair the fertility of the soil, and the land is, therefore, either left fallow or laid under an alternate crop, generally cumboo or dholl, every second year. In the case of other dry and garden crops, the species is often changed; but here likewise it is only choice that suggests the change. The land is left fallow, where necessary, sometimes every second year and sometimes once in three or four years. 10. Of paddy grown in the delta there are two major species, Kar and Pasanam ; the former is the early and the latter the later crop. The Kar season (5) Dated 1st September 1878, No. 3,500. Irrigated.

The Kar is divided into two minor species, Kadappu and Kar proper, and the Pasanam is similarly divided into Semba and Pasanam proper ; each minor species consists of several varieties. 11. The instalments for the collection of Govern- ment demand are adjusted to the seasons of the two major species ; for the Kar, it is collected by three unequal monthly instalments beginning from Novem ber, in which month it is harvested, and for the Pasanam, it is collected by five monthly instalments, also unequal, commencing from February that being the month in which this crop is harvested.

The dates of the actual commencement and termination of cultivation operations vary in the different parts of the district. This is due to the first supply of freshes reaching the eastern portion of the delta later ; not that a flood takes any number of days in travelling within the district, but because the early flood is almost wholly utilized westward and the cultivators at the eastern end have to wait until the more copious and therefore uninter rupted series of freshes reach them. Thus, in the furthest west of the delta, the Kar cultivation (planting) begins in May and the crop is harvested in September ; the Pasanam cultivation begins in September and the crop is harvested in January when (oftener a few days before) a third crop, a pulse called \" Vayal-payaru\"(6) is sown and picked in two months, i. e. in March. This pulse requires no ploughing and grows chiefly with the aid of the moisture that remains in the field and succeeds even if there be no rain afterwards. In the extreme east of the delta, on the other hand, where more than one crop is hardly ever cultivated, the cultivation begins in August and sometimes (as when freshes are later than usual) in September, and the crop is harvested in March. Where only one crop is grown in the year, it is more generally one of seven months duration from planting to reaping The general mean may be taken broadly as four months from July to October for the Kar species, and as six months from September to February for the Pasanam. 14. Wherever two crops are raised, the second is usually one of the quicker growing varieties of (6) Means field pulse ; the prefix being intended to distinguish it from the dry grains and pulses which are grown more generally on high level lands. Dry cultivation in Tanjore is divided under two heads, \" Vayal punsei\" and \" Tidal punsei,\" signifying respectively field punsei and high ground punsei. (See Report of the Tanjore Committee, dated 22nd Febru ary 1807, para 61.)"], [389, "355 A dry grain or pulse raised as aa auxiliary crop. Semba. Taking the delta as a whole, the proportion of Kadappu Kar species to the entire paddy crop may be taken(7-> to be one-sixth. 15. The Kar species draws more water and yields a greater abundance of crop than the Pasanam. It will bear almost any amount of moisture without being injured. In times of old, when the rainfall in October and November used to be very heavy, with, at the same time, high floods in the rivers, it was usual to reap the Kar crop in the very midst of rain and with water standing in the fields two feet deep. 16. Throughout the delta, the invariable mode of irrigated cultivation is transplanting. Kuttalei is the only variety of paddy sown broad-cast; but it is grown chiefly in the upland -parts of the district. In some villages in the central part of the delta, one of the varieties of Pasanam, called Ottadan, is planted along with Kadappu proper ; when the latter which grows quicker is reaped, the ends of the Ottadan plants, then about half grown, are cut along with it, and the latter then shoot up the more luxuriantly for it and come to maturity at the usual season of the Pasanam harvest. In this case, the seeds of the two varieties are mixed together (in the proportion of three fourths Kadappu and one-fourth Ottadan) before they are put down in the nursery, and the young plants of both, which are hardly distinguishable, are planted promiscuously. 17. Allusion has been made to the pulse (Vayal payaru) grown as a third crop on paddy lands. More generally, however, a dry crop forms an auxi liary to only a single crop of paddy, being adopted (7) There is no reliable record to show the relative extents of the cultivation of the two species."], [390, "356 Dry and garden crops. as an alternative where, as often happens, the avail able supply of water is not sufficient for two paddy crops, or the Mirasidars cannot afford the requisite labor. The dry crop is either the pulse above-men tioned, gingelly or ragi ; the latter two require ploughing, but it is only ragi that is planted. This additional crop is raised either before or after the paddy season. In the first case, it is sown or plant ed, as the case may be, with the aid of the summer shower or the first fresh when it happens to come earlier than usual but cannot be relied upon for beginning operations for the cultivation of a regular wet crop. In the second case, if the dry crop is gingelly or ragi, the field is ploughed when there is yet moisture in it ; the crop is then sown or plant ed in February and reaped in May, being matured entirely by the summer showers. 18. The principal dry and garden crops, with the area laid under each in the Revenue year 1875-76, are shown in the table appended to para. 1. Those numbered 4 to 16 are classed as Punsie and those numbered 17 to 24 as tottakka 1, i.e. green and garden crops.

Punsei 275,229 21*8 Tottakkal 43,019 3'4 The second head, however, does not include back yards of houses, which are very generally cultivated with garden crops as well as occupied by fruit trees. These are wholly exempt from assessment. The extent of land occupied by them is not ascertain able ; but -i rough estimate may be made of it. The"], [391, "357 total number of houses in the district according to the last Census, is 369,984 or very nearly 370,000, and allowing on an average one-tenth of an acre(8) for each house, the aggregate of the area thus occu pied comes to 37,000 acres or 2-9 per cent, on the total extent of cultivation, and this much, therefore, may be fairly added to the extent of garden cultiva tion, making it 6-3 per cent, on the whole. 19. As regards the seasons of dry and garden crops it may be generally stated, that the crops are divided into two series, viz., those of the first six months and those of the second six months, corres ponding in the main with the Kar and Pasanam seasons of the paddy crop, each being taken roughly to comprise a period of six months. It is not that the kinds are invariably restricted to the particular season ; several of both dry and garden crops are cultivated in either of the two and sometimes in both the seasons ; the division has reference to the periods of harvest, of which there are two in the year and to which the Khistbandi or instalments for the collection of the Government demand are adjusted. The early season, as in the case of nansei, closes in October \u2014 November, and the later in February \u2014 March. The dry crops of the early season are chiefly cumboo, ragi and chdlum ; those of the later season varagu, dholl, gram, ulundu, gingelly and others. Of garden crops, a few are cultivated in both seasons, (8) The existing usage of the district allows to agricultural classes 40 kulis of 12 feet square for each house, exclusive of the site of the building, and to non-agricultural classes the same quantity of land inclusive of it. Agricultural classes constitute by far the largest proportion of the popula tion of the district, and further, a large number of houses have backyards free at the old higher scale, which in some cases allowed as much as 120 kulis, in addition to the site of the house. On the other hand, the extent of land actually granted for backyards is limited to available space ; the rates specified being the maxima not to be exceeded ; and there are many instances, in which newly formed house sites and backyards have, from various causes, not been exempted from the payment of assessment. On the whole, therefore, 30 kulis, equal to about one-tenth of an acre, may be taken as a fair average. id"], [392, "358 but rarely on the same land ; the majority are cultivated but once in the year, the crop being picked about the close of the later season, generally in January and February. Some special products such as plantain, betel leaf and the dye root (morinda citrifolia) extend over longer periods than one year. 20. On dry and garden crops, the assessment is collected with the Kar or Pasanam khists according as the land is cultivated before or after October. The distribution of the demand over the several months of the season is the same, as in the case of Nansei. Sometimes but rarely, two dry crops are taken off the same land, but as no charge is made in such cases, there is no collection in the later season, except where Government water is used, in which case the charge for it is apportioned over the months of the Pasanam khist. 21. The following table shows the dry and gar den crops cultivated in the district, with the dates on which each is sown or planted ; reaped or gathered.

The plantations of this fruit tree extend for miles along the banks of the Cauvery proper, the Kudamurutti, the Arasileiyaru, and the Vira- colan. The tree yields fruit generally for three, sometimes four or five years. Its leaves are even in greater demand than the fruit, owing to their being used as plates to eat from, and in bazaar stations, leaves of ordinarily large size sell as high as half a dozen an anna. The unripe fruit of the Mondan variety, (see further on), is very generally used in curries by Brahmans, and the pith of the plant is a favourite article of curry with them. The bark is used for cordage, as also for packing flowers, vegetables, and more especially, tobacco in small packets. It is also often used in the same manner as the leaves.

The area devoted to this and the other dye-root, Imbura (Hedyotis umbellata) in 1875-76 is reported to be 2,696 acres ; but it is evidently understated, as the produce of the district, after supplying the demand for home manufacture, leaves a surplus for export to Madura. The only part of the district, where the plant is grown to any considerable extent, is the sandy tract at the south-eastern end of the district, near Point Calimere, where it is a remunera- tive crop and a principal article of trade. The tobacco consists of broad thick leaves, and is prized for its strength and pungency. It is used, however, only for chewing, and is chiefly exported to the Straits Settlement. Tobacco is cultivated in small patches, also in the delta, chiefly on Padugheis or river margins and in backyards of tenants' houses. The total area devoted to this crop, exclusive of backyards of houses, averages about a thousand acres, of which about four hundred belong to the part of the district first mentioned.

These rates have all been now superseded by village averages, based chiefly on the Amani outturn of the earlier years. The higher averages for garden crops are charged only where Government water is used, and lands cultivated with garden crops under private wells are classed as punsei and charged at the lower or dry crop averages, thus giving the cultivators the benefit of their own improvements.

Now, the tree tax is still less, being only Rs. 52,863, tis per the Jamabandi accounts of Fasli 1286 (1876-77) ; and as there can be no doubt that the damage by the hurricane of 1853 has been more than repaired by fresh plantations within the last twenty-five years, and that the district is now more largely wooded than it was before that date ; the present small amount of the revenue must be considered to be the result of the recent exemption from tax of trees on Patta lands, i. . ., lands on which land assessment is levied. Probably also, there has been concealment of trees which should be taxed. At a later date, (Board's Proceedings, 22nd January 1858,) the number of taxed trees were reckoned at 678,975 or 63,736 more than in 1854-55.

Except in the case of tops planted under the Top Rules, (Board's Standing Order, No. 121);(n) trees in tops, as also those scattered on waste or Poramp6k lands, are taxed, when they come to bearing, at so much for each tree. None other but fruit trees are taxed. In all cases, the trees are the property of the Mirasidar or ryot who is at liberty to fell or otherwise dispose of them at pleas lire. The tax is remitted, however, only when the trees have withered or are past bearing. When the aggregate amount of tax is reduced by such remission to less than the land assessment at the dry rate (which however occurs very rarely), the latter is substituted for it. The description of trees liable to tax, with the scale of tax now generally obtaining in Govern- ment villages in the district, is shown in the subjoined table. This scale was fixed by the first Collector, Mr. Charles Harris, at the beginning of this century. Previous to the Paimash or native survey which took place in 1826 \u2014 1829, various other rates were intro- duced by different Collectors in different parts of the district ; but since then, Mr. Harris' scale became generally apphcable except in the case of trees pre viously otherwise taxed, and as there must be few (11) Private tops planted under these rules are exempt from all tax for twenty years from the date of planting, after which only the assess ment on the land is levied.

The irrigated cultivation in the delta depends, as has been seen, chiefly on the freshes of the Cauvery. The first fresh comes down generally in the latter part of May, but is not depended upon for commenc ing cultivation operations, as it often subsides and is not followed by the regular, continuous freshes for several days ; so that it serves only to refresh cattle by filling the shallow village ponds and is utilized to a small extent for hot weather garden crops. The regular freshes commence about the middle of June and continue more or less uninter ruptedly till about the middle of November, when they begin to subside. At this time the staple crop (the Pasanam species) of paddy is in the stage when the ears begin to form, and for about forty days from this period, it is dependent for nourishment chiefly on the North-East Monsoon. It requires, however, at this stage only a succession of light showers at short intervals, and it is only the total absence of Mr. Harris' scale. Bate per tree Equivalent in Fanam. RS. A. P. 1.

Another anxious period of the paddy season is the interval between the two mon soons. The ideal of a good season presumes the entire absence of this interval, and when it does occur, the degree of loss is proportioned to the length of its duration. It is ordinarily the Tamil month of Purat tasi (September \u2014 October), and \" Purattasi kac cel\" (the second word signifying drought) is a common term indicating evil in Tanjore. The freshes are usually low in September and October; but it is the failure of rain at the same time that con stitutes the crisis. It is, however, its unusual character, and not its frequency, that originally gave a special name to the drought. 27. Here again, the description of the season re fers to the delta taken as a whole ; but it cannot be held to be true as regards alike the extreme west and the extreme east of it. The extreme west, which has the advantage of being supplied first, is not known to have ever suffered from the defi ciency of river-supply. On the other hand, the extreme east is often exposed to the alternations of drought and inundation, drought from the river supply, when it is low, being all utilized higher up, and inundation from the floods, when they are too high and not wanted, being all let down. In either case, the evil is aggravated by the presence or absence of rain. It is to be observed, however, that it is the later or Pasanam crop that suffers from either drought or inundation. The earlier, or kar crop is completely protected from either ; from drought by reason of the freshes in the rivers being abundant during its growth, and from inundation"], [412, "378 Process of cultivation. by its capacity to bear almost any amount of moisture Paddy 28. The crops and seasons having been thus briefly described, the process of cultivation as re- gards the paddy crop will be now stated. In the month of June, as soon as the regular freshes have commenced, the seed (steeped in water for a day or two) is sown in the nurseries on some auspicious day, the nurseries being previously ploughed and watered twice or thrice. The day after sowing, the nurseries are drained ; the third day they are again watered and drained the following day. After this, they are watered every ten days until the seedlings grow to a size fit for transplantation. In the meantime, the fields are got ready for planting ; they are watered about the same day as the seed beds ; are ploughed once or twice, and kept soaking for a few days. When the planting takes place, they must be ploughed once more. The planting commences as soon as the plants have grown up to the required size except when the fields happen to be submerged by heavy rain or high floods, or the requisite supply of water fails, or the requisite labor is want- ing. In all such cases it is delayed a few days, generally not exceeding a week ; this being the time the plants may be left growing in seed-beds or kept in bundles after they have been plucked out, without deteriorating in quality. The planting is entrusted to women, more particularly of the Pallar caste, who are considered to be especially skilled in the opera- tion. That of weeding is carried on thrice during the growth of the plants. 29. When the fields are planted, there is hardly any water beyond what is contained in the puddle into which its surface is turned. They are not irrigated for three days after planting, and any water that"], [413, "379 Modes of dry and garden cultivation. Farm labourer! Pannei cultiva' tion comes into them otherwise is drained off ; after this they are irrigated and drained alternately as often as may be required until the ears are formed. The depth of water required to be maintained is, for about a month and a half after the first irrigation begins, generally four native fingers equal to about two English inches and a half ; afterwards it is gradually increased, according to circumstances, to between one and two native spans, (one span being equal to about eight English inches) ; these being the minimum and maximum between which the depth of water in the field may vary without the crop suffer ing from deficiency or excess. The alternate process of irrigation and drainage is kept up all the time, and the fields are run dry after the ears have ripened. 30. After the grain has ripened, it is allowed to dry for two to three weeks before it is reaped ; but in the case of large estates, the reaping is delayed a few days longer from the amount of labor required not being at once forthcoming. 31. The modes of dry and garden cultivation are much the same as elsewhere ; peculiar features where such exist have been noticed in the table appended to para. 21. 32. In Tanjore, where the Ryot Pattadar is not himself the laborer (he is generally so in the upland parts of tbe district) , cultivation is carried on by either of two modes, viz., by Panneiyals or hired labor, and by Purakkudis or tenants. 33. In the case of pannei cultivation, the laborers employed are either Parayas or Pallars, or Cudras"], [414, "380 of the ordinary Palli or Vannia class/12) Such hired laborers are employed also by Purakkudis, when, as on occasions of planting, weeding and reaping, a larger number of hands are required. Ploughing and other ordinary operations are per formed by Purakkudis themselves and their families. The status of all Panneiyals in former clays was slavery. From the report of the Tanjore Commis sioners (1799), it appears, that the landholders bought and sold them to each other as they did their cattle ; the price then current having been 20 chakrams, equal to a little over Rs. 31, each ; but no vestige of slavery now remains. On the other (12) The'general impression seems to be, that the Paraya classes consti- tute the bulk of agricultural laborers in this country. This evidently, so far as Tanjore is concerned, is a mistake. According to the last cen- sus, the total Paraya population of the district is 306,509, of which the proportion of adult males is only 96,098 (that of adult females is not shown). The agricultural male adult population of the district, as per the census, is 256,366 ; but this is restricted to persons engaged in agriculture on their own account. Taking, as the Board of Eevenue have done in their pro- ceedings, dated 9th March 1378, No. 620, all male laborers above 12 years of age, by reason of the bulk of them being agricultural, but excluding Mirasidars and Zemindars, who do not cultivate themselves, but whom the Board have included likewise in their figures, the number comes to 352,819. There can be no doubt, however, that the proportion of the laborers of the Paraya classes was formerly much greater. It became diminished very materially by the devastations of Hyder in the year 1781. The Tanjore Commissioners, in their report above alluded to, say : \u2014 \" Many are known to have starved, others to have been driven away to the enemy's country, and not a few to have engaged with the Europeans as sepoys, horse-keepers, &c. ; so completely however are they dispersed, that some Mirasidars declare they do not now possess more than one slave or Pallar in villages where they formerly maintained thirty or forty.\" It does not appear, that this denudation of agricultural labor had the effect of impairing the resources of the district ; on the contrary it appears, that the immigrations by which it wasr replenished, tended to increase the produce. The Commissioners add, \" Such a sweep of all the laborers of the country was a check to cultivation, that hardly accords with its present fertility, and yet our enquiries into the mystery have been most satisfactorily answered, and the country appears to be materially benefited by the change. The necessity felt by the Mirasidars for hands to cultivate called forth in larger numbers than ordinary all the inferior classes of Malabars and Gen- tus who under the name of Payakaras undertake the cultivation of the village, and being paid in proportion to the fertility, and of course being interested iu the produce, of the soil, the labor they perform is considered fully equal to that of double the same number of slaves. In this way, emigrants from other countries are accommodated with a livelihood as Payakaras, and thus it is that the landholders of a village are able some times to cultivate in full and at others only a part of the Sarkar lands ; but this is more prevalent in those villages where the Brahmans are the Mira sidars whose prejudices prevent them from partaking but in a small degree in the labors of the field and render them dependent on their slaves or ex ternal aid.\""], [415, "381 hand, the general complaint now is, that the Panneiyals desert the Mirasidars, without working out their advances, and that the advances are often lost from want of assets. 34. In the case of Purakkudi cultivation, the _J\u2122akkndi tenant provides the required seed and ploughing stock and, in consideration of it and the labor spent on cultivation, receives a certain share ofthe out-turn whatever it may be ; the share varying in different parts, from 18 to 33 per cent. The difference is due chiefly to variation in the productive powers of the land ; the rate being high or low according as the same amount of labor brings in a more or less abundant out-turn ; it is due in some cases also to the abundance or deficiency of available labor. In some villages, the rate of Kudivaram is calculated upon the out-turn less a certain percentage for village charges, and in such cases, 3-|- per cent, is allowed to the Purakkudi in addition to his varam as Kalavadi or the privilege of gleaning the grain spilt on the threshing floor. It does seem an anomaly, that the Purakkudi should be satisfied in the one case with a small proportion of what he would get in the other ; but probably the difference in the prevailing rates of Purakkudivaram covers the inequality arising in this onlti- respect. In the Purakkudi system of cultivation, the tenant's varam does not include Kudimaramat, (ihe customary farm repairs usually termed \" village labor\"), or manuring, or the remuneration of village servants, all of which are separately provided for by the Mirasidar or Ryot-proprietor. Kudimaramat and the remuneration of village servants will be more fully noticed in their proper places. 35. An attempt will be made now to calculate Cost of irrigated the cost of irrigated paddy cultivation per acre under 49"], [416, "382 both the Pannei and Purakkudi systems. To elu cidate the following tables, it is necessary to state that the quantity of land which can be cultivated by means of one plough with a pair of bullocks and one farm laborer, is assumed to be six-sevenths of a Tanjore Veli,(13) equal to 5*67 acres, and the percent age charges where they depend on produce are calculated upon the assumption, that the gross produce of this quantity of land is 124-51 Tanjore kalams^14) or 21-96 kalams an acre. In order that the component items of the cost of Pannei cultivation may be understood, it must also be stated, that besides the daily rate of grain wage, the Pan neiyal or predial laborer is entitled to glean the grain spilt on the threshing floor, and also receives aid in the shape of small presents in grain, money, &c, on occasions of wedding, childbirth, death and the Pongal festival. The Panneiyal and Purakkudi are further both allowed sites for their houses and back yards free of rent, and the former receives besides an advance of money without interest to build his house.

The data for determining this are the estimated gross produce of the land, the cost of cultivation, and the Government assessment. The cost of cultivation has been shown above, and the gross produce may be deduced from the assessment which the ryot pays to Government, as the latter represents the value of a defined share of the produce at a certain commutation rate. The assessment, of course,"], [419, "385 varies very considerably, according to the nature of the soil and the advantages of irrigation, but the general average for irrigated paddy land may be taken as Rs. 5 per acre. This, less a small cess averaging 6\" 5 pies per acre for the remuneration of the Nattukarnams (see Chap. IV, p. 21) represents the value, at the fixed commutation rate, of the nominal Government share in the gross produce, which may be arrived at, therefore, thus : \u2014 Assessment, less the Nattukarnam's cess, Rs. 5-0-0\u2014 Rs. 0-0-6-5 = 4-15-5-5 Divide this by the commutation rate, i. e Rs. 0-7-8f The quotient is the Government share of the gross produce, i. e 10-32 Kalams.

In round numbers, the proportion of the Govern ment share to gross produce may be taken to be 10 to 22. Now, the cost of cultivation, as given in table A in para. 35 above, so far as it is made up of grain disbursements, comes to 5 Kalams 2'5 Marakkals per acre,(16) and adding to this 1 Kalam 10 Marakkals as the proportion of money disbursements reduced to an equivalent in grain, the total cost comes to a trifle over 7 Kalams/17 (16.) 29 Kalams, 635 Marakkals divided by 567, being the number of acres which can be cultivated with one plough.

The cost of cultivation, whatever it was ac tually at the time the present assessment was fixed, remains unaffected by the subsequent fluctuations of the food market, inasmuch as it consists almost en tirely of disbursements in grain ; but the relative proportions of the Government assessment and the ryots' net profit to the gross produce have become very materially altered by the increased price of food grains. It is to be observed, that the commutation rate by which the present money assessment was determined about fifty years ago, represents the average village sales of a series of years, and the range of similar sales is now generally assumed to be a Rupee a kalam or a little more than double the commutation rate (As 7 pies 8f ) ; the last two years of scarcity (1876-77 and 1877-78) being left out of account.

The foregoing calculations refer to irrigated paddy cultivation, which contributes in by far the largest ratio alike to the public revenue and private wealth. In the case of dry and garden crops, the cost of cultivation necessarily varies with each crop, and there being no uniform standard of produce and price, it is impossible to work out the ryot's net profit. In consideration, however, of the proportion of the out-turn to the labor employed being smaller in the case of these crops ; the Government's nominal share of the produce was originally fixed lower by 10 per cent, for dry and 20 per cent, for garden than for nansei crop ; and as the prices of all agricultural produce have risen in about the same ratio, the aver age rent profit of the ryot proprietor at present must bear the same proportion to Government assessment as in the case of paddy cultivation. In a return sub mitted in 1863, the general average rates for dry and garden cultivation for the whole district are given as Rs. l-3-9T*>e and Rs. 3-7-10-f-f per acre respectively;"], [422, "388 Wages of agricul tural labor. latterly the head ' garden' has been dispensed with ; irrigated garden being merged in wet and unirrigated garden in dry, and the rate for the head ' dry' thus made up, as given in the Board's review of the land revenue reports for Fasli 1285, is Rs. 1-3-11 per acre. The average is struck upon the total area held in holdings less waste remitted at the annual settlement, and varies slightly from year to year by reason of the variation in the rates of assessment on such waste, as well as on lands taken up and given up. The dry and garden rates, reported in 1863, have also since then slightly increased by the accession of certain resumed village fees. On the whole, how ever, these variations being very slight; for all practical purposes, the rate of dry assessment may be taken to be Rs. 1-4-0 per acre, and the ryots' net profit to be a little more than doubled. 39. The ordinary rate of wage to an able-bodied predial laborer is, as already stated, three-fourths of a Marakkal of paddy a day. It is equal to about 3-981b., which would give about 2'551b. of clean rice. The rate is generally the same for an adult female of the Paraya or Palla caste, as women of these castes are considered to be particularly skilled in planting paddy, and in most parts of the delta, are alone employed on this work. For boys, the rate is a half of the above, women of other castes than those above mentioned are rarely employed on agricultural labor. The rate above specified applies only to laborers who are permanently attached or are expected to be attached to the service of their employers, and it is in these cases alone they receive aid on occasions of wedding, child-birth, &c. and advances to build their houses, and are provided with sites for their houses free of rent. For laborers not thus engaged but employed casually, the ordinary rate"], [423, "389 is a marakkal or 5-31b. of paddy which would give 3*41b. of clean rice a day for an able-bodied adult male, decreasing to half as much in the case of those of inferior strength ; but when there is a pressing demand for labor as at the season of harvest, or when some large work is being carried out in the neighbourhood, the rate is increased and sometimes doubled. 40. As wages of agricultural labor are paid almost invariably ;n kind, the condition of the laborer is not affected by the fluctuations of the food market.- And so long as the cultivation of the Cauvery delta is kept up, there can be no lack of employment for him, and with, further, an ever inviting market in Ceylon, his condition is all that can be desired. 41. Now the agricultural statistics will be analy's- ed with the view to determine, so far as they permit, the atioia o\u00a3 food srains- production, consumption and exportation of food grains. For statistics of production, the average of five years from Fash 1281 to 1285, and for those of trade, the average of the corresponding financial years, 1871-72 to 1875-76, as they are respectively recorded, will be taken. The year 1876-77 is excluded, because it was an exceptionably unfavor able year, and the prevalence of scarcity in other parts of the Presidency gave rise to large exports of which the exact amount cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.

This is obviously much too low ; as deducting 7 kalams for cost of cultivation (see p. 36 ante), it leaves only 73 kalams which, with prices corresponding to the commutation rate (Rs. 0 -7-8f), would fetch only about Rs. 3-8-2; thus rendering it impossible for the ryot even to discharge the Government demand which is Rs. 5."], [425, "391 15,568 acres under Cholum at 840 lb. per acre ... ... 13,077,120 1b.

This calculation, however, rests on general standards of produce, which must be taken to repre sent the outturn of an average season. But in the five years which have been taken for the purpose of the calculation, the outturn of crops has been report ed to have been as follows : \u2014 Fasli 1281.\u2014 Wet crop under three-fourths and dry under two-thirds of an average yield. \u201e 1282. \u2014 -The outturn of wet crops ranged between two-thirds and three- fourths ; that of dry crops averag- ed about one-half of the average. \u201e 1283. \u2014 Outturn considerably below the aver- age.

It must be however very small, and the rate of consumption allowed (which is the same in both cases) would cover it, as owing to dry grains being stronger fooch. they are not consumed at tlie same rate as rice. (22.) In this calculation, the areas have been taken from the annual returns of acreage under different crops, the accuracy of which is especial ly open to doubt in so far as they relate to Zamindaris ; but as the entire area of Zamindaris in this district is under 8 per cent, and lies beyond the delta, its contribution to the food supplies of the district must be insigni ficant, aud any error in respect of it cannot materially vitiate the aggre gate of the estimate."], [426, "392 Consumption Fasli 1284. \u2014 Rather over the average. \u201e 1285. \u2014 Below the average. Indeed, with generally diminished rain-fall and the frequent occurrence of unfavourable seasons, it does not seem correct to assume what was regarded in former days as normal average to be so now, and it seems proper to strike out at least 10 per cent, out of the estimated produce as above specified. The remainder then would be 926,722,472 lbs. or 413,715-3 tons. 43. The rate of consumption has now to be con sidered. In'the discussions relating to famine wage, one lb. and a half of clean rice a day seems to have been considered essential for an able-bodied adult laborer. But in adopting a general rate for the ag gregate of the population, a deduction must be made for invalids, as well as the non-laboring classes who do not consume at the ordinary rate. A deduction must be made also for flesh meat and fish, which enter in varying degrees into the food of the dif ferent classes of the population, and it must further be noted that indulgence in intoxicating liquors, at least when it exceeds a certain limit, reduces the usual rate of consumption of ordinary food. On the whole, therefore, a pound and a quarter of food grains seems to be a liberal rate for an adult, taking males and females together ; more especially as the adult age according to the census classification begins from thirteen. Adopting this rate as the basis of the calculation, it seems fair to allow a half of it for children above six and not exceeding twelve years of age, and a quarter for those of six years and under. Applying these rates to the population of the district"], [427, "393 Exportation, as per the last census, the amount of consumption per day is arrived at as follows : \u2014 Adults ... 1,266,776 at 1| lb. 1,583,470 Children above six and not ex- ceeding twelve 294,404 at \\ \u201e 184,002 do. under six 412,551 at \u201e 128,922 1,973,731 1,896,394 And this multipli- ed by 365 gives as the total esti- mated annual consumption ... 692,183,810 lb. or 309,010'6 tons.

Taking first exports from British Ports, it will be seen that rice and paddy together (column 3) amount to 81,046-2 tons. Deducting for husk one- third from the quantity of paddy, its equivalent in clean rice may be taken to be 1,462-5 tons, and this added to the quantity of rice, makes a total of 80,314-9 tons. Now the amount, of exports from Kareikkal may be safely assumed to be all rice and paddy, since dry grains grown in the District are not sufficient for even home consumption, and of imports from other Districts the proportion exported by Sea must be necessarily, very small. Taking then the proportion of paddy included therein to be the same as in the case of exports from British Ports, and allowing for husk in the ratio above named, the equivalent in clean rice would come to 20,544 tons. Exports of grains by rail inland being very small (these take place only when scarcity prevails in the adjoining Districts) may be left out of account. 46. The total exports therefore amount to : \u2014 80,314-9 + 20,544 = 100,858-9. The imports of rice and paddy together (the latter being reduced to clean rice by the method above indicated) come to 2,046-8 tons, and deducting this quantity, the net amount of exports in rice is 98,812-1 tons. 47.

No reply was sent from Tan jore to the queries circulated in the year 1814 (let ter from Government to the Board of Revenue, dated 2nd August 1814)<1) which elicited the 'very able and interesting paper of Mr. F. W. Ellis on the Mirasi right as he found it in Tondamandalam/2) and this is the more strange, as by the concurrent testimony of traditions, as well as Mr. Ellis' paper, Tanjore was the birth-place of this tenure. 2. The enquiries instituted by the Officers of the British Government on their assumption of the ad ministration of the district at the end of the last century were directed solely to the fiscal resources of the country and the modes of collecting the pub lic revenue, and even on these subjects no informa tion anterior to the year 1773 was forthcoming.'3) The utmost, therefore, that was elicited referred to what system of Revenue administration the Mahratta rulers had brought with them from the Dakhan in the latter part of the seventeenth century, and that system had been borrowed by them from the Pathan (1).

Of the ancient and genuine Hindu Government ; of the taxes which the Hindu rulers imposed and the mode in which they realized them, no information was available and none was recorded. 3. But however it may have originated, there seems to be little doubt, that a tenure of proprietary tenancy, with all the incidents of valuable property, existed in Tanjore from times of unknown antiquity. It is hardly possible that a country could have for ages been in such a high state of agricultural pros perity and could have possessed village institutions in such a state of perfection witho; a fixity of tenure and a recognized property in land. 4. General William Blackburne, the Resident at the Court of the Raja of Tanjore, in a memorandum which he submitted to Lord William Bentinck on the 27th December 1804, on the Mirasi right as it existed at that date, says : \u2014 (4) \" It possesses all the essential qualities of property. It has been respect ed as sacred by every successive Government in Tanjore. In its origin, it was probably derived from the grant of the sovereign, but its origin is anterior to all the written documents in Tanjore, and I have sought in vain for some traditions or other information that might enable me to ascertain it. The antiquity of Coonabao, or Mirasi as it is now call, d, is undisputed, and there is no tradition of any change, having been made in the nature of the tenure. The Mirasidar sells, mortgages or transfers the whole or any part of his land to another person, without any reference to the Govern ment or application for its consent or permission. In the deeds of sale or transfer, delivered on this (*4.) P. M. R., p. 8?. 51"], [432, "398 occasion, there is no mention of, or reference to, the authority of the Government. When a Mirasidar dies, his son or heir enters immediately into the possession of his land, without any order or sanction from, or reference to, the Government and without the payment of any fine or acknowledgment what- ever. The right to the Mirasi is constantly brought into the courts of the Collector as it formerly was into the established courts of the country. It is claimed, defended and decided upon as regularly as any question relating to any other species of property. For debts to the State or to individuals, it is seized by the decree of the Collector or of the courts ancl sequestered or sold as the case may require.\" Mr. John Wallace, then Collector of the united districts of Tanjore and Trichinopoly, Avriting on the 8th September 1805, says : \u2014 (5) Without entering on the question of who is proprietor of the soil, I will content myself with stating that immemorial usage has established both in Tanjore and Trichinopoly that the occupants, whether distinguished by the name of Mirasidars or Maha j ens, have the right of selling, bestowing, dividing and bequeathing their lands in the manner which to them is most agree- able. Whether this right was granted originally by the ancient constitution of the country appears to me not worth considering at the present day. I think it is a fortunate circumstance that the right does at present exist, whether it originated in en- croachment on the sovereign's rights, in a wise and formal abrogation of those rights or in institutions coeval with the remotest antiquity. It is fortunate that, at a moment when we are consulting on the means of establishing the property and welfare of the numerous people of these provinces, we find the (5).

Mr. Hepburn, writing later on in 1819 says :(6) \" land has always been recognized here as private property and has always been considered as the most valuable of any.\" 5. Those cases in which Inams or tax-free tenures and the right of occupancy are united in one and the same party, are often pointed to as a phenomenon incompatible with the idea that pro- prietary occupancy was respected by the Hindu Governments ; it being taken for granted that in all these cases the prior occupants were summarily ejected either by the Government that made the grants or, with its aid, by the grantees. But the data from which this inference is drawn are, so far at least as Tanjore is concerned, inadequate. In the great majority of cases, the Inams are held by individuals and institutions different from the Mirasi occupants. Of those in which both the rights are united ; in some the grants expressly state that the occupancy right shall be purchased from the villagers and made over to the grantees ; in some it is found that compensation was made for the occupancy right given up by the villagers in a portion of the village by exempting the portion which they retained from the payment of revenue ; in some again it is observed that the grants made were of waste lands. In the remaining cases, which, (6.)

They are, with some very few exceptions, Brahmans of the Tamil speaking colony, who settled in the south during the Cola dynasty in the course of the thirteenth century. There is hardly a family of this colony which does not hold land on ordinary Mirasi tenure in Tanjore ;(7) while those who hold the Inam tenure likewise are comparatively very few. This priestly colony, on its first settlement, would na turally have sought for some settled and sure means of living, and agriculture is the very first thing that is likely to have recommended itself to it. During the days of Hindu dynasties, Brahmans were a favoured class ; they could not have been deficient in means to purchase and were evidently shrewd enough to see the value of landed property. It is also not unlikely that they in some cases acquired the right of Mirasi holding by gift of the Vellala proprie tary, in the manner indicated by Mr. Ellis. See p. 14, further on. 6. The distinctive feature of the Mirasi tenure, a (7). In the report of the Tanjore Committee above alluded to, the total number of Mirasidars at its date (1807) is given to be 62,048, distributed thus: \u2014 Brahmins ... ... ... ... ... 17,149 Ciidras, including Native Christians ... ... 43,442 Mahomedans .,. ... ... ... ... 1,457 Total... 62,048, the proportion of Brahmans being over 27 per cent. According to [the Jamabandi report for Fasli 1286 (A.D. 1876-77), the total number of Pattaa in Government villages excepting sixty into which they have not yet been introduced, is 136,532; but it does not appear whether the statistics given in the Committee's report are confined to Government villages or include also Inams. Taking the former to be the case and the proportion of Brahman Pattidars to bear now the same ratio to the total that it did in 1807, it cornea to 37,736. The number is certainly very large, seeing that the proportion of Brahmans to the entire population of the district is just 6-42 per cent. The great majority, however, as among other castes, are small holders, paying a revenue of Es, 10 and under."], [435, "401 feature as ancient apparently as the tenure itself, which still survives, is the division of the village into equal shares, each made up so as to yield an equal amount of produce and each including a propor tionate share of all the benefits of common property such as the use of village waste, mines, quarries, fisheries, forests and pasturage. Sales, mortgages and gifts of Mirasi shares, with all these incidental rights, are recognized and enforced by Courts of law. Sales of waste land alone, to the extent of course of the share of the alienor, have likewise been recogniz ed(8) but these last have been of rare occurrence, ap parently because there has not been much waste land in the delta ; while in the non-deltaic portion of the district, it is of very little value. 7. The ryotwari tenure now recognized in Tanjore as everywhere else in the Madras Presidency, prac tically possesses, so far as land occupied on patta is concerned, all the attributes of valuable and trans ferable property. The general question of ryot's rights to mines and quarries is at present under con sideration ; but it has no practical significance in Tanjore so far at least as its deltaic portion is con cerned, it being destitute of all minerals. 8. As regards unoccupied village waste, the ryot wari system does not recognize in its entirety the com munistic principle (an essential part of the Mirasi theory) which absolutely excludes strangers from the village boundaries ; it concedes to the Mirasidars only the refusal of the land when it is applied for by strangers, and the preferential claim thus con ceded is not held to interfere with the power of Government to appropriate any unoccupied land, (8).

In Chingleput, the Mirasidars have from the first all along maintained a claim to a fee or percentage of the produce, under the designation of Svamibhogamor Tunduvaram, on lands granted by Government to strangers, and this claim has been at last formally recognized, in so far as it relates to \" waste which may hereafter be brought under cultivation and to lands now occupied by non-Mirasidars which may hereafter be thrown up ancl again re-occupied under the Darkhast rules.\" In all such cases it has been decided, that the Svamibhogam payable to the Mirasi- dars, calculated at 2 annas in each rupee of the Government assessment, is to be recorded in the Patta issued to the occupant of the land, so that the Mirasidar may recover it from the latter through the Courts of law, if necessary. In Tanjore, however, no such claim has been advanced or recognized. The fact seems to be that in Tanjore the Darkhast rules are of comparatively recent origin. They are foreign to the revenue system, viz., village rents, which prevailed under the native Governments, and generally _also during the earlier- years of British rule. Under that system, the villagers engaged for a lump payment which included all assets and (9).

Where it is considered to reserve the land, a prohi bitory assessment is charged."], [437, "403 therefore left no opening for the intrusion of strang ers. Farther, there has been very little land in the Cauvery delta for strangers to take up on Darkhast. 10. Another peculiar privilege of Mirasi right recognized in Chingleput, which is unknown in Tanjore, is the enjoyment by the Mirasidars of a plot of land in Inam, that is free of assessment, as Kani Man^am or a perquisite of the Mirasi right. It is probable, that this special privilege was conceded at the first formation of the agricultural colony in Tondamundalam, in consideration of the uninviting character of the country, devoid of all natural advantages of irrigation. The Kani Manyam lands in Chingleput have been all enfranchised under the Inam rules. 11. It is fairly presumable, that proprietary agn- Agriculture at _\u00bb> - . . *\u25a0 . firBt the exclusive culture was at nrst vested as an exclusive calling m calling of veHai\u2122. a particular tribe ; since it was an essential feature of all early Indian institutions to make each occupation the exclusive calling of a particular class of people, and no reason appears for rejecting the concurrent testimony of traditions, that the class to whom was assigned agriculture, with all the privileges attached to it, were Veil alas. 12. The Revenue records do not show how the Their decline. total number of Ryotwari Pattas is distributed among the several castes. The census tables show, that the total number of Vellalas in Tanjore is 348,400, and that the adult males of this caste engag ed in agriculture are 81,687 against an aggregate of 256,366, made up of all castes ; but for reasons explained in the chapter on castes, the classification of the Cudra population with reference to castes can by no means be relied upon, and, as explained in the"], [438, "404 Mr. Ellis' account foot-note attached to the table of castes, neither are the sub-divisions* of castes as given in table No 11 of any value. There can be no doubt, however, that at present the proportion of pure Vellalas to the entire population of the district is very small. It seems worth while to consider how this important and inter esting class of the entire population has become so much attenuated. 13. Mr. Ellis accounts for the defalcation of the Vellala proprietary in Tondamandalam thus : \u2014 \"It has been already stated that, under the Govern ment by which the country was settled, the Vellalar only could hold landed property : to secure this, the right of pre-emption was vested in the joint pro prietors of the village, so that no stranger, even of their own caste, could obtain a settlement in it without the formal consent of the whole. When, however, it became a practice under the later Hindu dynasties to alienate the public revenue of whole villages or of large portions of them to Brahmans and others, this rule was relaxed ; the Brahman pro prietor of the Mel- varam directed his unremitted efforts to obtain the Kudivaram also which, from motives of superstition, fear or avarice on the part of the Ciidra-holder, he seldom failed to accom plish, and, as he could not himself conduct the labors of the field, he employed Pallis and others to cultivate the lands so obtained ; and these again, by consenting in later times to rent the village when the landlords had refused or by taking advantage of other favorable circumstances, have frequently succeeded in reducing their right to a nominal Svamib'hogam or in annihilating it al together. It is not intended to assert that the mode here stated was that in which all the Mirasi alienated"], [439, "405 passed from the original holders ; part was given directly by the latter to Brahmans and for the endowments of religious establishments and part was sold to persons of all descriptions ; the former practice being more frequent in remote, and the latter in recent, times. Moreover, the Canar, Pallis and others, admitted originally into the villages as Payakaris, have not unfrequently placed themselves in possession of the Mirasi ; sometimes by the failure of the Mirasidars, often by intrigue with the officers of revenue.\u2014 (P. M. R., pp. 250 and 251.) 14. This account may be considered to be appli- The state of cable to Tanjore except in so far as it relates to Brahmans. As regards these, the probable hy pothesis as already explained'11) is, that their acquisi tion of the right to the Mel-varam (ruler's share of the produce), where such was acquired by them, was preceded by their acquisition of the Kudi-varam (that is occupancy) right. The very small propor tion of Inams to the number of Ryotwari Pattas held by Brahmans in Tanjore is alone sufficient to negative the contrary supposition. Elsewhere, the alienations of revenue made by the Hindu Governments were, for the most part, resumed on the Mahomedan con quest, and the proprietary occupancy of the lands was continued to the Brahmans with an increas ed rate of Kudi-varamO2), and thus on the British assumption of the country, rates of varam varying with the castes of the ryots were found. In Tanjore, there was no Mahomedan conquest, and therefore no resumption of the alienations of the public revenue ; no variation of varam with reference to caste either. 03) Neither have the Brahmans in Tanjore (11). See p 5 ante. (12). Note 20 to Mr. Ellis' paper on Mirasi. P. M. E , p. 250. (13), See report ofthe Tanjore Committee, dated 22nd Feb. 1807, para 22, 52"], [440, "406 lost their holdings to any considerable extent in the manner indicated by Mr. Ellis. There must have been isolated instances of their having been dispossessed by Cddra classes, as there are villages of which the names have the suffix \" agharam,\" (the Tamil word for Brahman village, being a contraction of the Sanskrit \" agraharam\"), but which are now wholly, or for the most part, destitute of Brahmans; but generally speaking, the Tamil-speaking Brahmans in Tanjore are too shrewd and sagacious to be over reached, and too firm and pertinacious to give way to intrigue or violence. 15. Reverting to the decline of Vellalas, they probably in some cases gave away their lands to Brahmans \" from motives of superstition, fear or avarice\" ; but apparently, the bulk of their hold ings passed directly into the hands of the non- Brahmanical classes. Of these classes, the most prominent are Kallars, a recent colony from the wild country to the south, and next perhaps to these are Padeiyaccis, a class of immigrants from the countries north ofthe Colleroon. These two classes of settlers, during the feeble and corrupt administration of Ameer Sing in the latter end of the last century, found means to possess themselves of the lands of weaker ryots. To their profession of robbery, they in many cases united the powers of Kavali or rural police, and while thus, on the one hand, they had means to purchase, on the other they were masters ofthe art of inducing the timid and peaceable to part with their lands. Speaking of the Kavalgars who were almost wholly Kallars and Padeiyaccis ; the Commissioners, in their report of the 31st January 1799, say (para 26): \u2014 \" The plunder of the villagers' property was followed by depredations on that of the Sarkar, and the Cawlcarra growing rich in spoil, was no longer"], [441, "407 contented with his original character, but aspired to the respectability of a landholder, and ultimately has, in some instances, become a Pathakdar ; under various contrivances, he possesses himself of land ; as his neighbours become poor either from his rob beries or from other causes, he offers them money for their expenses, and seldom fails to demand repayment in such a manner as to make their land the forfeit.\" Even now, nobody, not himself a Kallar, would be the willing neighbour of a Kallar ryot ; for the old fear of the tendency of the Kallar's holding to swallow up those of his neighbours is not yet quite extinct. 16. Moreover, the events of Hvder's invasion in Opening afforded to interlopers by tho 1781 afforded to the hordes of Kallars from the south desolating effects of and other interlopers a wide opening for gaining foot- ' ings in the delta and forming holdings which, in course of time, under a settled Government and with Courts of justice which upheld all existing possessions against violence and arbitrary power, became secure and valuable properties. Xo doubt in some, proba bly in the majority of, ca, es, the new settlers filled vacancies for which there were no living owners ; but in the arrangements which it adopted for re peopling those parts which had become depopulated, the native Government, in the state of bankruptcy to which it had been then reduced, is not likely to have shown much regard, except perhaps in the case of Brahmans, to rights of property, where such were asserted or were traceable. Very probably, therefore, in many cases, old Mirasidars, deprived of everything that was moveable of their possessions and unable to resume cultivation without aid or indulgence in regard to the \" Sarkar\" demand, were superseded by enterprising settlers to whom any terms on which they could acquire property in land"], [442, "408 Tenures of holdings, were so much an advantage. Thus Ryotwari rights arose in many cases in Tanjore in much the same way as elsewhere, that is, Payakari settlers who were engaged to cultivate as renters under temporary arrangements eventually became proprietary holders. On the whole, the difference seems to consist in this : that, while in most other districts the general body of ryot proprietors are the growth of the concluding part of the last and commencement of the present century ; in Tanjore, as likewise in Chingleput, they are distributable into three classes : firstly, pure Vellalas who represent a fraction of the ancient proprie tary ; secondly, Tamil Brahmans who represent the Priestly colony that partly supplanted the Vellalas in the thirteenth and later centuries, and thirdly, the general Palli class whose rise commenced per haps in part during the declining days of the C61a dynasty in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but who for the most part gained their footings in the latter end of the last century. 17. In the Committee's report, dated 22nd Febru ary 1807-, the number of villages in Tanjore is stated to have then been 5,783, divided into three groups thus : \u2014 E'kab'hdgam or villages of which the sole oc- cupancy was vested in one individual ... 1,807 Arudikkarei or villages held by a number of individuals in separate shares ... ... 2,202 Samudayam or Pasunkarei villages held in common ... ... ... ... ... 1,774 The villages of the first group were mostly hamlets or detached portions of villages properly so called. (14) In the recent revision of village establishments (G. 0., (14) \" In his impatience of control and desire to make himself independ ent of his neighbours, it was the fashion under former Governments for every Mirasidar of any consequence to obtain the sanction of the ruling power to constitute his individual holding, however small, into a separate"], [443, "409 8th October 1867), all those so-called villages have been clubbed together and have ceased to be counted as separate villages ; the total number being thus reduced to 3,935. By this arrangement and by the operation of the course of sub-division, the designa tion of E'kab'hdgam or sole property (literally the possession of one single individual) has now disap peared. The second group comprised villages held in severalty with individual ownership and indivi dual liability for the payment of Government dues. This, to all intents and purposes, was Ryot wari tenure. The villages of the third group were sub-divided into two minor heads : \" Samudayam\" properly so called and Kareiyidu ; the first com prising those villages which were cultivated by joint stock of labor, cattle and implements, the produce being shared by the members of the village community or Mirasi holders . according to their respective shares ; the second those of which the lands were temporarily distributed by lot into separate shares and were subject to re-distribution at stated periods of five to thirty years. In Tanjore, the term \" Samudayam\" has in later times been applied exclusively to villages of the minor group first men tioned and \" Kareiyidu,\" spoken of as a distinct major head. This is evidently a more logical division, and the tenures in relation to co-sharers, which require to be considered, therefore, are : \u2014 \u25a0 (1). Samudayam, or enjoyment in common. (2). Kareiyidu, a temporary allotment of lands in shares, with the incident of periodical re-distribution. (3). Arudikkarei or holding in severalty. village called after his own or some other favourite name. Hence villages * * * comprising, in some instances, less than an acre and without any houses or habitations, came into existence.\" \u2014 Collector's letter on village establishments, dated 22nd January 1861."], [444, "410 18. The Samudayam tenure evidently represents the earliest or initiatory stage of agricultural insti- tutions ; out of it developed Kareiyidu, and out of Kareiyidu, Arudikkarei. As Mr. H. J. Stokes, in his paper to be presently noticed, observes, the tem- porary allotment of lands was at first probably made anew each year ; a system which, according to Mr. Place, prevailed in some of the richest villages in Chingleput at the date of his report, viz. 1799.(15) The two earlier stages have now almost disap- peared, and Arudikkarei or holding in distinct and permanently allotted shares is almost the only system that now obtains throughout the district. The manner in which, under the Kareiyidu system, the lands are re-distributed by lot, is described in full detail in an interesting paper drawn up by Mr. Stokes, while Sub-Collector of Tanjore, and it will be found in the Appendix. 19. There is nothing to show to what extent the Samudayam tenure prevailed at the time the district came under British rule. The Commissioners, in their report dated 31st January 1799, say \" the inhabitants have the option of each tenure, but as they seldom agree among themselves, their villages are mostly reduced to Arudikkarei which better suits their litigious dispositions * * *,\" and hence it is clear that the Samudayam tenure had even at that date survived but to a very small extent. 20. There is likewise no record to show in what villages the Samudayam and Kareiyidu tenures exist at present ; the former may be found perhaps in a few isolated instances in which the regular system of Ryotwari Pattas has not yet been introduced ; the latter is probably more prevalent.

The most significant incident of the Samu- joint liability for j/ , ..-i \u2022\u2022j.Ti-i-j. i-i iii c the Government re uayam tenure is the joint liability or shareholders iorvemie. the Government revenue, and this liability may exist also where the village lands are held in severalty, but the mode of settlement with respect to revenue is of the nature of joint rent. 22. There is very little information on record as to the modes of settlement which prevailed during the days of the native Government ; but it may be observed that an individual contract with each land holder was totally inconsistent with the communistic principle which governed the internal management of all village affairs. As already stated, the Commis sioners who instituted enquiries into the subject in the year 1798 reported that they had not been able to obtain any information anterior to the year 1773. During the period which intervened between that date and the cession of the district to the British rule in 1799, the modes of management by which the public revenue was realized were : \u2014 (1) Amani or division of the produce with the laud-holders ; (2) Village rents collected under a direct settlement with the land-holders as a body; and (3) The Pat'hak system, under which the Government contracted with a middle man, designated Pat'hakdar, for the revenue of a group of villages, and in some cases for each individual village. This last system will be more fully described in its proper place ; but evi dently a joint liability on the part of all land-holders was the necessary fea- ture of the second and third."], [446, "412 23. From the cession of the district to the year 1822, when the Olungu system involving a distinct recognition, and consequently necessitating a distinct record, of individual liability was introduced ; the modes of settlement adopted were Amani and vil lage rents, with the exception that in four years (1804 to 1807) Pattas were granted to individual Mirasidars in all those cases in which the village lands were held in severalty, while in those \"where the Samudayam tenure prevailed, the Mirasidars were held each responsible'for the proportion of the rent according to the number of shares he held in the vil lage.'^16) Under villlage rents, the recognized theory of the revenue tenure was joint liability; but it seems little likely that such liability was, if at all, strictly enforced. The plan adopted in 1804-1807 shows, that means were not wanting for defining individual responsibility iord the Government dues. The Col lector, Mr. Hepburn, in his letter to the Board of Revenue, dated 12th August 1819, says (para. 51) : \"It (the joint responsibility) has never yet in any instance been carried to the length of selling the lands of any one Mirasidar for the default of another.\" 24. Indeed, under the system of rent in kind, there could have been no default, as the practice invariably observed was to collect the rent before the grain was removed from the threshing floor and, under the ancient, well defined system of holding in village shares, each made over his own share of the grain. When the rent was payable in money, it does appear that defaults resulting in sales of land occasionally took place ; but from the Collector's distinct assertion above quoted, it is presumable that a record was kept of each individual's payments (16). Eeport of the Committee dated 22nd February 1807, para 9."], [447, "413 as well as of his share of the gross rent. Where the village lands were held in severalty, which was even then more generally the case, there could have been no difficulty in identifying the fields or plots of land which constituted each holding. Where, on the other hand, the lands were held in common and the produce alone shared under the \" Samudayam\" system, the sale need not have extended beyond the defaulter's interest in the particular share in the Samudayam title. It is indeed extremely improba ble, that the Mirasidars of Tanjore possessing, as they have always demonstrably done, a thorough knowledge of their rights as well as of the value of their property, would have consented to a proceed ing which inflicted on one loss of property for the default of another, or would have at all agreed to a contract of which, they believed, such proceeding was the necessary consequence. 25. An idea seems to be entertained that a joint liability was an essential part of the theory of the Olungu system which prevailed in the greater part of the district until the year 1859 and even of the Mottamfaisal system by which it was then supersed ed. This is a mistake. These systems will be des cribed at length under the head of Administration ; it is sufficient here to observe, that the peculiar mode of granting remissions under either was in compatible with any but a perfect recognition of in dividual liability. Although there were no Pattas or Chithas, in every Government village there was a general register of holdings called B'hagavi vara Kanakku ; there was an annual rent-roll, called Cultivation Mucelika, in which the extent of land held by each individual was recorded and his signa ture taken; there was also a regular register of transfers of land, called \"Mirasi Padivu Register,\" 53"], [448, "414 and the Karnam kept a regular account of demand and collection in detail of holdings, by means of which the balance outstanding against any individual was readily ascertainable. 26. The Samudayam tenure, where it existed, of course applied to village lands generally. But in almost every village, there is a small piece of land called \" Grama Samudayam\" or village common. It is the common property of the village community, but too small to be divided amongst them. It is gener ally a piece of Padugei land (the space between the river embankment and deep water), a threshing floor no longer needed for that purpose or a detached piece of high level land, originally classed as purampdk, on which a dry crop is sown. The produce of such land is generally assigned to the village pagoda, the village choultry or water pandal, or any other com munal purpose. In some cases, the area, as well as the assessment of the land, is entered in individual Pattas in rateable proportions ; in others a joint Patta. is issued. In the cases last mentioned, the Patta, is called \" Samudayapatta,\" and the share holders are held both severally and jointly respon sible for the assessment due to Government; but it rarely happens that the assessment is left unliquidated so as to necessitate resort to coercive process. Joint Pattas in the names of joint heirs are almost unknown."], [449, "415 PART III. CHAPTER IV. VILLAGE ESTABLISHMENT. The village establishment, as it existed when , . Original constitu. \u00b0 . . turn of the Establish- Tanjore came under British rule, was confined ment. strictly to the service of the village community and included no agency partaking of the character of a representative of Government or Revenue agent. It consisted of : \u2014 (1) Karnam (accountant.) (2) Niranikyam or Nirgunti (distributor of water for irrigation), (3) Talayar (village watcher), (4} Vettyan (village scavenger), (5) Doctor, (6) Pattigar (stray cattle watcher), (7) Washerman, (8) Barber, (9) Carpenter and (10) Smith. This was the ordinary complement of the smallest village properly so called ; it did not include a potter or a goldsmith, probably from its having been usual from the first, as it is now, to procure earthenware from the nearest manufactory and to resort to the nearest town or large village for the luxury of mak- ing jewels. 2. The constitution of the village Government No Chief or Head was essentially a body democratic. There was no Chief or headman corresponding to the Potel of the Mahratta country and Mysore, the Peddakapu of the Northern Cirkars, or the Raddi of the Ceded Districts."], [450, "416 The first creation of the office of Head- man. Neither the report of the Commissioners appointed in 1798/1) nor any of the other early records exhibit a trace of such an office having ever existed in this dis trict. As observed by that accurate observer, Mr. Ellis, with regard to the Tamil country generally; \" his (the Chief's) duties are discharged by the village Senate, Gramapraverticam, by which all the affairs of the community, internal and external, are con ducted : in this assembly every proprietor has a seat and a voice, each possessing a right to the manage ment of the general business of the community, as to every other privilege, in proportion to his share in it.\"(2) Even now, no action in relation to the affairs of a village is taken without the concurrence of all the members of the community. It is either taken thus or not at all ; the latter being now generally the case. In all transactions relating to rent settlements (these were of constant recurrence until the extension of the Mottamfaisal settlement throughout the dis trict in 1859, as the rents were generally for terms of years), the negotiations with the officers of Go vernment were conducted not by one man as repre sentative of all, but by a deputation consisting of a number of Mirasidars. 3. The first attempt to establish the office of Village Munsiff, with Police and Judicial functions, was made in 1816, when the Regulations of the Madras Code of that year were passed ; but notwith standing all the efforts then made, under peremptory (1). The Commissioners speak of Vattam Maniagars, and from the tenor of their observations, it is inf erible, that such an office existed sometime before the date of their report ; but apparently the Vattam Maniagar was a Eevenue agent, appointed to collect the Government dues, with charge of a group of villages, somewhat like the present Government Vattam Karnam. The Commissioners say (para. 30), \"it is in the memory of the present ser vants of the Palace when these Kavalgars were at the call, and obedient to the orders, of a Vattam Maniagar.\" The Kavalgars whose individual range extended over a large tract of country could not have been at the call of each village officer.

The Collector experienced the greatest difficulty in inducing one of the principal Mira sidars to undertake the office. In fact, however imposing the title, the office was not, or at least was not regarded to be, an enviable one. It was not merely that no emolument was attached to it ; the Mirasidars were shrewd enough to see that he who accepted the office should, to a great extent, be at the call of the superior officers of Police, that he should have often to travel to the Zilla Court as wit ness in criminal cases and get into trouble by con fessions of guilt made before him being retracted and attributed to torture or other improper means. (4) 4. It was, however, not until 1836 that the head of the village was made also an agent for the collection of the public revenue under the designa tion and title of Pattamaniagar, generally called Pat tamaniyam, imported apparently from Coimbatore, with a salary from the public treasury, of which the rates as first fixed varied from Rs. 7 to 42, and as afterwards revised, from Rs. 3 to 97, per annum. (5) 5. This latter measure proved little more suc cessful than that of 1816, and the utter uselessness of the office, as well in the matter of the collection of Government kists as in Police and Judicial ad ministration, continued to be the subject of com plaint in all quarters.

Lee-Morris, wrote as follows : \u2014 \" Mirasidars of wealth and standing very seldom live in these villages (those containing twenty houses and under of which the greater part belong to agricultural laborers) even though they may possess land there, and the selection of Pattamaniyam has therefore been restricted to either a large Mirasidar's agent or some petty Mirasi- dar who has but little property and less intelligence. The consequences have been that but few heads of villages are really competent men and fewer still really perform any of their duties properly. They are in many instances unable to collect the revenue because other Mirasidars have no confidence in them and will not pay their moneys into their hands. They do not decide any petty suits, because they either do not know how to do so or the people would rather go some distance to a District Munsiff's Court or the Court of Small Causes than have recourse to them.\"(7) 6.

Better salaries have led to the office being to some extent sought after, and its duties, so far as the collection of kists is concerned, are more or less regularly performed by the Pattamaniyam ; at the same time the present heavy scale of Court fees on suits brought before a regular tribunal has oper ated to induce the lower classes of people to submit small suits for money or personal property of the value of Rs. 10 and under to the head of the village in his capacity of Village Munsiff.(7a) The object, however, of creating a village headman that com mands the respect of the Mirasidars, enjoys their confidence and acts as their representative in the management of the affairs of the. village, is yet far from being reached. As a rule, each village is divided into factions and the Munsiff Pattamaniyam is looked upon by one of them with distrust and jealousy; he is not always one of the principal Mirasidars, for these do not still generally seek for or accept the office. 7. The office of Karnam, as part of the old village institution, was purely that of a private accountant employed to keep the private accounts of the Mira sidars, and there are even now traces of such office under the designation of \" Kudikarnam\" as dis tinguished from the \" Sarkar Karnam,\" in the Pattukkdttei taluk, where the ryots, from their comparative ignorance and the large size of the villages, cannot afford to dispense with assistance in this shape. The Commissioners (1799) com plain particularly of the absence in Tanjore of all rural agency to look after the interests of Go vernment.

Latterly, as the arrange ment under which the Karnams collected their own remuneration was found inconvenient, their combined emoluments were, from 1820, collected along with Government revenue and thrown into a fund, from which they were paid at monthly rates subject to adjustment at the close of each year when the actual amount of the realizations was ascertained/10) Later on, in 1830, their salaries were fixed once for all with reference to the average of actual payments during a series of years.*11) And finally, in 1852, the Karnam's fund was, as in other cognate cases, incor porated with the revenues of the State, and their sala ries became a direct charge on the State exchequer. The Karnam's establishment was enlarged in 1851 and was finally settled at its present strength at the last revision of the Government Village establishment in 1868, which will be more fully noticed hereafter. 8. The Talayar or watcher was likewise, as he is now, a private servant of the village community. By the early Police Regulation (XI of 1816), he was declared to be part of the regular Police esta blishment; but practically, he did little more of Police duties than did the head of the village. Even tually, in 1860, when the Mofussil Police was reor ganized, all claims to the services of the Talayar as (8). The Honorable Mr. Pelly's Memorandum, 2nd May 1861, para. 3 (C V.

As will be seen hereafter, a moiety of the Talayars Svatantram or fee has been resumed and appropriated for the Govern ment Village establishment. Besides this grain fee, in some instances, the Government assessment on certain lands had been assigned for the support of the Talayar. These assignments, known as \" Talayari Manyam,\" aggregated 604 acres bearing an assess ment of Rs. 1,242,*13) and they have been enfran chised under the Inam rules at a quit-rent equal to f-ths of the full assessment. 9.

Marakkals are fractions of kalam and 12 make one kalam. It will be seen that the second set of percentages (3 kalams) are calculated not on 100 kalams of the produce, but on 91 kalams remaining after the first set (9 kalams) have been deducted and that their actual proportion comes, therefore, to 2 kalams and 8f marakkals. It will be seen also, that the Talayar and the Police come in both sets ; the aggregate of the two percentages being : \u2014 For Talayar 5-64 marakkal or '47 per cent., and For the Police 1 kalam and 6' 92 marakkals, or 1'58 per cent. The second percentage allowance in these cases is probably a later addition consequent on the first being found insufficient. 10.

For Punsei or dry grains it varies slightly, the difference consisting chiefly in the allowance for reaping, which is higher"], [457, "423 being 6 kalams and 3 marakkals or 6\\ per cent., against 4 kalams and 2 marakkals or i\\ per cent. for Nansei. 11. These percentage fees go by the name of \" Poduccilavu\" or common charges, (i . e., charges common to Government and the Mirasidars), and upon the theory that Government and the Mirasi dars are entitled to equal shares of the produce, the latter including the cost of cultivation except in so far as it is covered by these percentage fees ; it is assumed that of these percentages a half is the con tribution of Government and the other half that of the Mirasidars. These percentages were regulated and settled by the first Collector, Mr. Harris, upon the British assumption of the province, in accordance generally, it is to be presumed, with the prevailing usages as then ascertained by that Officer. It is to be observed, however, that previously, the contributions of the Mirasidars for the Kaval or Police were not regulated by any fixed scale, but varied with the powers of exaction which the Kavalgars possessed and exercised, and that their contribution for the support of Pagodas and Brahmans varied in different parts of the district, being made in some cases in the shape of assignment of the entire produce of particular fields and in others of percent- ages on the entire produce of the village.*14) These two items were, on the cession of the district, reduced to uniform percentages as shown in tho table above. Except in these two cases and that of the Karnam, the Government have never under taken to control actual disbursements, but have left them entirely to the Mirasidars, and the latter (14).

As regards other village servants, they have in some cases discontinued all payments ; the village doctor and Pattigar have in several places disappeared altogether. The employment and dismissal of the village servants have always rested with the Mirasi dars themselves. 12. Subsequently, the village Svatantrams or percentage fees have been dealt with by the British Government as follows : \u2014 - 13. The Karnam's fee of 2 marakkals or ith per cent, on the gross produce was resumed, as already stated, in 1807, and was merged in the assets for the remuneration of the office of the present Government Karnam. 14. The Kavali fee was resumed in the year 1814 for appropriation to the regular Police then organised. In the later years of the period during which it was maintained as a separate fund, the proceeds of this fee averaged Rs. 1, 81,000. 15. The Svatantram or allowance for Pagodas and Brahmans, the proceeds of which during the similar years averaged about Rs. 50,000, was, down to the year 1857, collected by Government, and payments were made to Pagodas and Brah mans according to a fixed scale. In 1857, it was abolished.*15) In the case of Pagodas, it was (15).

The Collector, however, reported, that it would be inconvenient to invite for settlement once for all the numerous claims to the small yearly allow ances from the Pagoda Svatantram fund and pro posed to deal with each claim as it was brought for ward. This proposal was sanctioned, and eventually such claims as the Pagodas had to annual payments under this head merged in the general commutation of all money allowances to native religious institu tions into assignments of land revenue. *15a-) In the case of Brahmans, the annual payments had become reduced by lapses to a sum much below the amount collected, and such payments as then continued to be made from the public treasury were reduced to a half, as that much was the share of Government in the abolished Svatantram.*16) The charge upon the treasury under this head has now, by the gradual defalcation of the recipients, all but ceased. 16.

The doctor and Pattigar had ceased to exist, or at any rate to be paid, as part of the village institution, and the rest had become entirely private servants of the Mirasidars and were not available for any State service, in which case alone the Government were bound to contribute for their support. 18. The effect of the abolition of the percentage fees for Pagodas and Brahmans and for the village poor was to add moieties of them to the respective shares of Government and the Mirasidars out of the gross produce as till then calculated, and the effect of the resumption of a moiety of those specified in the preceding para, was to increase the Government share and to reduce the Mirasidar's share of the pro duce pro tanto.

It will be seen that the Mirasidar's share, viz., 53 per cent, of the gross produce includes the cost of cultivation. To the value of the Govern ment share, however, must be added a small money cess levied for the remuneration of a body of ser vants, called Nattukarnams, which will be noticed further on. 19. Until the year 1851, separate accounts were kept of receipts and disbursements for each fee col lected and administered by Government; but in 1852 they were all merged in the general land revenue, and the disbursements under each head, according to a scale then fixed and sanctioned by Government, became a direct charge on the Treasury. The later resumptions (p. 17) have, in like manner, merged in the general land revenue. 20. The present Government Village establish ment consists of a Munsiff Maniagar, a Karnam, and a Vettyan*17) or more properly a village peon, for each of the 1,446 Vattams or consolidated town ships, into which the villages are grouped. The 1,446 Vattams are divided into four classes, with reference to their size and importance, and for each class, the salary of the establishment (paid monthly (17). This Vettyan is entirely different from the Mirasidar's Vettyan, who continues to be their private servant. \"Vettyan\" was the name as pro posed and sanctioned for the newly created servant ; but the name locally adopted is \" Vicharippukkaran\" corresponding to that of the inferior Revenue Peons on the old establishment."], [463, "429 in like manner with other Government establish ments) is fixed thus : \u2014 Total cost per annum Rs. 2,76,048.<18< 21.

It was a cess originally intended for the remuneration of a numerous class of taluk officials, called Nattu karnams,*20) which no longer exists. The origin of this class is not clearly ascertainable, as there is no record relating to it. It is stated that, during the days of the native Government and also for some time after the British assumption of the district, it was usual for the Mirasidars to employ agents of their own, under the name of Samprati, Hejib, &c,f in the taluk Kacceries to procure for them informa tion as to the accounts kept of their cultivation, the Government demand on and the collections made from them and generally to represent their interests in the head-quarters of taluks ; and that it was out of this body of Mirasidars' delegates that the Nattu karnams arose.*21) What is known for certain, however, is, the Nattukarnams, whatever may have been the nature of their duties originally, were paid at first by the Mirasidars, and that in the year 1820, the fees which they were receiving were, by an (20).

E.,p. 665.)"], [465, "431 order of the Collector, commuted into a regular money cess, varying in different taluks, but bearing on the whole a percentage of 10 as. and 10 p. on the revenue.*22) This cess was collected by Government and formed into a fund, from which the Nattukarnams were paid monthly salaries, and if they ever had been the private agents of the Mirasidars, they thence forward ceased to be such and became entirely Government servants. They were after this em ployed chiefly as accountants in taluk Kacceries, but were often detailed on duties of inspection. Latterly, the Nat .ukarnam establishment was en larged, as the proceeds of the cess levied for their remuneration had increased, and clerks, writers and accountants were employed also in the Huzur out of the Nattukarnam fund. Eventually, in 1868, when the village establishment was revised, the Nattu karnam staff was abolished ; its cess having been taken into account in the computation of the assets available for it. 23. It will be seen, that out of the various assets enumerated in para. 21, all but items 3 and 10 are charges wholly on the revenue ; of item 3 (Rs. 15,622) a moiety is, upon the theory mentioned in para. 11, the contribution of the Mirasidars ; item 10 (Rs. 34,845) is solely contributed by them. As already stated, all are merged in the general land revenue ; but under a recent order, the whole amount of the cost of the village establishment is deducted from it in detail of Pattas and credited to the Village Service fund to which are debited all payments to the esta blishment as they are made.

There is very little information regarding the system of Government observed by the native rulers, and such as is available is restricted to the Mahratta rule which immediately preceded the British ; there being absolutely nothing on record with respect to the Cola or the Nayak dynasties. 2. It appears that, during the reign of the first Mahratta Raja, Yekoji, in 1675, it was divided into five fiscal divisions, called Sub'has, viz., Tiruvadi, Combaconum, Mayaveram, Mannargudi and Pattuk kottei including Vallampattu,*1) each under the charge of an officer designated Sub'hedar. The Tanjore territory had at that date not extended much beyond Pattukk6ttei, south or west. At the cession of the province in 1799, its fiscal divisions were the same as above-mentioned, though their boundaries had be come altered.*2) In one case (the Pattukkottei Sub'ha) they had been extended by annexations from the Marava country, and in two reduced by European Settlements formed on the Coast, during the inter mediate period.*3) 3 . It must be here observed that, before the cession of the whole country by Raja Sarabhoji, the two Sub'has of Mayaveram and Mannargudi had, under the Treaty with Amarsing, dated 11th June 1793, been taken under the charge of the officers of the Company for arrears of subsidy.

Divik k6ttei, with the adjoining English District of Cud dalore, formed one administrative division and was administered by Mr. Taylor. The rest of the Tanjore territory was transferred to the Company by Raja S'arabhoji by Treaty, dated 25th October, and ratified by the Governor-General in Council on the 26th November, 1799, and was taken possession of by the officers of the Company at the beginning of 1800 ; when the whole country, with the older English possessions, including also the adjoining dis trict of Cuddalore, as well as Kareikkal, was formed into two divisions or \" Collectorships\"(4) thus : \u2014 Southern Division. 1.

Tranquebar had in the meantime been placed under a separate Commissioner, and in 1 8 15 it was restored to the Danish ; it came again into the possession of the English by purchase in 1845. Kareikkal was restored to the French in 1816. The only other change of territory subsequent to the British acquisition of the province, which needs to be here noticed, is the transfer of the small district of Kilanelli in Pattukkottei to Raja Tondaman of Pu dukdttei in 1803. 4. The administrative sub-divisions under the British Government have from time to time un dergone changes. In 1801, the five Sub'has which constituted the entire territory ceded by the Eija were each, with the exception of Pattukkottei, divid ed into a number of taluks, and the total number of such taluks was forty ; the Sub'ha of Pattukk6ttei had no sub-divisions.

The District thus consisted of sixteen taluks until the last general revision of Revenue establishments throughout the Presidency by Mr. Pelly in 1860, when the taluks were reduced again to nine, their present number. For the first twenty years after the cession of the Raja's territory, the two early English Settlements of Divikkdttei and Nagur (including Negapatam), as also the French Settlement of Kareikkal so long as it remained in the occupation of the English, continued to be distinct administra tive divisions ; but they were latterly merged in the adjoining taluks, though for the purpose of determining the one-fifth share of the net revenues payable to the Raja, they continued to be distinguished in the financial accounts until the extinction of the Raj in 1855 when that payment ceased.

It does not appear, that during the Mahratta government, the collection of the public revenue and the administration of justice were united in the same agency.*7) Originally, the Sub'hedars probably combined the functions of Military Governors with those of Collectors of Revenue; but such arrange ment, if it ever existed, had ceased when the province came under British rule, and the functions of these officers were then restricted to the collection of the revenue. On the assumption of the government by the British, the general administration, Revenue, Judicial and Police, was vested in one authority under the designation of \"Collector\" and so remained until the establishment of an independent Court of (7).

Until 1854 the Collector had charge of the Postal Department and until 1857*8) of the general Public \"Works executive in addition. Since the middle of the century, two new departments, each under a distinct controlling head at the Presidency, were created : the Educational in 1854 and the Registra tion in 1865. 7. The Revenue history of the Collectorate will be found in full detail in the following chapter ; but this seems a fitting place for a brief sketch of the administrative machinery. 8. The Collectorate is divided, as already men tioned, into nine taluks or tahsil charges, over each of which is a Tahsildar for executive work. The Tahsildar of Tanjore is assisted by three Deputies ; the other two most important taluks (Combaconum and Negapatam) have two each, and the rest except ing Shiyali, the smallest taluk in the district which has no Deputy Tahsildar, one each. The Tahsil dars, as well as their Deputies, are Magistrates of the second or third class. For supervisory control, the nine taluks are formed into five divisions, each under the charge of a Covenanted or Uncovenanted Officer subordinate to the Collector, with conter minous Revenue and Magisterial jurisdictions ; the (8).

This department of administration, whatever may have been its defects in previous times, appears to have been conducted, at the date of the British acquisition of the province, in a satisfactory manner. The Commissioners appointed in 1798 to enquire into the state ofthe country, say: \u2014 \" The administra tion of Civil Justice formerly centred in a single Judge, first appointed to sit at Tanjore by Pretaub Sing, on a salary of thirty Porto Novo Pagodas monthly, with an establishment of Conicopolies and Mootsiddies for the purpose of registering decrees from which an appeal might be made to the Rajah who generally referred them to his Sirkeel or some other principal officer, and the Judge seems to have been under no other check or control for the punc tual discharge of his trust. This loose and irregular system prevailed during the whole of Tuljagee's reign and some time after Ameer Sing's accession. Mr. Swartz, with that consideration for the welfare of the inhabitants, which forms the prominent feature of his benevolent career, whether actuated by an idea of the impolicy of so much power centering in one person, or by the conviction that that power was abused, repeatedly urged the necessity of instituting a Court of Justice at Tanjore, which he at last had the satisfaction to effect through the influence of Sir Archibald Campbell.\" \" That Court at present exists under the name of Ninee's Mahl, and its form of proceeding is by com-"], [475, "441 plaint, answer and decree. It consists of a Presi dent and four Judges whose pay and establishment of servants are exhibited in Paper E. The Court sits daily and takes cognizance of all Civil cases which are provided for by the laws of the Shaster, if the parties cannot be prevailed on to refer their cause to an arbitration composed of the Heads of their respective castes, which is generally recom mended for the despatch of business ; but an award, whether of the Judges or of the Arbitrators, is read in open Court and after being signed is liable to the rejection of the Rajah. The Court is empow ered to levy five per cent, on all claims of money alone, and to fine to any amount not exceeding 120 chuckrams on disputed real property, which is paid by the loser and generally limited by his means or by any palliating circumstances that may arise in the course of his defence ; this forms a fund to defray the salaries of the Judges, &c, and all incidental expenses of the Court. However much the adminis tration of justice may have been obstructed in Ameer Sing's time by the influence of his favorite, Sheverow, we have reason to believe that little, if any, abuse exists at present. The attention shown by the Rajah Sherfojee to revise every decree has, to this period since his accession, precluded the neces sity of appeal except in one instance, a cause of fifty chuckrams.\" \" In villages at a distance from Tanjore, in case the parties cannot agree among themselves by private arbitration, they have recourse to the Zilladar sta tioned at the Cusbah village of each Soubah, who names arbitrators to adjust the dispute, from whose award a way is open for an appeal to the Rajah. An abstract of these proceedings is transmitted monthly to the Palace, and the Rajah reserves to himself the"], [476, "442 right of reversing any that may appear to him unjust. This regulation in favor of distant parts of the coun try has been recently established by Sirfojee and applies to the Soubahs now under his control. Nevertheless, we conceive the institution of inferior Courts at the Cusbahof each Soubah, consisting of a President and four Judges, would operate as a check on the Zilladar and better contribute to the security of the inhabitants. The forms, &c, observed by the Court at Tanjore, we recommend, should be modified in a way to apply to the extent of jurisdic tion of the inferior Courts from whose decision there should be allowed an appeal to the Rajah.\" \" The Criminal Justice in this as in every other country government rests with the Prince who has the power to institute an enquiry into the offence of the culprit and may afterwards enforce or not the punishment prescribed by the Shaster, and on this principle, while administered with firmness and a due regard to mercy, is well calculated to prevent the frequent recurrence of crimes. The few instances of capital punishment since Pretaub Sing's accession to the Musnud in some degree justify this opinion. On that ground, we recommend that the Criminal Justice at Tanjore should remain on its present foot ing, but should any additional regulations in this department be deemed necessary, we are of opinion they should be framed to strengthen the arm of Government, in order to curb the refractory spirit prevailing through the country.\" 10. As already stated, for the first six years after the assumption of the government by the British, the judicial administration was vested in the Col lector. In 1806, under the early enactments of the Madras Code, was established at Combaconum a Court of Civil Judicature presided over by a European"], [477, "443 Judge, under the designation of \" Zilla Court,\" subject to the controlling authority of a Provincial Court of Appeal, whose range comprised two or more Zillas or Collectorates. The trial of criminal cases and the general Jail Delivery were vested in the Provincial Court in its capacity of \" Court of Circuit.\" The Zilla Judge was also constituted Magistrate, as well as Superintendent of Police, of the district. In 1816, the two last-mentioned offices were trans ferred to the Collector,*9) and the Zilla Judge was invested with the powers of a Criminal Judge within certain limits*10) which were subsequently enlarged. In 1827, the Zilla Judge was provided with an auxiliary Court, presided over by a European Assis tant, with powers, civil as well as criminal,*11) co ordinate with his own. In 1843, the Zilla Court was raised to the status till then held by the Provin cial Court of Appeal and Circuit, under the designa tion of \" Civil and Session Court,\" and the auxiliary Court to that of the Zilla Court under the altered title of \"Subordinate Court;\" at the same time, the criminal powers of District Magistrates were enlarged. Subsequently, with the further extension of the criminal powers of the Magistracy, the power of the Subordinate Court, now called Sub-Court, were restricted to civil judicature. 11. In 1860, owing to the increased amount of Division of the P _ Collectorate into Judicial work, the district was divided into two two judicial Divi. rr-i-i \u2022 r\\ r t t sions, and the seat Zillas, each with a principal Court ot J udicature, of the Principal , r, , -i j i j_i j. m i Court of Judicature one at Combaconum, and the other at 1 ranque bar. 0f eac]l.

The Zillah Court at Combaconum, from its first foundation till 1862, remained at that station; in 1863 it was removed to Tanjore.

At present the machinery for the administra tion of Civil justice as constituted under the present \" Civil Courts Act\" (III of 1873), consists of a prin cipal Court of Judicature, under the title of District Court, for each Judicial division with Sub-Courts and Courts of District Munsiffs as shown below : \u2014 South Tanjore. 2 Sub-Courts \u2014 One at Tanjore and one at Combaconum. 7 District Munsiff's Courts at the undermen- tioned stations, to wit : \u2014 (1.)

The machinery for the administration of Criminal Justice is governed by the Code of Pro cedure (Act X of 1872) ; it consists, besides the District Court in its capacity of \" Sessions Court,\" of the various grades of Magistracy with the Collector, in his capacity of District Magistrate, for their head. 14. When the district came under British rule, the Police establishment consisted of a rural Consta bulary, termed Kavalgars,*121 whose origin has never been satisfactorily traced.'13' The Kavalgars of Tan jore were not of the class of Palayagars (Poligars) so well known in the history of the south. They (12). In Tanjore these men are known by the name of Menkavalgars (Overseers of Police) in distinction apparently from village watchers, the Talayars. (13). See Proceedings of the Board of Eevenue, dated 29th August 1856, para. 21. -X"], [480, "446 never, like the latter, assumed the character of Mili- tary Chieftains, or held any lands on feudal tenure ; they had not been officers of revenue or renters of districts. They represented merely a section of those leaders of free-booters, who inhabited the adjoining woody tracts, and were entrusted with the Police service of the country, probably as the most likely to protect it effectually from the depredations of their own class. The ranks of Kavalgars in Tanjore were made up almost wholly of Kallars and Padayaccis, colonists respectively from the south and north, and became largely swollen as these colonies increased after Hyder's invasion in the latter end of the last century. The Kavalgars were, by the conditions of their service, bound to produce all stolen property or to make good its value in money ; but if they ever fulfilled this obligation, the security which the inhabitants enjoyed in this respect was more than counter-balanced by their exactions of blackmail. At first, it seems that, under strict supervision and check, they were useful and efficient guardians of property, but as the native Government grew laxer and weaker, they set its authority at defiance and became themselves robbers. 15. The Commissioners of 1798, in the Appendix to their Report, give a statement of the strength and emoluments of the Kavalgars in the two Sub'has of Tiruvadi and Combaconum, from which it appears, that their number in those two divisions was 182 with 1,744 Peons in their service ; that besides villages of their own of which there were at the time 59, they possessed authorized emoluments, for the support of themselves and their staff of Peons, in the-form of Manyams or assignments of land revenue, amounting in produce annually to 80,873 kalams of paddy, equal in value at the then market selling"], [481, "447 price to Rs. 45,874, in addition to contributions from inhabitants, in both money and grain, amount ing to Rs. 11,789 ; and that in some cases, they were in receipt of pay in money from the Sarkar, (these were generally given only where there were no grants of land-revenue), varying, according to the magni tude of their charge, from 2^ chakrams (about Rs. 4) to as much as 450 chakrams {Rs. 700) annually.*14) Some of the Kavalgar's ranges were restricted each to one village ; but most had wider ranges some extending over from 50 to 70 villages with emoluments rising in proportion. 16. Of the lawless habits of the Kavalgars and the way in which they contrived to elude detection, the Commissioners write (para. 32) as follows : \u2014 They \" are dispersed in every village, and yet act in conjunction. Although some among them possess more wealth and power than others, yet the most formidable have no post of defence or any settled place of residence. They will assemble in the night to effect their purpose and disperse again before morning. It is this circumstance which renders our regular military of little effect. The Cavalcarras watch the troops at their stations, and as soon as a movement, however secret, is made, the alarm is given, and the intelligence flies from village to vil lage with the rapidity of the wind, and by the time the Detachment arrives at its destination, no one is to be found but women and children.\" The follow ing paras, of the Commissioner's report give a full description of the evil effects of the Kavali system of Police : \u2014 \" Para. 26. * * * * But it is not only in Tanjore that the wise and politic institution of District and (14). The amount of Kavalgar's emoluments under this head is not as certainable."], [482, "448 Village watchers is become the scourge and pest of those rich and happy provinces, of which it was formerly the greatest blessing. These watchers or Cavalcarras were originally a warlike race of Peons and in continual use of their pikes and match-locks. As long as the influence of a superior Government was felt and acknowledged through the country, they were found to perform their duties with wonder ful punctuality, and by an unexampled vigilance to secure the inhabitants in general from loss. Owing to these advantages, they have been admitted to the receipt of fees from the cultivators, and to partake of certain but defined privileges in the villages where they are allowed to reside. As the powers of Government relaxed, their misconduct was over looked, and the inhabitants, defenceless and exposed, were unable to keep them within bounds. Being naturally of a predatory habit, they presumed to help themselves with impunity, and to make demands upon that property they were employed to protect. The suffering inhabitants were accustomed to call upon the Circar power to redress their grievances and punish the delinquents, for which purpose the country Princes maintain a military force under the denomination of Sibbendy ; but the same want of energy and ability that loosened the reins of Civil Government, soon pervaded the other department, and the inhabitants found to their sorrow, that no attention was paid to their complaints, and that the Circar had lost the power to enforce the restitution of their property, or to chastise their aggressors.\" \" Para. 27. Under the pressure of these evils, and hopeless of relief, the inhabitants of themselves a cknowledge to us the necessity they were under of compromising with their cruel invaders for their"], [483, "449 safety and ease ; to this compromise we at present owe the apparent tranquillity of the country, while we are well aware, that to this compromise is to be attributed most of the evils Government will have to contend with.\" \" Para. 28. It is no longer to the Circar officer that the inhabitant pays his first tribute of submission, but to the Cavalcarra, and even during the last season in the settlement of the crop, the cultivators not only resisted the claims of the Collector, but combined with the Cavalcarras in open hostility against the armed force that made an ineffectual attempt to subject them to obedience ; and but for timely concessions, they would now have been in a state of insurrection, and the Circar despoiled of its revenue. We also learn from the inhabitants, that such is the arrogance to which they must submit, that they dare not put a plough to the ground without first having obtained the assent of the Cavalcarra ; that if the Meerassdars resist his power, their labourers are made to suffer, and until this tyrant of the village is appeased, no man sleeps secure in his house ; this, we are given to understand, is the greatest evil in the country, and the landholders, as well as the Circar, are equally interested in the reform of it. The mischief has, however, taken deep root, and the present situation of your Collectors demonstrates most forcibly the height to which it is risen, and the insufficiency of their powers to withstand the combination.\" \" Para. 29. The Cavalcarras are very numerous and, from their relationship and connection with the Ario lore and \"Warrior Pollams, are secure in a retreat by only crossing the Colleroon, whenever any measures are taken against them. It is supposed to have contributed greatly to . the Nabob's success in his"], [484, "450 temporary government of Tanjore, his being at the same time in authority over these Pollams, of which the present condition is such as to have the very contrary effect upon us, and it will be in vain for the Company's Government to attempt the suppres sion of these Banditti, until they can, at the same time, cut off their resource and retreat in the Na bob's countries.\" 17. On the assumption of the government by the British, an attempt was made to bring this Constabulary body under control ; the bulk of their authorized emoluments which varied considerably in different villages were reduced (apparently not all, see further on), in the case of ryotwari or un alienated lands, to a uniform percentage allowance on the gross produce, called Kaval Svatantram.*15) The whole of this percentage allowance, with a small tax on houses*16) and certain other contributions termed Purappu and Maghumei*17) was collected by the Revenue authorities and paid to the Kavalgars according to a fixed scale. In the case of Inam or alienated lands, however, they continued to collect their own allowances.*18 The power of the Kaval gars for mischief, however, as also their exactions of blackmail from the inhabitants generally, nevertheless continued, though necessarily in a diminished degree, audit was not until 18 14,*19) when the Kaval system of Police was abolished as part of those measures of judicial reform, which were completed throughout (15). See Chapter IV, Part III, p. 11. (16). This tax seems to have been partially levied from the com mencement of the British rule ; but it does not appear when it was first introduced. See preamble to Eegulation I of 1816. (17). Ibid. (18). Eegulation I of 1816, Section 4. (19). Although the old Police Eegulation was passed only in 1816, the system of Police was introduced, or at any rate the emoluments of the Kaval system were resumed, in 1814.

In the words of Regu lation XI of 1816 of the Madras Code, this estab lishment was \" founded chiefly upon the ancient usages of the country ;\" it consisted of the existing machinery of the Revenue administration, with an additional staff of Peons ; the Tahsildars were made ex-officio heads of Police for their respective taluks, and heads of villages, aided by Karnams and Talayars, officers of Police for their respective villages.*21) The annual cost of the establishment entertained specially for Police duties amounted in 1853-54 to Rs. 68,292.*22) 19. When the Kaval system was abolished, the contributions and allowances till then levied for its support were resumed and declared to be appropriable for the new Police then established.*23) The taxation for the Police was at the same time expressly re stricted to Kaval Svatantram and the house tax ; the contributions of holders of land, wholly or partially alienated, were assimilated to the established rate of Svatantram on unalienated lands ; the house tax then partially levied was extended to all towns and villages and to all descriptions of private buildings (20). Under Eegulation IV to XV of 1816. (21). The heads of villages, however, at that time and for many years after, existed only in theory. The Talayars were hardly ever employed on general Police duties and were eventually given up. Practically, the Karnams were the only village officers on whom devolved any Police duties and these were salaried officers of Government. (See Chapter IV, Part III). (22).

Before the year named, the actual annual receipts on account of the Kaval Svatantram of course varied with the land revenue ; the lowest amount was Rs. 1,18,671 in 1814-15 and the highest amount Rs. 2,35,559 in 1824-25; the average for the ten years preceding 1852-53 wasRs.1,77,857.*25) In 1860, itwas computed at Rs. 2,1 6, OOO*26). Besides this the annual value of grants of land held by Kavalgars, which were resumed in 1814, averaged Rs. 5,000. The house' tax, which averaged Rs. 25,000, *27) was abolished when an Income Tax was introduced for the first time in 1860. 21. The Police establishment introduced in 1814 was superseded by the present Constabulary consti tuted under Madras Act XXIV of 1859 which came into operation in the following year.*28) Its ordinary strength consists of about 1,400 foot Con stables and 26 Inspectors under a European Superin tendent aided by an Assistant, also a European. The departmental control rests with the Inspector-General of Police for the Presidency, while, in matters relat ing to preventive and detective functions, the force (24). The Eegulation provided that if any of the laborers were, on inquiry, found to be able to pay and to be possessed of such a house as might be taxed, they should be liable to the tax (Sec. 5, Clause 2.) It was, however, never levied on the huts of Pallars or other agricultural laborers. (25).

It has been seen from the chapter on the Village establishment, that there is no village Police in Tanjore. In 1877, the actual strength of the force was : \u2014 1 Superintendent. 1 Assistant Superintendent. 20 Inspectors. 6 Sub-Inspectors. 1,403 Constables, of whom 1,032 were employed on general duties, 93 as treasury guards,*29) 182 as guards of Government salt works and stores, 44 as guards at the Land Customs frontier stations and 52 as Jail guards, making a total of 1,403.

This item is not shown in the table appended to para. 13 of the Police Administration Keport ; it has been taken, therefore, from the details of the sanctioned strength as given in table E in Appendix A ; it is difficult to make out how the proportions (columns 34\u201437 of the latter) are calculated. 58"], [488, "454 Operations of the Police, gives Rs. 48-7-1 per square mile, or Rs. 0-1-5 per head of the population. 22. It will be seen that the estimated contribu tion of the landed proprietary for the cost of the Police (Rs. 2,16,000, see p. 20 ante) leaves a surplus of about Rs. 39,000, and adverting to the recent legislation for debiting the cost of the Urban Police to Municipalities, it seems to be deserving of consi deration whether the people of Tanjore, who contri bute so much for the Police,*30) are not fairly entitled to a stronger force than is now maintained. In no country, perhaps, but India, will it be found practicable to carry on Civil Government with a Police force so small relatively to the population, and there can be little doubt, that the degree of protection to person and property, which the country now enjoys, is due more to the peaceable and law abiding character of the great mass of the popula tion than to the adequacy of the Police that is maintained. 23.

The importance of this department in Tan jore as containing the largest irrigated area and presenting the most fully developed system of del taic irrigation, will have been seen from Chapter I of Part III. 27. As already stated, until 1857, the Public Works executive remained with the Collector who carried out all works through the Tahsildars and the Eevenue Establishments generally, subject to the pro fessional supervision of Officers of the Engineer Establishment with whom rested also the preparation of designs and plans for new works. These profes sional duties were carried on by the Superintending, Engineer, whose range extended over the Collector ates of Tanjore and Trichinopoly and part of South Arcot, aided by a Staff of Assistants composed of Engineers and Subordinates ranked as Supervisors Overseers, and Sub-Overseers. Since 1857, the entire Public Works administration has rested with the present Professional department. The organiza tion of this department has since undergone several changes, and as another change is impending at the present moment (1881), any description of the present organization would serve no useful purpose. 28. In Chapter I, Part III, a brief account has been given of the principal hydraulic works con structed since the British acquisition of the province. Roads and bridges, the charge of which likewise rests with the department of Public Works, have been noticed in Chapter X, Part II.

CHAPTER II. ADMINISTRATION OF LAND. RYOTWARI TENURE. Main heads of rp^g tenures of land in their relation to the public Land tenures in their r relation to the public revenue in Tanjore are Ryotwari, Inam, and Zamin- TQ YGHUG . dari. The first means a settlement under which the Government deals directly with each individual ryot or proprietary tenant; under this settlement, the Government receives the full assessment on the land and has the power to vary its demand. Lands under this tenure are^ generally designated Government lands. (!) Inam(2) is the term applied to lands of which the revenue has been alienated wholly or in part, abso lutely or upon certain conditions ; the payment to be made to Government, where the alienation of revenue is partial, being fixed in the shape of a quit-rent. Zamindari means a proprietary estate with fixed tenure and fixed land dues ; the latter being less than the full assessment leviable on Ryotwari lands. Inams of absolute tenure subject to the payment of a fixed quit-rent are much the same as Zamindaris ; the only difference being that Zamindaris are large and Inams small properties and that the latter are charged with a smaller proportion of the full assessment ; in both cases the difference between the full assessment and the fixed Government dues goes to the intermediate holders (Inamdars and Zamin- dars) who collect the full assessment from the ryots (1). In Tanjore the term generally used to signify this tenure is \" Taras \" which is synonymous with the \" Khas Mahal\" of Bengal and Havili of the northern Districts of Madras. (2).

The details of area are not recorded in the Revenue accounts separately for the deltaic and non-deltaic portions of the district ; approximately about two thirds(3) of the Inam, with the whole of the Zamindari area (the latter consisting of thirteen small estates) are situated in the upland or non-deltaic portion of the district. 3.

He, therefore, called upon the landholders for their own accounts of the produce, and appointed one Naro Pandit, an officer of high reputation, well known in Tanjore as Dabir Pandit, who had been employed in the Raja's service during the days of Pratapsing, to form a standard of produce for each village, as the basis of a settlement, towards which an attempt had been made by Raja Tulzaji, and which the Navab was desirous to complete.

It does not appear whether the Navab acted Navab's exactions. to any extent upon the Dabir Muri or not ; nor exactly what Varam or share of the produce he allowed to the land-holders. In a foot-note to the table appended to para. 44 of their report, the Commissioners say: \u2014 \"In the year 1775, we are credibly informed that the whole produce of paddy amounted to 13,300,000 kalams, and owing to the price being 5 fanams (about 12 as. 5 J pies) per kalam, the Navab is said to have collected from the Sirkar share of paddy alone 17,45,625 Star Pago das.\" The amount of produce stated exceeds the Dabir's settlement by 445,000 kalams, and the sum of 17,45,625 Star Pagodas, being equal to Rupees 61,09,687, at the price above-mentioned, gives as the share of the produce taken by the Navab, clear of the usual deductions for village charges, about 7,850,000 kalams, which is about 59 per cent, of the gross produce. W As will be seen in the Political History, according to an account furnished to Colonel Fullarton by an old writer who had been employed in the service of Raja, Pratapsing, the Navab in the second year of his conquest collected no less than Rs. 80,88,888. 8.

From data, however, obtained by this trial, Tulzaji's minister, Raccanna Pandit, Baccannijs increasa raised the Dabir's grain standards in some cases, bringing the aggregate of produce up to 14,789,898 kalams on a cultivated area of 88,550 Velis (578,664 acres), which gave 167 kalams per Veli or 25J per acre. Regarding this total quantity, the Committee (8). See p. 12."], [502, "468 Desolating effects of Hyder's invasion. Pathak Systam, observed (9) \"this is the highest produce which has ever been estimated and which probably the country never yielded.\" It does not appear whether the grain standards thus raised were ever acted upon or not ; but from what follows, it is presumable that they were not, except perhaps in some few instances during the two or three years which in tervened between the abandonment of Amani by Tulzaji and Hyder's invasion, which latter event rendered it necessary to make large reductions in the Dabir Muri itself for a considerable period after it.(10) In the five years after Raja Tulzaji's restoration to power, his total collections from all sources were as follow : \u2014 Rs.

In 1781 occurred the memorable invasion of Hyder, the desolating effects of which will be seen in the Political History.

Part III, Chapter III, p. 22."], [503, "469 ed by Bava Pandit, the able and faithful minister Of Tulzaji. The leading features of this system and the way in which the farms became after wards enlarged and developed into powerful agencies of oppression and exaction, defying, in some instances, even the authority of Government, are described at length in the following paras, of the Commissioner's report : \u2014 \" Para. 13. * * * With a view to encourage a more extensive cultivation, Bauvah united into small Pat hakums a village which had most suffered in the war with another contiguously situated, which had been less exposed, by this means transferring the cattle, implements of husbandry and resources of each to their mutual relief ; a principal land-holder selected by the inhabitants and approved of by the Sirkar was considered as the intermediate agent of both and denominated the Pathakdar, from whom the Sirkar received a Caboleat, binding himself for the cultiva tion of such a portion of land a\u00a3 might be previously agreed on between him and cultivators. With the view of aiding the endeavours of the inhabitants, Bauvah withdrew for a time the usual Sirkar servants, and left to the charge of the head inhabitants the entire management and administration of those villages. This salutary arrangement had the desired effect ; confidence and a spirit of industry revived, and from fifteen the produce was raised to seventy lacks of Cullums. Bauvah was aware of the impolicy of continuing this expedient (which he merely resort ed to from necessity) longer than the impoverished state of the country made it necessary, and it seems to have been his intention to recur to the old system of collection, a village settlement, after four or five years in which time the country would be sufficiently recovered, without there being any well grounded 60"], [504, "470 apprehension that the Pathakdars would acquire a degree of influence any way hostile to the interest of the Sirkar. But Bauvah being soon after displaced, no steps were taken by his successor, Sheverow, for a change of management, and to his want of foresight (by mistaking the temporary expedient of his predecessor for a permanent system) and subse quent corrupt administration, may be justly ascribed tlie present inveteracy of the evil.\" \" 14. In tracing its progress we find that, with a view to relieve himself from the trouble and responsibility then incident to management, he made the system general throughout the country, and by degrees enlarged the Pathakums into little Zamin daris by uniting several villages together and placing over the whole a Pathakdar of his own selection on his presenting him an adequate consider ation, and to these arrangements no objection was made by the inhabitants, since it became the interest of every Pathakdar to court their support previous to offering himself as a candidate and their consent to cultivate previous to his entering into engage ments with the Palace. As the Pathakdars, by the tenor of their Caboleats, were made responsible for a certain defined produce, with the several taxes levied on the inhabitants, in order to obviate any defalcation of revenue ; Sheverow's next imprudent act was to invest them with the authority delegated to the few remaining Sirkar servants employed over the country, most of whom were in consequence dismissed, and their pay divided between the Pathakdars. Thus, by one injudicious step was every gradation of authority annihilated, and the sole power transferred to interested agents between the Sirkar and the inhabitants ; for, although in the pay of rho Palace, the Pathakdars can now be considered"], [505, "471 in no truer light than Renters, making the most favourable terms between Government* and the in habitants for their private advantage without the penalty of forfeit. Thus, it appears that although their office, under certain restrictions, was calculated to the wisest and most beneficial purposes, has been continued beyond the period originally designed, and perverted to the most corrupt ends.\" \" 15. The power of the Pathakdar may be carried to the highest degree of oppression without much fear of detection from the few remaining Sirkar servants in the Soubahs, and of late, as their in fluence has gradually increased, they seem no longer to acknowledge any control ; they possess no sunnuds of appointment, and, although considered removable at the pleasure of the Rajah, that privilege has been but in few instances cautiously exercised from their known connection with the Cavalcarras and the fear of exciting their joint revenge which is shown by plundering the inhabitants and forcing them to disperse if they seem any way disposed to cultivate their lands and conform to the orders of the Sirkar. They now, as if by general combination , levy a fine of from 10 to 15 fanam s on every 100 Cullums on the gross Nan j ah produce, under a pre tence of extra charges, and some of them blend in their own persons the occupation of Pathackdar, Mirasidar and Cavalcarra, all intended to operate as a check on each other. This connection, by ex tending their influence, makes them more formidable than they would be by their number only, which amounts to 225 over the whole country.\" On the demise of a Pathakdar, if the son can make good his father's engagements and is not objected to by the inhabitants, he is considered the Pathakdar and acknowledged as such at the Palace, without any"], [506, "472 other form than passing a fresh caboleat ; but this succession is at the will of the Rajah, and to suit his convenience, without any idea of the office being hereditary.\" \"17. We think it unnecessary to enlarge on the obvious impolicy of this measure to show that Sirkar authority so mutilated was unequal to any of the functions of Government and almost an abrogation of obedience and submission, for, on the minds of a people who for a length of time appear to have been encroaching upon the powers of Government, such an emancipation could not fail to make a deep im pression and to confirm in them those habits of resistance and unanimity, which we now feel our selves called upon to oppose.\" The following is the translation of the Kabulayat or agreement executed by the Pathakdars to the Sirkar or government, which the Commissioners forwarded with their report. \" I do hereby agree for the following 6 villages, viz., five villages in the Maganum of Coodicaul under the Mahall of Saulimungalam, namely : \u2014 on C12 cc 3 o OQ CQ The village of Agra Soonga Taveltan.

(14) It must be here observed, that the standard represented the amount not of the rent payable, but of the gross produce from which the Melvaram or the Government's share was to be deduced by the rates of division in force for the time being, and this has always been the practice in Tanjore, the amount of gross produce being alone specified in all contracts or written engagements for grain rents on nansei lands. The form in which the rents were collected by the Raja's Government will appear further on. 11. The Pathak system never extended beyond ,Th,e *?* \u00b0\\er J \u00ab which the system the delta or the river irrigated area of the province ; extended. and the same Pathakdar had not all the lands of one village always under him. In 1800, the year of the abolition of the system, the number of Pathak dars was 215, and the number of villages included in the rent of one Pathakdar varied from 128 to 1 ; where the Pathakdars had not been introduced, a division of the produce under Amani or a village rent in grain or money prevailed.

This share, always stated at so much per cent., it must be particularly noted, was always calculated, alike under the native and British rule, not on the gross but on the net produce, after deducting the charge for reaping and the cus tomary village perquisites, called Svatantrams and Manyams, established from ancient times/17) of which the rates, however, used to be altered at pleasure by the ruling power. Where, therefore, a percentage is mentiond to denote Varam, it must always be under stood to mean so much per cent, of the produce less these deductions. 13. All that is definitely known in regard to the rate allowed by the early Mahratta rulers is, that it was very low. It has been seen (p. 7) that the Varam allowed by the Navab during his temporary occupation of the country averaged 41 per cent, on the gross produce without the usual deduction of village charges. The Commissioners say : \u2014 \" On Pratapsing' s accession to the musnud (1741), the Malabar^8) cultivators enjoyed 29 kalams in the 100} and the Brahmans 30 in the Pasanam crop and 45 in the Kar, owing to the Kar produce requiring additional labour in watering.\" This statement is repeated by Mr. Wallace in his report, dated 1st May 1805, with the exception that here \" the Sudra Mirasidar's\" Varam is put down as 20 per cent., a clerical error apparently, which is repeated in the Committee's report later on (1807).

(18). \\ This word is used here to denote all non-brahmanical classes of Hindus."], [511, "477 this clerical error, however, there is evidently, as pointed out by the Committee/19) a mistake in the rates given by the Commissioners. In reference to the supposed distinction between Brahmans and Cudras, the Committee point out, that \" the number of Sudra Mirasidars has always been much greater than the number of Brahman Mirasidars ; if the dis tinction had ever existed, there is every reason to believe it would have been continued (this it has not been as will be seen further on) by princes, who are known to have been more disposed to favor than to injure the Brahmans.\" 14. It is generally stated, that Raja. Pratapsing, who ascended the musnud in 1741, and his son Tul zaji successively raised the Varam, and that the lat ter's successor and the last reigning prince, Amar sing, on his accession in 1787, further raised as well as equalised it, allowing exceptionally high rates \" in a few trifling instances of personal favour ;\" and that the increase made by this prince involved a sacrifice of revenue to the extent of 60,000 Star Pagodas. (20> But from the table appended to para. 22 infra, it will be seen that the proportion of the Melvaram (Government's share) to the gross produce in the aggregate, as therein shown, is not less in the years subsequent, than in those antecedent, to the acces sion of Raja Amarsing. The only thing known for certain is, that the rates of Varam which prevailed at the cession of the country to the British, were, with the exceptions just mentioned, uniformly 40 per cent, for the Pasanam and 45 per cent, for the kar.<21) 15.

The Com missioners, who seem to have entertained strange ideas of political economy and good government, pay a compliment to the second and grasping Raja in the following terms : \u2014 \" Shahji, the son and immediate successor to the usurper Rkoji, is said to have held his power complete during a reign of 28 or 30 years, and at this time, the inhabitants were in perfect obedience and paid a very large proportion of the produce to the Sirkar. Sha rabhoji and Tukkoji succeeded their brother Shahji, and benefited by the good order he had established, without appearing to have contributed anything to the power or advantage of the musnud. \"(22> The ideal of good order here unfolded accounts for much of the censure which the Commissioners pass on the undue advantages conceded to the in habitants during the days of the later Rajas and the encroachments which the former were allowed to make on the revenues of the state. On the increase said to have been made to the Varam by Amarsing, which they characterize as a \" profligate remission,\" the Commissioners express their opinion in these terms : \u2014 \" Although the remission has the appearance of justice by equalizing the state of taxation, yet we are forced to consider it in a very opposite sense from the great difference that prevails in the produce of lands contiguous to the rivers and water courses and others within their influence; but while we (22).

The general rates of 45 per cent, for the Kar and 40 per cent, for the Pasanam crop which pre vailed at the date of the British acquisition of the country, however, applied solely to cultivation under river irrigation. In the upland portion of the province, where wet cultivation is carried on under rain-fed tanks, the Varam was always allowed at higher rates, and when the country came under the British Government, it varied from 50 to 60 per cent, of the gross produce. On this subject, the Commissioners observe, \" the increase of tribute^*) that might be raised from this Sub'ha (Pattukk6ttei) has never been attempted by the different princes of the country, from its being the resort of many Poligars and Colleries (Kallars) and adjoining to Tondiman's woods, on which account any innovation would prove hazardous and probably scarcely worth the expense of a reform.\" 17. The following table extracted from the report of the committee^25' affords a clear view of the extent to which Amarsing's higher rates of Varam for Nansei produce or rice prevailed in the year preced ing the British assumption of the country.

The rates of conversion, however, did not rest on mutual agreement between the Government and the Mirasidars, but were forced upon the latter against their wishes. The commutation prices pro fessed to be based on the selling prices of the year ; but they were fixed at a period of the year when the whole produce of the season could not have been disposed of. They were calculated, therefore, partly on actual sales and partly on a forecast of the p'ro bable future state of the market ; further, payment in part was required in advance of the settlements of the commutation prices. On the whole, payments in money were regarded as a grievance, more especially as, owing to the great abundance of the produce and the comparatively small demand for it, its disposal in those days seems to have been a matter of considerable difficulty. The Government in some cases allowed payments in grain as a matter of special indulgence, and the extent to which they were allowed was estimated by the Commissioners at nearly two lakhs of kalams. <26) 19.

The percentage of the Melvaram or the Government's share of the produce is given in round numbers. The amounts of money given in the Commissioners' table in Star Pagodas have been reduced to Rupees at 3\u00a3 for each Pagoda ; the fractions of a Pagoda being rounded. As it is not clear what the gold Fanams at which the prices given in the said table are, and as further they refer to the old Kalam, the prices obtain ed by distributing the amount of paddy revenue over the Melvaram grain reduced to the new Kalam, are entered in Rupees, Annas and Pies. The quantities of grain converted from the old to the new Kalam being necessarily only approximately correct ; it has not been considered worth while to reduce the prioe per Kalam to a fraction of a pie. The prices will not be found therefore to correspond strictly with the quantities of the Melvaram grain and its value.

No change had been made, however, in the existing system of administration ; the revenues being collected from the Pathakdars under engagements they had en tered into with the Raja's Government. In the English possessions on the coast, the \"system adopted was generally that of farming, then in vogue in the other English possessions ; the only exception was that, as the desolating effects of Hyder's war in 1781 had rendered it impossible, for about ten years from that date, to obtain any offers of rent, the Government received its share of the produce in kind under a contract entered into annually with the general body of the Mirasidars/34) At the beginning of 1800, when the remaining three Sub'has were transferred to the British Government, the settlement of one of them, Tiruvadi, had been concluded for the Revenue year then current, i.e., Fasli 1209 (A.D. 1799-800), by the officers of Raja Sarabhdji, and that of the other two, Combaconum and Pattukkottei, was concluded by officers of the British Government under the existing arrange ments.

They had been by no means satisfied, that these measures would secure to the State the full amount of revenue, which Tanjore was capable of yielding ; but they considered it inexpedient to enter into a scrutiny of the actual resources of the country. On this point they expressed their views thus : \u2014 \" To try to develop their reservations by an exposure of the whole produce by the measurement of their lands, under the operation of an Amani management, would probably endanger the peace of the country for a year and, in the opinion of many, sacrifice its revenues ; even then it would be difficult to define the real produce of the nanjah and punjah lands; to ascer- tain the nanjah by measurement would subject us to the necessity of dividing the crops and taking the Sirkar share in kind, and that for a period of years, or the inhabitants would defeat our experi- ment of one or two years by stinting the growth of their paddy, and this is too easily accomplished by only depriving it for a night or two of its usual supply of water. To receive the revenue in kind would also prove a most hazardous undertaking; much would be plundered before it could be dis- posed of, and we fear more would be left, unsold, a burden upon the Sirkar ; for it has been long per ceived by the Princes of Tanjore, that no arrange ment but that of compelling every land-holder to dispose of his portion of the Sirkar grain could possibly relieve the country from the superabund ance of its produce.\" It has been seen that the Commissioners felt much hesitation in recommend ing even the revocation of what they regarded a \" profligate remission,\" i.e., the increase made by Amarsing to the Mirasidar's share of the produce in the Pasanam crop, by which it was raised to 40 per cent, of the gross produce.

The object of the appointment of the Commission was to regulate the subsidy payable by the Raja, by ascertaining the actual resources of the country. On this last point the Commissioners said, that the revenue of Tanjore was so liable to fluctuate with the price of grain, that it was difficult to fix any sum that could be regarded equitable, and recommended that it should be regulated each year by the commutation price settled for that year. 25.

The subject was first brought to Mr. Harris' notice by the Resident at the Court of the Raja, Captain (afterwards General) Blackburn, and the former immediately entered upon a vigorous investigation, removing from office and confining the native officials and offering indemnity and protection to such Mirasidars as should make a full confession of their offences. From the extent, however, to which the peculation seemed to have been carried on, the Government deemed it necessary that it should be made the subject of inquiry by a Special Committee, and appointed one consisting of Mr. Harris, Mr. Wallace, the Collector of the ad joining province of Trichinopoly, and Captain Blackburne. 29. The revelations made by the Committee showed, that the system of fraud embraced the entire area of the district and the main body of native officials, and that it was not confined to the depart ment of receipts, but extended also to that of ex penditure under more or less all heads. The offer of indemnity and protection made by Mr. Harris was availed of by the Mirasidar body nearly to the fullest extent, and from their private ac counts, which they readily produced, and other evidence, documentary and oral, it was ascertained, (10).

In Fasli 1213, Mr. Harris, with the sanction of Government,*60) charged a uniform rate of tax at 2 Star Pagodas or Rs. 7 per Veli, being a little more than a rupee per acre; giving, however, an option to the Mirasidars to divide the produce at rates observed in Faslis 1211 and 1212, where they gave the pre ference to that mode. The money rate here men tioned Mr. Harris intended for one year only, as the plan he was about to submit for the ensuing year rendered it unnecessary for the Government to go into any detail for the assessment of the different descriptions of land.*61) 42. In Fasli 1214, Mr. Wallace dealt with punsei or dry grain lands on the same plan in the main as nansei, that is, he assessed them on an estimate of growing crops, checked by the Amani results of the previous years. The rates of division he adopted in the proportion of two-fifths to Government and three-fifths to the Mirasidars, and the former he commuted for money at the current selling prices of the several grains at the time of the settlement, making such a deduction as seemed necessary to cover any losses which the Mirasidars might sustain from the prices, at that time generally low, falling still lower.

In Fasli 1215, Mr. Wallace had the tidal*64) or high punsei lands classed and assessed at money rates, with reference to the nature of the soil and the produce of former years. (65) On nansei lands, on which a dry grain was temporarily grown, he laid a half of the assessment in money, to which they would have been liable if cultivated with paddy, modifying it, however, in particular cases, \" where, on due inquiry, it appeared that the assessment thus given was too high or too low.\"*66) 45. Fasli 1216 was, as already stated, an ex tremely unfavourable year, and the punsei, like the nansei, produce was in many villages scanty. Mr; Wallace conducted the settlement, therefore, partly on the previous year's assessment and partly on actual produce and price. 46. As regards Svarnadayam or garden lands, as stated in Chap.

For reasons, however, which will be explained here after,*68) this system did not entail any hardship as regarded by far the largest proportion of garden cultivation in Tanjore. It does not appear how Mr. Harris treated crops (other than grains) not included among the thirty-two. Mr. Harris maintained his classification as above mentioned for the first three years, viz., Faslis 1210, 1211 and 1212. In Fasli 1213, with the uniform tax of 2 Star Pagodas per Veli for punsei, he introduced, with the sanction of Government, as a temporary arrangement, a uniform one of 5 Pagodas or Rs. 17^ per Veli or Rs. 2-10-4 per acre for all garden lands, i.e. lands on which any of the thirty -two kinds were cultivated. 47. In Fasli 1214 Mr. Wallace considered that this uniform rate was in many cases too low, and revived therefore, with local variations, the classifi cation of crops with a rate for each class.*69) On this the Board of Revenue communicated the orders of Government as follows*70) : \u2014 \" * * * * I am directed to observe that a system of taxation which augments the assessment on the land, not in proportion to its productive powers, but according to the description of produce raised upon it, affords no encouragement to agricultural speculation; but, on the contrary, its evident tendency is to repress the culture of every other production than those immediately necessary to the subsistence of the population. It is in fact the reverse of a productive principle ; and although (68). See p. 168, further on. (69). Jamabandi Eeport for Fasli 1214, paras. 16, 17, 74 and 76. (70).

If it should be found that any particular production can afford a higher revenue than others to the State, the means will not be wanting to obtain that revenue on the consumption of the article ; but his Lordship in Council is decidedly of opinion, that agricultural industry should not be discouraged by a direct heavy tax upon the land.\" 48. In Fasli 1215, therefore, Mr. Wallace assessed the garden lands upon the principle enun ciated by Government, and maintained the same assessment in the following year. The plan now adopted by him was detailed in his Jamabandi Report thus : \u2014 \" The Baghayat*71) land li2s been assessed not with reference to the articles with which it was actually cultivated, but on a consideration of the different degrees of fertility which it possesses and which it would have shewn under ordinary culti vation with wet or dry grain.

In the first year of the British administration Mr. Harris established a tax per tree on productive fruit trees of each description,*73) and maintained it the following two years. In the fourth year (Fasli 1213), with the sanction of Government,*74) he temporarily exempted tdps and trees from all payment, subject however to such future arrange ments for establishing a fixed assessment on occupied lands generally as might bring those occupied by fruit trees also under taxation. In Fasli 1214, Mr. Wallace reintroduced the tree-tax on Mr. Harris' early plan.*75) On this the Board informed Mr. Wallace*76) that, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, it was open to the same objection as the mode of taxation he had adopted in the case of garden crops, and that it was their desire that Government lands occupied by tops be assessed with a light rent and that single trees and \" sundry trees\" such as Lime, Guava, Orange, Cachu, Jack, and Pumplemoss, should be entirely exempt from (72).

Further on, Mr. Wallace stated that, of the 937 villages which were not brought under the trien nial lease settlement, 785 were situated in the Mayaveram division and had suffered so much for the last four or five years from the failure of the river supply in those branches of the Cauvery on which they were dependent (the cultivation in some having been wholly suspended), that Mr. Wallace considered' it inexpedient to form a triennial settle ment for those villages upon the basis of the actuals of that period ; and that the Mirasidars of the re maining 152 villages obstinately refused to come to any terms.

As will be seen from the quotation above only three villages, formed into one lot were given on a Mootah lease. Mr. Wallace explained the cause of this failure to obtain offers for this form of rent to be that all the principal Mirasidars of the province had engaged for the triennial lease for their own lands, and could not afford the time and atten tion requisite for the management of other lands ; while to persons not experienced in farm manage ment, the speculation, with all the risk which entire dependence on the Mirasidars entailed, held out very little prospect of a profitable venture. 57. On the expiry of the triennial lease, it was resolved that the lease should be renewed for a term of five years. But of the three years of this lease, the first two had not been very favorable as to season and produce, and the third had been disastrous in consequence of a calamitous inundation by which the district was visited. At the same time, owing to the absence of demand from the adjoining provin ces, the prices in the two later years had fallen con siderably, and the Mirasidars had been unable in consequence to seek for compensation for the scanti-"], [553, "519 ness of produce in a ready or advantageous sale of such as they were able to realise. The result was, that they were strongly averse to entering into any engagement for the discharge of the public demand, and more particularly the form of money rents ; the general desire among the Mirasidars was for a return to Amdni as the only system which secured them against all risks from the vicissitudes of season and the contingencies of the market. 58.

They doubted also the actual variability of prices to the extent alleged ; on this point they adverted parti cularly to the reports of the Committee, in which the latter had stated that at no period had there been any considerable exports of grain from Tanjore, that generally the whole produce was consumed within the province and that the demand for it was, there fore, regular and steady. Mr. Wallace, on the other hand, after assuring the Board that the data, \"on which the triennial lease had been formed, were not open to the objections suggested, pointed out that the assumed relation between produce and price was (97).

They had before them three distinct plans in regard to the future village rent settlement, viz., (1) an invariable money demand as it then existed, lowered however to the extent to which the decrease in the average price of grain was calculated to exceed the increase in its average produce ; (2) a money demand varying annually with the price of grain only, and (3) a money demand varying annually with both price and produce. The first was the plan proposed by Mr. Hepburn for Tanjore as already mentioned. The second was what Mr. Wallace had proposed for^. Tanjore in 1810; this was the system termed the \" grain muri\" under which each village was assessed \" with a defined quantity of grain, calculated on the average produce of past years and convertible into money at the current market price in each year.\" The third was what Mr. Lushington proposed for Trichinopoly. 66. The Board had just recently shown a distinct leaning to the second/104) but on this occasion they were decidedly in favor of the first, of the three plans above specified. They said \" to enter into any argument in order to prove the great superiority of a fixed over a variable demand would be to repeat the most trite maxims of established authorities on political economy, and to demonstrate what is already sufficiently obvious. The tax, which a -demand varying with produce or price or with either, must ever impose upon im provement, is so generally admitted as to require no elucidation from the Board, and by the universal conversion, under every system, of a variable into a fixed demand, each successive British Government in India has the best evinced its sense of the great advantage and importance of the latter.\" (104). Board's General Report, 25th January 1819, paras. 523\u2014527 & 531."], [562, "528 67. On this occasion, the Board entered at some . . , length alsointo the question of extending the Ryotwar settlement on a detailed field-assessment to Tanjore. They enter also into the question of a detailed field as- nounce\" againstPIit. Their specific recom mendation. This system, under the strong advocacy of Colonel (afterwards Sir Thomas) Munro, had now found favor with the Home Government ; towards the close of 1817, \"orders had arrived from England for its introduction in all practicable cases, and intimation thereof had been given to the Collectors of all districts which had not been permanently settled. Mr. Hepburn, therefore, in his report just mentioned, brought this question prominently forward, in view to a decision being come to as to whether the village rent settlement was to give place to a Ryotwari settlement or was to be continued for a time longer ; for he considered that the amount of the reduction to be made in the village assessment depended on the form of settlement to be adopted, as the risks of individual responsibility would neces sitate a larger reduction. Mr. Hepburn dwelt at length on the unsuitability of the Ryotwari system to the peculiar circumstances of Tanjore. 68. The Board, as has been seen, had from the first been strongly in favor of village rents ; now, however, they saw no objection to a Ryotwar settlement, where it was practicable, in so far only as each ryot was held responsible for the revenue assessed on his entire farm on the principle of a \" Putent\"(105) or consolidated assessment ; but they were decidedly opposed to a detailed valuation of fields. The following extract contains the most interesting portion of the Board's Proceedings, and (105). Correctly \" Pattukkattu.\" This is a Tamil word, which means a fixed quit-rent and is applied in Tanjore in all private transactions to money rents on Punsei in distinction from grain rents on Nansei which are always variable."], [563, "529 embodies all the arguments adduced by Mr. Hepburn in which they concurred, as well as their specific recommendations with respect to the plan of settle ment to be adopted in Tanjore. \" With regard to the extension to Tanjore, or to the wet lands in Trichinopoly or Tinnevelly, of a field assessment similar to that established by Colonel Munro in the ceded districts ; the Govern ment cannot have overlooked the virtual abandon ment of the field assessments which has taken place in nearly all of the old Ryotwar districts. In Bellary, part of the ceded districts, the over-assessment of the survey in the black lands is stated by the present Collector to have rendered some talooks \" bankrupt,\" and a reduction of 25 per cent, has been proposed by Colonel Munro himself. In Coimbatore and the Northern Division of Arcot, it is proposed to relin quish them for a Putcut or assessment on the entire farm of each Ryot. In Cuddapah and Barramahal, as in Madura and Dindigul, they are undergoing modi fication. In the Southern Division of Arcot they were only partially introduced, and in Nellore their existence was nominal. If, even where they have been the most ably conducted, it has thus been found impossible to continue them, it seems inad visable to incur a heavy additional expense, in order further to extend them, particularly if it should be found practicable to make in most districts a Putcut rent, which will in fact be a Ryotwar settlement without the detail of a rent upon each field. \" It is further to be observed that a field assess ment which taxes the soil itself and varies the amount of assessment with each different description of soil, has a tendency to tax the best soils highly ; to drive the Ryots to the occupation of inferior land ;"], [564, "530 to raise artificially the price of grain ; and to check the natural increase of capital, food and population. That this was its practical result in Madura has been shewn, and there is no doubt that in every other district, similar overassessment has more or less taken place in the nice operation of \" appraising the soil.\" In every district also the inequality of the field assessment has been the theme of representation by the Collectors ; now such over-assessment of the superior soils and such inequalities cannot exist where the tax is a single sum upon a village or farm including every variety and description of soil. \" A reference also to the reports lately submitted by the Board, respecting the experimental Ryotwar survey of a village in several of the districts, will shew how very differently it has been conducted in each ; how exceedingly difficult it will be to establish it on a uniform plan and on correct principles ; and how inapplicable it is to Nunjah, wet or paddy, villages where teerwas have never existed, but par ticularly to those held on Pasungarei tenure. This last point is further illustrated in Mr. Hepburn's present letter. \" There can be no doubt that in Nunjah lands, the produce depends as much upon abundant and certain irrigation as upon the nature of the soil. To make the latter, therefore, as in the Ryotwar survey, the principal standard of assessment, would seem in such lands, to be highly inexpedient, though in Poonjah or dry lands, such as in the ceded districts, this might not have been the case. In the Pasungarei villages likewise, it has been shewn that everything is variable, except the number of shares into which the village was divided on its first establishment and the katleis or large sub-divisions containing"], [565, "531 many fields, into which it is apportioned.\"\" The number of fields in a village varies to the extent of a hundred in each year as suits the convenience of ryots. The ryot who occupied last year fields Nos. 1, 2 and 3, may this year have half of No. 6 and half of No. 7 thrown into one field to cultivate ; or his property in the village, from one of sixty shares, may have been reduced by sale to one-half, one third, or one-sixteenth of a share ; and instead of fields Nos. 1, 2 and 3, he may be the occupant of only a sixteenth part of No. 56 and a thirty-second part of Nos. 80 and 90. Under such a system, it is obviously impossible to establish any assessment upon each field or upon each ryot, without dissolving the unity of interest which pervades the whole and forms the basis of the tenure. \" In these corporate villages a community of stock exists, and in managing their concerns a division of labour amongst the community takes place in con sequence of the unity of interest which prevails through all the Members of it. \" One part of \" the proprietors attend the Tahsildar or Collector \" and conduct the business of the village there ; \" another portion of them are agents with the grain \" merchants and disposing of the produce and for \" that purpose resorting to the seaports and large \" towns; another number is gone to the neighbouring \" districts to supply the wear and tear of cultivating \" cattle ; and the remainder stay at home to manage \" the cultivation and other interior concerns of the \" village. \"(106) To dissolve this unity of interest and common stock of labour by requiring each to take, instead of the share which he possesses, a defined -part of the whole lands of the village, in order that (106). This inner quotation is from Mr. Hepburn's letter."], [566, "532 Government, instead of its present assessment upon the body \"collectively, may assess each ryot accord ing to the soil of the fields composing his portion, would not be very different from dissolving any joint stock company in England and requiring each pro prietor to trade upon his own portion of it, in order that it might be separately taxed. \" The additional labour that would be thrown upon the ryot by having to perform himself the various duties in which he is now assisted by his brethren ; the additional responsibility which he would incur by undertaking alone that risk which he now divides with them, and the increased difficulty he would ex perience in carrying on cultivation upoh his own in dividual stock, instead of upon the joint stock ofthe village, would require that the Government should reduce their demand upon him ; and the reduction necessary for this purpose alone is estimated by the Collector in Tanjore at 5 per cent, upon the land re venue. To lay out annually so large a sum of money in the purchase of what is at best of dubious ad vantage would, in the opinion of the Board, be extremely unwise. \" Under these considerations, the Board are of opinion, that the extension of field assessments to Tanjore or to the wet lands of Tinnevelly and Trichinopoly is no less impracticable than inexpe dient ; and they think that the parties with whom the new settlement ought to be made are the collec tive body of the Mirasidars in each village. The proportion of the total assessment to be paid by each of them, where there is more than one, may be clearly defined by assessing it upon the lands held by each or upon each ryot, and in the Pasungarei"], [567, "533 villages where both are liable to variation, by appor tioning it upon the shares held by each. If there is only one Mirasidar, he will pay the whole ; if more than one, each will pay in proportion to his share. Supposing a Pasungarei village, at the period of its first establishment, to have been divided into 60 shares, of which at present 10 are held by A, 20 by B, 5 by C, 2 by D, half a share by E, five and a half by F, 7 by G, and 10 by H, and the collective assessment on it to be 600 Pagodas, this will give 10 Pagodas to each share ; the sum payable by A, who holds ten shares, will be 100 Pagodas ; by B who holds 20, 200 ; by C 50 ; by D 20 ; by E 5 ; by F 55 ; by G 70 ; and by H 100. Again, if H were to sell four of his shares to a new ryot K, he will trans fer with it a proportion of the assessment ; H in this case would pay 60 Pagodas only and K the re maining 40. These would be the portions of the collective assessment payable by each individual ; but the whole would be responsible for any deficiency.

The remission to be thus granted will vary in different villages ; for instance, if the market price is estimated at 35 per cent, below the Jumma bundy price, the remission will be 25 per cent. ; if at 30 per cent., it will be 20 per cent.; if at 25 per cent., it will be 15 per cent, and so on. It is obvious that, unless the remission is regulated upon this principle, all offers for a money rent will be rejected, and as a further inducement to Mirasidars to consent to en gagements in money, they might be informed that, if the price of grain should fall still lower and average less than the estimate upon which the remission was calculated, a proportionate further remission will be made to them ; but that if grain should rise in price, no extra demand would be made on them on that account. The Mirasidars would thus be freed from the possibility of loss, but might derive a profit which is an encouragement, it may be expedient under their late losses, to holdout to them.\" The Government accorded their sanction to this suggestion/110) 72. It is somewhat difficult to conceive what difference this suggestion made, so far as the varia bility of the demand was concerned, beyond con ceding to the Mirasidars the benefit of an increase in the actual above the estimated market price, while a remission for a decrease was guaranteed to them. The difference in the aggregate between Mr. Hep burn's proposal which was first sanctioned and the plan eventually authorised was so much as consti tuted the difference between an eleven per cent, remission and a remission equal to the whole excess of the commutation price of the last settlement over the current selling price less 10 per cent, taken out of the Kudivaram.

On the one hand, the Governor in Council does not wish them to be bound for a longer term than is agreeable to them selves, and, in that view of it, the settlement is only formed for the year. On the other hand, the Governor in Council has no intention of altering the settlement as long as it continues adequate and equitable. To meet, however, the contingency of future fluctuations in the price of grain to the same extent as the fall which has made the reduction of the assessment necessary, it may be useful to specify before hand the way in which the Governor in Council has thought fit to resolve that future settle ments shall be affected by them. You will accord ingly instruct the Principal Collector to make known, that a further reduction will be allowed if the price of grain shall fall five per cent, below its present price, and that no increase shall take place unless it rises ten per cent.

But the Board made another sugges tion : \" The produce of a village in Tanjore,\" they said, \" is affected only by the variableness of the seasons and the timely influx of the waters. The universal cultivation of the Province excludes one material cause of fluctuation which operates in other districts \u2014 that of the more or less quantity of land brought under the plough. Referring to this circumstance, the Board are of opinion that it would be a most advisable measure to fix a certain quantity to be taken as the standard produce of each village and to determine the assessment by the commutation of that quantity into its value at the price of grain at the time of settlement. \" They are not aware of any objection to this system which would render the application of the principle of reduction and augmentation laid down by the Government, both easy and certain. \"(116) 78. It has been seen how strong the Board were, just fifteen months before, against a demand variable with price. The reasons which had led them to change their views are thus explained in the letter/117) with which they submitted to Government the rules framed by Mr. Cotton for fixing a standard of produce for each village as will be seen further on: \u2014 \" When the adoption of this plan was formerly in contemplation, it was deemed to be liable to the following objections : \u2014 \" 1st. \u2014 Although the quantity of produce should be fixed, there would still remain the very nice and (116).

On proceeding, however, to the formation of the settlement for Fasli 1230, it was found inpracticable to effect it on the above principle, in consequence of the great fluctuations which had taken place in the price of grain and which still continued. It became therefore absolutely neces sary, in concluding the settlement for that year, to have recourse to inquiries and calculations which involved both price and produce ; but the present Collector had, previously to the adoption of this mode of settlement, distinctly stated that the oper ation of determining the price at which the Govern ment share was to be valued would be attended with no difficulty whatever. \" It may here be observed that, so long as there is any great fluctuation in the price of grain, it will, in a country like Tanjore where there is so much rice cultivation, be impossible to make an assessment, which shall not vary and be also fair both to the Government and the people.

With this view, therefore, the Board made to the Principal Collector the communication alluded to in the 1st para of this letter.\" 79.

A money standard was then fixed/121) This, however, did not result directly from the grain standard, but was deduced, by a process of comparison and adjustment, from other data. The processes by which the two standards were fixed will be described in their order. 80. In fixing a grain standard, it was intended thf odrea;nbysta^rd to bring to account the increase in the rate of produce was fixed which, it was considered, had taken place from the improved means of irrigation ; but during the rent settlements which had prevailed since Fasli 1213, it had not been the custom to require any accounts of the produce, and excepting, therefore, the comparatively few cases in which the revenue had been collected under Amani, none that could be depended upon were forthcoming. Mr. Cotton, therefore, had recourse to the older accounts, in order to determine the ad dition to the standard of produce that might be made in each village. He took for his data : \u2014 (1). \" The present Jamabandi grain amount. \"<122) (2). The average of the two highest of the four Amani years (Faslis 1210\u20141213). (3). Do. less 10 per cent. (4). Dabir Muri (see p. 6 ante). (121). From Mr. Cotton to Board, 21st December 1822. (122.) It is not quite clear what this exactly represents. In an old Mahratta paper, it is mentioned as the Jamabundi grain amount of Fasli 1229 ; but this was a year of lease settlement based on the money average of the early years (Faslis 1210 to 1216, p. 53). Presumably, it is the average of tho produce, actual and assumed, from which resulted the money settlement of those years. 69"], [576, "542 On a comparison of these with one another, Mr. Cotton, by the method explained and illustrated in the rules which he framed for the purpose/m) adopted one of them as the standard. The rules are transcribed below : \u2014 \" 1st. \u2014 If the present Jamabandi grain amount is greater than either the average produce (of the highest two of the four Amani years) deducting 1 0 per cent, or the Mooree, the present Jamabandi grain amount is to be confirmed, as the standard grain amount. \" Example as follows: \u2014 (124) \" 2nd. \u2014 If the present Jamabandi grain amount is less than the Mooree, but greater than the average produce, without any deduction, the present Jama bandi grain amount is to be fixed as the standard grain amount. (123). Enclosure A to Mr. Cotton's letter to Board, dated 8th December 1821. (124). There is apparently some mistake in this illustration. The Jama bandi grain amount is greater than even the average without the 10 per cent. deduction ; but the rule contemplates a case where it is less than this. Very probably, the second figure (1411) is a clerical error for 1431 or some other higher than the first (1428). The impression in Tanjore is that the principle was to take the second highest sum, and that it was so, is infer able from the rules all taken together.

The fact that the Olungu commutation price for each Maghanam was thus fixed does not appear in the correspondence with the Board and Government, relating to the Olungu settlement.

(3). \"Where the excess was more than 20 per cent., one-half was added. (4).

In his report on the introduction of the triennial lease which terminated with Fasli 1219, Mr. \"Wallace stated that, in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee, approved by Government, top lands were rated at one-third of the estimated produce (presumably gross) of the trees. Probably the tree-tax, according to Mr. Harris' original scale, was considered to represent this proportion of the produce and was therefore then retained. In point of fact, however, it is considerably below one third of the gross produce of the trees ; at least such is the case now. At the same time^it is^hardly'to be expected that the remaining two-thirds after deducting the cost of labour which would have to be spent on the rearing of such fruit trees as cocoanut, mango and jack, would leave any profit to the land holder. 89.

In fact, it was the Jamabandi of Fasli 1229 that was made the basis of the Olungu settlement. This year was the last of a series of lease settlements, of which the triennial lease of Faslis 1217-1219 was the foundation. This triennial lease was form ed upon the money average of the previous th\\ee years (Faslis 1214-1216) modified by the similar average of the four Amani years, 1210-1213. <137) These averages, so far as produce was concerned, must have been exceptionally low, as three of the seven years embraced therein, viz., 1212, 1214 and 1216, more particularly the last two, were extremely unfavourable. Moreover, the amount of the trien nial lease had undergone a diminution at its renewal for five years from Fasli 1220 to 1244.(138) But in those seven years, prices had contributed largely to enhance the revenue demand. If a money demand, calculated by the application of a higher commutation price to a certain amount of grain, is re-converted into grain by a lower commutation price, the result ing grain amount must become increased, and this in a measure is what took place. Say, for example, the present money demand on a village is obtained thus : \u2014 Kalams. Gross produce 5,000 Melvaram at 40 per cent 2,000 Rs. Its value at 8 as. per Kalam 1,000 Melvaram calculated from the sum of Rs. 1,000 at 5 as. per Kalam 3,200 This, taken as 50 per cent, would give a gross produce of 6,400 Increase 1,400 (137).

An increase to this extent, counterbalanced by the increased rate of Melvaram adopted at the Olungu settlement (this however was a comparatively insig nificant factor), may be taken, if there had been no disturbing elements, to be the proportion in which the grain standards were raised above those which formed the basis of the money amount of the Jamabandi for Fasli 1229. But as already stated, that money amount underwent other modifications both before and at the Olungu settlement. Further,"], [587, "553 the lease settlement, to which the Jamabandi of Fasli 1229 is traceable, was not based exactly on the average revenue of the seven years, from Fasli 1210 to 1216; it was based on the average of the last three, modified severally and individually by the results of the first four of those years. Again, in the case of Amani villages, (there were 371 villages under this mode of settlement in that year), the reve nue for Fasli 1229 was based on the actual selling price, which in that year was very low, i.e., 6 annas 10-JHJ- pies. On the whole, from the complicated nature of the data, it is extremely difficult to say in what proportion each modificatory element tended to enhance or reduce the Olungu grain standards. In the aggregate, these gave an increase of about 9 per cent, on the grain equivalent of the money de mand for Fasli 1229, above referred to as \"present Jamabandi grain amount,\" (see para. 80 ante) thus : \u2014 Kalams. Present Jamabandi grain amount 12,350,707 Olungu grain standards 13,408,892 Increase 1,058,185 (139) 92. On the complicated and roundabout process, bywhich the above resuItwascometo,Mr. Kindersley, in his letter to the Board of Revenue, dated 20th June 1828, (para. 16), wrote as follows : \u2014 \" The arrange ment they (the Mirasidars) complain of was the following. Instead of starting from the grain amount, Mr. Cotton took the money amount of high price years as his foundation ; he then calculated the grain amount which, at the low prices then current, would make up a beriz equal to the former money b\u00a3riz ; (139). These figures have been taken from statement No. 9 submitted with Mr. Cotton's Jamabandi report for Fasli 1234. They include 4,621 out of a total number of 4,724 villages, and it does not appear why the remaining 103 villages were excluded."], [588, "554 and this he established as the grain beriz of the village ; convinced from general investigation that the former beriz was much too low and ought to be raised, but from want of accounts reduced to this expedient to obtain his object.\" 93. As already stated, it was the Olungu com mutation price, not the Jamabandi price of Fasli 1229, which became the standard for comparison with the actual selling price (see following para.) . Say, for instance, the Jamabandi commutation price of Fasli 1229 was 10 annas, the Olungu price 1\\ annas, and the actual selling price 9 annas per Kalam, the last being 20 per cent, over the Olungu price ; leaving out 10 per cent, of the increase, the remain ing 10 per cent, was added under the terms of the Olungu settlement to the Government demand for the year, notwithstanding that the actual selling price Wets still 10 per cent, less than the Jamabandi commutation price of Fasli 1229. On the other hand, say the actual selling price was 7\\ annas per Kalam ; there was to be no remission, because the decrease below the Olungu commutation price was less than 5 per cent., notwithstanding that it was 27^ per cent, less than the Jamabandi commutation price of 1229.

The precise mode in which, under the Olungu to price under the system, the demand was adjusted annually with re trateoT \"^ em ' us' ference to price, is illustrated by imaginary figures in the two tables annexed below, which are transcripts of those forwarded by Mr. Cotton to the Board with his letter, dated 21st December 1822.

The averages were struck from actual sales in villages belonging to each Maghanam ; for Kar from 1st November to 31st January, and for Pasanam from 1st February to 20th May. The village sales were returned by the Kar nam every five days, and from them the Tahsildar compiled a return every ten days and transmitted it to the Collector's Office, where the averages were struck.

On the nature of the Price returns and the character of the agency by which the sales were registered, Mr. Phillips in his report above quoted wrote as follows : \u2014 \" It will be perceived from the foregoing details that the village sales only, and consequently the prices at which the Mirasidars actually sell their grain, are taken into account ; the town prices, which of course include the cost of carriage and the mer chant's profit being entirely excluded excepting in two instances in which, unfairly as I think, the town prices enter into the calculation. \" The agency employed in originally registering the sales, viz., the Village Curnums, is not very trust worthy, and the system, moreover, under which the prices are obtained, is open to fraud, to say nothing of the vexatious interference which it involves ; but they are taken in so many different places, that any extensive combination to return false accounts is not possible. \" But the system, as has often been before pointed out, is very unfavourable to the Mirasidars in one respect. In practice, the Price returns comprise almost entirely the retail sales only and exclude wholesale purchases ; consequently, the prices re turned are in reality higher than those which the Mirasidars, the most important of them at least, obtain for the grain.\" 97.

It was the depression of the grain market, satisfaction at the which constituted the grievance of the Mirasidars, ton-^Vungu^ettie- that led to a revision of the terms of the previous ment* lease settlement, and a revised settlement, therefore, the financial result of which was a decrease far below what it would have been in proportion to the fall in the price of grain, and which, by fixing an increased standard of produce with a reduced com- mutation price, provided by its elastic rules for an augmentation of the revenue as the state of the market improved, cannot but have been satisfactory. Accordingly, the Board of Revenue and Government expressed much satisfaction at the result. Of the rules, under which the grain standard for each village was settled, the Government said, they \" seem equitable and judicious. \"(U1> The Board indeed at first considered the standards to be inadequate ; they said : \u2014 \" As there seems to be no doubt that the pro- duce has considerably increased of late years, under the great improvements effected at much expense by the Government in the irrigation of the country, particularly in the eastern taluks, and as the demand for grain has also increased, it seems proper that the Principal Collector should, by further inquiry and by a reference to every source of information within his reach, endeavour to asertain the actual produce, and whether it might not be estimated at even a higher scale than the rules now submitted provide for.\" The Board did not suggest this \" as a measure to be adopted hastily or without sufficient grounds, but as being worthy of the best consideration in carrying into effect an arrangement which is intend- (140).

From the first it was the impression of the character of per- Board of Revenue and Government, that the settle- theDeioiunguC grain ment, so far as the grain standard for each village Etan ards' was concerned, was to be unalterable. The Govern- ment in their letter to- the Board of Revenue, dated 11th January 1822, said (para. 8) \" the standard produce of each village will be ascertained under the proposed rules and permanently adopted.\" With reference to the desire for a fixed money demand expressed by the Mirasidars to Mr. Cotton in the course of his introducing the Olungu settlement ; the Government, as already stated, intimated that the settlement was \" not liable to be altered unless under some general change of circumstances which would make an alteration both necessary and equit able,\" and that such a tenure was \" more for their interests than any lease for a term of years could be.\" On a suggestion as to the desirability of fixing a money assessment, made by the Board in their review of the Jamabandi Report for Fasli 1232 the Secretary to Government, in his letter dated 30th December 1823, communicated the latter's senti ments (para. 6) as follows : \u2014 \" With respect to what is stated by you regarding"], [604, "570 the important object of fixing a tirva in money on the different descriptions of land ; I am directed to observe that, in as far as that mode of assessment may differ from the mode which has been pursued under the sanction of Government, granted on your recommendation on the 3rd of March 1820, and mo dified on the 10th of January 1821 ; it is essentially necessary to preserve the faith of Government unim paired. The fixed tirva in money, by whatever pro cess it may be determined, 'cannot be made higher than the standard produce converted into money at the selling price, on the conditions annexed to the present system. The present system may itself, in a course of years, grow into a fixed tirva in money, by a mutual agreement between the Government and the Mirasidars to relinquish the contingent advantage of a fluctuation of price ; but it cannot, compatibly either with justice or with subsisting engagements, be superseded by a tirva fixed upon different princi ples and producing a result less favourable to the in terests of the Mirasidars. \" a clause inserted m. In the Pattas, however, which he granted in Pattas as to the ... , . standard being liable to the Mirasidars On the introduction Of the Settle certain circumstan- ment, Mr. Cotton inserted a clause, \" stipulating that the rent shall hold good provided it did not appear that it was formed on any false accounts, and that the villages were capable of yielding a greater excess of produce above the assumed grain amount than 20 per cent., which,\" he said in a subsequent report, \" to cover the effects of unfavorable seasons, when no extraordinary inundation or drought gave a title to remission, and to encourage industry and attention in the cultivation, I deemed a sufficient and just allow- Proceedings taken ance.\" Acting on this clause, Mr. Cotton, in Fasli authorities thereon. 1233, called for lists of villages which were deemed"], [605, "571 to be capable of yielding more than the fixed standard of produce ; 164 villages were returned to be so, but he took no action thereon in that year; in the following year (Fasli 1234) he directed a further examination and the returns received showed that in 384 villages the actual yield ex ceeded the standard by more than 20 per cent. Mr. Cotton then issued orders to the Tahsildars to stay the reaping and to require the Mirasidars to give their assent to the excess over 20 per cent. being added to the standard. The Mirasidars of 345 villages gave their assent, and an increase was made to the grain standards of 68,349 Kalams, on which the assessment, at the standard commutation price, was Rs. I4,692,and, inclusive of the demand for increase of price, which this year was very high, Rs. 25,670. The Mirasidars of the remaining 39 vil lages having demurred to the demand, the Sirkar share of the excess thereon was \" secured;\" the excess real ized in these last mentioned cases was Rs. 9,739. 112. It appears, that it was the Sub-Collector, Mr. A. Sinclair, that showed the greatest vigour in these proceedings. Of the 345 villages, in which the Mirasidars assented to the increased demand, 230 were in his division ; but he was not satisfied with the result of the scrutiny, where a greater excess than 20 per cent, was not discovered ; in all such cases he apparently contemplated a repeti tion of the scrutiny every year. Mr. Cotton entrusted the work to the regular officers of the district ; but the Sub-Collector employed the agency of \" tempo rary Amins,*169) who were prompted to vigor by the hope of obtaining permanent appointments in the event of their being successful in realizing what (169.)

These proceedings Mr. Cotton communi cated to the Board in his Jamabandi Report for Fasli 1234,*171> and that authority passed strong animad versions thereon.*172) \" The object of the Government,\" they said (para. 9), \" was decidedly to attach an idea of permanency to the grain standard, which was to be ascertained on the best information attainable at the time, and thenceforward to remain generally unaltered^\" After quoting at length the passages from the orders of Government recited in para. 110, they observed : \u2014 \" The Board will not question the justice of su perseding that standard in cases where it may be discovered that gross fraud was practised at the time of settlement for the purpose of concealing the resources of particular villages, in consequence whereof the standard was fixed lower than it ought to have been. But it has always been their under standing, that the standard being considered to be for the most part adequate,*173) was to be maintained permanently as the limit of the Government demand in respect to the produce of the land, \" unless under some general change of circumstances which would render an alteration bofc_mecessary and equitable.\" Indeed, the only apprehension on the part of Govern ment appears to have been, that the standard was (170).

Note as entered in the margin of the Board's Proceedings : \u2014 This is stated by the Principal Collector himself in the report under review. \" I have no reason,\" he says, \" to think otherwise than that it embraces a fair average produce which should form the basis of the settle- ment.\""], [607, "573 not sufficiently moderate, and the only provision which is made for a change is in the case of its being found too high.\" \" From these considerations, the Board cannot but think that the Principal Collector contravened the intentions of Government when he made the per manency of the grain rent conditional in his cowles. There appears to the Board to be nothing in any of the orders of Government regarding the settlement, which can be construed to warrant the insertion in the cowles of a clause stipulating that the rent should hold good provided it did not appear that the villages were capable of yielding a greater excess above the assumed grain amount than 20 per cent. The con dition of its not being formed on false accounts was perhaps properly inserted, as it must be understood to exist whether expressed or not. But the other condition 'seems to be in direct opposition to the ob ject of the settlement, and gives it a totally different character.\" \" The settlement authorized by Government is fixed with respect to the produce, and fluctuates only under certain known and defined circumstances, in its money valuation ; but the settlement according to the Principal Collector's cowles varies both with the price of the produce and its quantity, that is to say, there is a standard of quantity below which it is not to fall, but there is no limit to its augmentation where the produce has increased beyond a certain extent above that standard.\" The Board concluded by expressing their entire disapproval of the proceedings of the Principal and Sub-Collector, and by recommending to Government, that \"they be wholly reversed, and that it be declared that no alteration shall be made in the standard grain 73"], [608, "574 Decision of Govern' ment. rent except on proof of gross fraud having been practised in the formation of the settlement, and with the sanction of Government.\" 114. On this, the Secretary to Government in his letter dated 21st February 1826, conveyed the following observations to the Board : \u2014 \" * * * the Principal Collector certainly departed from the principles which the Government had sanc- tioned for the settlement of the province. Even if the circumstances which he has represented rendered this measure expedient, it was improper in him to adopt it without your knowledge and approbation. Your remarks generally upon this subject are very proper, and strictly applicable to the kind of settle- ment which had been directed to be introduced, and which there was until lately every reason to consider as actually prevailing in Tanjore. The object and intention of Government in the orders to which you refer is correctly stated in the 9th paragraph of your proceedings. But the extent to which the faith of Government was pledged to the people is obviously limited to the degree in which that intention was carried into effect by the engagements actually en- tered into with them by the Principal Collector. When Government regarded its faith as pledged to adhere to the principles of assessment which had receiv- ed its sanction, those principles were understood to have been mutually agreed to by the officers of Govern ment on the one side and the Mirasidars on the other. This now appears not to be the case, and as the pro ceedings of the Principal and Subordinate Collector in taking advantage of the stipulation above referred to, were agreeable to the conditions of the subsisting engagements, they do not seem to have afforded the Mirasidars any ground to complain of injustice."], [609, "575 This conclusion is strengthened by observing that where the Mirasidars objected to the increased demand, they appear to have done so merely by dis puting the fact of an excess of produce to the extent which would entitle Government to benefit from it. But although the reversal of those proceedings is not required by justice, yet in order strongly to mark and to impress on the minds of the people the dis position and intention of Government to establish and to adhere to an assessment liable to fluctuation in no greater degree than may be unavoidable ; the Governor in Council deems it proper to direct, that, excepting where it is fully ascertained either that the determination of the standard produce was affected by fraud, or that an additional extent of land has been since brought under cultivation, or that in consequence of improved means of irrigation, provided at the expense of Government, two crops are obtained in the year from land which before yielded only one, the collections which have been levied on account of excess in the actual over the standard produce be returned.\" 115.

From the fact, therefore, of the whole amount of the extra collections having been thus refunded, it seems to be presumable that none of the conditions enumerated in the foregoing quotation from the order of Government as necessary to justifythe extra collections levied existed in fact. 116.

With respect to villages, whose resources were not fully developed at the time of the settlement, and in which the inhabitants, by the aid of the works constructed at the public ex pense for the purpose of irrigation, have been enabled to bring lands which were then waste under cultiva tion ; the Board are inclined to think that, according to the general principles of revenue administration now acted upon throughout the country, the Govern ment have a right to raise their demand from the cultivators in proportion to the increased produc tiveness of the whole lands of the villages in conse quence of the extension of cultivation.\" Directions of Go- 117 Qn the procedure to be adopted for the vernment as to the r r procedure to be future, the Government communicated their direc adopted for the future.

Such inquiries ought certainly to be made, as much as may be con sistent with the effectual accomplish ment of their object, through the public servants ; and although it is frequently necessary to seek for in formation from other quarters, and it would appear that the scrutiny was not exclusively committed to the Ameens employed by Mr. Sinclair, yet his having employed them with out the sanction of higher authority is considered objectionable. But although it is deemed expedient that the inquiries which have been begun by the Principal Collector and the Sub-Collector into the actual resources of the country should be prosecuted ; it is the wish of the Governor in Council that the stand- ard produce, as specified in the Pattahs, should, excepting where clear proof of fraud or of one of the other grounds of exception already"], [612, "578 stated has been obtained, be adhered to in the settlement for the current Fusly and until full information respecting the result of those inqui ries has been furnished to your Board and to the Government. At the same time, it is suggested for your con sideration whether the settlement before directed to be introduced might not hereafter, with advantage, be so modified, that the amount of stand ard produce regulating the public demand should vary with the varying extent of the land under actual cul tivation. In considering this point, it will be necessary to advert to the mode in which the specific land or the limited extent of land to which any particular amount of standard produce has reference is or, with faci lity can be, defined, and to the means which the Revenue officers possess of ascertaining annually the extent to which cultivation is actually car ried.\" pu^d *o^n_* Il8> The incllliries> however, the prosecution The system of 0f which was sanctioned bv Government were not bringing extra culti- \" vation to account pursued any further ; but the course suggested in operation. the last quoted para, of the order of Government became henceforward the rule of the Olungu settle ment. There was a measurement account, from which the extent of cultivation to which the grain standard fixed for each village had reference, was ascertain able, and this was adopted as the standard area beyond which all cultivation was taxable. But the measurement was rough and the boundaries ot the"], [613, "579 Olungu area had not been clearly defined. Until, \u2022therefore, a settlement based on a regular survey was introduced later on, the question whether or not the produce of a particular plot of land was included in the standard grain amount continued to be the sub ject of contest between the Mirasidars and the Revenue officers ; much, of course, depended on the Karnams. During the whole period which interven ed between the Olungu and the survey assessments, a considerable increase was nevertheless made to the Olungu assessment on account of cultivation assum ed to be in excess of the Olungu area; but a portion of the increase thus made continued to be a perpetual subject of dispute. The less obstinate of the Mirasi- dars generally gave in ; but in many cases the extra demand stood over for years, and was eventually written off under the head of irrecoverable arrears. The extra cultivation was assessed of course at the village average, i.e., the average obtained by distri buting the amount of Olungu assessment over the assumed Olungu area. 119. One essential feature of the Olungu system No remission for . -iii \\&ii<\u00b1 relinquished or was, that, while all extra cultivation was added to second crop not cui the Jamabandi, no deduction was made on account of land relinquished or left waste by reason of its having become unproductive, and thus every acre added to the Olungu area became permanently incor porated with it. The same rule was observed with respect to a second crop grown on land classed as one crop land; a charge once made being never afterwards remitted even though no second crop was grown. 120. The operation of these rules constituted a. Recent rule of de- r _ ducting half assess grievance, of which the Mirasidars continued to ment \u00b0n Jaud given D .up and charging complain loudly ; for, while there was a progressive three-fourths on land taken up."], [614, "580 addition to the demand on them ; on the principle which governed remissions under the Olungu settle ment, as will be shown presently, there was no remission of revenue except when the actual produce of the entire holding fell short of 70 per cent, of the standard. There was indeed an objection to land left waste being struck out; the fields not having been assessed in detail, the remission of assessment would have had to be made at the general average rate on the same principle on which extra cultiva tion was assessed, and as lands given up must have been necessarily inferior, a remission of assessment at the general average rate would have involved a sacrifice out of proportion to the actual value of the land. On this anomalous feature of the Olungu sys tembeingbroughtto theirnotice ata recent period, the Government laid down the rule, that on all land given up half the assessment at the village average be remitted, and that on all those newly taken up three fourths of the average rate be charged.*176) This rule is accordingly now in force in those parts of the district, where a lump assessment on the village prevails. As to the difference between the rates prescribed for the two cases, the Board observed, \"there is a valid distinction as to the probable value of land given up as being unfit for cultivation and land taken up as (it may be assumed) fit for cultiva- tion.\"*177-) The Government at the same time accorded sanction for lands, which had been saddled with second crop assessment but had ceased to yield a second crop, being relieved from such impost, and for its being charged in future only when a second crop was actually raised.

Another anomalous feature of the Olungu Assessment on . ., . Garden lands. system was the mode in which garden cultivation was dealt with. In 1807, it has been seen, an assessment was established for each village on an average of Mr. Harris' original rates on such of the different crops classed by him as garden as happen ed to have been cultivated in the three previous years.(178) At the Olungu settlement, this assess ment was confirmed, and when the area of cultiva tion under each description of cultivation was after wards fixed, and the rule was introduced of charging all extension of cultivation at the village average, land once cultivated with any of the garden crops was added to the garden area and became permanent ly subject to the average garden rate, whether it was ever afterwards cultivated with any of these crops or not. As already stated, the assessment under this head had no reference to the fact of its being irrigated under wells or otherwise or not at all; it depended solely on the description of the crops. As a necessary sequence of taxing according to the description of the produce, dry crops irrigated were treated as punsei. As already stated*179) of tho thirty-two kinds originally classed by Mr. Harris as garden crops, Cotton, Indigo, Senal (Crotolaria juncia) and Tobacco had, ha 1807, been classed as punsei and assessed at dry rate. Subsequently (it does not appear when) these four kinds were re-transferred to the head of garden.*180) 122.

The actual yield of the entire holding was made the test of a just claim to relief, and it was only when it fell short of 70 per cent, of the standard, that relief was Adjustment of de- granted.

Board's Proceedings 10th August 1854 and 2nd July 1859."], [617, "583 it was only when the aggregate was less than 70 per cent, of the standard that the Pasanam crop was admitted under Varalachedam. When it was ad mitted, the division of the crop was made upon the aggregate made up of the actual out-turn of the Pasanam and the probable out-turn of the Kar crop, and the value of the Government share at the current selling price collected from the Mirasidars. It will be thus seen that, except in one particular, viz., the mode in which the Kadappukar cultivation was dealt with, the system of division of produce was precisely the same as under Amani. 124. The percentage limit which regulated the Tne plan virtual- \u25a0 ., . . ly sanctioned by the grant of relief, as likewise the particular mode of Board of Revenue dealing with the Kar cultivation, does not appear to have been fixed upon with the previous sanction of Government or the Board of Revenue; but the pro cedure was noticed in annual reports year by year and approved. 125. In the preceding pages are given all such observations on ,. -iii- n i a i /-vi \u2022 discoveries of excess data as are available m regard to the Ulungu gram over the standard standards, from which perhaps an opinion may be i234U\u00b0e '\" as ' formed as to how far they can be regarded as repre- senting a fair average of the productive capacity of each village; but it may not be out of place here to notice facts which might help in forming an opinion as to the real significance of the discoveries made in Fasli 1234. Out of a total number of 4,098 villages, it was only in 384 that an excess over 20 per cent. was found; it does not appear what was the actual number of villages in which there wa^ any excess. In the very same year, 913 villages had suffered so severely from drought in the early part, and inunda tion towards the close, of the season, that a settle ment on actual produce became necessary, and the"], [618, "584 A Survey Field assessment resolved upon in 1827. actual produce of these villages was about 52 per cent, of the standard.*183) In the very first year of the Olungu settlement, out of 4,723 Govern ment villages, 685 remained under Amani, because the Mirasidars objected to the grain standards as too high; and although some of these were subsequently brought under settlement on reduced standards; yet for a considerable period afterwards, there were each year a number of villages for the same reason under Amani. Indeed, until Fasli 1269, when a money demand established throughout the district, with prices ranging at about double the commutation price, reduced the land assessment to about a half of what it used to be; a large number of villages was brought annually under \" Varalachedam\" harvest for short produce. On the whole, considering how liable to variation the nansei produce, from its entire dependence on a regular supply of water at each stage of its growth is, and how much it varies in the same season in different parts of the delta from a derangement of the normal conditions of the various channels of distribution; itis obviously unsafe to draw a conclusion as to the general value of a standard from the actual yield of any one or two years being found to be above or below it. 126.

D. Campbell, then third member of the Board of Revenue, who instituted inquiries into the Revenue administration of the district. The result was the resolution to establish a survey field assess ment after the plan which had been adopted in the Ceded Districts. The peculiar facilities which, it was now considered, Tanjore offered for the carry ing out of this measure and the modus operandi by which it was to be carried out were explained in a letter from Government to the Board of Revenue, dated 3rd April 1827, thus :\u2014 \"Para. 4. The principal object in visiting Tanjore was to ascertain whether there was any insuperable obstacle to the making of the Revenue settle- ment by a fixed money assessment and whether such a settlement would be acceptable to the people. The danger of prices falhng and remain- ing low for several successive years has always been the main objection to a fixed money assessment. From all that could be learnt on the spot during the short stay of the Honor- able the Governor in the Province, it appeared that the Mirasidars or land owners, but particularly the more substantial ones, were in general de- sirous of having a fixed money as- sessment on the land, provided it be moderate, and of being relieved from all interference except in the collec- tion of their rents."], [620, "586 \"5 \"6. The establishment of a fixed money as- sessment ought to be more easy in Tanjore than in most other Provinces, because none of them have a supply of water so certain and abundant as Tanjore has from the Cauvery and because the distribution upon the Mirasidars severally of the sum im- posed upon the village, which in most other provinces is the most difficult part of the process, is in Tanjore the most easy, because the relative value of the lands or fields to each other having long been known and the share which each Mirasidar was to pay of the whole assessment having long been settled among themselves, they would continue under the fixed assessment, whether it might be higher or lower than the present or any former one, to pay according to the usual proportions, and each man would take care that no more than his fair share was imposed upon him. The chief difficulty in Tanjore will be in determining the sum to be laid on each village, because there is a very great want of accounts for the guid- ance of the Collector on which any dependence can be placed. There are only some defective accounts of produce for the early years of the Company's administration, and none hardly during the long interval of the subsequent leases. There can be no doubt however that among up-"], [621, "587 \"7 wards of four thousand villages com prised in the province, many are assessed at their just amount. By taking these villages as a standard and by employing the Mirasidars of them in conjunction with the Revenue servants to assess the contiguous villages at the same rate, in relation to their produce, the same scale of assessment may be gradually extend ed over all the villages of the province. When this is effected, there will be little difficulty in distributing the amount upon the several properties and fields. The situation of Tanjore is singular, because, though placed on this side of the peninsula, the main part of its produce depends upon the rains of Malabar. It therefore frequently happens that in seasons when there is a scarcity in the adjoining districts, it enjoys the double advantage of an abundant harvest with scarcity prices. As Government has always partaken in this advantage, under the system of a land revenue founded on a com- mutation of a share of the produce for money at the market price ; it probably realizes as much revenue by following the old usage as it would by adopting any other, and it may therefore be thought that no change is necessary. If we looked only to Revenue, this might be true; but if we look to the constant vexatious inter-"], [622, "588 Mr. Kindersley's Survey andj Settle ment. ference with the Ryots in the reap ing and removing of their crops,*185) to the fraudulent collusion between them and the inferior Revenue ser vants in pilfering the grain, and to the general corruption in the supe rior Revenue servants which such a system encourages, we cannot but feel the necessity of endeavouring to substitute a system less liable to abuse. Although a fixed money assessment on the land may for some years rather diminish than augment the Revenue, the Governor in Council is persuaded, that it will augment it in time by facilitating the culture of products more valuable than grain, by rendering the proprietors more substantial and by thus enabling them to extend their cultivation and to bear without remission the losses of unfavourable seasons.\" 127. A survey was accordingly commenced in 1827 by Mr. Campbell, who succeeded Mr. Cotton in the office of Principal Collector, and was completed by Mr. N. W. Kindersley, who succeeded him soon after. The taluk first taken up was Shiyali, where the survey and classification were simultaneously carried out and had been nearly completed when Mr. Kindersley took charge of the Collectorate in February 1828. The gentleman last named conduct ed the survey of the rest of the district in the course of the three years, 1828-1830, and introduced, during (185).

The Pimash accounts too gave in detail the means of irrigation of each Katlay and its situation as to its receiving the water sooner or later than others. All these checks were applied in the Huzzoor Cutcherry, and when suspicion arose, a minute investigation was made ; complaints of inequality of assessment by individuals were imme diately attended to, and the accounts never confirm ed till all were satisfied.\" 132. The whole plan may be briefly summed up thus: \u2014 The Olungu money assessment itself, modi fied according to the extent of cultivation and the circumstances of the village generally at the time of the settlement, was adopted as the village total, and was distributed over the fields, assigning to each its proper share agreeably to their existing classification and allotment into shares. The commutation price for the Nansei produce was not interfered with except in four Maghanams of the Shiyali taluk, where it was slightly modified.*196) 133. The effect of the modification of the Olungu assessment was generally to increase, and in some cases reduce, the village total. It was increased (195). This account was made out under Mr. Wallace's administration in Fasli 1215. (See page 35.) Mr. Kindersley's statement which connects it with Mr. Cotton's Olungu settlement in Fasli 1232, is apparently incorrect. (196). Mr. Kindersley's report, 26th May 1830, p. 40."], [628, "594 generally in all rented(i9l) villages, where there was an increase in the cultivated area, though in most cases not to the full extent of, or in any definite proportion to, it ; in some cases no increase was made though there was an increase in the cultivated area ; while in some few an increase was made beyond the survey excess. The Olungu assessment was reduced in all villages which had remained long under Amani ; the test employed as to the extent of the abatement required having been generally the actual realizations of a long series of years ; in these cases the persistent refusal of the Mirasidars for a series of years to accede to a settlement on the Olungu stand ard was accepted as fair proof of that standard being too high. In short, Mr. Kindersley's survey assessment was a confirmation, with such modifica tions as subsequent experience suggested, of Mr. Cotton's Olungu assessment, only converting into a fixed demand an assessment which, in the case of Nansei, was variable with price. 134. The foregoing remarks apply in the main also to the assessment fixed on lands other than Nansei. But the established rate of assessment for garden cultivation was restricted to crops raised by irrigation; those nourished by moisture percolating from adjoining streams, as well as those grown with the aid of falling rain alone, being classed and assessed as Punsei.*198) 135. The extent to which Mr. Kindersley's survey assessment was carried into effect and its financial result compared with the Olungu settle ment will be noticed further on. (197). This term is used to distinguish villages of which the Mirasidars had entered into a contract for the payment of the Government dues under the rules of the Olungu settlement, from those which, in default of such contract, were dealt with under Amani, i.e. the sharing system.

The Board of Revenue and Government The whple settie disapproved of the whole settlement, because the by^the BoMcT^nd approved plan of a classification and assessment of overnment fields in the first instance by Taramdars or As- sessors was not followed. 137. Mr. Kindersley proceeded under the im pression, that the Olungu grain standard was to be assumed as the foundation of his settlement, and that it was to be modified so far only as was neces sary to rectify inequalities as between village and village. Quoting the orders of Government, dated 30th December 1823 and 3rd April 1827,*199) he said*200) :\u2014 \"In the conduct of the survey, I have all along considered that it was to the standard grain beriz that we must look as the guide to our operations and the test of their results. I have always borne in mind the declaration of Government, that by what ever process the desirable object (a fixed field assess ment) might be arrived at, it must not be made higher than the Olungu beriz, nor fixed upon diff erent principles, producing a less favorable result to the Mirasidars; that its object was to equalize, not to raise, the scale of assessment, but that at the same time the Government was entitled to derive benefit from the more complete development of the resources of the country which might be expected as the consequence of a survey.\" The Board pointed out,*201) that the first quoted order had been superseded by the one dated 21st February 1826.*202) \" The opinion of Government,\" they said, \"was distinctly expressed on this occasion (199).

But however this may have been, it appears clearly from the orders now quoted, that the Government did not consider itself pledged to observe the Olungu settle- ment as a fixed limit to their demands even under the old system, but actually contemplated and pro- vided for its increase under certain defined circum- stances, reserving to itself to determine upon receiv- ing full information of the resources of the country, whether any further change should be made. It was expected that the survey would completely discover the resources of the country, and it is mani- fest from the instructions for the performance of this work, that the assessment was intended to be settled de novo ; the Principal Collector being left free to exercise his own discretion without any re striction whatever in respect of the Olungu settle ment. * * * * \" The view of Government in ordering the survey,\" the Board added, \" was rather to ascertain the re sources of the country and to equalize the assessment"], [631, "597 than to obtain a greater revenue ; but to equalize the assessment, it is necessary to raise the assessment of such villages as prove to be under-assessed as well as to lower the assessment of those which prove to be over-assessed.\" 138. It is unnecessary to recite the various minor objections taken by the Board, and concurred in by Government, to the assessment formed by Mr. Kindersley. On an elaborate analysis of its details, the Board concluded their review as follows: \u2014 *203) \" 51. On the whole it appears that the assess- ment of the villages has not been deter mined upon definite principles and agreeably to fixed rules, but that the proposed amount of it has, in the first instance, been assumed in an arbitrary manner at discretion, and that the subsequent settlement has in general been really nothing more or less than a bargain or composition, the result of a negotiation between the Revenue officers on the one side and the Mirasidars on the other, in which each party endeavoured to gain the best terms possible, and of course, as usual in such transactions, the most obstinate would generally have the advantage. * * * It appears to the Board that, without a previous examination and estimation of the lands of the different villages in detail by Assessors, the Revenue servants could not be in possession of a knowledge of the resources of the villages sufficient to enable them (203). p. 114. ante. 76"], [632, "598 to maintain the just rights of Govern ment in their negotiations with the Mirasidars, and that not only where the latter were obstinate, but where they may have most readily agreed to their terms, there is reason to apprehend they may, without a corrupt motive, have given up from ignorance, what, upon a more accu rate and perfect knowledge, they would not have conceded. Thus, in a negotiation of this nature, the Mirasid&rs would most likely be suc cessful, even on the supposition of entire fair dealing. But the mode of settlement, which leaves everything to discretion, affords so much room for corruption and with so little check, that honesty and fair dealing could hardly be expected. Where an addi tion is made at the discretion of the Sarrishtadar's without anything to shew the grounds of his decision, and abatements are subsequently made in like manner, it is very easy to act with partiality without suspicion, or should suspicion arise, without the possibility of its being proved. \"52. It being, as the Principal Collector himself avows, impossible to form a judgment of the correctness of the assessment of the villages by means of the accounts ; all that the Board can do is to judge of the probability of correct results being arrived at by the process which was followed as"], [633, "599 \"61 described by him. In the observ ations that have been already made, their opinion is implied that there is no ground for confidence in the correctness of the assessment result ing from that process. They think there is reason to presume, from the large share the Mirasidars have had in settling it, that it is not generally unfavourable to their interests ; but they apprehend that it is unequal, and they doubt that the interest of Government have been duly provided for in those villages in which the resources have been augmented in consequence of the improvement of irrigation at their cost. In short, the Board have no assurance that the objects, which the Government had specially in view in directing the survey, have been attained. Upon the whole, the conclusion, to which the Board are reluctantly compelled by the most deliberate and careful consideration of the subject, is, that the assessment of the villages is founded upon too uncertain grounds to warrant the adoption of it as the basis of a permanent settlement of the revenue of Government, and that a complete revision is necessary pro- ceeding upon a thorough investiga- tion of the resources of the villages, with reference to the survey ac- counts * * *\""], [634, "600 Settlement already introduced, left un disturbed. Extent to which it had been actually in troduced. These views were fully endorsed by Govern- ment.*201) 139. Under the circumstances, however, which will be presently explained, the effect of the decision thus come to, was merely to prevent the further extension of the settlement which Mr. Kindersley had already carried out. 140. Mr. Kindersley introduced his settlement first in the three taluks of Shiyali, Tiruvadi and Pattukk6ttei, and submitted a detailed report there on, stating its financial result, on the 26th May 1830. On an examination of it and of the further information, furnished by Mr. Kindersley at their request, the Board on the 8th October 1830 sent him instructions to put a stop to the progress of the assessment until a final decision should be come to on the work already done, allowing the survey to be carried on to completion ; these instructions the Board com municated to Mr. Kindersley privately, in order that he might be enabled to stay his proceedings in such a manner as might prevent any misapprehen sion on the part of the people. Subsequently, with the sanction of Government, the Board called Mr. Kindersley to the Presidency, and after obtaining in person from him and his servants who accompanied him, such further explanation as they required in regard to the accounts of the settlement, as well as on all doubtful points in his report, recorded their final conclusion in full and minute detail, as above shown, in their proceedings dated 2nd May 1831. 141. At this date, the Board's impression ap parently was that, up to the 30th November 1830 when, as they believed, its progress was stopped in consequence of the instructions they had privately (204). Letter from Government to Board, 29th November 1831."], [635, "601 communicated to him, Mr. Kindersley's settlement had not progressed further than the fixing of the village assessment ; that this had been done in all for 2,674 out of a total number of 4,711 villages; that accounts of the distribution of the village assessment over the fields and among individual ryots had been prepared for only 759 out of those villages, and that in none had the detailed field assessment been brought into operation. Mr. Kindersley, in his report of the 26th May 1830, had indeed stated that the survey assessment had been acted upon in Fasli 1238 in 708 villages in the taluks of Shiyali, Tiruvadi, and Pattukkottei, and had included in his review of the result of the settle ment for that year, 108 more villages in those taluks, which, he said, had also been settled upon the new assessment, but of which the accounts had not been completed in time to admit of its being introduced in that year. But apparently the Board overlooked this fact and attached no significance to the fact that the consent of the Mirasidars had been obtained to the village beriz as finally settled, presumably, in the case of the whole number of villages above specified, viz., 2674. \" In the view which the Board have taken,\" they said,*205' it appears to them a fortunate circumstance that nothing had been settled by the Principal Collector but the beriz of villages and that the detailed assessment of the lands by fields remains undetermined. The Mirasidars are aware that the engagements with respect to the villages are subject to the revision of the Board and the Government, and liable to be annulled if disapproved. The mode in which those engagements have been concluded being in the most important points at variance with the orders of Government, in itself affords a suffi- (205). Para. 61."], [636, "602 cient ground for setting them aside, and the Govern ment seems to be entirley free to do so if it be judg ed expedient.*206) 142. The Government, concurring with the Board, communicated their decision in the following terms : \u2014 \" The Right Honorable the Governor in Council is resolved to annul that portion of the survey assessment which has been effected, * * * * and he desires that hereafter, in the recommence ment of the work, the original instructions of Govern ment may be adhered to as closely as possible.\" 143. In conveying these instructions to Mr. Kindersley, however, the Board desired*207) to have his opinion as to whether, until the introduction of an assessment on the plan originally sanctioned, it would be advisable to revert, in the villages where he had introduced a new assessment, to the system which formerly prevailed, or to continue to make the collections according to the beriz imposed by him. They were \" inclined,\" they added, \" to consider the latter the preferable course.\" 144. Mr. Kindersley in his reply*208) gave the preference to the course last indicated ; \" lstly. Because to revert to the former system would, by publishing the disapproval of my measures by your Board and Govern ment, entirely destroy my personal influ ence in the district, without which it would be impossible for me to succeed in accomplishing the wishes of Govern- ment. \" 2ndly.

The fourth of the grounds enumerated by Mr. Kindersley disclosed the fact that his survey assessment had been carried further than the settle ment of village beriz, and the Board having then called upon him \" to explain distinctly what has been done, how it has been done, and in what manner it is productive of the advantages\" which he ascribed to it ;*209) Mr. Kindersley, on the 14th March 1832, transmitted a statement showing specifically the pro gress which had been actually made up to that date in carrying out his survey assessment. This showed that, out of 2,567 villages which comprised the 8 taluks named below, 21\u00b0) the village beriz had been settled in 2,480, and that in these latter, pro gress towards a detailed settlement by fields and holdings had been made thus far : \u2014 Number of villages.

After stating again at some length the advantages of his settlement over that which it superseded, Mr. Kindersley asked in urgent terms to be permitted to carry it on to com pletion in the eight taluks above named, and to act upon it, until the introduction of a survey assess ment upon the principles laid down by Government, \"which,\" he added, \" it is allowed must be a work of time.\" The remaining seven taluks,*211) he said, \" will afford an ample field for the attempt which certainly cannot be facilitated, though it may be frustrated, by the intermediate relinquishment of the advantages of the present settlement in the other half of the district.\" 147.

And entertaining that opinion, and advert ing to the very small portion of these taluks into which the assessment appears not to have been in troduced in more or less detail and to the importance attached by the Principal Collector to his being allowed to complete it throughout them, the Board think it expedient on the whole, under the circum stances of the case as now before them, that this further permission should also be granted him.\" The Government, entirely concurring in the Board's views, accorded their further permission.*213) End of the history 148.

The village beriz, in the case of these villages, was brought into operation therefore in the following year (Fasli 1240), under the designation \" Money rented for one year,\" and of this arrange ment Mr. Kindersley wrote in his Jamabandi report for the year last mentioned (para. 9) thus : \u2014 \" The 540 villages ' Money rented for one year,' your Board will perceive, form a new head.

With regard to the villages in 3 out of the remaining 7 taluks in which Muchalikas had been taken but not acted upon in Fasli 1239, I was reduced to the dilemma of either returning to their former mode of settlement, the annual option of the Olungu rent, or a division of the crops, and thereby surrendering a largely en hanced beriz (which, however, would have been the least part of the evil), or of making my collections according to these Muchalikas, but without prose cuting the assessment to completion.

Mr. Kindersley, however, did not act to the full extent upon the authority given him to complete his survey assessment in the eight taluks specified in para. 145 ; for in Fasli 1269 (A.D. 1859), when, as will be seen presently, the Government authorised the extension of his village assessment to the rest of the district, there remained a few villages in four of those eight taluks under Olungu. Neither did he carry out the detailed field assessment in all those villages in which he had settled the lump assess ment. The precise extent to which he eventually carried out his settlement, severally in these two forms, does not appear in his Jamabandi or any other (215.) This took place after the extension of Mottamfaisal in 1869. The Collector in his letter of the 20th July 1860, No. 214, asked for formal sanc tion, but no reply was sent on this point apparently by oversight. The change was nevertheless carried out latterly. The 54-0 villages appear a \" Money rented for one year\" in Jamabandi Reports down to Fasli 1269."], [643, "609 reports. At the date just mentioned, matters stood thus : \u2014 Number of villages in which a detailed field assessment had been introduced 1,818 Number of villages which had been assessed in the gross, including the 540 referred to in the preceding para 1,261 Total... 3,079*21<5) The total number of Government villages in the district, including those under Olungu, Amani, &c, at the commencement of Fasli 1269, was 4,885.

The settle ment, it has been seen, was intended to be only pre liminary to a detailed field assessment ; its having become confirmed in that form is thus a mere acci dent. (216.) Of the 1,818 field assessed villages, one called Naduttittu, an island in the Coleroon where the Lower Anikut is built, was transferred from Trichi nopoly to Tanjore after the construction of this work in 1837 (Fasli 1247). It had been assessed on the plan of a detailed field assessment while attached to Trichinopoly. Excepting this, therefore, the total number of villages com prised in Mr. Kindersley's settlement was 3,078.

Survey results considered first. 151. Before proceeding to the subsequent exten sion of the Mottamfaisal settlement, it seems proper to take a brief view of the result of Mr. Kindersley's settlement in comparison with the Olungu. It does not appear that Mr. Kindersley submitted a com plete report embracing the entire area of his opera tions, and the non-submission of such a report seems to be easily conceivable, considering the somewhat peculiar circumstances under which his proceedings terminated. The review that follows is restricted, therefore, to the area embraced in Mr. Kindersley's report of the 26th May 1830, on which the Board and Government passed their decision as above shown. This area comprised 816 out of the 883 Government villages in three taluks, viz., Shiyali, Tiruvadi and Pattukkottei.*218) 152. The following table abstracted from a sub sequent compilation showing, for the whole District, the areas under different heads according to Mr. Kindersley's survey in comparison with the old mea surement may be an useful preface. These areas are exclusive of the villages comprising the private estate of the late Raja, and also those which consti tute the tax-free endowments of the Raja's chattrums or charitable institutions.

With reference to the average ofthe six years from Fasli 1232 to 1237, it must be observed, that, under the Olungu system, the current selling price was the key to the revenue. Its average range in Tiruvadi during this period was 19^ per cent.*223) above the Olungu standard ; and the average revenue of rented villages had increased therefore by 9^ per cent.*224) over that standard; in Amani villages it had risen to the full extent of the 19^ per cent.*225) Further, while the average of six years was so high, the prices of the last two of those years (Faslis 1236 and 1237) were about 25 per cent, below the Olungu standard, and as it has been already seen to what extent the state of the grain market used to influence the Mirasidars' choice of a settlement on a fixed money assessment, it is obvious that there must have been great difficulty in obtaining the consent of the Mirasidars to an assessment the commutation rate of which was so far above the current prices of the two years next pre ceding. 160. As to the relative proportions of the new as sessment and the average collections of the previous six years to the area comprised in each ; it must be observed, that when land lying waste for a long series of years, which must be necessarily less pro ductive, is brought under settlement, the resulting increase of revenue cannot be fairly expected to bear the same or nearly the same ratio to it that the previous revenue did to the area from which it was realized.

Pattukkottei and the Kadarambham portion of Tiruvadi were altogether beyond the influence of river irrigation and poorly cultivated ; and from the comparatively very small amount of revenue they yielded, these parts of the country had received very little attention. As might have been expected, therefore, the proportion of the increase obtained by Mr. Kindersley's survey assess ment was considerably lower in the Nirarambham part of Tiruvadi than in any other part of the country above specified.

Having regard, therefore, to the peculiar disadvantages under which the Olungu villages thus laboured, remissions were made out of the excess demand for price in Faslis 1263, 1265 and 1267*22?) which were exceptionally unfavourable years. This year (Fasli 1268) the district had suffered very heavily from excessive rain and floods*228) ; the price of grain, which had maintained a high range for the last five years, rose this year to 169 per cent.*229' above the Olungu commutation rate, and the amount of relief, which it was found necessary to grant to the Mirasidars of the Olungu villages, was pro portionately high.

But owing to the absence, in many cases, of clearly defined boundaries, it was difficult to ascertain what the actual extent comprised in the Olungu standard was. Some increase was made on the whole to the Olungu assessment, but necessarily not in a proportion corresponding to the increase of area. On the other hand, where the village had long remained under Amani by reason, presumably, of over-assessment, and the actual realisations were considerably less, the Olungu stand ard was lowered. The plan adopted was in the main the same as that of Mr. Kindersley's settlement. At the same time, lands designated \"Manavari,\" Manavari Nansei ' \u00b0 . transferred to the i.e., those on which a crop of coarse paddy is head Punsei. grown with the aid of falling rain alone, and which had been classed as Nansei, were transferred to the class of Punsei and assessed at Punsei rates.

The reduction of assessment in these two cases amounted to upwards of 12,000 Rupees. 79"], [656, "622 A ssessment of Q ar. den lands. Term of the Settle ment 168. It has been seen, that Mr. Kindersley had restricted the garden assessment to lands irrigated by lift ; but in those parts of the District to which his settlement had not extended, the old classification of lands as garden with reference to the description of crops and the practice of permanently adding to the garden area land once cultivated with a crop classed as garden continued. Having regard, how ever, to the fact that the garden cultivation in Tanjore is carried on chiefly on river Padugeis (i.e., lands between the embankments and deep beds of streams) which, being annually overflowed, are en riched by successive alluvial deposits, and, owing to percolation from streams, need no irrigation ; Mr. Ramayyangar, with the sanction of Government,*233) treated as garden all lands shown as such in the Karnam's accounts of the previous year, and charged the survey excess alone as dry. Subsequently, under general instructions from Government, garden culti vation under private wells or with the aid of falling rain alone, without the advantages of situation above described, was classed as dry, and such hardship as existed in this respect removed. The Padugei lands exempted by Mr. Kindersley's settlement were brought under garden assessment, which is levied accordingly even when crops not classed as garden are cultivated. 1 69. The term of the settlement, as defined in the Muchalika or agreement taken fromthe Mirasidars in token of their assent in the form approved by the Board of Revenue,*234' is \" till any further revision that may be considered necessary.\" In his letter with which (233.)

But there is apparently a material difference. In the English translation of the Muchalika taken at the earlier settlement, which the Collector forwarded to the Board at the same time, the clause relating to the duration of the settlement stands thus : \u2014 \" As we have consented to the settlement for the present Fasli, 1238, we shall continue to pay tirva in every succeeding year according to the fixed Tarams (rates of assessment).\" A literal rendering of the clause in the original Tamil Muchalika, of which likewise the Collector transmitted a copy at the same time, is as follows : \u2014 As permanent rates of assessment (235) have been imposed in this Fasli, 1238, and we have agreed thereto, we shall continue to pay assessment at the rate charged on each number (plot).\" Both ver sions seem to bear about the same meaning ; but Mr. Kindersley's settlement was not accepted as bind ing on Government,(236) and the wording of the agreement taken by him from the Mirasidars cannot give it, therefore, a more durable tenure than is ex pressly secured by the form of document adopted, with the approval of the Board, at the subsequent extension of the settlement. 170.

Taking the remaining 1,545 villages, the increase of area brought to account was 7\"3 per cent. ; but the increase made to the amount of assessment was only 2-18 per cent, over the Olungu standard.

The first standard taken for comparison, it is to be observed, does not represent the amount that was leviable under the Olungu system ; for it does not include the excess demand on account of the increase in the actual selling over the commuta tion price. 172. As already shown, the excess demand for price on Olungu villages in Fasli 1268 came to as much as Rs. 19,24,117, of which the portion actual-"], [659, "625 ly realised was Rs. 10,05,309. In Fasli 1269, the year of the extension of Mottamfaisal, the price fell off 40 per cent, below that of Fasli 1268 ;*237) and yet the increase by price that would have been added to the demand under the Olungu rules on the 1,497 villages*238) brought under Mottamfaisal that year was Rs. 5,93,072. On this the Board of Revenue observed : \u2014 \" This sum at first sight appears to be the amount actually lost by the introduction of the change of system ; but it must be borne in mind that this ex cess would never have been wholly collected under the old practice, but would have been in part remit ted.\" Why would it never have been wholly col lected ? If the assessment represented a moderate share of a correctly estimated quantity of produce, the application thereto of the actual selling price could not have rendered the resulting demand exces sive. 173. Obviously the previous over assessment im plied by the Board's remark consisted not in the valuation but in the determination of the taxable proportion of the produce.

When the current selling ranged below the standard commutation price, the Mirasidars of the villages assessed in money were necessarily weighed down by the pressure of the Government demand; for they had to pay the Govern ment share of the produce at more than its actual value. 174.

It will be seen that the rate of reduction in assessment in the later Mottamfaisal settlement is lower in Nansei than in the total made up of Nansei, Punsei, and other lands. This is owing to the trans fer of Manavari lands to the head of Punsei at re duced rates of assessment, and in some cases the re duction of Punsei rates themselves.

(See p. 119 and 120 ante). 179. A brief account will now be given of the fifty villages, which have been referred to before as having a history of their own. These form the low sandy plain in the south-eastern part of the district near the coast, and comprise an area of 144,120 acres, or 225 square miles. 180. The following extract from Mr. Kindersley's Jamabandi Eeport for Fasli 1241 contains a full and clear description of the soil and situation of this tract, the mode of agriculture followed therein and the conditions which render the ordinary Ryotwari system of Revenue administration inapplicable to it;\u2014 \" Para 30. The great peculiarity of these villages is, that what are called Nanjah lands have no means of irrigation either from rivers or tanks ; but being low and sandy and having a substratum of clay ; the falling rains are retained upon the fields by the erection of an embankment round each, and in a favourable, i.e. a wet season, produce an inferior kind of rice called Cootalay ; the crop scarcely ever exceeding 40 Callams per Valey, and so uncertain is the supply of water, that it is usual, with the paddy, to sow Oodaroo, a species of dry grain. If the season proves wet, the paddy succeeds and the"], [667, "633 Codaroo perishes ; if dry, vice versa. Bagayet, as your Board is aware, implies in Tanjore not, as in other districts, a class of land, viz., dry lands irri gated by manual labour and cultivated with any other produce than rice, but lands cultivated with certain kinds(214) of produce, whether irrigated or not. Many of these, and amongst them even the Chayaroot, will grow in favoured spots in the soil above described, without any irrigation at all ; and some of them as Indigo flourish on high beds of sand ; others as Tobacco are watered from pot wells, the lands being very highly manured, chiefly with leaves collected at considerable cost in the jungles, and some as Ragy and Cumboo are irrigated from pits of 6 or 7 feet deep scooped in the sand ; but in a dry season, fields and wells ancl all are dry. The lands are generally so poor as to require to be frequently left fallow, unless richly manured, which can only be the case with a small portion, and from year to year, the variation in the produce is so great, that the same land may be cultivated Nunjah in one, Poonjah in another, and Bagayet in a third, and in the same year, where one kind of crop has failed, another is sown, and the cultivator's perseverance is generally rewarded with some kind of crop. \"31. It is manifest, that the introduction of any regular system into villages so situated must be attended with difficulties, and that the lowest scale of assessment would yield but a fluctuating revenue if cramped by a strict adherence to the rules, else where so desirable, of Nanjah, Poonjah, and Bagayet, one crop, two crops, &c. Great latitude must be allowed to the cultivator to enable him to raise a crop at all, and the chance of great profit in a favourable season held out to stimulate his industry (2 41.)

Jn them it is especially necessary to get rid of that appre hension, which has so baneful an influence in revenue arrangements, of the ryot occasionally making a profit in which the Government will not immediately share, without reference to the ultimate benefit to be derived from the improved state of the land, the increased prosperity of the people themselves and the intermediate advantage of a steady and easily realised revenue.\" Mode of settlement 181. During the days of the Raja's Government, observed during the . , days of the Raja's lt appears, \" these villages were rented out at rates eariier'yearsTf Bri^ intended rather to encourage settlement than to tish rule. raise revenue.\" After the British acquisition of the province, they were for twenty-two years (Faslis 1210 to 1231) dealt with partly under Amani and partly under lease settlements. In Fasli 1232, it is said, Mr. Cotton's Set- Mr. Cotton settled upon these villages, for a term of five years, a \" Kattuguttagei\"(245) or consohdated assessment on the entire village area, which accorded to the Mirasidars perfect liberty of action in regard to the extent of land to be brought under the plough and the crops to be raised, without any enhancement of demand. It was stated by Mr. Kindersley in 1832(246) and by Mr. Henry Forbes 1854(247) that this settlement had not been reported to the Board of Revenue ; but there is nothing on record to show that Mr. Cotton formed any special settlement for these villages. The fact seems to be merely that these 50 villages were among the 284, the Mirasidars of which, at the introduction of the Olungu settle ment, agreed to money assessments for a term of five (245.) A Tamil compound made up of \" Kattu\" fixed, and \" kuttagei\" rent. By the loose system of transliteration formerly in vogue, this term assumed various shapes, the earliest and most common being \" Kutgootah.\" (246.) Jamabandi report for FaBli 1241. (247.)

The first mention of \" Kattu guttagei,\" so far as it can be seen, occurs in Mr. Kindersley's Jamabandi report for Fasli 1241. 182. The average revenue of these fifty villages, for the ten years preceding Mr. Cotton's settlement in Fasli 1232, was Rs. 25,750(248). Mr. Cotton's settlement which took for its basis the highest amount of revenue realized by the Raja's Government, was Rs. 40,515, inclusive of the Kaval fees resumed during the intermediate period/249) the amount of which was Rs. 3,395. 183. In Fasli 1237, when the term of five years originally agreed to had expired and Mr. Cotton had left the district, the Sub-Collector, Mr. Nelson, raised the amount of the original settlement to Rs. 60,170, assessing at the village average all recent extension of cultivation, and brought the villages under the rigid rules of the Olungu system, with the only variation that the demand was not to fluctuate with price. Under the Olungu rules, it has been seen, (p. 119), land once broken up was permanently added to the dittum (settlement area) with a pro portionate increase to the village assessment ; but no remission was ever, under any circumstances, allowed for land left fallow or relinquished. It has been seen also, that an accession to the second crop assessment became equally permanent, whether a second crop continued to be raised or not. In the words of Mr. Forbes, \" if, after having once plough- (248.) Presumably this does not include Kaval fees. (249.)

Mr. Forbes, in his letter dated 9th September 1854, described their condition thus : \u2014 \" The people of these villages have this year been left utterly destitute ; their crops having failed and their whole property having gone by degrees to satisfy the Government demand of former years, they have had nothing whatever to fall back upon ; the able-bodied have either emigrated to the Mauri tius, taken their labour to Ceylon, or left their villages to work in the Nirarambham Taluks, and the aged and the young, alike unfit for labour, have been fed by the thousand at the public expense, as the sole means of preserving them alive. From enquiries I have made I am led to believe, that there is not, in any Kadarambham village, a woman who owns a golden ornament, nor a family possessing a brass pot ; everything has been sold, and the State must now be prepared to bear the inevitable result of over assessing its ryots and consent to a considerable sacrifice of revenue.\" 187.

This plan, however, was not found practica ble, and eventually, therefore, a Kattuguttagei settle ment was concluded by Mr. H. D. Phillips, the next Collector, at the annual sum of Rs. 47,391, out of which he was authorised to remit 15 per cent, for the first five of the seven years' term. In finally conclud ing the settlement, Mr. Phillips excluded one small hamlet, then counted as one village, which was under river irrigation, and had nothing in common with the rest, and the remaining 49 were reduced, by the clubbing together of small contiguous villages at the revision of the Village Establishments in 1867, to 46, of which 39 belong to Tiruttureipundi and 7 to the Negapatam Taluk. 189. The Board in according their sanction to this settlement, added : \u2014 \" They believe that the soundest system of taxing the land is to place upon its divisions a fixed and moderate assessment, and give each proprietor individual independence and the full benefit of any improvement which he makes by any outlay of capital or labour.

On the expiry of the term of this The Kattuguttagei settlement, the then Collector, Mr. George pi,T 0f the seven Lee Morris, reported^-01' that a succession of badyears eim' seasons had prevented the Mirasidars from realiz- ing, to any considerable extent, the benefits which its liberal terms were intended to ensure to them, and as further no means existed at the time for giving effect to the wishes expressed by the Board in 1854, he asked for permission to maintain the existing settlement until a more suitable one could be introduced. The Board in assenting to the proposal, desired the Collector to \"consider The Board ask for r k r a rep0rt, as to sur whether it would not be advisable to survey the vii- veying the villages and introducing a lages, in view to the Fieldwar assessment being Fieidwar assessment introduced, and to propose such measures as may be necessary to carry it into effect. \"(25a) 191. Mr. Morris, like Messrs. Cotton, Kindersley, Mr. Morris' plan and Forbes, was of opinion, that a settlement, on 0n modified terms! the principle of a detailed valuation of fields and a demand annually varying with the extent of land actually occupied, was unsuited to the peculiar con dition of these villages with their detached spots of cultivation scattered over extensive sandy tracts. He considered that the Kattuguttagei, with such modi fications both in the total and detail as later experi ence had suggested, should be maintained. He wished at the same time also to establish a record of individual holdings, with the share of the lump assessment chargeable on each, which hither to was left entirely to Karnams. Mr. Morris deputed a Deputy Collector to examine in detail the condition of each village and to prepare a scheme of a revised Kattuguttagei on this plan. (254.)

As is the case with the villages under the Mottamfaisal settlement, the tenure of holdings is nothing but Ryotwari with individual rights and liabilities. It is the absence of a record of individual holdings in the Collector's or Tahsildar's Cutcherry that makes all the difference ; but the difference refers merely to the form of procedure. The Karnam keeps such a record and deals with the Mirasidars individually. (257) (256.)

It is on account of the Mirasidars not agreemg to Mottamfaisal that Cauvery still continues under Olungu. The standard assessment above specified is more than doubled by the addition of the excess demand for price under the Olungu rules, and the Mirasidars have held out now for twenty vears, with the loss which the present system thus entails upon them, under Uie expectation, that by so doing they might secure attention to au alleged grievance in respect of a channel winch irrigates this along with a larger village of theirs, which latter, however, they have been car' :: a enough to get converted to Mottamfaisal.

Owing, however, to the lands not being assessed in detail, the assessment on each holding, calculated at the village average, is enter ed in these documents in a lump for each des cription of cultivation, viz., Nansei, Punsei and Gar den, comprised in it. This, however, does not intro duce any appreciable inequality in the apportionment of the assessment, inasmuch as the village lands are held generally in shares, each made up of an equal proportion of lands of all the different degrees of fertility. Sales of land by private agreement or Courts' decrees, as likewise partition among co-heirs, take place also generally by shares. The only way in which the assessment is likely to be unequally distributed is by sales for arrears of revenue, in which it is not possible to conform to village shares. The selection of fields or distinct plots for sale is (260.)

Nansei assessment. 200. The Nansei or wet assessment under the Mottamfaisal and Fieldwar settlements is based in the main on the village grain standards, known as Olungu, fixed by Mr. Cotton in 1822,(263) the Melvaram or the Government share \"of the produce, after deducting the usual village fees, being taken at 50 per cent, for the river-irrigated, and 45 per cent. for the tank-irrigated lands/264) and converted into money at a commutation price fixed for each Magha nam on an average of the selling prices of the five years, 1815-16 to 1819-20.C265) The Olungu grain standards were deduced generally from the money assessment, which prevailed under the previous Lease settlements ;(266) and that money assessment was based, as regards both produce and price, more or less on the Amani results of the first four years of the British administration, 1800-1 to 1 803-4. (26?) As al ready shown, however, these data were considerably (262). Government Order.'llth February 1876, No. 182. (263). paras. 129 and 170. (254). p. 81. (265). p. 82. (266). p. 83.

The Punsei assessment, like the Nansei standards, is based chiefly on the Amani outturn of dry grain lands in the early years of the British rule, and, like it, has undergone modifications at each successive settlement. The Melvaram rate adopted was generally 60 per cent, of the gross produce less the usual village fees, and the commutation prices were more or less the selling prices of the years 1800-1 to 1806-7. Originally restricted to lands on which dry grains were cultivated, the Punsei assess ment has latterly been extended, with one unim portant exception/269) to lands on which other crops are cultivated without any irrigation or with the aid of percolation from river channels, or under private wells/270) On the whole, the Punsei assessment in Tanjore is especially moderate. In Mottamfaisal villages, there is one uniform rate for each village, and in the field-assessed villages, the village assess ment is distributed over the fields according to their relative values. 202. This, in its present form of land assessment, was fixed in 1807-8. It represents the average of Mr. Harris' original rates (established in 1800) on as many of the thirty-two kinds classed by him as gar den crops/271) as happened in the three previous years (268.) p. 90.

This is levied on fruit trees (only when bearing), and refers to the number and description of trees and not to the area planted. This system was introduced by Mr. Harris in 1800, but the rates of tax established by him have latterly undergone some modification. The tax as now levied on each tree of each description, is given in Chapter II of Part 111, p. 25.

These are the rates as last settled after the extension of the Mottamfaisal settlement in 1859 and the subsequent years, and they have become slightly (hardly appreciably) modified by the resumption of some of the village fees in connection with the revision of the village Establishment in 1868, as shown in Chap.

Grain Measure. The capacity of a Kalam of the Native Govern ment is given in an account of grain sent from Tanjore to Madras for the Company's Service in the year 1776 (Raus, appendix, vol ii, p. 1375) as 8,415 pagodas, equal to 2,524J tolas, and from its proportion to the Madras garce as therein given, it is presumable, that the capacity is given in terms of weight of rice. The capacity of the new Kalam, as reckoned down to the middle of this century at 24 Madras measures (known as \" Pattanam Padi\") of 120 tolas in rice, is 2,880 tolas, and the proportion therefore of the new to the old Kalam comes to 561 to 640. This very nearly corresponds with that given (apparently roughly) in the Committee's Report (p. 91), i. e., that 133^ new Kalams are equal to 154 old Kalams or about 15 per cent. more. The quantities of grain for Dabir's and Baccanna's settlements, as also for the two averages of years anterior to the cession of the Province, have been reduced to the new kalam by the more exact proportion of 561 new to 640 old Kalams. The capacity of the present measure, called \" Pattanam Padi,\" in Tanjore has, however, increas ed to 133 tolas in rice, and the present Kalam con taining 24 such measures, therefore, comes to 3,192 tolas. It is impossible to fix dates with respect to the progressive increase in the standard capacity of the measure, and as the quantity of produce, for the purpose of Land Revenue Settlement now in force,"], [685, "651 Remarks on the above Statistics. Dabir Muri was reckoned nearly sixty years ago (paras. 80, 83 and 85), it is evidently no use reducing the quantities to the measure now in use. 206. A few explanatory remarks will be offered on the statistics exhibited in the foregoing table, taking them as they are. 207. Mr. Grant, the Collector for the Northern Division of Tanjore, in his letter to the Board of Revenue, dated 18th June 1800, refers to the Dabir Muri thus :\u2014 \" The first and most important of these (the three different standards usually adopted) is called 'Pura Muri,' or more commonly 1 Dabir Muri,' from its having been established by a person bearing that name * * *. It is considered the full settlement for the country when in a perfect state, and is the standard up to which it is the object of Government to raise and keep the produce of the several villages.\" Mr. Grant then describes the two lower standards, called respectively, \"Damasha Muri\" and \" E'kasal Muri.\" Of these, the first was adopted for a term of years, when the deteriorated state of irrigating channels or other causes called for an in dulgent settlement; it rose annually infixed pro portions until the Pura Muri was reached. The second, lower than the first, was adopted when the condition of the village called for even more indul gence ; it was, as its name implies, intended for one year only. 208. From the Commissioner's Report it would appear that the Dabir Muri was based upon a ten year average deduced entirely from the partial state ments of landholders. If such had been the case, the Muri must be very low ; but from the comparative tables given in p. 89, it does not appear to be so, and the presumption, therefore, seems to be that the"], [686, "652 Dabir Pandit, in fixing his grain standards, had recourse also to other and more reliable data. 209. The Dabir Muri was denounced by the Board of Revenue and Government as unequal, and in many instances oppressive, and was abolished by public proclamation upon the British acquisition of the province. That it was not, however, so bad seems to be presumable from the fact, that Mr. Wallace, so soon after as 1804, used it as a test for checking the estimate of growing crops on which he formed a settlement for that year (p. 31), and that Mr. Cotton, in 1822, adopted it as one of the data from which he framed his grain standards under the first set of rules (p. 80). The condemnation of the Dabir Muri at first was based necessarily upon the report made by Mr. Harris, soon after he took charge of the Southern Division of Tanjore,' when he could not have been in a position to speak from per sonal knowledge or observation.

Amani Outturn of Fasli 1212. was seasonable in all its periods, and the benefits derivable from it were extended to all parts of the province. The periodical rains were moderate and frequent. No loss was sustained by drought or inundation. The cultivation was extended, and the harvests were most productive. They were both more considerable than had been known in Tanjore sol* many years. \" The Committee in their report dated 22nd Febru ary, 1807, (para. 98), observed : \u2014 \"It must be re membered that Fasli 1210 was the first year of the Company's undivided authority. The mode of realiz ing the Revenue was new and successful ; it is most probable that the whole produce of the lands was brought to account. It is not assuming too much to say that the vigilance of the management during Fasli 1210 and the goodness ofthe season, contrasted with the known success of the Pathakdars and Mirasidars in former times in returning, and ac tually obtaining a settlement on, a reduced produce, sufficiently accounts for the high produce of Fasli 1210, compared with the produce of former periods. The Committee cannot but admit that year to be a very favourable one, but under the circumstances stated, they have no reason to declare it to have been a yeas of unequalled produce.\" 213. This year the district was visited by an inundation ;(273) but it does not appear that the out turn of the harvest was much affected by it. 214.

This year a settlement was formed on an,,1'-1\"1!806'8* \" tlement for Fasli estimate of growing crops checked by the Amani 12i4 results of previous years. The crops, however, more especially in the eastern parts of the delta, had suffered from the scantiness of both the river freshes and local rains, and the upland parts of the district had suffered also from drought. The settle melt was, therefore, below the ordinary outturn of an average season. 218. This year a settlement was formed, to a Mr- Wallace's set J , , tlement for 1214. great extent, upon the average of the first three amani years (Faslis 1210 \u2014 1212). The average was low in consequence of Fasli 1212, which was an extremely unfavourable year, being included in it ; but the aggregate of the actual settlement for Fasli 1215, as shown in the table, became still lower by its including 595 villages, which were settled on actual produce which was scanty. The statistics of these villages alone are not separately ascertainable. 219. Of these, all the information which is avail- Subsequent settle- ments able has been given in the preceding pages. It must be observed, however, that Mr. Ramayyangar's Mottamfaisal settlement includes but a very small proportion of the non-deltaic portion of the district, the whole, or nearly the whole, of which is included in the other settlements. The statistics of the earlier settlements for the delta lands alone are not separately ascertainable. 220. The data on which the village assessments Concluding obser- vations. under the present settlement are based, have been village assess given, and from these, perhaps, an opinion may be formed as to their adequacy. The present settlement, it is to be observed, is the result, to a great extent, of the cumulative experience of years as to the actual condition of each village, the facility or difficulty of"], [690, "656 irrigation and drainage, the bearing of the previous assessment on the marketable value of land and the condition of the landholders generally. Continuous Amani management also afforded a fair idea of the pressure of the assessment ; for with an assessment that could have been paid with ease, Amani would hardly have been courted or agreed to. In 1821, the year preceding Mr. Cotton's Olungu settlement, there were no less than 1,084 villages under Amani, and in 1859, when the Mottamfaisal settlement was extend ed throughout the district, there were 74 ; many of the number first mentioned had so remained from the first. It is not to be supposed that the Mirasi dars suffered these villages to continue under Amani for long series of years with the view to procure a reduction of a moderate assessment ; that would be giving the natives credit for a calculation of prospec tive advantage, in spite of present disadvantages, which forms no part of their character. It has been seen how a rise or fall in the price of grain at the time influenced their choice in the matter of a fixed money assessment as opposed to an assessment varia ble with the price of grain, for the future. There can be no doubt that Amani management was ruinous to the landholder, and it is a fact that lands in Amani villages were hardly saleable. 221. On a reference made by Mr. Ramayyangar on the subject of dealing with the survey excess in carrying out the extension of Mottamfaisal under the resolution passed by Government in 1859, the Board of Revenue recorded their views (276) as follows : \u2014 \" Para. 3. In Mr. Kindersley's settlements, gene rally founded on the returns of land in the survey which was made under his directions, the value of the increased quantity of land returned was not (276.)

To have augmented the demand by an invariable rule in proportion to the increased quantity of land returned by the survey, would have led to fallacious results, and held out expectations of revenue far beyond the capability of the district. The survey returns accordingly furnished a general guide, and the capability of each village was determined by a comparison of the average value per Valy with well ascertained averages of other villages similarly situated, with the value that the land bore in the market relatively with that of other villages, and with the results furnished from other sources of information which readily present themselves when personal enquiries are conducted on the spot. The Board of Revenue at that time seemed to think that a more definite rule, having special reference to the actual quantity of land returned by the survey, for estimating the capability of villages, might have been adopted ; but the further consideration of the question, as then discussed, may be properly post poned to the general survey. Meanwhile, it is sufficient to observe, that the measures then adopted for fixing the Mota fysal or aggregate settlement of villages, present the only course of proceeding open to the settlement officers at present engaged in bringing the remaining Olungu villages to the same stage as ordered by Government.\" Further on, the Board indicated the procedure to be followed by Mr. Ramayyangar thus, (p. 6) : \u2014 \" The accounts, from their nature, cannot shew what portion, if any, of the survey increase proceeds from bona fide increase of cultivation ; but the survey increase being added, in the first instance, for purposes of comparison, the capability thus obtained"], [692, "658 should be tested in the manner pursued by Mr. Kindersley, and the real capabihty of the village may be ascertained in this way with a sufficient approximation to truth for all practical purposes.\" On a visit which he paid to Tanjore at the beginning of 1860, Sir Charles Trevelyan, the then Governor, recorded his opinions) thus : \u2014 ' This is eminently a case for letting well alone. It would in every point of view be a mistake to unsettle such a happy settlement as that which has been arrived at in Tanjore. It would be killing the goose which lays the golden eggs.'

It was impossible to deny the force of these arguments. * * *\"(28D 224.

Under this system, every one of the Mirasidars knows what his own share of the village lands is and what the portion of the village assessment he is bound to pay, and no one therefore will ever pay more. At least, so far as the generality of the Mirasidars of the Cauvery delta are concerned, any oppression of the weaker by the stronger among them is impossible. \" The Tanjore Mirasidars,\" as observed by Mr. Wallace so early as 1805, \"are too independent of each other to submit to any over assessment by any of their own body,\" (see p. 32 ante). Neither does there appear to be any ground for the apprehension that the Mirasidars have con trived to put more than their proper proportion of assessment on inferior soils in order that they might relinquish them and retain superior lands with less than their proper share of the village assessment ; for in the Cauvery delta, the system of annually \" Giving up\" and \" Taking up\" is almost unknown. Indeed, no considerations of the pressure of assess ment will induce a Mirasidar here to part with any of his land. On the contrary, they take up and retain unprofitable land with the view to shut out Darkhas dars. 283) 225. Indeed, when the Mottamfaisal settlement was being extended under the orders of the Govern ment in 1859, the Board of Revenue strongly recom mended that it should be carried further to a detailed field assessment on the plan adopted by Mr. Kinders- (283.)

To stop short after settling the aggregate amount is ob viously undesirable on general grounds, apart from the embarrassment that different modes of settlement in the same district occasion. It was intended, when the survey and field assessment was ordered by Sir Thomas Munro, that the Olungu should give place to the Taram or fieldwar mode of settlement, through out the whole province. The work was carried far towards completion by Mr. Kindersley. Owing to a difference of opinion between that officer and the Board, as already observed in an early part of these proceedings, further progress was put a stop to for the time. Nothing has been done since that date till now, and it only remains that the taram or field war details should be ordered to be carried out in the villages now in progress of settlement as Motta fysal, as well as in those settled in that manner by Mr. Kindersley, or rather brought to that stage from Olungu preparatory to the distribution of the amount on fields. To this end the Mirasidars will be required to furnish the fieldwar details of the settlements as was done before, which may be veri fied by a small establishment for the purpose.

It has been seen (p. 221) that in their pro ceedings (1859) on the subject of dealing with the survey excess at the recent extension of Mottamfaisal, the Board of Revenue alluded to a future general survey. Indeed, the Government had shortly before, (1857), when disposing of an application from the Collector for certain concessions to the Tanjore Mira sidars, declined to enter into a consideration of the arguments adduced for an increase of Kudivaram for Nansei lands, pointing \" more particularly\" to the \" certainty\" that there was of Tanjore, in common with other districcs, being surveyed and re-assess ed^) This question of a survey and re-assess ment of this district, however, was, as shown above, decided in the negative by the Order of Government dated 4th April 1860.

Dry Wet. 228. Tbe\" present Jamabandi returns being pre pared according to a technical arrangement of com ponent items, it seems necessary to explain the nature of each. 229. The extent of land entered under the head \" dry\" includes dry cultivation converted into wet since the paimasbor survey of Fasli 1238 (A.D. 1828), but the amount entered as assessment under this head includes only the original dry rates. In tbese cases, down to Fasli 1267, tbe practice was to substitute the Nansei assessment calculated, in the field-assessed villages at the rate established for the corresponding class of Nansei lands, and in all other villages at the village average. Since that year, the rule has been introduced under the orders of Governments287-^ of charging, in addition to the exist ing dry assessment, a water-tax at the uniform rate of Rs. 12-8-0 per Veli, or Rs. 1-14-3 per acre, throughout the district. The difference between the dry and wet assessments charged down to Fasli 1267 and the water-rate charged since that date, con stitute the item \" Charge for water\" (Column 10). The charge is made only when Government water is used ; irrigation provided solely by private outlay, i.e., when it is not drawn from a source maintained or improved at the cost of Government, being exempt from all extra payment. Accordingly, garden cultivation under private wells is subject only to dry assessment and is included under the head \"dry.\" 230. The head \" wet\" is made up of irrigated paddy land, originally classed as Nansei, that is, land so entered in the paimash account, and also land under garden culture either by direct irrigation (287.) Dated let March 1858, No. 268."], [699, "665 Second crop as sessment. Charge for water Remissions. or with the aid of percolation from adjoining streams. This head includes, in some cases, also Manavari land, (i.e., land on which a crop of paddy is grown with the aid of falling rain alone) ; the original classification of such land as Nansei still remaining unaltered. 231. This is a charge for a second crop of paddy on Nansei or paddy land. This is called \" Fasaljasti,\" \" fasal\" signifying crop and \"jasti\" increase. In the case of land ordinarily yielding two crops the charge for the second crop is merged in the regular assessment. In all other cases it is levied only when a second crop is raised, and this head represents the separate charge thus made. When, in the case of land bearing a consolidated assessment for two crops, the second crop is not raised from want of water or other cause beyond the control of the occupant of the land, so much of the consolidated assessment as represents a charge for the second crop is remitted under the name of \" Fassal Kammi,\" \" Kammi \" signifying decrease. No charge is made for a dry crop raised as a second crop on paddy-fields with the aid merely of the moisture that is retained by the soil. Neither is any charge made for a second crop on garden land. The second crop charge, both where it is merged in the regular assessment and where it is made tem porarily, is a half of the assessment for the first crop. 232. This has been explained under the head \" dry.\" 233. A remission of the demand for loss sustain ed by the ryot is one of the essential features of the annual settlement of revenue under the Ryotwari system. The general principle is, that the ryot must bear all losses resulting from the ordinary"], [700, "666 vicissitudes of season, and that it is only in cases of extraordinary drought or inundation that relief is claimable. But an exception is made in the case of irrigated lands on the principle that, as the demand on such land includes the value of water which the Government provides, where the supply of water fails or proves so excessive as to prevent or destroy cultivation, the cultivator has always a right to ask for a remission on account of the resulting loss. It is of course only when the loss arises from causes beyond the control of the ryot, and not from any act or neglect of his, that relief is allowable. on irrigated lands. 234 The remission on irrigated lands, in ordi- nary seasons, is restricted, however, to absolute waste, i.e., land left wholly uncultivated, and to entire loss of crop on land cultivated ; in such cases, the whole demand on the particular field or fields is remitted. In districts in which the assessment has not been revised by the new Revenue Settlement De- partment upon the liberal principles which govern its operations ; the remission rules allow for the grant of a partial remission for partial loss of crops on irrigat- ed lands ; the measure of relief for the area irrigated by each irrigation work being determined at a general percentage with reference to the ascertained actual condition of a sufficient number of fields. In Tanjore, however, although a new settlement has not been introduced by the Settlement Department, this indulgence is not found necessary/288) The rules provide for the grant, in very exceptional years and under very exceptional circumstances, of a remission On unirrigated of assessment on unirrigated lands, at a general percentage for a given tract, calculated, as in the case last mentioned, with reference to its condition ascertained by the examination of a number of (288.)

This is the \" Fasalkammi\" remission referred Sessment\u00b0n to under the head of second crop assessment. 236. The amount of remission granted under each of the three ordinary heads above specified in Fasli 1285 was as shown below : \u2014 For Nansei or irrigated paddy land left waste (5,954 acres) Rs. 20,193 For Savi or crops wholly withered, on Nansei land , 51,199 \" Fasalkammi\" or second crop not cultivated ,, 510 Rs. 71,902 237. In Fasli 1285, there were no remissions on dry lands. The ordinary remission for total loss of crop on irrigated lands is divided into two sub heads, viz., loss by drought and loss by excess of water ; but there was no loss under the latter sub head in Fasli 1285. The year was characterized by deficiency of water, so much so indeed, that remission under this head amounted to Rs. 51,199 against Rs. 864 in the previous year. 238. Another remission usual in other districts, but which has ceased long since in Tanjore, is that allowed, under what are called kaul (cowle) rules, on waste land taken up for cultivation. In the case of unreclaimed land, in consideration of the cost of labour involved, in bringing it under the plough, the assessment on it is wholly remitted the first year; the second year only one-fourth is charged; the third year one-half ; the fourth year three-fourths, and it is in the fifth year that full assessment is levied ; the terms are sometimes varied. Theso"], [702, "668 Miscellaneous items favourable terms are technically called \" Cowle,\" which literally means engagement. In Tanjore no such terms are now allowed ; full assessment being invariably charged the first year on waste reclaimed. 239. These are numerous petty items, irrespec tive of the regular assessment on land under the head Ryotwar. The following is a statement of them : \u2014 1. Jodi on sundry Inams, Rs. 41,673. This is the quit-rent or light assessment charged on Inam or alienated lands in Government villages. The similar assessment on entire alienated villages forms a separate head of revenue. 2. Tax on trees on unassessed lands, Rs. 52,237. This is the tax on tops and detached trees (See p. 25, Chap. IL, Part III., paras. 88 and 203 of this Chapter). 3. Cess for repair of channels, Rs. 227. This is a voluntary contribution made by the Mirasidars of certain villages to meet the cost of an establish ment maintained to regulate the distribution of water from a common channel of irrigation. It is shown under this head for want of a more appro priate one. 4. Land cultivated but not included in the Jama bandi, Rs. 6,722. A casual item ; refers to land newly brought under cultivation, but omitted in the regular Jamabandi accounts by mistake or from its not having been brought to notice in time. 5. Concealed cultivation, Rs. 147. Needs no explanation. 6. Cultivation of Purampok lands, Rs. 9,410. A casual item ; refers to lands reserved for public or communal uses, but improperly cultivated or allowed, under particular circumstances, as in the"], [703, "669 case of dried-up tank beds, to be cultivated for one or two seasons. In either case the cultivation is temporary, and confers no right of occupancy, and the assessment is not included in the regular revenue on occupied area. 7. Rent of gardens and t6ps, Rs. 910. This refers to plantations, the sole property of Govern ment. 8. Revenue from reverted Inams, Es. 756. Refers to alienated lands of which the favourable tenure lapses to Government for want of heirs or other causes, under the terms of the grant. 9. Revenue from lands assessed at favourable rates, Rs. 4,334. Refers to lands alienated subject to the payment of more than the quit-rent or light assessment usually charged on Inams. 10. Chank rent, Rs. 241. This is the rent for which the exclusive privilege of Conch shell-fishery on the coast of the Palks Straits is farmed out. 11. Rent on dye roots, Rs. 100. This is the rent for the exclusive privilege of digging up the dye roots, called chay root, (Hedyotes Umbellata), which grow wild on the coast. 12. Tax on backyards in excess of the limit allowed, Rs. 4,832. Sites of houses and their backyards are exempt from land tax; a limit is fixed for the extent of land allowable as backyard to a house, and when land in excess of it is occupied as such, it is charged, and the assessment levied on it is credited to Miscellaneous Revenue. 13. Charge for water on Zamindari lands, Rs. 16,622. This is levied on lands not originally classed as wet, when they are irrigated from a 85"], [704, "670 Government source ; lands so classed being entitled to free irrigation. 14. Quit-rent on bungalows and gardens, Rs. 175. The only peculiarity of this item is that the rent is not liable to vary ; it is not lighter than the assessment on ordinary Ryotwari lands. 15. Rattan rent, Rs. 201. This is the rent for the exclusive privilege of cutting the rattans grow ing wild in low marshy spots near the coast. 16. Revenue processes Service fees, Rs. 22,131. This consists of fees levied on Revenue defaulters for the remuneration of persons employed to serve pro cesses on them. 17. Revenue deposits forfeited, Rs. 150. These are deposits made by renters of sundry farms as security for the rent payable by them. 18. Sale proceeds of Receipt and Patta books, Rs. 78. Pattas issued to Ryots under Ryotwar settlement and receipts granted for payments made by them are issued in the form of printed book, and the cost thereof is levied from them.

Its main divisions. Inam proper. PART IV. CHAPTER III. INAM AND ZAMINDARI TENURES. 1. As shown at the opening of the preceding chapter, the area wholly or partially exempt from the payment of revenue, under the general designa tion \" Inam,\" consists of 612,085, acres or a little more than one-fourth of the entire area of the district. In Tanjore, it is divisible under three main heads, to wit : (1) Inam proper, (2) Lands on which the revenue has been assigned in lieu of ready money allow ances to native religious institutions, and (3) Lands belonging to the private estate of the late Raja, known by the local designation \" Mdkasa.\" 2. The first is by far the most important head. All alienations under this head, excepting a few grants made by the British in the early part of this century^1) were made by the Mahratta rulers in the course of the last two centuries ; the great bulk by Rajas Pratapsing and Tulzaji between the years 1740 and 1 747. There are none which can be traced to the older native dynasties, viz., those of the Nayak and Cola Rajas, and it is probable that such grants of those dynasties as existed were resumed by the Mahrattas and converted (possibly not all) into grants of their own. (1.) These consist : (1) of the villages assigned to certain chattrums in lieu of resumed salt pans (see under salt monopoly in the following Chap ter) ; (2) of four villages granted as an endowment to a chattram at the request of Raja Carabhdji (see first item in the table at page 233 ante) , and (3) of lands of the annual value of Rs. 1,457 granted as protriam, SUD. ject to a quit rent of Rs. 800, for the support of a chattrum erected by R, Venkat Rao, a former Dewan of Travancore, at Koiladi, Tanjore Taluk, (G. 0. 28th June, 1836),"], [708, "674 Supported by Roy al grants. Nature of the grants. 3. In the majority of cases, royal grants in the shape of Sikha sanads(2) Daftar R6khas<3) and Arz R6khd,s(4) are forthcoming, and where such are wanting, the reason often assigned is, that the title deeds were lost in Hyder's invasion. As, how ever, Tanjore was, until it passed into British dom inion by treaty, under regular government with a recognized sovereign, none of the Inams in this pro vince are referrible as elsewhere to irregular aliena tions by Zamindars, Palayagars (Poligars) Renters and others, who, in other parts of the south, rose and usurped the power of government during the confu sion which prevailed during the period intermediate between the overthrow of native dynasties and the establishment of British supremacy. Neither have any instances come to notice of irregular alienations by Officers of Revenue or Karnams (accountants) as elsewhere. 4. Inams proper in Tanjore consist almost wholly of Endowments of Religious and charitable institu tions, and grants for the benefit of individuals, the latter chieflyBrahmans. Two other descriptions of alienations, common elsewhere, are those for the re muneration of service to the State or to village com munities, and those for the maintenance of tanks or other Irrigation works. Of the first description were the assignments of revenue for the remuneration of Karnams (village accountants), of Kavalgars (the rural constabulary) and in some few cases of Talayars (village watchers) ; but the assignment to Karnams, the annual value of which was Rs. 1,08,429, were made by the British Government in 1807, and were re- (2.)

(6> The few Talayari inams which likewise had their origin presumably during the days of the native Government, were more recently enfranchised by the Inam Commissioner at a quit-rent equal to five eights of the regular assessment.'7) There are thus no inams now held for service to the State or to com munities. Of inams for repair of Irrigation tanks, there are just 4 acres charged with the payment of a quit-rent of one rupee to a Zamindar. 5.

The rate of charge, established about the same time for Ryotwari or unalienated lands converted from dry into wet, viz. Rs. 12-8-0 per Veli, or Rs. 1-4-3 per acre, was applied also to Inam lands similarly converted. As in many cases the deeds of grant were not forthcoming, and as it was otherwise diffi cult to ascertain what lands were irrigated and what were not when granted, it was decided that the Paimash Registers of 1828 should be adopted as the index to the normal condition of inams; this document being about coeval with the con struction of the Coleroon anikats and other large works of Irrigation which afforded the means for the extension of irrigated cultivation generally in Tanjore. The amount of charge levied under this head in fasli 1285 was Rs. 16,662 on an area of 10,030 acres(10) , which represents the whole extent of inams converted from dry into wet cultivation since fasli 1238. It is easy to account for the extent of such cultivation being so small. In the delta, the great bulk of Inam area is normally wet, and there is very little scope, therefore, for any increase of wet cultivation. In the upland portion of the district, on the other hand, each Inam village has its own tank. 10.

An arrangement of this nature was called for only in the southern part of Tanjore inhabited by lawless tribes and exposed to the raids of similar tribes, viz., Maravars and Kallars, from further south.

Under the Mahratta Government, the chief Sources from which j. , , , , , , the Native Govern source ot revenue, next to land, was the duty on the ment drew a revenue. transit of goods, known in subsequent times by the denomination \" Say er.\" The Sea Customs revenue was comparatively insignificant. Of salt there is no mention in the Commissioners' Report or the reports of the first Collector, Mr. Harris, owing apparently to the fact that the salt pans within the Raja's terri tories had all, or almost all, been assigned to native religious and charitable institutions and had ceased to contribute any revenue to the State Exchequer. Petty taxes on arts, professions, &c, were numerous; but their yield in the aggregate was small. Each general head indicated will be noticed in order. 2. \" The rates of Customs (Inland) throughout the Sayer or Tran5it country,\" the Commissioners say, \" have been estab lished in the memory of the oldest inhabitants beyond any period they can calculate on.\"**1) These were levied at fixed posts and at fixed rates, on all mer chandise and provisions; the rates varied, however, for the different commodities and also with the distance traversed. The Chaukies (Chokies) or Customs Posts seem to have been numerous. The duties were rented out annually in five farms conterminous with the five Sub'has, and the renter of each Sub'ha sublet his farm in smaller divisions to under-renters. The total revenue under this head, for Fash 1205 (A. D. 1795-6), exclusive of the Inlaid Customs (1.) Their Report, Appendix pago 20. 87"], [720, "686 collected at seaport towns, which is included in the Sea Customs revenue, was Rs. 2,55,267 ;<2> but this amount seems to be small compared with what it used to be before this. \" We learn,\" the Commis- sioners say, \"that in Tuljagee's time, the customs for the Trivady Soubah including Tan j our amounted to upwards of a lack of Chuckrams (Rs. 1,55,556) annually, which is more than half of the amount of customs now drawn from the whole Province.\" <3) Its falling off in recent years is explained by them thus : \u2014 \"Two causes enable us to account for this defi ciency; since Tanjour and Vellum have become mili tary stations, many articles are exempt from customs on the plea of being necessary for the corns ort of the troops, which, opening a new source of abuse and being now long practiced, has operated seriously to the detriment of the revenue ; the second and most material cause is the great decrease in opulence com pared with the former condition of Tanjour, when the height of luxury created wants now no longer felt and operated as a stimulus on manufactures and inland commerce. To these causes we may also add Ameersing's remissions of half customs on all cooly loads, which was made on the representation of the inhabitants ; but as this is the first instance of the rates of customs being changed, which, during the former prosperity of the country and even during the calamities of the war, were never considered grievous, the Raja's ready compliance in this parti cular instance rather evinces the superior influence of his subjects than the necessity of any reform.\" 3. The duties from their nature cannot but have been vexatious and repressive of trade; but from (2.) Statement No. 6 accompanying the Commissioners' Report. (3.) Commissioners' Report, Appendix page 18."], [721, "687 the Commissioners' Report, it appears, they were not rendered particularly odious by the manner in which they were levied. From the table, appended to their report, of the rates of duty for the Tiruvadi Sub'ha which included the capital of the principality, it is inferrible that the same article was not subjected to duty in its transit more than once, and that complaints of exaction or undue detention were duly attended to. The Commissioners say, \" the rates of customs are levied on general principles in respect to the different classes of inhabitants, W and being well defined, are not objected to as oppressive or vexatious. A registration of these rates is kept at every customs house, open for public information, and in the event of exaction by the under-renters, the merchant deposits his goods at the custom house, and applies to the head renter of the Soubah for redress, who either fines or dismisses the delinquent, as the case may require. When any new customs are imposed for special or temporary purposes, such as public cere monies, religious purposes or marriages, &c, the merchants are assembled and made acquainted with the particular alteration, which is soon generally known in so small a Province. But when instances happen of the merchant being ignorant of any new tax, on representation to the head renters, he is sometimes allowed a remission, or only half customs is collected ; but this seems to depend greatly on the pleasure or compassion of the head renters, from whose decision an appeal may however be made to the Rajah.\" Mr. Harris, however, who was one of the Commissioners from whose report the foregoing pas sages have been quoted, writing as Collector at a later (4.) This probably is a clerical error. There is nothing in the table of rates to show that a distinction was made between the different classes of the people."], [722, "688 Sea Customs, Salt, date, describes the administration of this branch of the revenue by the native government, as indeed he does every other system of that government, as ex ceedingly bad. \" It would require,\" he says, \" much time and great labour to describe effectually the abuses and irregularities that prevailed during the Mahratta Government in the SajTer Department. \"(5) 4. The principal sea-ports of the Province, viz., Negapatam, Nagur, Kareikkal and Tranquebar, be longed to European settlements, and the revenue of most of the other ports had been assigned to native religious and charitable institutions ; so that the amount actually received by the native government from this source was very small. For Fasli 1205, the Raja's revenue from sea-ports, including also the inland customs collected in those localities, was Rs. 3,467. The rates of duty, however, appear to have been high and undefined ; sometimes as much as 12 per cent.W 5. There was no State monopoly on salt. As before stated, the salt pans had all, or almost all, been assigned to native religious and charitable in stitutions, the managers of which divided the pro duce with the Mirasi manufacturers/7) giving them a share as Kudivaram as in the case of grain lands. This latter arrangement, of course, did not apply to the great Vedaranyam swamp (8) and as there was no occupancy right therein, the managers of the Veda ranyam temple, which was the assignee of its revenue, collected the whole produce and disposed of it to the best advantage. (5.) Mr. Harris' letter to the Board, 27th October 1802. (Q.) Board's General Report, 25th February 1307, p. 227. (7.)

Most of the items being lumped up together the rate or product of each tax is not separately ascertain able. Besides those here specified, small imposts on arts and callings and contributions for festivals, as shown in table E. appended to p. 21 of Chap. II of this part, were levied also ; but they are likewise lumped up with various minor items of land-revenue. It will be seen from that table which refers to the Mannargudi Sub'ha, that a tax on looms does not find a place in it, and that the house-tax in that Sub'ha was confined to strangers not engaged in agriculture. On the whole it appears, that these miscellaneous imposts were not generally levied, and judging from the figures, they were not heavy. 7. Under the British Government, with the steady progress of population and wealth and with a moderate land tax, the sources of revenue other than land have become very materially developed. As the administration of these is governed by legislation, and is conducted on the same plan and by the same machinery throughout the Presidency, a brief his torical sketch of each seems to be all that is required. 8. Under this head were included all duties levied on internal land trade, whether in the shape of Tran sit or Town duties, as also those levied on the sale of tobacco and betel. The customs levied on foreign frontier were likewise included under this head. Dur ing the earlier years of the British rule, the \" Sayer\" was, as during the days of native Government, the most productive of all sources of revenue other than land. In fasli 1210 (A. D. 1800-1), the first year of the British assumption of the Province, the Sayer revenue, with a few modifications and exemp tions, was rented out, and the amount realised was"], [725, "691 Rs. 1,86,461.(9) In Fasli 1211 , all duty on grain was abolished/10) and the Sayer rent realised on other goods was Rs. 85,585. InFash '212, on Mr. Harris' recommendation, the whole Sayer was abolished/11) In the following year (Fasli 1213), however, it was re-introduced in the form of Town duties, which then superseded the Sayer in the greater part of the Presidency/12) Grain continued to be exempt in Tanjore, and in Fash 1215, on the introduction of the Salt monopoly, that commodity became exempt from Sayer throughout the Presidency. In Fasli 1216, the Town duties were abolished, except as re garded tobacco and betel, the sale of which was sub jected to duty under licenses ;(13) but this latter was soon after suspended on account of the distress which prevailed throughout the peninsula from drought. In Fasli 1218, the Town duties, except in the case of grain and salt, were re-introduced simultaneously with the tax on the sale of to bacco and betel ; but in both cases the impost was restricted to principal towns. An important modification was made also in the system of levying the duty by exempting goods which once paid a duty from all further demand on account of land or sea customs. (14) In fasli 1219, the grain duty was re vived/15) but was suspended at the request of the Mirasidars on the introduction of the quinquennial lease of Land revenue, in the following year.(16) (9.) The amount for which the Sayer was rented, is given in Mr. Harris' letter as 41,737 star pagodas, or Rs. 1,46,080; but presumably this amount does not include the European possessions. (10.)

From this period, the general transit duty, as also the duty on the sale of tobacco, with modifications of form and detail, was maintained down to 1844, when both were abolished by Act Vi of 1844, with great relief to trade and benefit to the country, throughout the Bri tish territories subject to the Presidency of Madras except Canara, Malabar and Coimbatore/18) During the period this branch of revenue was maintained, the collections fluctuated, as will be seen from the general table given at the close of this chapter, from Rs. 85,585 in fasli 1211 to Rs. 4,31,849 in fasli 1238 ; the years in which there was a total or almost total suspension of the Sayer being excluded. 9. When the Sayer was abolished, trade with foreign settlements by land was placed on the same footing as trade with foreign Ports by sea, and was regulated by the same Tariff. Accordingly, the customs duties levied on the frontier of the French Settlement of Kariekkal constitute the Land Customs revenue of Tanjore at present. The convention with the French concedes a free tran- sport of grain to the extent required for consump tion within the French settlement, and, under arrangements subsequently agreed to, all grain passing thereinto goes free in the first instance, the French authorities collecting and paying over the duty on so much of it as is exported by sea.

While on the whole the gradual rise of this branch of the public revenue is due mainly to the progressive development of trade and the resources of the country generally, its fluctuations from time to time are traceable in part also to the variations of the Tariff rates and administrative changes.

On the east coast, the brine supply is gene rally obtained from wells or pits dug for the pur pose. It sometimes fails in the hot season, when tidal creeks or canals that adjoin are drawn upon ; generally, however, the supply of sub-soil brine is found sufficient. On the south coast, the brine supply, which is drawn direct from the sea (the salt works being either on, or slightly below, the sea level), is abundant. The normal density of the brine is everywhere sufficiently high. In a table appended to his report, Dr. Ratton gives it in degrees of Beaume's hydrome ter thus : \u2014 Neidavasal ... 9\u00b0 Tranquebar ... 8\u00b0 Negapatam ... 9\u00b0 Vedarannyam ... 18\u00b0 Tambikkinallavankottei ... 5\u00b0 Ativiraramanpattanam ... 5\u00b0 Kattumavadi ... 3\u00b0 Arasanagari ... 3\u00b0 As observed by the late Madras Commission, however, in the case of pit brine, much depends upon the time of the year when its density is tested. Vedarannyam, where Dr. Ratton found the pit brine as strong as 18\u00b0 Beaume, was visited by him at the end of May. As to purity, the pit brine at Negapatam has been strongly condemned. Dr. Ratton describes it as \" scanty (this was in March), very dirty, sometimes of a pea-soap colour or red from the presence of innumerable monads, often green and opaque, filled with zoospores and sometimes exhaling an offensive odour, the result of their decomposition.\" These observations have been generally confirmed by the"], [735, "701 late Salt Commission, on an inspection of the works at this station. Apparently, no exception has been taken to the quality or composition of the brine supply at other localities in this district. 19.

Of these latter he says : \u2014 \" The soil upon which the pans rest is a coarse silt, thickly interspersed with marine shells \u2014 most unpromising material for the formation of im pregnable bed floors. There is no clay about the locality except that in the shore now rising, nor could we find any in the sub-soil examined to a depth of six feet.\" He describes the soil on which the pans at Tambikkinallavank6ttei and Ativiraraman pattanam rest to be \" excellent clay.\" 20.

At the two factories excepted, the salt beds being on a level with the sea, the seawater flows into them by force of gravity. At Neidavasal, Tambikkinallavankdttei and Ativira ramanpattanam, each row of crystalising beds has by its side a row of condensing beds,(27) from which the brine, when it has reached a certain degree of density, is let, bed to bed, into the former, whence the salt, (27) At Neidavasal, for every two rows of crystalising, there is one of condensing beds. 89"], [736, "702 Season of manu facture. when crystalised, is scraped. The condensing are called the male and the crystalizing the female beds. At Tranquebar, the function of condensers is per formed by a common reservoir for a number of crystalizing beds. At Kattumavadi and Arasana gari, the reservoir surrounds the salt beds in the form of a ditch ; it is usually narrow and deep. At Negapatam and Vedarannyam, there are neither con densers nor reservoirs ; the brine drawn from the well passing by the feeding channel direct into the salt beds. 21. Generally there is but one irrigation for each crop of salt ; sometimes two. The depth of irriga tion varies from 1 to 1^ inches at Negapatam, to 2 to 3 inches at the southern factories. The interval of time between two scrapings of salt, in ordinary dry weather, varies from three to seven days. The salt, when scraped, is placed on a ridge in the corner of the bed, or on the bank which divides the beds, where it is left to drain for a day or two, and is then removed to some vacant spot nearest to the pans, where each manufacturer's salt is collected into a heap. Here it lies until its delivery into stores, which generally takes place after the lapse of a month. 22. Preparations for manufacture commence generally in January, and occupy about a month or six weeks, during which the brine pits and feeding channels, as also condensing reservoirs where they are maintained, are cleared . the repairs of embank ments as well as the levelling, puddling, and stamp ing of salt beds, is also attended to. The manufac ture begins in February and continues more or less until October, when the rains of the north-east Mon soon generally set in. The ordinary duration of"], [737, "703 Composition and quality of Salt. actual manufacture may be taken, therefore, to comprise eight months. The mode of manufacture is, as everywhere else in the Presidency, of a primitive nature, and its shortcomings are much the same as those which the late Salt Commission place, as regards the Presidency generally, under three general heads, thus : \u2014 (1.) \" The brine is admitted to the crystalising beds at too low a density. (2.) The irrigations are too shallow, and, (3.) There is no arrangement for the thorough elimination of the bitterns left after the first preci pitation of sodium chloride.\" 23. The Salt Commission had specimens of salt, taken from five different dep6ts in this district, com pletely analysed, and those of bazaar salt obtained from four towns tested by an incomplete analysis with the view to ascertain roughly the purity or otherwise of the salt as it entered into consumption. The result is exhibited in the following tables, A and B, extracted from those appended to their report. [Statement."], [738, "704 A. Analysis of specimens of salt from salt-works and salt-stores.

They observe: \u2014 \"It is, however, unsafe to build on a single analy sis of any salt. * * *. A sample sent may not be really representative, or it may not be homogeneous, and the portion selected for analysis may therefore not fairly represent the sample. In respect of moisture especially, much depends on the date of the analysis and the hydrometrical state of the air at the time. 25. The Government Salt Dep6ts are all on the storage coast and, except in the case of Negapatam, close to the factories. The salt is stored in heaps of 10 Garce (1200 Indian Maunds) on rectangular earthen plat forms raised three or four feet above the ordinary level of water in the rains. The platform is general ly surrounded by a ditch, and has over its gate a watch-tower commanding a view of the whole storage ground.

At all other factories, including even Nega patam, where the distance from the pans to the sto rage platforms is from about a half to two miles by the boat canal, the carriage, as well as the laying and covering of heaps, devolve on the manufacturers. The salt is both received into store and sold to the public by weight ; but it is everywhere retailed by merchants by measure. 26. The salt manufacturers in Taniore, except in those cases of newly opened factories, where, in default of village Mira.sda.rs, strangers have been engaged to work them, are the representatives, by inheritance, purchase or otherwise, of the parties who were in Mirasi or proprietary occupancy at the date of the introduction of the monopoly, and their status in relation to the pans previously was the same as that of Mirasi cultivators of lands appropria- ted to agriculture. In regard to manufacturers of this status, Regulation I. of 1805 provides (section 4.), that their share in the produce shall be paid at the same rates as formerly obtained, but converted into money at the average selling price of salt at the pans cultivated in the five years preceding the date of the Regulation. When new factories are opened, the village Mirasdars are given the first refusal as in the case of lands granted on Ryotwar pattas, and it is only when they refuse or neglect, that strangers are engaged. No distinction is made, how ever, between these two classes of salt ryots as regards (28.) See Part I. Chap. I. p. 9."], [741, "707 Hates of Kudivaram Kudivaram, and a transferable property in the pans is recognised in both cases alike. 27. The quantity of salt to be made is regulated by the officers of Government, who, under the monopoly Regulation (sec. 5, clause 1), may limit the manufacture or close the pans altogether. If the tenant proprietor refuses or neglects to make salt as required, he is liable to forfeit all his rights to the pans. (Sec. 6 and also Regulation 5 of 1831, section 2) The Regulation provides (sec. 5) for the payment of compensation for pans closed ; but none has been ever paid or claimed in Tanjore in such cases. When new pans are opened, those engaged to work them are expressly given to understand that the Government may close them at any time without compensation. 28. It does not appear what the rates of Kudi varam fixed under sec. 4 of Regulation I of 1805, on the first establishment of the monopoly, were. In 1854, an uniform rate of Rs 10 per Garce prevailed throughout the district. In 1856, when 424 Mad ras marakkals were substituted for 400 as the equi valent of a Garce\u2014 =120 maunds \u2014 (at this time the practice of both receiving and selling at Govern ment dep6ts by measure continued) ; the kudivaram was raised to Rs. 10-10-0 per Garce, at which rate it stands now, except at Neidavasal, Tranquebar and Negapatam. At the two first mentioned of these factories, it has been since raised to Rs. 11-4-0, and at Negapatam to Rs. 15, in consideration of the increased wages of labour.

The foregoing observations refer to salt manufactured in factories by the usual method ; but Tanjore has an important source of supply in the large swamp near Point Calimeer, known as the great Vedarannyam swamp, in which is produced salt of a superior quality known as the Veda rannyam spontaneous salt. Of this swamp and the manner in which salt is produced in it, a brief account has been given in the opening chapter of the first part. It is filled by the periodical sea floods \" Cittra parvam \" and \" Viqdkha vellam \" in the months of May and June, and the salt is formed to complete crystalization in July or August. The crop, almost unlimited in quantity as it is when formed, is nevertheless precarious, being liable to be destroyed or greatly stinted, if heavy or repeated falls of rain occur while it is forming. Accordingly, the outturn used to vary very considerably from year to year, and sometimes to be nil. Latterly 90"], [744, "710 owing to the cessation of exports and the difficulty its exceptional weight offers to its disposal for inland consumption at the uniform price fixed by law, the gathering of this salt has been discontinued.

The cost of collecting and storing the salt was formerly about Rs. 3 per garce (about 4\u00a3 tons); but now owing to the increased wages of labour, it comes to about Rs. 5. 31. The spontaneous salt, in the words of Dr. Ratton, \" is excellent salt, clean, hard, heavy , well knit together and very pure, containing 96*7 per cent. of sodic chloride.\" It is formed in such large blocks, that, during the days of the Raja's [Government, it was usual to have them moulded into figures of ele phants, horses, and the like, and to send them to the Court as presents. Notwithstanding its superior quality, however, it labours under a great commer-"], [745, "711 Vedarannyam manufactured salt. Area supplied by Tanjore Salt Works. cial disadvantage. Merchants everywhere sell salt by measure, and buying at the Government depot by weight, they cannot, owing to its exceptional weight, sell this salt at the same price, bulk for bulk, as the ordinary salt. The consumers, on the other hand, caring only for bulk, will not give more for this than the ordinary salt. 32. This locality became a place of manufacture i j by the ordinary method for the first time in 1863, when, in order to meet the growing demand of the ' Railway trade, and in view of the precarious nature of the spontaneous produce of the swamp, as well as of the difficulty in selling it as above mentioned, a portion of the swamp was reclaimed and laid out in regular beds in which salt is made from brine drawn from pits dug for the purpose, supplemented occasionally by the seawater of the Vicakha-vellam. The salt made goes entirely to supplement the stores at Negapatam, to which it is carried by the boat canal directly from the beds. The statistics given in the preceding pages under the head \" Vedarannyam pans\" all refer to this manufactured salt. The manufacturers receive Kudivaram at the rate which obtains in the southern stations, viz., Rs., 10-10-0 per garce, which, with the carriage to Negapatam (Rs. 7) borne by Government, makes up Rs. 17-10-0 per garce or 2 annas and 4'2 pies per Indian maund. The salt is transported, however, at the risk of the manufacturers, and it is on the quantity delivered on the Negapatam platform that they receive their Kudivaram. 33. The area supplied by the salt works of this- District consists, besides the whole of Tanjore, of the greater part of the District of Trichinopoly and the native State of Pudukottei, as also of parts of Madura, Coimbatore, Salem ancl South Arcot.

Since the open ing of the Railway from Negapatam, however, it is supplied chiefly from that station. Neidavasal, the northernmost factory in Tanjore, supplies the furthest south of South Arcot, and the northern and eastern ends of Trichinopoly. 34. The sales of salt are recorded under four different heads, to wit : \u2014 (1.) Home consumption, (2.) Inland consumption, (3.) Exportation by sea, and (4.) Supply to the French Government. The first signifies consumption within the District, and the second consumption beyond its limits, and these two heads are alone of importance, since they alone make up the Salt Revenue properly so called. The entries severally under these two heads, however, are based solely on merchants' declarations which are utterly untrustworthy, and no means exist, therefore, for ascertaining exactly how much of the salt bought by inland traders is consumed within the District and how much passes beyond its limits. The quan tities carried by rail, which alone are ascertainable, have been shown in chapter X of Part II ; but those carried by carts into the Trichinopoly District, the State of Pudukottei and part of South Arcot are unknown, and altogether, it is impossible to calculate the rate of consumption within the District.

Under the Indian fiscal system, salt exported by sea to places beyond British India is not taxed; but the condition recently introduced that the exporter should pay the prescribed duty in the first instance, and obtain a refund of it on production of proof that it was landed out of British India, has practically put an end to the export trade in salt. Formerly, it used to be exported generally to the Straits Settle ments, and in vessels bringing cargo of other goods from that direction. It was generally the Vedar annyam spontaneous salt that was supplied, as well as preferred on account of its superior quality, for export. 36.

The French Government is bound to sell the salt thus obtained at \" nearly the same price as that at which it shall be sold by the British Government in the vicinity 0f * * * Prench possessions,\" and it further receives from the British, as an idemnity for the loss of its revenue from salt as regards all the French settlements in India, the sum of Rs. 4,41,600 annually. 37. The revenue under this head is derived from a tax on the sale of country spirits and toddy or fermented palm-juice. The only spirituous liquor distilled and sold in Tanjore is a kind of rum, generally called arrack, made from palmyra jaggery imported chiefly from Tinnevelly; the bark of Acacia lencophl\u0153a, (Tamil Velvela) which gives it the more specific name \" pattei arrack \" in clistinc-"], [749, "715 tion from Colombo arrack distilled from palm-juice, being used only to preserve flavour and to prevent decomposition of the solution. Toddy is consumed wholly in its natural fermented state, and is not used for the distillation of spirit. It is drawn chiefly from cocoanut trees with which the Cauvery delta, as likewise the coast of Palk's Strait, abounds. 38. It does not appear that the native Govern- Revenue realised . by the native Govern ment drew any revenue from arrack. An item of ment. 700 chakrams (Rs. 1,088) appears as \" Toddy rent\" in the statement of revenues and charges for fasli 1203 (A. D. 1793-94), forwarded with the Com missioners' Report. Arrack did not forma source of revenue in the English settlements either ; (29) it appears, however, in connection with the French Settlement of Kareikkal, which remained in the occupation of the English for many years at the latter end of the last, and the early part of the present century. Apparently the abkarry system was introduced into Tanjore only after it became wholly a British province. 39.

The first Abkarry law of the Madras Presi lation in relation to \" \u2022 this branch of the dency (the Madras town excepted) was Regulation I of 1808, which provided for farming the exclusive privilege of manufacturing and selling country spirits as well as that of selling foreign spirits. The monopoly created by the enactment did not extend to toddy, which was nevertheless included in the farm. The defects of this enactment, which experience brought to light, were corrected, twelve years later, by another (Regulation I of 1820), by which it was repealed. This latter Regulation brought toddy and other fermented liquors under regular monopoly, and provided for the monopoly being either rented out or worked under direct management by the officers of Government ; it also gave renters power to sub-rent and to proceed against the sub-renters for the recovery of their dues in the manner provided for the recovery of land revenue by land holders from their tenants. This enactment regulated the abkarry revenue until 1863. It left, however, a loop-hole for foreign im ported wines and beer to escape by, in that the term used with respect to imported liquor was spirits. A ruling of the late Sadar Court, which pointed out this defect, led to a revision of the law, with other amendments, the most significant of which are the powers taken to levy an excise duty on the quantity of arrack manufactured, in place of farming the exclusive privilege of manufacture and sale, and to suppress the home manufacture of toddy, hitherto free. The result is Madras Act III of 1864. By a subsequent Act, V of 1879, power has been taken to prohibit the sub-renting of farms by renters in any tracts, and the provisions for the suppression of illicit practices rendered more efficient in detail."], [751, "717 41. This branch of the revenue has, as might Re^_feess os the be expected, progressed pari passu with the ad- vancing prosperity of the country. For the first eight years, during which it was unguarded by legislation, the collections averaged Rs. 17,568. For the succeeding twelve years (Faslis 1218 \u2014 1229), during which the earliest Abkarry law (Reg. I of 1808) was in force, they averaged Rs. 31,355. For the next thirty six years down to Fasli 1265, they averaged Rs. 70,239. In Fasli 1266 was in augurated the present enlightened policy with respect to the revenue demand on land, and from that year dates the era of agricultural prosperity and with it the rapid advance of the Abkarry revenue. For the twenty years from Fash 1266 to 1285, the collections give an average of Rs. 3,86,966. The highest point reached was in Fasli 1279 (1869-70), when they came up to 5,68,586. Now, reckless specu lation in bidding for Abkarry Contracts ended in failures, attended in some cases with the ruin of the contractors. The revenue accordingly fell off in 1280 to Rs. 5,10,703 ; in Fasli 1283 to Rs. 4,89,057 ; and in Fasli 1287, the second year of the famine, it was as low as Rs. 4,12,993. 42. Up to Fasli 1284(A.

In fasli 1285, toddy was separated from arrack, and the present combined system of assign ed monopoly and excise was introduced in regard to the latter.

The duty on issues of liquor is paid quarterly. The con tractor is bound to sell liquor at regulated strengths and at prices between certain maximum and minimum limits. He also undertakes to pay for guards and gauging establishments maintained by Government at the distilleries. 43. The guaranteed minimum of annual revenue for the three years, faslis 1285 to 1287, was Rs. 1,80,000 ; but in consideration of the material fall ing off in consumption during the famine, as evi denced by actual issues in the first year of the con tract, the guarantee was dispensed with, and the contractors' obligation was restricted to payment on actual issues.

In Fasli 1285, 16 wholesale and 15 retail licenses were issued and the total fee collected was Rs. 625. 48. This form of taxation was unknown in this District before the British rule, and was introduced first in 1808(32> by legislation governing the Stamp Revenue throughout the Madras Presidency. The Stamp Law has undergone revisions from time to time.(33> Until 1869 no distinction was made between proceedings in Courts of law and private documentary transactions. Since that year, the two heads have been separated; the former being go verned by the Court Fees Act (VII of 1870) and the latter by the General Stamp Act XVIII of 1869, since superseded by Act I of 1879. On all proceed ings in Courts of law, duty must be paid by ad hesive labels attached to petitions or pleadings be fore they can be received or accepted. All private documents, except in certain cases where the use of adhesive labels is permitted, must be drawn up on paper impressed with stamps denoting appropriate values. 49. The Stamp revenue in the first full year of its operation (Fasli 1219) was Rs. 36,655.

The increase of revenue under this head is due of course mainly to the enhancement of the rates of duty, as well as the enlargement of the range of taxation ; but it is the result, in no small degree, also of the growing prosperity of the country (32.)

The second marked increase of taxation was by Act XXVI of 1867, which enhanced the scale of institution fee on suits, when it rose from Rs. 3,46,064 in Fasli 1276 to Rs. 4,73,755 in Fasli 1278, the full year of its operation. 50.

It was revived on 1st April 1869 and was discontinued on 31st March 1872.

In this Act, the Schedule of rates leaves out Rs. 200, (the lowest rate being charged on profits of more than Rs. 200 and less than Rs. 500), whereas in Act XXI of 1867, it began from Rs. 200. The Schedule differs also in the adjust- ment of rates to the scale of profits. (34) 51. It will be seen that the largest amount collected was Rs. 2,41,111 in 1870-71 under Act XVI of 1870 ; the reason being that that enactment did not exempt agricultural profits. The Income Tax of 1860, notwithstanding that it imposed higher rates, was less productive, because it exempted all occupants of land, who paid less than Rs. 600 yearly to Government or to any other superior land-lord. This exemption was based on the presumption that the ryot's net profit did not exceed one-third of his payments, and accordingly the Act provided that, in the case of lands held under direct engagements with Government, this proportion should be taken as the ryot's income for the purpose of the Income Tax assessment ; while in point of fact, the ryot's net profit, as a rule, exceeded his payments to Govern ment. The result was, that while the great bulk of land-holders were exempted, (those paying Rs. 600 and upwards being comparatively very few), those taxed were assessed at a considerably low rate relatively to their actual profits. 52. The heads of revenue which remain to be Moturpho. noticed are the house tax and loom tax, both of which, however, have been discontinued. They (34) Since this compilation was sent to Press, the limit of exemption has been extended by Govt. of India Act VI of 1880 to all profits below Rs 500, and by Madras Act III of 1880, the Schedule of rates has been recast, whereby the rates for the several classes have been reduced, the highest being Ra, 500 instead of Rs. 800 under the previous Aot. 92"], [760, "726 House Tax, constituted in Tanjore the whole ofthe \"Moturpha\" (now extinct), which elsewhere was of considerable importance, comprising taxes on Arts and Profession. 53. During the days of the native Government, it has been seen, the house tax was only partially levied? and where levied, was restricted presumably to non-agriculturists. The amount levied is not ascer- tainable. Soon after the cession of the province, Mr. Harris, the first Collector, proposed that* a tax on houses, the probable proceeds of which at the rates proposed by him, he estimated at 36,894 Star Pagodas (Rs 1,29,123), should be substituted for the Sayer or Transit duties/35) The Government, however, reserved their orders on this proposal, but acceded to Mr. Harris' urgent recommendation to abolish the Sayer, (36) It does not appear that any orders were passed afterwards on the scheme of house tax ; but presumably such small tax as was levied by the native Government was maintained, with perhaps some additions and modifications, until it was regulated and declared to be appropriable to the rural Police by the first Police Regulation (I of 1816 of the Madras Code). This enactment provid- ed for a revision, from time to time, of the rates of the tax within a maximum of 5 per cent, of the rent value ; but no revision . ever afterwards took place, and the tax continued to be collected at the very low rates(37) specified in the said Regulation, until it was abolished, on the introduction of an Income Tax. The amount of house tax collected up to fasli 1242 (1832-33) is not ascertainable, owing probably to its being merged in the Police fund till then dealt with as a head of Deposit Account. In fasli 1243, it was (35) Letter, 21st October 1802. (36) From Government to Board, 31st idem.

This tax seems to have been more generally Loom Tax levied during the days of the native Government ; but it was in many cases assigned to Native Reli gious institutions. After the British assumption of the province, the tax was maintained, without any legislative sanction, until fasli 1270, when it was discontinued, in hke manner with and for the same reason as, the house tax. Looms were broadly classed with reference to the estimated value of the piece wrought at one time, and a rate was levied on each class. There were three rates in all, viz., annas 15, Rs. 1-14-0 and* 2s. 3-12-0. The amount collected in fasli 1210(1800-01), the first year of the British rule, was Rs. 10,212. In the course of fifty-two years, during which, this tax was main tained, it ranged from Rs. 5,825 in fasli 1215 to Rs. 20,194 in 1260.

Tanjore was, until itbecame part of the British Division into three dominion, a distinct Hindu principality, and its poli- dynasties* tical history is divisible into three parts, viz : (1) The Cola dynasty, (2) The Nayak dynasty, and (3) The Mahratta dynasty. 2. The commencement ofthe Cola* dynasty was more or less coeval with the Aryan civilization of the south, and is traceable to a date anterior to the second century B. C. It was founded by a Turanian Chief of the name of Cola, which afterwards became the titular name of the dynasty. It lasted until the early part of the sixteenth century A. D., and during the period of at least seventeen centuries over which it thus extended, the extent of its dominion varied con siderably. At the commencement, it was probably a small Chief ship ; but latterly, from the eighth or ninth century A. D., it rose very considerably in power and extended its domain far and wide.

At the date last mentioned, Tanjore was seized by the Nayak ruler of the adjoining principality of Madura, who, however, was soon after (about the year 1674) ejected by Ekoji, half-brother of Civaji (Sivajee), the founder of the Mahratta empire. This last mentioned Chief came out in the capacity of a General of the Pathan Government of Bijapur in the Dakhan, in aid of the Tanjore Nayak, but made the conquest his own ; the Pathan Government which was then on the verge of extinction and was subse quently absorbed into the Moghal territory under the grasping Emperor, Aurungzebe, not having been in a position to resent this transgression of its servant. At the end of the seventeenth century, when the southern conquests of the Pathan rulers of Bijapur and Golkonda were brought more or less under the Moghal dominion, the Tanjore principality became nominally a tributary of it ; but in the unsettled times which followed, the acknowledgment by the Mahratta Rajas of their vassalage to any suzerain power amounted to little more than a submission to occasional pecuniary demands of Military Governors and pseudo Navabs when accompanied by the over-: whelming force of an army. This was the position of the Mahratta Rajas until the establishment of the power of Navab Muhammad Ali, with the aid of the British arms, over the Karnatak, about the year 1761 ; when they became defacto tributaries of the Navab and soon after of the English as assignees o^ his tribute.

All, therefore, that can be attempted, with regard to the ancient history of Tanjore, is a general out line and, so far as the available materials admit, of its leading events. Endeavours will be made, where practicable, also to give the probable dates of the events. 4.

Possibly, as the Tamil legends relate,(6) their founders were three brothers who at first lived together at their primary seat, Korkai, near the mouth of the Tamraparni, from which Cola and Cera went forth and founded principalities of their own, while Pandya extended his dominion round Korkai making the country comprised in the Pandya kingdom his own.

They did not enter there in crushing masses with the destroying force of arms, but in the more peaceful way of exten- sive colonisation, under the protection and countenance of the powerful empires in the north. Though sometimes engaged in wars with their neighbouring tribes, these colonies generally have not taken an offensive but only a defensive part ; and it appears that, after having introduced Brahmanical institutions, laws, and religion, especially along the two coasts of the sea, they did not pretend to impose their language upon the much more numerous inhabitants of the Dekhan, but that they followed the wiser policy of adopting themselves the language of the abori ginal people, and of conveying through its medium their know ledge and instruction to the minds of uncivilised tribes.

The son of an early Cola King, named Tonda or Adanda, cleared it, introduced agricultural colonies and established himself as King, making Kansi (Conjeveram) his capital. (Mira'si papers, page 230). At the date of Ptolemy, (2nd century A..D.) this tract was inhabited by nomads (KurumbarsJ, and at the date of Hiouen Thsang, (the Chinese pilgrim, 7th century) it was a small kingdom with Conjeveram as its capital (Burnell, page 36). The inference, therefore, is, that the Tondaimandalam principality came into existence between the second and seventh centuries. It was in the occupation of Pallavas of the Vengi dynasty as feudatories of the Cera Kingdom about the end of tne seventh century, when it fell under the Coias. In the eleventh century, the Pallavas were feudatories of the Colas. (Burnell, pages.15, 33 and 36). It does not appear when the Pallavas came into the possession of Tondaimandalam.

About 877 A.

It is not clear which of the conquests ascer tained in relation to these two princes are assignable to them individually ; but the valuable researches of Drs.

The inscriptions traced by Dr. Caldwell evidence the Cola occupation of the Pandya kingdom including South Travancore in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

The greater part ofthe endowments of the great temple at Tanjore was, according to an inscrip tion on it, made by Vira or Kulottunga Cola in 1080 A. D., and, in Dr. BurneiTs opinion, the temple was built probably by the same prince/32' The date of this celebrated edifice is thus referrible to the eleventh century, in which probably were built most of the other great Caiva temples in the Tanjore District, though possibly one or two of those in, and in the neighbourhood of, Combaconum were built in or before the seventh, in which century there seems to be some reason to suppose that that old city was the capital of the Colas. It is in like manner possible, that the temple over the rock at Trichinopoly, which tradition represents to have been built by the first Cola, as also the one at Jambukesvaram on the opposite bank of the Cauvery, which is popularly believed to have been once the Cola capital, are referrible to still earlier dates/33) 18.

(34) That the Vira Colanaru, a large channel which branches off from the Cauvery about 3 miles east of Combaconum, was excavated by Vira Cola, may be fairly inferred from its name. 19. To the time of these two famous Colas is Tamil Bamayana referrible the Tamil version of Ramayana, a poem J of high literary merit, by the eminent poet Kam- ban. Bishop Caldwell considers that this work, the publication of which is ascribed by some traditions to the time of Rajaraja (Caldwell's Ra jendra) Cola and by others to that of his successor Vira (Kulottunga) Cola, was possibly commenced in the former's and finished in the latter's reign/35.) 20. Of the last three Colas in the line of succes sion given in para. 14, nothing is known except that the channel known by the name \" Vikramanaru \" was constructed apparently by Vikrama the third in the line. 21.

That conversion of the Ballala sovereign, however, it is well known, was effected by the great Vaishnava teacher, Ramanujacharya, whom traditions uniformly represent as the contemporary of Kerikala Cola, an ardent Caiva, whose persecution led to his flight to Mysore. This discrepancy, however, seems (34) Ibid, page 121. (35) History of Tinnevelly, 29. (36) Ibid, page 30. 94"], [776, "742 Destruction of Uraiyurby a shower of sand. easily explainable on the supposition that Vikrama had also the name Kerikala. The date of the event referred to establishes one important fact, viz., that Tondaimandalam, in which is situated the birth-place and primary seat of Ramanuja, was under the rule of the Colas in the early part of the twelfth century ; for there could have been no need for that teacher fleeing from his own country unless it were under the rule of his persecutor. 22. One important event which, though it does notreston the evidence of inscriptions or other authen tic basis, has apparently a substantial foundation in fact, seems to deserve notice. It is the destruction of Uraiyur, the presumed first capital of the Cola kingdom, by a shower of sand, which occupies a prominent place in the Mackenzie collection of manu scripts. This calamitous visitation is ascribed in one manuscript137) to the wrath of God evoked by the iniquities of the king ; but another(38) in which are repeated the incidents which followed, makes mention of a Pandya invasion, and this with its sequel, the destruction of the city and the king, is probably what the shower of sand means. The story as it runs is, that the Cola's wife, who was then pregnant, cast herself into the Cauvery, but was miraculously res cued and sheltered in the house of a Brahman at Jambukesvaram, where she gave birth to the renowned Kerikala, who was afterwards installed at Comba conum and became so powerful as well as pious a ruler. It has been already indicated that Comba conum was possibly the Cola capital in the 7th cen tury, and the destruction of Uraiyur probably (37) Colapu'rvapattayam C R. 0. M. Vol. Ill, page 48.

The event does not synchronise with the possible date of Kerikala as indicated by Dr. Burnell (see para. 13 ante) ; but there must have been several Colas of a name so famous in tradition, and, moreover, manu scripts, where at all reliable, can be accepted only as affording a clue to known events of historical value and not to precise names or dates. 23.

The Cera country was severed from the Cola territory and absorbed into the Ballala kingdom of Dvara-samu dra probably during its ascendancy in the same (twelfth) century. It has been seen that Cola con quests in the Kalinga were lost in 1228. (39) e. g ;- In the Tanjore District, Colapuram. Colacakranalliir. ColampSttei. Colavidyapuram.

It does not appear when Tondainadu was finally re-separated from the Cola kingdom of which it formed part for several centuries. Probably it was after the rise of the Vijayanagara empire in the 14th century/41) though it is possible that the feuda tories (apparently the Pallavas had given place to a number of local native chiefs) 'had, in the course of the preceding two centuries, become independent except in name. 26. It is not to be distinctly gathered from Bishop Caldwell's Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian languages, second edition, or his history of Tinnevelly \u2014 the two latest as well as the best authorities as to the relation of the two neighbour ing powers, the Pandyas and the Colas, \u2014 that the Cola country was conquered or ruled by the Pandyas at intervals. It is, however, hardly possible that, during the conflicts which these powers seem to have almost perpetually maintained with each other, the one which possessed considerable and often greater prowess should have failed to gain a substantial ascen dancy over the other or to encroach on its territory at any time. Reference has been made (see para, ii) to a long eclipse of the Colas (which probably was little more in fact than a temporary loss of power) prior to the 8th or 9th centurj-, and it has been shown (para. 22 ante) that the legend relating to the destruction of the Cola capital, Uraiytir, is probably traceable to the Pandya conquest. From inscrip tions recording grants of land to temples in the Trichinopoly District by Sundara-Pandya and Vira- Pandya, which have been discovered by Mr. Moore, it would appear that the western portion of the Cola kingdom was under the Pandya rule once before the (41) Ibid, 36."], [779, "745 Ballala (Mysore) supremacy. subjugation of Vira-Pandya by Rajaraja (Caldwell's Rajendra) Cola in the 11th century and once again during the reign of Sundara Pandya at the end of the 13th century/42) The fact that two large Cauvery channels in the Tanjore delta, Panda vayaru and Ativiraramanaru, bear Pandya names, also points to probable temporary occupation by Pandya kings. At least it seems sufficiently clear that, during the declining days of the Colas, probably in the 13th and later centuries, the Pandyas pushed their territory far north beyond the boundary line recognised by the Tamil poets, viz., the Vellaru river. The fact that the seaport town, Ativiraramanpat tanam (Adrampatam) on the Palk's Strait, which is situated about twenty miles from the mouth of the Vellaru in a line with Combaconum inland, bears the name of a Pandya king of the second series, indicates that, in the 16th century, which is the date assigned to the poet king, Ativirarama Pandya/43' that place was under the Pandya dominion. Further, as will be seen in the following chapter, in the same century, and not long after the final extinction of the Pan dyas, the Madura territory almost abutted on the city of Tanjore on the south-west. 27.

Fortunately, however, in the Mackenzie collection, is a brief Telugu palm leaf manuscript in plain colloquial language, designated\" TanjavuruvariCaritra,\"^' which, though probably overlaid in one or two particulars with hy perbole and inaccurate in some of its details, gives, on the whole, an unvarnished and reliable account of the leading incidents connected with this part of the history of Tanjore, as also of its subsequent conquest by the Mahrattas. The narrative contained in the following pages rests mainly on the authority of this manuscript. The last Cola is 2. The last Cola, as already stated, is tradition turned out by a T . . . Viceroy of Vijaya- ally called Virasek hara. He took possession ot Madura, turning out the ruler who was then reigning under the title of Pandya, and the latter appealed to Vijayanagara with the result, that an officer of the name of Kottiyan Nagama Nayak came down and stripped the Cola not only of the territory he had conquered, but also of his own principality. \" Tan javuruvari Caritra\" does not give the date of this event or say who was the ruler of Vijayanagara at this time, but gives the name of the Rayalu who ap pointed the first viceroy of Tanjore as Acyuta. This last named Rayalu, it is well known, was the successor (1) An abstract of this is given in Rev. W.

At the same time, the interval between Nagama Nayak's expedition and the appointment of the first viceroy to Tanjore by Acyuta, assuming the latter to be a fact, could not have been long. On the whole, in the absence of more satisfactory data, the date of the subversion of the Cola dynasty and the commence ment of the Nayak rule in Tanjore may, it seems, be safely fixed about 1530. 3. The name of the Pandya who was dispossessed by the Cola is given in \"Tanjavuruvari Caritra\" as Cendrasek'hara, and is what, upon the authority of other manuscripts, Messrs. Nelson and Moore give in their manuals of Madura and Trichinopoly ;(5) but this is not borne out by Dr. Caldwell's list of the Pandyas of the second series/6) (2) Historv of Tinnevelly, 46.

It is unnecessary to the purpose of the history of Tanjore to follow Naga ma Nayak into Madura. Suffice it to say that, setting aside the so-called Pandya whom he was sent to protect, Nagama began to govern in his own name, and was in turn set aside by his own son, the famous Visvanatha Nayak who, at his own election, was deputed by the Vijayanagara Rayalu to chastise his rebellious father and to reinstate the refugee Pandya.

The Nayak rulers, though they were at first only Viceroys of Vijayanagara, appear to have been latterly practically independent/8) Not long after their conquest of Tanjore, the Vijayanagara empire was shaken to its foundations by the memorable battle of Telikotta (1565), and it thenceforward gradually declined and became finally extinct in the early part of the seventeenth century. It is hardly likely, therefore, that the Nayaks would have con tinued to acknowledge their vassalage to a power which was obviously not in a position to enforce its authority over this distant province. Nor was there any other power which could take the place of Vijayanagara as the paramount authority in the South. The Pathan kings of the Dakhan, who by their combined efforts had succeeded so far as to destroy the great city of Vijayanagara after com mitting a series of the most horrible outrages, had been restrained by mutual mistrust and jealousy from carrying their victory any further than obtain ing the restitution of a few places on the north and a few on the south of the Tungabhadra, which the Vijayanagara rulers had wrested from them. 8.

The Nayaks appear to have governed the country with moderation and a tolerable measure of equity. The Telugu colonies introduced by them into Tanjore could not have been the \" Badagas\" who are repre sented by the early Portuguese Missionaries as law less predatory hordes ; for they have always been known as quiet, law-abiding and respectable people.

The fall of this dynasty was tragical in the extreme.

In the Dravida prin cipalities, the affairs of Government were entrusted to an officer designated \"Dalavay \" (literally General), who combined the functions of both minister and Commander-in-Chief of the army.

It is to be observed that Shahji died in January 1664,(20) and the interval of a little over a year between this date and 1662, the year of the commencement of Sok'kanatha Nayak's reign in Madura,'21' is much too short for the events which, according to the concurrent testimony of traditions, occurred between the fall of the latter's contem porary Vijaya Raghava and the Mahratta acquisition (17) Vol. I, 78.

Duff relies chiefly on the claim said to have been made by Civaji to a moiety of the Tanjore terri tory on the plea that that territory was an acqui sition of his father's, and that, therefore, he and his half-brother Ekoji were entitled to take it in equal shares ; but the correctness of this alleged specific plea does not seem to rest on any authority other than manuscripts and traditions of the Mahratta country/23' Probably, as Wilks suspects/24' the manuscripts confound the conquest of Tanjore by Ekoji with some former invasion by Shahji for the purpose of levying contributions.*25' 21. The date of the acquisition of Tanjore by Ekoji is given in some papers as 1674 and in others as 1675. A statement given in the Mahrathi lan guage by an old servant of the Tanjore palace some time before the year 1787, and of which a transla tion is printed in Appendix VI of Fullarton's \" Vieiv of English interests in India,\" mentions it as 7th February 1675 ; but this specific date was probably that of Ekoji's formal installation, and it may, there fore, with a fair approach to accuracy, be assumed that Tanjore was taken by him in 1674.

The Bijapur conquests comprised a considerable portion of modern Mysore and of the important fortresses of Vellore and Gingi with others of smaller note, among which was Ami, with the territories attached to them, in the Payinghat. Shahji, soon after his arrival in the Karnatak, obtained a large jagir comprising the dis tricts of Kolhar (Colar), Bangalore, H6sk6ta, Bala pur and Sera in Mysore. Probably, while reducing the fortresses in the lower Karnatak between the years 1638 and 1648,(8) Shahji levied a military contribution on the Nayak chiefs of Madura and Tanjore and also exacted from them a submission to the suzerain authority of Bijapur with an engage ment (never regularly fulfilled in those days) to pay tribute.

The interview was, so far as this special ob ject was concerned, productive of no result ; but this is ascribable apparently not to Civaji's incapacity to coerce or crush Ekoji, but to a regard for him as well as to a desire not to resort to violent or unseemly measures towards a brother. He, however, seized Tukkoji's possessions in Mysore and Arni,(9) and pro ceeded on his return march to Dakhan, leaving in charge of his conquests another half-brother of his, Santaji, the illegitimate son of Shahji, who had attached himself to Civaji's cause. Civaji, however, had hardly crossed the Tungab'hadra, when intelli gence reached him that an attack made by Ekoji upon his troops under tbe command of Santaji, had been repulsed with considerable loss. Civaji there upon wrote to Ekoji pointing out his very indiscreet conduct.

About Ihe middle of the seventeenth century, Vedo Bhaskar's great grandson, Tirumalei Rao, was ousted by Navab Muhammad Ali, but was re instated, at the intercession of Raja Pratapsing, in 1762, subject to an annual payment of Rs 10,000 as nazar or tribute to the Navab. It continues in the possession ofthe same family as jagir, charged, after a deduction for the motur phatax abolished aud certain other adjustments, with an annual payment of Rs. 5,098 as peshkash to the British government.

The longer of the two periods would bring his reign down to only 1681 ; but from Wilks' South of India, Vol. I, Ekoji is seen negotiating for the sale of Bangalore to the Mysore chief just before, if not in, 1687, when that place was taken by the Moghals.

It does not appear how far the Tanjore ter ritory actually extended on the south at the date of Ekoji's conquest in the latter part of the seventeenth century. Apparently, it did not extend as far as the present boundary line of the Tanjore Collectorate or even as far as the nominal boundary line ofthe Cola kingdom, i.e., the river Vellaru ; for it has been seen that, at one time recently, the Madura territory stretched so far north along the coast as the port of Ativiraramanpattanam. There seems to be little doubt, however, that the recognised boundary line, whatever it may have been, was exposed to the con stant raids and encroachments of the Marava chiefs of Ramanath(17a) who had now risen greatly in power. Indeed, it is said that about the middle of the seventeenth century, the then Marava chief, Raghunatha Tevan, extended his authority to Man nargudi in Tanjore. 14.

Britto (1693), the right of succession to the Marava chiefship be came the subject of violent contest, attended with bloodshed, between two rival claimants, Tanda Tevan, a descendant in a collateral branch, of a former chief, and Bhavani Cankara, an illegitimate son of Kilavan. The latter's cause was espoused by the Raja of Tanjore, while the Nayak of Madura and the Tondaman<18)of Pudukkdttei (Poodoocottah) support ed the former. The troops of Madura and Puduk kdttei, however, were put to flight by the Tan jore general, Ananda Rao Peshva,(19) who, having seized and slain Tanda, put Bhavani-Cankara in pos session of the country. 15. Soon after, however, a confederacy was formed against Bhavani Cankara by two other pre tenders, named Katta Tevan and Ceshavarna Tevan, both of the Marava caste, of whom the former was maternal uncle of Tanda and the latter, a petty Pala yagaran (Poligar) or ivatcher,*-20) was son-in-law of Vijaya Raghunatha. The Tanjoreans now did not hesitate to aid the confederacy, and ' ' some ill behavi our\"^21' on the part of Bhavani Cankara (probably refusal to make the promised cession of territory) offered a fair pretext for their interference. Ac cordingly, an army from Tanjore marched against him, made him prisoner and sent him off to Tanjore. The whole of the Marava territory was now divided into three divisions; the country north of the Pamban river was made over to Tanjore, and the remainder (18) A Tamil word signifying a lord or chief.

This arrangement took place about the year 1730. In the official correspondence 1730. throughout the last century, the Marava chiefs of \u25a0Qivaganga are styled \" Nalkdttei, \" apparently from the first chief having held four forts. They are sometimes styled also Little Marava in contradis tinction to the chiefs of Ramanath, who are called Greater Marava. 16. It was not however long before the Tanjo reans tried to turn the table again in favour of their prisoner Bhavani Cankara, but Kattan was able to hold his own. He not only defeated the troops which they sent under general Sidd'hoji, but wrested back all the Marava territory which had been ceded to the Raja of Tanjore, excepting presumably the fort of Aruntangi and the districts dependent on it.<22> 17 Matters stood in this position until about the middle of the eighteenth century, when Raja Pratap sing sent an expedition under his famous general, Mankoji, who shortly after made himself infamous by faithlessly and inhumanly disposing of Chanda Saheb at Trichinopoly.

Mankoji had agreed to make over to the Tondaman, as a reward for his co-operation, the fort of Kilanilei near Arun tangi, with the small territory attached to it ; but the Raja declined to give effect to his general's promise. The Tondaman, however, continued to urge his claim to this cession throughout the century, and it was eventually satisfied by the English govern ment transferring it to him in 1803.(23) 18. Then again, in 1763, the minister of Ramanath, one Damddaram Pillei, with the aid of the chief of Civaganga, seized all the country which Mankoji had re-annexed to Tanjore, and shared it with him. At this time, Raja Pratapsing, according to his son's account as will be seen further on, was prevailed upon by Navab Muhammad Ali to defer taking any action against the Maravas, in order that his resources might be available in aid of the expedition then projected by the Navab against Madura. 19. Pratapsing died the same year, and eight years later, in 1771, his son Raja Tulzaji led an expedition against Ramanath, and recovered all previous annexa tions with the fort and district of Hanumantagudi south of the Pamban river, in addition. He further wrested from the Rani regent of Ramanath elephants, jewels and guns of the value of Rs. 30,000, with a bond for one lakh of rupees, and obtained repara tion from Nalkdttei, the chief of Civaganga, for the seizure of certain elephants of his while on their way from Ceylon to Tanjore. 20.

This last was likewise soon set aside, and Pratapsing was raised to the throne. These rapid revolutions took place in the course of five years between the death of Tukkoji about 1735 and the accession of Pratapsing in 1740, when the. Government became settled. 22. There is a haze over the circumstances con nected with the elevation and deposition of Saiyaji. That a prince of this name came forward and solicit ed the aid of the Enghsh in recovering the Tanjore principality of which, as he said, he had been unlaw fully dispossessed, admits of no doubt, as it is record ed in the proceedings of the old Presidency of Fort St. David,(27) and is further alluded to by all English historians ; and yet he is totally ignored in Tanjore, his name appearing in none of the pedigrees or tradi tionary accounts. This seems easily accountable; (26) Tradition relates the story of this pretender thus -. \u2014 Carabhoji, the second son of Ekoji, it has been seen, had no issue. One of his queens, named Aparupa, Bai, out of envy of the wives of Tukkoji, the third son of Ekoji, who had ohildren, and with the view to prevent the inheritance of the crown passing on to their children, pretended pregnancy and foisted upon her husband, as his own offspring, a stranger boy who was named Savai Shahji. The jugglery, however, was discovered, and the counterfeit heir was, by order of Carabhoji, got rid of, that is, put to death presumably. This being the case, many years afterwards, upon the death of Bava Saheb without issue\", one Koyanji Ghitntge set up another boy, alleging that he was that Savai Shahji, and that he was lawful heir. This second counterfeit son of Carabhoji was the offspring of a batik or slave woman, named Rupi, (beautiful/, and he was afterwards called Kattu Raja, because, when proclaimed as Raja he came from the Udayarpalayam jungle, whither he had been taken by the' Ghahtge for the purpose of engaging the aid of the Palayagar.

The political relation between the Tanjore Rajas and the Mahratta power in the Dakhan, if there had ever been any, had ceased entirely on Civaji's death in 1680 ; but it appears that at this period Pratapsing maintained a friendly correspondence with the Peshvas.(35' 25.

In the first of these conducted by his eldest son Maphuz Khan, the Tanjorean army con- sisted, as the letter says, of 5,000 horse and 30,000 foot, composed of natives of Balghat and other countries, and the loss of the Tanjoreans amounted to 200 men killed, 400 wounded and about 40 taken prisoners. Nothing is said of the strength of the Navab's army or of the loss it sustained. The second battle, according to the Navab's letter, was conducted by Anwar-ud-din Khan himself, assisted by his sons Maphuz Khan and Muhammad Ali, as well as by several petty chiefs, among whom was Venka- tappa Nayak, Zamindar of Kalahasti (Calastry).

At the beginning of 1749, Saiyaji/1' the deposed Sa^aj^soiiettBthe Raja, appeared at Fort St. David and solicited the 1749. aid of the English Company in \" regaining his king- dom,\" agreeing to give them, in recompense for their services, the fort of Divikkdttei situated at the mouth of the Coleroon, with a territory contiguous to it, and to pay all the expenses of the expedition, if it proved successful. He had, he said, \"received such assurances both by letters and messages from the principal men and officers at Tanjore, that in case he could by any means raise a body of forces and march that way, they would certainly join with him, and put him in possession of his just right without the effusion of biood.\"(2' 2.

At last, reinforced with 100 Europeans and 500 sepoys, the troops crossed the Coleroon and entered the Tanjore coun- try; but no followers of Saiyaji joined them; on the contrary, large bodies of troops of the reigning Raja, while keeping themselves at a distance through fear of the field pieces of the Enghsh, annoyed them with their arrows and the fire of their matchlocks. The expedition however, proceeded on its march and arrived within a mile of the fort of Divikkdttei ; but the intervening thick wood prevented the troops from discovering the ships which were anchored four miles off at the mouth of the river with their battering cannon and provisions. Unable, therefore, to batter the fort which, by reason of the great height of the walls, could not be easily escaladed, and pressed by the want of provisions, the army retreated, taking the road by which it came, not, however, without again experiencing some annoyance from the fire of the musketry and pieces of heavy artillery, which the Raja's troops had brought into the thickets through which the English had to pass on their return. Another accident added to their loss. Their route was intersected by a stream, which the army had crossed at low tide on its march to Divikkdttei, but which was now swollen with the rising tide, and 400 of the camp followers in trying to swim across the stream were drowned. The army halted until the tide had ebbed, and then pursuing the march reached Fort St. David the following day.'3' 3. The cause of Saiyaji was now found to be altogether destitute of local support; but it was con sidered of importance to retrieve the loss of prestige, as well as to seek compensation for the expenses (3) Orme Vol. 1, 111\u2014112."], [817, "783 incurred. Further, Divikkdttei from its situation seemed to hold out great commercial advantages ; for, if the mouth of the river could only be kept clear of silt (a condition which was discovered at a later date to be impracticable), it would be an excel lent harbour for large vessels, such as is no where to be found along the whole coast line between Masuli patam and Cape Comorin/4' 4. Accordingly, in the following month (\"May), Second expedition; a second expedition consisting of the whole body of fort is taken, Jun8 the Company's troops (800 Europeans and 1,500 1749' sepoys) under the command of Major Stringer Lawrence, was fitted up, and, in consideration of the difficulties experienced on the previous occasion in approaching Divikkdttei by land, the army with the artillery and baggage now proceeded by sea. The troops were moved in boats up an arm of the river to Divikkdttei, and were landed on the opposite bank, as the ground on the Divikkdttei side was marshy and covered with wood, and the Raja's troops were encamped under the walls of the fort. The fort was accordingly battered from the opposite shore, and a breach was made in one of its walls ; but to storm the breach, the intervening stream which was wide and rapid, had to be crossed. For the means by which the army accomplished this object, it was indebted to the ingenuity of a carpenter belonging to one of the ships, named John Moor, who contrived to construct a raft capable of receiv ing 400 men and found means to move it across with the aid of a rope which, swimming the river with it at night, he fastened to a tree on the oppo site bank, carefully concealing it in the bushes and water. The troops were then moved across in (i) Ibid, 112."], [818, "784 Raja Pratapsing concludes peace, ceding a small terri tory adjoining Divik kdttei. successive batches, a brisk artillery fire all the time covering the spot where the rope was fixed, so as to prevent the enemy approaching. The attack on the breach was led on by Lieut afterwards Lord, Clive, the founder of the British empire in India, and the fort was taken in June 1749. Lieut Clive, however, in this operation narrowly escaped with his life. When a platoon of Europeans was formed for the purpose of the assault, a party of the enemy's horse, who had concealed themselves behind a tower, \" rushed sword in hand, and by a rapid evolution which manifested the excellence both of the horses and the riders, fell on the rear of the platoon with so much impetuosity, that the men had no time to face about and defend themselves ; in an instant 26 of the platoon were cut to pieces. A horseman had his sword uplifted to strike at Lieut Clive, who escaped the blow by stepping on one side, whilst the horse passed him.\" The loss of the English on the whole in this expedition amounted to 60 Euro- peans and 50 sepoys killed. The loss on the Raja's side, which, of course, must have been far greater, is not clearly ascertainable. Afterwards, a detach- ment of the English army took possession of the Achavaram tem- temple of Achavaram, four miles to the south-west of Divikk6ttei, which the Raja's troops defended with obstinate bravery and surrendered only after 300 of their men had fallen/5' It was, however, after- wards restored to them. 5. Raja Pratapsing now sent offers of accom modation. The terms demanded by the English were, that he should cede for ever the fort of Divikkdttei with a territory adjoining it, yielding an annual income of 9,000 pagodas (Rs. 31,500) ; pay (5) Ibid, U3-118,"], [819, "785 Events in the Kar. natak, 1749\u20141752. a war indemnity of a lakh of rupees, and allow a pension of Rs 4,000 per annum for the maintenance of Saiyaji. They on their part agreed to secure Saiyaji's person and to guarantee that he should cause no disturbance to the principality. The Raja acceded to these terms, and an agreement was con cluded between his officers and Major Lawrence accordingly on the 25th June 1 749 /,J' The cession of territory/7) however, took place some time later, i.e., on 1st January 1751. Siayaji who, it would seem, was kept a prisoner at Fort St. David, made his escape ; but his (maternal?) uncle was kept in confine ment until the French who took Fort St. David in 1758 set him at liberty. (8) Nothing further is known of Saiyaji or of his family. 6. The fort of Divikkdttei, which thus cost the English Company two troublesome expeditions, was about a mile in circumference with six unequal sides ; its walls were about 18 feet high. It does not appear that the Company established any factory at this place. The fort was abandoned by the English garrison on the fall of Fort St. David and the approach of a large French force on 4th June 1758. It was evacuated by the French after Coote's victory at Vandewash, and was re-garrisoned by the English on the 4th February 1760. 7.

These confederates descended into the Karnatakwith a large body of troops which they had succeeded in collecting, and at the battle of Ambur, in which they were aided by French troops, killed Navab Anwar- ud-din and took Arcot, where Muzaffar Jung assumed the title of the Sub'hedar of the Dakhan and Chanda Saheb that of the Navab of the Karnatak ; Anwar-ud-din's son Muhammad Ali fleeing to, and finding safety in the fortress of, Trichinopoly.

They sent troops to defend the fortress of Trichinopoly to which Chanda Saheb, with the aid of the French, had laid siege. Muham- mad Ali also called to his assistance the Mysoreans, the Mahratta chief, Murar Rao Ghorphade of Gutti, and the Tanjore troops. In the campaign before Trichinopoly which ensued, the British troops gained a complete victory, and Chanda Saheb, reduced to despondency, delivered himself up, under promise of protection, into the hands of the Tanjore General, Mankoji, who most faithlessly had him beheaded.

The Raja's fears were soon verified. Pressed for money to meet the expenses of their projected expedition, Chanda Saheb and Muzaffar Jung, in October of that year, on their way to Trichinopoly, halted at Tanjore, in order to exact as much money as they could from the Raja. Here they summoned the Raja to pay his arrears of tribute to the Moghal empire, as well as a large sum as compensation for the expenses of their late war with Anwar-ud-din Khan, and their demands amounted altogether to four crores of rupees. Pratapsing, with an alternate show of submission and resistance, contrived to occupy them with negotiations and promises, till the middle of December, and in the meantime joined Muhammad Ali in secretly inviting Nazir Jung who, being in actual possession of the power as well as title of Sub'hedar, was in a position to crush both the pretended Sub'- hedar and the pretended Navab of Arcot. He also solicited the aid of the English who were however only able to send 20 Europeans to his assistance, and these, detached from Trichinopoly, entered the city of Tanjore in the night. At last, after a short bom- bardment and other hostile demonstrations, the con federates succeeded so far as to induce the Raja to seek for accommodation. He agreed to pay seventy"], [822, "788 lakhs of rupees to Chanda Saheb as Navab and two lakhs immediately in hand to the French. He also ceded to the latter 81 villages, calculated to yield an annual income of Rs. 1,06,000, in the neighbourhood of the seaport town of Kareikkal where they had established themselves and built a fort sixteen years before without leave. Chanda Saheb obtained a bond for fifty-six lakhs of rupees; but before the \u2022 payment of the remainder in the shape of jewels, bullion and specie could be completed, news arrived that Nazir Jung was coming, and the Muhammadan confederates, struck with terror, broke up their camp and fled to Pondicherry.

Pratapsing now once again opened his eyes and saw the mistakes he had made.

The next noteworthy event in the history of J^rno\u00b0lfi\\\\Frms Tanjore was the hostile visit of the French Governor Lally, the successor of M. Dupleix, in 1758. The French Government were in possession of the bond for fifty-six lakhs of rupees, which Chanda Saheb had obtained from Pratapsing in 1749, and this amount, if recovered, would afford considerable relief to the French who at the time were in a state of hopeless bankruptcy. Further, the French had lately, upon the surrender of Fort St. David, set at . liberty the uncle of the deposed Raja, Saiyaji, who, though he possessed no pretensions in his own person, was the chief mover in the efforts made to procure the reinstatement of Saiyaji, and might be regarded by the timid Raja to be a source of danger to him. 16. Accordingly, an expedition headed by Lally himself, but very deficiently provided with draught cattle as well as ammunition and provisions, started (16) Ibid 361."], [826, "792 from Pondicherry and arrived at Kareikkal on the 25th June. Lally thence proceeded to Nagur, a sea port town 8 miles south, where, from that town being reputed to be rich, he expected to get a large booty ; but the merchants had time to remove all their valuable effects, and the place yielded only a trifle. On the 28th, he arrived at Kivaliir, 8 miles inland from Negapatam, the seat of a large Hindu temple, and where he had been led by deceptive informers to expect an immense amount of gold. Here, Lally \" ransacked and dug the houses, dragged the tanks, and took the idols out of the chapels, but no treasures were found ; and the idolsproved to be only of brass.\" He further, mistaking for spies six unhappy Brah mans who lingered about his camp to try to recover their images, had them shot away from the muzzles of the guns. Lally at last arrived and sat down before the capital, and negotiations ensued, in the course of which he offered to abate his demands, if he were furnished with 600 bullocks and a supply of gunpowder. His agents, however, suppressed the item of gunpowder, as disclosing the weak point of the expedition, and the Raja refused the bullocks, declaring that his religion would not permit of his granting them. Then ensued an alternate succes sion of negotiation and hostile demonstration, which continued until the first week of August, and in the meantime two successive detachments of English troops had, on the Raja's application, come from Trichinopoly to his aid. By this time Lally' s store of ammunition and provisions was very nearly exhausted, and intelligence arriving that an English fleet had anchored off Kareikkal, he was compelled to raise the siege, and as he was preparing to depart, the Tanjore troops attempted a surprise, from which Lally and his followers narrowly escaped with their"], [827, "793 lives.

The English, however, were neither prepared nor disposed to go to war with the Raja, and the act of spoliation wished for by the Navab was totally incon sistent with the just policy of the Madras Council, under the presidency of Mr. George, afterwards Lord, Pigot. 18 Governor Pigot accordingly deputed Mr. Treaty of 1762, t, , i \u2022 n, ., i \"\"der British gua- Josiah Da Pre, the second in Council, to settle, mrautee, with respect personal communication with both the Navab and by the rV* paya the Raja, the terms of the tribute payable by the latter, as also his obligation in respect of the arrears which remained unliquidated.

But now (in 1764), Muhammad Ali would neither himself repair nor allow the Raja to repair breaches in the bund ; he in fact claimed the right to destroy the irrigation and with it the prosperity of Tanjore. Raja Tulzaji, naturally filled with alarm, solicited the interposition of the English. A member of Council, Mr. James Bourchier, was deputed to inspect the locality and settle the matter in personal communication with the Navab and the Raja. After a protracted correspondence in which the Governor, the Hon. Robert Palk, employed earnest solicitation as well as convincing argument, the Navab gave a reluctant consent to the Raja keeping the bund in repair. The subject was even reported to the Court of Directors, who expressed satisfaction at the success which had attended the interposition of the Madras Government. The banks of the Cauvery in the limits of Trichinopoly, nevertheless, continued to be a source of anxiety to the Raja, and their repair the subject of contention between him and the Navab.

The case for the Raja was this : \u2014 Tanjore, it was true, had escaped the destructive ravages of Hyder who spared no part of the Navab's dominions south of Madras ; but this immunity had been purchased at no small expense, and the Raja had not the means at the same time to render much assistance to the Navab. Had he not secured the good will of Hyder by the payment of a heavy contri bution, he probably would have shared the fate which notlongafter befell Murar Rao of Gutti, and perhaps no vestige ofthe Mahratta name would have remained in Tanjore. The terms of the treaty of 1762 expressly limited the Raja's obligation to a specific annual payment ; the Navab on his part promising \" that he will not demand any thing more.\" By the terms of the Mysore treaty of 1769, the Raja had, in like manner with the Navab, become an ally of Hyder, and apparently, therefore, was guilty of no grave transgression in maintaining (24) Ibid No. XXI, 574 and 575.

Under this treaty, Tanjore became a British province, and the Raja had ensured to him a fixed annual allowance of one lakh of pagodas or three and-a-half lakh of Rupees with a fifth of the net revenues of the coun try; these terms being identical with those secured by the next preceding treaty in the case of war. Provision was made in the treaty for the allow ance settled upon the deposed Raja, Amarsing, being deducted from the net revenues before deter mining the one-fifth share payable to Carabhoji. With the close of the eighteenth century, therefore, it may be said, the political history of Tanjore as a distinct principality came to an end. The period of the Mahratta dynasty, which was the last that ruled Tanjore, thus comprised exactly a century and-a- quarter. 59. Raja sarabhoji enjoyed his rank and dignity, with the pecuniary benefits attached to it, for thirty four years, and on his death in 1 832 the same honors and privileges were continued to his son, Civaji, until his death in 1855. a number of vii- 60.

The landed property thus retained by him at the cession of the country,' with certain additions subsequently made to it by purchase by Rajas Carabhoji and Civaji, now constitutes the private property of the family, and yields on an average about a lakh and-a half of Rupees annually. 61. By the terms of the treaty, the fort of The Raja allowed Tanjore, which had been garrisoned by British troops, authority within the was evacuated, and Raja C-arabhoji was allowed to \u00a3\"\u00a3\u00a3 to exercise sole authoritv within it.

Rajas Carabhoji and Civaji had salutes of 21 guns, and the Government have recently conferred upon the surviving princess a salute of 13 guns and also the title of the Companion of the Crown of India. 63. His Highness Carabhoji was very warm in his gratitude to his early preceptor and benefactor, Mr. Schwartz. The Rev. Gentleman, although he had taken a very active part in advocating the claims of Qarabhoji, did not live to see him placed on the musnud/73' but the Raja was ever ready to evince his respect for the memory of his benefactor. He was particularly indulgent to the Danish Missionaries and afforded liberal patronage to their schools. C/arabhoji was at the same time a staunch Hindu, and very strict in the observance of the rites and duties enjoined by his own religion. He patronized men of learning and made an extensive collection of books chiefly English and Sanskrit; the Library in the Tanjore palace is perhaps the largest and most valu able in the whole of Southern India. He possessed a respectable knowledge of English. He was care ful in the selection of men to conduct his affairs and frugal in the management of his finances. 64. Carabhoji was not free from the besetting weakness of native princes. He had a seraglio in true oriental fashion, and the affairs of this establish ment, known by the name of \"Kalyana Mahal\" have been repeatedly before Government in the Poli tical Department. This institution, first formed about (73) Mr. Schwartz died at Tanjore about three months before Carabhoji was formally proclaimed. Raja,"], [861, "827 the year 1824, consisted, at his death, of two princi pal and twenty -four inferior or dependent women, of which latter eight are now alive. The Raja made a liberal provision for all these women collectively in the shape of an endowment in landed and funded property, but at the same time took care to provide that, as lapses occurred among the inmates of the seraglio, the accumulating surplus of its income and eventually the entire endowment with the splendid palace which he had erected for the residence of the women, should be appropriated to charitable pur poses. He at the same time provided efficient super intendence for the management of the endowment in view of this ultimate end. C, arabhoji's favorite mistress in youth was a woman of an inferior caste of the name of Muktamba who died, while yet young, soon after his accession to the musnud, and it was in honor of her that he founded the splendid charita ble institution known as the \" Muktambapuram Chattram,\" about fourteen miles south-east from Tanjore. 65. Raja *yivaji was manly and open-hearted, butch.^e\u00b0iv**-1 : his exceedingly capricious and self-willed ; one of the leading features of his character was infatuation for his favorites and lavishness in bestowing gifts and bene fits on them. He was from his boyhood so wayward and intractable, that his father, with all his efforts to give him a good education, could give him very little. At length, Carabhoji became so much disgust ed, that his dislike grew into hatred. In the words of the Special Commissioner, Mr. N. W. Kindersley, ' His Hiarhness' treatment of his son was more like that of a state prisoner than of heir to the musnud.' 66. In his youth, Raja Civaji was married to His family. three wives (daughters of his three sisters), of whom"], [862, "828 His Seraglio, the eldest, named Saidamba Bai Saheb, and the youngest, Padmamba Bai Saheb, died before him, and the second is the present surviving senior Rani, Ka makshi amba Bai Saheb. The eldest Rani, Saidamba Bai Saheb, had alone issue, viz., two daughters, of whom the elder, who was married to Sakharam Saheb, died childless soon after the Raja. The other daughter is the present princess, Vijayamohana mukta Bai Amani Raje Saheb, the only surviving legitimate child of the late Raja. She was nine years old at her father's death, and on her attaining the age of marriage, was married in 1860 to the hus band of her deceased elder sister. Besides the three wives above mentioned, the Raja, three years before his death, married in a body seventeen girls of whom two died before him and soar have deceased since. At present, therefore, the surviving family of the Raja consists of twelve widows/74' and one daughter. 67. Civaji had a large seraglio to which he gave the name of \" Mangalavilas,\" and_which at the date of his death contained 60 women, with 17 children born among them. The numbers now surviving are 33 concubines and 12 offspring, viz., 5 sons and 7 daughters. 68. Raja Civaji had five sisters of whom only one, named Sakha var Bai amani, is now alive.

From M. R. WELD, Esq., Acting Head Assistant Collector of Tanjore, to the Honorable D. ARBUTHNOTT, Collector of Tanjore, dated Mayaveram, 8th September 1873, No. 233. With reference to Mr. Cadell's letter of the 24th January 1873, No. 68, I have the honor to submit the following report regarding snakes. 2. The method of investigation which I pursued has been as follows: \u2014 I have had snakes brought me from various quarters, and, having ascertained their native names, I have endeavored to identify them with those described under their scientific names in Dr. Nicholson's book on Indian Snakes ; where I failed, I used to send the snakes by bhangy, in empty potted-meat tins, either alive in a perforated tin, or preserved in spirits, or (when a tin man could not be procured to seal up the tins) in a paste com posed of spirits and bran, to Dr. Shortt, who in every case most kindly answered my inquiries. 3. At page 28 of his work, Dr. Nicholson says, \" Natives of India, of tho south at least, know nothing about snakes, have no names for them, and can give nothing buterroneous information.'' No doubt many erroneous beliefs are current among them on the subject, but they have names for almost all snakes, and though they vary in different districts, and several snakes of different families are at times classed under a common name which leads to confusion, they are often very expressive and much more appropriate than the scientific names. 4. I enclose a list of names submitted by the Tahsildars. This is swelled to 105 by repetitions, several names being repeated under different classes. I also send some drawings and a letter of Dr. Shortt's stating his opinion of their worthlessness, after the receipt of which- I ordered the sending of drawings to be dis continued. f . (a.) Of the native names that for two species of tree snake Q\u00e6irLoQuiBQpi\u00e6eiir, Komberi mukkan, the branch-ascending long nosed fellow, is very appropriate ; one of these is also called u&esi&uiriiiLi, Pacchei pambu, or green snake. To these snakes, neither of which are poisonous, natives attribute most atrocious"], [898, "XXXII malignity. They are supposed to stoop from a branch, to which they hang by the tail, strike the unwary passer in the eye and then ascend to the tree top, which they do not quit until they have feasted their eyes with the sight of the smoke of their victim's funeral pyre. The Mayaveram Tahsildar discovered a curiosity in the shape of a poet at Terukadeiyur village, who has celebrated in Tamil verse the deeds of each kind of snake. Truly these heroes will not die for want of a Homer. (b) aiLp^n Vazalie (probably from aiipsi, Vazalu, slime) is the name given to the common brown snake (Lycodon anlicus) which when fresh looks like a stick of glue. (c.) atsm-i\u2014iai\u00c6QFjziiLe&d Kandam karuvazalie(the black Vazalie whose body is in kandams or lengths) is the name given to the Bungarus arcuatus (poisonous) whose black body is divided into kandams by thin white arches. (d.) The name Kattu viriyau, \u00c6tl\u00aea0rf?jjsjr (not \u00e6u.t\u2014<&ifiiusa, Katta viriyan, as given in Board's Proceedings, 30th April 1872> No. 686,) is applied indiscriminately to all small-banded snakes ; thus specimens of the Simotes Russellii, the Dipsas trigonata, the Trophidonotus quincunciatus, the Lycodon (some of which are banded, others not, those without bands being called Vazalie, as already mentioned), the Gongylophis (generally called Podei yan), some small snakes which I believe were young Bungari (unfortunately Dr. Shortt was absent from Madras when I sent them and they died before he saw them), and the poisonous Carinata echis (gen r rally called i-/a)sfl/fl_jOT, Pul (grass) viriyan) have beenbronrrht to me as Kattu viriyans. The Carinata echis is not unlike ihe harmless Dipsas trigonata in its markings ; in Madras, Dr. Shortt tells me, the Dipsas trigonata is called the Qi_I(T5(_5*(T5c1\u00abdl_, Perum (big) suruttei, and the Carinata echis the a_s/\u00ab-25clw)t_, Siru (little) suruttei, the former grows to three feet while the latter rarely exceeds 1^ feet ; the name Suruttei is given, because of the habit they have in common of resting them selves in a complicated coil. Though appearing not unlike in the marking of their backs at first sight, and no doubt not easy to distinguish until killed, there is yet considerable difference be tween them, and the head and tail are totally different; in the Dipsas trigonata, the head is regularly shielded and the tail long with numerous bifid subcandals, while in the Carinata echis the head is scaled instead of shielded and the tail short, tapering almost as rapidly as the point of a pencil, with single subcan-"], [899, "XXXIII dais. The evil of bad company is shown by the bad name which all the Kattu viriyans, most of whom are innocent, have, owing to the evil deeds of the Carinata echis. The original meaning of \u00e6L-tB, Kattu, is a tie or bandage, hence doubtless the nameKattu viriyan, the banded viriyan, but natives turn to the secondary meaning of Kattu, a boil, abscess or tumor, and say that the snakes are so called because their bite causes the body of the sufferer to become covered with ulcers, they also say that the victim will faint once for every band on the snake's body and finally die. (e.) The names Kannadi viriyan (asm/ann?., a spectacle glass) and Changili viriyan (*/b9\u00ab.-S, a chain) describe well the markings of the Daboia elegans. 6. The following are the snakes I have found in Tanjore District with their scientific names and those by which they are known amongst the natives. I have also mentioned the page in which they are given in Dr. Nicholson's Descriptive Catalogue of Indian Snakes. Non-Poisonous Snakes. (a.) Si motes Bus sellii (page 66) brought me as a \u00c6il\u00aeafl/fli/sjr Kattu viriyan. (b.) Ptyas mucosus, the stout Dhaman (page 77) called fa asmuiruin, Sarei pambu, known to Anglo-Indians as the whip-snake, rat-snake, and male cobra ; it is erroneously believed by natives to breed with the cobra and to be venomous (\"Venomous whip snake.\" \u2014 Bellary Manual, page 98) ; at Pudupatnam, Shialli Taluq, in July last, one seven feet ten inches long was brought to me. (c.) Trophidonotus quincunciatus. \u2014 The checkered snake (page 81) ; a small specimen was once brought as a Kattu viriyan, but the usual name is SHQsiipLLmi\u2014, Nir Korattei, the water hold fast ; it abounds in the irrigated fields along with the Trophi donotus plumbicolor and gets its name from the belief that when it bites it never lets go till the piece comes out. (d.) Trophidonotus stolatus, chameleon snake (page 83) called sp&nuniJDLi, Wolei pambu in Tanjore (wolei, a cadjan, so called perhaps from its brown color). Dr. Shortt tells njp in Madras it is known as a&viuiii(gjL-Lp.) Kaleiyan kutti (<sc%o<u_o pot, @^4S a small thing), because it is said to lie among the pots. (e.) The Trophidonotus plumbicolor (page 84) called iuirwLj, Tannir pambu, the water snake, is even more numerous E"], [900, "XXXIV in the irrigated fields that the Trophidonotus quincunciatus. One would hardly recognise it from Dr. Nicholson's descrip tion. It is of a dirty mud-colored green on the back with a yellow belly. The Trophidonoti are amphibious ; the Trophidonotus quin cunciatus and Trophidonotus plumbicolor being the \"water snakes \" which are to be seen in such numbers in almost every paddy-field, tank, and channel in India. I have heard of a certain ,tiriDif,u.-ar, (Nir viriyan) which frequents the back waters and which is reputed to be poisonous, perhaps this is one of theHoma copsidae (Nicholson, page 87, et seq.), but of this I have not been able to procure any specimens. Tree Snakes. (/.) Dendrophis pictus called Q\u00abirii<?u/%*\u00c6\u00c6dr, Komberi mukkan. In this snake the ventrals are divided into three parts, or it may be regarded as having nariow ventrals flanked on each side by a large and peculiarly-shaped scale, as shown in the figure <7T ~A> \u2022 Those -which I have seen are bronze -with blue margins to the scales which on the sides almost cover the entire scale, so that below, the blue forms a well-defined line against the bronze belly ; above, these margins grow narrower, gradually giving place to the bronze of the centre of the scale. Thus there is a bronze stripe down the centre of the back not bounded by any defined line but shading imperceptibly into the blue of the sides- This is one of the most beautiful of snakes. (<?.) Passerita mycterizans (page 95), the green tree snake called by natives umj-uulol/, Pacchei pambu (green snake) or Pacchei komberi mukkan, by Anglo-Indians the \" eye-snake\" and the \" green whip-snake. \" There is a green tree viper which is poisonous, Trimesurus viridis (page 112) ; this inhabits hilly jungles and is not found in Tanjore. I saw some fine specimens of these with Dr. Shortt which he had brought from the Shevaroys. They are not at all like the common green snake, being stout, with keeled scales and of a dark olive green, while the common green snake is long and scraggy, of a light green, with long crocodile-like jaws and a projecting appendage like a beak. (h.) Dipsas trigonata, (page 96,) brought as a Kattu viriyan. I have already spoken of the resemblance between this snake and the Carinata echis, paragraph 5 (d)."], [901, "XXXV This ends the tree snakes. (i) Lycodon anlicus, the flat-nosed brown snake, (page 97,) called Kattu viriyan when banded, Vazalei when not\u2014 paragraph 5 (b) and (d). The color is generally chocolate brown, but I have a specimen which is nearly black ; it is however easily distinguishable from the black vazalei (Bungarus) by the shape of the head and the appearance of the bands. From Dr. Nicholson's description, one would suppose it is invariably banded, but it is most commonly found without bands in this district. The lips are white with a row of brown specks all along the mouth above and below. (k.) Python molurus, (page 102,) the rock snake generally called Oa/eBJriemj/san^, Vennandei, white owl, why I cannot say unless the name is a corruption of eiit<x)<sm\u00aesii\u2014, Vanandei lord of the forest. Small specimens under seven feet long have been brought to me as G^i^Sbafl/flujar, Shentale viriyan (shen talei, red-headed) from the color of the head which has frequent ly a shade of the lake in it. The Shentalei viriyan (though not the Vennandei, which is supposed to be a different species) has the reputation of being poisonous, and is celebrated by the above-mentioned Tamil poet. After inflicting its bite, it is supposed to insert its claws (the rudimentary hind limbs which this and two other species of snakes have, Nicholson, page 4) into the wound and tear it. There is a stuffed specimen in Combaconum Dispensary over ten feet long. I have the skin of one which was killed at Trivalore, on the 26th August last, and brought before the Sub-Magistrate, with a monkey which it had killed ; the shrivelled skin now measures thirteen feet in length. (Sand snakes) Erycid\u00e6 (page 103). (I.) The Gongylophis, called Quaas>u.ium, Pcdeiyan, some times Kattu viriyan. The colors of this snake are like those of a leper, whence probably the native belief that it gives leprosy by licking the feet of wayfarers. The colors are pretty distinct in young specimens, but less so in adults, the tail is sharp when young but grows blunt with age. This snake is viviparous ; nineteen young, each about eight inches long, were taken from the belly of one about two-and-a-half feet long brought me at Combaconum. (rn.) Eryx Johnii, (page 103,) called jgfjs&oofi/f.uar, Irutaiei (two head) viriyan ; this is like a large earth-worm in color ; its tail looks as though the end had been chopped off, a patch ol"], [902, "XXXVI reddish-brown , darker than the rest of the body, covers the tip looking like a lately cicatrised wound ; natives believe its head and tail change places every six months. Poisonous Snakes. Four kinds of poisonous snakes are found in Tanjore \u2014 the Cobra, the Bangarus arcuatus, tbe Chain Viper and the Carpet Viper. The deadly nature of the Cobra's poison is well known ; the Chain Viper has longer fangs with a larger duct, and as powerful a poison. Dr. Shortt tells me that the Bungarus is as fatal as the Cobra, while the little Carpet Viper kills almost as surely though less rapidly than its larger congeners ; these are all mentioned in Board's Proceedings, 4th January 1872, No. 11. (n.) Naga tripudians, the binocellate Cobra, the spectacled Cobra, (page 105,) is called ibusld, Nagam, or iseneouniin-j, Nalla pambu. In the list submitted by the Tahsildars a number of varieties are mentioned depending on certain marks ; they are divided by the natives into castes \u2014 Brahmins, Rajahs, Shettis, Pariahs, etc. (o.) Bungarus arcuatus, (page 107,) the white-arched Bun garus, the krait is called asmi\u2014iiis(T^aike3st>, Kandam karuvazalei and sfl/flujOT, viriyan (called in other districts Lf&rQziinfiunujLi, Punneri pambu). It has a white belly and black back with thin white arches across the back ; these arches are not continuous but consist of white spots, nor are they at regular intervals, nor straight across the back but incline backwards and forwards. The arches are generally absent behind the head and for some distance down the forepart of the body. Dr. Short tells me that the B. fasciatus, the yellow-banded Bungarus (of which he showed me a fine lively specimen) which is found in Burmah and the Northern Circars, does not come south of Madras. .1 have never seen it in Tanjore. (^3.) Baboia elegans or Russelli, the Chain Viper, Russel's Viper, Tic polonga of Ceylon, Cobra Manilla of the Portuguese (page 116, see also page 11, plate II. , figure 3, page 8, for des cription of its poison apparatus). This snake is very common about Combaconum and Mayaveram, almost as much so as the Cobra ; once known it cannot be mistaken ; the three rows of oval brown spots darker than the ground pattern and edged with a black rim with a white rim outside (several spots are sometimes joined together forming a long line) shaped like the links of a chain, or the glasses of spectacles, being unlike the"], [903, "XXXVII markings of any other snake ; in its stoutness it resembles the Python, but the spots on the latter are irregular quadrilaterals, not ovals. Its native names are \u00c6sw-^ptf__l(fl_yOT) Kannadi viriyan (\u00ab\u00absiT(eOT)if , a spectacle glass) given to young specimens when the black and white rims are most distinct ; they fade with age; Qu^eSSiueir, Peru viriyan, peru, large; anaQS^iBiusn, Sangili (chain) viriyan ; gfiiipps&iflajssr, Iratta (blood) viriyan (not p0/s.

Perukannadi and Kajuthei viriyan are the commonest of these names, the latter name being given to the oldest and largest individuals. (q.)

APPENDIX C. THE CUSTOM OF \" KAREIYID\" OR PERIODICAL REDISTRIBUTION OF LAND IN TANJORE. BY H. J. STOKES, C.S., NEGAPATAM. In 1807 a Committee appointed to report on the project of making a permanent settlement in Tanjore found that there were three classes of villages in the district, which were named accord ing to the tenure on which they were held. These were \u2014 1. Samudayam, of which there were 1,774 2. Palabhogam, of which there were 2,202 3. Ekabhogam, of which there were 1,807 Total villages 5,783 We are not now concerned with the two latter, which are villages the lauds of which are possessed by several or by one holder, but need only speak of the Samudayam holdings. This class, which I conceive to be the most primitive, must be sub divided into two, namely, those villages in which the produce of the land was divided, and those in which the land itself was tem porarily apportioned. The word Samudayam is Sanskrit, and means \" common.\" The villages to which this term specially applies are those in which the members of the community, or Mirasdars as they are now styled, cultivate the lands in common, and divide the produce, according to each man's p a n g u or share. That is, there are no separate allotments of land to individuals, and the property was a right to a certain share or a number of shares in the produce. In such villages each holder possessed his proportion of the common stock, and contributed his share of the labour. The only separate land he could hold was the garden or backward attached to his house,"], [905, "SXZ1X and situated within the limits of the village-aite. There are hardly any villages now remaining in which this tenure still exists, and it will doubtless soon die out. There are, however, lands in many villages, generally waste or inferior fields, of which the cultivation is precarious, which are called \" Samudayam,\" and held and tilled in common by the landholders \u25a0 they are such lands as it was expedient to hold in common, or such as were not worth dividing, and in them the ancient tenure, which was probably at one time universal, is found to survive. But as under this system there is little encouragement to indi- vidual industry, and as therefore the cultivation is slovenly and the yield poor, there inevitably arises the necessity for the next step in agricultural improvement, namely, that of allotting to each shareholder in the village a certain portion of land to cul- tivate. A village in which this arrangement has taken place is called in Tamil a \" Pa s u n-K ar ei,\" or\"Kareiyi d\" village. The word pasun is an old Tamil word cognate with the Kanarese vevhpasu, 'to divide;' and both names mean \" Field-division.\" At first the allotment was probably made anew each year ; at least such would be the natural commencement of the change, and we find that such was actually the case in some of the richest vil- lages in what used to be called the J a g h i r, and is now the Chingalpat district around Madras ;* but in Tanjore I am unaware of any instances being known where the changes were so frequent. The periods usual in this district vary from eight to thirty years, according to the pleasure of the Mirasdars. The manner in which the redistribution of lands takes place will best be described by an example. In a village, say, of twenty velis (lvSM\u20146'6 acres), a certain unit is fixed on which is called a p a n g u or ' share,' and is in some villages 1 veli, and in others varies from ly to 3 velis. The village is divided, accord ing to its extent, into from fonr to ten \"Kareis\" or blocks, to each of which so many shares are allotted. Thus in a village of 20 velis, there might be 15 shares apportioned to 4 blocks of land among 12 shareholders, each block containing the land of three shareholders. In the month of June, July, or August, before the seed is sown, the operation of division, or \" kareiyid \" commences. First of all, the whole area of the village is measured, and a mea surement account prepared. Then for each karei (block) a head- * Papers on Mir&si right, edited by W- Hudleston, p. 67."], [906, "XL man is chosen from among the landholders, who is known as the *Karei Kar an, or Kareisvami, the manager or master of the k ar ei. He is generally one of the largest shareholders in the village ; though nowadays if he cannot read and write, the larger holder is passed over in favour of the smaller who can. He is appointed by the common consent of the sharers who are allotted to the k a re i of which he is to be the head, and retains his position until the next division takes place. If he die before that time, or sell his property, his office does not pass by inheri tance nor to the purchaser. No new appointment is made ; and the name of the original karei karanis attached to the k a r e i throughout the time during which the distribution of the land is to remain in force. When he has been chosen, and when certain shareholders have been allotted to each k a r e i, an agree ment is executed by them to abide by the karei karan and the allotment, and binding themselves to execute the necessary repairs and improvements, and to carry out certain other usual arrangements. Then the lands of the village are divided, without reference to previous enjoyment, into so many shares, 15 in the case we have taken ; these again are embodied in 4 k a r e i s. Then a slip of kadjan (palm-leaf), called \" kareiyolei,\" is prepared for each of the four k a r e i s, and on it are written the names and extent of the fields composing the karei. Four other smaller slips are inscribed with the names of the karei k a r a n s, each bearing one name ; and then all the eight slips are thrown down together on the ground. A child of four or five years old, who cannot read, is sent to pick out a large and a small slip, and this decides the karei and the karei karan. The lots are drawn in some public place, either before the tem ple, or at the math, or at the village choultry. An auspicious day, chosen according to the position of the star of the villages (which is determined by the first letter of its name), is appointed for the allotment ; and the proceedings are to some extent of a religious character. If the drawing takes place at a temple, it is done in the presence of the deity ; or if elsewhere, a new figure of the favourite village god Pilleiyar is made with saffron powder ; as many cocoanuts are broken before it as there are m i r a s d ar s in the village, and after betel has been presented, and worship is over, the drawing of the lots takes place. After the lottery the slips of kadjan are deposited with the karei * Also called Kareisvan or Sh et ti karan; the latter name being obviously from the Hindi \"Shet,\" Sans. \" Kshetra. '"], [907, "XLI k a, r a n s ; and the agreement executed by the shareholders, and measurement-account, are entrusted to the village priest, or schoolmaster, or astrologer, who is supposed to be a common friend to all parties. To make matters more secure, each m i r a s dar (shareholder) can have a copy of these documents for himself. Within a week or so of this ceromony, which is properly the k a r e i y i d, each karei k a, r a n divides the lands of the block which has fallen to him among the mirasdars who have agreed to abide by him. This division is made either by the same process of casting lots, or by common consent. It need not be conducted in any particular place, nor it is attended with any ceremony. Each mirasdar receives, and keeps by nim, a slip of kadjan on which his lands are entered. In order to place more clearly before readers who care to exa mine the subject closely the details of the working of this k a r e i y i d tenure, I \"hall here introduce a translation of a k a r e i y i d agreement. This document is one of those above men tioned which are executed by the mirasdars before the lots are drawn. \" This is the agreement which we Devayyan and others, the undersigned mirasdars of the village of Nannilam, have made with one consent on the 22nd of A. n i in the year Raktakshi [4th July 1864]. \"All the mirasdars*of the pangus (shares), nino in num ber, of the above village, have enjoyed the n a, n j c i (wet) lands, etc., in the village by dividing them according to k a r e i y i d, without achandrarka m.f They have agreed with Govern ment some years ago for ' amani ' management, some years on the estimate system, and some years for grain or money rents- From the Prabhava (year) before last to Ishvara (11 years), a kareiyid of nine k a r e i s (was in force).

But there was great loss, as, by reason of the lands being (split up) into various little holdings, the customary re pairs by the villagers, and the construction of banks (were neg lected), nnd. the dams and boundaries were not repaired; the channels and sub-channels were not properly cleared ; and no matter how much manure or leaves were put on the nanjei (wet) fields, it did no good to the crop. The mirasdars were for the most part badly off, and suffered hardship and distress. So, having considered the necessity of obtaining ordinary pros perity without the recurrence of such (misfortunes), and of the Government revenue being paid without the least trouble or de ficiency ; and whereas now in this present year the time has come for making kareiyid, we have essayed to make a kareiyid for a long period, and in accordance with the division now pre vailing. Towards that end we have made a petition in the taluk that the necessary assistance may be granted, and all the mirasdars have voluntarily assembled in the presence of the Tasildar, and have asked him. Besides the undersigned, (who form) the majority of the mirasdars, Kanagasabhei Chetti, Appu Chetti, Rama-Sami Chetti, and Vengappayyan who has obtained land from the miras darChinnaKishnayyan on tenancy, these four persons' only owning -|-\u00a7th of a p a n g u (share) , refuse to act in concert with all in the village.

In default of this, they will not agree to make kareiyid, and will keep the same lands as they have held hitherto. And whereas permission has been given for all the mirasdars who are willing to unite and make a k a r e i y i d, all the mirasdars who have signed this have united, and, with a view to the proper execution of the customary repairs above spe cified in order that prosperity may be attained, have measured and classified the low-and high-level and other lands ; and excluding the low-assessed service lands, which are held by right of pur chase, and the lands shown in the account as set apart for tem ples, Brahmans, artisans, and others, as entered in the former"], [909, "xliii agreement, and enjoyed by the several persons and institutions from the time of their ancestors, have classified such of the re maining lands as arc n a n j e i (wet), and have allotted the shares p a n g u s in four k a r e i s.

It points, too, to the causes which lead gradually to the abandonment of the system. These are the neglect of banks, channels, and other repairs and improve ments, owing to the short and uncertain tenure each cultivator has of his land ; and the intrusion of outsiders into the commu nity. It will be observed from the names, that three of the landholders who refused to consent to the proposed redistribu tion were C h e 1 1 i s, that is, tradesmen ; and they may be pre sumed to have acquired their portions of the village from persons to whom they had advanced money. These outsiders would have no respect for the customs of the village, and little sympa thy with the community into which they had thrust themselves.
