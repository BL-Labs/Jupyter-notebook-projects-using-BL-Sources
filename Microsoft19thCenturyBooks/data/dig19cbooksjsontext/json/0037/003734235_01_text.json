Goodrich, of the said district, has deposited in this office the title of a book, the right whereof he claims as proprietor, in the words following, to tint -\u25a0 \"A Geographical View of the United States.\" In conformity to the act of the Congress of the United States, entitled, \"An Act for the encouragement of learning, by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein mentioned jM and also to an act, entitled, \"An Act supplementary to an act, entitled, An Act for the encour agement of learning, by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times thesein mentioned ; and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of designing, engraving, and etching historical and other prmts \" JNO. W. DAVIS, CUrTc qf the District of Massachusetts."], [9, "A GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW OF THE UNITED STATES EXTENT AND BOUNDARIES. The territory claimed by the United States extends from the 25th to the 49th parallel of north latitude, and from the 67th to the 124th degree of east longitude from London. Its extreme length, from the Pacific Ocean to Passamaquoddy Bay, is 2780 English miles ; its greatest breadth, from the shore of Louis iana to the River La Pluie, is 1300 miles ; and its area about 2,300,000 square miles. On the east, it is bounded by the At lantic Ocean. On the north-east, a conventional line divides it from New Brunswick, extending from Passamaquoddy Bay northward to the 48th parallel, embracing the head waters of the River St. John ; of part of which tract, however, the British dispute the right of possession. From this extreme northern point, the boundary line passes along the ridge of mountains south-westward to the 45th parallel, and then along this parallel till it strikes the St. Lawrence 120 miles below Lake Ontario. It then follows the river and chain of Lakes Erie. St. Clair, Huron, and Superior, proceeding from the last by the course of the River La Pluie to the 95th degree of west longitude, from which point it passes along the 49th parallel to the Rocky Mountains. On the west side of the mountains, the Americans have an unquestioned claim to the country from the 42d to the 49th parallel ; and a more doubtful claim, which is disputed by Russia, to the country from the 49th to the 60th parallel. On the south, the territories of the republic are bounded by the Gulf of Mexico ; and on the south-west, the boundary ex tends, in a zigzag-line, from the mouth ofthe River Sabine to a point in the Rocky Mountains, in north latitude .42\u00b0, and in west longitude 108\u00b0, from which it passes along the 42d parallel to the Pacific Ocean. The Mississippi divides into two parts, very nearly equal, this vast region, which greatly surpasses in extent the Macedonian, Roman, or Chinese empires. GOVERNMENT. The government of the United States, local and general, grew naturally out of the old colonial charters, which were bounded on the constitutional law of England. The principles,"], [10, "4 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW therefore, of those harmonious and beautiful republican institu tions, of which America is justly proud, are the patrimonial gist of England ; but it cannot be denied that the wisdom of Ameri can statesmen, and the free spirit of the people, have devel oped these principles more fully, raised those institutions to a degree hitherto unexampled, and realized a system of polity more economical, orderly, and rational, and more conducive to human improvement, to national prosperity and happiness, than any that has yet existed in the world. It affords, indeed, an encouraging view of the future fortunes of mankind, to observe how much more surely men are conducted to sound conclu sions, on all questions of practical importance, by the general progress of knowledge, and the instinct of self-interest operat ing in society at large, than by the speculations of the philoso pher. Plato, Sir Thomas More, Harrington, and Hume, have all exerted their ingenuity in framing a plan for a perfect com monwealth, in which the fullest measure of liberty should be conjoined with order, justice, and good government, and pure morality in private life. But what they looked upon almost as an ideal good, rather to be desired than hoped for, and what they merely endeavoured to approach to, by an apparatus the most refined and complicated, by institutions calculated to force nature, and by impracticable schemes of moral discipline, has been realized, to an extent far beyond their hopes, by mecha/ nism infinitely more simple and natural than what they propos ed, and infinitely more certain and constant in its operation. The legislative power in the United States is separated into two branches, and the government is therefore two-fold. To the state government is committed that branch which relates to the regulation of internal concerns. These bodies make and alter the laws which regard property and private rights, regu late the police, appoint the judges and civil officers, impose taxes for state purposes, and exercise all other rights and powers not vested in the federal government by positive enact ment. To the federal government belongs the power of making peace and war with foreign nations, raising and supporting an army and navy, fixing the organization of the militia, imposing taxes for the common defence or benefit of the Union, borrow ing money, coining money, fixing the standard of weights and measures, establishing post offices and post roads, granting pat ents for inventions, and exclusive copyrights to authors, regu lating commerce with foreign nations, establishing uniform bankrupt laws, and a uniform rule of naturalization, and, lastly, the federal tribunals judge of felonies and piracies committed on the high seas, of offences against the law of nations, and of questions between the citizens of different states. It is re markable that, though the powers ofthe federal and local gov ernments necessarily interfere in some points, it is verjyare that any contest or collision has arisen out of this circumstance. The foundation of this harmony obviously is, that both congress and the state legislatures are merely the organs of the saine>"], [11, "OF THE UNITED STATES. 5 universal interest, \u2014 that ofthe people, \u2014 and have no independent existence. Were the power in both cases in the hands of oli garchies, vvho-held it in despite ofthe people, and for their pri vate emolument, there would be quarrels and disputes in abun dance. In the United States, the sovereignty resides not figurative ly, but really, in the mass of the people. Prom them all power emanates, and to them the highest functionary, as well as the lowest, feels that he is amenable for his acts. The humblest individual assists by delegation in forming the laws under which he lives, disposes by his vote .of the highest office in the state, and may obtain it himself if he can gain the confidence of his fellow-citizens. The people at large are daily in the exercise of political functions,- and every one, who holds a place of trust, derives his authority either directly from popular suffrage, or from persons who owe their power to the people's choice, and are responsible to them for the use they make of it. Some thing approaching to this, in a distant degree, may be found in the British constitution; but it may be safely said, that the American government is the first which has ever been fairly bottomed on the broad principle of the sovereignty of the people. In the earlier constitutions of several of the states, the right of suffrage was confined to persons possessing freeholds, or some small property ; but experience seems to have decided in favour of a broader principle. In the new states, the right of suffrage may be described as universal, being extended to all who pay taxes, (slaves excepted ;) and in the amended constitu tions of most of the old states, tbe same rule has been adopted. The mode of voting at elections is generally by ballot. The federal government of the United States consists of a president, a senate, and a house of representatives. The presi dent is chosen for four years, by delegates elected for this pur pose by the people, and equal in number, for each state, to the members it sends to congress. The vice-president is elected in the same mannerj and for the same period ; but both are gen erally elected for four years more, and so serve eight years. The president is commander-in-chief of the army and navy, and of the militia when in active service. He grants reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment. With the advice and concurrence of the senate, he makes treaties, nominates ambassadors, consuls and judges; and he appoints several other officers by his own au thority. He must be a native born citizen, not under thirty-five years of age, and he receives a salary of 25,000 dollars per annum. The senate consists of forty-eight members, namely, two for eacjj state, who are chosen, not by the people, but by the legis latures of the several states, and hold their offices for six years, one third of the members being removed every two years. A senator must be thirty years of age, an inhabitant of the state 1*"], [12, "6 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW for which he is chosen, and he must have been a citizen of the United States for nine years. The house of representatives consists of 212 members, (1824,) who are chosen for two years, by the persons who elect the corresponding branches of the state legislatures, that is, with some few exceptions, by the mass of the adult population. The representatives are distributed among the states, in the propor tion of one for every 40,000 inhabitants, excluding the Indians, and two-fifths of the people of colour. Even free persons of colour, however, have no vote, except in one or two states. A representative must be twenty-five years of age, an inhabitant ofthe state for which he is chosen, and he must have been a citizen of the United States for seven years. Senators and representatives receive an allowance of eight dollars per day for the time they attend the session of congress, and eight dol lars of travelling charges, for every twenty miles they have to travel in going and returning. Members of congress take an oath to support the constitution, but no religious test is re quired from them or any person holding office under the federal government. Senators and representatives vacate their places if they accept of an office under government, and are not re eligible while they hold it. - . COURTS AND LAWS. The federal judiciary consists of a supreme court, which sits at Washington, and a district court in each state, in which one judge sits. In the supreme court there is a chief judge and six associate judges, who hold their office during good be haviour. This court has original jurisdiction in all cases af fecting ambassadors and consuls, and those in which a state is a party. It has appellate jurisdiction in all cases arising' under the federal constitution, in all admiralty cases, in controversies between two states, or two citizens of different states, and be tween a state or citizens thereof, and foreign states or subjects. The supreme court, deriving its authority from the constitu tion, exercises a power not enjoyed by the inferior courts. It has refused to give effect to, and by that means has virtually annulled several acts ofthe state legislatures, .and even of con gress itself, on the ground that these acts, by \" impairing the obligation of contracts,\" violated a rule made binding by the constitution' on legislative bodies. The federal judges are ap pointed by the executive, with the approbation of the senate. In this and the other federal courts, jurors and witnesses are allowed one dollar twenty-five cents per day, and five cents per mile of travelling charges. The basis of the system of law in the United States is the common law of England, modified by acts of the general and state governments, which constitute the written law ; and the works not only of. Coke and Blackstone, but of the most recent English writers, and even the latest Term Reports, are familiarly cited in the courts. The circuit courts do the most important part of the business"], [13, "7 OF THE UNITED STATES* in the national courts, their jurisdiction comprehending all civil cases exceeding 500 dollars in value, as well as criminal cases. They sit twice in a year in each state, and are composed of a district judge and one ofthe judges ofthe supreme court. But either ofthe two judges may sit alone, if the other be absent. RELIGION. It was reserved for the lawgivers of the United States to make the bold experiment of dispensing with a state religion. In New Hampshire the legislature is empowered to authorize, and in Massachusetts the legislature is enjoined to require the several towns and parishes to make adequate provision, at their own expense, for the support of Protestant ministers. But in all the other twenty-two states, the support of religion is left en tirely to the voluntary zeal of its professors. The result has shown that Christianity has a firm hold in the nature of man, and is rather injured than served by those costly establishments, which so often extinguish or abridge free inquiry or liberty of conscience, engender fierce animosities among rival sects, per petuate the errors and dogmas of unenlightened times, and de grade religion into an empire of civil tyranny, or the ally of ignorance or imposture. In the large towns and populous places of New England, New York and Pennsylvania, religious in struction is more faithfully and abundantly dispensed, and reli gious ordinances are more strictly and universally observed, than in any other country in the world. To this advantage we may add that of the peace and harmony that reigns among the different religious communities, and the entire absence of those jealousies, bickerings and heart burnings, which the exaltation of a single sect so invariably creates. In the new-settled dis tricts, where a small population is spread over a wide surface, the means of religious instruction are often deficient, and must be so, even were the wealth of an establishment expended in providing for them. The most numerous sects are the Congregationalists, or In dependents, Baptists and Methodists. The Congregationalists abound chiefly in New England, and have about 1200 congre gations. The Baptists, who are most numerous in the Middle, Southern and Western States, had 2727 churches in 1817, and have now about 3000 ; but as their congregations in New Eng land are estimated by Dr. Morse only at 250 persons each, while those of the Congregationalists average about 1000, the latter are probably more numerous upon the whole. The Methodists, who abound most in the Southern and Western States, have about 2000 congregations, and display a very active proselyting spirit. The Presbyterians, whose principal strength lies in the Middle States, have about 900 congregations, which are classed into presbyteries and synods. The Associate Reformed or American Burghers, have about 100 churches, and the Asso ciate Synod, or Anti-burghers, about 50; but there is a ten-"], [14, "8 \u2022 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW dency in both these sects to coalesce with the Presbyterians. The Dutch Reformed Church, confined to New York and New Jersey, has about 200 churches. The Episcopalians had 600 churches, and 346 clergymen, in 1822, chiefly in the Middle and Southern States. They are governed by a convention consist ing of two houses. The Catholics, who are not numerous any where but in Maryland, are estimated by Dr. Morse to amount to 75,000. The Quakers have about 190 congregations, chiefly in the Middle States. The Moravians, Universalists, Hunno nists, Cameronians, and other sects, have each a few churches ; and the Jews have synagogues at New York, Newport, Phila delphia, Charleston and Savannah. The whole number of churches, or religious societies, in the United States, is probably not under 900, or one for each 11,000 inhabitants. The duties of a clergyman in the United States are labo rious, and in a part the pay arises from pew rents and voluntary contributions, sometimes from small glebes, fixed funds, or land. It is seldom so large as to prove a temptation to the worldly minded ; but it is generally sufficient to support the clergymen respectably. For slender emoluments, the Americans secure the services of a body of moral, faithful, diligent and well-edu cated clergymen. DIVISIONS. The American Federation embraces at present (1827) twenty four distinct states, each ruled by its own government ; three territories, in which civil governments are established without constitutions ; and three other territories, yet unoccupied by a civilized population. If we attend to the distinctions which exist in these various states and territories, founded on their physical circumstances, or the pursuits and character of the people, we may class them into four grand groups : First, New England, embracing the six states east of the Hudson. Second, the Middle State's, in cluding New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, in which the agricultural character is united with, and qualified by the commercial. Thirdly, the Southern States, including Virginia and all the maritime country to the Missis sippi, where the amount of commerce is comparatively small, where slaves are numerous, and the husbandmen are generally planters. Fourth, the Western States, in the basin of the Ohio, enjoying tbe best soil and climate in the United States, where there are few slaves, and where the character of the people is almost purely agricultural. A parallelogram, 60 miles in breadth, extending westerly from the Delaware to the Susquehannah, 70 miles, is by far the most densely peopled portion of the United States, and is equally prominent for its wealth, its agriculture, manufactures, and do mestic commerce."], [15, "9 OF THE UNITED STATES. POPULATION. The population of the United States, in 1790, was 3,929,326 ; in 1800, 5,305,666 ; in 1810, 7,239,903 ; and in 1820, 9,625,734 ; of whom 1,531,436 were slaves, and 233,398 free blacks. The population increases very regularly at tbe rate of about 3 per cent, per annum, doubling in less than 25 years. The inhabi tants consist of whites, negroes and Indians. The negroes are generally slaves, and are principally confined to the states south of Pennsylvania and the River Ohio. All the whites are of Eu ropean origin ; principally English. The New Englanders, Vir ginians and Carolinians are almost purely English. Next to the English are the Germans, who are very numerous in the Middle States, particularly Pennsylvania. Next to the Germans are the Dutch, who are most numerous in New York. The French constitute nearly half of the population of Louisiana. The Irish and Scotch are found in tbe Middle States, in the back parts of Virginia, and in all the principal cities in the Union. Very little is known about the Indians west of the Mississippi. The four principal tribes on the east of the Mis sissippi are the Creeks, Choctaws, Cherokees and Chickasaws. These tribes live within the chartered limits of Georgia, Ala bama, Mississippi and Tennessee. LANGUAGES. The English language is almost universally spoken. All records are kept in it throughout the country, and all puhlic business transacted. The German, Dutch, Swedish, Irish, Welsh and French are spoken more or less, and in all of them public worship is in some place or other regularly performed. The German is spoken very extensively in Pennsylvania, and in parts of New York. Dutch is spoken by numbers in New York and New Jersey, and by a few in Pennsylvania. Swedish is spoken by a few in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. The Irish, in and near Philadelphia, and the interior of Penn sylvania, in considerable numbers, retain their native language. A- few Welsh settlements are scattered over the Middle States. French and Spanish, the former more generally, are taught in the large towns, and spoken, as their vernacular dialect by many occasional residents, and by a few of the settled inhabi tants. The English of the Middle States, owing to the influx of for eigners, is generally less pure than that of the Northern or Southern States. The pronunciation of English gentlemen, where it has not been corrupted by the stage, differs imper ceptibly from the pronunciation of New England. LITERATURE. The growth of a native literature in the United States has been impeded by several causes. First, the number of well educated persons, living in idleness, who cultivate taste, and en-"], [16, "10 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW courage its cultivation in others, is comparatively small. Sec ondly, the universal addiction to gainful pursuits, and the striking success which repays them, dishearten persons from engaging in occupations that do not afford emolument. But, thirdly, by far the greater impediment is the existence of the more advanced literature of England, in the very language of the country. Though the political connexion has ceased, the United States, in what regards literature, may, perhaps, be con sidered nearly as much a province of Britain as Yorkshire or Ireland. So long as British writers furnish the standard by which transatlantic works are tried, native American writers will not receive justice ; and while American publishers can im port and reprint, without risk or expense, works already stamp ed with the approbation of British critics, and the British pub lic, they will feel the less inclined to engage in the doubtful and hazardous speculation of publishing the original products of American genius. Besides, the appetite for knowledge, and tlie sort of amusement which reading affords, like the desire for clothes and luxuries, requires a certain, and only a certain supply ; and in the one case, as in the other, when the article can be cheaply imported, the native manufacture is discouraged. America, however, is rapidly acquiring a literature of her own ; and the productions of her press already begin to attract atten tion in Europe. In one department of literature, of an humble, indeed, but most useful description, the United States stand unrivalled. We al lude to their periodical and newspaper press. There were but seven papers published in the United States in 1750 ; but in 1810, there were 359, including 25 published daily, w7hich cir culated 22,200,000 copies in the year. In 1823 they had in creased to the* astonishing number of 598, and the number of copies circulated in the year by these journals probably exceeds thirty millions. In the British Isles, in 1821, with twenty mil lions of people, the number of newspapers was estimated to be 284, and the copies printed annually, 23,600,000. The whole of continental Europe, containing 160 millions of inhabitants^ where the press is chained down by royal and priestly jealousy, certainly does not support half the number of journals which exist in the United States alone. They are superficial observers, who attach a small importance to this humble branch of litera ture. Though, perhaps, none ofthe American papers equal the best of those published in London, the periodical press of the United States, taken altogether, is tho most powerful engine for diffusing mercantile, political and general information, for stimulating activity, and acting on the minds and morals of the people, which has ever existed in any country. No duty is paid, either on the papers themselves, or on the advertisements they publish, and they are circulated with immense rapidity, and at a trifling expense for transportation, to every portion of the Union."], [17, "OF THE UNITED STATES. 11 COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. There are about thirty colleges or universities in the United States, of which Harvard and Yale are the most celebrated ; but most of these are less perfect than the kindred establish ments in Europe ; and classical and scientific education is ge nerally in a much lower state. Harvard University, in Massa chusetts, has fifteen literary, and six medical professors, and generally from 300 to 400 students. The three terms amount to nine months in a year, and the vacations to three ; the aca demical course is completed in four years. Among the theolo gians of this university, Socinianism is almost universally preva lent. \u2014 Yale College, in Connecticut, is less richly endowed than Harvard, but enjoys an equal reputation. The faculty consists of a president, nine professors, four medical examiners, and six tutors. The students, except those whose parents live in the town, board within the college. At this seminary the advan tages of the English and Scottish systems are, to a considerable extent, combined. The scope for original discussion and ele gance of illustration, which lecturing affords, is connected with the more laborious and effective discipline of tutors and exami nations : the students are not considered as passive recipi ents of know-ledge, but are stimulated to the active exercise of their own powers. All the classes are subjected to a rigorous examination twice a year ; and these examinations, w7ith the numerous exercises prescribed, and tbe severe discipline en forced, drive away the laggard and disorderly members, and ensure a respectable proficiency in those who receive degrees at the end of the fourth year. This college had 412 students in 1820. Most of the other universities and colleges are or ganized on the same principles. RELIGIOUS AND BENEVOLENT SOCIETIES. The principal religious and benevolent societies are, the American Bible Society, whose sole object is to publish and cir culate the Bible without note or comment ; \u2014 the American Colo nization Society, whose object is to colonize the free people of colour of the United States ; (a colony has already been plant ed on the west coast of Africa, south of Sierra Leone ;) \u2014 the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, whose object is to convert the heathen to Christianity, and who have missionary stations and missionaries, at Bombay and Cey lon, in India ; in Palestine ; at the Sandwich Islands ; and among the Cherokee and Choctaw Indians in the United States ; \u2014 the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions, who have missionaries in the Bin.ian empire, and among the American Indians ; \u2014 the American Tract Society, whose object is to distribute religious tracts in the United States and foreign countries ; \u2014 the Ameri can Sabbath- School Union, designed to assist in the establish ment of Sabbath schools on the most approved plan. There are"], [18, "12 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW education societies among the Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Baptists, designed to assist indigent young men in prepar ing for the Christian ministry. The American Bible Society and the American Tract Society have their seat in New York, the American and Baptist Boards of Foreign Missions in Bos ton, the Colonization Society in Washington, the Sunday School Union in Philadelphia. In 1816 an Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb was established at Hartford, Connecticut, under the pa tronage of the United States government, and is a very useful and flourishing institution. CANALS EXECUTED AND PROJECTED. The principal canals in the United States are, 1. the Middle sex Canal, which connects Merrimac River with Boston har bour ; \u2014 2. the Champlain Canal, which connects Lake Cham plain with the Hudson ; \u2014 3. the Erie Canal, connecting Lake Erie with the Hudson ; \u2014 4. the canal which connects Chesa peake Bay with Albemarle Sound ; \u2014 5. the Santee Canal, which connects Santee River with Charleston harbour. The first of these canals brings the trade of the interior of New Hampshire to Boston. The second will bring that of the coun try oft Lake Champlain to the city of New York. The third will bring that of a large section of the western country to the same city. The fourth brings that of the north-eastern part of North Carolina to Norfolk. The fifth brings the trade of the western part of North Carolina to the city of Charleston. The most important canals now in progress, but not yet exe cuted, are, 1. the Farmington Canal, which is to connect the Connecticut River at Northampton with New Haven harbour in Connecticut ; \u2014 2. the Hudson and Delaware Canal, which com mences near Kingston, on the Hudson, and is to proceed in a south-easterly direction to the Delaware ; \u2014 3. Union Canal, which unites the Schuylkill, at Reading, with the Susquehan nah, below Harrisburgh ; \u2014 4. Chesapeake and Delaware, Canal, across the isthmus which separates the Chesapeake and Dela ware Bays ; \u2014 5. Louisville and Portland Canal, around the Falls ofthe Ohio at Louisville; \u2014 6. Ohio and Erie Canal, from the Ohio, at the mouth of the Scioto, to Cleaveland on Lake Erie ; \u2014 7. Miami Canal, from Dayton on the Miami River to Cin cinnati. The principal canals seriously contemplated, but not yet commenced, are, 1. a canal from the Raritan River to the Del aware, through which sloops may pass from New York to Phil adelphia ;\u2014 2. a canal around the Falls of Niagara, through which sloops may pass Lake Erie to Lake Ontario; \u2014 3. the Florida canal, across the northern part of Florida, from the At lantic to the Gulf of Mexico, by which sloops will avoid the long and dangerous navigation around the peninsula ; \u2014 4. a canal for boats from the tide waters ofthe Chesapeake to Lake, Erie ; \u2014 5. a canal from Lake Michigan to Illinois River."], [19, "OF THE UNITED STATES. 13 RAIL ROADS EXECUTED AND PROJECTED. Little is yet known of rail roads in America ; but the enter prising spirit of the people has led them to engage in the pro ject of thus uniting distant portions of their country. A company has been chartered to construct a rail road from Baltimore to the Ohio, a distance of two hundred and fifty miles, and surmounting an elevation of three thousand feet. There is also a rail road projected from Boston across the country to Albany, thus uniting those important cities, and giv ing a more ready communication between the metropolis of New England and the greatest commercial city on this side the Atlantic. NATIONAL ROADS. Probably no people ever made so many improvements in roads, bridges and canals, over such an extent of country, in the same time, as the United States. Two centuries ago, the whole tract was a wilderness, covered over with forests, and traversed only by the footpaths ofthe Indians. Now, there are roads constructed in every direction, to connect the villages, towns and cities, which have sprung up in rapid succession. In 1790 the extent of post roads was only 1875 miles ; in 1818 it was 51,600. The numbe of post offices exceeds 4000, and the mail is transported 20,000 miles daily. To describe ail our roads would require an enu meration of all the principal settlements in the country. A large number are public roads, constructed and supported by the towns through which they pass ; but the great roads are generally turnpikes, constructed by the state or incorporate bodies, and supported by tolls. The most important post road of the United States is that which traverses the states on the Atlantic, a distance of 180C miles, passing through all the. principal towns, from Robbins town in Maine to Florida. The principal roads from the Atlan tic to the Western States, are the great western turnpike of New York, from Albany to Buffalo and Erie ; the road from Philadelphia, through Lancaster, to Pittsburgh ; and the Cum berland road, from Washington city to Wneeling, on the Ohio River. The latter was constructed at the expense of the gene ral government, and is probably the best road over the moun tains. Other roads, of\" less importance, cross the Alleghany Ridge in Virginia and North Carolina ; and the state of South Carolina has recently opened a road across the mountains to Tennessee. A military road has been opened by General Jack son, at the expense of the United States, from Nashville in Tennessee to Madisonville on Lake Pontchartrain, opposite to New Orleans. It may be travelled by wagons. A branch leads from this road to Natchez, through the wilderness inhabit ed by the Choctaw Indians. 2"], [20, "14 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW SOCIETY, MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. Society, manners and customs differ so much in different parts of the United States, that no general description would be ap plicable to the whole. Indeed, one might almost as well attempt to include in any general description the various countries of Europe as the United States of America ; for although a uniform system of government produces many prominent features of a common character in all the members of this great confedera tion, yet the wide range of climate embraced by its limits, the great variety of habits, objects and feelings, and especially of political and religious sentiments, which prevailed among the first settlers of these several states, the diversified pursuits and occupations of the present inhabitants, the admission and pro scription of slavery, and a thousand other circumstances, have contributed to establish the most marked distinctions, and often to present the most striking contrasts, between the several sec tions of the Union. The government is of the several states and of the Union are elective and popular. Every officer and ma gistrate is appointed, directly or indirectly, by the people. They pass every law, propose every measure, form every treaty, and dispose of all public property, by themselves or by those whom they elect to office. The effect of this state of things'on public men has been, on the one hand, to check the pride of place and the insolence of office ; and, on the other, to persuade many of them to calumny, flattery, intrigue and falsehood,. Its effect on the community at large has been to inspire, on the one hand, a high sense of personal independence, and a jealous care of national freedom; and, on the other, to impair the necessary distinctions in society, and put all men on a level ; to give im portance to mere numbers, and take it away from intelligence and worth ; to. show us, in a word, that there is no perfection under the sun. In the Eastern States, property is more equally distributed than in any other country. Religion, here, also, except in Rhode Island, is, and always has been, supported by law. At present, not far from 2000 clergymen, generally well informed and orthodox, and all chosen by the people themselves, are weekly and daily employed in enlightening and informing their congregations. Schools are established within every little dis tance,'and a grown person, a native of these states, can scarcely be found, who has not some acquaintance with reading, writing and arithmetic. The inhabitants universally live in villao-es or towns of a moderate she, and have no overgrown capital, in which to learn profligacy of manners. The great body of them are farmers. These circumstances have given these states very much the manners and morals of Scotland. In the Middle States, religion is not supported by law, and there are fewer clergymen in proportion to the population. Schools are not as numerous), or as well directed, and a.consid ejruo.e uuir.rr.- ..*\" tlie inhabitants are' unable to read or write."], [21, "OF THE UNITED STATES. 15 Property is less equally distributed ; and the people are more divided, as in Europe, into rich and poor. Extensive tracts have been lately settled, and still experience all the disadvantages attendant on new settlements. The original settlers came over at different times, and for different purposes ; belonged to dif- ferent nations, and spoke many different languages. They were not generally enlightened ; had no oneness of interests or views ; pursued no system of institutions ; and formed no settled habits. The English, Germans, Dutch, French and Irish, still retain, in a degree, their national languages, prejudices, virtues and vices. They have settled generally by themselves, have little intercourse with each other, and little inclination or opportunity to form a common character. There are two large cities in -these states, and the smaller towns are too prone to ape city manners and city life. The slaves are not sufficiently numerous to have any material influence on the character of the people. The body ofthe inhabitants live on scattered farms, and culti- vate their own lands. The elections are very corrupt; indi- viduals acquire undue influence. Individuals and families are found-, however, scattered in great numbers, over all this divis- ion, distinguished for their intelligence, their piety, their re- finement, and their worth \u2014 men who would be among the best citizens of any country. The state of New York, in consequence ofthe numerous emigrations from the Eastern States, is be- coming more and more assimilated to them in her institutions and manners. In the Southern States, also, religion is not supported by law, and large portions of the inhabitants enjoy no regular stated preaching. They live chiefly on plantations, and have generally been provided with schools. Considerable numbers of the white inhabitants cannot read. Labour is generally done, on th\u00bb coast, by slaves and by the poor. The division of the inhab itants into rich and poor is as in many countries of Europe. Slavery has tended to corrupt the public morals, and has pro duced other bari effects. The slaves, with few exceptions, are treated with humanity and kindness. Duelling is here common. Horse-racing and cock-fighting, particularly the former, are favourite amusements. Many of the inhabitants, however, far from possessing this character, or practising these vices, hold them in abhorrence. The ladies, also, almost universally de serve the esteem of all those who know how to value delicacy and amiable manners. ARTS. The state of the arts corresponds to that of the literature of the United States. In the mechanic arts, and in painting, en graving, and architecture, among the fine arts, there is as much native genius in the United States as in any part of the world ; and this genius, for the last few years, has been cultivated to a very considerable extent, and in some instances has rivalled the OPSt splendid exhibition of it in the old world."], [22, "16 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW ARMY. A standing army is necessarily an object of jealousy in a re publican state ; and as the United States have no formidable enemy in their vicinity, and are at the same time extremely studious of economy in all branches of their government, their military force has always been kept on a very low scale. By an act of congress of 3d March, 1815, the strength of the regular army was fixed at 9980 men, viz. eight battalions of artillery, 3200 men ; one regiment light artillery, 660 ; eight regiments of infantry, 5440 ; and one regiment of riflemen, 680. In 1821 it was reduced to 6442 men, whose pay, clothing, &c. cost the states 1,927,179 dollars, or 299 dollars for each individual, offi cers and privates. And in March, 1822, its strength, as reported to congress, was as follows : Engineers 23 Four regiments of artillery 1977 Seven do. infantry 3367 Ordnance men 53 5420 The militia, which constitutes the principal military force of the United States, consists of all the males between the age of eighteen and forty-five. According to a return made in the end of 1823, it amounted to 993,281 men. The American militia, as we have already stated, elect their own officers. When called into the field of actual service, they have the same pay and allowance as the regular army, but are only bound to serve for six months. \"\u25a0\u25a0 NAVY. The navy of the United States is small in point of numerical strength, but is perhaps the best organized and most efficient in the world. The unexpected and astonishing success of their frigates in combat with British vessels of the same class during the last war, established at once the reputation of the American navy for skill and prowess, in the eyes of Europe ; and the United States, with a very few ships, already rank high as a naval power. .From 1816 to 1821 one million of dollars was expended annually in building ships of war. Since 1821 the sum thus appropriated has been reduced one half. A few ships are always kept in commission, and stationed partly in the West Indies, partly in the Mediterranean, \u2014 to keep in check the Bar bary powers,--and partly in the Pacific. In November, 1823, the strength of the American navy was as follows : In commission. In ordinary.

REVENUE, (1824.) Customs $16,500,000 Public lands 1,600,000 Bank dividends 350,000 Arrears and repayments 100,000 $18,550,000 EXPENDITURE.

The bank dividends consist of the interest of 7,000,000 dollars capital, vested by the govern ment in the national bank. The post office yields about a mil lion of dollars a year, which is wholly consumed in supporting the establishment. The entire revenue of the United States may be estimated, on an average, at four millions, or four millions and a quarter sterling, or eighteen millions to eighteen and a half millions dollars ; and the annual expense ofthe government, under the three heads of civil, military and naval, at ten millions dollars. This is at the rate of one dollar per annum for each inhabitant. If we add one dollar more for the sums levied by the state governments, the whole expense of the Americ j.n gov ernment will be at the rase bf two dollars for each inhabitant. PUBLIC DEBT. The debt ofthe United States consists of sums borrowed dur ing the revolutionary war, and at various subsequent periods. The debt due by the federal government, at the close of the war in 1783, was 42,000,375 dollars. No provision being made for the payment of the interest, and the public revenue often failing short ofthe expenditure, the debt continued to increase, and in 1790 it amounted to 79,124,464 dollars. Various measures were taken for its liquidation, but with little effect, till about the middle of Mr. Jefferson's administration, in 1805. From that period a gradual reduction took place, till it was stopped by the war with England in 1812. 2*"], [24, "18 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW In 1812 the amount of public debt was . . $45,035,123 In consequence of the loans made during the war, it amounted, in 1816, to .... . 123,016,375 Considerable progress has since been made in payino- off the debt, and on the 1st January, 1824, it was reduced to 90,177,962 And, by the operation of a balance accumula- ting in the treasury, on the 1st Jan. 1825, it amounted to about 80,000,000 The duties of the customs are levied on foreign articles im ported, and are partly ad valorem, and partly according to fixed rates. The duties on manufactured goods, of iron, cotton, and woollen, were from 20 to 30 per cent, but have been increased from a fifth to a fourth by a new tariff established in 1824. NATIONAL FUNDS. These consist of stock, custom-house bonds, lots in the city of Washington, and public lands. In 1810 the custom-house bonds amounted to $9,600,000. The total valuation of the whole United States in that year, by Blodget, was $2,519,009,090. Tlie circulating medium was calculated at from $15,000,000 to $20,000,000 in specie. In 1813 the commissioners of the iand office estimated the lands then belonging to the United States, east of the Mississippi, at 400,000,000 acres ; to 56,225,000 acres of which the Indian title had been extinguished. The quantity west of the Mississippi cannot be determined till our northern and western boundaries are settled. The total sales of lands north-west of Ohio, from the opening ofthe land offices, to September 30, 1818, were 10,175,637 61} acres, for $21,545,797:45. The total sales in Mississippi and Alabama during tbe same period were 2,514,111 04 acres, for $7,950,660:31. The amount of the valuation of houses, lands and slaves, hi all the states, in 1814-15, was $1,902,296,961:34, of which $270,639,737:17 Was the estimated value of slaves \u2014 so much property in human flesh is held in the United States. The increase of property in the United States, in fifteen years, from 1799 to 1814, was $950,293,808. In the state of New- York, the increase in this period was 175,000,000, and in Penn sylvania, upwards of 240,000,000. The average value of land in the United States is about $10 per acre. MINT. The mint was established in 1791. The purity of the silver coin is the same with that of Spain, and that of the gold coin with that ofthe strictest European nations. The amount of gold, silver and copper, coined in the year 1804, was, gold, $258,642 ; silver, $100,340 ; copper, $12,884:94 ; total, $371,826:94 ;\u2014 in 1810, gold, $476,555; silver, $638,773:50; copper, $16,140; total, $1,131,468:50. The gold coins are eagles, half eagles, quarter eagles and dollars ; the silver are dollars, half dollars,"], [25, "19 OF THE UNITED STATES. I \u25a0quarter dollars, dimes and half dimes ; the copper are cents and half cents. The denominations increase and decrease in a tenfold proportion. In ordinary computation, the only denomi nations used are dollars, cents and mills. These last are merely nominal. POST OFFICE. The amount of postage, from January 1, 1790, to Oct. 1, 1809, was $5,305,093 ; and the expenses of the establishment were $4,549,601:55 ; net proceeds, $755,492, in 19 years. For the succeeding seven years, to 1816, the income amounted to $729,826:19. The number of post offices in 1791 was 89 ; in 1800\u2014903 ; in 1810\u20142,300 ; in 1816\u20143,260 ; and in 1823\u2014 5,242. The mail is transported, in stages, each day in the year, 10,121 miles ; and in sulkies and on horseback, each day in the year, 10,616 miles ; making 20,737 per day. If the post roads ofthe United States be divided into two distinct post routes, the mail will travel, each week, in stages, nearly equal to three times round the globe ; and divide all the post roads in the United States into four equal or distinct post routes, on which the mail is carried in stages, sulkies and on horseback, it will be equal to a\" travel of six times, each week, round the globe, averaging one post office for every fifteen miles of post road. The mail is transported, by a direct or corresponding line of stages, from Anson, in the state of Maine, through Washing ton city, to Nashville, Tennessee, a distance of one thousand four hundred and forty-eight miles, in a south-eastern direction. The mail is transported, by a direct line of stages, from St. Ma ry's, Georgia, to Highgate, in Vermont, through Washington city, a distance of one thousand three hundred and sixty-nine miles. The amount of postage in 1808 did not equal the ex pense of the establishment. In 1815, the revenue of the post office was $294,944. BANKS. Banks are extremely numerous in the United States ; but the system of banking is bad. Of 400 of these establishments, which existed in 1818, a great proportion had little or no real capital, and were merely a sort of gambling speculations, got up by knots of adventurers, and supported for a time by local influence or artifice, but ultimately falling down, and spreading distress and ruin among the industrious classes. Two thirds or more of these banks stopped payment in the four years ending 1820, and the circulating medium, which, in 1815, was estimated at 110,000,000 of dollars, was reduced by these failures to forty five millions in 1819. The American banks generally issue notes for so small a sum as one dollar, and some of them have been accustomed to issue bills for fractional parts of that coin. To remedy the disorders arising from the unsound state of the currency, the national bank, was instituted in 1816, with a capi tal of 35,000,000 of dollars, divided into shares of 100 dollars"], [26, "20 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW ' each. Some peculiar privileges were bestowed on this bank, which has branches established in the principal cities of the Union ; but the value of its stock has fluctuated much ; and it has neither proffered nor supplied an efficient correction to the evils of the currency. A bank ofthe United States, which was incorporated in Feb ruary, 1791, expired in March of 1811, congress refusing to re new\" the charter. The capital was ten millions of dollars. Be fore this event, the whole number of banks was ninety -five, and the amount of banking capital was estimated at fifty-five millions of dollars. 1 CITIES. The principal cities in the United States, placed according to the population in 1820, are, Boston, 42,298 ; New York, 123,706 ; Philadelphia, 108,802; Baltimore, 62,738; Charleston, 24,780; New Orleans, 27,176 ; Washington, 13,200. INLAND NAVIGATION. North America is penetrated by two great rivers, the Missis sippi and the St. Lawrence, by which navigation is extended to a great distance into the interior. The St. Lawrence, how-ever, is not claimed by the United States. The Mississippi and its branches drain the great central ba sin, which lies between the Alleghany and Rocky Mountains. On this river the navigation, for boats of considerable burthen, extends to the Falls of St. Anthony. On the Missouri, which is the largest, and in fact the principal stream, it extends to the Gates ofthe Rocky Mountains. From the character ofthe country, the numerous branches of these great rivers are generally navigable, and afford a passage from almost every part of the Western States, and the vast re gions at the base of the Rocky Mountains, to the Gulf of Mexi co and the ocean, at least, during the season of high water, from the spring to the middle of summer. The current of the principal streams is so rapid, that, although their depth would admit vessels of considerable size, the navi gation is chiefly by means of steamboats. Even the ascent from the mouth of the Mississippi to New Orleans is so difficult, that vessels are sometimes delayed 30 days. The navigation ofthe Mississippi is attended with some dan ger, from the numerous trees, fixed in its bed, which are called by the boatmen planters or sawyers, and are as fatal to the boats as reefs of rocks. Below Natchez, these dangers are ob viated by the depth of water. Above this, they become more and more numerous, and difficult to pass ; but the main channel, though intricate, affords depth of water, in all stages, sufficient for boats of five or six feet draught, to the mouth of the Ohio. From this point to the mouth of the Missouri, 220 miles, the navigation is obstructed by shoals at low water, which will not admit boats drawing more than three feet."], [27, "21 OF THE UNITED STATES. The obstructions to the navigation of the Missouri resemble those in the Mississippi, but are much greater. This stream is rapid and turbulent. No part of it is exempt from rafts, bars, snags, and other obstructions, and the channel is very intricate. The Ohio is navigable, for boats of considerable burthen, from the middle of February to the latter part of June, and again, for a few weeks, during the freshet in the autumn. The falls at Louisville can be passed by large boats only at the highest water. During low water, boats cannot pass some other rapids and shoals. The Arkansas is the next branch to the Missouri in size. It has only short periods of flood, and will not admit boats of considerable burthen. The branches ofthe Missouri are usually blocked up at their mouths after the freshet in July, until the next spring, by mud brought down by the Missouri, and of course they are navigable only during the freshets. Lake Champlain is a branch of the St. Lawrence, emptying into it by the River Sorelle, or Richelieu. Vessels of 150 tons may ascend 12 or 14 miles ; and boats tc Chambly or St. John's. From this place there is a ship navigation of 160 miles on the lake, to the shores of Vermont and New York. The numerous rivers on the eastern declivity of the Apalachi an chair., afford the advantages of a good inland navigation to most parts of the Atlantic States. 5n all those streams which flow through the alluvial region, from the Mississippi to the Roanoke, the tide waters of the ocean terminate at some dis tance from the sect of the .mountains, varying frc~; -o*0 to 120 miles. From the Roanoke to the Delaware', they extend through the alluvial region, to the base of the primitive hills ; but in no river, south-west of the Hudson, do they pass beyond the alluvial region. As far as the, tides flow, the streams are generally navigable for sloops. In passing from the hilly to the flat and alluvial region, the streams are almost uniformly precipitated over ledges of rocks, by which their navigation is obstructed. Indeed the line of the alluvion marks the line of navigation from the sea, which passes through Milledgeville on the Altamaha, Augusta on the Savannah, Columbia and Camden on*he Santee, Richmond on the James, Fredericksburg on the Rappahannock, Georgetown on the Potomac, and Trenton on the Delaware. Above the rapids, navigation is pursued entirely in boats propelled by oars or poles, or drawn up by ropes, or by means of the bushes growing on the banks. The coast of North Carolina is lined with a range of low, sandy islands, enclosing a chain of sounds. Their entrances are generally obstructed by bars, and no vessels of considerable size can enter. But the streams are navigable for sloops, some distance into the interior. The Chesapeake Bay is of itself an inland sea of considerable size, and, with the numerous streams and inlets on its borders,"], [28, "22 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW i forms an important channel to the ocean, for a largo extent of country, covering most of Maryland and the eastern declivity of Virginia ; and extending through the middle section of Pennsylvania, nearly to the small lakes of New York. The largest ships have access to its shores, and proceed to some distance in several of its streams. Not far from the entrance of the bay, are Hampton Roads, which is the first anchoring ground for vessels from the ocean. The Potomac is navigable, for ships of any burthen, to the navy yard at Washington ; and this is the most inland point, in the United States, to which the largest vessels have access. Above Washington, there are five falls on this stream, which are ren dered passable by canals. Thus a boat navigation is opened to its sources, which are connected with the waters ofthe Missis sippi by the great Cumberland Road. The Hudson is the only river in the United States, where the tide passes through the alluvial, hilly, or primitive and transition formations. It is navigable for ships to the city of Hudson ; and sloops of considerable burthen pass through all the formations to the falls above Troy, which is 165 miles from the ocean. This is the most distant point to which the tides flow, and to which sea vessels can approach, in a direct line, in the United States. At its mouth this river forms the harbour of New York, which is considered one ofthe first in the world. In the rivers of the states east of the Hudson, the tide ex tends only a small distance, and the navigation is obstructed by the falls and rapids which are common in the hilly or primitive countries. \u2014 - The Connecticut is navigable, for vessels of considerable size, 50 miles, to Hartford. Several canals and locks have been con structed on this river at South Hadley, Hanover, and some in termediate rapids, which extend the boat navigation to Haver hill in New Hampshire. Narragansett Bay, and the streams which empty into it, afford easy access from the ocean to every part of Rhode Island. The rivers of Maine are generally obstructed. The Penob scot, the St. John's, and the western branch of the Kennebec. afford a boat navigation nearly to their sources. The heads of these rivers approach w7ithin no great distance of the waters of -the St. Lawrence ; and the portage from the head of the Ken nebec to that ofthe Chaudiere River is about five miles. INVENTIONS. Of all the discoveries and inventions yet accomplished, the machinery that saves labour, incidental to manufactures, in the greatest degree, is that of Mr. Eli Whitney, for ginning cotton wool. This patent machine was invented about the year 1793. Before its invention, very little upland cotton was cultivated, and scarcely a single pound was exported from the United States ; afterwards, the culture of this species of cotton became the principal object of the planter in South Carolina and Geoi->"], [29, "23 OF THE UNITED STATES. gia ; and in the year 1807, more than fifty-five millions of pounds of upland cotton were exported, and which were valued at more than eleven and a half millions of dollars. It has rarely occur red that the invention of a single machine has, at once, changed tlie employment of so many thousand people, and has added so much to the wealth and resources of a people. So numerous are the various other labour-saving machines, introduced and invented in this country, that it would be in vain to attempt even to name them all. They have been applied to breweries, distilleries and tanneries; to the manufacture of cards; of carded and combed wool, flax and hemp; of nails, screws and buttons ; \u2014 have been used for splitting leather, which formerly was half wasted in parings ; for making dip tallow candles, and lint for medical purposes ; for moulding paper in the paper manufactories ; for facilitating printing ; and even for teaching the gramnlar of our language. The Americans were the first to bring steamboats and their substitutes, teamboats, into effective practical use, in 1807. They were first proved in America to be practicable, in 1786 to 1798, by Ramsay and Fitch. These steamboats are now used in great and increasing num bers on the Atlantic coast, and western rivers and lakes. To these have been added the tremendous vessels of war, called the steam frigates. These wonderful machines, working as if they were animated beings, endowed with all the talents of their inventors, labouring with organs that never tire, and subject to no expense of food, bed, clothing or dwelling, may justly be considered as equivalent to an immense body of manufacturing recruits, suddenly enlisted in the service of the country. MANUFACTURES. The cheapness of land, and the great profits which farming affords, check tbe growth of manufactures in tbe United States. Linen, woollen and cotton articles for domestic use, however, are made very generally in the farmers' houses ; and fabrics of a finer kind, including fancy and ornamental articles, are now manufactured in extensive works in Pennsylvania, New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Cabinet ware, and the coarser species of iron work, are made in high perfec tion ; and in ship building, the construction of w7ooden bridges, and mill machinery, the Americans are probably superior to any nation in Europe. According to the official returns in 1810, the whole value of the manufactures that year was 127,694,602 dollars ; but, allowing for articles omitted or under-estimated, the true amount was computed to be 172,700,000 dollars. Sup posing the growth ofthe manufactures to have kept pace with that of the population, the amount, in 1823, would be about 240,000,000 dollars. COMMERCE. The commerce of the United States is second in extent only to that of Britain, and much greater than that of any state with"], [30, "24 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW an equal population. The principal articles of domestic growth or manufacture exported, are cotton, tobacco, wheat and flour, lumber and naval stores, ashes, fish, beef, rice, and flax seed. The imports consist chiefly of woollens, cottons, linens, silks, iron ware, coffee, sugar, spirits, wines. , The states that have the greatest quantity of shipping are New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. A considerable proportion of the tonnage belonging to the Northern States is employed in carrying away the produce of the Southern, which have comparatively a small number of ships and mariners, though the cotton and tobacco, raised in these states, furnish fully one half of the exports of -the Union. The vast number of navigable rivers in the United States afford ex traordinary facilities for communications by water ; and hence their internal commerce, compared with that of other nations, is still greater than their foreign trade. The admirable inven tion of steamboats has had a most beneficial effect, in North America, in quickening and improving river navigation. The trade with the Indians of the United States was carried on by licenses, given to persons of good character, from 1775 to 1802, when a new law was passed, substituting fine, 'imprison ment, forfeiture and bonds, without making a good character or citizenship requisite. Without superseding the plan of licenses, a system of trade tyy public factors commenced in 1796. The president was authorized to establish trading houses, and to appoint an agent to each house, to carry on, as the act states, \"a liberal trade with the Indians.\" Tbe act appropriated 150,000 dollars as the capital of this hrade, and the additional sum of 8,000 dollars annually for the payment of agents and clerks ; and directed the trade to be carried on so as not to di minish the capital. It was limited to two years ; but was by a subsequent act continued in force till 1806. A-superintendent of Indians was then appointed, and the capital increased to 260,000 dollars, and 13,000 dollars were appropriated for the payment of superintendent, agents and clerks. This act was limited to three years, but afterwards was continued in force till 1811. The capital was then increased to 300,000 dollars, with an annual appropriation of 19,250 dollars for the payment of superintendent, agents and clerks. It appears to have been the aim of tne government to conduct Indian trade with pru dence and humanity. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Face of the Country. \u2014 The United States, considered as a country, may with more propriety be characterized as uneven, than as level or hilly. In so extensive a tract, however, no general language can adequately describe the real state of facts. This can only be learned from a more minute description. New England is generally hilly; Vermont is mountainous; Maine and the eastern coast of New Hampshire and Massachusetts are only uneven. The Middle States are principally uneven, except"], [31, "OF THE UNITED STATES. 25 a. broad tract, running from north-west to south-east through the centre of this division, which is mountainous. In the Southern States, a broad belt of land, of 100 to 250 miles wide, extending the whole length ofthe coast, is a uniform dead level. Back of this the land becomes uneven and hilly, and finally rises into the Alleghany Mountains, which separate the wateis ofthe At lantic fromlhose ofthe Ohio and Mississippi. Part of Kentucky and Tennessee is mountainous ; while Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi are level. The territory west of tbe Mississippi, in cluded in the boundaries of the United States, corresponds in its prominent features to that on the east. It is divided from south to north by the chain of the Rocky Mountains, which divide the waters that fall east, into the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi, from those that flow west, into the Pacific Ocean. SOIL AND AGRICULTURE. It has been estimated, that thirteen-sixteenths of the country east of the Mississippi (excluding Florida) are covered with a strong, fertile soil, fitted, with a moderate degree of cultivation, abundantly to repay the labour of the husbandman. Of the re maining three sixteenths, about 57,000,000 acres are covered with water ; about 40,000,000 acres consist of a mountainous country, almost universally forested, and which, from the nature of its surface, rather than its soil, is unfit for cultivation; and about 29,000,000 acres are either sandy, or covered with so poor a soil as to offer slight encouragement, except to the most elaborate agriculture, when the general value of land shall be greatly advanced. Of 520,000,000 acres, capable of advanta geous cultivation, only 40,950,000 were estimated to be under actual improvement in 1811. This is about 5| acres for e^ch individual of the contemporaneous population. Taking the present population at cen millions, and allowing the same quan tity for each person, the land under actual improvement must now be nearly 60,000,000 of acres, which is about one-twelfth part of the whole surface east of the Mississippi, including Florida. According to returns made in 1798, the lands valued, and upon which tax was paid, in sixteen states, was 163,000,000 out 0^308,000,000 acres, or little more than one half, and the es timated value was 479,000,000 dollars. The population then be ing about five millions, the appropriated land amounted to about thirty acres for each individual inhabitant. The average value was about three dollars per acre, but, in some of the old and thickly-settled states, it was as high as fifteen dollars per acre. The value of the houses was about 140,000,000 of dollars, or two-sevenths of that of the lands. When returns were made a second time, in 1814, the value of houses and lands jointly was found to be 1,630,000,000 of dollars. If, therefore, the value of every species of property grew as rapidly as that of houses and lands, each 100 dollars must have increased to 253, in an inter val of fifteen years. This implies an annual augmentation of six and one fourth per -cent., at which rate the capital of the 3"], [32, "26 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW Country must double in eleven or twelve years ; in other words, the capital is increasing with twice the velocity ofthe population. In a country having so many varieties of soil and climate as the United States, there is necessarily a considerable diversity in the agricultural productions. Maize, or Indian corn, is cul tivated in all parts of the country, but succeeds best in the Middle States. It is a most useful vegetable, fitted to a greater variety of situations than wheat, and yielding generally double the produce. Wheat is also raised in all parts of the country, but thrives best in the Middle and Western States. The culti- vation of tobacco begins in Maryland, about the thirty-ninth or fortieth parallel, and continues through all the Southern, and partially through the Wesern States. It forms the staple of Maryland and Virginia. Cotton grows as far north as 39\u00b0, but its cultivation is not profitable beyond 37\u00b0. This useful plant was first raised for exportation only in 1791. It is now produced in immense quantities from the Riverr, Roanoke to the Missis- sippi, and forms the leading article of export from the United States. The best grows in dry situations in Carolina and Geor- gia, upon the sea coast. The rice crops, which require great heat, and a soil susceptible of irrigation, commence about the name parallel, and have nearly the same geographical range. The sugar cane grows in low and warm situations, as high as the latitude of 33\u00b0, but the climate favourable for its cultivation does no extend beyond 31 i\u00b0. It is now cultivated to a great extent in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. It is stated, that, in Louisiana alone, 20,000,000 of pounds of sugar were raised in 1817, when the whole quantity consumed in the republic was estimated at 70,000,000 of pounds. Oats, rye and batiey are raised in all the Northern and Middle States. Hemp and flax are raised in the Western States. The vine thrives as far north as Pennsylvania, but home wines are only made yet to a very limited extent. Natural meadows are more numerous in New England and in New York than in parts farther south. BAYS. The Chesapeake is a very spacious bay, 200 miles in length, from Havre de Grace to the southern extremity, and from 7 to 18 miles in breadth ; and covering 2660 square miles, or 1,700,000 acres. It is generally as much as nine fathoms deep, and affords many commqdious harbours, and a safe and easy navigation. The mouths ofthe James, York and Potomac Rivers are merely arms ofthe Chesapeake. This is true of the latter river, for at least fifty miles from its mouth. This bay receives the waters of the Susquehannah, Potomac, Rappahannock, York and James Rivers, besides numberless small streams, both from the eastern and western shores. It opens from the west into the Atlantic by a mouth twelve miles wide, between Cape Charles and Cape Henry. ' Delaware Bay separates New Jersey from Delaware. It is sixty-five miles long, from Fisher's Point to Cape Henlopen ; and,"], [33, "OF THE UNITED STATES. 27 in the broadest part, thirty miles wide ; containing about 985 square miles, or 630,000 acres. It receives the waters of no large rivers except the Delaware. It opens from the north-west into the Atlantic, between Cape May and Cape Henlopen. Massachusetts Bay is a part of the ocean putting up between Cape Ann and Cape Cod. Its length is about sixty miles, and the distance between the two capes is forty-five. Narragansett Bay, in Rhode Island, is thirty-five miles long. The first twenty of it is a regular parallelogram, thirteen miles wide. It covers an area of about 290 square miles, or 185,000 acres. It communicates with the ocean between Point Judith on the west and Point Seaconet on the east. SOUNDS. Long Island Sound, between Connecticut and New York on the north, and Long Island on the south, is 140 miles long, and from 3 to 25 broad. It has two communications with the ocean. The eastern is broad and unobstructed. At the west, and by a narrow strait one mile wide, opposite to New York, it communi cates with York Bay, and through that with the ocean at Sandy Hook. The celebrated strait called Hell Gate is near the west end of the sound, about 8 miles east of New York, and is re markable for its whirlpools, which make a tremendous roaring at certain times of the tide. These whirlpools are occasioned by the narrowness and crookedness of the pass, and by a bed of rocks which extend across it. A skilful pilot may, with perfect safety, conduct a ship of any burthen through this strait with the tide, or at still water with a fair wind. The sound affords a very safe and convenient inland navigation. Pamlico Sound lies between the eastern shore of North Caro lina and a chain of sand islands, which stretch along the shore of that state, through half its extent. The southern part of this body of water is commonly designated by this name ; but.there is evidently nothing which intervenes to separate it from the northern part. Taken in its whole extent, from the northern extremity, in Princess Ann county in Virginia, to Cape Look out, it is not less than 200 miles long. Its breadth varies from 3 to 20 miles. The chain of islands, which separate it from the main ocean, is scarcely a mile wide, and is generally covered with small trees and bushes. There are five of these islands and a peninsula, separated from each other by five inlets, Cur rituc, Roanoke, Gant, Ocrecoc and Cedar ; but Ocrecoc is the only one that will admit vessels of burthen. There is here four teen feet water at low tide. Six miles within this inlet there is a hard sand shoal, called the Swash, lying across the channel, on which there is only nine feet water at low tide. Ships draw ing ten feet water find between the inlet and sound, good an chorage. Pamlico Sound receives the waters of Chowan, Ro anoke, Pamlico, and Neus Rivers. Albemarle Sound puts up from Pamlico into North Carolina ft distance of sixty miles. It is from eight to twelve miles broad,"], [34, "28 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW and is really a bay, having but one communication with the ocean. It is the estuary of the Roanoke and Chowan. CAPES. The most noted capes in the United States are Cape Ann, Cape Cod, Cape Malabar, Montauk Point, Sandy Hook, Cape May, Cape Henlopen, Cape Charles, Cape Henry, Cape Hatte ras, Cape Lookout and Cape Fear. RIVERS. The Mississippi is the most celebrated river of the United States ; but it is now found that the Missouri is the principal branch, and has the best claim to the magnificent title of \" Father of waters,\" conferred on the smaller branch by the Indians. Mississippi proper has its source in Turtle Lake, near the 48th degree of north latitude. At the picturesque Falls of St. An thony, it descends from the plateau, where it has its origin, to a vast plain, which accompanies it to the sea. After a course of 280 leagues, its limpid waters mingle themselves with the turbid stream ofthe Missouri. At the point of confluence, each of these rivers is about half a mile broad. At the distance of about ltIO miles below the mouth of the Missouri, it is joined by the Ohio, aster the latter has received the tributary waters of the Wabash, the Cumberland and the Tennessee Rivers. Lower down, the Mississippi has its volume considerably increased by the Arkan sas and Red River, and falls into the Gulf of Mexico, after a course of 2500 miles. The river, in the last half of its course, presents some peculiar phenomena. Besides its principal and permanent mouth, it has several lateral outlets, called bayous, which carry off part of its waters. In Louisiana the surface of the stream is more elevated than the adjoining lands- Its im mense volume of waters is confined and supported by dikes and levees, composed of soft earth, and rising a few feet above the usual height of the inundations. These banks of the river, which decline gradually into the swampy plains behind, are from a quarter to a half a mile in breadth, and form the richest and best soil in the country. The three principal outlets, or bayous, call ed the Atchafalaya, the La Fourche, and the Iberville, embrace an extensive delta, composed of soft, swampy earth, rising very little above tide water. The actual embouchure of the river parts into three branches, each of which has a bar at its entrance, the deepest affording only seventeen feet water. Within the bar, the depth of the water, for two or three hundred miles, is from 50 to 150 feet. The average breadth of the Mississippi, below the junction with the Missouri, is about 1000 yards, or two thirds of a mile. The Mississippi and its branches traverse countries thickly wooded, and hence vast numbers of trees, either uprooted by the winds, or falling from the effects of age, are borne down by its waters, united by lianas, and cemented by soft, adhesive mud. These spoils of the forest become floating islands, upon which."], [35, "OF THE UNITED STATES. 29 young trees take root. There the pistia and the munphar display their yellow flowers, and the serpents, the birds, and the cayman alligator, come and repose on those flowery rafts, which are sometimes carried to the sea, and engulfed in its waters. Sometimes a large tree attaches itself to a sand bank firmly, and, stretching out its branches like so many hooks, entangles all the floating objects that approach it. A single tree is often sufficient to arrest thousands in their course : the mass accumulates from year to year ; and thus are gradually created new isles, new capes and peninsulas, which change the course of the stream, and force it to seek out new channels. The tides are not felt in the Mississippi, in consequence of the numerous sinuosities. The winds are variable ; and though the prevailing wind is from the south, and favours vessels sail ing against the stream, still the navigation upwards is slow and difficult, especially during the floods, when the current has ,a. velocity of three or four miles an hour. These floods occur in May, June, and July. The additional waters form an inclined plane, the rising being fifty feet in Tennessee, twenty-five feet near the mouth of Red River, and twelve feet at New Orleans. The invention of steamboats has perhaps nowhere been so beneficial as in the navigation of this river. The voyage up wards from New Orleans to the Falls of Ohio, which often oc cupied sailing vessels three months, may now be accomplished in fifteen or eighteen days. We shall mention very briefly the other considerable rivers of the United States. The Bay of Mobile receives the waters of the Alabama, which has two large branches, the Alabama and the Tombigbee. Farther east is the Apalachicola. The only large river in Florida is the St. John, which rises in a marsh, and, flowing northward, parallel to the coast, falls into the At lantic. The Alatamaha, Savannah, Santee, and Pedee are the most considerable rivers in Georgia and South Carolina. They are all navigable to a considerable distance, but have their mouths, less or more obstructed by sand bars. The entrance into Cape Fear River, the Neuse aud Roanoke, is still more dif ficult, in consequence ofthe line of sand banks which cover the whole coast of North Carolina. To the north of Cape Henry, extends the magnificent Bay of Chesapeake, which receives, as has been mentioned, James River, the Potomac and the Susque hannah. The Delaware falls into a bay of the same name. The Bay of New York receives the Hudson, a large river, in which the tide ascends 160 miles, and which is the scene of a most ex tensive and active inland commerce. The most considerable rivers east of the Hudson are the Connecticut, the Merrimac, the Kennebec, and the Penobscot. The small River St. Croix sepa rates the territories ofthe United States from New Brunswick. LAKES. To the largest of the chain of lakes between Canada and the United States, the earliest travellers have given the name of 3*"], [36, "30 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW Lake Superior. It is more than five hundred leagues in cu** cumference ; its clear waters, fed by forty rivers, are contained within immense strata of rocks, and the surges nearly equal those of the Atlantic. Lake Huron, which is connected with the other by the Straits of St. Mary, has a periphery of 300 leagues, and receives the waters of Lake Superior through a series of rapid descents. The outline of Lake Michigan is sup posed to be about 200 leagues : it communicates with the former by a long strait, which serves for an outlet for its waters ; and the country around its banks belongs exclusively to the United States. Lake Huron discharges itself into the rapid River of St. Clair, which, by the accession of other streams, is changed into a small lake of the same name. A less violent channel, properly called the Detroit, unites this basin with Lake Erie, which is more than ninety leagues in length, and about twenty, or thirty broad. On account, however, of its shallow waters, and the un equal elevation of its banks, it is subject to storms, which render navigation dangerous. This lake communicates with the River Niagara, and with those celebrated cataracts, of which so much has been written, although no description can' convey an ade quate idea of their awful sublimity. The River Niagara de scends by this splendid porch into Lake Ontario, which is ap parently calm, although its waters are subject to phenomena re sembling those of the tides. This lake is nearly one hundred and seventy miles long, and sixty broad at the widest part. It empties itself, through the romantic Lake of a Thousand Isles, into the St. Lawrence. MOUNTAINS. Two great chains of mountains traverse the territory of the United States, in a direction approaching to south and north ; the Alleghany Mountains on the east side, and the Rocky Moun tains on the west. They divide the country into an \"eastern, western and middle region, the latter comprising the great basin or valley of the Mississippi. The Alleghanies are less a chain of mountains than a long plateau, crested with several low chains of hills, separated from each other by wide and elevated valleys. East of the Hudson, the Alleghanies consist chiefly of granitic hills, with rounded summits, often covered to a great height with bogs and turf, and distributed in irregular groups, without any marked direction. Some peaks of the Green Mountains in Vermont, and the White Mountains in New Hampshire, rise to the height of 5000 or 6000 feet above the level of the sea. After we pass the Hudson, the structure of the Alleghanies appears to change. In Pennsyl vania and Virginia, they assume the form of long parallel ridges, varying in height from 2500 to 4000 feet, and occupying a breadth of a hundred miles. In Tennessee, where they ter minate, they again lose the form of continuous chains, and break into groups of isolated mountains, touching at their base, some of which attain an elevation of 5000 or 6000 feet."], [37, "31 OF THE UNITED STATES. The Rocky Mountains are upon a much grander scale than the Alleghanies. Their base is three hundred miles in breadth ; and their loftiest summits, which are covered with eternal snow, rise to the height of 12,000 feet. They are placed at the dis tance of 500 or 600 miles from the Pacific Ocean ; but between them and the coast there is another range of mountains, called the Ozarks, six or seven hundred miles in length, about one hundred broad, and having an elevation varying from 1000 to 2000 feet above the sea. This range of low mountains, which is penetrated by two branches of the Mississippi, the Arkansas and the Red River, was nearly altogether unknown till within these few years, and has not been delineated, so far as we know, in any maps hitherto published in this country. FORESTS. Hardly a spot could have been found in the United States, which was not covered with forest trees, when they were first settled. And those parts of the country, which are not yet cleared and cultivated, which are probably three fourths of the whole, still retain their natural covering. Forests far more extensive than any ofthe celebrated forests of Europe are found in every part of the country. None of them, however, have re ceived a name. BOTANY. Much less is known of the natural history ofthe United States, than that of most European countries, and that might fairly be demanded of our countrymen. The productions of the Southern States and of Canada have not been well described by any one author, in a work professedly for that purpose ; but are mostly intermixed with the productions of other parts of the world, in the large works of-European botanists. This renders it difficult to select them, and to give an accurate connected account of them. To remedy this inconvenience, and to rescue this coun try from the reproach of not having any authentic and scientific account of its natural history, Dr. Cutter, who has already ex amined nearly all the vegetables of New England, has for some time contemplated the publication of a botanical work of consid erable magnitude, confined principally to the productions ofthe New Engfand States. Dr. Barton, of Philadelphia, has been collecting materials for a work of a similar nature, to compre hend the Middle and Southern States. When finished, both together will form a complete natural history of the American States. ZOOLOGY. America contains at least one half, and the United States about one fourth, of the quadrupeds of the known world. Some of them are common to both continents ; others are peculiar to the western. Comparing individuals of the same species, in the two continents, some are perfectly similar ; between others"], [38, "32 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW there is some difference in size, colour, or other circumstances ; in a few instances, the animals of the eastern continent are larger than the American ; in most, the reverse is the case. The bison, American ox, or buffalo, though it has a promi nence on its back, is a distinct species from the zebu of India and Africa, or the slightly-humped anerochs of northern Eu rope. The American ox has always the neck, the shoulders, and under part of the body covered with long, rough hair ; it has a long beard under the chin ; and the tail does not reach to the houghs. It differs also from the small musk ox of the ex treme northern parts of the American continent, which has a resemblance, in the singular form of its horns, to the buffalo of the Cape. The moose-deer, which is found from the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, is now rare in the inhabited parts of the United States. It is a gigantic animal, sometimes twelve feet long. The elk, the red-deer, and the caribou, which is probably the reindeer, are also found. There are two species of bear; the one short-legged, living chiefly on vegetables; the other, called the ranging bear, w:hich destroys calves, sheep, pigs, and sometimes children. The wolf is also found in most of the states, and is very destructive to cattle. The catamount, of the size of a large dog, and the spotted tiger, five or six feet long, both voracious animals, are rare. The cougar, or American tiger, is more common. There is a very great variety of other animals, that people the vast tracts of wilderness, and inhabit the woods of almost every part of the United States, affording the pleasures of chase to the active and daring hunter, and game to the less hardy sportsman. Very many of the valuable animals that are found afford furs, which are made, on the frontiers, an article of important and lucrative trade. MINERALOGY. No mines of gold or silver, of any importance, have been dis covered in the United States ; but the useful metals are in gen eral abundantly distributed. Some ofthe ores of iron are found in almost every state ; and mines of this metal are worked in New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, New York, Connecti cut,.New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and North Carolina. The number of furnaces, forges, and bloomeries, in 1810, was 530, and the value of the iron manufactured annually was esti mated at twelve or fifteen millions of dollars. The stores of this metal, which nature seems to have provided for this great country, have been explored, and the amount of manufactures has increased in proportion to the increase of the population, and the growing necessities of the nation. The United States are supplied with copper chiefly from Mexico, and other foreign countries, but ores of this metal exist in most of the states, and in the North-west Territory are said to be in great abundance, in situations of easy access. Lead is chiefly procured from Mis souri, where forty-five mines are worked, and yield three millions"], [39, "OF THE UNITED STATES. 33 of pounds annually. Of coal, there is a large field, twenty miles long by ten broad, twelve miles from Richmond, which has been long worked. This useful mineral is also found at various places in New England, New York and Pennsylvania. But the most abundant supply is on the west side of the Alleghanies, where a coal formation, one of the largest in the world, extends, with some interruption, from the western foot of the mountains across the Mississippi. Salt is chiefly obtained from the sea, or imported in the Eastern States ; but brine springs abound over the valley of the Mississippi, from the Alleghanies to the Rocky Mountains, and, in some situations, on .the western side of the valley, plains occur, of many miles in circuit, which are periodi cally covered with a thick crust of salt. In the county of Barn stable, Massachusetts, the vats in which salt is manufactured, are said to cover fifteen millions of square feet, and to be worth $1,300,000. The salt manufactured in them amounts to about 450,000 bushels. That made at Salina, in New York, in 1826, was 816,000 bushels. Gold is widely spread on the surface of the ground in parts of North Carolina and Virginia. Perhaps the largest piece of native gold ever found was picked up in North Carolina. MINERAL WATERS. The most celebrated mineral waters are those of Saratoga and Ballston, New York ; these will be described in their proper places, under the view of the state of New York. The salt springs, which abound in New York and the Western States, have already been alluded to. The economy of nature seems to be happily exhibited in the disposition of these natural sources ofthe conveniences and necessities of life, and it is found, that, as population multiplies in the degree to increase the frequency and malignity of disease, the bosom of nature yields up some restorative of health ; and as men travel back, to occupy the in terior, remote from the common source of conveniences, there are new discoveries of the provisions with which the earth is every where furnished for the sustenance and happiness of ex istence. NATURAL CURIOSITIES. Probably no other country presents so interesting an object to the eye of curiosity, as the Falls of Niagara. The western fall is the greatest, and the river in this place is more than 600 yards wide, and the perpendicular height of the descent is upwards of 142 feet. The eastern or American cataract is 350 yards in breadth, and 163 feet high. It is separated from the western by Goat's Island, which lies about half a mile from the precipice, and has a sand bank, by means of which, in seasons of low water, the island may be approached from the eastern shore. It is now accessible by a bridge thrown over, a little above the American fall. Goat's Island contains about 8 acres of good land. The great cataract is continually obscured by vapour,"], [40, "34 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW which may be distinguished at a very considerable distance; and its foaming billows appear to float in the heavens. As the density of the mist varies, the adjacent forests and rocks are oc casionally perceived, and they add to the splendour of the scene. The effect produced by the cold of winter on these sheets of water, thus rapidly agitated, is at once singular and magnificent. Icicles of great thickness and length are formed along the banks from the springs which flow over them. The source, simpreg nated with sulphur, are congealed into transparent blue columns. Coves are formed by the spray, particularly on the American side, which have large fissures, disclosing the interior composed of clusters of icicles, similar to the pipes of an organ. Some parts of the falls are consolidated into fluted columns, and the streams above are seen partially frozen. The Table Rock is a part of the Canada bank, which is on the margin of the great sheet of falling water. It furnishes al together the most interesting view of the falls. The eye, look ing up the river, beholds it tumbling with strange magnificence, over the ledges of rocks above. The quantity of water contin ually on the top of the rock, and constantly falling over it, is calculated to be 128,563,200 pounds. VERMONT. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent. \u2014 Vermont lies between lat. 42\u00b0 44' and 45\u00b0 N. and between lon. 71\u00b0 33' and 73\u00b0 26', W. The whole north end is on the parallel 45\u00b0. Its mean length is 1574 miles, its average breadth is 65, and it contains 10,200 square miles of surface. Boundaries. \u2014 N. by Lower Canada ; E. by Connecticut River, which divides it from New Hampshire; S. by Massachusetts; W. by New York. Divisions. \u2014 Vermont is divided into 13 counties, \u2014 Addison, Bennington, Caledonia, Chittenden, Essex, Franklin, Grand Isle, Orang*, Orleans, Rutland, Washington, Windham, Wind sor ; and 238 towns. Name. \u2014 Vermont is merely verd mont, the French for Green Mountain. It is said that Ethan Allen conferred the name on the mountains, and it was thence transferred to the territory. Religion. \u2014 In 1818, there were 75 Congregational ministers, and many vacant churches, and about 120 Baptist congrega tions. Of tbe towns in Vermont, 114 were granted by New- Hampshire, in each of which one right of land, containing usu ally 330 acres, was reserved for the first settled minister ; one right as a glebe for the Church of England ; one to the Society for propagating the Gospel ; and one for the support of a school. In the other towns, granted by Vermont, there was one right re served for a university ; one for a town school ; one for a county grammar school ; and one for the support ofthe gospel."], [41, "OF VERMONT. 35 The Congregational ministers meet annually in convention, in September ; and, with such other persons as choose to pay one dollar a year, constitute the Vermont Missionary Society, a useful and active body in propagating the gospel. Government. \u2014 Vermont was attached to New York till 1791, when it was created an independent member of the Federal Union. Its legislature consists of a house of representatives only, which, with the governor, is elected annually, by all resi dent males of full age. There is no senate, but there is a coun cil of censors, elected once in seven years, whose business is to inquire whether the legislature and executive have done their duty, and whether the constitution has remained inviolate. The statutes of Vermont, and the common law of England, (so far as it is applicable,) make up the laws of Vermont. Population. \u2014 The number of inhabitants was, in 1790, 85,539 ; in 1820, 235,800. Militia. \u2014 In 1813, the whole number of militia in this state was 20,273. By the constitution, the governor is captain-gene ral of all the forces of the state, and the lieutenant-governor, lieutenant-general. Subordinate to these, is one major-generai to each division, and one brigadier-general to each brigade, chosen by the legislature. The bravery ofthe Green Mountain Boys is proverbial. Revenue. \u2014 The revenue of this state arises from rates and taxes granted from time to time by the legislature, and assessed in proportion to the polls and rateable estate. The law deter mines what is taxable estate, and fixes the value at which it shall be taxed. Character. \u2014 The inhabitants of this state are assembled from various places, of different sentiments, manners, and habits. Though rigorously opposed in particular religious and political tenets, they are tenacious of their liberties, and united in se curing them. They are an active, hardy, industrious, and fru gal people. Literature. \u2014 Vermont has two colleges. One is at Burling ton, styled the Vermont University, established in 1791, and has been liberally patronised by the state, but as yet has had but few students. The other is at Middlebury, supported chiefly by private bounty, and is a respectable and flourishing institution. There is an academy in each county, and there are common schools in every town in the state. Towns. \u2014 Montpelier is the seat of government. It is situated on the Onion River, within 10 miles of the centre of the state and is a flourishing town. Burlington, on Lake Champlain, 38 miles W. N. W. of Mont pelier, is the most commercial town in the state, and remarka ble for its delightful situation, and magnificent landscapes. Windsor and Brattleborough, on Connecticut River, are very pleasant and flourishing towns, and places of considerable busi ness. The former contains the state prison. Middlebury, on the Otter Creek, 'at the falls, 32 miles south"], [42, "36 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW of Burlington, has extensive manufactories, and considerable trade. Here is a quarry of excellent marble. Bennington, situated in the S. W. corner of Vermont, is a considerable town, and the oldest in the state. It is famous for a battle fought here, in August, 1777, between the British and Americans. Some of the other most important towns are Vergennes, Newbury, Westminster, Royalston, Randolph, Arlington, and Shaftesbury. Manufactures. \u2014 The value of its manufactures, almost exclu sively from its own productions, was estimated, in 1810, at 4,326,000 dollars. This does not include the various home commodities, among which is the article of maple sugar. Most families manufacture, in their own houses, the greater part of their common clothing from flax and wool raised on their farms. Banks. \u2014 There is one bank in this state, called the Vermont State Bank, established in 1806, wholly the property of the state. It consists of four branches, at Burlington, Middlebury, Woodstock, and Westminster. It is under the management of 13 directors, appointed annually by the legislature. Commerce. \u2014 The inhabitants in the south-east part of the state trade with Hartford and Boston ; in the middle, with Bos ton ; in the north-east, with Portland ; in the south-west, with New York ; in the north-west, with New York and Montreal. Burlington, on Lake Champlain, is the only port of entry. The exports, in 1817, amounted to 913,201 dollars. They con sist of lumber, horses, beef, pork, butter, cheese, wheat, flour, pot and pearl ashes. The imports cannot be fairly estimated, as they are principally sent through the other states. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The winter is cold, but (the sky is usually) serene, and the weather uniform. Snow lies commonly about four months, and, on the highlands, falls four feet deep. Vegetation in the spring is generally rapid. The climate is healthy, but some towns west of the mountains are afflicted with the fever and ague. Face of the Country. \u2014 It is a beautiful, picturesque country, entirely inland, abounding in mountains, which are universally covered with wood \u2014 with birch, beech, maple, ash, elm, and butternut, on the east side, and with evergreens on the west. Almost the whole of this country is formed with mountains ranging parallel with the Connecticut River. The west range, which continues unbroken with few exceptions, is in general the highest. The valleys, or glens, which separate the ranges, are generally narrow, and covered with hemlock, fir, and spruce. Mountains. \u2014 The Green Mountains extend through the whole length of the state, in a direction nearly north and south. The highest summits of this range, in Vermont, are Mansfield Moun tain in Mansfield and Sterling, Camel's Rump, near the east part of Huntington, and Killington Peak, about 10 miles east"], [43, "t OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. 37 of Rutland. Ascutney Mountain lies west of Connecticut River, between Windsor and Weathersfield. The tops of the mountains are chiefly rocky, and covered with moss ; the sides are irregular and rough, and often precipitous. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The soil is very fertile, and fitted for all the purposes of agriculture. Winter wheat is extensively cultivated on the west side ofthe mountains, but does not thrive on the east side. Maize, barley, oats, and flax, succeed every where, and the pastures are excellent. Rivers. \u2014 The west bank of Connecticut River forms the east ern boundary of the state. All the rivers have their source in the Green Mountains, about 35 of which run easterly into the Connecticut, and 25 into Lake Champlain. The principal rivers within the state are Lamoille, Onion, Otter Creek, Missisque, Deerfield, Pasumic, White and Black Rivers. Lakes. \u2014 Lake Champlain is 128 miles long, and 12 broad, more than two thirds of which lies in this state. Lake Mem phremagog lies chiefly in Lower Canada. It is 40 miles long, but only 7 or 8 miles of the south end are in this state. The rivers and lakes abound with various kinds of fish. Springs. \u2014 Besides the numerous springs of fresh water, there are some chalybeate springs. There is a spring in Orwel, near Mount Independence, and another at Bridport, which produce Epsom salts. There is also a mineral spring on some low land over against the great Ox Bow. Forests. \u2014 The greatest part of the state is still in forest, and the mountains will probably continue so for ages to come. Botany. \u2014 The forest trees comprise the different species of pine, maple, oak, ash, birch, beech, walnut, chestnut and poplar. The esculent trees, shrubs, and vines, are the varieties of the cherry, juniper, and the differentbush and vine berries and grapes. Medicinal and poisonous plants also abound in the mountains. Mineralogy. \u2014 Iron ore is found in several places, and there are some lead and copper mines. Porcelain earth is found at Monkton, and there are quarries of marble at Middlebury, Ben nington, Swanton, Arlington, Shaftesbury, and Pittsford. Natural Curiosities. \u2014 There are remarkable caves in Ply mouth, Clarendon, Dorset, Danby, and Benning'ton. The one in Plymouth, 18 miles west of Windsor, is situated at the foot of a mountain, near the head of Black River. It has five apart ments, one of which is 30 feet long, 20 broad, and 20 high ; and two of the others are nearly equal. The rocks which form the cavern are wholly of limestone. Numerous stalactites are found here, which resemble icicles hanging from the rocks. NEW HAMPSHIRE. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent.\u2014 New Hampshire lies between lat. 42\u00b0 41' and 45* 11' N. and between long. 70\u00b0 40' and 72\u00b0 28' W. It is 168 4"], [44, "38 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW I miles long, from north to south. Its greatest breadth is 90, and its least 10 miles, and it embraces an area of 9289 square miles. Boundaries.\u2014 North by Lower Canada ; east by Maine, and the Atlantic ; south by Massachusetts ; and west by the west bank of Connecticut River : no part of that river is within the jurisdiction of Vermont. The extent of sea coast is 18 miles. Divisions. \u2014 This state is divided into seven counties, viz. Cheshire, Coos, Graston, Hillsborough, Merrimack, Rocking ham, Stratford ; and 213 towns. Name. \u2014 This territory received the name of Neiv Hampshire from Capt. Mason, the original patentee. In the histories of the Indian wars, it is also called Capt. Mason's Patent, and Pisca taqua, from its principal river. Religion. \u2014 The principal denominations of Christians are Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Baptists, Me thodists, Universalists and Quakers. There is a small society of Sandemanians at Portsmouth, and Shakers at Enfield. Government. \u2014 The governor, senate, consisting of 12 mem bers, and the house of representatives, composed of one from each town, are all elected annually, by the males of full age paying state taxes. The judiciary is composed of a superior court, having four judges, which makes two circuits annually through the coun ties ; of an inferior court in each county, having four judges, and sitting four times in a year ; of a court of general sessions in each county, consisting of the justices of the peace, sitting the same week with the inferior courts ; of a court of probate in each county, having one judge, and sitting monthly ; and of justices' courts. Population. \u2014 The number of inhabitants was, in the year 1810, 214,460 ; in 1820, 244,161. Militia. \u2014 In 1818, the number of the militia was 25,794. Character. \u2014 The inhabitants of New Hampshire have the same general character as the New Englanders. They are tall and strong, industrious, well informed, enterprising, frugal, religious, and jealous of their rights. Literature. \u2014 The college of New Hampshire is in Hanover. It was called Dartmouth College from William, earl of Dart mouth, one of its principal benefactors ; and stands in a plain about half a mile east of Connecticut River. Connected with the college is Moore's Charity School. There are about 20 academies incorporated in the state. That at Exeter, called Phillips'' Exeter Academy, has funds amounting to about 80,000 dollars. . Every town is obliged by law to have one or more common schools. Towns. \u2014 Portsmouth, the largest town in the state, and the only seaport, had 7827 inhabitants in 1820. It is pleasantly situated on the south side of the Piscataqua, 3 miles from the Sea. It is well built, has a very excellent harbour, and a flour ishing commerce."], [45, "39 OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. Concord is the seat of government. It is pleasantly situated on the Merrimack, 45 miles north-west of Portsmouth, and con tains a large and elegant state-house of stone, and has consid erable trade. Dover, on Cocheco River, 12 miles north-north-west of Ports mouth, and Exeter, on Exeter River, 14 south-west of Ports mouth, are flourishing towns, and have considerable trade and manufactures. , The other considerable towns are Walpole, Claremont, Han over. Hopkinton, Salisbury, Londonderry and Durham. Manufactures. \u2014 It U chiefly an agricultural state. It has considerable manufactures of iron, cotton, woollen, &c, the whole annual value of which, in 1810, was estimated at 8,135,000 dollars. There has since that period been a rapid increase. The people generally manufacture their own clothing, and most of their domestic utensils and furniture. Trade. \u2014 The chief articles of export are timber of various kinds, dried and pickled fish, whale oil, tar, flaxseed, hemp, corn, oxen, horses, sheep, bricks, pot and pearl ashes. The amount, in 1822, was 200,000 dollars. The imports consist of West India rum, gin, molasses, wine, porter, sugars, tea, coffee, cotton, cheese, nails, cordage, steel, lead and grindstones. About 27 schooners, and 20 boats, with 250 men, are employed in the fisheries. The inhabitants in the south-west parts of the state trade with Boston ; in the middle and north, with Portsmouth ; and in the extreme north with Portland. Banks. \u2014 There are 10 incorporated banks in the state ; at Portsmouth, Dover, Exeter, Concord, Keene, Amherst and Ha verhill. Canals and Turnpikes. \u2014 Five canals have been formed on Connecticut River, two of which are in New Hampshire. By these the navigation on this river is opened for nearly 250 miles from its mouth. Several canals have been formed around falls in the Merrimack. Turnpike roads are constructed, inter secting the most important parts of the state. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The climate is severe, but healthy ; the ice lasts three months in the year on the lakes and rivers, which are then crossed by loaded wagons. Face ofthe Country. \u2014 The shore of New Hampshire is chiefly a sandy beach, within which are salt marshes intersected by creeks. The surface in the interior rises into mountains, which are clothed with wood, except their highest summits. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The ground is in general very fertile ; the uplands afford rich pastures, and the interval lands, along the rivers, heavy crops of hay and wheat. In the natural state, the varieties of soil may be distinguished by the growth of wood. Thus white oak and chestnut indicate a soil that is hard and stony ; pitch pine, one that is dry and sandy ; white pine, a soil"], [46, "40 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW light and dry, but deeper ; spruce and hemlock, a thin, cold soil ; beech and maple, a warm, rich, loamy soil. It is observed that winter rye thrives best on new land, and maize on loamy or old. Mountains. \u2014 New Hampshire is more distinguished for its mountains, than any other state in the Union. Of these the principal are the White Mountains, which display the most sub lime mountain scenery, surpassing every thing else of the kind in this country. They are covered with snow 9 or 10 months in the year, and derive their name from their white appoa.ra.no<r. They are seen many miles off at sea, and a person, when on their summit, has a distinct view of the Atlantic Ocean, the nearest part of which is 65 mUes distant, in a direct line. Mount Washington, the highest summit, is 6230 feet above the level of the sea. Moosehillock, in this range, is 4500 feet high. Sunapee is in the same chain farther south ; and still farther the Monadnoc, the height of which is 3254 feet above the sea ; its summit is a bald rock ; on some parts of it are large piles of broken rocks ; and the sides present volcanic appearances. Rivers. \u2014 The Merrimack is formed by two branches, about 100 miles from its mouth, and falls into the sea at Newburyport. This river, 8 miles below Concord, falls 15 feet in 30 rods, \u2014 which have been canalled. The Piscataqua is a stream of about 50 miles in length, and empties into the sea at Portsmouth. The other considerable rivers, besides the Connecticut, which is the west boundary of the state, are the Androscoggin, Saco, Upper and Lower Ammonoosuc, Souhegan River, Ashuelot, and Contoocook. Lakes. \u2014 Winnipiseogee, the largest lake, situated in the cen tral part of the state, is 23 miles long. It is a beautiful lake, of very irregular form, and is surrounded by the most romantic scenery. Other lakes are the Umbagog, Ossapee, Sunapee, Squam, and Newfound Lakes. Minerals. \u2014 Iron ore is found in great quantities at Franconia, where there are extensive iron works. Curiosities. \u2014 The Notch, or Gap, in the White Mountains, is esteemed one ofthe greatest natural curiosities in the United States. It is a narrow defile, extending two miles in length, between two huge cliffs, apparently rent asunder by some vast convulsion of nature. The road from Lancaster to Portland passes through this opening, following the course of the head branch of the Saco, which has its source in a pond of one or two acres, situated near the road. The entrance of the chasm is formed by two rocks standing perpendicularly, at the distance of only 22 feet from each other. The whole mountain, which otherwise forms a continued range, is here cloven quite down to its base, opening a free passage for the waters of the Saco. The Gap is so narrow, that space has been obtained with diffi culty for the road. The crags and precipices on both sides, rise."], [47, "41 OF MAINE. with great steepness, forming a support for the irregular ridges above. In the township of Franconia is a singular curiosity, called the Profile. The high peak on which it is situated rises ab ruptly, presenting a bold front of solid Tock, a side view of which exhibits a complete profile of the human face. In the township of Chester are two remarkable caves. One, called the Devil's Den, is in Mine Hill in the western part. The hill is half a mile in diameter, and about 400 feet high, almost perpendicular on the south side. The entrance of the cave, which is on the south side, is 10 yards above the base, and, after a passage, varying in its dimensions, 25 feet in length, opens into the principal apartment, which is 15 or 20 feet square, 3 or 4 feet high, floored and ceiled by a regular rock. From the ceiling are dependent numerous stalactites or excrescences, in the form of pears, whose polished surfaces reflect a torch light with innumerable hues and uncommon brilliancy. The other cave is on the west side of Rattle -snake Hill, 7 miles south-west of the meeting-house. The principal entrance is 1 1 feet high and 4 wide. It extends 20 feet into the side of the hill, and, after forming a semicircle of 53 feet in length, passes out the same side. Other curiosities are Bellows' Falls, on the Connecticut, at Walpole, and the Great Boar's Head, a promontory in Hampton. MAINE. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent and Boundaries. \u2014 Maine lies between lat. 43\u00b0 4' and 47\u00b0 50' N., and between lon. 64\u00b0 54' and 70\u00b0 40' W. Its shape is nearly that of a rhombus, and it contains 32,000 square miles. The eastern line, which separates this state from New Bruns wick, is 150 miles long ; the southern, on the Atlantic, 207 ; the western, which divides it from New Hampshire, 150 ; and the northern, dividing it from Lower Canada, 220. Divisions. \u2014 Maine is divided into nine counties, Cumberland, Hancock, Kennebec, Lincoln, Oxford, Penobscot, Somerset, Washington, York ; and has 243 towns. Religion. \u2014 The prevailing religious sects are Congregation alists and Baptists. There are some Methodists, Episcopalians, Catholics and Universalists. Government. \u2014 Maine was a dependency of Massachusetts until 1820, when it received a constitution as an independent state, and became a member of the federal body. The governor, senate, and house of representatives are all elected annually, by the male inhabitants of the age of 21 and upwards. Population.\u2014 The population, which, in 1790, amounted only to 96,540, was found to be 298,325 in 1820. Character. \u2014 Their character resembles that of the other in- 4*"], [48, "42 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW habitants of New England ; they are moral, active, industrious, and enterprising. Literature. \u2014 Bowdoin College, at Brunswick, is a respectable and flourishing institution, and has a medical school connected with it. At Waterville there is a college under the direction of the Baptists ; and at Bangor a literary and theological seminary, supported by the Congregationalists. There are schools in al most every township, besides twenty-five academies in the more populous places. Towns. \u2014 Portland is much the largest town in Maine, con taining, in 1820, 8,600 inhabitants. It is delightfully situated on a peninsula in Casco Bay, is well built, and has one of the best harbours in the world, and an extensive commerce. Bath, on the Kennebec, 13 miles from the sea; Hallow7ell, on the same river, about 27 miles above Bath ; and Brunswick, on the Androscoggin, 7 miles west of Bath, are flourishing towns, and have considerable trade. Eastport, in Passamaquoddy Bay, on the eastern border ofthe state, has a flourishing commerce. The other most considerable towns are Castine, Augusta, Wis casset, Bangor, Kennebunk, Saco and York. Manufactures. \u2014 The manufactures are chiefly domestic, and were estimated at 2,138,000 dollars in 1810. Commerce. \u2014 Maine enjoys great facilities for commerce. The coast is indented with bays, abounding in excellent harbours. A great part of the state is yet unsettled, and covered with forests. The chief exports are timber and fish. Banks. \u2014 The banks in Maine are the Portland, Maine, Lin coln and Kennebec, Saco, Hallowell and Augusta; and there are banks at Bangor and Waterville. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The climate, though severe, having five months of frost and snow, is remarkably healthy. The weather in this country is more regular in the winter than in the Southern States. Face of the Country. \u2014 The state of Maine is an elevated country, but rather uneven than hilly or mountainous. The land rises very gradually from the coast, and most is capable of cultivation. There is no range of mountains of any conse quence, except the high land on the southern frontier. Soil and Agriculture. \u2014 It contains much poor soil along the coast, but the land between the Kennebec and the Penobscot Rivers is excellent, and well adapted to tillage and pasture. Wheat, rye, oats and barley are cultivated ; but pasturage and the feeding of cattle are leading objects of attention. Bays and Harbours. \u2014 The most considerable bays are Casco, Penobscot, Frenchman's and Passamaquoddy. The harbours are Lubec, Machias, Goldsboro', Castine, Owlshead, Waldo boro', Bristol, Wiscasset, York, Portland, Saco and Kennebunk. Rivers. \u2014 The Penobscot rises from the lakes in the north west part of the state, and flows into Penobscot Bay. It is navigable to Bangor, 52 miles. above the mouth ofthe bay."], [49, "OF MASSACHUSETTS. 43 The Kennebec is formed of two branches ; one comes from Moosehead Lake. It flows into the ocean 13 miles below Bath, and is navigable, for vessels of 150 tons, to Hallowell, 40 miles ; and for boats to Waterville. This river waters a fine tract of country, and there are upon its banks several flourishing towns. The St. Croix is an inconsiderable stream, noticeable princi pally as a part of the eastern boundary of the United States. The other principal rivers are the Androscoggin and the Saco. Lakes. \u2014 Some of the most considerable lakes are the Moose head, the Umbagog, lying partly in New Hampshire, the Sebago, and the Schoodic. Islands. \u2014 The islands along the coast are numerous. Some of the principal are Long Island, Deer Island, Mount Desert, Seguin Island, and the Fox Islands. Mountains. \u2014 The Spencer Mountains lie east of Moose Lake, 8 or 10 miles distant. One of the summits is very high. Mount Kinio lies in a peninsula on the east side of Moosehead Lake, about midway from north to south. It is very high, and the east side is nearly perpendicular. Its substance is granite. Natural Curiosity. \u2014 In Hollis, on the north-west side of the Saco, is a spring, remarkable for the phenomena which it ex hibits. MASSACHUSETTS. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent.\u2014 This state lies between lat. 41\u00b0 23' and 43\u00b0 52' N., and between lon. 69\u00b0 50' and 73\u00b0 10' W. Its length, on the northern line, is 130 miles ; on the southern, from New York to Cape Cod, 190. Its breadth, in the west, is 50 miles ; farther east, it is almost 100 ; and on the cape it does not exceed 15. Boundaries. \u2014 Massachusetts is bounded on the north by Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts Bay; on the east by the same bay and the Atlantic ; on the south by the Atlantic, Rhode Island and Connecticut ; on the west by Rhode Island and New York. Divisions. \u2014 Massachusetts is divided into 14 counties, viz. Barnstable, Berkshire, Bristol, Duke's, Essex, Franklin, Ham den, Hampshire, Middlesex, Nantucket, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, Worcester ; and 300 towns. Name. \u2014 The name Massachusetts was aboriginal, and be longed to a numerous tribe of Indians, that lived in the neigh bourhood of Boston. The south-eastern part of the state was called Plymouth, or the Colony of Plymouth. In a few of the earliest grants, the north-eastern part ofthe state was called Ma riana. Many ofthe common people of New England have always called Massachusetts the Bay State, because, before the revolu tion, its name was the Colony, or Province, of Massachusetts Bay. Religion. \u2014 The Congregationalists are three times more nu merous in this state than any other sect. The next in number"], [50, "44 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW are the Baptists. There are also some Methodists, Episcopali ans, and Universalists. Government. \u2014 The executive consists of a governor, lieuten ant-governor, and a council of 9 members. The legislature, called also the general court, consists of a senate and house of representatives, chosen annually by the people. The judiciary is composed of a supreme court, of 5 judges, and sitting twice a year in each county ; county courts, having 5 judges ; a court of probate in each county ; and justices' courts. Population. \u2014 The population was 378,787 in 1790, and had increased to 523,287 in 1820. Massachusetts is the most densely peopled of any state in the Union. Militia. \u2014 The militia, embracing the greatest part of the active citizens between the ages of 18 and 45, armed and or ganized, amounted, in 1818, to 73,194. Banks. \u2014 There are more than 30 banks of discount and de posit in Massachusetts, 8 of which are in Boston, and the rest are scattered over the state. Manners. \u2014 The state of society in Massachusetts is gene rally desirable. Most of the inhabitants attend public worship on the Sabbath, and good order and sobriety prevail through the week. The great body of the people are agriculturalists, and are the proprietors ofthe soil. Literature. \u2014 The literary institutions of Massachusetts are well supported and flourishing. Harvard University in Cam bridge is the most ancient, best endowed, and most extensive literary institution in the United States. It comprises 4 depart ments, one for under-graduates, and one for students preparing for the professions of theology, law and medicine. There are, including all the departments, 20 professors; and the library, which is the largest in the United States, contains about 20,000 volumes. Williams' College is a respectable seminary at Williamstown, in the N. W. corner of the state. There is a flourishing college at Amherst, incorporated in 1826. At Andover, 20 miles N. of Boston, there is a richly endow7ed Theological Seminary, which has 4' professors, and about 140 students. Phillips' Academy, at the same place, is one of the best endowed and most respectable institutions of the kind in the Union. There are about 30 other academies in the state. By law e\\ ery town, containing fifty families, is bound to maintain a common English school ; and every town with 200 families is to maintain a school for Greek and Latin. Towns. \u2014 Boston, the capital of Massachusetts, is the literary and commercial metropolis of New England, and contains 43,940 inhabitants. It is built chiefly on a peninsula of uneven surface, at the head of Massachusetts Bay, and is nearly three miles long, and upwards of one mile, where widest, broad. It is connected with the main land by a narrow isthmus, called the Neck, leading to Roxbury. The harbour is excellent, and so capacious that 500 vessels may ride at anchor in good depth"], [51, "45 OF MASSACHUSETTS. of water ; while the entrance is so narrow as scarcely to admit two ships abreast. It is finely situated for commerce, and has more shipping than any other city in the United States, except New York, and is a place of great trade and opulence. It con tains 155 streets, 27 lanes, and about 80 wharves and quays. The city is irregularly laid out; many ofthe streets are narrow and crooked ; and in the north part the houses are mostly of wood, and many of them mean. But in the parts recently built, the streets are wider, and the private buildings display more elegance and splendour than in any other city in the Union. Among the public buildings are the state-house, the Massachu setts hospital, and 30 places of public worship. The state house, a large brick edifice, has a noble and commanding situa tion, on ground elevated about 100 feet above the level of the harbour, and is a very conspicuous object. It is 173 feet in front, and its dome is 50 feet in diameter, terminated by a cir cular lantern, at an elevation of 100 feet from its foundation. The prospect from the top is exceedingly magnificent and beau tiful, surpassing any thing of the kind in this country, and will bear a comparison with Castle Hill of Edinburgh, the famous Bay of Naples, or any other of the most picturesque scenes of Europe. Here may be seen at a view the city, with its ship ping and buildings ; the harbour, 6tudded with about 40 small islands ; Charles River ; a fine country, ornamented with elegant country seats, and more than 20 flourishing towns and villages. In front ofthe state-house is the Common, containing 44 acres, surrounded by the Mall, an extensive and most delightful public walk. On Central Wharf is an immense pile of building, 1,240 feet in length, 4 stories high, containing 54 stores, having a spa cious hall in the centre, on which is erected an observatory.. Boston may also be considered as the literary capital of the United States, so far as regards native publications, and no city of its size in the world is so well supplied with common schools. It has been distinguished in the history of this country, and took a conspicuous part in the revolution. Salem, 14 miles north-east of Boston, is a pleasant and hand some town, the second in New England in population, wealth, and commerce, and is largely concerned in the East India trade. The population is 13,000. Newburyport, on the Merrimack, 3 miles from the sea, and 24 north of Salem, is a handsome town, delightfully situated, and has considerable commerce. Marblehead, 4 miles south-east of Salem, is more largely concerned in the Bank fisheries than any other town in the United States. Population, 5,600. Beverly, connected with Salem by a bridge, and Gloucester, 16 miles north-east of Salem, are also largely concerned in the fisheries. Charlestown, connected with Boston by Charles River bridge, has considerable trade and manufactures, and contains the U.S."], [52, "46 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW navy yard, the state prison, and the Massachusetts insane hos pital. Population 6,600. Cambridge, 3 miles north-north-west of Boston, is a consider able town, and famous for its university. Plymouth, 36 miles south-south-east of Boston, is remarkable for being the oldest town in New England, and has considerable trade. The settlement was commenced in Dec. 1620, by 101 Puritans. Nantucket, on an island of the same name, carries on more trade in the whale fishery than anv other town in the Union. It contains upwards of 7,000 Inhabitants, nearly one half of whom are Friends. The whole number of whale ships owned here, in 1822, was 88. New Bedford, on an arm of the sea, which makes up from Buzzard's Bay, has considerable commerce, and is also largely concerned in the whale fishery. Population, 4,000. Worcester, 39 miles west by south of Boston, is a handsome town, and has an extensive inland trade. Springfield, on Connecticut River, 88 miles west by south of Boston, is a considerable and flourishing town, and contains a large United States armoury. Northampton, Greenfield, Pittsfield, Taunton, Dedham, Ha verhill, Concord, Roxbury, Medford, and many others, are very pleasant inland towns. Manufactures. \u2014 The amount of manufactures in this state, in 1810, was 21,900,000 dollars. The chief articles are cottons, articles of tanned leather, cordage, wrought and cast iron, nails, woollens, ships, straw bonnets, hats, cabinet work, flour, paper, oil, soap, muskets, bricks, carriages and duck. Lynn is the principal seat of the shoe manufacture ; West Cambridge and Boston, of card manufactories. Window glass and other glass ware, equal to any that is imported, is made at Boston. Commerce. \u2014 Massachusetts has the principal share of the fisheries, and a greater amount of commerce and shipping than any other state. The amount of exports, in the year 1822, was 12,599,000 dollars. In 1817, Massachusetts paid into the treas ury of the United States more than a seventh part of the reve nue. The chief exports are fish, beef, lumber, pork, ardent spirits, furniture, flax-seed, and the more important manufactures abovenamed. Canals. \u2014 There are two canals at South Hadley. Middlesex Canal connects the Merrimack with Boston. The whole dis tance is 30 miles. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Face ofthe Country. \u2014 The state is uneven and hilly generally, and mountainous near its western extremity. The south-eastern part of the state, including the counties of Plymouth, Bristol and Barnstable, is chiefly a plain. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The soil in the southern parts is"], [53, "47 OF MASSACHUSETTS. sandy ; in the rest ofthe state it is generally strong, and well adapted either for grazing or grain. The agriculture is better conducted than that of any other state, except Connecticut and Pennsylvania. The average produce, per acre, of the good lands, is estimated to be thirty bushels of corn, thirty of barley, twenty of wheat, fifteen of rye, and two hundred of potatoes. The ox is more used than the horse, in agriculture. Mountains. \u2014 The Taghconnuc range traverses the western tier of towns in the county of Berkshire ; the highest summit in this range is in Sheffield, and is 3000 feet high. The range of the Green Mountains extends from north to south through the western part of the state. Saddle Mountain, in Williamstown, is 4500 feet high, and is the highest land in the state. The Mount Tom range runs north-north-east to the southern line of Northampton, where Connecticut River passes between Mount Tom and Mount Holyoke. Mount Toin, the highest in the range, is 1320 feet above the river, and 1500 above the sea. Mount Holyoke, on the other side of the river, is about 250 feet lower than Mount Tom. From the top of it is presented a most extensive and delightful view of the country bordering on Connecticut River. The White Mountain range runs up through the county, of Hampshire, traversing the middle of the towns east of the river. Wachusett', in Princeton, is 2989 feet above the level of the sea. Rivers. \u2014 The Connecticut divides the counties of Hampshire, Hampden and Franklin. The Housatonic runs through most of Berkshiie, but is really a river of Connecticut. The sources of the Quinebog, a branch of the Thames, are also in this state. The Merrimack has been described. The Pawtucket also runs a considerable distance here. Taunton River rises in the north-east part of Plymouth, and pursues a south-west course to Narragansett Bay. Charles River heads in a pond in Hopkinton, and pursues a very circuitous route, but on the whole a north-east direction, to Boston harbour, where it enters, after passing Charlestown. The other rivers are the Mystic, Nashua, Concord, which feeds the Middlesex Canal, the Chicapee, Deerfield, Westfield, and Miller's. . Bays. \u2014 Massachusetts Bay lies between Cape Cod and Cape Ann. Barnstable Bav comprises the southern part of Massa chusetts Bay. Buzzard's Baylies on the south-west side ofthe peninsula of Cape Cod. Boston Bay sets up between Alderton and Nahant Points, about 8 miles. Capes. \u2014 The most noted capes are Cape Cod, Cape Ann, Cape Malabar, Cape Poge, Gayhead and Sandy Point. Peninsula. \u2014 The peninsula of Cape Cod comprises the qounty of Barnstable, the most easterly part of the state. It is mostly a sandy barren, and the inhabitants chiefly obtain their subsist ence from the seas. Islands. \u2014 The most considerable are Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, the Elizabeth Islands, and Plum Island."], [54, "48 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW Mineralogy. \u2014 Iron ore is abundant, particularly in the three south-eastern counties. Several mines of black lead have been discovered in Hampshire ; and quarries of marble in several places in Berkshire. Curiosities. \u2014 Lynn Beach, which is a mile and a half long, and connects the peninsula of Nahant with the main land, is regarded as a curiosity. Nahant is a remarkable promontory in the township of Lynn, 9 miles north-east of Boston by water, and 15 by land. It is a peninsula of a very irregular outline and surface, comprising about 550 acres. It is connected with the main land by a very narrow and straight isthmus, consisting of a delightful beach, of a mile and a half in length. Nothing can be finer than a ride over this smooth beach of hard sand, while the surf is rolling up alongside, and bursting in foam. The coast ofthe promontory is composed of ragged, precipitous rocks, which overhang the sea, and, on the southern shore, are more than 100 feet in height. Nahant commands a prospect over a large part of Massachusetts Bay, and presents some of the finest marine views that can be seen. After a storm, with an easterly wind, the foaming and dashing of the waves of the agitated ocean against the precipitous rocks, afford a most sub lime spectacle. In the hottest weather in the summer, the sea breezes are, on this peninsula, cool and refreshing. In Adams there is a singular chasm formed by a branch of the River Hoosac. This chasm is scooped into an endless vari ety of forms, some of them arched in the horizontal, and others in the perpendicular direction. The natural bridge, which lies over this stream, is formed of a huge mass of limestone. It is 14 feet long, 10 broad, and 62 feet high. About 20 feet directly under this bridge is another, of nearly the same dimensions. The stream runs from 20 to 30 feet below the lower bridge. RHODE ISLAND HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent. \u2014 This state is situated between 41\u00b0 17' and 42\u00b0 N. lat, and between 71\u00b0 6' and 71\u00b0 52' W. lon. Its north line is 29 miles long, and its west, 49. Rhode Island contains about 1580 square miles, and is the smallest state in the Union. Boundaries. \u2014 It is bounded north and east by Massachusetts ; south by the Atlantic ; and west by Connecticut. Divisions. \u2014 The state is divided into 5 counties, and 31 towns. Religion. \u2014 The Baptists are the most numerous denomina tion. The tenets of most of them are Calvinistic. The other denominations are Congregationalists and Episcopalians. The clergy are maintained by the voluntary contributions of their people. Government. \u2014 This state, unlike the other members of the Federal Union, has no written constitution, being still governed by the charter granted by Charles II. in 1631 ; in virtue of"], [55, "49 OF RHODE ISLAND. which the people annually elect a senate and house of repre sentatives, who exercise the legislative power, and a governor, who exercises the executive. Population. \u2014 The population ofthe state was 68,828 in 1790; and 83,059 in 1820. Militia.\u00b1-The militia in this state amounted, in 1817, to 8350 men, organized and disciplined in a manner simdar to the rest ofthe New England militia. Literature. \u2014 Brown University, a respectable and flourishing seminary, is at Providence. A majority of the trustees are Baptists. At the same place the Friends have a large boarding school. There are 9 academical schools in the state. Towns. \u2014 Providence, situated on Providence River, a little above the head of Narragansett Bay, 35 miles from the ocean, and 40 south-west of Boston, is the largest town in the state, and the third in size in New England, having, in 1820, 11,787 inhabitants. It is a handsome and flourishing town, has an ex tensive trade, and is distinguished for its manufactures. Newport, situated on the south-west end ofthe island of Rhode Island, 30 miles south of Providence, is celebrated for the beauty of its situation, the salubrity of its climate, for the great variety of its fish, and the excellence of its harbour, which is one ofthe best in the world. Bristol, 15 miles south of Providence, is a pleasant, wealthy, and commercial town. Warren, 4 miles north of Bristol, is a pleasant town, and has some commerce. Pawtucket, at the Falls, so called, 4 miles north-east of Prov idence, is a flourishing manufacturing village. Pawtuxet, 5 miles south of Providence, has considerable trade and manufactures. Manufactures. \u2014 Rhode Island, in proportion to its population, is the most considerable manufacturing state in the Union, con taining from 90 to 100 cotton mills, and a vast number of power looms. Commerce. \u2014 Its commerce is considerable, but chiefly with other parts of the United States. Banks. \u2014 There are more than 30 banks in this small state, more than one half of which number are in the three principal towns. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The climate is one of the most salubrious of the United States. It is somewhat damper than Connecticut. The winters are a little milder, but the north-east winds are more unpleasant, though less so than on the eastern coast. The summers are delightful. Face of the Country.\u2014 The northern and western parts are hilly and rocky, and the hills continue, though with small eleva tion, through the northern third of the state. The rest of the country is chiefly level. 5"], [56, "50 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW7 Soil and Productions.\u2014 The country bordering on Narragan sett Bay is, very fertile. In the northern and western parts, the sod is thin and lean. Agriculture is not very flourishing, except in the islands, which have been styled the Garden of New England. Grazing is an important occupation. , Rivers. \u2014 The principal rivers are the Pawtucket, Providence, Pawtuxet, Pawcatuck and Wood Rivers. Bays. \u2014 Narragansett Bay extends up siom south to north about 28 miles, intersecting the dtate. It is about 10 miles wide. Providence Bay sets up 15 miles north-north-west from Nar ragansett Bay, and is from 1 to 3 miles wide. Islands. \u2014 Rhode Island, from which the state takes its name, is 15 miles long, and on an average 34 broad, and, on account of its salubrity, fertility and beauty, has been styled the Eden of America. Other islands are Canonnicut, Prudence, Patience, Hope, Dyer's and Hog Islands, all included in Narragansett Bay ; and Block Island, off the coast, in the Atlantic. Mountain. \u2014 Mount Haup, or Mount Hope, on the west side of the bay of the same name, is an inconsiderable eminence, famous as the residence of King Philip. Mineralogy. \u2014 Iron is found in great plenty in several places. There is a mine in a valley near Pawtucket River, about 12 miles from Providence. Limestone is found in great abundance in Providence county ; and a valuable coal mine has recently been discovered in the north part of Rhode Island. , Curiosities. \u2014 The Falls of Pawtucket, at the village of that name, are much admired. The descent is about 50 feet. In Warwick, about 10 miles south-south-w7est of Providence, is a huge rock, so completely balanced upon another, that a bpy of 14 years of age may put it in motion. The sound produced by the collision is somewhat like that of a drum, though more sonorous, and may be heard, in a still evening, at a distance of 7 or 8 miles. Hence, from time immemorial, it has been called Drum Rock. It is much visited as an interesting curiosity. CONNECTICUT. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent.\u2014 This state lies between lat. 41\u00b0 and 42\u00b0 N. and be tween lon. 71\u00b0 29' and 73\u00b0 24' W. It contains 4674 square miles. Boundaries.\u2014 Bounded north by Massachusetts ; east by Rhode Island ; south by Long Island Sound ; west by New York. Divisions. \u2014 This state is divided into 8 counties, which are subdivided into 119 townships. Name.\u2014 The name1 of the state is derived from Connecticut River, a Moheakannew word, signifying long river. In the earliest records, the name is Quonehtacuf and Qvonehtiquot. Religion.\u2014 In 1818, there were 213 Congregational, 69 Epis-"], [57, "OF CONNECTICUT. 51 copalian, and 70 Baptist churches in the state. The Episcopal congregations average about 40 families, or 250 individuals; the Baptist congregations are about the same size ; those ofthe Congregationalists, about 1000 individuals. Liberty of con science, in its full extent, is enjoyed in Connecticut. Government. \u2014 The charter of Charles II. contained the con stitution till 1818. Till this period the legislature was styled the general assembly, and was composed of a council and house of representatives. The council consisted of a governor, lieuten ant-governor, ana 12 assistants. They were all chosen annually by the people. The new constitution does not materially alter the fundamental principles of the former, but reduces these principles to the customary form of a constitution. Population. \u2014 Its population has increased more slowly than any other state, being 237,946 in 1790, and 275,248 in 1820. Were it not for the tide of emigration, which is continually roll ing to the west, Connecticut would be unrivalled in the increase of its population. Militia. \u2014 The militia of this state amounted, in 1818, to 20,593. Composed of freemen and landholders, they would be formidable to any assailants of their rights. Revenue. \u2014 The funds ofthe state were, in 1811, 421,871 dol lars. This, added to the school fund, makes a sum total of near ly two millions. The state owes no debt of any kind whatsoever. Manners and Customs. \u2014 The inhabitants are, almost to a man, of English origin. Their ancestors emigrated from England to enjoy the blessings of civil and religious liberty. The institu tions, which they founded, have produced a happy state of society. There are few men very rich, and sow very poor : all the male. inhabitants, arrived to manhood, can read and write, and cast accounts ; and great numbers of them have a collegiate educa tion. Their houses, equipage, dress and food, are good, but plain and simple. The good order of the people is singular, particularly on public occasions. Banks- \u2014 There are 14 banks in the state, distributed among the principal towns of each county. Literature. \u2014 Connecticut is distinguished for its attention to education. , Yale College, in New Haven, is one of the most eminent and flourishing literary institutions in the United States. There are connected with it respectable medical and theological schools. Washington College, in Hartford, is now in its infancy, but its prospects are flattering. Hartford is also the seat of the first institution established in the country for the education of the deaf and dumb ; and of a Retreat for the Insane, designed for the whole state. . , There is at Middletown a respectable institution, called \" the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy.\" At Litchfield, 30 miles west of Hartford, is a respectable law school. There are in the state about 30 academies, of which those at Cheshire and Colchester are the most important. The"], [58, "52 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW state has a fund of nearly 2,000,000 dollars, the interest of which is appropriated to the support of common schools. Toivns. \u2014 There are five incorporated cities, Hartford, New Haven, New London, Middletown and Norwich. Hartford, pleasantly situated on the Connecticut, 50 miles from its mouth, at the head of sloop navigation, is well built, and has flourishing manufactures, and considerable trade. New Haven, situated on a bay which extends up from Long Island Sound, 34 miles south-west of Hartford, is a remarkably pleasant town, and has considerable commerce. The sessions, of the legislature are held alternately at Hartford and New Haven. New London, near the mouth of the Thames, has the best harbour in the state. Norwich, on the Thames, at the head of navigation, 14 miles north of New London, and Middletown, on Connecticut River, 14 miles south of Hartford, are both places of considerable im portance in trade and manufactures. Bridgeport, Stonington, Litchfield, Fairfield, Danbury, Wind ham, Weathersfield, Farmington, Windsor, East Windsor, Snf field, East Hartford, Haddam, and several others, are pleasant towns. Manufactures. \u2014 Connecticut is distinguished for manufactures, particularly of tin ware, which is sent into all parts of the United States. In East Hartford are glass works, a snuff and pow7der mill, paper mills and iron works. In Salisbury and Norwich are ex tensive iron works; and buttons, clocks and paper are manu factured in several towns. Ill Goshcn, Litchfield, and Simsbury, extensive woollen man ufactories have been established, and at New Haven is a large and splendid manufactory of fire arms. The amount, in 1818, was 7,800,000 dollars. Canals and Bridges. \u2014 There is a canal nearly completed, extending from New Haven, through Farmington, to Southwick. It is contemplated to continue it to Northampton, in Massachu setts, and thence to Vermont. An elegant bridge is built over the Connecticut at Hartford. It is built upon the chord of the arch, and is pronounced a specimen of finished workmanship. A bridge over the Housa tonic, at Stratford, is also a work of much beauty and excellence. Commerce. \u2014 There are five ports of entry in Connecticut. Almost all the produce of the western part of the state is entered at the New York custom-house, and the exports in the coasting trade are greater than those in the foreign. The amount of exports, in 1822, was $485,000. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate.- \u2014 No climate is probably more favourable to health and longevity than that of Connecticut. The winters in. gene ral are severe ; on the shore the weather is variable, in the in terior it is cold but serene. The north-west wind is cool, dry,"], [59, "OF CONNECTICUT. 53 and in a high degree refreshing. The north-east wind is damp, raw, and tempestuous. Most of the violent storms come with this wind. Face of the Country. \u2014 The shore is every where indented with small bays and harbours. The whole country is well wa tered with rivers and brooks. But a small part of the state is mountainous, and but little of it is level. The hills are of a moderate size, and occur in quick succession, furnishing an agreeable variety of prospects. Soil and Agriculture. \u2014 The great body of the state is excel lent land, fitted for all the purposes of agriculture. Much of it has been under cultivation for the greater part of a century, and still retains its original strength. The county of Fairfield is the best in the state, and the farmers there, as a body, are remarka bly thrifty and prosperous. The interval land on the Connecti cut, and some townships on the coast, are of a superior quality. Indian corn is the most abundant crop, and oats and flax are raised extensively. Immense numbers of neat cattle and swine are annually fattened, and the beef and pork of this state are of acknowledged excellence. The number of sheep has of late much increased, and the breed is improved since the introduction of Merinos by Col. Humphreys. Rivers. \u2014 The Connecticut, which has already been mention ed in the preceding states, runs through the counties of Hart ford and Middlesex, dividing the state into nearly equal parts. It is navigable for sloops and steamboats to Hartford, and for boats a considerable distance farther. A company has recently been incorporated, to improve the navigation of this stream, so as to render it the means of easy and direct transportation to the interior of Vermont. The Housatonic rises in Berkshire county, Massachusetts, and, running in a direction almost due south, enters Connecti cut between Canaan and Salisbury. About 7 miles from the line of the state, it is precipitated over a perpendicular fall 60 feet in height. This is the finest cataract in New England. This river pursues a southerly course through the state, and empties into Long Island Sound, between Milford and Stratford. Its whole length is about 140 miles. The Thames has two principal sources. The eastern takes its rise in a pond in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, and runs in a direction west of south, till it joins the western branch a little above Norwich. Below this 17 miles, it empties into the sound. The other considerable rivers are the Farmington and the Naugatuck. Mountains.\u2014 The Taghconnuc range, commencing in Ridge field, runs northward near the western line of the state. Mount Tom, the highest summit in the eastern branch of this range, is about 500 leet high. West Rock, the southern extremity of the east ridge of the Green Mountains, is a fine perpendicular bluff, frontino- south, 400 feet high, and two miles north-west of 5*"], [60, "54 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW New Haven. East Rock, the southern termination of the Mount Tom range, is a similar bluff, 370 feet high, at the same distance east-north-east of New Haven. The Blue Hills, in Southington, are three noble eminences in this range. The White Mountain range has no distinguished summits in Connecticut. Talcot Mountain is situated in Farmington, 8 miles west of Hartford. Near the summit is a lake of the purest water, about half a mile long, with a delightful villa close by it, built in the Gothic style, and forming a delightful summer house. One the summit, near the edge of the precipice, stands a hexagon tower, 55 feet in height, and the top of which is 960 feet above the level of the Connecticut. This spot is called Monte Video, and is remarkable for the beauty of its scenery, and for its extensive and delightful prospects. The diameter of the view, in two di rections, is more than 90 miles, and comprises the spires of more than 30 of the nearest towns and villages. Botany. \u2014 The forest trees of Connecticut are the white, black, red, and mountain oak ; chestnut ; white, bitter, and shag bark walnut ; butternut ; white and swamp ash ; red and sugar maple ; buttonwood ; white, yellow, and pitch pine ; red, white, and yellow willow ; beech ; white and black poplar ; birch ; bass wood ; fir; and hemlock. Mineralogy. \u2014 Iron mines are found in Salisbury, Canaan, Colebrook, Stafford, Kent, and Ridgefieldpand the metal is abundant. Lead ore is found in Milford. Copper ore has been found in Fairfield. There is a mine of cobalt in Chatham, and antimony has been dug in Glastenbury. Marble abounds in Washington, New Milford and Canaan. A quarry of superior beauty has been discovered in Milford, near New Haven. There are excellent quarries of freestone in Chatham, East Windsor, and other places. Mineral Waters.\u2014 At Stafford, 25 miles east of Hartford, is* chalybeate spring, which is the most celebrated fountain of mineral waters in the Eastern States. NEW YORK. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent.\u2014 This state lies between lat. 40\u00b0 40' and 45\u00b0 N., and between long. 73\u00b0 and 79\u00b0 55' W. The length of the state, on the parallel of 42\u00b0, is 340 miles. The greatest breadth, from north to south, is 300 miles. The number of square miles, exclusive of the islands, is 45,000. Boundaries. \u2014 Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Long Island Sound, bound it on the south. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont, from which it is separated by Lake Champlain, bound it on the east ; and it has Lower Canada, the St. Lawrence, Lake Ontario, Niagara River and Pennsylvania, on the north and west. This is the only state which extends across the whole United States, from the Atlantic to the western waters."], [61, "55 OF NEW YORK. Divisions. \u2014 New York is formed into four districts, which are divided into counties. The counties are subdivided into 560 townships. Southern District, \u2014 King's, New York, Queen's, Richmond, Suffolk, West Chester, Brooklyn. Middle Dishict, \u2014 Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster. East District, \u2014 Albany, Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Hamilton, Montgomery, Renselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Warren, Washington. Western District, \u2014 Alle ghany, Broome, Cataraugus, Cayuga, Chatauque, Chenango, Courtlandt, Erie, Genesee, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Livings ton, Madison, Monroe, Niagara, Oneida, Onondaga, Ontario, Oswego, Otsego, Schoharie, Seneca, Steuben, St. Lawrence, Tioga, Tompkins, Wayne, Yates. Name. \u2014 New York and the adjoining territories were origi nally called New Virginia. The Dutch gave, in 1614, to this state the name of New Netherlands. This name it retained till 1664, when it was called New York, in honour of the duke of York. Religion. \u2014 The prevailing religious sects are the Presbyte rians, Baptists, Episcopalians, Methodists, Dutch Reformed, German Lutherans, Quakers, &c. \u2014 all of which support their own preachers without receiving any assistance from the state. Government. \u2014 The constitution, as amended in 1821, vests the legislative power in a senate and house of representatives, elected, the former for four years, the latter for one, by all the free citizens paying state taxes. The executive is composed of a governor, lieutenant-governor, and council of appointment. The governor is chosen every three years. Population. \u2014 The population, in the interval between 1790 and 1820, increased from 340,120, to 1,372,812,\u2014 a rate of in crease not paralleled in any ofthe old states. Militia. \u2014 The whole number of males, between the age of 18 and 45, was, in 1819, 180,652. The official return was, infantry, 109,274; artillery, 7,326; light artillery, 754 ; cavalry, 1,142; total, 118,496. Revenue.\u2014 The revenue, in 1815, amounted to 14,492,000 dollars. It is derived chiefly from duties on foreign goods. The state has, since the above date, advanced about five millions to construct the Erie Canal, which was finished in 1825. The tolls, in the year 1826, produced the enormous amount of 771,780 dollars. This will require but a few years to reimburse the whole expense of its construction. After that period, it will be a source of immense revenue to the state. Character. \u2014 The manners and character of the inhabitants of every colony or state will take their colouring, in a greater or less degree, from the peculiar manners of the first settlers. Hence it is that the neatness, economy and industry of the Dutch were early imitated by the first English settlers in this province, and, until the revolution, formed a distinguishing trait in their character. It is still discernible, though in a less de gree, and will probably continue visible for some years to come."], [62, "56 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW Probably two-thirds of the population of this state are now de scendants of New Englanders, and they retain much of the New England character. The character and manners of this large and respectable state are rapidly improving, and it has a large body of men in the several professions of distinguished eminence and worth. Literature. \u2014 According to a report made to the legislature in March, 1824, there were in the state, in 1823, no less than 7382 common schools, at which were educated 400,534 persons, being 27,000 more than the wdiole number of children between the ages of 5 and 15, and actually exceeding one fourth of the population. In no other country in the world, as the reporter observes, is the proportion of persons attending schools near so large. There are besides, 40 academies, and 5 colleges, which receive about a million of dollars annually. The University of New York, in New York city, is composed of Columbia College, a respectable seminary, and a flourishing medical institution. Union College, at Schenectady, with regard to the number of students and its endowments, is one of the most considerable institutions in the United States. Hamilton College, at Clinton, 9 miles west of Utica, is a flourishing seminary. At West Point, on the Hudson, 58 miles north of New York, is a military academy, under the direction of the national gov ernment. There is a theological seminary, supported by the Episcopa lians, in the city of New York, another at Auburn, by the Pres byterians, and another at Hamilton, by the Baptists. The New York Institution for the instruction of the Deaf and Dumb went into operation in 1818. Towns. \u2014 New York, the principal town in the state, is the greatest commercial emporium in America, and is, perhaps, second only to London in the magnitude of its trade. It is finely situated at the south end of Manhattan Island, at the head of a beautiful bay, nine miles long, and has an admirable har bour, capable of admitting vessels of any size close to the quays. The city extends about three miles along the harbour, and four miles along East River, and its progress has been so rapid that its population, which was only 33,131 in 1790, amounted to 123,706 in 1820. It is less regular in its plan than Philadelphia, but its situation is more picturesque and commanding. The houses are of brick, and many of them handsome. There are 100 places of worship, some of which are elegant. The city is adorned with several other fine buildings, the most celebrated of which is the town hall. It is situated at the head of a handsome common, called the Park, near Broadway. It is built of white marble, and cost upwards of 500,000 dollars. The principa' street is Broadway. It is three miles long, 80 feet wide, gen erally well built, and a part of it is very splendid. The Battery is a beautiful public walk, on the southern extremity, of the"], [63, "57 OF NEW YORK. island. The city, together with the surrounding objects, pre sents a magnificent and beautiful view in approaching it through the Narrows,. New York contains numerous literary, scientific and charita ble institutions. Albany is situated on the west side of the Hudson, 6 miles below Troy, and 160 above New York. It is the seat of gov ernment of the state of New York, aud, in point of wealth, pop ulation and trade, the second city in the state. Its population is about 13,000. Among tho public buildings, are a state-house and academy, both large edifices of stone ; a state arsenal, and 11 houses of public worship. A large proportion of the houses are of brick. Albany has a pleasant and advantageous situation near the head of tide water. The grand canal from the Hudson to Lake Erie commences here. Troy is a beautiful and very flourishing town, on the east bank of the Hudson, 6 miles north from Albany. It contains 5300 inhabitants. Hudson, at the head of ship navigation, on Hudson River, 30 miles below Albany, has considerable trade, and New7burgh, Poughkeepsie, Catskill, Athens, Lansingburgh and Waterford, all on the Hudson, are considerable towns. Schenectady, on the Mohawk, 15 miles north-west of Albany, is celebrated for its college. Utica, near the centre of the state, on the Mohawk River and the Erie Canal, 93 miles west of Albany, is a handsome and flourishing town, and has an extensive trade. Rochester, at the Falls ofthe Genesee, where the Erie Canal crosses the river, is a very thriving town, and has a brisk trade. Auburn, a flourishing town at the north end of Owasco Lake, contains a state prison. Buffalo is a thriving town, at the point where the canal meets the east end of Lake Erie. There are many other flourishing towns, among which are Brooklyn and Sag Harbour, on Long Island ; Plattsburgh and Whitehall, on Lake Champlain ; Sackett's Harbour, on Lake Ontario ; Geneva, on Seneca Lake ; Ithaca, on Cayuga Lake ; Canandaigua, on Canandaigua Lake ; Cooperstown, on Otsego Lake ; and Lockport, toward the west end of the Erie Canal. Manufactures. \u2014 According to returns made in 1821, 10,039,804 yards of cloth, of cotton, woollen or linen, were made in the state that year. There were, at the same period, 184 cotton and woollen manufactories, 172 trip hammers, and 4304 saw mills. In 1810, there were 28 paper mills ; nail manufactories, 44 ; forges, 48 ; trip hammers, 49 ; and sugar houses, 10. The quantity of salt made in that year was 525,000 bushels. Since that time, the manufacture of these articles has greatly increas ed. Silk, to the amount of 2240 skeins, has been made in a year at Cayuga. The article of yarn has exceeded in value that of any other, and, within three years, has been manufactured, in the towns on the canal, to a very great extent."], [64, "58 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW Canals.\u2014 -The Erie Canal is by far the most magnificent work of the kind ever undertaken in America, and is much longer than any canal in Europe. It extends from Buffalo to Albany, forming a communication between Lake Erie and the Hudson, and is 305 miles in length. It is 40 feet wide at the top, 28 at the bottom, 4 feet deep, and has an aggregate rise and fall of 654 feet, which is effected by 81 locks. The Northern Canal extends from Whitehall, at the south end of Lake Champlain, to Fort Edward, on the Hudson, and it is continued on the west side of the Hudson till it unites with the Erie Canal, a few miles above Albany. The whole length is 62 miles. Banks. \u2014 There were, in 1819, (including branches,) upwards of 40 banks in this state, '30 of which had capital to the amount of 24,000,000 dollars. Since the above date, the number has considerably increased. Commerce. \u2014 New York exceeds all the other states in the advantages of its situation, in its resources from agriculture and commerce, in the arhount of its exports, and the number of its inhabitants. \u2022 The amount of exports, in 1822, was 17,100,000 dollars. The shipping, in 1821, was 249,000 tons. About half the foreign com modities used in the United States ace imported at New York. Bridges. \u2014 A bridge built across the Cayuga Lake is a mile long, and cost 25,000 dollars. The Cohoes bridge, across the Mohawk, 10 miles north of Albany, is 960 feet long, and 24 broad, and is supported by 13 solid stone pillars. There is another over the same river, at Schenectady, of about the same length. There is also a fine bridge over the Hudson, at Water ford. A bridge at Carthage, Ontario county, over the Genesee River, is a wonderful effort of human genius. The banks on each side ofthe river are of 200 feet perpendicular height, and 350 feet apart. The bridge, resting upon abutments of solid rock, consists of a single arch thrown across this awful chasm, the centre of which is 270 feet above the water. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The climate isconsiderably diversified. It is cold in the north, toward the St. Lawrence ; but milder in the south east, and in the country lying along the southern shores of Lake Ontario Face of the Country.- \u2014 The country displays every variety of surface, from the level and undulating to the hilly and moun tainous. The western part is mostly a level or moderately un even country. Soir! and Agriculture. \u2014 A great part of the state has a good soil ; and a considerable proportion of it is very fertile. It is well adapted to the various purposes of agriculture ; and much of it is excellent grazing. Wheat is raised more extensively than all other grains. Next to this is maize, and rye, the latter principally for the distilleries,"], [65, "59 OF NEW YORK. Mountains.\u2014 The Catskill Mountains, which are the principal range, present very interesting scenery. From a small lake, elevated upwards of 2,000 feet, issues a mill stream, which has a cataract of near 300 feet. , Rivers. \u2014 The Hudson is principally a long, narrow arm of the sea. It rises in the northern part of New York, between Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence. It is a remarkably straight river, and its course is from north to south. Its length is 250 miles. It is navigable for ships, 130 miles, to Hudson; and, for sloops of 30 tons, 30 miles farther, to Albany. The Mohawk rises north of Fort Stanwix, or Rome, 8 miles from Black River, and, running south 20 miles to the site of the old fort, then turns eastward. Its course is thence east by south, 130 miles, to the Hudson, into which it empties opposite Lansingburgh, 169 miles above New York. The other princi pal rivers are the St. Law7rence, the Genesee, Niagara, Oswego, Tioga, Susquehannah, Alleghany, Salmon, and Saranac. Lakes. \u2014 The state abounds, beyond any others, in beautiful and picturesque sheets of water. Lake Champlain, 128 miles long, and from half a mile to 12 miles broad, is chiefly in New York. It affords good navigation for steamboats, and has a considerable amount of shipping. Lake George is a body of transparent water, 36 miles long, environed by mountains, with very romantic scenery, and is ac counted the most beautiful lake in the Union. A series of long and narrow lakes, all extending in a south and north direction, and surrounded by eminences richly cloth ed with wood, adorn the fertile country south of Lake Ontario. The largest are, Oneida Lake, 22 miles long ; Seneca Lake, 85 miles ; Cayuga, 36 miles ; Canandaigua, 16 miles ; Crooked Lake, 20 miles; Skeneateles, 14 miles; Owasco, 11 miles; and Onondaga, 9 miles. They are almost all situated on the courses of rivers, and are generally na'dgable. Islands. \u2014 The principal islands are, Long Island, extending east of the city of New York, about 140 miles long, and about W, on an average, broad ; Staten Island, 18 miles long, lying west of New York Bay ; Manhattan, or York Island, on which the city of New York stands ; and Grand Island, in Niagara River. Salt Springs.\u2014 There are several salt springs, but the most important are those of Salina, on Onondaga Lake, 50 mUes west of Utica. The salt works here have produced upwards of 600,000 bushels of salt in a year. Mineral Waters.\u2014 The Saratoga and Ballston Springs are the most celebrated in America. Ballston is 26 miles north of Albany, and Saratoga 7 miles north-north-east of Ballston. These springs, during the hot season, are visited from all parts of the United States, by gay and fashionable people, as well as by invalius. Large quantities of the Saratoga and Ballston waters are bottled during the summer months, and sent to the cities on the coast. Considerable quantities are also exported to the West Indies and to Europe."], [66, "60 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW At New Lebanon, 27 miles south-east of Albany, are warm springs, which are visited for bathing. In the township of Wales, about 15 miles east-south-east of Buffalo, near the bank of a small stream, there issues from a ledge of slate rock a stream of air, which, on the application of a torch, takes fire. When set on fire, it continues to burn till it is extinguished by the rising of the water of the rivulet. It has continued burning for several weeks at a time. The flame is about six inches in length, and 2\u00a3 in diameter. There are, be sides, several other mineral and sulphur springs. Minerals. \u2014 Iron ore is found iii abundance\" in various places. Gypsum, limestone, marble, slate, lead, &c. occur in different places. Curiosities. \u2014 The Falls of Niagara have been already de scribed. Trenton Falls, on West Canada Creek, 12 miles north of Utica, are a succession of beautiful cataracts, accompanied with very interesting scenery. On the Mohawk, 2 miles from its mouth, are the falls called the Colioes. The river descends in one sheet nearly 70 feet, forming a beautiful cataract. On Salmon River, about ten miles above its entrance into Lake Ontario, is a cataract of 110 feet perpendicular. There are 4 great cataracts on the Genesee. The largest is below Rochester, 5 miles above its entrance into Lake Ontario, and is 96 feet perpendicular. Baker's and Glen's Falls on the Hudson, Adgate's Falls on Sable River, the falls on Black River, and Fall Creek, are all objects of interest. The stone bridge in Chester, the split rock on Lake Cham plain, the Ridge road, extending from the Genesee to Lewiston, and an extraordinary cavern in Watertown, are all regarded as curiosities. NEW JERSEY. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent. \u2014 New Jersey is situated between lat. 39\u00b0 and 41\u00b0 24' N., and between lon. 74\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 29' W. It is 160 miles long, from north to south. Its least breadth, in the centre, is 42 miles ; the greatest breadth, in the north, is 70, and in the south, 75 ; and it occupies an area of 5900 square miles. Boundaries. \u2014 On the north is New York ; on the east and south-east it has Hudson River, New York Bay, and the At lantic Ocean ; on the south-west and west, Delaware Bay and River, which separate it from the states of Delaware and Penn sylvania. Divisions. \u2014 The state is divided into 13 counties and 116 towns. The counties are Bergen, Burlington, Cape May, Cum berland, Essex, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Salem, Somerset, Sussex. Name. \u2014 In the original patent, by the duke of York, to Lord"], [67, "61 OF NEW JERSEY. i Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, the province is called Nova C\u00e6saria, or New Jersey. This name was given in compliment to Sir George, whose family came from the Isle of Jersey. Religion. \u2014 The Presbyterians are the most numerous denomi nation. Next are the Dutch Reformed, the Baptists, Methodists and Friends. Government. \u2014 The legislature is composed of a legislative council and house of assembly. The council is chosen annually, and consists of 13 members, one from each county. The assem bly consists of 35 members. The executive is composed of a governor, chosen by a joint of the legislature ; a vice-president, chosen by the coun cil ; and a privy council, consisting of any three members ofthe legislative council. Population. \u2014 The population was 184.139 in 1790, and 277,575 in 1820. Militia. \u2014 The militia of New Jersey, according to the returns of 1820, consisted of infantry, 31,274 ; of cavalry, 1,652 ; of ar tillery, 784; total, 33,710. In 1818, the militia amounted to 35,169. Manners and Customs. \u2014 Many circumstances concur to ren der these various in different parts of the state. The inhabitants are a collection of Low Dutch, Germans, English, Scotch, Irish, and New Englanders, or their descendants. The different re ligious sects have each their distinguishing characteristics, either in their worship, discipline or dress. The people of New Jersey are generally industrious, frugal, and hospitable. There are comparatively but few men of learn ing among them. The poorer classes are too inattentive to the education of their children, who are generally left to grow up in ignorance. There are, however, a number of gentlemen of the first rank in abilities and learning, in the civil offices ofthe state, and in the several learned professions. Literature. \u2014 At Princeton, 10 miles north-east of Trenton, is the college of New Jersey, called Nassau Hall, one ofthe most respectable in the United States. At the same place there is also a flourishing theological seminary, under the direction of the general assembly of the Presbyterian church. At New Brunswick, there is an institution, formerly called Queen's Col lege, founded by ministers of the Dutch church. It has recently revived, and taken the name of Rutger's College, and is in a prosperous condition. A theological institution has also been attached to this college, which is highly respectable. \u2014 There are in the state about 20 academies. Towns. \u2014 Trenton is the seat of government. It is a pleasant town, situated at the Falls ofthe Delaware, 30 miles north-east of Philadelphia, and contains a handsome state-house. Popu lation, 4,000. Newark, on the Passaic, 9 miles west of New York, is a re markably pleasant town, and has considerable manufactures and trade. Population, 6,500. 6"], [68, "62 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW New Brunswick, on the Raritan, 33 miles south-west of New York, is one ofthe most commercial towns in the state. Popu- lation, 6,700. Elizabethtown, near Newark Bay, 5 miles south of Newark, is a pleasant town. Population, 3,500. Burlington is situated on the Delaware, 17 miles north-east of Philadelphia. Population, 2,700. Patterson, on the Passaic, near the falls, 15 miles north-west of New York, is a flourishing manufacturing town. Population, 2,200. The \u00c6ther most considerable towms are Amboy, Princeton, Bridgetown and Salem. Roads and Bridges. \u2014 A turnpike road, 43 miles long, has been made from Trenton, through New Brunswick to Elizabeth- town. The greatest angle of descent is 3 degrees. It is nearly in a straight line, 36 feet wide, 15 of which are covered with gravel, 6 inches deep. A neat wooden bridge, near the Hackin- sac, 1000 feet long, and another over the Passaic, 500 feet long, have been erected at great expense. Another bridge over the Raritan, opposite New Brunswick, about 1000 feet in length, is also a work of great labour and expense. Manufactures. \u2014 This state has a considerable proportion of manufactures, particularly of iron, cotton, and leather. The amount of the manufactures, in 1810, was 7,000,000 dollars. Commerce. \u2014 This state has very little commerce. The ex ports are mostly through the cities of New York and Philadel phia ; and these cities import almost all the foreign articles con sumed in the state. The aggregate of shipping, in 1821, was .35,000 tons. The amount of exports, in 1822, was 83,000 dollars. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Face of the Country. \u2014 The southern part df the country is very level ; farther north, it becomes diversified ; and the north ern part is mountainous. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The level country is mostly sandy and barren ; but a great proportion of the other part has a good soil, excellent for grazing and the various purposes of agriculture. Orchards abound in the northern division, and New Jersey is famous for its excellent cider and fruits. Maple sugar is made in considerable quantities in the county of Sussex. Mountains. \u2014 The South Mountain, which is one ridge of the Alleghany range, crosses this state in about lat. 41\u00b0. This mountain embosoms such amazing quantities of iron ore, that it may not improperly be called Iron Mountain. The Kittatinny ridge passes through this state, north of the South Mountain. The noted highlands of Neversink and Cen tre Hill, are almost the only hills within the distance of many miles from the coast. \u2022 Rivers. \u2014 The Delaware and the Hudson are on its frontiers. Wallkill, a branch ofthe Hudson, rises in Sussex county. Raritan River is formed by two considerable streams, called"], [69, "63 OF PENNSYLVANIA. the north and south branches ; it passes by Brunswick and Am boy, and mingles with the waters of the Arthur Kuil Sound, and helps to form the fine harbour of Amboy. It is a mile wide at its mouth, 250 yards at New Brunswick, and is navigable about 16 miles. The Passaic is a very crooked river. It ri9es in a pond in Orange county, New York, and runs about 20 miles before it enters New Jersey. Pursuing a southerly direction, it falls into Newark Bay, after a course of about 65 miles. Hackinsac River runs in a direction parallel with the Hudson for 40 miles, and falls into Newark Bay a little distance east of the Passaic. It is navigable 15 miles. Bays. \u2014 Delaware Bay is the south-western boundary of the state, and New York Bay lies west of Bergen Neck. Amboy Bay, between Staten Island and Middleton, is about 15 miles deep, and, in the widest part, 12 broad. Botany. \u2014 The natural growth, in the northern half of the state, consists of the various kinds of oak, walnut, and maple, of the chestnut and birch. In some of the southern counties, almost tho only trees are shrub oak and yellow pine. Minerals. \u2014 Iron ore is found in great abundance, and iron in large quantities is manufactured. Carioritiex. \u2014 At Patterson are falls on the Passaic, of 72 feet perpendicular, much visited and admired on account of their beauty and grandeur. In the township of Shrewsbury, in Monmouth county, on the side of a branch ofthe Neversink River, is a remarkable cave, in which there are three rooms. The cave is about 30 feet long, and 15 broad. Each of the rooms is arched ; the centre of the arch is about 5 feet from the bottom of the cave, the sides not more than 24. PENNSYLVANIA. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent. \u2014 The shape of this state is more regular than any other in the Union, except Connecticut. Its northern and southern lines are chiefly in two parallels, and its western is a meridian line. The greatest length is 307 miles, from east to west, and ther common breadth, between the two paraUels, is 160 miles. It lies between lat. 39\u00b0 42', and 42\u00b0 17', N., anJ between lon. 74\u00b0 32', and 80\u00b0 27', W. Boundaries. \u2014 Bounded on the north by Lake Erie and New York ; east by New York and Delaware River, which separates it from New York and New Jersey ; on the south by the states of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia ; and on the west by Vir ginia and Ohio. Divisions. \u2014 The state is divided into 51 counties, and 651 townships."], [70, "64 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW Name.\u2014 The name of this state is merely that of the original proprietor, Penn, and a common termination, sylva, a forest or wood, annexed. Religion.\u2014 Of 500 congregations in this state, in 1816, only 97, or about one fifth, belonged to the Quakers or Friends. There were, at the same period, 86 congregations of Presbyte rians, 94 of German Calvinists, 74 of German Lutherans, 60 of Baptists, 26 of Episcopalians, and a few other sects. Population. \u2014 The population of Pennsylvania was, in 1820, 1,049,458. Government. \u2014The legislative power is vested in a senate and house of representatives. The senate cannot consist of a less number than one fourth, nor a greater than one third that of the house of representatives. The senators hold their offices four years, and one fourth of them are chosen in each year. The number of representatives cannot be less than 60, nor more than 100. The executive is vested in a governor, who must be 30 years of age, and have resided in the state seven years next before his election. He is elected for three years, and cannot be chosen more than 9 years out of 12. Militia.\u2014 For a great number of years, there was no militia in the state, the Quakers acting rigidly on the principle of not bearing arms. In 1818, the number of militia was 118,018. Character. \u2014 There is nothing to give the inhabitants a com mon character. About half the inhabitants are of English and New England origin, about a fourth German, and an eighth- Irish. The rest are Scotch, Welsh, Swedes and Dutch. These various classes retain, in a great degree, their own national char acter. The Germans are noted for their temperance, industry, and economy. The diversities of religion here are very great. Literature. \u2014 The University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, consists of four departments, \u2014 of art, medicine, natural science and law. The medical department of the university is the most distinguished and flourishing institution of the kind in the Union. The other colleges are Dickinson College, at Carlisle ; Wash ington College, at Washington ; Jefferson College, at Cannons burg ; and Alleghany College, at Meadville. The Moravians have flourishing schools at Bethlehem, Nazareth and Litiz.. Provision has been made for establishing an academy in every county. Towns. \u2014 Harrisburg is the seat of government. It is pleas antly situated on the Susquehannah, 98 miles west of Philadel phia. It is a handsome town, and contains a magnificent states house. Population, 3,000. Philadelphia is pleasantly situated between the Delaware and Schuylkill, 6 miles above their confluence, and 126 miles from the Atlantic, by the course of the river and bay. It is one of the most regular cities in the world, handsomely built of brick, and is a place of great trade and opulence, and, with regard to manufactures, exceeds all other cities in the United States, It,"], [71, "65 OF PENNSYLVANIA. Contains 60 houses of public worship, many other public build ings, and numerous literary and humane institutions. The Philadelphia prison is a more interesting object of humanity than tlie most gorgeous palaces ; it presents the practical appli cation of principles, which worldly men have derided, and phi losophy has upheld without daring to hope for their adoption. The exterior of the building is simple, with rather the air of an hospital than a gaol. \" On entering the court,\" says an intelli gent traveller, \"I found it full of stone cutters, employed in sawing and preparing large blocks of stone and marble ; smiths' forges were at work on one side of it, and the whole court is surrounded by a gallery and double tier of work-shops, in which were brushmakers, tailors, shoemakers, weavers, all at their several occupations, labouring not only to defray to the public the expenses of their confinement, but to provide the means of their own honest subsistence for the future. I passed through the shops, and paused a moment in the gallery to look dowrn on the scene below : it had none of the usual features of a prison house ; neither the hardened profligacy, which scoffs down its own sense of guilt, nor the hollow-eyed sorrow, which wastes in a living death of unavailing expiation : there was neither the clank of chains, nor yell of execration ; but a hard-working body of men, who, though separated by justice from society, were not supposed to have lost the distinctive attributes of human nature ; they were treated as rational beings, operated upon by rational motives, and repaying this treatment by improved habits, by in dustry, and by submission. They had been profligate, they were sober and decent in behaviour; they had been idle, they were actively and usefully employed ; they had disobeyed the laws, they submitted (armed as they were with all kinds of utensils) to the government of a single turnkey, and the barrier of a sin gle grating. The miracle which worked all this was humanity, addressing their self-love through their reason. I envied Amer ica this system : I felt a pang that my own country had neither the glory to have invented, nor the emulation to have adopted it.\" The population of Philadelphia, in 1820, was 114,410. Pittsburg is situated in the western part of the state, at the confluence ofthe Alleghany with the Monongahela, which unite to form the Ohio. It has great advantages by its situation, hav ing a communication with the Western States, and with New Orleans, by the Ohio and Mississippi ; and the country around abounds with coal. It is the centre of an extensive trade, and one of the greatest manufacturing towns in the Union. Popu lation, 7200. Lancaster is situated in a very pleasant and highly-cultivated country, 62 miles west of Philadelphia. It is a beautiful town, and has an extensive inland trade. Population, 6600. Reading, on the Schuylkill, 54 miles north-west of Philadel phia, is a pleasant town, and has considerable trade and manu factures. Population, 4300. Carlisle, 15 miles west of Harrisburg ; York, 22 miles west- 6*"], [72, "66 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW south-west of Lancaster; and Chambersburg, 52 miles west of York, are all considerable and flourishing towns. Among the other principal towns are Columbia, Marietta, Sunbury, Northumberland, Milton and Wilkesbarre, on the Sus quehannah ; Germantown, Easton and Bethlehem, in the eastern part of the state ; Brownsville, Washington, Union, Cannons burg and Meadville, in the western. Manufactures. \u2014 Pennsylvania exceeds all the other states in the variety and extent of its manufactures. The principal seats ofthe manufactures are Philadelphia and Pittsburg. The man ufactures of iron, established at Pittsburg; on the western side of the Alleghanies, are considerable in amount, and progressively increasing, in consequence of the local advantages of the place, which is situated in the midst of abundant mines of iron and coal, and has great facilities for the transportation of its products by the Ohio. The amount of the manufactures in this state, in 1810, was 33,700,000 dollars. Commerce. \u2014 The foreign commerce of this state is not pro portionate to its size ; but there is an extensive inland trade, with the neighbouring regions, and with the Western States. The trade with the Eastern and Southern States is chiefly in way of barter. The amount of exports, in 1822, was 9,048,000 dollars. Banks. \u2014 There are more than 50 banks in this state, a great number of which are in Philadelphia: the remainder are scat tered through the state. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The climate varies, from the cold of New England on the north, to the mildness of Maryland and Virginia on the south. It is generally temperate and salubrious, but liable to sudden changes. Face of the Country. \u2014 Pennsylvania is traversed\" from north to south by the Apalachian chain, which is here divided into several ridges, and gives a mountainous appearance to the state. The southern and western corners are level and undulating. Soil and Productions. \u2014 Much of the soil of the mountainous parts is poor : the valleys, between the ridges and the level country, have a fertile soil, producing grains vegetables and fruits of every description, in abundance. Agriculture is far better in Pennsylvania than in any other state in the Union, and the land is chiefly devoted to tillage. Mountains. \u2014 Pennsylvania is intersected by various moun tains. The principal ridges ofthe Alleghany Mountains in this state are the Kittatinny or Blue Mountains. Rivers.\u2014 The principal rivers are the Delaware, Schuylkill, Susquehannah, Lehigh, Juniata, Alleghany, Monongahela, Ohio and Youghiogeny. ' Mineral Waters.\u2014 Bedford Springs, near the town of Bed ford, and York Springs, 15 miles from Carlisle, are found useful in various complaints, and are much visited. Eleven miles north-"], [73, "OF DELAWARE. 67 s J east of Franklin are celebrated oil springs. The springs rise from a bed on Oil Creek, and by the side of them many oblong pits have been dug, from the bottom of which Seneca oil, or petroleum, oozes, and floats on the surface ofthe water. Fifteen barrels have been taken in one season from a single pit. Minerals. \u2014 Coal is found in Wilkesbarre, and in great abun dance in the country around Pittsburg. Iron ore is distributed in large quantities in many parts ; also marble, and other minerals. Curiosity. \u2014 There is a remarkable grotto, or cave, on the east bank of Swetara River, about two miles above its confluence with the Susquehannah. Its aperture, under a high bank, is from 15 to 20 feet wide, and from 7 to 10 feet in height. You go down by a gradual descent so low that the surface of the river is higher than the bottom of the cave, and in your pro gress pass through a number of passages and apartments of various dimensions, some low and narrow, others very high and spacious, vaulted by magnificent canopies, fretted with a variety of depending petrifactions, some of which, by means of the con stant accretion of petrifying matter, are formed into pillars. These appear as supports of the roof, which is of solid limestone, perhaps 20 feet thick. Thirty years ago there were ten such pillars, each six inches in diameter, and six feet high, all so ranged that the place enclosed resembled a sanctuary in the Roman church. No royal throne ever exhibited more grandeur than this lusus natur\u00e6. The resemblance of several monuments are found indented in the walls on the sides of the cave, which appear like the tombs of departed heroes. Suspended from the roof is \"the bell,\" (which is nothing more than a stone projected in an unusual form,) so called from the sound it occasions when struck, which is similar to that of a bell. Some of the stalactites are of the colour of candy, and others resemble loaf sugar ; but their beauty is much defaced by the smoke of the torches, which are frequently employed in conducting the curi ous traveller through this gloomy recess. The water, which exudes through the roof, runs down the declivity, and is both pleasant and wholesome to drink. There are several holes in the bottom of the cave, descending perpendicularly, perhaps, into an abyss below, which renders it dangerous to walk without a light. At the end of the cave is a pretty brook, which, after a short course, loses itself among the rocks. Bevond this brook is an outlet from the cave by a very narrow aperture. Through this the vapours continually pass outwards, with a very strong current of air, and ascend, resembling, at night, the smoke of a furnace. DELAWARE. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent. \u2014 Delaware is the smallest state, except Rhode Island, in the Union. It is 96 miles long, from north to south. Its"], [74, "68 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW greatest breadth is 36 miles ; its least, 10. Its area is 2060 square miles. It lies between lat. 38\u00b0 30' and 39\u00b0 54', N., and between lon. 74\u00b0 56' and 75\u00b0 40', W. Boundaries. \u2014 Bounded north by Pennsylvania ; east by Dela ware River and Bay, and the Atlantic ; south and west by Ma ryland. Divisions. \u2014 The state is divided into three counties, (Kent, Newcastle and Sussex,) and into 25 townships. Name. \u2014 The name was derived directly from the bay, but originally from Lord De la War, who completed the settlement of Virginia, and died in this bay in 1618. Religion. \u2014 In this state, there is a variety of religious de nominations. Of Presbyterian congregations, there are 24 ; of Episcopalians, 14 ; of Friends, 8 ; of Baptists 7 ; and of Metho dists a considerable number. Besides these, there is a Swedish church half a mile below Wilmington, which is one of the oldest churches in the United States. Government. \u2014 The legislature consists of a senate and house of representatives. The representatives are chosen annually, and by counties. The senators are chosen triennially, and by counties. The governor is chos,en triennially by the freemen, and can hold his office only three years out of every term of six years. Population. \u2014 The population, in 1820, was 72,749. Militia. \u2014 The militia of this state constitute one division, containing three brigades, one in each county. Each brigade comprises three regiments. The whole number of militia in this state is not far from 7000. Revenue. \u2014 The revenue of Delaw7are amounted, in 1815, to thirty-two thousand dollars. Literature. \u2014 There is no college in this state ; but there are academies and high schools in most ofthe principal towns, and the legislature have made provision for the support of schools throughout the state. Towns. \u2014 Dover is the seat of government. It is situated on Jones's Creek, 7 miles above its entrance into Delaware Bay, and 40 south of Wilmington, and contains a handsome state house. Wilmington, situated between the Brandywine and Christiana Creeks, 2 miles west of Delaware River, and 28 south-west of Philadelphia, is much the largest town, and has considerable trade and manufactures. Population, 5,300. New castle, 5 miles south of Wilmington, has some trade ; and at Lewistown, near Cape Henlopen, are large salt works, where salt is manufactured from sea water by the sun. Georgetown, Smyrna, and Milford, are the other most considerable towns. Manufactures. \u2014 On the Brandywine, bordering on Wilming ton, is the finest collection of flour mills in the United States. Cotton and woollen goods, gunpowder, and paper, are also man ufactured extensively in the same neighbourhood. Banks. \u2014 There are a number of banks in this state, several of which are established in Wilmington and Dover."], [75, "69 OF MARYLAND. Commerce. \u2014 The principal article of commerce is flour. Lumber is of the next highest importance, and is procured chiefly from Cypress Swamp. The exports from Delaware, in 1822, were 169,000 dollars, and the amount of shipping, in 1821, was 11,000 tons. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. i Face of the Country. \u2014 In the northern and western parts of Delaware, there is some hilly and broken land ; but the gene ral aspect of the state is that of an extended plain. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The soil, in the northern part, and along Delaware River, is generally a rich clay, well adapted to purposes of agriculture ; in the middle, it is mixed with sand ; in the southern part, the sand generally predominates. Wheat is the staple production of this state. It grows here in such perfection, as not only to be sought by the manufacturers of flour throughout the Union, but also to be distinguished and preferred, for its superior qualities, in foreign markets. The county 'of Sussex, besides producing a considerable quantity of grain, particularly of Indian corn, possesses excellent grazing lands ; and also exports very large quantities of lumber. Rivers. \u2014 The largest rivers, besides the Delaware, which forms apart ofthe boundary, are Brandywine Creek, Christiana Creek, Duck Creek, Mispillion Creek, Indian River, Choptank, and Nanticoke. Swamps. \u2014 More than half of Cypress Swamp lies in Delaware, containing nearlyc50,000 acres. It is a high and level basin, extremely wet, though on the ridge between the Chesapeake and the Atlantic. It contains a very great variety of plants, trees, wild beasts, birds, and reptiles. Mineralogy. \u2014 In the county of Sussex, among the branches of Nanticoke River, large quantities of bog iron are to be found. Before the revolution, this ore was worked to a considerable extent ; it was thought to be of good quality, and peculiarly adapted to the purposes of casting. These works have chiefly fallen to decay. MARYLAND. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent. \u2014 The northern line of the state is 196 miles long* In the broadest part, on the east of the bay, it is 120 miles wide. The number of square miles is about 14,000, of which about one fifth is water. Boundaries. \u2014 Maryland is bounded north by Pennsylvania and Delaware ; east by Delaware and the Atlantic ; south by Virginia and the Chesapeake ; south-west by the Potomac, which separates Maryland from Virginia ; and west by Virginia. Divisions. \u2014 Chesapeake Bay extends up through the state from north to south, dividing it into two parts, The part east"], [76, "GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW 70 of the bay is called the eastern shore, and contains 8 counties ; and the part west is called the western shore, containing 11 counties. Name.\u2014 -Charles I. of England, (in his patent to Lord Balti more, in 1632,) gave the name of Maryland to this territory, in honour of his wife, Henrietta Maria, daughter of Henry the Great of France and Navarre. It was then taken from Virginia. Religion. \u2014 The Roman Catholics were the first settlers ; and there are more of them in Maryland than in all the other states besides. The other principal sects are Episcopalians, Presby terians, Methodists, German Lutherans, and Calvinists. Government. \u2014 The legislature is styled the general assembly, and consists ofthe senate and house of delegates. The senate is chosen by electors, who are elected by the freemen, every fifth yecr, two from a county, and one from each ofthe cities of Annapolis and Baltimore. The delegates are chosen annually, on the first Monday in October. Four are sent by each county, and two from each ofthe two cities. Population. \u2014 The population ofthe state, in 1820, was 407,350, including 107,398 slaves. Militia. \u2014 The militia of this state amounted, in 1813, to 32,183, consisting of able bodied men, between 18 and 45, and organized in the manner they are in the other states. Revenue. \u2014 The revenue of this state, in 1815, amounted to 4,151,000; it is raised chiefly from taxes on real and personal property. Character. \u2014 The inhabitants, except in the populous towns, live on their plantations. Their manners are as polished as those of the country gentlemen in England ; their minds are well informed, and their intercourse free and social; their sons generally receive a liberal education, and many of them engage in the study of law, without any intention of pursuing it as a profession. Literature. \u2014 In Baltimore is an institution, styled the Univer sity of Maryland. The medical department is one of the most flourishing medical schools in the United States. There are two other seminaries in the city, styled St. Mary's College and Baltimore College. There are 17 academies, which are supported, in part, by the state. Towns. \u2014 Annapolis is the seat of government. It is situated on the Severn, 2 miles above its entrance into the Chesapeake, 28 miles south-south-east of Baltimore, and contains a handsome state-house, and 2,-'->00 inhabitants. Baltimore is much the largest town in the state, and is third in size in the Union. It is pleasantly situated on the Patapsco, 14 miles above its entrance into the Chesapeake, and is a pjace of great commerce. The city is regularly laid out, the houses mostly of brick, and several of its public edifices are magnifi cent. The Washington monument is a superb structure of stone, 163 feet high. Population, 62,100. Fredericktown, situated in the interior, in a fertile tract of"], [77, "71 OF MARYLAND. country, 45 miles west of Baltimore, is a pleasant and handsome town, and has an extensive inland trade. Population, 3600. Hagerstown, 26 miles north-west of Fredericktown, situated in a fertile country, is a flourishing town. Among the other considerable towns are Cumberland, on the Potomac, Elkton, Chestertown, Snowhill and Cambridge, on the eastern shore. Manufactures. \u2014 Wheat is manufactured into flour in Fred erick county to a great extent. The value of the manufactures of this state, in 1810, was 11,408,794 dollars. Commerce. \u2014 Maryland holds a high rank as a commercial state. The most important article of export is flour ; next to this, tobacco. The exports from Maryland, in 1822, amounted to 4,537,000 dollars. The aggregate tonnage, in 1821, was 127,000 tons. Banks. \u2014 There are 24 banks in this state, including branches, 10 of which are at Baltimore ; the rest in 14 different towns in other parts of the state. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Face of the Country. \u2014 The eastern shore is low, level and sandy ; on the western shore, below the falls of the rivers, it is similar. Beyond the falls, it becomes variegated and hilly ; and the western part is mountainous. Soil! and Productions. \u2014 A part of the eastern shore, and the tracts lying on the bay, are sandy, but the soil is generally rich, and produces the finest wheat and tobacco. The staple of Maryland is tobacco, a plant to which the far mers of the states farther north are almost strangers, and which is cultivated by the labour of slaves. The negroes work in sets. The seed is sown in beds of fine mould, and transplanted in the beginning of May. The plants are set at the distance of three or four feet from each other, and are tilled, and kept continually free from weeds. When as many leaves have shot out as the soil will nourish to advantage, the top of the plant is broken off, to prevent its growing higher. It is carefully kept clear of worms, and the suckers, which put up between the leaves, are taken off at proper times, till the p)ant arrives at perfection, which is in August. When the leaves turn of a brownish colour, and begin to\u00b0be spotted, the plant is cut down, and hung up to dry, after having sweated in heaps over night. When it can be handled without crumbling, the leaves are stripped from the stalk, tied in bundles, and packed for exportation in hogsheads containing 800 or 900 pounds. No suckers or ground leaves are allowed to be merchantable. About 6000 plants yield 1000 pounds of tobacco. Rivers.\u2014 The Potomac forms the boundary on the south-west. The other principal rivers \u25a0 are the Susquehannah, Patapsco, Patuxent, Elk, Sassafras, Chester, Choptank, Nanticoke and Pocomoke. Bays.\u2014 Nearly two thirds of the length of Chesapeake Bay"], [78, "72 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW lies in Maryland. Senipuxen Bay is only a channel between the eastern coast and a succession of sand and islands. Swamp. \u2014 A part of Cypress Swamp, partly in Delaware, has already been mentioned as lying in Maryland. Mountains. \u2014 The various ridges of the Alleghany Mountains cross the western and narrow parts of this state. The most eastern ridge is the South Mountain, and then the Blue Ridge ; between which and the Alleghany range are various ridges of mountains, which run but a short distance in Maryland. Mineralogy. \u2014 Iron ore, of an excellent quality, is found in plenty in many parts of the state. Two beds of coal have been opened within a mile of the city of Baltimore. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. Extent and Situation. \u2014 This district is a square, with a side of 10 miles, and of course contains 100 square miles, or 64,000 acres. It lies on both sides of the Potomac, and 120 miles from its mouth, embracing a section of that river, extending from the southern part of Alexandria, to a point 5 miles above George town, including a part of one of the Potomac canals. It is sit uated between lat. 38\u00b0 48' and 38\u00b0 59' N. ; and the capital is in about 77\u00b0 00' 22\" W. lon. from London. Boundaries. \u2014 On the south-east, north-east, and in part on the north-west, it is bounded by Maryland ; on all other sides, by Virginia. Divisions. \u2014 It is divided into the counties of Alexandria and Washington. Religion.\u2014 Presbyterians and Episcopalians are the two pre vailing denominations in the district. There are also here Roman Catholics, Methodists and Baptists, all of whom have places for public worship. Government. \u2014 This district is exclusively under the authority of congress. Population. \u2014 The population of the district, in 1820, was 33,039, of whom 6377 were slaves, and 4048 free persons of colour. Towns. \u2014 Washington, the metropolis of the United States, is situated in the District of Columbia, on the Maryland side of the Pt>tomac,295 miles, by the course ofthe river and bay, from the Atlantic. It contains upwards of 13,000 inhabitants. The site consists of a point of land between the Eastern Branch and the Potomac, and the ground, as laid out, extends two or three miles up both of these 'rivers. It is separated from Georgetown by Rock Creek, over which are two bridges, and there is a bridge over the Potomac, more than a mile in length, leading to Alexandria. The natural situation of Washington is pleasant and salubrious, and it is laid out on a plan, which, when com pleted, will render it one ofthe most handsome and commodious cities in the world. It is divided into squares by spacious"], [79, "OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 73 streets or avenues, from 130 to 160 feet wide, running north and south, and intersected by others at right angles ; these are crossed transversely by 15 other spacious streets. But a small part of the plan is yet completed. The buildings, which cover a small portion of the site as laid out, stand in 4 or 5 separate divisions, and Washington, at present, exhibits the appearance, not of & regular city, but of a collection of villages, in which the splendid public edifices appear of a disproportionate grandeur. Pennsylvania Avenue is the principal street, extending a mile and a half, between the capitol and the president's house and the public offices. The principal public buildings and institu tions are, the capitol and the president's house, of stone ; 4 spacious brick edifices for the state, treasury, war and navy de partments ; the general post office, city hall, Columbian College, navy yard, and 14 houses of public worship. The president's house is situated on a gentle eminence, a mile and a half west of the capitol. It is built of white freestone, and covered with marble. It is a very elegant edifice, 176 feet by 85, of 2 stories, with a suitable basement story. Alexandria, pleasantly situated on the south bank of the Po tomac, 6 miles south of Washington, has a flourishing trade, chiefly in flour. Georgetown, on the Potomac, separated from Washington by Rock Creek, 3 miles west of the capitol, is a handsome town, and has considerable trade. THE CAPITOL. The'capitol, at Washington, is finely situated on an eminence at tlie east end of Pennsylvania Avenue, commanding a beautiful prospect ofthe Potomac, of every part of the city, and a wide extent ofthe surrounding country. It is by far the most mag nificent edifice in the United States, and the only one that can be compared in grandeur to the most splendid public buildings in Europe. It is built of white freestone, and the whole cost of it, when completed, is estimated at 3,000,000 dollars. The prin cipal building is 340 feet by 120 ; with two projections, one 170 by 65 ; the other, 170 by 83. ' It is surrounded by an elegant iron paling, which encloses 20 acres of ground, planted with various kinds of trees and shrubs. The north wing^s occupied by the senate, the south by the house of representatives. There are also rooms for the supreme court of the United States, the national library, and other purposes. The senate and represen tative halls are finished in a style of great elegance and splen dour. The one belonging to the house of representatives has been pronounced by an intelligent English traveller to be \" the most beautiful hall 'he ever saw.\" It is of a semi-circular form, surrounded by 22 massy pillars or columns, and 4 pilasters of Breccia, or Potomac marble, as it is called, which stand on an elevated base of freestone. The capitals of these pillars are formed of Carrara marble, and are very beautiful ; and there is 7"], [80, "74 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW supported by them a large and magnificent dome, in the centre of which is placed an ornamental cupola, which admits the light into the hall from above. In front of the speaker's chair, and over the entrance into the chamber, stands an allegorical figure, formed of Italian marble, representing History in the act of re cording the proceedings ofthe nation. She stands on a winged car, which seems to roll over a section of the terrestrial globe, exhibiting, in bass-relief, the signs of the zodiac. The wheel of the car is intended as the face of a clock, which is to be placed behind, and the front contains, in bass-relief, a figure of Fame, and a profile bust of Washington. Above tbe speaker's chair is a colossal figure of Liberty, in plaster, pointing to the hall below, and supported on the right by an American eagle, and on the left by the Roman fasces, which are partially envel oped in the folds of a serpent. Immediately under this figure, on the frieze, is carved, in high relief, another eagle in the attitude of flying. Literature. \u2014 There is a Catholic college in Georgetown, which has respectable endowments. Columbian College, in Washington, is very pleasantly situated on College Hill, a mile north of the president's house. The plan embraces, in connexion with the college, a preparatory school, a theological and a medical department. Rivers. \u2014 The Potomac intersects this district, and is naviga ble close to the bank, for large ships, half a mile above Green leaf's Point, and in the channel some distance farther. The Eastern Branch, as it is called, rises in Maryland, and flows about 20 miles. It is chiefly a bay of the Potomac, and is navi gable 4 miles along the bank for the largest ships. Rock Creek runs southerly about 16 miles. Tiber, or Goose Creek, is a small stream, running through the city. Its source being 236 feet above the level ofthe Potomac, it can be made the reservoir of aqueducts for any part of the city. Four Mile Run falls into the Potomac from the Virginia side, opposite the Eastern Branch. Canals and Bridges. \u2014 A canal has been opened, connecting the Tiber with the Eastern Branch ; the tide flows into it 5 or 6 inches deep. Besides this is a canal of much importance to the city, which passes the Little Falls, above Georgetown, through which is brought the greater part of the flour used in the district, and exported from it, and also marble columns for the city edifices. Two bridges are built over Rock Creek, which divides the city from Georgetown. The bridge near the mouth of the creek his three arches, is about 135 feet in length, and 36 wide. The other, 650 yards above, is supported by piles, and is about 280 feet long, and 18 wide. A bridge over the Potomac, within this district, was built in 1809, on piles, one mile long, and another over the Eastern Branch."], [81, "OF VIRGINIA. 75 VIRGINIA. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent\u2014 This state lies between lat. 36\u00b0 30' and 40\u00b0 43' N., and between ton. 75\u00b0 25' and 83\u00b0 40' W. Its length, on the southern line of the state, is 440 miles.

Boundaries. \u2014 Bounded north by Pennsylvania and Maryland ; east by Maryland and the Atlantic ; south by North Carolina and Tennessee ; west by the Cumberland Mountains and Big Sandy River, which divide it from Kentucky and Tennessee ; and north-west by Ohio River, which divides it from Ohio. Divisions. \u2014 The state is divided into 103 counties. Name. \u2014 Queen Elizabeth, in 1584, gave the name of Virginia to a much larger tract than is now included in its limits ; as a memorial that its discovery was made under a virgin queen. Religion. \u2014 Virginia is deficient in churches, but religion is making progress. The most considerable sects are the Baptists and Methodists. The Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Friends, are next in numbers. Government. \u2014 The legislature is called the general assembly, and is composed of a senate and house of representatives. The senate consists of 24 members, who are chosen for four years by districts. One fourth of the senate goes out yearly. The repre sentatives are chosen annually, two from each county, and one from several cities and boroughs each. The governor is chosen annually by joint ballot of both houses, and can hold the office but 3 years out of 7. Population. \u2014 The population of the state, in 1790, was 747,610, and in 1820, 1,065,366, the latter number including 425,153 slaves. Militia. \u2014 The number of the mUitia, in 1817, was 85,758. It is divided into four grand divisions, each of which is com manded by a major-general. The governor is head ofthe mili tary as well as the civil power. Revenue. \u2014 The revenue amounts commonly to about 600,000 dollars, and is raised principally by a tax on land and slaves. Character. \u2014 The Virginians are firm republicans, polite, frank, hospitable, generous, and high-spirited. The general character of the people west of the Blue Ridge is that of industry, temper ance and economy. The religious and moral state ofthe great body ofthe inhabitants is deplorable. This state has produced some' of the most distinguished char acters in American history, Four of the presidents of the United States have been Virginians. Literature.\u2014 The University of Virginia is established at Charlottesville. The buildings are on a large scale, and were erected at great expense. There are, besides, 3 colleges, \u2014 Wil liam and Mary's College, at Williamsburg ; Washington Col-"], [82, "76 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW lege, at Lexington; and Hampden Sidney College, in Prince Edward county, 85- miles south-west of Richmond. Academies have been established in various places. The state has a fund of upwards of 1,100,000 dollars, the interest of which is appropriated to the use of schools and for literary purposes. Towns. \u2014 Richmond is the largest town, and the seat of govern ment. It is beautifully situated at the Falls of James River, about 150 miles from its mouth. It contains a capitol, or state house, and various other public buildings, and has an extensive trade. Norfolk, on Elizabeth River, 8 miles above its entrance into Hampton Roads, has a good harbour, and more foreign com merce than any other town in the> state. Petersburg, on the Appomattox, 24 miles south by east of Richmond, has consider able trade in tobacco and flour. Lynchburg, on James River, near the head of boat navigation, 120 miles west of Richmond, is a thriving town, and has a flourishing trade. Fredericksburg, on the Rappahannock, near the head of navigation, is a place of considerable trade. Williamsburg, 55 miles east by south of Richmond, was formerly the seat of government. Winchester, 70 miles west-north-west of Washington city, is a pleasant and flourishing inland town. It has a healthy situation, with several mineral springs in its vicinity, and is a place of considerable re sort in the hot season. Yorktown, on York River, 29 miles north-west of Norfolk, has a good harbour, and is famous for the surrender ofthe British army, under Lord Cornwallis, in 1781. Mount Vernon, the celebrated seat of General Washington, is pleasantly situated on the Potomac, 9 miles below Alexandria. Monticello, the seat of Mr. Jefferson, is 2 miles from Char lottesville. \u25a0 Manufactures. \u2014 The manufactures of this state are chiefly domestic, except those of iron, lead, and small arms, which are on a considerable scale. The amount of manufactures, in 1810, was 15,300,000 dollars. Commerce. \u2014 Estimating by the amount of its exports in 182?, Virginia holds only the eighth rank among the commercial states. The exports consist chiefly of tobacco, flour, Indian corn, pork, lumber, coals. The amount of exports at the above date was 3,217,000 dollars. Banks. \u2014 There are 17 banks in this state, which are distrib uted among the principal towns. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The climate varies very much ; it is hot, moist, and unhealthy in the lower alluvial country, and cool and salubrious among the mountains. Face ofthe Country. \u2014 The Apalachian chain covers the whole middle section with its ridges, and gives it a rugged surface. The country east of these descends gradually to the flat and sandy alluvion ofthe coast. The district west of the mountains is hilly. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The soil varies very much ; sandy and"], [83, "OF VIRGINIA. 77 sterile on the coast -, extremely fertile on the banks of rivers ; and productive in the valleys of the Alleghanies. This state has the most valuable productions of temperate regions; and the southern part has some belonging to the warm regions. The upper country raises excellent wheat; tobacco is extensively cultivated between tide-water and the mountains ; and rice, with some cotton, grows near the coast. Rivers. \u2014 The Ohio is the north-west boundary for many mfles ; and the Potomac, one of the largest rivers that flows into the Atlantic, the north-east, through its whole length. James River runs wholly in this state ; the Roanoke, partly in Virginia, and partly in North Carolina ; the Monongahela and Great Kenhawa, chiefly in Virginia. The other principal rivers are the Rappa hannock, Shenandoah, York, Appomattox, Elizabeth and Sandy. Mountains. \u2014 The mountains of this state are all in ridges, run ning, in a north-east direction. The Blue Ridge extends from south-west to north-east through the central part of the state. West of this are other ranges of the Alleghany Mountains, as North Mountain, Laurel Mountain, and Jackson's Mountain. The Cumberland Mountains are in the south-western part of the state. The Peaks of Otter, summits ofthe Blue Ridge, are ac counted the most elevated mountains in Virginia. Minerals. \u2014 Virginia is rich in iron, coal, and other minerals of value. Mineral Waters. \u2014 There are several mineral springs of some celebrity. Berkeley Springs, near the Potomac, 35 miles north oy west of Winchester, and Sweet Spring, about 70 miles west ot\" Lexington, are places of much resort. There are two springs near Bath, between Jackson's River and Mountain. The Warm Spring issues with a bpld stream, sufficient to turn a mill, and to keep the water of its basin, which is 30 feet in diameter, at the temperature of 96\u00b0. The Hot Spring, 6 miles from the Warm, is much smaller. Swamp. \u2014 A considerable part of Dismal Swamp is in this state. Capes. \u2014 Cape Charles and Cape Henry, sometimes called the Capes of Virginia. NATURAL CURIOSITIES. Natural Bridge. \u2014 This wonderful bridge is by some esteem ed, next to the cataract of Niagara, the greatest natural curiosi ty in the United States. The following description of it is by Mr. Jefferson : \u2014 \" The Natural Bridge, the most sublime of nature's works, is on the ascent of a hill, which seems to have been cloven through its length by some great convulsion. The fissure, just at the bridge, is, by some admeasurements, 270 feet deep, Dy others, only 205. It is about 45 feet wide at the bottom, and 90 feet at the top ; this of course determines the length of the bridge, and its height from the water. Its breadth in the middle is about 60 feet, but more at the ends, and the thickness of the mass 7*"], [84, "78 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW at the summit of the arch, about 40 feet. A part of this thick ness is constituted by a coat of earth, which gives growth to many large trees. The residue, with the hill on both sides, is one solid rock of limestone. \" The arch approaches the semi-elliptical form, but the larger axis of the ellipsis, which would be the chord of the arch, is many times larger than the transverse.' Though the. sides of this bridge are provided, in some parts, with a parapet of fixed rocks, yet few men have resolution to walk to them, and look over into the abyss. You involuntarily fall on your hands and feet, creep to the parapet, and peep over it. Looking down from this height about a minute, gave me a violent headache. \"The fissure continuing narrow, deep, and straight, for a con siderable distance' above and below the bridge, opens a short but very pleasing view of the North Mountain on one side, and the Blue Ridge on the other, at the distance, each of them, of about 5 miles. This bridge is in the county of Rockbridge, to which it has given name, and affords a public and commodious passage over a valley, which cannot be crossed elsewhere for a con siderable distance. The stream passing under it is called Ce dar Creek. It is a water of James River, and sufficient in the driest seasons to turn a grist mill, though its fountain is not more than two miles above.\" The passage of the Potomac, immediately aster its junction with the Shenandoah, through the Blue Ridge, at Harper's Ferry, is a singular and highly interesting spectacle. The river here descends 15 feet, and rolls between its walls of rock with the wildness and rapidity of a cataract. The mountains on each side are perpendicular, and appear to have been separated by some great convulsion of nature. Wier's Cave. \u2014 In the limestone country of Virginia, there are several caves of considerable extent. The most remarkable one is Wier's Cave, which is on the north side of the Blue Fridge, and on the south fork ofthe Shenandoah. It is in a hill, which is about 200 feet in perpendicular height, and so steep that you may pitch a biscuit from its summit into the river which washes its base. It was discovered in 1814. Its entrance is only about 100 yards from that of Madison's Cave, another cele brated cavern, which, though it has been much longer known, is greatly inferior to Wier's Cave. The following is an account of a visit to this extraordinary place: \u2014 \"There were three of U3, besides our guide, with lighted torches, and our loins girded, now ready to descend into the cave. We took our lights in our left hands, and entered. The mouth was so small that we could descend only by creeping one after another. A descent of almost 20 yards brought us into the first room. The cave was cold, dark and silent. In this manner we proceeded, now descending 30 or 40 feet, now as cending as -high, now creeping on our hands and knees, and now walking in large rooms, the habitations of solitude. The mountain seems to be composed almost wholly of limestone,"], [85, "79 OF VIRGINIA. and by this means the cave is lined throughout with the most beautiful incrustations and stalactites of carbonated lime, which are formed by the continual dripping of water. These stalac tites are of various and elegant shapes and colours, often bear ing a striking resemblance to animated nature. At one place we saw over our heads what appeared to be a water fall of the most delightful kind, descending 12 or 15 feet. Nor could the imagination be easily persuaded that it was not in reality a water fall. You could see the water dashing and boiling down, with its white spray and foam; but it was all solid, carbonated lime stone. Thus we passed on in this world of solitude ; now stop ping to admire the beauties of a single stalactite ; now wonder ing at the magnificence of a large room ; now creeping through narrow passages, hardly wide enough to admit the body of a man ; and now walking in superb galleries, until we came to the largest room, called Washington hall. This is certainly the most elegant room I ever saw. It is about 270 feet in length, about 35 in width, and between 30 and 40 feet high. Tlie roof and sides are beautifully adorned by the tinsels which nature has bestowed in the greatest profusion, and which sparkle like the diamond, while surveyed by the light of torches. The floor is smooth, flat and solid. I was foremost of our little party in entering this room, and was not a little startled on approach ing the centre, and by my small light seeing a figure as it were rising up before me, out of solid rock. It was not far from 7 feet high, and corresponding in every respect to the common idea of a ghost. It was very white, and resembled a tall man clothed in a shroud. I went up to it sideways, though I could not really expect to meet a ghost in a place like this. On examination, I found it was a very beautiful piece of the carbonate of lime, very transparent, and very much in the shape of a man. This is called Washington's statue. In one room we found an excel lent spring of water, which boiled up, slaked our thirst, sunk ao-ain into the mountain, and was seen no more. In another room was a noble pillar, called the tower of Babel. It is com posed entirely of stalactites of lime, or, as its appearance would seem to suggest, of petrified water. It is about 30 feet in diam eter, and a little more than 96 in circumference, and about 30 high. It 'would appear as if there were many millions of stalac tites in this one pillar.\" Falling Spring, about 50 miles west by north of Lexington, has a cataract of 200 feet perpendicular. Near the Great Kenhawa there is a small cavity in the earth, from which issues a stream of air, which, on applying a torch, takes fire, and sometimes burns several days. Near Panther Gap is Blowing Cave, from which a strong current of air continually issues. Near the Ohio, 12 miles below Wheeling, is a vast mound, 300 feet in diameter at the base, and 90 high, containing thou- sands of human skeletons."], [86, "80 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW NORTH CAROLINA.

Manufactures. \u2014 The manufactures of this state, are chiefly do mestic. The amount of manufactures, in 1810, was $6,700,000. Commerce. \u2014 Its commerce is limited for want of good har bours; and there is no considerable seaport. The amount of exports from this state, in 1821, was \u00a7586,000. The aggregate tonnage of this state, for the year 1821, was 33,000. Banks. \u2014 There are more than 10 banks in this state, which are distributed in the principal towns. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The climate is unhealthy in the low country ; but very agreerable in the elevated tracts. June is the most healthy month ; often May and July may be called healthy. Summers dry and cool are the most salubrious. The hottest weather is in July. Autumn is very pleasant, both in regard to the tem perature anil serenity of the weather, and the richness and va riety of the vegetable productions, which the season affords. The winters ave so mild in some years, that autumn may be said to continue till spring. Wheat harvest is in the beginning of June, and that of Indian corn early in September. Face of the Country. \u2014 North Carolina is divided into the low and sandy alluvion on the coast, the middle country on the Alleghanies, and the high countries among these mountains. Its coast is flat, and lined with sand-bars and islands. It is furnished with numerous sounds and inlets, but has no good harbours. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The soil varies with the geology, but is generally unproductive, except in the valleys of the streams, and among the mountains. It produces the crops both of the Northern and Southern States. The potatoe is indigenous in this state, and is supposed to have been conveyed from hence to Ireland in 1587 or 1588. Mountains. \u2014 The Alleghany Ridge crosses the western part of this state, and the Blue Ridge lies farther east. Rivers. \u2014 The principal rivers are the Roanoke, Chowan, Neuse, Pamlico or Tar, Cape Fear, Yadkin and Catawba. Sounds. \u2014 Albemarle, Pamlico and Core Sounds, all commu nicate with each other. The inlets are Currituck, Roanoke, Grant and Ocracoke ; the last only is navigable. Capes. \u2014 Cape Hatteras is the most dangerous cape on the American coast. The shoals are extensive, and the weather frequently tempestuous. Cape Lookout and Cape Fear are also formidable to seamen."], [88, "82 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW Swamps.\u2014 Great Dismal Swamp lies partly in this state, and partly in Virginia. It is 30 miles long, and 10 broad, and is a marshy tract, covered with trees and brushwood, in many parts so thick as to be impenetrable. Little Dismal Swamp is be tvyeen Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds. Mineralogy. \u2014 A gold mine has been discovered in Cabarras county, in this state, which had, in 1805, furnished the mint of the United States with virgin gold, which has produced 11,000 dollars, gold coin ; more has been found, but the extent of the mine has not yet been discovered. Gold has be'en discovered in other creeks in the same neighbourhood. There is a long ridge of limestone, which, extending in a south-westerly direction, crosses the whole state of North Carolina. Natural Curiosities. \u2014 Ararat or Pilot Mountain, is regarded as a great curiosity. It rises in the form of a pyramid, nearly a mile high. On the area at the top, which contains only about an acre, a stupendous rock rises to the height of 300 feet, and terminates with a flat surface at the top, which affords an ex tensive and delightful prospect. In the vicinity of Salisbury, there is a remarkable stone wall, the top of which approaches within one foot of the surface of the ground. It is laid in cement, plastered on both sides, 22 inches thick, and 12 or 13 feet high. The length of what has been discovered is 300 feet. SOUTH CAROLINA. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent\u2014 This state lies between lat. 32\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 8' N\u201e and between lon. 78\" 24' and 83\u00b0 30' W. The greatest length of the state, from the mouth of the Santee to the north-west angle, is upwards of 340 miles. The breadth on the 'coast is 170 miles, but it is generally much less ; and, at the farther extrem ity, terminates in a point. Boundaries. \u2014 On the north and north-east, by North Caro lina; on the east, by the Atlantic ; and on the south-west and west, by the Savannah and Tugulo Rivers, which separate it from Georgia. Divisions; \u2014 This state is divided into 28 districts. Name. \u2014 This was a part of the Florida of the early Spanish and French, and of the Virginia and South Virginia, of the early English voyagers. With North Carolina and Georgia, it received the name of Carolana in 1630, and that of Carolina in 1663. The name of South Carolina was given it when it was separated from North Carolina, in 1729. Population. \u2014 The population of South Carolina, in 1790, was 240,073, including 107,094 slaves. In 1820, it was 502,741, including 258,475 slaves ; so that the number ofthe latter has increased faster than that of the freemen,"], [89, "OF SOUTH CAROLINA. 83 Religion. \u2014 The Methodists are the most numerous sect. Next to these are the Baptists, Presbyterians of different de scriptions, Episcopalians and Congregationalists. Besides the above, there are a few German and French Protestants, Quakers, Roman Catholics and Jews. The greater part of these de nominations reside in the city of Charleston. Government \u2014 The legislature consists of a senate and house of representatives. The senate is composed of 43 members, chosen every four years, by districts. The house of representa tives consists of 124 members, chosen every two years by dis tricts. The governor is chosen every two years, by a joint bal lot of both houses. He can hold the office only two years in six. Militia. \u2014 The militia of this state is respectable. It amounts to 33,729 men, divided into 5 grand divisions, each commanded by a major-general. Revenue. \u2014 The revenue of this state, in 1815, was 1,429,000 dollars. The taxes are on land and negroes. Character.\u2014 The Carolinians, says Dr. Ramsay, combine the love of liberty, hospitality, charity, and a sense of honour, with dissipation, indolence, and a disposition to contract debts. Hunting and dancing are favourite diversions, and music is cul tivated with much diligence and success. The planters, who form the leading class, and have large incomes, live at their ease, are high-minded, and possess much of that dignity of character, which belongs to our independent country gentlemen. The farmers, who have few or no slaves, are active, industrious, and more simple in their manners. The women are generally well educated, and many of them possess refined manners and cultivated minds. Their natural vivacity is tempered by sweet ness of disposition and discretion. They are affectionate wives, daughters, and mothers: they enjoy prosperity without ostenta tion, and bear adversity with patience and dignity. \" Indolence, ignorance and dissipation,\" in the opinion of Mr. Hall, \"are leading traits in the character of the planters of the Southern States.\" The manners of the lower classes are depraved and brutal ; those of the upper, corrupted by power, are frequently arrogant and assuming. Unused to restraint or contradiction of any kind, they are necessarily quarrelsome ; and in their quarrels the native ferocity of their hearts breaks out. Duelling is not only in general vogue and fashion, but is practised with circumstances of peculiar vindictiveness. \"It is usual, when two persons have agreed to fight, for each to go out regularly, and practise at a mark, in presence of their friends, during the interval which precedes their meeting : one ofthe parties, there fore, commonly falls.\" These observations will apply to other Southern States. Literature. \u2014 In 1785, three colleges were constituted in this state, on the same day \u2014 one at Charleston, one at Winnsborough, and the other at Cambridge ; but they are colleges in name only, in truth only grammar schools. In 1795, a charter was granted for a college at Beaufort."], [90, "84 GEOGRAPHICAL' VIEW South Carolina College, at Columbia, a well endowed and re spectable institution, is liberally patronised by the state. Academies have been established in various places. The state has appropriated 30,000 dollars annually for the support of free schools. Towns.\u2014 Charleston is much the largest town, and the princi pal emporium, not only of South Carolina, but also of a consid erable part of North Carolina. It is situated on a tongue of land, formed by the confluence of Cooper and Ashley Rivers, 7 miles from the ocean. It is regularly laid out, well built, and contains various public buildings, and is a place of much wealth and commerce. The houses are mostly of brick, many of them elegant, and furnished with piazzas. Population, 24,800. Columbia is the seat of government. It is pleasantly situated on the Congaree, 120 miles north-north-west of Charleston. It is a flourishing town, regularly laid out, and handsomely built, and contains a stale-house, and a number of other elegant pub lic edifices. Population, 3,000. Georgetown, on Winyaw Bay, 12 miles from the sea, 60 north north-east of Charleston, has considerable trade. Population, 2,000. Camden is situated at the head of boat navigation, on the Wateree, 25 miles north-east of Columbia ; Beaufort, on an island, 72 miles south-west of Charleston. Banks. \u2014 There are 8 banks in this state ; 6 at Charleston, 1 at Columbia, 1 at Georgetown. Manufactures.\u2014 Domestic manufactures, in the upper dis tricts, are carried on to an extent which goes far to supply the wants of families, but none are made for exportation, articles of iron excepted. The amount of manufactures in this state, in 1810, was 3,623,595. Commerce.1 \u2014 The exports of South Carolina exceed those of any one of the Southern States, except Louisiana, which is properly the outlet of the whole western country. Cotton and rice are the leading articles, after which may be classed timber, pitch, tar, turpentine, beef, pork, indigo, and tobacco. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The climate of this state is warmer than that of North Carolina ; but the degree of heat in Charleston is con siderably less than in the interior western country. April, May, and June, are commonly the healthiest months ; August and September the most unhealthy. The hottest day of the year is sometimes as early as June, sometimes as late as September, but most frequently in July or August. The soil is seldom bound with frost, and this does not often extend into the ground more than two inches. Sharp cold weather seldom commences before December, though there are several cold days in No vember. .Face of the Country. \u2014 This state is sometimes divided, as to its surface, into the lower and upper country. The upper coun-"], [91, "85 OF SOUTH CAROLINA. try includes all the land above the falls of the rivers, and the lower comprehends all the country between this and the sea coast. This country produces extensive forests of pitch-pine, which are called pine baiTens. Extensive marshes and swamps are also sound in this tract. The western part of the state is mountainous. Seit and Productions. \u2014 The rivers are bordered with marshes, in which are produced large crops of rice. To the distance of 100 miles from the sea, the country is low, flat, and sandy. Above this, and reaching to the foot of the mountains, is a fer tile country, beautifully diversified with hill and dale, and richly wooded. In addition to many of the fruits of the Northern States, South Carolina produces oranges, limes, lemons, figs, and pomegranates. The low country is universally occupied by planters, who cultivate the ground by slaves ; in the upper coun try the population consists chiefly of farmers, who work with their own hands. Cotton, the great staple of the state, is of three varieties. The black seed cotton is grown on the sea islands, and in the low country ; it produces a fine, white fleece, of a silky appearance, very strong, and of a long, good staple. Green seed, or upland cotton, chiefly cultivated in the middle and upper country, produces a white fleece, good, but of shorter staple, and inferior to the other. It adheres so closely to the seed, that, till the invention ofthe cotton gin by Mr. Whitney, it was not worth cleaning. That invention has been of incalcula ble benefit to the Southern States. The Nankeen cotton, raised chiefly in the middle and upper country, for family use, retains the Nankeen colour as long as it is worn. The cultivation of rice is necessarily limited to lands that admit of irrigation \u2014 to swamps on bays, creeks and rivers overflowed by the tide, and to inland swamps, with reservoirs of water. Inland plantations yield from 600 to 1500 pounds of clean rice per acre ; tide plantations, from 1200 to 1500, and the best as high as 2400 per acre. Rice is sown in the tide lands about the 20th of March, and in the inland swamps about the second week in April. The land is previously turned up with the plough or hoe, and then drilled by the same instruments into trenches. In these the rice is sown, from one to two bushels per acre. The planters then flow the fields with water, keeping it on from two to four days. This kills the worms, and starts the grain, which appears five or six days afterwards. It is commonly hoed three times during its growth, and in the second hoeing the grass is picked up by the hand from the trenches, and the rice is then overflowed from ten to twenty days. As the water is gradually drawn off, the plants branch, and on the number of branches depends the size ofthe crop, each branch producing one ear of from 100 to \u2022300 grains. Three months after sowing, it begins to joint, blossom, and form the ear. It is then overflowed till harvest, which commences in the end of August, near the sea, and in September is general through the state. The rice grounds, thus alternately wet and dry, infect the air with noxious exhala- 8"], [92, "86 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW tions, and spread bilious and intermitting fevers among the ne groes who labour them, and the white settlers who live in their vicinity. A single plantation has often rendered a considerable town unhealthy. Rice was introduced into Carolina from Mad agascar only in 1693. Mountains. \u2014 The Alleghany Mountains extend through the western part of this state. The principal summit in South Caro Una is Table Mountain, which has been estimated at about 4,000 feet in height. On one side of it is a tremendous precipice, nearly perpendicular, styled the Lover's Leap, which is regard ed as an interesting curiosity. Rivers. \u2014 The Savannah separates this state from Georgia. The Santee is the largest river in South Carolina. It is formed by the Congaree and Wateree. Steamboats go up to Columbia on the Congaree, and boats to Camden on the Wateree. The Pedee is navigable for boats about 200 miles. Some of the other rivers are the Waccamaw, Cooper, Ashley, Edisto, and Combahee. Canal. \u2014 A canal, 22 miles long, connects Coop'er River with the Santee. Mineralogy. \u2014 Iron ore of an excellent quality abounds in tha upper country, particularly in the districts of Pendleton and Greenville. THE MAGNOLIA. The magnolia grandiflora is the glory of the southern forest, and produces a larger flower than any other tree that is known. It is found in great perfection in Florida, and in several of the Southern States. It is a noble evergreen tree, and an uncom monly striking object, rising with an erect trunk to the height of 100 feet, and forming towards the head a perfect cone, having its dark-green foliage silvered over with milk-white flowers, fre quently 8 or 9 inches in diameter. The leaves are partly of an oval form, of a deep green, shining and beautiful. The magno lia blossoms in July. The flowers are on the extremities of the branches, perfectly white, and expanded like a full blown rose. GEORGIA. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent. \u2014 This state lies between lat. 30\u00b0 42' and 35\u00b0 N., and between lon. 80\u00b0 20' and 86\u00b0 W. Its length is 270 miles. Its breadth at Savannah is 250 ; on the southern boundary, 170, and om the northern, 120.

Divisions. \u2014 That part of the state which is settled is divided into 4 districts, and 38 counties. Names. \u2014 The French and Spaniards early gave the name of Florida to a large undefined tract of country, reaching north ward from the Gulf of Mexico. The English, at the same time, gave it the name of Virginia and South Virginia. The name of Carolana was given, in 1630, to all the country south of lat. 16\u00b0, and that of Carolina to the country between 26\u00b0 and 31\u00b0 north, in 1663. This state was included under each of these territories. Its present name was given to it in 1732, in honour of George II. Religion. \u2014 The inhabitants of this state, who profess the Christian religion, are of the Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Baptist and Methodist denominations. The two latter are much the most numerous. Population. \u2014 The population of Georgia, in 1790, was 82,548, and in 1820, it had increased to 340,989, of whom 149,656 were slaves. Government. \u2014 The legislature is styled the general assembly, and consists of a senate and a house of representatives. The senate are chosen annually by counties, one from each. The representatives are chosen annuallyby counties, each sending at least one, and none more than four. The governor is chosen for two years, by the general assembly. Indians. \u2014 The Creek Indians inhabit the western and south western parts of the state ; and the north-western part is in cluded in the Cherokee country. Militia. \u2014 There were, in 1817, 27,484 men on the militia rolls in this state, in general badly armed and disciplined. Character. \u2014 No general character will apply to the inhabitants at large. There is so little uniformity, that it is difficult to trace any governing principles among them. An open and friendly hospitality, particularly to strangers, is an ornamental charac teristic of a great part of this people. Literature. \u2014 There is a respectable college at Athens, 94 miles west-north-west of Augusta, styled Franklin College, and provision is made for an academy in each county. Towns. \u2014 Milledgeville is the seat of government. It is a flourishing town, pleasantly situated on the Oconee, 300 miles by the river from the sea, 100 west-north-west of Savannah, and contains an elegant state-house, a penitentiary, and an arsenal, all of brick. Population, 2100. Savannah, on the River Savannah, 17 miles from its mouth, is the emporium of the state, and a place of extensive commerce. It is built on a sandy plain, elevated about 40 feet above low tide. The streets are regularly laid out, and planted with trees, called the pride of China. Population, about 4000. Augusta, on the Savannah, 340 miles above the city of Sa vannah, by the river, and 123 by land, is a flourishing town. Immense quantities of cotton, also tobacco, and other produce,"], [94, "88 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW are collected here, and conveyed down the river to Savannah. Population, about 4000. Darien is a flourishing commercial town, near the mouth of the Alatamaha. Among the other towns are Petersburg, on the Savannah, 53 miles above Augusta ; Washington, 50 west-north-west of Au gusta ; Louisville, 110 north-west of Savannah ; Sparta, 25 north-east of Milledgeville, and St. Mary's in the South-east part of the state. Manufactures. \u2014 Sugar is now manufactured to a considerable extent in the low country. The inhabitants in the interior are in the habit of manufacturing their clothing and bedding for common use. The estimated value of manufactures of this state, in the year 1810, was 3,533,387 dollars. Commerce. \u2014 The commerce is extensive, but chiefly carried on by northern ships. The exports, in 1822, amounted to 5,485,000 dollars. The shipping, in 1821, was only 14,000 tons. Banks. \u2014 There is one or more banks inmost ofthe cities and towns which have been mentioned. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 Till within 8 or 10 years, the months of July, Au gust and September, were denominated the sickly season. The summers since that time have been cooler, and epidemic fevers nave raged in the autumnal months. The winters in Georgia are mild and pleasant; snow is seldom or never seen. Face of the Country. \u2014 Georgia, like the state last described, consists of two tracts of land \u2014 an alluvial plain, towards the coast, covered with sands intermixed with swamps ; and a roll ing upland country of good soil towards the mountains. Soil and Agriculture. \u2014 The lands in the upper country are of four sorts. The best are the low grounds. These lie on the rivers and creeks, and have a soil that is a mixture of rich black mould with a small quantity of fine sand. Land bf the second quality is called mulatto land, and has a fine dust of a reddish colour, approaching to clay. Gray land is the third quality. The soil is a mixture of a gray mould. The fourth quality, called barrens, is poor and unproductive. On the dry plains grow large crops of sweet potatoes. The cultivation of cotton is very profitable, and employs almost all the people, to the ex clusion of the other branches of agriculture. Indigo was for merly an important product of this state, but is now generally neglected. \u2014 Cunaw-hee Mountain is the southern termina tion of the Blue Ridge. It rises, like a sugar-loaf, out of the rich plains of Franklin county, and is about 1500 feet above the level of the sea. Rivers. \u2014 The largest rivers are the Savannah, Ogeechee, Alatamaha, Satilla, Oakmulgee, Oconee, St. Mary's, Flint, Chatahoochee, Talapoosa and Coosa. Swamps. \u2014 Okefonoco is an Indian word, and means living"], [95, "OF ALABAMA. 89 f round, or shaking ground. This swamp has been said to be 00 miles in circumference, but is not in fact more than 180. There is another' swamp, called Cypress Swamp, between Flint and Satilla Rivers. Bays. \u2014 There are numerous bays or sounds along the coast, between the islands and the main. Zoology. \u2014 Alligators abound in the rivers of Georgia, and there are great numbers of reptiles, many of a venomous kind. The number of frogs also is prodigious. Musquitoes swarm like the flies of Egypt, around the swamps and low grounds. The cochineal insect is found in great numbers on the leaves of the cactus opuntia, on the southern part ofthe coast. Mineral Waters. \u2014 There are several valuable mineral springs, but the most celebrated are Indian Springs, 16 miles from Mon ticello. These springs are much resorted to in summer. Natural Curiosities. \u2014 Tuccoa Falls, in Franklin county, near the north-west corner of Georgia, form a most beautiful cataract of 133 feet in perpendicular height. The stream on which they are situated rises from Chatahoochee Ridge, 5 miles distant, but is not very large. The water is precipitated with singular beauty over a perpendicular rock, and, when the stream is full, it passes down the precipice without being broken. Nicojack Cave. \u2014 At Nicojack, in the Cherokee country, in the north-west corner of Georgia, is a remarkable cave. It is half a mile from the south bank of Tennessee River, situated in Rac coon Mountain, which fronts to the north-east. Immense layers of horizontal limestone form a precipice of considerable height. In this precipice is the entrance of the cave, with a mouth 160 feet wide, and 50 high. Its roof is formed by a solid and reg ular layer of limestone, having no support but the sides of the cave, and as level as the floor of a house. From its entrance it consists chiefly of one grand excavation through the rocks, pre serving for a great distance the same dimensions as at its mouth. The most remarkable circumstance respecting it is, that it forms for the whole distance, as far as it has been explored, a walled and vaulted passage, for a stream of cool and limpid water, which, where it leaves the cave, is 60 feet wide, and 6 deep. A few years since, Col. Ore, of Tennessee, traced the course of this stream in a canoe for the distance of 3 miles. He then came to a fall of water, which obliged him to return. He entered the cave in the morning, and did not return till the evening, hav ing been busily engaged for 12 hours in his subterranean voyage. ALABAMA. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY.

Divisions.\u2014 This state is divided into 22 counties. Population. \u2014 The population, in 1820, was 144,317, of whom 41,859 were slaves. Name. \u2014 This state takes its name from the Indian name of its principal river. Government \u2014 Alabama was raised to the rank of a state in 1819. The act of congress, which admits this state into the Union, on an equal footing with the original states, authorizes the citizens of Alabama to form themselves a constitution, and determines the qualifications, and the number of tbe representa tives to the general assembly, from the several counties ; 44 in the whole. Militia. \u2014 No returns have yet been made of the number of the militia. . Manners and Customs. \u2014 These are mixed and various, accord ing to the manners and customs of the states and nations, from which these new settlers have been collected. They have not been together a sufficient time to form a regular and uniform character. Literature. \u2014 The act of congress constituting this state re serves, on certain conditions, section No. 16, in every township, for the use of its schools. Land is also reserved to be appropri ated to the support of a college. Huntsville may be considered the seat of literature. Towns. \u2014 Cahawba is situated on the Alabama, at the junc tion ofthe River Cahawba, 150 miles north by east of Mobile. It was laid out in 1819, and in 1821 contained 1200 inhabitants. Mobile and Blakely are the principal ports. Mobile is sit uated at tbe head of Mobile Bay, 33 miles north of its entrance into the Gulf of Mexico. Population, 2500. Blakely is situated on the east channel of the Mobile, 12 miles east-north-east of Mobile. Huntsville, in the northern part of the state, 11 miles north of the River Tennessee, and about 220 north of Cahawba, is a flourishing town, situated in a very fertile district. Population, 1500. Tuscaloosa, the seat of government, is a thriving town, at the head of navigation, on the Black Warrior or Tuscaloosa River, 97 miles north of Cahawba. Some of the other principal towns are St. Stephen's, at the head of schooner navigation, on the Tombeckbe ; Claiborne, at the head of schooner navigation, on the Alabama ; Florence, on the Tennessee, at the lower end ofthe Muscle Shoals. Banks.- \u2014 There are three banks at Alabama, \u2014 one at Hunts ville and St. Stephen's, and a branch of the United States' Bank at Mobile. Manufactures and Commerce. \u2014 Both these are yet in their in fancy, and no official returns have been made. The prospects,"], [97, "91 OF MISSISSIPPI. in regard to both, are highly favourable. Its commerce is al ready very considerable. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Face ofthe Country. \u2014 The southern part is low and level: the northern is elevated and diversified ; in some parts moun tainous. The Alleghany Mountains terminate in the north-east part. Soil and Productions. \u2014 A large portion of the soil is very fer tile, and adapted to the various purposes of agriculture ; but the staple production is cotton. Rivers. \u2014 The two most important rivers are the Alabama and Tombeckbe, which unite 45 miles ahove Mobile Bay, to form Mobile River. The Alabama and Tombeckbe afford a schooner navigation upwards of 100 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, and a boat navigation far into the interior. I Springs.\u2014 The salt springs in this state are reserved for public use, and are not to be sold. Mineralogy. \u2014 Great quantities of excellent coal are found in several places ; also iron ore. Petrifactions are very common in the northern parts. MISSISSIPPI. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent. \u2014 The act of congress of March, 1817, establishing this state, prescribes the following limits : Beginning on the Mississippi River, at the point where the southern boundary line of the state of Tennessee strikes the same ; thence east, along the same boundary line, to the Tennessee River; thence up the same to the mouth of Bear Creek ; thence, by a direct line, to the north-west corner ofthe county of Washington ; thence due south to the Gulf of Mexico ; thence westwardly, including all the islands within six leagues of the shore, to the most eastern junction of Pearl River with Lake Borgne ; thence up said river to the thirty-first degree of north latitude ; thence west, along this line of latitude to the Mississippi River ; thence up the same to the beginning. Boundaries. \u2014 It lies between 30\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 north latitude, and 88\u00b0 20' and 91\u00b0 30' west longitude ; and is 350 miles long, from north to south, and, on an average, about 130 broad, containing about 45,000 square miles, or 29,000,000 of acres. It is bounded on the north by Tennessee ; east by Alabama ; south by the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana ; and west by the Mississippi River. Divisions. \u2014 All the northern parts of the state are yet occu pied by the Indians. The part which has been divided into counties lies south of the mouth of the Yazoo River, and com prehends less than one third of the whole state. The names of the counties are, Warren, Claiborne, Jefferson, Adams, Wil-"], [98, "92 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW kinson, Franklin, Amite, Lawrence, Pike, Marion, Wayne,.

Of these the five first lie upon the Mississippi River, between the mouth of the Yazoo ana the southern boundary of the state, and contain two thirds of the whole population, on a territory of about 2500 square miles. Franklin and Amite lie directly east of Adams and Wilkinson. The remaining counties lie south-east of the others. Hancock county borders on the Gulf of Mexico. Name. \u2014 This state takes its name from the river which forms its western boundary. Religion. \u2014 There is a very great deficiency in the means of religious instruction, and there are few preachers of education, or who possess the qualifications for teachers of religious truth. The principal denominations scattered through the state are Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions have made some efforts for extending the privileges of Chris tianity to the Indians, and have established missionary stations among the Choctaws at Elliot, and among the Cherokees at Brainerd. Both have been encouraged by the pleasing success that has attended them. Laws. \u2014 The fourth section of the act of congress admitting this state into the Union, provides that every tract of land sold by congress shall be exempt from any tax laid by the state, whether for state, county, town, parish, or other purposes, for the term of five years from the day of sale ; and that the lands belonging to the citizens of the United States residing without the state, shall never be taxed higher than the lands belonging to persons residing therein ; and that no tax shall be imposed on lands the property of the United States ; and that the River Mississippi, and the navigable streams and rivers leading into the same, or into the Gulf of Mexico, shall be common highways, and for ever free to all the citizens of the United States, without any tax, duty, impost, or toll therefor, imposed by the state. Population. \u2014 According to the census of 1820, the population of Mississippi amounted to 75,000, of whom 32,814 were slaves. A very considerable number of emigrants are annually removing into this state, and the institutions of government, literature and religion will probably be multiplied proportionably to the increase of population. Literature. \u2014 Jefferson College, in the town of Washington, was incorporated in 1802 ; but the institution cannot yet be ranked higher than a respectable academy. Another college has been recently incorporated in Shieldsborough. There are academies at Natchez, Monticello, and Woodville. Towns. \u2014 Natchez, on the Mississippi, 320 miles by the river, and 156 by land, above New Orleans, is much the largest town. It is situated on a bluff or bank, elevated about 150 feet above the river, and has a flourishing trade. All the other towns are small. Jackson, the seat of government, is a new town on Pearl River, near the head. Some of the other more considerable"], [99, "OF MISSISSIPPI. 93 places are, Washington, six miles north by east of Natchez \u2022 Woodville. 37 miles south of Natchez ; Port Gibson, 35 miles' north by east of Natchez ; Monticello, on Pearl River, 90 miles east of Natchez ; Shieldsborough, on the Bay of St. Louis, 40 miles north-east of New Orleans. Elliot, on the Yalo Busha, 130 miles above Natchez, is a missionary station amono- the Choctaws. a Manufactures.\u2014 The manufactures in Mississippi are few, as the cotton, which forms the staple article of growth, is mostly exported, or manufactured in the Northern and Middle States, where the density of population requires a greater quantity of cotton goods. Bank.\u2014 A bank is established at Natchez, with a capital of $3,000,000, having several branches. Commerce.\u2014 Cotton is the principal article of exportation. Tobacco and indigo were formerly important articles of com merce, but the former is nearly, and the latter entirely abandon ed by the planters, in consequence ofthe increasing demand for cotton and the facilities which new inventions have afforded for its preparation for the manufacturer. Most of the flour and grain consumed in the settlements on the Mississippi, is pur chased from the boats ofthe interior and northern country. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate.\u2014 Tbe country on the Mississippi, from the Yazoo to the southern boundary of the state, is salubrious, except the parts immediately adjacent to the river. The surface is dry and waving, little or no marshy land exists, and the spring and well water is excellent. The inhabitants here are said to enjoy as fine health as in any other part ofthe world of the same latitude, and the weather, from September to April, is uniformly pleasant. Face of the Country. \u2014 The southern part of the territory, about 100 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, is mostly a flat coun- try, with occasional hills of moderate elevation, and is covered with forests of the long-leaved pine, interspersed with the cy- press swamps, open prairies, and inundated marshes. A con- siderable portion of this part is susceptible of cultivation. In proceeding north, the face of the country becomes more elevated and agreeably diversified. Mountains. \u2014 There are no very considerable mountains with- in the limits of Mississippi. At Loftus Heights, in the south- west corner of the state, a ridge of land commences and pursues a north-eastern course into the Indian country, separating the waters which flow into the Buffalo, the Homochitto and Yazoo, from those w-hich flow into the Amite and into the Pearl. Though this ridge is not very elevated, there is a sensible dif ference of climate on the opposite sides. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The counties lying west of the di viding ridge, and bordering upon the Mississippi, are the most fer tile parts of the state in possession of the whites. The western"], [100, "94 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW border of this section is formed by the banks of the Mississippi. The extensive bottoms of these tracts are liable to an annual inundation from th\u00bb river, and the whole extent of the surface thus inundated is estimated at 6000 square miles. There are but few places in tbe United States, where the soil affords more diversity than does the country watered by the Yazoo, Big Black, Homochitto, Buffalo, and the numerous streams in their vicinity. No part ofthe earth is more congenial than this to the growth of cotton, and this useful plant flourishes luxuriantly in this warm and waving soil. After leaving the level, inundated bottoms of the Mississippi, and ascending into the interior, the surface of the country is generally composed of rich loam, and thickly tim bered with a great variety of trees. Upon land thus richly clad by nature have arisen the fine farms that now pour such abundant wealth into the lap of their owners. Though the cultivation of the vegetables and the richest species of fruits would- be abundantly successful, yet the growth of cotton, which is attended with such enormous profits, is so much more lucrative, that this state will probably, for a long time to come, be supplied with its grain and fruits from the country lying above. Rivers. \u2014 The Mississippi forms the western boundary of the state, and has already been particularly described. The other principal rivers are, the Yazoo, which runs almost entirely with in the Indian country, and affords a navigation for the distance of 100 miles ; the Big Black, navigable about 70 miles ; the Ho mochitto, rising in the Indian country, and flowing south-west into the Mississippi ; the Buffalo and the Pearl Rivers, which last is the largest stream between the Mobile and Mississippi, but its navigation is much impeded by shallows ; the Pascagou la, which is navigable for vessels drawing four feet of water about 50 miles. The Tennessee also flows through this state. Natural Curiosities. \u2014 About 300 miles north-east of Natchez are immense beds of oyster shells, extending at intervals through a distance of twelve miles. The shells do not cover the surface of the earth merely; but form a constituent part of the hills or plains in which they are found. The Spanish moss, which is met with in the Choctaw nation, about 300 miles from New Or leans, is also a curiosity. This singular vegetable attaches itself to the branches of the trees, and hangs loosely from them, having the colour and appearance of dressed flax. Zoology. \u2014 Game in this state is scarce ; but tigers, bears, wolves, wild-cats and foxes are sound in the forests skirting the Mississippi. The alligator inhabits the streams south of latitude 52\u00b0. The teeth of this animal are short and irregular, and the jaws remarkably strong. If they are successful in seizing their prey, they never suffer it to escape. On the approach of rainy weather, they make a bellowing noise, which may be heard at the distance of half a mile."], [101, "OF LOUISIANA. 95 LOUISIANA. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent\u2014 This state lies between 29\u00b0 and 33\u00b0 N. lat., and be tween 89\u00b0 and 94\u00b0 10' W. lon. Its greatest length, from north to south, is 270 miles ; and its greatest breadth, from east to west, is 300 miles ; its breadth on the northern border is 174 miles. It is estimated to contain 48,220 square miles. Boundaries. \u2014 It is bounded north by Arkansas Territory, east by the state of Mississippi, south by the Gulf of Mexico, and west by the Spanish dominions. Divisions. \u2014 The state appears to be divisible into three great natural sections ; \u2014 the northern, embracing, in general, the country north of the parallel of 31\u00b0 ; the south-eastern, embrac ing all the country below that parallel, and east of the Atcha falaya River ; and the south-western section, including the re mainder ofthe state lying west of that river. The civil division is into parishes. In tbe northern section are, Natchitoches, Ouachitta, Rapides, Ocatahoola, Concordia, Avoyelles. In the south-eastern section are, Placquemines, Orleans, St. Ber nard, St. Charles, St. John Baptiste, St. James, Ascension, As sumption, Interior of La Fourche.'Iberville, West Baton Rouge, Point Coupee, New Feliciana, East Baton Rouge, St. Helena, St. Tammany. In the south-western section are, St. Mary's and St. Martin's, (Attacapas,) St. Landre, (Opelousas.) Name. \u2014 The name of Louisiana was given to this country in honour of Louis XIV., and was originally applied to the whole country west of the Mississippi, included within the limits of the present state of Louisiana, and of the Arkansas and Missouri Territories. Religion. \u2014 The majority of the population of the state are Roman Catholics, though the clergy of the order are not very numerous. Within the last fifteen years, Protestant mission aries, of several denominations, have visited the country, and established churches in various places in the state. No regard is paid to the Sabbath, by the great mass of the people in the state. Dancing, gambling, parties of pleasure, and theatrical amusements, are the common business of the day, in the city of New Orleans, after mass in the morning. A change for the better, in regard to the low state of religion and morals, has already successfully commenced. Men of high standing and influence are engaged with becoming zeal in this work of reform. Government. \u2014 The legislature is composed of a senate, of 17 members, and a house of representatives, of 34 members. The government is as yet well balanced between the French and American party. In 1818, the French had the majority in the house of representatives, and the Americans in the senate. The governor, treasurer and secretary of state were French. In the superior court, two of the judges were French, and one"], [102, "96 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW American. Of the district judges, six were Americans, and only one French. , Population. \u2014 The number of inhabitants in this state, accord ing to the census for 1820, was 153,000, of whom 69,064 were slaves. This population is principally settled on the banks of the Mississippi, from Point Coupee to some distance below New Orleans, on both sides of the river. Through the w7hole dis tance, of more than 100 miles, the banks present the appearance of almost a continued village. The inhabitants of the upper parts of these settlements are Canadians ; of the middle, Ger mans ; and in the lower parts are French and Spanish, from Europe. Militia. \u2014 The number of militia, in 1827, amounted to 92.33. Revenue. \u2014 The revenue of Louisiana, in 1815, amounted to 985,000 dollars, and increases in proportion to the consumption of foreign goods, which are needed to supply the growing pop ulation of the immense valley of the Mississippi. Character. \u2014 In journeying from New Orleans to the mouth ofthe Sabine River, we meet with men hi every stage of civili zation. In New Orleans, and other places on the banks of the Mississippi, the sugar and cotton planters live in splendid edi fices, and enjoy all the luxuries that wealth can impart. In At tacapas and Opelous^as7, the glare of expensive luxury vanishes, and is followed by substantial independence. Often the loom occupies one part of the common sitting room or parlour, of families really wealthy. The farmers in this part of the country count their cattle by the thousand. Hospitality and bravery are mentioned as common characteristics of the people in this part ofthe state. Literature. \u2014 Education has hitherto been deplorably neglect ed, and, till very recently, they were almost without schools. .Of the French inhabitants, not one in ten can read. The gov ernment is now turning its attention to the establishment of schools, academies, and higher seminaries of learning, in differ ent parts of the country. A Catholic college has been estab lished in New Orleans, which is said to be pretty well endowed. Totvns. \u2014 New Orleans, the capital, is the only large town. It is built on the east bank of the Mississippi, 100 miles, by the river, from its mouth. It is admirably situated for commerce'', on one of the largest rivers in the world, whose numerous branches, extending many hundred miles in different directions, wast to this port the products of different climes. Since it has belonged to the United States, it has become one of the greatest empo riums of commerce in America. New Orleans is built on ground lower than the surface ofthe river, and is protected from inun dation by an embankment called the levee, which extends 160 miles in length. The city is subject to great ravages from the yellow fever. The population, in 1800, was 10,000 ; in 1820, '27,176. Baton Rouge is situated on the east bank of the Mississippi, 150 miles, by the river abeve New Orleans. It is built on the"], [103, "OF LOUISIANA. 97 first eminence that is seen in ascending the Mississippi, and is elevated twenty-five or thirty feet above high water mark. Population, 1100. Alexandria is situated on Red River, 346 miles, by water, north-easterly from New Orleans. 180 in a direct line. > It has considerable trade, and employs several steamboats. Popula tion, 700. The other principal towns are Natchitoches on Red River, St. Francisville on the Mississippi, Donaldsonvdle and Madisonville on the same river, and St. Martinsville on the Teche. Manufactures. \u2014 The manufactures of this state are extremely inconsiderable. The whole amount invested, in 1810, was 81,200,000. Commerce. \u2014 The commerce is great, and is daily augmenting, as the facilities for navigating the Mississippi and its branches are continually multiplied. The productive valley of the Mis sissippi pours -its abundance into New Orleans, which consists chiefly us cotton, sugar and molasses. This is the port of entry and clearance for all articles of commerce, and possesses most ofthe shipping belonging to the state. The amount of exports from the state, in 1820, was $7,979,000. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 About 30\u00b0 north latitude may be assumed as the region of snow ; few instances occur of its falling below that parallel. There is a singular coincidence between the line where snow ceases and sugar cane1 commences. Many attempts have been made to cultivate sugar cane above 31\u00b0 north latitude, some of which produced delusive results, as no instance has yet occurred, where the existence of that plant was not found pre carious, when attempted in places where snow had been fre quent. The southern parts of this state in summer are hot, sultry and unhealthy. The northern parts are more temperate and healthy. Face of the Country. \u2014 The southern section of this state includes the delta of the Mississippi. The country about the mouths of the river, for thirty miles, is one continued swamp, destitute of trees, and covered with a species of coarse reed, four or five feet high. Nothing can be more dreary than a prospect from a ship's mast while passing the immense waste. The Mississippi flows upon a raised ridge or platform, its two banks forming long mounds, which are elevated many feet above the level of the surrounding country. Below 30\u00b0 north latitude, the waters often cover the whole country. The whole extent of land, over which the inundation reaches, on the Mississippi and Red River, is estimated at 10,890 square miles ; but within this surface there are many tracts which are never covered. The best lands consist of the immediate banks of the river, which are from a mile to a mile and a half broad, and are seldom or never 9"], [104, "98 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW overflowed. They are extremely rich, and sell by the front acre, the depth of each tract being forty, and sometimes eighty acres ; but only the seventy acres nearest the river are dry enough to be susceptible of cultivation. To protect this ground from inundation, a levee, or artificial embankment of earth, from five feet to thirty in height, is raised upon the natural bank of the river, at the distance of thirty or forty yards back from the usual margin of the water. Each proprietor is bound to keep up the levee in front of his own land, and on some plantations one sixth ofthe annual labour is employed in repairing these works. The water sometimes bursts these artificial barriers, and rushes out with a noise like the roaring of a cataract, boil ing and foaming, and tearing every thing before it. When a breach of this kind is made, which is called a crevasse, the in habitants, for miles above and below, abandon every employ ment, and hasten to the spot, where every exertion is made, night and day, to re-establish the levee ; but more frequently the destructive element is suffered to take its course. The consequences are, that the flood overthrows the buildings, and sweeps away the crop, and often the soil, leaving the surface strewed with numerous logs and trees, which must be destroyed before the land can be again cultivated. Productions. \u2014 The staple productions of Louisiana are cotton, sugar and rice. The cotton plantations are the most extensive, but those of the sugar are rapidly increasing in the southern parts of the state. There is a vast extent of lands adapted to the cultivation of rice, and which will be used for this purpose, whenever the demand for this article shall render it necessary. The fruits most generally cultivated are the peach, orange and fig. Plums, grapes and pomegranates grow7 luxuriantly, and produce abundantly. Rivers. \u2014 The Mississippi is the great river of Louisiana. The Red River rises in Mexico, in the Rocky Mountains, and flows into the Mississippi, 240 miles above New Orleans. It is navi gable two thirds of the year for large steamboats as far as Alexandria. The other principal rivers are the \\v achita, or Ouachitta, and the Sabine River. Lakes. \u2014 There is a chain of lakes, which wash the eastern side of the island of New Orleans, the principal of which are Pontchartrain, Maurepas, Borgne, Mermentau, Billineau and Sabine. - Springs. \u2014 Salt springs are frequent upon all the streams be tween Ouachitta and Red River. Two or three of these springs are in operation, and the principal manufactory of salt is in the neighbourhood of Natchitoches. There are springs on the Ouachitta and Dugdomoni, equally productive with that near Natchitoches, and capable of supplying the wants of the coun try in its vicinity. . / ."], [105, "OF TENNESSEE. 99 TENNESSEE. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent\u2014 The extreme length of Tennessee is 430 miles, and its breadth is 204 miles. It lies between 81\u00b0 30' and 90\u00b0 30' W. longitude, and between 35\u00b0 and 36\u00b0 30' N. latitude, and con tains an area of 41,300 square miles. Boundaries. \u2014 It is bounded on the north by Kentucky and part of Virginia; east by North Carolina; south by Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi ; west by the River Mississippi. Its shape is rhomboidal. Divisions. \u2014 The Cumberland Mountains divide this state into two parts,\u2014 East and West Tennessee. The counties in East Tennessee are, Anderson, Bledsoe, Blount, Campbell, Carter, Claiborne, Cocke, Granger, Greene, Hamilton, Hawkins, Jeffer son, Knox, Marion, McMinn, Monroe, Morgan, Rhea, Roane, Sevier, Sullivan, Washington. In West Tennessee the coun ties are, Bedford, Davidson, Dickson, Franklin, Giles, Hardman, Hickman, Humphries, Jackson, Lawrence, Lincoln, Montgome ry, Maury, Overton, Perry, Robinson, Rutherford, Shelby, Sumner, Smith, Stuart, Wayne, Wilson, Williamson, White, Warren. Name. \u2014 This state takes its name from its principal river. The Indians are said to have given this name to the river on account of its curvature, which gave to their imaginations the form of an Indian spoon, which is the meaning of the name. Religion. \u2014 The most numerous denominations of Christiana in this state are Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians. Many ofthe preachers are persons of limited attainments in learning; whose discourses are consequently better calculated to excite the passions than to enlighten the understanding. The build ings erected for public worship are very ordinary, and indeed, in a country so new, splendid edifices are not to be expected. But, doubtless, from the increase of population in Tennessee, which contains many professors of religion, larger and more convenient places for public worship will soon be erected. Government. \u2014 By the constitution of this state, formed in 1776, the legislative authority is vested in a general assembly, consisting of a senate and house of representatives ; the num ber of representatives to be fixed once in seven years, by the legislature, according to the number of taxable inhabitants, who are to be numbered septennially. The executive power of the state is vested in a governor, who is chosen by the electors who elect the members of the legisla ture : the person having the highest number of votes is chosen. Population.\u2014 The population of Tennessee, in 1790, was 35,691, and in 1820, it was 422,813, of whom 72,157 were slaves. Militia. \u2014 There are several companies of cavalry in this state, and some of infantry, which are tolerably expert ; though, in general, the militia are fur from being well disciplined. The"], [106, "100 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW number of militia, in 1817, was 29,193. They would make ex cellent partisan warriors ; their hands and their eyes are familiar with the rifle ; and there is too much Indian in them not to un derstand scouting. They are hardy, and used to privations, and must prove formidable to any enemy, that should attempt an in vasion of their territory or their rights. Revenue. \u2014 This is raised by taxation, but the taxes are very low ; as each 100 acres of land pays annually to the state only 12i cents ; a free poll, the same ; and a slave, 25 cents. Every merchant or pedler pays 20 dollars a year in each county where he exhibits his goods for sale. Character. \u2014 There seems to be-a greater resemblance between Tennessee and the Southern States, than the Northern. The character ofthe inhabitants, however, is not yet completely de veloped, and there appears a constant change in their habits and practices, which shows that they are yet under the influence of the circumstances that attend the growing condition of any country. The progress of civilization is followed by the light of knowl edge, and as knowledge elevates the intellectual powers of men, they look at the great purposes of society, and make wise pro visions for the security of its interests. Literature. \u2014 Acts of incorporation were passed by the territo rial government, in 1794, for three colleges in East Tennessee. The first, called Washington College, in Washington county ; the second, called Greenville College, in Greene ; and a third in Knox county. The two first are in a flourishing condition, and under the charge of instructors, who are well qualified for their charge, and deserve well for their assiduity. In West Tennes see, there is a college at Nashville, called Cumberland College, which is under tlie charge of a president and tutor. The donation from congress for these colleges consisted of 100,000 acres of land, which has been disposed of at one dollar per acre. Another 100,000 acres they conferred, also, for the support of academies, one in each county. A spirit for education seems to be increasing. Language.\u2014 The national language is uniformly spoken, for as foreigners come mostly by single families, they cannot pre serve their different dialects, hut are under the necessity of con forming to the language ofthe place. Towns. \u2014 Murfreesborough, lately the seat of government, is pleasantly situated 32 miles south-east of Nashville, and is a thriving town, containing about 1,200 inhabitants. \u2014 Nashville is the capital town, and the largest in the state. It is situated on the Cumberland, in a fertile and populous country, and contains upwards of 5,000 inhabitants. The other most considerable towns in West Tennessee are Franklin, Fayetteville, Sljelbyville, Columbia, Clarksville, Carthage and Gallatin. Knoxville, in East Tennessee, is pleasantly situated on the Hols ton, with a population of 2,000. The other principal towns in East Tennessee are, Jonesborough, Greenville, and Rogersville,"], [107, "101 OF TENNESSEE. Manufactures. \u2014 In East Tennessee, there are several estab lishments for the manufacture of iron, a rolling and slitting mdl, and two paper mills. Iron is also wrought to some extent in West Tennessee, and there are several machines for the spin ning of cotton, and several for the manufacture of hemp into bagging and ropes. Salt is also made in great quantities in this state. The value ofthe manufactures, inl810, was $3,600,000. Banks. \u2014 There are banks among the public institutions of Murfreesborough and Nashville. Commerce. \u2014 The principal exports from this state have hitherto been coiton and tobacco. But the common articles of produc tion in the Middle and Northern States are more generally and abundantly raised as the country becomes more thickly in habited, and the different qualities of soil are brought under the hand of cultivation. Goods imported are brought into East Tennessee in wagons, from Baltimore and Philadelphia, and to West Tennessee, principally as far as to Pittsburg, and then by water down the Ohio and up the Cumberland. The commerce of this state will be facilitated by the construction of contem plated canals, and will equal, in this department of active society, that of the states in its neighbourhood. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The climate of this state has been called the mid dle climate ofthe United States, in consequence ofthe influence which the mountains, that extend over this and the neighbour ing states, have upon it. The season of vegetation commences six or seven weeks earlier than in New Hampshire, and con tinues as much later, making a difference of three months. There are some cold days in winter, and annually some snow. Ten inches is a deep snow, and ton days an extraordinary term for its duration. ' The piercing northerly winds, that prevail during the winter, in the Atlantic States, seldom affect the in habitants of this state ; for they have no great mountains to the northward or westward. North-easterly storms never reach this country. Face of the Count n/.\u2014 Tennessee is one ofthe most pleasant, healthful, and beautiful states in the Union. It is free of the barren, sandy tracts, and great swamps, so common in the states of the south, and enjoys a richer soil, as well as better climate, than those ofthe north. Cumberland Mountain passes through the state obliquely, and divides it into two equal valleys, which are intersected by Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. East Tennessee, in which is the nucleus of the Alleghany Mountains, is more broken than West Tennessee, where the mountains, in their western course, gradually subside, and terminate in a plain before they reach the Mississippi. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The soil is a mixture ; a great propor tion of it clay. On Cumberland, Duck, and many other rivers, it is of a very superior quality. Corn is produced in great abun dance, and the soil is well adapted to the growth of hemp, flax, 9*"], [108, "102 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW7 and for sweet potatoes ; vines, garden plants and fruit trees grow luxuriantly, and, as far as experiment has been made, grasses have been found to flourish, both for pastures and meadows. Rivers. \u2014 The two great rivers of the state are the Cumber land and Tennessee. There are several boatable rivers flowing westerly into these, the principal of which are the Holston, Clinch, French Broad, Nolachucky, Hiwassee, and Duck. These rivers water abundantly both East and West Tennessee, and afford to the inhabitants of almost every part ofthe state the facilities of water carriage for the surplus productions of the soil. Mountains. \u2014 The mountains of this state are ribs of the Alle ghany. They form a ridge, which separates this state from North Carolina. Its general course, as well as that of most of the others, is nearly from the north-east to the south-west. Cumberland Mountain is the largest eminence of the state. In its whole extent, from the Great Kenhawa to the Tennessee, it consists of the most stupendous piles of craggy rocks of any mountain in the western country. In several places even the Indians are not able to ascend these lofty summits, and in one place particularly, there is a most remarkable ledge of rocks, about thirty miles in length, and two hundred feet thick, show ing a perpendicular face to the south-east, far more noble than any artificial fortification in the known world, and apparently equal in point of regularity. Springs. \u2014 On the waters of the French Broad River is a fine, large, clear, medicinal, warm spring, to which invalids from the Carolinas and Virginia have often resorted with benefit. When the improved state ofthe country shall afford sufficient accom modations, this spring will probably be as much resorted to as those of the back parts of Virginia, being more convenient to the Southern States, and equally efficacious in healing diseases. There are also salt springs in this state, but they have not yet been productive, as salt has been procured from the vicinity on such terms as to discourage the manufacture of it from these waters. Botany. \u2014 The kinds of trees and plants found in this state are the same as belong to the same latitude in other parts ofthe United States. The forests afford almost every variety of tim ber, and yield the several species of nuts, which the harder woods produce. The under-growth in many places, and especially in low grounds, is cane, some of which is twenty feet high, and so thick as to prevent any other plant from growing. There are also Virginia and Seneca snakeroot, ginseng, Carolina pink, angelica, senna, lobelia, Indian physic, spicewood, wild plum, sweet anise, red bud ginger, spikenard, wild hop, and grape vines. The glades are covered with wild rye, wild oats, clover, buffalo grass, strawberries and pea vines. On the hills, at the heads of the rivers, are found majestic red' cedars, many of which are four feet in diameter, and forty feet clear of limbs. Mineralogy. \u2014 Iron is found in every part of the state in suffi cient quantities to supply all the inhabitants, and the lower"], [109, "OF KENTUCKY. 103 countries which are destitute. Copperas is made in West Ten nessee, which contains a profusion of this mineral, as well as of alum. Great quantities of saltpetre are also manufactured from the nitrous caves. Some lead mines have been discovered. In the mountains are found the material for excellent grindstones ; in some places vast beds of slate. There is also a variety of flint, different sulphurets, beds of fossil coal, marble and limestone. Natural Curiosities. \u2014 The Suck or Whirl in the Tennessee River forms an object of curiosity. As the waters, in their pas sage through the Cumberland Mountains, approach the opening which they have forced through the rocks, a huge rock projects from the northern shore, and forces the stream from its direct course, and the current, opposed in its fearful impetuosity, hur ries with tremendous violence to the opposite side of the pass, and rebounds with grand sublimity before it again rolls on its course to the ocean. The river in this spot is compressed to the width of 70 feet. There are several caves, some of which have been explored, and others are too small to be entered, and too deep to be fathomed. There are on the mountains bordering on Tennessee the singular appearances of the footsteps of various animals of the forest, and the prints of men's feet of a peculiar form and size. Mr. Fisk has given a description of these curious appearances, and says that the impressions of human feet have uniformly six toes, with the exception of one track, which he considers that of a negro. One of these tracks is very remarkable, being of the monstrous dimensions of 16 inches long, 13 wide between the extremities of the outer toes, and the diameter of the heel ball 5 inches. From the form of these impressions, the origi nals have been supposed to be the progeny of .Titan or Anak. It can hardly be imagined, that all these were the work of play ful nature, or were wrought by the hand of the rude savage, but they probably remain as the chronicle of times long gone by, and testimonials of a race of men long since passed from the earth. To know, in cases like this, is beyond the power of man. KENTUCKY. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent\u2014 This state lies between 36\u00b0 30' and 39\u00b0 10' N. lat. and between 81\u00b0' 30' and 89\u00b0 20' W. lon. Its length is 300 miles ; its greatest breadth, 180 miles, and its least, 40. The Ohio winds along its northern side. The number of square miles is 39,000, or 24,900,000 acres. Thirty thousand square miles were supposed to be inhabited in 1817. Boundaries.\u2014 The Ohio, on the north, separates this state from Ohio, Indiana and Illinois ; Big Sandy River and Cumber land Mountains separate it on the east from Virginia ; Ten nessee lies on the south ; and the Mississippi, on the west, sep arates it from Missouri."], [110, "104 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW Divisions. \u2014 This state is divided into 67 counties, and is en titled to 12 representatives to congress. Name. \u2014 The River Kentucky gives its name to the state. Religion. \u2014 The Baptists are the most numerous denomination of Christians in the state, and the Presbyterians are the second in point of number. The Methodists are considerably numerous, and in principle Wesleyans. These three denominations live in perfect harmony, and have teachers highly respectable for their learning and piety. The laws make no provision for the support of religion, but the institutions of religion are observed w7ith a good degree of zeal. Government. \u2014 The legislature, called the general assembly, consists of a senate and a house of representatives. The num ber of senators is limited to 38, and the conditions of election are, that the member must have resided in the state six years, and in the district one year, and that he be 35 years of age. The number of representatives cannot exceed 100. A member must be a citizen of the United States, and have resided in the state the two years previous to his election, and in the town or county the last of these. Population.- \u2014 The population of Kentucky, in 1790, was 73,677, and, in 1820, was 564,317, including 126,732 slaves. The blacks have increased faster than the whites. Militia. \u2014 The militia of this state, in 1817, amounted to 52,919, and are organized in the manner of the Virginia militia. Most of them are well disciplined, and prepared for efficient warfare, and in the late w-ar were signalized ser their bravery. Character. \u2014 The inhabitants possess all that variety of char acter, which naturally arises from a diversity of education. They are emigrants from almost every state in the Union, and from every country of Europe. A considerable number of the early settlers were men of education and worth, who have im parted a good influence throughout the state. The Kentuck ians are celebrated for their hospitality, and the cheerful recep tion wdiich they offer to strangers and travellers, to their huts and firesides. The wealthy contemn labour, and employ their slaves in every species of work, and make the possession of slaves a. criterion of merit. Literature. \u2014 Transylvania College, at Lexington, is a respect able and flourishing institution, and has connected with it a law school and a medical school. The university depends upon grants from the legislature, and the fees of the students, for the support of its officers, and to defray its expenses ; and these grants have been quite liberal. The legislature granted, a few years since, 6000 acres of land for the support of common schools, of which each county is to receive an equal share. Towns. \u2014 Frankfort, the seat of government, is situated in a hilly country, on Kentucky River, 60 miles above its confluence with the Ohio. Population, 1700. Lexington, the largest town, is pleasantly situated on a branch of the Eikhorn, 22 miles south-east of Elkhorn. It is hand-"], [111, "105 OF KENTUCKY. somcly built, chiefly of brick, and is one of the greatest manu facturing towns in the Western States. The population is 4000. Louisville is situated at the rapids of the Ohio, and has a population of 4000. Russelville, 190 miles south-west of Lex ington, is situated in a very fertile country, with a population 6f 1700. The other most considerable towns are Maysville, Washington, Bairdstown, Paris, Danville, Georgetown, New port, Winchester and Hopkinsville. Manufactures. \u2014 The amount employed in manufacturing es tablishments in Kentucky was, in 1810, $7,200,000. This was invested in tanneries, distilleries, looms, powder and paper nulls, salt works, cotton manufactories, spinning machines, forges and furnaces. - Commerce. \u2014 The staple commodities in this state are hemp, wheat and tobacco. It is but a few years since the planters turned their attention to the cultivation of hemp. These, and the other articles of export, are carried down the Ohio and Mis sissippi to New Orleans, whence the foreign articles of con sumption are chiefly brought up these rivers. Steamboat navi gation will aid the commercial and manufacturing interests of Kentucky to an extent beyond our means to calculate. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The atmosphere of Kentucky is a very moist one, which renders the ground generally muddy throughout the winter, and early in tlie spring. The inhabitants seldom expe rience the extremes of heat and cold. The weather, in spring and fall, is delightful ; snow seldom falls deep, or lasts long ; and the winters, which begin at Christmas, never exceed three months, and commonly only two, and are so mild that cattle subsist without folder. Face of tbe Country. \u2014 The eastern counties are mountainous, those on the Ohio are hillv ; the rest of the country is partly level, and partly undulating.'\" The greatest natural disadvantage of this state is the failure of most of the streams during the summer. Soil and Productions.\u2014 -For fifty miles around Lexington, the soil is exceedingly good : also a district in the south-west, be tween Green ami Cambcrkad Rivers. All the level and undu lating parts lie upon an immense bed of limestone, usually about eight feet below the surface. Its chief agricultural productions are wheat, tobacco, Indian corn, hemp, rye, and, to a small extent, cotton. Vineyards have been found to succeed. Rivers.\u2014 The Ohio bounds the state on the north, the Missis sippi on the west, and the Big Sandy on the east. The Tennes see and 'Cumberland flow through the western part. The other principal rivers are the Kentucky, Green, Barren and Licking. Springs.\u2014 The Olympian Springs are near the sources of Lickino- River, in a delightful and romantic situation. There are three different kinds of water within the space of half a mile- One of these is salt water, impregnated with sulphur and"], [112, "106 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW l carbonic acid; another is impregnated with iron, and is an ex cellent chalybeate ; the third is merely a sulphur spring. There is another spring in Mercer county, strongly impregnated with Epsom salts, besides several other salt springs or licks. Mineralogy. \u2014 Iron ore abounds in various places ; but the metal is not of the best quality. It is well adapted for hollow ware, but does not answer for malleable iron. This superior sort is procured from Pittsburg. There is an immense quarry of marble on tbe banks of the Kentucky, which is of a grayish cast, beautifully variegated, and susceptible of a high polish. On the banks of tlie same river, 20 miles from Lexington, there is a peculiar mineral, which is semi-transparent, always breaks in a rhomboidal form, and has the double refracting power of tlie Iceland crystal. , Natural Curiosities. \u2014 There are caves in the south-west part ofthe state, which are great curiosities. One, styled Mammoth Cave, or the Great Cave of Kentucky, is situated in Warren county, in a country broken, but not mountainous, 130 miles south-west of Lexington. It has been explored to the extraor dinary distance of 16 miles, and is found to contain numerous apartments and avenues, one of which comprises an area of eight acres, without a single pillar to support it, and is from 60 to 100 feet high. In some parts of the cavern are the most beautiful and splendid columns of brilliant spar, sixty or seventy feet in height. The cavern abounds in nitre, and the air within is pure and salubrious. There are also the remains of fortifications in a good state of preservation, although they are buried beneath tbe wood of a third growth since the erection of these piles. They discover in the construction an ingenuity and skill far superior to any ofthe works of the present generation of savage Indians, and must have been the work of some race of men, who possessed the land long before the variety of our species, whom we have dispos sessed of it, had wandered into the region. It is a curious sub ject of speculation, to trace from the buried remains and works of art, that are scattered through this fertile country, the char acter of those who originally formed theu.. The truth of the matter, however, is left untold, and must sleep in silence, unless some more sure re-'-.-f! bU*11 reveal it. than the fanciful tradition of the Indians, or the still obscurer traces which are found among these ruins. OHIO. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent\u2014 Ohio lies between 38\u00b0 30' and '42\u00b0 N. lat., and be tween 80\u00b0 35' and 84\u00b0 47' VV. lon. Its mean length, from north to south, is 200 miles, and its mean breadth is 190. Its area is 38,500 square miles, equal to about 24,000,000 acres. Boundaries. \u2014 Ohio is bounded on the north by Michigan"], [113, "OF OHIO. 107 Territory and Upper Canada ; on the east by Pemisvlvania ; on the south by Virginia and Kentucky ; and on the west'by Indiana. Divisions. \u2014 In 1620, the number of counties in this state was fifty-nine, and there are no divisions but these civil ones. Religion. \u2014 The principal denominations of Christians in Ohio are the Presbyterians, who had, in 1817, 48 ministers ; Method ists, who had 34 .ministers ; Baptists, who had 13 ; Newlights of the Christian Church, who had 9 teachers ; and the Episcopa lians, Seceders and Congregationalists ; also the meetings of Friends in this state and Indiana were 59. Government. \u2014 The legislative authority of this state is vested in a general assembly, composed of a senate, to be chosen bien nially; and a house of representatives, to be chosen annually, both by the people ; the representatives to be proportioned by law, from time to time, to the population. The senators are to be divided into two classes by lot, the seats of the first class to be vacated at the expiration of tbe first year, and those of the second to be vacated at the end of the second year, so that one half are to be annually chosen. Population. \u2014 The population in this state amounted, in 1790, to no more than 3000, and in 1820 it amounted to 581,434, be sides the Indians. A more recent computation has placed the present number of the inhabitants at 1,000,000. The probabili ty is, that the population will long continue to increase, but not with the same rapidity that it has for the twenty years past. The cheapness and fertility of the land, the security of land titles, and the prohibition of slaves, which increases the price for labour, all go to encourage emigration. Character. \u2014 The inhabitants of this state have not lived to gether long enough to form a fixed and uniform character. The mass of the emigrants have been farmers from the Northern and Middle States, who were, in general, industrious, temperate, and frugal, with as much intelligence, and even more enterprise than the people ofthe states from which they emigrated. The Sabbath and other religious institutions are better supported than generally is sound to be the case in new settlements. Literature. \u2014 One thirty-sixth part of the state of Ohio, that is, one section in each town, has been granted by the government ofthe United States, for the support of schools ; besides two or three townships for the establishment of colleges. The two principal colleges are located at Athens and Cincinnati. The Ohio University, at Athens, is endowed with two townships of 40,000 acres of land, and has commenced its operations under very favourable auspices. The Western Reserve College has been located at Hudson, and a commodious edifice erected. The college at Cincinnati is also a flourishing institution. Besides these institutions, there are academies, well endowed, in the principal towns ofthe state, so that the means of education are as great as in any state of the west. Towns.\u2014 Columbus, the seat of government, is situated on the Scioto, in the central part of the state, 45 rndes north of"], [114, "108 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW Chillicothe. It w7as laid out in 1812, and contained in 1820 about 1,600 inhabitants. Cincinnati is the largest town in the Western States. It is pleasantly situated on the Ohio, 465 miles below Pittsburg, by water, 300 by land. It is a flourishing town, regularly laid out, and handsomely built of brick, and has a flourishing trade, and extensive manufactures. The population, in 1820, was 9,600. The other principal towns are Chillicothe, Steubenville. and Circleviile, which is remarkable for its sites, being built on two large, ancient forts, one circular, the other square ; Marietta, Dayton, New7 Lancaster, New Lisbon, St. Clairsville, Urban, Lebanon and Galliopolis ; and, on Lake Erie, Painsville, Cleveland, and Sandusky. Manufactures. \u2014 The amount invested in manufactures, in 1810, was $2,900,000, and the articles of manufacture consisted of linen, woollc-n, and cotton goods, leather, spirits, beer, iron, machinery, nails, &c. These establishments have very greatly increased in extent and value since that period. Banks. \u2014 There are over 30 chartered banks in Ohio, estab lished at Cincinnati, Chillicothe, Zanesville, and the other prin cipal towns throughout the state. Commerce. \u2014 The commerce of this state, and of the country generally, till within a few years, was carried on in flat-bottom ed boats, keel-boats and barges, but is at present carried on al most entirely by steamboats. Tbe exports consist of tobacco, flour, pork, pot and pearl ashes, cheese, soap and candles, and lumber. The imports of East India, European and New England goods, and of the manufactures of the Middle States, have hith erto been brought from Philadelphia and Baltimore. But the internal improvements of the country, which-are projected, will facilitate the means of transportation both by land and water, so that the commerce of this state will be yearly increased. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 Owing to the unsettled state of the country, the climate has been unfavourable to the health of the settlers ; but it is found that the undue proportion of moisture contained in the atmosphere diminishes as the country becomes cleared, and the w*oodlands cultivated ; and this circumstance justifies the conclusion, that, when the country becomes extensively opened, the atmosphere will be as dry as that of any part of the Union. By accurate observations, made at Cincinnati for a course of nine years, it was ascertained that the mean annual range of the thermometer was 100\u00b0. The amount of rain and snow which falls annually is about thirty-six inches. Face of the Country. \u2014 About one fourth of tho state of Ohio declines to the northern lakes, the other three fourths to the Ohio. The surface of the former is generally flat, and frequently marshy; that ofthe latter is rolling and uneven, and beautifully diversified with round-topped hill^, covered with a fertile soil, which bears a rich growth of wood. Prairies, or large tracts of land naturally destitute of wood, abound here, as in all the coun-"], [115, "OF OHIO. 109 ii tries west of the Alleghanies. In the northern parts of this state they occupy three fourths ofthe surface. Soil and Productions. \u2014 A large portion of the soil is very fer tile. The country watered by the Scioto and the Great and Little Miamies, is accounted the best. The average produce of farming land in the state, and in the basin of the Ohio generally, is forty bushels of maize per acre, twenty-two of wheat, twenty six of rye, thirty-five of oats, thirty of barley, and twelve to fif teen hundred weight of tobacco. Rivers. \u2014 The Ohio forms the southern boundary. The prin cipal rivers flowing into the Ohio in this state are the Musking um, Hockhocking, Scioto, and the Miamies. The largest that flow into Lake Erie are the Miami, Sandusky and Cayahoga. Springs. \u2014 The Yellow Spring, in Greene county, 64 miles from Cincinnati, and two from the Falls of Little Miami, is a copious river, bursting from a fissure in the silicious limestone rocks ; and is, at the distance of a few rods, precipitated into a ravine more than a hundred feet deep. On its passage thither it has deposited an immense bank of brownish ochre, of which an attempt has been made to prepare a paint, which has been attended with the most flattering success. The springs mostly resorted to, by the people of Cincinnati, are the Salines at Big Bone, 22 miles south-west of the town. There is said to be an oil spring, 42 feet deep, and 3 feet diameter, on Duck Creek, which yields an abundance of pure oil ofthe smell of British oil, which burns well in lamps. Botany. \u2014 The prevailing growth of timber, and the more use ful trees, are maple, or sugar tree, sycamore, black and white mulberry, black and white walnut, butternut, chestnut, &c. &c. There is a sycamore tree, near Marietta, measuring 60 feet in cir cumference, and, being hollow, will contain 18 or 20 men. The black walnut also attains ' to a very great size, and has been found to measure from seven to eight feet in circumference. Mineralogy. \u2014 Near the Yellow Spring have been found spe cimens of silver ore and iron ore ; coal and limestone are abun dant. There are also found valuable beds of white and blue clay, which are a source of great profit to the owners. Salt springs of very considerable value are found on the Scioto River, also near the Muskingum, and on the military tract, which are tbe property ofthe United States. Natural Curiosities.\u2014 The only natural curiosities of Ohio are the prairies, which are extended meadow lands of very great extent, covered with grass of most luxuriant growth. They af ford pastures for wild game and wdd cattle, which are taken with great dexterity and art. The remains of fortifications, and the remnants of the works of ancient population, are objects of curiosity, and excite the attention of every inquisitive traveUer. 10"], [116, "110 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW INDIANA. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent\u2014 This state lies between 37\u00b0 45' N. lat., and 41\u00b0 50' ; and between 84\u00b0 42' and 87\u00b0 49' W. lon. Its greatest length, from north to south, is 287 miles, and its breadth 155 miles, and it contains an area of 36,250 square miles. Boundaries. \u2014 The state is bounded north by Illinois, Lake Michigan and Michigan Territory, east by Ohio, south by Ken tucky, west by Illinois. Divisions. \u2014 Indiana is divided into forty-three counties. Religion. \u2014 The principal religious sects are Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists. They have few regular and settled ministers, but there is a prevailing disposition to receive mis sionaries. A new sect of religionists have recently sprung up in the eastern part ofthe state, who call themselves Harmonians. Population. \u2014 The population of Indiana, in 1800, was 5,641, and in 1820, 147,178. The white population is principally con fined to the southern part of the state. The Indians do not, probably, exceed 6,000 or 7,000. Character. \u2014 The population is made up of emigrants from the old states and Europe, who have brought the characters of those with whom they were originally associated. The settlement near Vevay is composed of Swiss, who emigrated to this country in 1805. They are a temperate, industrious people, and warmly attached to their new country. Literature. \u2014 In the act of congress admitting this state into the Union, one section in each township is appropriated to the support of schools, and one entire township was given for the use of a college. Towns. \u2014 The towns in Indiana are small, and all of them have been recently settled, except Vincenncs. Indianopolis is the seat of government, and was laid out in 1821. Vincennes, on the Wabash, is the oldest town, and a place of considerable trade. The other towns are Madison, Vevay, Corydon, Harmo ny and Princeton. Commerce. \u2014 The commerce of this country centres at Vin cennes. The merchants bring their goods from Canada down the Wabash, from Orleans up the Mississippi, and from the Eastern States down the Ohio, and up the Wabash. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Face of the Country. \u2014 Near the Ohio the country is hilly ; farther north, generally level, and abounding in extensive prai ries, some of which are dry, others wet and marshy. Soi7 and Productions. \u2014 The soil and productions are similar to those in Ohio and Illinois. Agriculture is well conducted, and its products are abundant. Wine is made in Vevay, on the Ohio. Rivers. \u2014 The Ohio forms the southern boundary. The other"], [117, "111 OF ILLINOIS. large river is the Wabash, which is navigable for boats 400 miles. Other rivers are the White River, White Water, Tip pecanoe, Illinois and St. Joseph's. Mineralogy. \u2014 There is a coal mine on White River, and coal mines are said to be numerous on the banks of the Wabash. Natural Curiosity. \u2014 In the southern part is the Indiana Cave, which is very extensive, comprising several apartments, variously decorated. It is remarkable for the great abundance of Epsom salts which it affords. ILLINOIS. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent. \u2014 This state lies between lat. 36\u00b0 57' and 42\u00b0 30' N., and between lon. 86\u00b0 and 91\u00b0 20' W. It is 390 miles long, from north to south, and, on an average, more than 150 broad. Boundaries. \u2014 North by the North-west Territory, east by Lake Michigan and Indiana, south-east by Kentucky, and west by the Mississippi. Divisions. \u2014 This state is divided into 26 counties. Name. \u2014 This state derives its name from the River Illinois, an Indian word signifying a man of full age, in the vigour of his years. Illinois River is the river of men. Population. \u2014 The population, in 1820, was 55,211. Government. \u2014 The constitution, which was adopted in 1818, in all its grand features, is very similar to the other states of the Union. The governor is chosen for four years. Literature. \u2014 A portion of every township is appropriated to the support of schools ; and provision has also been made for a college. Roads and Canals. \u2014 Two per cent, of the net proceeds of the United States' lands, lying within the state, are to be ex pended, under the direction of congress, in making roads lead ing to the state. A canal has been projected, to unite the head waters ofthe Illinois with Lake Michigan. Towns. \u2014 Vandalia is the seat of government, and is pleasantly situated on the Kaskaskia, 65 miles north-east of St. Louis. It was handsomely laid out in 1819, and is a flourishing place. Some of the other considerable towns are, Kaskaskia, on the river of the same name, 6 miles east of the Mississippi ; Cahokia and Alton, on the Mississippi ; Edwardsville, 20 miles north east of St. Louis ; Shawneetown, on the Ohio ; and Albion, a few miles from the Wabash. Manufactures and Commerce.\u2014 Manufactures scarcely exist, except a few products of domestic industry. Provisions and grain are exported. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Face of the Country. \u2014 Illinois has no mountains ; the face of the country is generally level, or moderately uneven. More than one half of the state consists of prairies."], [118, "112 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW7 Soil and Productions. \u2014 The soil is very fertile. Indian corn is one of the staple productions, and sometimes yields upwards of 100 bushels to an acre. The soil is well adapted to other kinds of grain, and hemp; flax, tobacco, &c. Rivers.\u2014 The Mississippi, Ohio and Wabash, form about two thirds of the whole of the boundary of the state. The Illinois is a fine river, lying chiefly within the state, and flowing into the Mississippi, 21 miles above the junction of the Missouri. It has a very gentle current, and is navigable to within a few miles of Lake Michigan. A canal, of a few miles in length, would open a water communication between the Mis sissippi and the great lakes. The other principal rivers are the Kaskaskias, Big Muddy, Little Wabash, Sanguemon and Rock River. Mineralogy. \u2014 Coal is found in great abundance ; also valuable mines of lead and iron. Salt springs occur in almost every county, and are of great value. The most important salt works are in the neighbourhood of Shawneetown. Natural Curiosities. \u2014 On the banks of the Ohio and Illinois are steep, high and picturesque cliffs, in which are found cav erns of different dimensions : the most remarkable of these is Cave in Rock, which is situated on the Ohio, 30 miles below the mouth of the Wabash, and was formerly a rendezvous of rob bers. In one ofthe head branches ofthe Illinois there is a singular fossil, or petrified tree, lying in a horizontal position. It is 24 feet in diameter, and the part of the trunk now visible is 51 feet long. MISSOURI. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent\u2014 It extends from 36\u00b0 to about 40\u00b0 30' N. lat., and from 89\u00b0 to 94\u00b0 10' W. lon. Boundaries. \u2014 Missouri is bounded east by Mississippi River, which separates it from Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee ; south by Arkansas Territory ; west and north by Missouri Territory. Divisions. \u2014 The state is divided into 15 counties. Population. \u2014 Its population, in 1820, was 66,586, including 10,222 slaves. Towns. \u2014 Jefferson, a new town, on the Missouri, a few miles above the mouth of the Osage, was laid out in 1822, and made the seat of government. St. Louis, on the Mississippi, 18 miles below the junction of the Missouri, is much the largest town. It is a flourishing place, admirably situated for trade, near the junction of the three great rivers, the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois. Population, 4600. The other principal towns are, St. Charles, on the Missouri, 18 mUes north-west of St. Louis ; Franklin, on the Missouri, 175 miles west of St. Louis ; St. Genevieve and Herculaneum, on the"], [119, "OF MICHIGAN TERRITORY. 113 Mississippi, the principal depots of the lead mines ; and Potosi and St. Michael, the chief towns in the mining district. Education. \u2014 A portion of the land in every township is appro priated to the support of schools, and provision has been made for endowing a college. Manufactures. \u2014 The only manufactures, except domestic, are those of lead. Commerce. \u2014 This state carries on a considerable trade, chief ly with New York, Philadelphia and Pittsburg, in the produce of its mines, the cattle of its prairies, and the furs of western regions. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Face of the Countnj. \u2014 The face of the country is greatly di versified with plains, forests, prairies and barren and rocky hills. The lands bordering on the rivers are low, and subject to inun dations. In the south-east part are the Ozark Mountains, some peaks of which are about 3000 feet high. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The land on the rivers is generally very rich ; at a distance from them, much of it is poor. The productions are similar to those of Illinois. Rivers. \u2014 The Mississippi forms the eastern boundary ; the Missouri flows through the state ; and the Osage is a large, navigable river, flowing into the Missouri. The other prin cipal rivers are the Charaton, Grand, Salt, Meramec and St. Francis. Mineralogy. \u2014 The famous lead mines of the Missouri lie about 40 miles to the west of the Mississippi. They are among the richest and most extensive in the world. The mine district contains upwards of 3000 square miles. The soil is poor, and the surface rolling, like a body of water in gentle agitation. There are 45 mines, which employ 1100 persons, and yield an nually 3 or 4,000,000 pounds of lead. Rich iron ore, in vast quantities, is found in the state. Antiquities. \u2014 Several skeletons were discovered, in the fall of 1813, on the banks of the River Meramec, which indicate a stature unusually small, and are supposed by many to be the remains of an extinct race of human beings, of dwarfish origin, who inhabited the country at a former period. MICHIGAN TERRITORY. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent\u2014 The territory extends from 41\u00b0 31' to 46\u00b0 39' N. lat., and from 82\u00b0 to about 86\u00b0 W. lon. It is 350 miles long, from north to south, and 212 broad, on the southern boundary. Boundaries.\u2014 Michigan Territory is bounded north by Lake Superior ; east by Lakes Huron, S\"t. Clair and Erie ; south by Ohio and Indiana ; and west by the North-west Territory. Divisions. \u2014 The territory was divided, in 1820, into 7 counties. 10*"], [120, "114 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW7 Population. \u2014 The population, exclusive of Indians, in ISlOy was 4762, and in 1820, 8896 ; none of these were slaves. Indians. \u2014 The number of Indians in this territory is estimated at between 9 and 10,000. The two principal tribes are the Chippewas and Ottawas. Government. \u2014 The legislative power is vested in a governor, and a supreme court, composed of three judges ; all appointed by the president ofthe United States. Religion. \u2014 The greater part of the inhabitants w7ere, till late- ly, Catholics, descendants ofthe French traders, and were sunk in a state of deplorable ignorance and wickedness. Lately the state of religion and morals has been rising. Literature. \u2014 A corporate body, styled \" The University of Michigan,\" has been formed, similar to that which exists in New York and Georgia. This body has power to institute col- leges, academies and primary schools. Towns. \u2014 Detroit, the chief town, is delightfully situated on the west bank of Detroit River, 9 miles from Lake St. Clair, and has considerable trade in furs and peltry. Population, 1422. Michillimackinac, pronounced Mackinaw, is an island in the straits of the same name, 300 miles north-north-west of Detroit, and contains upwards of 100 houses. St. Mary's village is at the foot ofthe rapids in St. Mary's River. Bank. \u2014 A bank has been established at Detroit, which is in operation. Manufactures. \u2014 The manufactures in this territory, in 1810, were estimated at 50,000 dollars. Commerce. \u2014 This territory is finely situated for commerce, being almost surrounded by navigable waters, which will soon be connected by canals with the Hudson on the one hand, and the Mississippi on the other. The vessels which navigate the lakes are from 10 to 60 tons. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Climate. \u2014 The climate is healthful, and much milder than that of the Atlantic States in the same latitude ; but upon the coast of Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair, it is more severe. Face ofthe Country. \u2014 There are no mountains. The country is generally level, or moderately uneven ; in the central parts somewhat elevated, but level and marshy ; descending in all directions towards the waters. Soil. \u2014 A great part of the country has an extremely fertile soil ; but that part bordering on Lake Michigan is generally sandy and barren. Rivers. \u2014 The rivers within this territory are numerous, but small. Some of the principal ones are the Raisin, Huron, St. Joseph's and Grand Rivers. They abound in white fish, and the fisheries are valuable. Lakes. \u2014 Lake Michigan lies wholly within this territory. It is 260 miles long, and 55 broad. Lake Huron lies partly in this territory, and partly in Upper Canada. Lake St. Clair,"], [121, "115 OF THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORY. lying between Lake Huron and Lake Erie, is about 90 miles in circumference. Islands. \u2014 Grand Isle is near the southern coast of Lake Su perior, more than 100 miles from the eastern extremity of the lake. The St. Martin's Islands lie about 10 miles north-east of Michillimackinac. NORTH-WEST TERRITORY. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent\u2014 It extends from 42\u00b0 30' to 49\u00b0 N. latitude, and from 84\u00b0 to 98\u00b0 W. longitude. Its greatest length, from south-east to north-west, is 700 miles ; its greatest breadth, 550. Boundaries. \u2014 This territory is bounded north by the bounda ry line between the United States and the British possessions ; east by Michigan Territory ; south by the state of Illinois ; west by the Mississippi. Population.- -It has a few white inhabitants, who are subject to the government of Michigan. Indians. \u2014 The principal tribes of Indians in this territory are the Chippeways, Winnebagoes, and the Menomonies. The w-hole number of Indians in the North-west Territory is esti mated at 18,000. Settlements. \u2014 Prairie du Chien is a settlement on the Missis sippi, 3 miles above the mouth of the Ouisconsin. There is an other settlement at the head of Green Bay. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Face of the Country. \u2014 The northern part, bordering on Lake Superior, is wild, rough, sometimes mountainous, and generally barren ; but most of the country is but moderately uneven, and a great part of it consists of prairies. Soil. \u2014 There are excellent alluvial tracts on many ofthe rivers, and much of the upland has a good soil. Rivers. \u2014 The Mississippi bounds this country on the west. The other chief rivers are the Ouisconsin, Fox, Menomonie, Chippeway, Coppermine, Rocky, Montreal, St. Louis, and St. Croix. Lakes and Bays.\u2014 Lake Superior, the largest lake in North America, lies on the boundary line between the United States and the British possessions. The principal bays are Fond du Lac, on the western extremity of the lake ; Chegoimegon Bay, and Keweena Bay. Sandy Lake is a small lake, about 12 miles in circumference, in the western part ofthe territory. Copper Mines.\u2014 The southern coast of Lake Superior yields iron, lead, and various other metals, but particularly copper. On the banks of the Ontonagon, large masses of this mei al are found in a pure state."], [122, "116 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW ARKANSAS TERRITORY Situation. \u2014 Arkansas Territory is bounded north by Missouri Territory and state ; east by Mississippi ; south by Louisiana, and by Red River, which separates it from the Spanish domin ions ; and west by the Spanish dominions. Divisions. \u2014 The territory is divided into 9 counties. Population. \u2014 This territory contained 14,273 inhabitants in 1820, of whom 1,617 were slaves. Indians. \u2014 The principal tribes are the Cherokees and the Osages. Ofthe latter there are about 2,000, who inhabit seve ral villages, and branches ofthe Arkansas River. Face ofthe Country. \u2014 Its eastern part is flat, and contains the great swamp, which receives the surplus waters of the Missis sippi; the western part is uneven, but very bare of wood; the middle is occupied by the broad and low chain of the Ozark Mountains. Prairies are very common, and some of them of great extent. Soil. \u2014 In the eastern part there are rich alluvial tracts ; the western parts are dry and fertile. Towns. \u2014 A country so recently settled can have no consider able towns. The village of Arkopolis, formerly called Little Rock, on Arkansas River, about 140 miles fiom its mouth, is the seat of government. The settlement was commenced in 1820. The post of Arkansas was established by the French, more than a century age' on Arkansas River, 65 miles from its mouth. Dwight is a missionary station among the Cherokees, near the Arkansas, about 400 miles by the stream above its mouth. Rivers. \u2014 The Arkansas rises from the Rocky Mountains, and flows through the whole extent of this country. It is navigable for boats, at some seasons, nearly 2,000 miles. The Mississippi and Red River form a part of the boundary. The other princi pal rivers are White, St. Francis, and Wachita. Hot Springs. \u2014 The Hot Springs, about 150 miles north-west of Arkansas, are about 70 in number, and much visited by invalids, and are useful in various complaints. The water is limpid and colourless, and so hot, at some seasons, as to boil eggs in a few minutes. The steam rising from the springs is condensed into a white vapour, which is often visible at a great distance. There are several salt springs ; and about 1,300 miles up the Arkansas is a tract of several miles in extent, called the salt prairie, which is covered, to the depth of 4 or 6 inches, with pure white salt. MISSOURI TERRITORY. Ertent and Situation.\u2014 Missouri Territory is bounded north by the British dominions ; east by the North-west Territory and the states of Illinois and Missouri ; south by Arkansas Territory ;"], [123, "OF MISSOURI TERRITORY. 117 south-west by the Spanish dominions ; and west by the Rocky Mountains. Face of the Country and Soil. \u2014 The Missouri Territory com prehends the vast region situated on both sides of that river, be tween the state of Missouri and the Rocky Mountains. Of this territory, the eastern parts are level, moderately uneven, or hilly ; towards the west the country becomes elevated and mountainous. The soil in the eastern and southern parts is generally fertile, and also on the margin ofthe rivers. In the central and western parts, except on the border ofthe rivers, the country is, for the most part, destitute of timber and vegetation. It is a vast, elevated, barren waste. Rivers. \u2014 The Missouri pursues a circuitous route through the heart of the territory. The three largest branches of the Mis souri are the Yellow Stone, the Platte and the Kansas. Mountains. \u2014 The Rocky Mountains, the most elevated range within the territory of the United States, rise abruptly on the eastern side, from a plain which is supposed to be elevated about 3,000 feet above the sea. They consist of ridges and peaks, the highest of which are covered with perpetual snow, and rise from 4,000 to 8,000 feet above their base, or from 7,000 to 11,000 feet above the sea. They are rugged and broken, and, though gen erally rather barren, they exhibit a scattering growth of scrab by pines, oak, cedar and furze, and enclose some fertile valleys. Animals. \u2014 Buffaloes and other wild animals wander, in im mense herds, over almost every part of the territory ; but par ticularly on the banks of the Missouri and Arkansas, which are regarded as the paradise of hunters. Buffaloes are sometimes seen in herds, supposed to amount to 10,000. Indians. \u2014 This territory is inhabited, except at a few military posts, exclusively by Indians. The tribes best known to us are the Sioux, Osages, and Fox Indians. The Sioux are the most powerful tribe in North America. They are brave, spirited and generous, with proud notions of their origin, and of their supe riority as hunters and warriors. Their number has been esti mated at 22,000. The Osages live principally in this territory, but partly in Arkansas. Their whole number has been esti mated at about 6,000. The Fox Indians are a small but warlike tribe, on both sides of the Mississippi, between the Ouisconsin and Rock Rivers. The whole number of the various tribes of Indians has been estimated at 150,000. The United States have military posts at Council Bluffs and St. Peter's River. Curiosities.\u2014 The Great Falls ofthe Missouri are 2,570 miles, by the river, above its junction with the Mississippi. They consist of a succession of cataracts and rapids, and present scenes of great beauty and grandeur. The largest cataract is 87 feet perpendicular, and the whole descent ofthe river is up wards of 350 feet. The place where the river makes its escape from the moun-. tains, called the Gates of the Rocky Mountains, is a scene of"], [124, "118 GEOGRAPHICAL VIEW singular grandeur. For a distance of more than 5 miles, the rocks rise perpendicularly from the water's edge nearly 1,200 feet. The river is compressed to the width of 150 yards, and for three miles there is but one spot on which a man can stand between the water and the perpendicular ascent ofthe mountain bank. On the Missouri, about 100 miles below the Great Falls, there are natural stone walls, rising in some places to the height of nearly \u00a300 feet. They are almost perpendicular, exhibiting a great variety of forms, sometimes resembling different kinds of ruins, and often so regular as to seem the work of art. Near the foot ofthe Rocky Mountains are seen lofty eminen ces, rising with perpendicular sides, and level, table-like summits. One of these singular hills is called Castle Rock, and has columns, porticoes, and arches ; and, when seen at a distance, it exhibits an astonishingly regular and artificial appearance. FLORIDA. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY. Extent and Situation. \u2014 This territory of the United States is 400 miles long, from Cape Sable to St. Mary's River, and 340 broad, from the Atlantic to the Perdido River, which separates it from Alabama. It lies between lat. 25\u00b0 and 31\u00b0 N., and lon. 80\u00b0 30' and 87\u00b0 15' W. Boundaries. \u2014 Bounded north by Alabama and Georgia ; west by Alabama and the Gulf of Mexico ; south and east by the Atlantic. Divisions and Government. \u2014 While the Floridas belonged to Spain, they w-ere divided into two provinces, East and -West Florida, each of which had its own government. Since the cession of it to the United States, \"all the military, civil, and judicial powers, exercised by the Spanish officers before the cession, are vested, by act of congress, in such person or persons, and to be exercised in such manner as the president of the United States shall direct, for the maintaining the inhabitants of said territory in the free enjoyment of their liberty, religion and property ; and the laws of the United States, relative to the collection of the revenue, and the importation of persons of colour, shall be extended to said territory.\" Name. \u2014 Juan Ponce de Leon gave the country the name of Florida, \"because,\" says Purchas, \"it was discovered on Palm Sunday, or Easter day, which the Spaniards callPasf/ua Florida.\" Religion. \u2014 The prevalent form of the Christian religion is Roman Catholic. Population. \u2014 The population of Florida was estimated, in 1820, at 10,000, exclusive of Indians. Towns. \u2014 The most considerable places are St. Augustine on the east, coast, which had 3,000 inhabitants, and Pensacola on the west, which had 2,000, both chiefly of Spanish origin. Tallahassee, a new town, is now the capital,"], [125, "OF THE WESTERN TERRITORY. 119 Commerce\u2014 The trade of the eastern part of Florida centres in St. Augustine, that of the western part in Pensacola, which is the best port in the Mexican Gulf. NATURAL GEOGRAPHY. Face ofthe Country. \u2014 Florida is a flat country, interspersed with swamps, some of which are extensive. A ridge of lime stone runs through the middle of the peninsula, and\" there is a little upland near the northern boundary. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The soil is in general barren and sandy, but on the rivers it is extremely fertile, and adapted to the culture of rice and corn ; while cotton, coffee and sugar may be raised on the other soils in abundance. The live oak, much valued for timber, abounds in this country. The mag nolias, which have already been described, are uncommonly striking objects. Rivers. \u2014 The Perdido forms the western boundary. The Appalachicola is formed by the union of the Flint and Chata houchee Rivers, at the south-west extremity of Georgia. The St. John's is the principal river of Florida. Its whole length is about 300 miles, and it is navigable about 150. Bays. \u2014 Pensacola Bay, at the mouths of Escambia and Al mirante Rivers, is 15 miles long, and from 3 to 7 broad. This bay is a great acquisition to the United States. Islands. \u2014 St. Rose's Island is every where narrow, and reaches from Pensacola Bay to St. Rose's Bay, about 45 miles. St. George's Islands are 6 leagues long, and of considerable breadth. WESTERN TERRITORY. The Western Territory includes the country watered by the Columbia and its branches ; and is but little known. The tract along the Rocky Mountains is a high, level plain, in all parts fertile, and in many covered with a growth of long-leaved pine. The rest of the country is nearly of the same description ; but the soil, in the district nearest the coast, is subject to excessive rains. The climate is severe in the mountainous parts, but milder near the shores of the Pacific. A fallen fir tree, in the Columbia valley, was sound by Lewis and Clark to be 318 feet in length, though its diameter was only 3 feet. The Columbia is navigable for sloops, as high as the tide water reaches, 183 miles. At the mouth of the river, the United States have established a colony, which will probably soon be connected with the settlements on the Missouri, by a line of military posts. The Indian tribes, which are numerous in the Western Terri tory, have been supposed to include a population of 80,000 souls."], [126, "INDEX. fase. Page.
