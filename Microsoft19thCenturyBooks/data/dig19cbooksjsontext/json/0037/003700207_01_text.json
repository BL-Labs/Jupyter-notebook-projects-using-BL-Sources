In presenting to the public a new History of Scotland, fitted for the instruction of the young, a few words may be necessary to explain the circumstances under which it appears.

The greater part of this volume accordingly consists of that article, with some slight additions, chiefly abridged from the larger Work of the same author. Besides the simple narrative of events, it appeared de sirable to give such an outline of the progress of society, as would impart to the reader just views of the social advancement of the nation at the several epochs of its his tory.

Our first authentic knowledge of Britain is derived from Julius r C\u00e6sar. Fifty-five years before the Christian era, this ex- I ' ' traordinary man invaded the island from Gaul. But his I \u2014 I operations were attended with little success, his stay was brief, and he knew nothing of Scotland. It was not till nearlv a century and a-half after C\u00e6sar's invasion, that Julius Agricola, dur ing the reign of the Emperor Vespasian, penetrated, at the head of A"], [16, "2 [A. D. 121. HISTOKT OF SCOTLAND. a Roman army, into the northern parts of Britain. The details of his various campaigns, the resistance which he encountered, and the vestiges of his progress which yet remain, have furnished mat- ter of laborious investigation to antiquaries. Among their conflict- ing accounts, it seems certain that he first pushed his conquests as far as the Friths of Forth and Clyde ; that in succeeding campaigns he penetrated northwards ; and that in his last great expedition, he was opposed by a barbarian chief named Galgacus. A sangui- nary battle was fought between this leader and Agricola, the exact site of which has been keenly disputed ; but there seems to be little doubt, that, previously to its occurrence, the Roman general had passed the Frith of Tay, and, although victorious over the fierce and undisciplined multitudes which opp osed him, that he experi- enced a check which compelled him to desist from any further ag- gression. Two great events marked the last years of the govern- ment of Agricola. With his fleet he explored the northern coasts of Scotland ; and to him the Roman world, in all probability, owed its first certain knowledge that Britain was an island. He also en- deavoured to secure his conquests from future attack by a chain of I . j. I forts connecting the Friths of Forth and Clyde. Having ' ' completed these defences, he was recalled by the Emperor ' '\u25a0 \u2014 Domitian, and left Britain in the year 85. 2. From this time till the reign of Hadrian, a period of thirty- ~ 7 TT~ six years, we hear little of the Romans, either in southern ' ' or northern Britain. Early in the second century, this em- \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 peror in person made an expedition into Scotland ; aud about twenty years later, Lollius Urbicus, the Roman governor un- der the Emperor Antoninus, distinguished himself by the corn-age and ability which he displayed against the turbulent aud warlike tribes of the northern parts of the island. Two facts may be men- tioned, which demonstrate how uncertain was the tenure by which the Romans held their northern possessions in Britain. The Em pero>- Hadrian, apparently distrusting the sufficiency of the line of forts formed by Agricola, constructed a wall or fortified rampart from the Tyue to the Solway ; and between the period of Hadrian's death and the succession of Antoninus Pius (a. d. 138), these forts between the Forth and Clyde had been so completely destroyed, that Lollius Urbicus found it necessary to rebuild them, and con nect them by another wall or rampart. Diuing the remaining years of his government the latter able officer devoted himself to the opening up of the country by roads ; to the construction of various camps and fcrtalices ; and to the introduction of those useful arts which were best calculated to elevate and humanize the character oi the northern barbarians. His administration in Britain appears"], [17, "A. D. 211.] 3 ROMAN PEKIOD. to have terminated with the death of his master, Antoninus Pius, a. d. 161. 3. From this period till the beginning of the third century, no- | j) thing is known of the history of Britain. But in the year \u201e\u201e_ ' 207, the Emperor Severus received intelhgence that the \u2014 ' Caledonians had invaded the Roman provinces, and with the greatest vigour and alacrity hastened in person to reduce the insurgents. In the comparatively civilized country between the walls of Hadrian and Antoninus, he met with little opposition ; but when he left the latter line of defence, and conducted his army into the wild regions beyond the Frith of Forth, he encountered very formidable obstacles. The savage and uncleared state of the coun- try, the extent of the forests, the unhealthy and interminable marshes, the mountainous ranges, the rivers, of which the fords were unknown, and the want of any other subsistence for his troops than what he earned along with him, presented the most serious difficulties to the march of a regular army. By cutting down the forests, however, draining the marshes, opening up the country by roads, and constructing bridges, he proceeded so far north, that the soldiers remarked the extraordinar}- length of the days and BuOrtnees of the nights, in comparison with those of Italy. There seems good reason to believe that the spot where the Roman eagles terminated their flight in this memorable expedition, was the promontory which separates the Cromarty and the Moray Friths. Here the Caledo- nians sought for peace, surrendered their arms, and relinquished a portion of their country. 4. Severus retired to York hi a feeble state of health ; but it . n was not to repose upon his laurels ; for scarcely had he ' * reached that station, when news arrived that the Caledo- \u2014 \u2014 '\u25a0 \u2014 nians were again in arms. Irritated by disappointment and disease, he determined instantly to renew the war, entrusted the command of the army to his son Caracalla, and issued orders to spare neither age nor sex. But death happily arrested these inhu- man projects. The emperor expired at York ; and his son does not appear to have executed his orders. 5. Previously to his celebrated northern campaign, Severus is said to have reconstructed the rampart originally built by Hadrian between the Tyne and the Solway ; a circumstance from which there arises a strong presumption that the Caledonians had encroached upon the Roman provinces, and regained much of the intermediate country between the walls of Hadrian and Antoninus. 6. From this period (a. d. 211), till nearly the middle of the fifth century (a. d. 446), the Romans appear to have abandoned all thoughts of extending their conquests. The vast fabric of their em-"], [18, "[A. D. 440 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 4 pire was now in a state of melancholy feebleness and decay, being attacked on every side by those fierce tribes who were destined to destroy it, and unable to retain provinces both nearer and more im portant than those in Britain. For some time, however, an effort was made to defend the northern Romanized Britons from the repeated in- I . _ cursions of the Caledonians. In the commencement of the I ' ' fourth century, (a. d. 306), Constans revisited Britain for this purpose : in the year 368, after a sanguinary and de- structive invasion by the barbarians, a temporary tranquil ' \u2014 lity was restored by the arms of Theodosius : in 398, Sti licho, alarmed by new excesses and increasing weakness in the north ern provinces, sent such effectual aid as enabled the Roman gover nors once more to repel the enemy : and, lastly, in the year 422, the Emperor Honorius, having in vain endeavoured to rouse the provincial inhabitants to a vigorous effort in then- own defence, sent a legion to their assistance, by whose efforts the fortifications of the two walls were repaired, and the barbarians once more driven back into their more northern seats. But this was the last relief which could be wrung by her miserable slaves from a mistress who was herself expiring ; and it secured for them but a brief period of tran quillity. Imperial Rome, with a tardy and ostentatious justice, con ferred freedom on the southern Britons ; and relinquishing a coun try which she was no longer able to hold, informed them that hence forth they must trust to their own efforts for the defence of their in dependence. Having given this parting information to men who appear to have been little able to act upon it, the Romans aban doned Britain for ever. (A. D. 446.)"], [19, "( o ) CHAPTER IX A. D. 446 to 843.

In the brief sketch which has been given of the Roman domi- nion in north Britain, we have seen that the Romanized Britons were constantly exposed to the invasions of their more northern neighbours, who threatened at last to wrest from them the whole of the country which had been fortified by Roman skill, and mainly defended by Roman soldiers. At the epoch of Agricola's invasion, the whole extent of north Britain was inhabited by a number of tribes, who were connected by such slight ties that they can scarcely be said to have enjoyed a social state. Of the manners of these tribes, it is impossible, in the absence of all authentic documents, to speak with certainty; but from the general account given by C\u00e6sar, it may be inferred that they were little removed, in the scale of social life or of civil government, from the rudest savages. They led a pastoral life, living on the milk of their flocks, or the produce of the chase ; they were addicted to polygamy and idolatry ; their religion, which was Druidical, was stained with human sacrifices ; and their rude form of civil government was intimately connected with their religion. They were aimed with slight shields, short spears, and daggers, and sometimes fought in small cars, drawn by little spirited horses. They rather bun-owed in huts than lived in houses, went naked from choice, were brave to excess, capable of"], [20, "[A. D. 446. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 6 enduring all sorts of privations and fatigue, and had very loose ideas of property ; a character and mode of life which, with the exception of their Druidical form of worship, exhibit little more than the gene ral features of every savage people. There seems no reason to be lieve that the lapse of three centuries created any change in such of these fierce and indomitable tribes as, occupying the more northern parts of the island from the Forth to Caithness, were never brought under the yoke of the Romans, or humanized by the arts of that great people. 2. At the period of the Roman abdication, the parts of the island i . _ just mentioned were inhabited by those Caledonian clans, who, under the name of Picts or Picti, became for four '_ centuries the predominant nation in Scotland. The Ro manized tribes who possessed Valentia, or the countiy between the walls of Agricola and Antoninus, had made some progress in civi lisation ; but their fiercer brethren beyond the Forth still bore fresh upon them the stamp of barbarian life. The name of Picti is con jectured to be derived from Peithi, a British word which signifies those that are without, or the people of the open countiy. 3. It would be vain and idle labour to enter minutely upon the obscure and sanguinary annals of the Pictish period ; but some points which have been ascertained are not unworthy of notice. On the entire abdication of Britain by the Romans, the tribes which in habited Valentia were declared independent. They were no longer provincial subjects of Rome, but a free though an effeminate people. The constant attacks of the Picts rendered it necessary for them to unite in their own defence ; and from this union arose a new king dom, denominated by ancient authors sometimes the Regnum Cum brense, or more frequently the kingdom of Strathclyd. It appears to have included the present Liddesdale, Teviotdale, Dumfriesshire, Galloway, Ayrshire, Renfrew, Clydesdale, the midland and west ern parts of Stirlingshire, and the largest portion of Dumbarton shire. The metropolis of this kingdon was Alclyd, which is situat ed on the north bank of the Clyde, at the influx of the Leven. The descriptive name of Alclyd, which signifies the rocky height on the Clyde, was applied to the bifurcated rock, on the summit of which these associated Britons had built a strong hill-fort, which formed a secure residence for their reguli or kings. To this fortress the Scoto-Irish subsequently applied the name of Z\u00bb\u00ab\u00ab-Briton, signifying the fortress of the Britons, an appellation which, by an easy transi tion, has in modern times been converted into Dumbarton. Among the petty kings who reigned over Strathclyd, there are none whose names or exploits are worthy of preservation, with the single ex ception of the semi-poetic Arthur. At the commencement of the"], [21, "A. D. 547.] 7 riCTISH TEKIOI). sixth century, he was the chief military leader or Pendragon of the Cumbrian Britons ; and having expelled his sovereign, Huail or Hoel, from Strathclyd, he commenced a reign of wbich it is im possible to separate the facts from the fictions with which they have become incorporated. 4. But the Pictisb period is not only distinguished by the rise of a new kingdom : it is- also marked by the arrival in Scotland of a new people, the Saxons, a race of Gothic origin, who invaded and finally effected a settlement in Lothian. This remarkable event, ~T~ pT- so important in its remote consequences upon our national ' ' history, took place in the middle of the fifth century. At __^_1_ first the invaders appear not to have attempted the subju gation of the whole countiy, but to have contented themselves with the occupation of a portion of the province of Valentia. After the lapse of a century, however, Ida, one of the boldest and most adven- . \u201e I turous of the sons of Woden, landed at Flamborough, and ' \" I brought an important accession to the strength and uum- I bers of his countrymen. It was by this great chief that the Saxon kingdom of Xorthumbria was founded ; nor was he ar rested iu his victorious career, till he had extended his dominions from the Humber to the Forth. Ida was succeeded in the Northum brian kingdom by \u00c6Ua, and \u00c6lla by Ethelred, under whose reigns occurred no event of importance. But Edwin, the successor of Ethelred, who came to the throne hi the beginning of the seventh century, appeal's to have added considerably to the extent of the Saxon conquests, and to have impressed not only the southern Bri tons, but his fiercer and more northern neighbours the Picts, with the terror of his arms. There appears little doubt that Edinburgh or Edwinsburgh, the present capital of Scotland, owes its founda tion to this energetic Saxon chief. 5. Hitherto, in speaking of the northern inhabitants beyond the Forth, we have designated them by the single appellation of the Picts. We must now notice the arrival of another people, probablv sprung from the same ancient stock. 6. At the commencement of the fourth century, we find that the ruling or dominant people in Ireland were the Scots, a Celtic race. Although there is no sufficient evidence that they had formed any permanent settlement in Britain previously to the abdication of the \u25a0 ~ island by the Romans, it is certain that in the year 860 j they invaded the Roman provinces in that kingdom, and 1 d4'- ,vere repelled by Theodosius. In the beginning of the sixth centuiy, three Irish chiefs, Loarn, Fergus, and Angus, sons of Eric, king of Dalriada, by which we are to understand the province of Ulster, led a colony into the ancient province of the British Epi-"], [22, "8 [A. D. 568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. dii, and effected a settlement in the promontoiy of Kentire. As far as any light is afforded by the Irish annals, in this occupation of Kentire the Scoto-Irish met with but feeble opposition. A long period of obscurity succeeds, in which little more is distinguishable than the fact that a series of Scoto-Lish kings, or reguli, are found in Scotland, from the commencement of the sixth century (503), when Fergus held the throne, till the accession of Kenneth, the son of Alpin, who reigned from the year 836 to 843, and under whom the ascendancy of the Scoto-Lish or Scotch appears to have been established. 7. This period is distinguished by one great event which shines brightly amidst the surrounding gloom, namely, the conversion of northern Britain to Christianity. Already the Romanized Britons of the south had received the true faith, and the Scoto-Irish appear to have been converted to Christianity by St Patrick, previously to their establishment in Kentire. St Ninian, himself a Briton, though educated as a monk at Rome, had, in the commencement of the fourth century, founded a monasteiy in Galloway ; and in the sixth century, St Kentigern signalized himself by his pious labours among the Britons of Strathclyd ; but the conversion of the northern Picts was reserved for St Columba. This great and good man was born in Ireland, in the year 521. His descent was royal, and his educa tion was at first carefully conducted under the best masters which his native island, long before this time converted to Christianity, could supply. Of these the most noted was St Ciaran, the apostle of the Scoto-Lish of Kentire ; and from him, in all probability, Co lumba imbibed his first desire to introduce the gospel into the de j 7 y. solate and barbarous dominions of the northern Picts. It ' ' was in the year 568, that, embarking with twelve of his I !_ friends, in a boat of wicker- work, which was covered with hides, he set out upon his benevolent mission, and landed in the island of Hy, or Iona, which was situated near the confines of the Scottish and Pictish territories. The difficulties which he had to encounter on his first arrival, were of the most formidable kind. He found a people so barbarous that his fife was attempted ; the king, when the holy man first approached his residence, ordered its gates to be shut against him ; the priests, who were Druids, and possessed much influence, employed all their eloquence to counteract his ef forts ; and the nature of the country, woody, mountainous, and in fested with wild beasts, rendered travelling most dangerous and painful. It is also said, that at first the saint required an interpre ter to make himself intelligible, although, after a short residence, he appears to have found little difficulty in conversing with the bar barians. But none of these obstacles was sufficient to baffle the"], [23, "A. D. 826.] PICTISH PERIOD. 9 zeal and courage of Cohvmba ; and so blest were his labours, so ra pid the effects produced by the example of his virtues, that in a fen years the greater portion of the Pictish dominions was converted to the Christian faith. Churches were erected, and monasteries esta blished, in various places ; and Columba became an object of the utmost love and veneration among the barbarous tribes and fierce and warlike princes whom he had called from darkness into light. At that time his monastery was one of the chief seminaries of learning in Europe. It was the nursery which not only supplied all the monasteries, and above three hundred churches which he himself had established, with learned pastors, but which also gave divines to many of the religious establishments among the neigh- , p. I bouring nations. Columba died in the year 597, in the seventy-seventh year of his age ; a man not less distin- guished by zeal and labour in the dissemination of the gos pel, than by simplicity of manners, sweetness of temper, and holi ness of life. 8. Among the dark and uninteresting annals of this period, an other remarkable event must not escape our notice ; we mean the disappearance of the Pictish people after the middle of the ninth century. There seems every reason to believe, that the stoiy of the total extermination of the Picts by the sword of the victorious Kenneth Macalpin, is a fable invented at a later period : it is cer tainly supported by nothing approaching to contemporary evidence. .V more rational and intelligible account ascribes then: disappear ance, not to their destruction, but to what may more correctly be denominated their absorption by the predominating nation of the Scots. Both nations were probably of the same race, they spoke a similar language, and they differed little in their manners and civil government. Both were animated by the emulation of out stripping each other in power and extent of territory ; and this led to protracted struggles, in which the Picts maintained their inde pendence with difficulty, and the Scots, gradually enlarging their dominions, acquired a predominating influence. Such being the relative condition of the two nations, an event took place which united in one person the claim to the Pictish and the Scottish thrones. 9. Achaius, or Eocha, king of the Scots, who died in the year 826, had married Urgusia, a Pictish princess, the sister of Constan- 1 tine and Ungns, successively kings of the Picts. His grandson was Kenneth Macalpin, a prince of great hardi- 82b\"- hood an(] ambition, who succeeded to his paternal throne in 836. On the death of Uven, the Pictish monarch, in 839, Kenneth asserted his claim to the Pictish throne, in right of his grandmother,"], [24, "10 [A. D. 843. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Urgnsia. Tie feeble state of the nation, and the incapacity of the true heir, combined to favour his ambitious designs ; and, after a struggle of three years, he succeeded in uniting the two crowns in his own person. But though the king was changed, the govern ment remained the same ; and the two nations, being of congenial habits, springing from a common origin, and speaking cognate tongues, readily coalesced.

The union of the Picts and Scots under one powerful prince forms the commencement of the third great division of Scottish his tory, which extends from the middle of the ninth (843) to the close of the eleventh (1097) century. For ages before the time of this union, the Pictish dominions were bounded on the south bv the"], [25, "A. D. 904.] SCOTTISH PERIOD. 11 Forth, on the east and north by the German Ocean, and on the west by Drumalban, the range of mountains which separates the rivers flowing eastward from those flowing westward ; while, at the pe riod of its occurrence, the Scots possessed the whole western coast, from the Clyde on the south to Loch Eh- and Loch Maree on the north. 'These extensive dominions were now united ; the name of Scotia, as marking the whole kingdom, gained ground over that of Pictavia ; and from the middle of the tenth century, Scot/and, as the distinctive appellation for the kingdom of North Britain, gra dually excluded every other. 2. It has been observed by Sir Walter Scott, \" that the descend ants of Kenneth Macalpin pass us in gloomy and obscure pageantry, like those of Banquo in the theatre ;\" and it might have been add ed, that the impression left upon the mind by the perusal of their various reigns is as shadowy and unsubstantial. Instead, therefore. of fatiguing and perplexing the reader by a detail of occurrences which led to no great results, we shall only mark the features which prominently distinguish the period. 3. The first event which demands our notice, is the commence ment of those invasions by the Danes, which for several centuries continued to be the greatest scourge of Scotland. It was under the reign of Constantine, the second monarch in succession from Ken neth, that these fierce pirate leaders, known under the name of Vikinghr, or sea-kings, first made their appearance iu North Britain. Having established a settlement in Ireland, they soon became ac quainted with the commodious havens of the Scottish coasts ; and \u2014 \u2014 ~ after a partial visit in 866, a more formidable armament sailed from Dublin, under Anlaf and Ivar, in 870. During ore. ' \u00b0 \"\u00b0 this invasion, they took Alclyd, or Dunbarton, ravaged the whole extent of North Britain, and returned, glutted with slaughter and booty, to Ireland. These sea-wolves having once tasted blood, were not slow to return. Thrice under the same reign were their vessels seen on the coasts of the devoted countiy, in 871, 875, and 876 ; and at last, in 881, the Scottish monarch met his death on the banks of the Forth, iu an ineffectual attempt to defend his people, and repel their ravages. Reappearing under the reign of Donald, who succeeded to the throne in 893, they were defeated on the banks of the Tay, in the vicinity of Scone, and again, in 904, were repul- \u2014 sed by the same prince, who lost his Use, after be had slain then- leader. This, however, did not prevent their return 90^- in 907, and afterwards, in 918, under the reign of Constan- tine the Third, who, with the assistance of the northern Saxons, encountered and repulsed them at Tiumore ; a check which appears for a considerable period to have given repose to the kingdom."], [26, "[A. D. 1014 12 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 4. In 961, during the reign of Indulf, who had succeeded to the throne in 953, the Vikinghr made a descent in the bay of Cullen, in Banffshire ; and this monarch with difficulty defeated them in I . _ I a desperate action, in which he lost his life. In 970, Ken- ' ' neth the Third, who is represented as a monarch of extra 1 ordinary vigour and ambition, succeeded to the throne, and during his reign the Danes reappeared with a numerous fleet in the Tay ; but after a sanguinary straggle, in which they were at first successful, they were ultimately defeated by the bravery of the Scots, commanded by Kenneth in person. This contest, which ap pears to have been attended with enormous loss on both sides, took place at Luncarty, where many tumuli still remain, to mark the field of battle. 5. After this the countiy enjoyed quiet for nine years ; but in 1003, the Norsemen, who had now for some time permanently set tled themselves in Orkney, again made then- appearance in great strength upon the coast of Moray. They seized and fortified the promontory known by the name of the Burgh-head of Moray, where | they found a commodious harbour, and from which they ' led an army to plunder that fertile region. But they were met and defeated with great slaughter by Malcolm the Second, in the battle of Mortlach, where the king, in gratitude for his victory, endowed a religious house, which became the seat of the earliest Scottish bishopric. 6. These repeated repulses checked and disheartened the pirate kings ; but they disdained to relinquish the contest. Their last efforts appear to have been made on the coast of Angus and Buchan, where they were repulsed in successive conflicts, fought at Aber lemno, Panbride, and Slaines Castle. At length a convention, or . y. pacific treaty, was entered into between Malcolm and ' ' Sweno, king of Denmark, which was followed by the eva- '_ cuation of the Burgh-head of Moray, and the final depar ture of the Danes. Thus, after a severe struggle, which, at various intervals, and with various success, appears to have continued for nearly a century and a half (866 to 1014), the energy of the Scots ultimately triumphed over the efforts of the Norsemen, and com pelled Sweno, one of their most powerful princes, to desist from the contest. 7. The second event of importance which marked this period, was the enlargement of the Scottish provinces of Malcolm the First, by the pacific acquisition of Cumberland from Edmund, the Saxon king of England. Against this j-oung prince the Danes, who had established themselves in the northern part of bis dominions, de clared war, and, calling the Norwegians to their assistance, threat-"], [27, "A. D. 1018.] SCOTTISH PERIOD. 13 ened to subdue the whole countiy. Edmund opposed them with great courage and success, reduced Northumberland, then a Danish province, and next turned his arms against Cumbria, or Cumber land. After wasting this country, then inhabited by the Britons, under their king or chief leader, Dunmail, the English prince, aware perhaps of the difficulty of retaiuing bis new acquisition, delivered it up to Malcolm the First, under the condition that he would be come his associate {medwertha) in wax, or that he would defend the northern parts of England from the invasions of his enemies, whether they came by sea or by land. 8. This treaty was followed by the reigns of Indulf, Duf, and Culen, a dark and sanguinary period, occupied by domestic war and ~ y~\\ civil commotion ; but under Kenneth the Third, who came to the throne in 970, occurred another event of no little moment in the history of the country. This was the con quest of the ancient British kingdom of Strathclyd by the arms of that monarch. This state arose, in the middle of the fifth century, from a union of the Romanized British tribes, who, on the deser tion of the island by the Romans, were drawn together by the ties of common danger and mutual defence. From this time (446), they had, under various reverses and multiplied attacks, enjoyed a precarious independence for upwards of five centuries : and they did not permit themselves to be incorporated in the Scottish monarchy without a detennined struggle. The arms and the energy of Ken neth, however, were successful ; and one of those gleams of roman tic light, which sometimes- soften the gloomy annals of these ages, fell on the ruins of Strathclyd. Dunwallon, the last of its kings, after displaying the utmost valour and resolution in defence of his people, assumed the religious habit, travelled to Rome, and died a monk. 9. The last prominent event which marks this period, was the further enlargement of the Scottish dominions, by the acquisition of Lothian, hitherto a part of England. This took place in 1016, under the reign of Malcolm the Second, the son of Kenneth the Third, to whose conquest of Strathclyd we have just alluded. It was this same Malcolm whose courage we have seen victorious over the Danes at Mortlach, and to whese convention with Sweno, Scot land owed its freedom from the ravages of the pirate kings. In r\u2014i the beginning of the eleventh century, this warlike prince ! engaged in hostilities with Ughtred, Earl of Northumber j 1018- land. Their forces met at Carham, near Wark, on the southern bank of the Tweed, and a sanguinary battle was fought, which effectually checked the Scottish prince. Ughtred, however. having been assassinated, was succeeded by his brother Eadulph, a"], [28, "[A. D. 1018, 14 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. feebler ruler, who, from the dread of a second invasion, was induced to purchase the friendship of Malcolm, by the cession of the whole of Lothian. 10. Such are the great features which distinguish the early his- tory of Scotland, from the middle of the ninth to the commence- ment of the eleventh century (843 to 1018), and upon which it is both wiser and easier to fix the mind, than to crowd and burden it with lists of barbarous and forgotten kings. We see a people, still rude, ignorant, and, except for the influence of Christianity, little removed from savage life ; but we find them, at the same time, not only vindicating their freedom against those incessant and cruel in- vasions which for a time subdued the neighbouring country of Eng- land, but animated by an ambition which, under successive princes, largely extended then- dominions, by the successive acquisitions of Cumberland, Strathclyd, and Lothian. Nor is the remaining por- tion of the Scottish period, from 1018 to 1097, unmarked by some great events. In 1031, under the reign of Malcolm the Second, Canute, the Danish king of England, invaded Scotland. This prince, the most powerful monarch of his time, as he possessed not only England, but Denmark and Norway, led an army against Malcolm. The cause of the war is involved in much obscurity. It was, how ever, connected with some claim or dispute regarding Cumberland, and it terminated in Malcolm retaining the possession of that pro vince, and performing the conditions upon which it had been trans ferred to him. 11. Malcolm the Second, whose severe and vigorous reign had been marked by many sanguinary domestic feuds, not necessary to be detailed, was succeeded in 1033 by his grandson Duncan. This prince, the \"gracious Duncan\" of Shakspeare, had not been long seated on the throne, when his possession of it was contested by Macbeth, also a grandson of Malcolm the Second, by the mother's side. The father of Macbeth had been slain by Malcolm ; and the wrongs of the Lady Gruoch, his wife, were even deeper than his own. She had seen her grandfather Kenneth the Fourth dethron ed by Malcolm, her brother assassinated, and her former husband burned, griefs amply sufficient to torn her milk to gall. Revenge and ambition were thus equally roused in both their bosoms ; and then- designs, which had been arrested by the superior vigour and courage of Malcolm, were executed on his more feeble grandson. Duncan, in 1039, was assassinated at Bothgowanan, near Elgin ; and Macbeth seized the sceptre, which he held with a vigorous grasp for fifteen years, until he was defeated and slain by Macduff, in 1054. 12. On his death, a contest for the throne arose between Lu-"], [29, "MACBETH, a.d. 1039."], [30, ""], [31, "A. D. 1018. J SCOTTISH PERIOD. - 15 lach, the son of the Lady Graoch, and great-grandson of Ken- neth the Fourth, and Malcolm Canmore, the son of Duncan, and great-grandson of Malcolm the Second. The struggle terminated in 1057, by the defeat of Lulach, and the accession of his rival, Malcolm, who was contemporary with Edward the Confessor. 13. The accession of Malcolm Canmore to the Scottish throne was soon afterwards followed by an event, which, although taking place in the sister countiy, produced the most important effects upon the history of Scotland. This was the invasion aud conquest of England by the Normans, and the establishment of an entirely new dynasty in that country. The first consequence of this change was favourable to Malcolm, as it led to his marriage with a Saxon prin- cess, whose character had a ma: ked and favourable influence upon the ruder manners of her husband and his people. This lady was Margaret, the sister of Edgar Atheling. It is important to trace her lineage. Canute, the Danish king of England, had banished Edwin and Edward, the children of Edmund Ironside, the last oi the pure Saxon dynasty, for Edward the Confessor was half a Norman. They found a retreat in Hungary, where Edwin died ; but Edward was, in 1057, recalled by Edward the Confessor. This prince had three children, a son, Edgar, commonly called Edgar Atheling, the heir of the Saxon line, and two daughters, Margaret and Christian. On the conquest of England, the nobles of North- umberland, who were principally of Danish origin, becoming dis- gusted at the Norman tyranny, fled to the court of Malcolm, tak- ing with them Edgar and Ms two sisters. Edgar was weak, al- most to imbecility ; and in the event of his dying, or being found incapable of filling the throne, Ids claims as hen of the Saxon line descended to his sister. She was beautiful, accomplished, and pious ; and a union which, perhaps, at a distance, had been suggested to Malcolm by ambition, on a nearer view was perfected by love. 14. The marriage of the Scottish monarch was soon followed by an invasion of England, in which Malcolm ravaged the bishopric of Durham. The manner in which this predatory inroad was conduct ed, marks the ferocity of the times. Malcolm and his subjects were Christians ; yet even the churches were destroyed and burnt, while the unhappy persons who had fled to them for sanctuary were mas sacred, or consumed in the flames. During the occurrence of these savage scenes in England, Gospatric, one of the most powerful of the Northumbrian barons, whose assistance William the Conqueror had secured, swept through Malcolm's territory of Cumberland, and laid waste the countiy in a miserable manner, upon which the Scottish prince returned home, leading captive such a multitude of"], [32, "[A. D. 1072. 16 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. young men and maidens, that for many years they were to be found in every Scottish village. 15. There seems to be little doubt that this expedition of Mal colm was intimately connected with the determined stand made against William the Conqueror by the Northumbrian earls who i had canied Edgar Atheling into Scotland. Combining I in 1069 with the Danes, who brought a powerful fleet to I 1Q69, their assistance, they advanced as far as York, where they put the Norman garrison to the sword. Here it is probable they expected to be joined by Malcolm, but being disappointed in their hope, they made peace with William, who had the address to dis solve the confederacy. Malcolm alone continued faithful to the cause of the Saxon prince; and, though deserted by his confede rates, yet by invading England fulfilled his agreement. 16. This inroad led to a dreadful retaliation on the part of William. To punish the revolt, and to oppose a wilderness to the invasions of the Danes, he laid entirely waste the fertile country which lies between the Huniber and the Tees. The inhabitants of this district seem to have been almost wholly exterminated. Many who escaped the sword died of famine ; many sold them selves for slaves ; while those of higher quality, Norman as well as Saxon, sought an asylum in Scotland, and found at the court of Malcolm a favourable reception. 17. William having secured peace at home, prepared an armament I 7 y. against Scotland, and in 1072 invaded that country, both | ' '\u25a0' by sea and land. Malcolm wisely met superior power by I ' ' an offer of submission. He sought and obtained peace, gave hostages, and performed homage for the lands which he held in England. 18. Of the Northumbrian barons who fled from the Conqueror to the court of Malcolm, bringing with them the hen- of the Saxon line and his sisters, one of the most powerful was Gospatric. Prov ing treacherous to Malcolm, this noble had obtained from William the government of Northumberland ; but on his return from his successful expedition against Malcolm, the Norman conqueror, from jealousy or disgust, degraded his Northumbrian ally, who once more fled to the Scottish king. Malcolm, on his part, not only forgave him, but presented him with the lands and castle of Dun bar, and the castle of Cockburnspath. He who held these estates, lying on the borders between the two countries, might be said to have the keys of Scotland at his girdle ; aud the circumstance is worthy of remembrance, not only as marking the origin of a potent family, destined to act a leading part in the future history of the country, but as indicating the policy of Malcolm, who, conscious of"], [33, "A. JJ. 1091.] SCOTTISH PERIOD. 17 the inferiority of his own Celtic race, manifested a wise anxiety to prevail on strangers, whether Normans, Danes, or Saxons, to settle in his dominions. 19. The remaining portion of the reign of this energetic prince A tj_ (1079-1093,) is chiefly distinguished by a struggle with 1079' WiUiain Rufus, who, upon the death of the Conqueror, t0 succeeded to the English throne. This prince appears to 1093. nave \"\"\"ifuheld from Malcolm part of the English posses- __ sions to which he claimed a right ; and with the tow of compelling then- restoration, the Scottish king invaded England, and penetrated as far os the Wear. Rufus led against him a su- perior force ; and Malcolm, aware of his approach, prudently de- clined a contest, and by a timely retreat secured his plunder and his captives. 20. This appears to have taken place in May 1091 ; and in the ' \u00bb y. autumn of the same year, the Norman prince, having I irioi equipped a flees 1 and levied a numerous land force, led his I army in person against Scotland. He continued his march to the shores of the Forth ; but here his progress was stayed, in consequence of his receiving intelligence that his fleet had been de- stroyed by a tempest. There were no vessels to transport his troops across the Forth. The Scots, with a policy which they early learn- ed, and repeatedly practised, had driven away then- cattle, and cleared the country of provisions ; and at this crisis, when the in- vaders were perishing from famine, Malcolm led his army against them, crossed the Forth, and advanced into Lothian ; a territory originally, as we have seen, acquired from the Angles, and there- fore esteemed a part of England, although now subject to the Scot- tish king. Here, having chosen a strong position, he encamped, and, avoiding a battle, harassed the enemy, proposing to cut off his supplies, and expel him by famine. While both parties were thus situated, Edgar Atheling, now with Rufus, and Robert, the king's brother, exerted themselves to bring about a peace. The English monarch, notwithstanding his fiery temper, knew how to bend his fury to Ms interest ; and Malcolm, perceiving that he could obtain his purpose by treaty, wisely preferred this to the risk of a battle. It is important to mark the conditions of the agree- ment. William Rufus consented to restore to Malcolm twelve manors, which the Scottish prince had held under the Conqueror, and to make an annual payment to him of twelve marks of gold. Malcolm, on his part, consented to do homage to William, and to hold his lands in England under the same tenure of feudal service and obedience to him, as he had formerly paid to his father the Con queror. .. a 2"], [34, "[A. D. 1092. 18 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 21. Pausing here for a moment on a subject which has given rise to some discordant opinions, we would remark that all as yet seems clear as to the homage paid by the kings of Scotland to those of England. It has just been stated that Malcolm agreed to obey William Ruflis on the same conditions as he had obeyed William the Conqueror. Under the Conqueror it is certain that Malcolm held twelve manors in England. These Rufus had seized ; but he now restored them, and Malcolm renewed his obligation of homage. On a former occasion when, as we have seen, the Scottish king, in 1072, paid his homage to the Conqueror in person, the ground upon which he paid it is equally clear. Previously to the battle of Hast ings, the Scottish monarchs had obtained from the Saxon Idngs some possessions in England. This was before the introduction of strict feudal tenures by the Normans ; but there is no doubt that these possessions were held under the condition of aiding the Saxon princes in repelling the Danes. When William the Conqueror esta blished himself in England, Malcolm considered him as a usurper of the rights of his brother-in-law, Edgar Atheling ; and, on this ground, as well as perhaps from an indisposition to embrace a sys tem which must have been new to him, he had at first refused to pay homage for the lands he held in England. Circumstances, however, made him change this resolution. The prevailing power of William, the acquiescence of the English under his government, and the inactivity and imbecility of Edgar Atheling, his brother-in law, induced him to desist from a conflict in which he ceased to have an interest. A more intimate acquaintance with the feudal tenures introduced into England taught him, that, in the acknow ledgment of superiority for the lands which he held in that country, there was no sacrifice of dignity as an independent monarch ; and as all idea of restoring Edgar was abandoned, he paid homage to the Conqueror. 22. The point of homage seemed thus prudently settled ; but the 1 , y. proud and fiery temper, which appears to have been an in- firmity of both princes, soon led to a new contest between I '_ Malcolm and Rufus. A jealousy of the incursions of the Scots had formerly led the Conqueror to build two strong castles, the one at Durham, the other at Newcastle. To these his succes sor now added a third at Carlisle ; a barrier which, however neces sary, might possibly be considered as encroaching on the freedom of the lands which Malcolm held in Cumberland. A dispute arose, and a personal interview between the two kings having been con sidered the best mode of settling then differences, Malcolm repaired to Gloucester, where Rufus met him, and proposed that he should ac homage in presence of his English barons. This the Scottish"], [35, "A. D. 1093.] SCOTTISH PERIOD. 19 monarch refused ; although he was ready, he said, to perform his homage on the frontiers of both kingdoms, as had been the ancient usage. The reply was angrily received, and the two kings having parted with expressions of defiance, Malcolm assembled an army, and advancing with speed, whetted by the indignity with which lie had been treated, burst into Northumberland, which he wasted with fire and sword. Sweeping onwards to Alnwick he was about to possess himself of the castle, when the Scottish army was attacked ' . y. ] by Robert de Mowbray. In the battle which ensued Mal- ' \" colm was slain, and Edward, his eldest son, shared the '_ same fate. 23. Li reviewing the reign of Malcolm the Third, we may dis cern a character of steady persevering courage. From his early youth to his last invasion of England his character was uniform. He maintained his throne with the same spirit by which he won it. Though he was the ruler of a nation uncivilized, and destitute of foreign resources, and had such antagonists as the Conqueror and William Rufus to encounter, yet for twenty-seven years he sup ported this unequal contest, sometimes with success, never with out honour. That he should have so well asserted the indepen dence of Scotland is astonishing, when the weakness of his own kingdom, and the strength and abilities of his enemies, are fairly estimated. 24. Malcolm's eldest son had fallen, as we have seen, with his \u2022- _ father ; and his remaining sons, Ethelred, Edmund, Ed- I ' ' gar, Alexander, and David, were all under age. On the usurpation of the throne by Macbeth, his brother, Donald Bane, had taken refuge in the Hebrides, and appears to have re mained in that distant retreat during the whole of Malcolm's reign. Being joined by several of the island chiefs, he now invaded Scot land with a powerful fleet, and seized the crown ; but he held it for a veiy brief season. Duncan, an illegitimate son of Malcolm, had, in 1072, been delivered to William Rufus as a hostage for his father's fidelity. He had received his education at the Norman court, and, having been knighted by the English monarch, was re tained in his service. With permission of William, he returned t( i Scotland, and, assisted by a band of English and Norman adven turers, expelled Donald Bane. He, in his turn, after a reign of little more than a year, was assassinated, and Donald once more ascended the throne, from which, in 1097, he was again expelled by William Rufus, who dispatched Edgar Atheling with a powerful armv into Scotland. By this prince the aged usurper was defeated : and Edgar, the son of Malcolm and Margaret, the nephew of Edgar Atheling, ascended the throne. This event took place in the close"], [36, "[A. D. 1097. 20 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. f of the eleventh century ; and with the captivity and death of Donald Bane, who is the last of the race of Scoto-Lish 1097' 1 kings, the Scottish period expires. CHAPTER rV. Institutions and Manners. 1. Having thus passed over a portion of our history, which ex tends from the middle of the ninth to the end of the eleventh cen tury, let us pause to say a few words on the condition of the church, the state of the laws, and the manners of the people. Looking first to that most important and interesting point, the state of the church, we have afready seen that, at the commencement of the Pictish period in 446, Christianity had been introduced into North Britain. Of the exact constitution, discipline, and orders in the early Scottish church, from the conversion of the Scots to the com mencement of the Scoto-Pictish period (843), much has been writ ten, by the advocates of Episcopacy on the one hand, and the sup porters of Presbyterianism on the other. Into this discussion it be longs not to our plan to enter ; but we may be permitted to ob serve, that, from the authentic muniments which still remain in our own times, it seems difficult to avoid drawing the conclusion that the primitive and most ancient form of church government in Scot land was Episcopal. At the memorable epoch of the union of the Picts and Scots, we find a bishopric of Lindisfeme extending far into Lothian. In Lothian itself, the religious houses of Melrose, Coldingham, Tyningham, Pefferham, and Abercorn, had been long established. Looking beyond the Friths, we find that, at the same period, various religious cells had been settled by the disciples of Columba ; and that not long afterwards, Kenneth Macalpin, anxi ous to testify his respect for the memory of this apostle of the Scots, removed his relics from Iona to Dunkeld, where he built a church (840), which became, till supplanted by St Andrews, the seat of the primate of the Scottish church. The Episcopal sees existing within the period of which we now treat, from 843 to 1097, were, the bishoprics of the Isles, Galloway, Glasgow, Dunkeld, St An drews, and Mortlach, afterwards Aberdeen. 2. The united kingdom of the Picts and Scots was divided into parishes, though neither the time nor the circumstances of this di vision can be clearly ascertained amid the gloom which hangs over the church during the Scottish period. We may easily suppose that these ecclesiastical districts were gradually established subse-"], [37, "INSTITUTIONS AND MANNERS. 21 quent to the great epoch of 843 ; aud they appear to have been formed by private persons rather than by public authority. That parishes existed during the reign of Malcolm Canmore, is certain from unquestionable records. It seems equally certain, that when churches were erected, parishes laid out, and parochial duties stated ly performed, tithes and ecclesiastical dues must have been paid. In the charters of Alexander the First, and of David, tithes are mentioned as if they were familiarly known, and had been long esta blished. Dmlng the reign of Malcolm Canmore, several national councils were held in Scotland, for the establishment of ecclesiasti cal discipline, and the reformation of the rude and fierce manners of the people. 3. During this period, we meet with frequent mention of au order of religious men named Culdees, who first appear in the be ginning of the ninth century. They seem to have been a kind of secular presbyters or monks, the Gaelic term Culdee meaning a re cluse or hermit. In north Britain, they had religious houses at Abernethy, Dunkeld, St Andrews, Dunblane, Brechin, Mortlach, Aberdeen, Monymusk, Lochleven, Portmoak, Dunfermline. Scone, and Kirkcaldy. 4. Little can be affirmed with certainty regarding the laws whicu regulated the government, restrained the crimes, or directed the succession of a fierce and barbarous people who have left no written records. Of this, however, there can be no doubt, that, through out the whole of this period, the predominant people being a Celtic race, the laws, the government, the manners, the customs, and the language, were all Celtic. As far as can be conjectured, the crown was neither strictly hereditary nor strictly elective, but directed in its descent by what has been termed the law of 1'anistry ; an institution by which the person in the family of the reigning prince, who was judged best qualified, whether son, brother, or even more remote relative, was chosen, under the name of Tanist, to lead the army during the life of the king, and to succeed to him after his death. It has been asserted, that, at this era, the tenure of land throughout the country terminated with the life of the possessor ; but this assertion evidently requires some modification, as it indi cates a state of barbarism even greater than is discovered by the few glimpses of light which sometimes shoot athwart this twilight of our history. By a custom which the Scots evidently brought with them from Ireland, denominated in Llsh ghabhail-cine, mean ing literally family settlements, it appears, that the fathers of fami lies divided their lands among their sons, sometimes in equal, sometimes in unequal portions, and strictly excluded females from any share in this appropriation. The Scottish kings, during those times, seem not to have possessed legislative power. Whenever"], [38, "22 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. they acted as legislators, they appear to have had as coadjutors, either bishops, or maormors, a term by which we are to understand the chief rulers of districts. As to their legislative code, there seems to be little doubt that the nearest approach we can make to the laws or usages of Celtic Scotland, must be by the study of such fragments as remain to us of the brehon laws of Leland. These were not written laws, but only the will of the brehons or lords, who, like the physicians, bards, harpers, poets, and historians, had heir offices by descent and inheritance. The brehon, when he ad ministered justice, used to sit on a turf or heap of stones, or on the top of a hillock, without a covering, without clerks, or indeed any formality of a court of judicature. A similar state of law may be traced among the Scoto-Irish in Scotland, where every baron had his mote-hill, whence justice was distributed to his vassals by his baron-bailie. There seems to be little doubt that Malcolm, from his marriage with a Saxon princess, and his frequent intercourse with the Saxon and Norman people, was an admirer of their supe rior civilisation, and anxious to introduce their usages among his own ruder subjects. But that he succeeded to any material degree is extremely problematical ; and the notion that he introduced the complicated system of the feudal law into Scotland, has been long ago exploded. 5. The social state of the Celtic tribes in Scotland was similar to that which we find existing among them in Leland, namely, a state of constant war ; and to those who consider how slow is the progress of improvement, and how strong the principle of imitation and tradition among a savage people, it will be no subject of won der that we find little change produced by the lapse of centuries upon the manners of the ancient British, whether we look to Wales, Ireland, or North Britain. Their marriages, their mode of burial, their dress, their war cries, were similar. Armorial bearings, dur ing this whole period, were unknown ; seals and coined money they had none ; and the Gaelic people of Scotland borrowed their very terms for the several denominations of money from the Scoto- Saxon inhabitants. Thus the Gaelic feorling, farthing, is from the Saxon feorthing ; the Gaelic peighin, a penny, is from the Saxon penig. 6. In the rude ages of which we write, stones of memorial were frequently employed, and many of them still remain ; yet as they are found without inscriptions, and are only occasionally ornament ed by rude hieroglyphics, the memory of the events which they de scribe has perished. Inaugural stones, also, were used by them, upon which not only the Irish and Scottish kings were placed on their accession to the crown ; but the chiefs of septs, or petty rt guli, were accustomed on the same to take the oaths to their vas-"], [39, "INSTITUTIONS AND MANNERS 23 sals, wheii they succeeded to the power of then former clues. To the same class of inaugural stones belongs, as is well known, the famous coronation stone of Scotland. Tradition reports this sin gular relic to have been brought from Ireland by Kenneth ; it was undoubtedly canied off from Scone by Edward the First, who in serted it into a chair, which he placed before the shrine of Edward the Confessor in Westminster Abbey. 7. In a life of Columba, which was written only eighty years al ter the saint's death, we find frequent mention of houses of wattle. Even the abbey of Iona was originally built of the same rude mate rials. The clothing of the monks seems to have been often com posed of the skins of beasts, though latterly they had woollen stuffs and linen, the woollen probablymanufacturedby themselves, the linen imported from the continent. Venison, fish, niilk, flesh, and wild fowl, were the common food of the people. The monks of Iona lived by their labour, cultivating then- fields, and la}ing up corn in their granaries. Iona had even its orchards in the rugged times of the ninth century, till the vikinghr, or pirate kings, ravaged and ruined all. The little vessels used for sailing were constructed by covering a keel of wood and a frame of wicker- work with the skins of cattle and of deer. These were denominated currachs. After wards they were enlarged, and made capable of containing a re spectable crew. It was in a vessel of this description, a wicker boat covered with hides, that Columba, accompanied by twelve of his friends, embarked from Ireland, and landed in Iona.

We have already seen, that the death of Malcolm Canmore at Alnwick gave rise to a temporary usurpation of the throne by Donald his brother; that he was expelled by Duncan, an illegitimate son of Malcolm, who had been educated at the court of William Ru fus ; and that this Duncan having been assassinated, Edgar Atheling led an English army into Scotland, and placed Edgar, the son of Mal colm Canmore, on the throne. Edgar's reign was brief, pacific, and of little interest ; but his successor, Alexander the First, the eldest I a j) surviving son of Malcolm, was a prince of a powerful and ! * 10si * vigorous character. From his accession to the throne, m ' '\u2014 the commencement of the twelfth century (1106), to the death of Alexander the Third (1285), towards the close of the thir teenth, the nation was progressive and prosperous in a degree un equalled during the whole course of its future history. Under a"], [41, "A. D. 1109.] SCOTO-SAXOX PERIOD. 25 succession of six monarchs, Alexander the First, David the Fiist, Malcolm the Fourth, William the Lion, Alexander the Second, and Alexander the Third, it maintained its independence against foreign aggression, and not only preserved the integrity, but extended tiie boundaries of its dominions. Its commerce, its manufactures, its agriculture, aud all the arts which improve and humanize an igno rant and fierce people, were encouraged ; and in the personal cha racter of each of these successive princes, there were an energy and a boldness which communicated themselves to the people, and maintained the nation at the standard to which each ruler in his turn had raised it. 2. In the character of Alexander the First, everything seems to \u2022 . \u2014 have been in excess ; but happily the qualities which were \" \" so overcharged, were most of them of the better sort. He is traditionally remembered by the epithet of the fierce; and though humble and courteous to his clergy, whom he deemed entitled to this homage as God's servants, not his, he was, to use the words of an ancient and authentic writer, \" ter rible beyond measure to Iris subjects.\" The leading event of his reign was the struggle which he maintained for the independence of the Scottish church against the pretended rights claimed, first by the see of York, and afterwards by that of Canterbury. On the election of Turgot, a monk of Durham, to the bishopric of St An drews (1109), the Archbishop of York insisted on having the right to consecrate him. To this the Scottish king declared he would never agree ; and a compromise having taken place, by which the point was left undecided, Alexander, on the death of Turgot, changed his ground, and chose for his successor Eadmer, a monk of Canter bury. The same right of consecration, founded on the same ground of the alleged dependence of the Scottish church upon the primacy of England, was now advanced by Canterbury ; but it was still more haughtily and peremptorily refused by Alexander. A com promise again took place. Eadmer accepted the ring from the king, and took the pastoral staff from the altar, as if receiving it from the Lord ; but finding his authority weakened, and the countenance of the monarch withdrawn from him, he intimated his resolution of re pairing to Canterbury for advice. This Alexander violently oppos ed, declaring that, as long as he lived, the bishop of St Andrews should never be subject to that see. Nor did he fail to keep his word : Eadmer remained an elected but unconsecrated bishop. At length, weary of the contest, and trammelled in his usefulness, he desired permission to resign, restored the ring to the king, replaced the pastoral staff on the high altar, and returned to Canterbury. B"], [42, "[A. D. 1138. 26 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Robert, prior of Scone, was elected to fill the vacant see, and the king's determined efforts to maintain the independence of the Scot tish church were crowned with success. It had continued for four teen years, and Alexander survived its termination only a single year. He died in 1124, leaving no children by his wife Sybilla, a natural daughter of Henry the First, and was succeeded by his brother, David the First. 3. Edgar, the brother of this prince, had, on his deathbed, be- queathed to him that portion of Cumberland which was possessed by the Scottish kings. This legacy had two good effects : it called the young prince early to the cares and labours of administration ; and it removed him from Scotland to a countiy where he became acquainted with a more advanced civilisation, and better regulated government. These advantages were not thrown away upon David. His natural dispositions were excellent ; his love of justice, his capacity for labour, his sense of the national honour aud independence, his affection to every class of his people, his tenderness to his children, his piety to God, were all so conspicuous in his character, that Buchanan pronounces him the perfect exemplar of a good king ; and the progress made by the country during the twenty-nine years of Ms reign goes far to justify the assertion. 4. David's reign was contemporary with those of Hemy the First \u00bbnd of Stephen in England, and it opened with many difficulties. The question of the independence of the church was again started ; and before it could be brought to a termination, the forcible seiz ure of the English crown by Stephen, who deposed Matilda, the daughter of Hemy the First, involved him in a war with that usurper. During the life of Henry the First, David and Stephen had sworn to maintain the right of Matilda ; and the Scottish mon arch, in obedience to his oath, invaded England, and compelled the barons of the northern portion of that kingdom to swear fealty to this princess. His efforts, however, were more honourable than successful ; and after a war which lasted three years, David was ul- T Y) timately defeated in the great battle of the Standard, 1138 f\u00b0ught on Cutton Moor, in the neighbourhood of Northal- 1 lerton. Peace was now concluded, and the terms to which Stephen consented, indicate that, although defeated, the Scottish king was but little humbled. The earldom of Northumberland, with the exception of the two castles of Newcastle and Bamborough, was ceded to Prince Hemy, David's eldest son. As an equivalent for these fortresses, lands were granted to him in the south of Eng land ; the barons of Northumberland were to hold their estates of Henry, the Prince of Scotland, reserving their fealty to Stephen ;"], [43, "A. D. 1153.] SC0T0-SAX0N PERIOD. 27 and, in return, David and all his people became bound to maintain an inviolable peace with England. 5. The remaining years of the reign of this wise monarch were pacific and prosperous. The war with the English had convinced him that the latter were far superior to his own people in arms and discipline ; and as it had been undertaken in fulfilment of his oath to Hemy, not from any love of conquest, having now satisfied his conscience, he devoted his life to the arts of good government. During the course of his sage administration, public buildings were erected, towns established, agriculture, manufactures, and com merce supported. The barbarities of his people in their invasions of England had affected him with the deepest anguish ; and be lieving that religion was the only agent which could humanize and improve the savage multitudes whom he had led, but could not re strain, he endowed the church with new privileges, enriched it with extensive grants of land, founded various bishoprics, built many monasteries, and exhibited in his own person so excellent an ex ample of royal greatness, chastened and purified by Christian hu mility and devotion, that it could not fail to have the best effects npon his people. 6. Towards the close of his reign, it was his misfortune to lose , _ his eldest son, Prince Henry, who had just reached man- hood, and had already exhibited many of the excellent '_ qualities of his father. The blow sunk deep into his heart ; but David's first care had been for his people ; and he roused him self to provide for the pacific succession of his grandson Malcolm, a child in his twelfth year. By his orders, this boy, the son of Prince Henry, was canied in a progress through his dominions, to receive the homage of the barons and the people, and was solemn ly proclaimed heir to the crown. Having performed this wise but . y. mournful duty, the aged king within a year followed his son to the grave. It is a remarkable and beautiful circum 1153. atance, that he was found dead in an attitude of devotion, his hands being clasped upon his breast, in the veiy posture in which he seems to have been raising them to heaven. 7. The reign of Malcolm the Fourth, which lasted only twelve i \u25a0 I years, offers little for our observation. It began with those evils which so invariably attend a minority ; war without, and insecurity within the kingdom. Somerled, the thane i t0 of Argyle, strengthened by the naval powers of the Isles, _ *\"\"\u2022 invaded Scotland, and for some years continued to harass the country by repeated attacks, which at length terminated in an amicable agreement. The transactions of Malcolm with Hemy the Second of England impress us with an unfavourable notion of this"], [44, "28 [A.D. 1165. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. young prince. It had been a promise of the English monarch, made to David the First, in 1149, that, if he succeeded to the crown of England, he would cede to Scotland for ever the territory be tween the Tyne and the Tweed. Instead of insisting on this, Mal colm, overreached by the superior sagacity of Hemy, or betrayed by the treachery of his counsellors, abandoned to England his whole possessions in the northern counties, and received in return the honour of Huntingdon ; a measure which created universal discon tent in the nation. These feelings of distrust were imprudently in creased by an expedition of the young prince into France, where he joined the army of Hemy, claimed from him the distinction of knighthood, and outraged the feelings of national jealousy, by for getting his station as an independent prince, and fighting under the banner of the English monarch. A deputation from the Scots was sent into France, to remonstrate against this conduct, and the mem bers of it did not hesitate in bold language to reproach their king for the desertion of 1ns duty. Galloway rose in rebellion ; the in habitants of Moray about the same time threw off their allegiance ; and Somerled, the thane of Argyle, invaded the countiy with a for midable fleet. Although the obstinacy of the king had brought these disasters upon himself, his energy and decision met and overcame them. He hurried from France, conciliated his nobles, invaded and subdued Galloway, repulsed Somerled, and, after suppressing the rebellion in Moray, adopted the extraordinary measure of dispos sessing its ancient inhabitants, compelling them to settle in more distant parts of his dominions, and planting new colonies in their room. These energetic measures were his last, for he died imme diately after, at an early age, and was succeeded by his brother Wilham the Second, son of Henry, Prince of Scotland, and grand son of David the First. 8. In the reign of this prince, which was the longest in Scottish ~ \u201e histoiy, the most important events were, the disgraceful 1 * ' surrender of the national independence to Henry the Second in 1174, and its recovery from Richard the First in 1189. ]91 , Both transactions require particular notice. It was the 1 weakness of William to be guided by impulse. Smitten with an admiration for the warlike qualities of Henry the Second, and uninstructed by the misfortunes of his predecessor Malcolm, he first courted this prince, and, being disappointed in his object of procur ing from his justice the restitution of Northumberland, afterwards imprudently defied him. War ensued ; and the king of the Scots having advanced with his army to Alnwick, was surprised, made prisoner, and shut up in the castle of Falaise in Normandy. His impatience under captivity, and the longing of the barons and cler-"], [45, "A. D. 1188.] SCOTO-SAXON PERIOD. 29 gy for their king, led to a pusillanimous treaty, which will ever re main a blot upon the national honour. With consent of his baron? and clergy, given at Valogne on the 8th of December 1174, Wil liam agreed, on condition of receiving his liberty, to become the liegeman of Hemy for Scotland and all his other territories ; to de liver up to the English monarch the castles of Roxburgh, Berwick, Jedburgh, Edinburgh, and Stirling ; and to give his brother David and some of his chief barons as hostages. In this treaty, it is re markable, that, while little care was shewn for the independence ol the people, a clause was introduced, which left entire the independ ence of the Scottish church. This clause the bishops and clergy took the first opportunity of asserting before the Papal legate, in a council held at Northampton (1176). 9. On his return to his dominions, William appears to have de voted himself with much energy and success to the cares of govern ment. His dominions were weakened and distracted by repeated insurrections in Ross and in Galloway. In these wild and remote districts the native chiefs claimed almost a royal sway ; and the people, ferocious in then- habits, and jealous of all intercourse with England, were ready, upon the slightest provocation or encourage ment, to rise in rebellion. A pretender to the crown also appeared in the person of Donald, the grandson of Duncan, commonly called the bastard king of Scotland. This adventurer having seized Ross, and wasted Moray, William led an army against him ; and it was not till Donald fell, after a desperate struggle near Inverness, that tranquillity was restored to the countiy. 10. We have already seen how firmly the Scottish church had re sisted the idea of any dependence upon the metropolitan sees of York or Canterbury ; and we have adverted to the careful reserva tion of their rights by the clergy, at the moment when the king and the nobles bartered away what was not theirs to give, \u2014 the national I- independence. In this resolute conduct the clergy were ' A' supported by the king ; and in 1188, Clement the Third | H88. pron0unced a solemn decree, by which he declared that the church of Scotland was immediately subject to Rome itself; and that to the Pope alone, or his legate de latere, should belong the power of pronouncing any sentence of excommunication against that kingdom. 11. This important declaration was soon followed by another event, still more memorable, by which the kingdom recovered its independence. On the death of Henry the Second, Richard Cceur de Lion, his successor, then intent on collecting money for his ex pedition to the Holy Land, invited the King of Scotland to his court, and upon William's engaging to pay to him the sum of ten"], [46, "[A. D. 1214. 30 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. thousand merks, agreed to restore his kingdom to its independence, reserving only the homage formerly due by the Scottish kings for the lands which they held in England. The instrument by which this transaction was completed, declares, that Richard had delivered up to William, King of Scots, his castles of Roxburgh and Berwick ; had granted to him an acquittance of all obligations which had been extorted from him by Hemy the Second, in consequence of his cap tivity ; and had ordained the boundaries of the two kingdoms to be re-established as they existed at the date of William's imprison ment. The Scottish king was at the same time put in possession of all his fees in the earldom of Huntingdon ; and all the charters of homage done to Henry the Second by the Scottish barons were delivered up, and declared to be cancelled for ever. It was owing to the wise regulations of this treaty and the fidelity with which they were observed on both sides by its authors and their succes sors, that, for a century after its date, there occurred no national quarrel or hostilities between the two countries. The remaining portion of the reign of William demands little notice. During the latter years of it, the succession of John to his brother Richard the First threatened to dissolve the pacific relations between the two countries ; but war was happily averted, and the Scottish monarch reserved his energies for the pacification of his own realm, which was disturbed by a rebellion fh the northern counties. In 1214, the king died at Stirling, after a reign of forty-eight years, the long est, as already stated, in Scottish history. His name of William the Lion was probably owing to the circumstance that the lion ram pant first appears upon his shield, none of the Scottish kings before bis time having assumed a coat armorial. 12. William was succeeded by his son Alexander, a youth of se | . \u201e I venteen, to whom the barons had sworn homage in 1201, - ' \" and who was one of the wisest of the Scottish kings, whe- I 1 ther we regard the justice of his administration, the sea sonable severity with which he subdued all internal commotions in his kingdom, the firmness exhibited in his maintenance of the rights of the church, or the wisdom, forbearance, and vigour, which marked his policy towards England. His reign was one of constant action, and was full of incident. It commenced with his joining the Eng lish barons who resisted the tyranny of John. This conduct drew down upon him and his kingdom a sentence of excommunication (1216) ; but the papal terrors appear to have been little dreaded at this time ; and in 1218, the Pope not only abrogated the sentence pronounced by his legate, but confirmed the liberties of the Scottish church. 13. On the accession of Henry the Third to the English throne,"], [47, "A. D. 1249.] SCOTO-SAXON PERIOD. 31 Alexander, who was occupied in quelling the repeated insurrections in the northern parts of his dominions, shewed every disposition to cultivate amity with England ; and his marriage with the princess Joanna, sister of Henry, had a favourable effect in strengthening the ties between the two monarchs. 14. One of the striking features which mark the reign of this mo j j) I narch, is the gradual increase that is to be observed iu I 1244 t'ie P01,ver \u00b0f nobles, and the corresponding decrease in 1 the authority of the crown. But if this had injurious ef fects upon the general prosperity of the kingdom, and distracted it by internal private feuds, it encouraged a feeling of independence, and fostered a warlike spirit, which proved the best safeguard against the encroachments of its more powerful neighbours. This was strikingly shewn on the occurrence of a rupture between England and Scotland in 1244. Some time before this, Alexander had claimed from Henry, in right of inheritance, the counties of North umberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland ; and although the English king did not grant him his full demand, he admitted its justice, by transferring to him an equivalent in certain lands, which he accepted in full of all claims. For these lands the Scottish king did homage ; and both nionarehs remained on friendly terms for some years, when jealousies suddenly arose, and Hemy, alleging that homage had been unjustly withheld, led an army against Scot land. Under these threatening circumstances, the Scottish king, although he had recently experienced the resistance of his nobles to his personal requests, found himself strongly supported by the same barons against the meditated attack of England. They raised in a short time an army of a hundred thousand foot and a thousand horse ; and this demonstration of the national strength had happily the effect of restoring peace without bloodshed. It is worthy of notice, that when a papal legate visited Scotland under this reign, and held a provincial council in the capital, the king manifested the same jealousy of such a proceeding as had been exhibited by his predecessors. He seemed afraid lest the admission of a papal mes senger, whose message regarded England alone, should be deemed derogatory to the independence of the Scottish church ; and al though, at the request of the nobility of both countries, he consent ed to his coming into the kingdom, he declined a personal meeting, and stipulated that this permission should not be drawn into a pre cedent. 15. Having engaged in a maritime expedition against Angus of \" Argyle, one of those petty island chiefs whose dubious allegiance oscillated between Norway and Scotland, Alex- ander had conducted his fleet as far as the Sound of Mull,"], [48, "[A. D. 1263. 32 HISTORY OP SCOTLAND. when he was seized with a fever, and died in a small island named Kerrera, in the 35th year of his reign. He was succeeded by his son, Alexander the Third, a boy in his eighth year ; and the king dom, which had enjoyed, under his father's wise and vigorous ad ministration, an uncommon degree of prosperity, became immedi ately exposed to the many evils of a minority. Two parties divid ed the nobility, the one led by Walter Comyn, earl of Menteith. the other by Durward the High Justiciar ; and Henry the Third secretly wrote to the Pope, requesting him to interdict the corona tion of the young king. Scotland, he said, was a fee of England, Alexander his vassal, and his permission as superior had not been obtained. The Pope appears to have rejected this demand with promptitude, as derogatory to the rights of a sovereign prince ; and the ceremony of the coronation was performed at the abbey of Scone, the coronation oath being read first in Latin, and afterwards in Norman-French. 1 6. Alexander soon afterwards, in fulfilment of a former treaty, espoused Margaret, the youthful daughter of Henry, at York, and, in refusing to pay homage for his kingdom of Scotland, exhibited a spirit and intelligence superior to his years. \" I came,\" said he to the artful monarch, who made the proposal ; \" I came into Eng land on a joyful and pacific errand, not to answer to an arduous question, which belongs to the states of my kingdom.\" He at the same time made no objection to take the oath of fealty for the lands which he held in England. 17. Defeated in this attempt to overreach a minor sovereign, Henry commenced a series of intrigues with the Scottish nobles, with the object of obtaining an entire control over the affairs of the sister kingdom ; and the countiy was thus divided and distracted by two factions, the one acting under Engbsh influence, and the other more honestly contending for the freedom of their prince and the independent administration of the government. These scenes of civil faction and foreign interference continued till the monarch, having arrived at manhood, and developing a character of much energy and judgment, took the reins into his own hand, and com pelled his nobility to respect the laws, and support his measures. 18. Scarcely had this happy change occurred, when the king ~T ~ dom, which had afready suffered from the vicinity of the ' ' fleets of Norway, was threatened with an invasion by Haco, '_} one of its most warlike princes. The dispute which led to this menace originated in a circumstance already noticed ; the pre carious homage paid by the petty piratical chiefs of the Western Isles, who, as circumstances pressed on the one side or the other, acknowledged a feudal dependence on Scotland or on Norway. To"], [49, "A. D. 1285.] SCOT0-SAXON PERIOD. 33 support them in their independence of Alexander, Haco made a descent on the western coast of Scotland with a mighty fleet, but sustained a signal defeat at Largs, and, on his return with the shat tered remains of his ships, sickened and died at Orkney. The re sults of this victory were highly favourable to Scotland. It fixed the chiefs of the Western Isles in then- allegiance, secured to Alex ander the homage of the king of Man, aud convinced Norway that Scotland was not to be so easily subdued or overawed as its pirati cal princes had anticipated. 19. The remainder of this reign was prosperous, as far as the cir cumstances of the kingdom are considered, but unfortunate for the monarch, who was suddenly deprived by death of all his children. His eldest son, Alexander, died soon after his marriage, and his only daughter Margaret, the wife of Erie, king of Norway, was cut off in childbed, leaving an infant daughter, Margaret, commonly called the Maiden of Norwa}-, the heiress of the Scottish throne. These calamities induced the king, who was a widower, to make a second marriage. Having selected Joleta de Coney, daughter of the Count de Dreux, the nuptials were celebrated at Jedburgh; and the nation, under a wise monarch still in the prime of life, flour ishing at home and at peace abroad, looked forward to a long season of prosperity, when all its hopes were overcast in a moment rr \u2014 rr-] Alexander, when riding in a dark night, on the brink of a I dangerous rocky ledge near Kinghom, was precipitated ' \" 1 from the top to the bottom, and killed on the spot. 20. The death of the king was deeply lamented, and not without cause ; for he left the kingdom in most difficult circumstances, ex posed to the ambition and attacks of Edward the First, one of the ablest princes who had ever reigned in England, and dependent for its happiness at home upon the precarious life of an infant. To fill up the cup of Scotland's calamity, this child, Margaret, the Maiden of Norway, when on her passage from that countiy to take possession of the throne, died in Orkney ; and on her death arose that celebrated competition for the Scottish crown, which threatened to plunge the kingdom into all the miseries of civil war. 21. The moment was favourable to the designs of Edward the First, who determined to make himself master of Scotland. While in that country the various competitors collected their forces, aud prepared to support their claims, the English monarch having given orders for assembling the strength of his kingdom by a certain day, invited the nobility and clergy of Scotland to meet him at Norham, for the purpose of deliberating upon the succession to the crown. It has been made a subject of dispute, whether Edward was invited by the Scottish people to be umpire in the contest for the crown, or"], [50, "[A. D. 1291. 34 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. whether he proposed himself as judge ; and the subject is involved in 3ome obscurity. It is by no means improbable, that English in trigue and a regard to then- own interest, had induced some of the competitors, if not to invite, at least most readily to accept the me diation of the English monarch ; but there is no evidence to prove that there was any invitation of this kind, either by the people of Scotland, or even by a majority of its nobles and clergy. The me diation of Edward, however, was accepted by the competitors for the crown and a large proportion of the nobility and clergy of Scot land, and they accordingly met this monarch at Norham, (May 1291.) 22. Of the claimants for the crown the two principal were John Baliol and Robert Bruce. The title of these two chiefs arose out of the circumstance, that, on the death of all the descendants of Alex ander the Third, the crown reverted to the descendants of David, earl of Huntingdon, brother of king William the Lion. This David left three daughters, of whom Margaret the eldest married Alan, lord of Galloway, grandfather of Baliol ; and Isabella, the second, Ro bert Bruce, lord of Annandale, father of Brace the competitor. Ba liol pleaded that he was entitled to the crown as the descendant of the eldest daughter, being great-grandson to David, earl of Hunt ingdon. Bruce admitted that he sprung from the second daughter, but contended, that, being grandson of the earl of Huntingdon, and therefore a degree nearer, his claim was superior. 23. Edward's scheme against the independence of Scotland was now ripe for execution ; and, announcing his determination to give a just decision, he, to the dismay of many present, required the Scot tish barons to swear fealty to him as then- Lord Paramount. It was in this character alone, he said, that he was entitled to give, and as such alone that he would pronounce, a judgment. The scene which now ensued was a humiliating one. The right of Edward was admitted ; and Bruce and Baliol, the competitors, with the ba rons and the clergy, set their hands to an instrument, in which they acknowledged that the English king was feudal superior of Scotland. There can be little doubt that they knew this claim of Edward to be untenable upon any ground of truth or justice ; but they saw it ready to be enforced by a determined prince, at the head of the whole strength of his dominions, and they did not dare to resist it. Ed ward, accordingly, having received then oaths of homage, proceeded to investigate the contending claims, and awarded the crown to John Baliol. 24. It was probably part of the plan of the English monarch to quarrel with his vassal king. It is at least certain that he availed himself of the earliest appearance of spirit and resistance in this un fortunate prince to summon him, in terms of reproach and indignity,"], [51, "A. D. 1297.] SCOT0-SAXON PERIOD. 35 to his court in England, and at last goaded him and his people into what he termed rebellion. In the war which ensued, Edward found it an easy matter to overrun a kingdom unprepared to resist so for midable an enemy. The town of Berwick was canied by storm ; Dunbar, the key of the borders, sunendered ; Baliol was taken pri soner, and sent to the Tower ; while the English prince concluded what he deemed the conquest of Scotland, by removing from Scone to Westminster the sacred stone upon which the long line of its kings had been crowned and anointed. But at tins sad moment Scotland, which in vain looked for a deliverer amongst its feudal nobles, found one in a man of far inferior rank. 25. William Wallace was the son of Sir Malcolm Wallace, who held the estate of Ellerslie, near Paisley. Having been outlawed by the English for the slaughter of one of their adherents, by whom he had been grievously injured, he fled into the fastnesses of his countiy, and assembling round him a small band of followers, who were weary of their servitude, commenced that kind of predatory warfare, which led from one success to another, till he saw himself at the head of a formidable force. 26. Popular tradition, which delights to dwell with enthusiasm on the renowned champion of the people, describes Wallace as of un common stature and personal strength, daring coin-age and great militaiy genius ; and, making every allowance for the passionate admiration of his countrymen, and regarding him as reflected in the cold glass of history, rather than invested with the brilliant hues of romance, there will still be found all that constitutes a heroic charac ter, if the accomplishment of the greatest results with the most con fined means, an entire devotion to his countiy, a contempt of power for its own sake, unextinguishable hatred of oppression, and a per sonal coinage which nothing could for a moment shake, were ever entitled to such an epithet. 27. Sir William Douglas, the Steward of Scotland, his brother Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, and many other persons of distin guished rank, repaired to the standard of freedom and independence which AVallace had reared ; but on the approach of an English ar my, the greater number of these Scottish chiefs laid down their arms at Lwine, and made submission to Edward. Wallace, however, treated all proposals of submission with disdain. He was still at the head of a numerous and formidable force, composed partly of Ids own followers, and partly of the vassals even of the lords and knights who had abandoned then country's cause ; and, accompa nied by Sir Andrew Moray, who was the only baron that adhered to him, he retired indignantly to the north. (July 1297.) 28. For several months after the submission at Lwine, the Eng-"], [52, "36 [A D. 1297 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND !ish army seems to have remained in a state of inactivity. In the meanwhile, Wallace was continually receiving accessions to his for- ces ; and he succeeded in expelling the enemy from nearly all their strongholds on the north of the Forth, and was engaged in besieging the Castle of Dundee, when he received intelligence that the Eng- lish army was marching upon Stirling. Leaving the siege to be con- tinued by the citizens of Dundee, he led his whole force, with great expedition, towards Stirling, and succeeded in placing his army in a most favourable position before the English had reached the other side of the river. Wallace encamped on the high ground above Cainbuskenneth, on the northern side of the Forth, leaving Stirling Bridge apparently open to the enemy, but resolving to attack them while in the act of crossing. The Earl of Surrey, who commanded the Engbsh forces, perceiving the strength of the position occupied by the Scots, hesitated to attack them in such perilous circumstan- ces. But Cressingham the treasurer, an ignorant and presump- tuous ecclesiastic, murmured at the expense attending the war, and insisted that it was then- duty to fight, and put an end to it at once. SuiTey weakly yielded to this advice. On the morning of the 11th of September, the English army began to cross the bridge, a long narrow structure, where scarce two horsemen could ride abreast. When about one half were over, Wallace attacked them with great fury. In an instant all was tumult and confusion. Many thousands were cut to pieces, and great multitudes were drowned in making a vain attempt to reach the other side of the river. Cressingham himself was among the slain, and Surrey fled to Berwick without drawing bridle. The remains of the English army were driven out of Scotland ; and, in a brief period after this defeat, abnost all the fortresses of the kingdom surrendered to Wallace. The victorious general even led his forces across the English border, and laid waste Northumberland and Cumberland. 29. After his return from this successful foray, Wallace was cho sen governor of Scotland. This title he accepted only as acting in the name of John Baliol, whom he had always acknowledged as his hereditary king. It was, however, impossible for Wallace, with all his great qualities, to reconcile the Scottish nobles to his envied ele vation, or to compose the feuds and jealousies which divided and weakened their efforts. The lesser barons and gentiy, and especi ally the lower classes of the community, were devotedly attached to him ; but the great nobility were envious of his high military renown and great popularity, and then mean and selfish jealous}' prevented them from acting cordially with the only man whose talents were equal to the emergency. 30. Edward, who had been absent in Flanders when his officers"], [53, "A. D. 1298.] SCOTO-SAXON PERIOD. 37 were defeated at Stirling, hunled back to England, and once more invaded Scotland at the head of an immense army. Wallace, mean while, having collected his forces iu the interior of the country, acted with great sagacity. His plan, which often, before and after, proved successful in Scottish warfare, was to avoid a general engagement, and, driving off all supplies, and wasting the countiy through which the enemy were to march, to wait till the scarcity of provisions com pelled tnem to retreat, and then to attack them when their army should be exhausted by privation. The wisdom of the plan was veiy apparent, and for some time it was completely successful. Ed ward advanced as far as Kirkliston, in West Lothian, without re ceiving any intelligence of the invisible foe who wasted the country as he advanced. Difficulties thickened around him ; his fleet was detained by contrary winds ; his troops suffered severely from the scarcity of provisions ; and, to add to his perplexities, an alarming mutiny broke out in his camp. At this critical juncture, when Ed ward found himself compelled to issue orders for a retreat, he learned, through the treachery of two apostate Scottish nobles, the Earls of Dunbar and Angus, that the Scottish army was encamped not far off in the forest of Falkirk. The English monarch, on receiving this welcome intelligence, instantly broke up his camp, and advanced against his adversaries, whom he found posted on a stony field at the side of a small eminence, in the neighbourhood of Falkirk. Wal lace divided his infantry, which did not amount to the third part of the force of the English, into four divisions, armed with lances, (vhich the men protraded obliquely, as they knelt with their backs against each other, and having the appearance, says an English his torian, of a castle walled with steel. The archers under the com mand of Sir John Stewart were placed in the spaces between these divisions, and the horse, of which there were only a thousand, were drawn up at some distance in the rear. 31. The English began the battle. The Scottish spearmen gal lantly sustained the assault ; but the whole body of the horse, owing, it is supposed, to the treachery or ill-will of their leaders, shamelessly retired without striking a blow. The infantry, thus left without support, stood their ground firmly for some time against the repeated and destructive charges of the English horse, the lancers, and the archers, but were at length compelled to give way, and the rout became complete. This battle was fought on the 22d of July 1298. Wallace, with the remains of the Scottish army, made good his retreat, leaving nearly fifteen thousand men dead upon the field. 32. After this fatal defeat at Falkirk, Wallace voluntarily re signed the office of governor ; and Robert Bruce, John Comyn, John de Soulis, and William Lamberton, Bishop of St Andrews,"], [54, "[A. D. 1305. 38 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. were chosen guardians in his place. The war was continued for five years with various success. Edward, in the interval, thrice invaded the kingdom, but the Scots continued to offer a determined, aud, in some cases, successful resistance to his aims. On one occa sion, near Roslin (24th February 1303), a body of Scots, com manded by John Comyn, the guardian, and a gallant Scottish knight called Sir Simon Fraser, met and successively defeated three detachments of the English in one day. 33. Notwithstanding these successes, Edward, by his unceasing efforts, and superior numerical strength, at last subdued the spuit, aud appeared to have completed the conquest, of this devoted people. The guardians submitted, and were pardoned. Their example was followed by all the other Scottish barons. Even the brave Sir Simon Fraser, the stanch adherent of Wallace, ultimately aban doned the apparently hopeless contest ; and the great chief alone steadily refused submission to the usurped authority of the English king. He continued to maintain himself among the wilds of his native country for more than a year after all the other defenders of Scottish liberty had laid down their arms. But Edward pursued him with inveterate enmity, and employed every possible means to discover his retreat, and secure his person. A large sum was set upon his head, and he was at last basely betrayed to the English by Sir John Monteith, an apostate Scottish nobleman, who ob tained an opportunity of seizing him by the treachery of a servant. This gallant defender of his countiy was instantly earned to Lon don, where he was brought to trial in Westminster Hall. The studied insult and refined cruelty with which he was treated, reflect indelible disgrace on the character of the English monarch. He was crowned, in mockeiy, with a green garland ; and he was im peached as a traitor to the king of England, on the ground that he had stormed and taken the towns and castles, and slain the subjects of the king. Wallace answered, \"I could not be a traitor to Ed ward, for I never was his subject.\" But to the rest of the charges he offered no defence. He had fought against the subjects of the king merely because they were the oppressors of his countiy. The justice of this plea was unquestionable, but Wallace was neverthe less condemned to death. On the 23d of August 1305, this noble hero was dragged at the tails of horses through the streets to the place of execution, in Smithfield, and put to death with the most aggravated and atrocious cruelty. His head was then cut off, and his body divided into four quarters. The head was placed upon London Bridge, and his limbs were exposed at Newcastle, Berwick, Perth, and Aberdeen. 34. No doubt Edward hoped, that by exercising such honible"], [55, "A. D. 1306.] SCOTO-SAXON PERIOD. 39 barbarities towards the immortal supporter of the independence of Scotland, he would deter the rest of the Scottish patriots from offer ing any resistance to his usurped authority. But his short-sighted tyranny served only the more to endear the memory of Wallace to his countrymen, and to increase then- deep and unextinguishable hatred to a foreign yoke. Within six months of the death of Wal lace, the Scots were again up in arms, and a new deliverer arose in the person of Robert Brace. CHAPTER VI. A. D. 1306 to 1329. Robert Bruce.

Rhodes taken by the Knights of St John. 1. Robert Brace, Earl of Canlck, was the grandson of the com petitor for the crown. While Wallace, and the few patriotic barons who adhered to him, made their stand for the independence of their country, he had acted an equivocal and interested part. He inhented, with vast landed estates, the right to the crown pos sessed by his grandfather ; but, had he urged his claim, it might have been at the risk of the forfeiture of those possessions which made him one of the most powerful barons in Scotland. Hence, although in his early career we can detect occasional outbreaks of patriotic feeling, yet he preserved his allegiance to Edward the First, and appears to have been treated with confidence by that monarch. 2. The injuries inflicted on the country seem at last to have aroused both Brace and Comyn, and they formed a secret agree ment to rise against the English. But Comyn's courage failed. He betrayed the purpose to Edward ; and meeting Brace, who had been made aware of his treachery, in the church of the Greyfriars at Dumfries, that proud baron reviled him as an informer, and stabbed him to the heart on the steps of the high altar. Brace was"], [56, "40 [A. D. 1306. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. instantly proclaimed a traitor by Edward, excommunicated as a sa crilegious murderer by the Pope, and a price was set upon his head. In these circumstances, he felt that he must either assert his right to the crown, and trust to his sword for its defence, or be content to sink into the condition of an outlaw and a fugitive. His deci sion was instantly taken. He rode with his little band to Scone, and was there solemnly crowned ; but being aware of the advance of an English army, he hastily concentrated his forces, and, after ravaging Galloway, marched against Perth. 3. The Earl of Pembroke held Perth for King Edward, with an army which outnumbered that of the Scots by fifteen hundred men at-arms. Brace challenged the English commander to come forth and give him battle. Pembroke answered that he would fight him on the morrow. On this the Scots retired to the neighbouring wood of Methven, expecting no battle till next day. Pembroke, how ever, sallied out from Perth that same evening (19th June 1306), and fell upon the Scots, who were completely taken at unawares. They fought boldly, but were ultimately routed with great slaugh ter. Bruce himself was three times unhorsed, and with great diffi culty effected his escape into the wilds of Athole, with about five hundred men. From Athole, he retreated into Aberdeenshire, where he was joined by his queen and other ladies, determined to share in the perils of then husbands and fathers. Hitherto the fugi tives had experienced no opposition from the inhabitants of the vari ous districts through which they had wandered ; but the greater part of the shire of Argyle, which they iiow approached, was under the control of the Lord of Lorn, who had married an aunt of the mur dered Comyn, and was, therefore, a determined enemy of Brace. This powerful chief immediately collected his vassals, attacked the little band of Brace in a narrow defile, and, after a sharp encoun ter, in which the king performed prodigies of valour, compelled them to retreat. 4. This repulse greatly aggravated the difficulties under which Brace already laboured. The approach of winter compelled him to separate the ladies from his company ; and they were according ly sent, under the escort of his brother Nigel Bruce, to the strong castle of Kildrummie in Mar. Bruce himself, and a few of his adherents, found means to pass over to the little island of Rachrin, on the northern coast of Ireland, where he continued to lurk in con cealment dming the winter of 1306. 5. In the mean time, rain fell upon almost all the adherents and friends whom he had left behind. His queen and his daughter were forcibly taken from the sanctuary of St Duthac, at Tain, and committed to close confinement in England, where they remained"], [57, "A. D. 1307.] 41 ROBERT BRUCE for eight years. The Countess of Buchan, who had placed the crown upon Brace's head, was immured in a cage m one of the outer turrets of the castle of Berwick. Nigel Bruce, a beautiful and accomplished youth, after a gallant defence, was compelled to surrender the castle of Kildrummie ; and being sent in irons to Ber wick, was there executed as a traitor, along with divers other knights and soldiers. Sir Christopher Seton, who had married a sister of Bruce, the Earl of Athole, and the veteran Sir Simon Fraser, the last friend and follower of Wallace, were also taken and put to death, with circumstances of honible barbarity and cruelty. To add to the difficulties of his apparently hopeless con dition, a formal sentence of excommunication was at the time pro nounced by the papal legate against the Scottish king aud his ad herents. 6. On the approach of spring, Bruce passed over from Rachrin rr \u2014^r~i to the isle of Arran, and thence sent a messenger into his I ,oa7' own country of Carrick, to ascertain what were the fcel- 1_ ings of the people. It was agreed that, if they were fa vourably affected towards his cause, the messenger should Ught a fire, at a time appointed, upon the cape or headland beneath Turn berry Castle. At the appointed time, the anxiously expected bght appeared, and Bruce instantly embarked with his men, steering, as mght came on, by the light of the beacon. On reaching the land iug-place, Brace found his emissary waiting on the beach, to tell him that Lord Percy, with a numerous ganison, held the castle oi' Turnbeny, that the people were dispirited, and that there was no hope of success. \" Traitor,\" said Bruce, \" why, then, did you make the signal?\" \" I made no signal,\" replied the man, \" but observing a fire on the hill, I dreaded you might embark, and has tened to meet you.\" 7. Bruce hesitated what to do ; but his brother Edward declared boldly that no peril should induce him to reimbark ; and it was at last resolved to pursue the enterprise at all hazards. An immediate attack was made upon a body of the enemy who were quartered in the houses and hamlets round the castle of Turnbeny. The greater part were put to the sword, a rich booty was seemed, and Percy, ionorant of the number of the assailants, shut himself up in the castle, and did not venture to attempt a rescue. 8. After this adventure, Brace was speedily joined by fiiends and followers, till at length Percy found it necessary to evacuate Turn berry, and retreat into England. Sir James Douglas travelled in disguise into Douglasdale, and collecting some of his ancient retain ers, surprised the English garrison who held Douglas Castle, and nut them all to the sword. He then plundered the castle of all the 1 b2"], [58, "42 [A. D. 1307. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. arms and valuables which could be carried off, slew his prisoners, mingled their dead bodies with a large stock of provisions which he found in the stores, and finished by setting fire to the pile, and con suming it and his ancestral halls in the blaze. This cruel transac tion is remembered to this day in the traditions of the countiy by the name of the Douglas Larder. 9. The efforts of Bruce and his followers, however, were not al ways crowned with success. Two of his brothers, Thomas and Alexander, who had gone to Leland, for the purpose of procuring reinforcements, landed in Galloway with a force of seven hundred men which they had collected ; but they were attacked and defeated by Macdowall, a chief of that country, who was in the English in terest. The two brothers, with Sir Reginald Crawford, were se verely wounded, and taken prisoners. Macdowall carried them, bleeding and almost dead, to Edward at Carlisle, who commanded them to be instantly executed. 10. For some time after this disaster, Brace was in great difficul ties, and on several occasions narrowly escaped being taken prisoner by his enemies. But although often repulsed, he and his followers gained experience and confidence from the various enterprises hi which they engaged ; and at length he ventured, although at the head of only six hundred spearmen, to meet his old enemy the Earl of Pembroke, with three thousand cavahy, at Loudon Hill (May 10, 1307). The result of this conflict, owing to the admirable disposi tions of Bruce, was the entire defeat of the English ; and from this point \u2014 the crisis of his fortune, to the horn- when the liberty of his country was for ever secured on the field of Bannockbnrn, the ca reer of this extraordinary man presented an almost continued series of success. 11. The repeated reverses which his troops had met with greatly incensed the English monarch. Although old and worn out by ill ness, he resolved to march in person against his enemies, and to take vengeance upon them for their insubordination. With this view he placed himself at the head of an army, and marched towards Scotland, though he was so weak that he required to be supported in the saddle. But the effort was vain. He only reached the vil lage of Burgh-upon-Sands, in Cumberland, where he expired on the 7th of July 1307. It is said, that on his deathbed he made his son promise never to make peace with Scotland until the nation was subdued ; and commanded that his body should be boiled in a caul dron till the flesh was separated from the bones, and that the bones should be canied at the head of the English army as often as the Scots rose in rebellion. 12. It was, no doubt, fortunate for Scotland, that Edward the Se-"], [59, "A. D. 1307.] ROBERT BRUCE. 43 cond, who now ascended the English throne, was a prince of far in ferior talents to his father. Yet the military resources of England were so formidable, and the barons who commanded them such ex perienced leaders, that Bruce, who had to struggle against domestic enemies as well as foreign invasion, may well be praised for the ad mirable judgment with which he wielded the strength of his little kingdom. It was his pobcy to avoid a general battle, and to starve and distress the formidable armies which England repeatedly sent against him, by wasting the countiy, retiring slowly before his ene mies into the woods and fastnesses, aud, when they were compelled by famine or the season to retreat, hanging on their rear, and cut ting them off in detail. Convinced that, from the poverty of Scot land, it was in vain to attempt to rival the moimted chivalry of England, he turned his whole attention to the formation and disci pline of his infantry. They were armed with a spear eighteen feet in length, a sword and battle-axe at their girdle, a short cut-and thrust dagger, a steel bonnet, and a back and breast-piece budded over a tough leather jerkin. They were trained to form sometimes in squares, sometimes in circles, more or less deep, according to the nature of the ground and of the service. Such were the pikemen who composed the main anny of Brace ; but after he had restored peace and security to his kingdom, and began in his turn to act upon the offensive, he often employed the only kind of cavalry which Scotland could raise, the border prickers, who, lightly armed, mounted on hardy little horses, and canying as their provisions a bag of meal slung at their saddle-bow, darted upon the richest dis tricts of England, stripped them of their wealth, and scoured like a whirlwind across the border, ere the force of the country coidd be raised in its defence. 13. The contest which the heroic monarch carried on with Eng land, in defence of the independence of his country, was long and obstinate. During the first years it was a war of defence, in whicli Bruce straggled for existence. This secured, the war became ag gressive ; but his efforts were confined to the recovery of his domin ions out of the hands of those Scottish barons who had embraced the service of the enemy, or of his castles from the English gover nors to whom they had been entrusted. His success in these efforts was uniform and steady. The strong castles of Dumfries, Rox burgh, and Edinburgh ; those of Butel in Galloway, and Dalswinton in Dumfriesshire, the former a seat of the Baliols, the latter of the Comyns ; the town of Perth and the fortresses of Dundee and Rutherglen, and various other strongholds, one by one fell into his hands. Buchan, the territory of his mortal enemies the Comyns, was wasted with fire and sword, in revenge for an attack which"], [60, "44 [A. D. 1307. HISTOEY OF SCOTLAND. Comyn Earl of Buchan made upon the king at Old Meldram ; and so severely was the country ravaged that the \" harrying of Buchan\" was the subject of lamentation for fifty years after, and traces of the devastation may even yet be seen. Galloway, the turbulent inha bitants of which had always been hostile to the family of Brace, and had on various occasions reduced the king to great straits, was brought into subjection by Edward Bruce ; while Robert in person avenged upon the country of Lorn in Argyleshire the defeat which he had sustained from its chief shortly after the battle of Methven. The victorious monarch even made several incursions into England, and led back his army in triumph, laden with spoil. Meanwhile, the measures of the English government were characterized by weakness, vacillation, and uncertainty. In less than a year com missions were granted to six different governors in Scotland, and re called before those appointed had time to act upon them. Orders for the muster of the royal army were obeyed or neglected by the English barons at their pleasure. Preparations were made to cany on the war vigorously, and in a short time were laid aside, and di rections given to the English governors in Scotland to conclude, and, in some cases, even to purchase, a trace. Such a fluctuating and capricious line of policy proved, as might have been expected, completely unsuccessful. The Scots continued steadily to gain ground. Four expeditions were successively undertaken against them by Edward himself or his generals, but without producing any permanent effect ; and, at length, the castle of Stirling was almost the only considerable place of strength in Scotland that still remained in the possession of the English. 14. This important fortress had been besieged by Edward Bruce, and gallantly defended by Sir Philip de Mowbray, the governor. At length the garrison, becoming straitened for provisions, agreed to surrender if not relieved by the feast of St John the Baptist in the following year (24th June 1314). The king was greatly dis pleased with the rashness of his brother in entering into such an en gagement ; but, disdaining to imitate the conduct of Edward, who in a former year had violated a treaty made in circumstances pre cisely similar, he resolved at all hazards to abide by the truce. 15. No sooner did the news of the treaty reach the English court than preparations began to be made on the most gigantic scale for the effort which it was felt that the occasion demanded. Edward summoned the whole military array of the kingdom to meet him at Berwick on the 11th of June. That day, accordingly, saw assem bled at the place of rendezvous indisputably the most numerous and best appointed army that an English monarch ever led against Scot land, amounting in all to upwards of one hundred thousand men,"], [61, "A. D. 1314.] 45 ROBERT BRUCE. including a body of forty thousand cavalry and fifty thousand arch ers. At the head of this mighty array Edward took bis course mto Scotland and advanced towards Stirling. Bruce, meanwhile, had appointed a general muster of his forces in the Torwood near Stir ling. They amounted to less than forty thousand men, of whom only five hundred were cavalry. On the approach of the Engbsh, Bruce drew up his army to the south of Stirling, in a field which was then called the New Park. The ground was partly open, partly encumbered with trees, and the approach to it was protected by a dangerous morass. The Scottish line of battle extended from south to north, and fronted the east or south-east. The right wing rested on a brook called Bannockburn, whose broken wooded banks effec tually secured the flank from the assault of the enemy. The left wing extended toward the town of Stilling, and was protected by rows of pits three feet deep, with sharp stakes driven into them, and the apertures carefully covered with sod. It does not appear, how ever, that the Engbsh cavalry made any attempt to charge over this ground. The right wing was commanded by Edward Brace, the left by James Douglas and Walter the Steward of Scotland ; Thomas Randolph, the lung's nephew, led the central division. The king himself commanded the reserve, which consisted of Ids own vassals of Carrick, and the men of the isles, and of Argyle and Kentire. The followers of the camp were stationed with the bag gage behind an eminence to the rear of the Scottish army, which is still called the GilUes' (or servants') hill. 16. On the morning of Sunday, June 23d, the Scottish soldiers heard mass, and confessed themselves with the solemnity of men who were resolved to Uberate their countiy, or perish in the attempt. The king then proceeded to draw up his troops in battle arcay, and Ids anangements were hardly completed when it was announced that the enemy were at hand. On approaching Stirling, Edward detached a body of eight hundred horse under Sir Robert Clifford, with orders to turn the left flank of the Scottish army, and tlirow themselves into Stirling castle. But the movement was detected by Brace himself; and Randolph, who had been instructed to be vigilant in repelling any such attempt, hastened to throw himself between the English detachment and the castle. A brief but stub born conflict ensued, which terminated in the total defeat of Clif ford's squadron. 17. While this affair was yet undecided, the vanguard of the English army, led by the Earls of Gloucester and Hereford, entered the New Park, in which the Scots were drawn up. Bruce was at the moment engaged in marshalling his line, mounted on a small palfrey, but clad in complete annour, with his battle-axe in his hand."], [62, "46 [A. D. 1314. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and distinguished by a golden coronet which he wore on his helmet, when an English knight, Sir Hemy de Bohun, armed at all points, and mounted on a heavy war-horse, recognised the king, and gal loped forward to attack him. The contest was most unequal ; but Bruce, instead of retiring from it, coolly awaited the onset, till his assailant was close upon him, when, suddenly moving his palfrey to one side, he struck the English knight as he passed him in his ca reer, and, with one blow of his battle-axe, laid him dead at his feet. The result of these two attacks greatly animated the Scots, and struck dismay into their enemies. The Engbsh vanguard retreated in confusion to the main army, and Edward and his barons resolveo to delay the battle till the mon'ow. 18. On Monday, the 24th of June 1314, at the first break of day, the Scottish king confessed, and, along with his army, heard mass performed by the Abbot of Inchatfray in front of the Une. After the conclusion of this solemn service, the soldiers breakfasted, and arranged themselves under their different banners. The an-ange ments were scarcely concluded, when the vanguard of the English advanced to the attack, under the command of the Earls of Glou cester and Hereford. At a Mttle distance behind came the remain der of the army, consisting of nine separate divisions, led by Edward in person, attended by a body-guard of five hundred choice men-at arms. At this moment, the Abbot of Inchaffray, bareheaded ana barefooted, walked along the Scottish line, and, holding a cracifix aloft, bestowed his benediction on the soldiers, who knelt to receive it. \" See,\" cried Edward, \" they are kneebng \u2014 they ask mercy.\" \" They do, my Uege,\" repbed Sir Ingram Umfraville, an Anglicised Scottish baron, who rode beside him ; \" but it is from God, not from us. On that field they will win or die.\" \" Be it so, then,\" said the king, and immediately commanded the charge to be sound ed, and the attack to take place. 19. The Engbsh van, led by the Earls of Gloucester and Here ford, advanced at full gallop on the right wing of the Scots, but were unable to force the deep ranks of the spearmen, who stood firm in their an-ay, presenting a serried front of steel, on which the im petuous charges of the enemy scarcely produced any hnpression. The centre and left wing of the Scottish army also came up, and attacked the English infantiy ; and thus the battle became general along the whole length of the front bne. The archers, by whom the attack of the cavalry was supported, began to do great execu tion on the ranks of the Scottish speannen, but were assaulted in the flank, and completely broken by Sir Robert Keith, the marshal of Scotland, at the head of a small detachment of horse which had been kept in reserve for the purpose"], [63, "SCENE AT BATTLE OF BANNOCKBURN. a.d. 1314.

The battle continued to rage with great fury, but Brace, per ceiving symptoms of exhaustion in the ranks of his enemies, pressed vigorously upon the confused and already wavering mass of the English. At this critical moment, when the fortune of the day still hung in the balance, the followers of the Scottish camp, prompted either by the enthusiasm of the moment, or the desire of plunder, suddenly appeared on the Gilhes' hill, in the rear of the Scottish army ; and having hastily assumed such arms as they found near est, and fastened sheets and horse cloths upon poles for ensigns, they presented the appearance of a new army advancing to battle. This unexpected sight spread instant dismay amidst the ranks of the English ; at the same moment, King Robert, raising his war-cry, pressed with redoubled fury on the enemy. This onset decided the fate of the day. The English fled in every direction, and were pursued with immense slaughter. Thirty thousand were left dead upon the field, amongst whom were twenty-seven barons, two hun dred knights, and seven hundred esquires. The loss on the side of the Scots was very small, and Sir Wilham Vipont and Sir Walter Ross were the only persons of note among the slain. The Engbsh monarch himself escaped with difficulty, and, after a rapid and con tinued flight of sixty miles, during which he was closely pursued by Douglas, he at length found refuge in the castle of Dunbar, from which he passed by sea to Berwick. An immense quantity of spoil, and many prisoners of rank, feU into the hands of the victors ; and, according to an English historian, \" the chariots, waggons, and wheeled carriages which were loaded with the baggage and military stores would, if drawn up in a fine, have extended for twenty leagues.\" 21. In this memorable victory, it may be said, without exagge ration, that a lesson in the history of bberty was taught, not only to Scotland, but to the world ; to every people who have felt the misery of servitude, or tasted the sweets of freedom. It proved that a country may be, as Scotland was under Edward the First, brought by oppression and cruelty to the very brink of despair ; its cities sacked, its fields laid waste, till famine be the consequence ; its best leaders executed or imprisoned, its hearths left desolate, its veiy offerings of praise proscribed, and its refuge in reUgion at tempted to be cut off ; but that, till exterminated, a free-born peo ple cannot be said to be subdued. 22. The immediate effects of this great victory upon the spbit of the respective countries were not less remarkable. It convinced the Scots, that, with a good heart and skilful leaders, their squares of infantry, with their long pikes, were a match for the Engbsh horse, however superior in arms and numbers ; it taught the king,"], [66, "[A. D. 1315. 48 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. that what he had most to dread was the discharge of the English bowmen ; and it admonished him, that, however complete had been the defeat, however glorious the consequences of the victor)', his favourite military maxim, to avoid a general battle, was still his best and safest course. It affords a striking view of the character of this great man, that his success at Bannockburn led neither to presumption, nor, much as he had suffered, and deeply as he had been injured in his tenderest relations, to a cruel retaliation. On the contrary, it was followed up by Brace with an immediate pro posal for peace ; but as he would consent to treat only on the foot ing of an independent king, the offer was rejected. 23. From 1314 to 1328, the war was continued with almost un intemipted success on the part of the Scots ; while a series of re verses were endured by England, which are chiefly to be ascribed to the pusillanimous character of the monarch, and the great mib tary ability not only of Brace, but of the officers whom he had trained, Sir James Douglas, Randolph Earl of Moray, the young Steward of Scotland, and many others. It may convey some idea of Brace's incessant occupation in the field, when it is mentioned, that, during this interval, England was twelve times invaded, eithei by the king in person, or by his officers, that its border counties were exposed to continual ravages, and that, on frequent occasions, the fires which marked the Scottish march were seen burning al most to the gates of York. So great was the terror of his arms, that the northern districts of England were compelled to purchase safety by the payment of a heavy tribute, and they even threatened in their misery to throw themselves into the arms of Scotland. 24. On the 26th of April 1315, the Estates of Scotland, in a par liament held at Ayr, passed a solemn act of settlement respecting the succession of the crown. It was determined, with the consent of King Robert, and of his only child Marjory, that, in the event of a y. I the king's death without male issue, his brother Edward ,\u201e'.,.' | should ascend the throne, and, faibng Edward and his heirs- II male, that the crown should descend to Marjory and her descendants. This princess was shortly after married to Walter, the hereditary High Steward of Scotland ; and the descendant of that auspicious maniage now sits upon the throne of the United Kingdom. 25. About this period a party of Irish chieftains, discontented with the Engbsh yoke, sent over an invitation to Edward Bruce to assume the sceptre of Leland, and assist them to expel the Engbsh from that country. Edward, accordingly, with an army of six thousand men, landed at Carrickfergus on the 25th of May 1315, and, after a series of brilliant successes, was crowned king of Ire \u2022"], [67, "A. D. 1318.] ROBERT BRUCE. 49 land on the 2d of May 1316. He was shortly after joined by King Robert himself with a considerable body of troops, by whose assis tance he was enabled to overran a great part of Leland, but with out gaining any permanent advantage. The Scottish king was soon obbged to return to his own dominions, and, after his departure his brother Edward Bruce having rashly encountered an Anglo-Irish army ten times more numerous than his own, was defeated and slain, 5th October 1318. 26. The Engbsh had taken advantage of the absence of Robert Brace to make several incursions into his dominions, but they were as often repeUed by the activity and mibtary enterprise of Sir James Douglas and the Steward, to whom the king had entrusted the go vernment of the countiy. Having failed in his attempts by land, the Engbsh monarch fitted out a naval armament, and, sailing into the Ffrth of Forth, disembarked a considerable body of troops at Donnibrissle, on the coast of Fife. The sheriff of the county col lected a force of five hundred cavalry to resist the invader ; but they, thinking the enemy too strong for them, took to flight. For tunately, however, the fugitives were met by WUbam Sinclafr, bishop of Dunkeld, who resided near the coast. \" Out upon you for false knights, whose spurs should be stricken from youi' heels,\" said the gabant prelate. Then seizing a spear from the nearest soldier, he exclaimed, \" Let ab who love Scotland foUow me.\" With this he made a desperate charge upon the Engbsh, who were driven back to their ships with great loss. When the king heard of this exploit, he declared that Sinclafr should hereafter be his own bishop ; and in memory of Brace's expression, the vabant prelate was ever after denominated the \" King's Bishop.\" 27. The king of England, unable to cany on the war with suc cess, and yet unwilling to purchase peace by agreeing to the terms on which alone it could be procured, had recourse to the interven tion of the Pope, and, by the liberal use of Engbsh gold, induced that pontiff to issue a bull commanding a two years' truce between England and Scotland. But as the Pope withheld from Brace the title of king, the Scottish monarch refused to enter into any nego tiation, or to admit the papal legates to an interview ; and, when the truce was proclaimed, he declined paying any regard to it. 28. On the 28th of March 1318, the important town of Berwick feb into the hands of the Scots through the treachery of a burgess named Spalding, who had been disgusted at the severity of the English governor. The castle also soon after surrendered to Brace, who, aware of the vast importance of the acquisition, caused the place to be fuhy victuaUed and strongly garrisoned, and committed the keeping of it to his brave son-in-law, the High Steward of c"], [68, "50 [A. D. 1319. HISTORY OF SCOTLAN I \u2014i Scotland. These successes were fobowed up by two inva- I ' ' sions of England, from both of which the Scots returned |jf __J laden with booty, and, according to an ancient Engbsh chro nicle, driving their prisoners before them like flocks of sheep. Mean while the death of Edward Bruce, and of the Princess Marjory, hav ing rendered some new regulations necessary respecting the succes sion to the throne, a parliament was held at Scone in December 1318, in which Robert Stewart, the infant son of the Princess Mar jory and her husband, the Steward of Scotland, was proclaimed heir to the crown, in the event of the king's death without male issue. 29. In the summer of 1319, King Edward, stung with resentment at the loss of Berwick, determined to make a vigorous effort to re cover that important town. He accordingly invested the place with a mighty army, and assaulted it by both land and sea. The garri son, however, under the command of the Steward of Scotland, made a gallant defence ; and, after a fierce and protracted struggle, suc ceeded in repulsing the assailants at ab points. In the mean time, Bruce determined to rebeve the town by making such a powerful diversion as shoidd compel the besieging army to come to the de fence of then- own countiy. With this view, Randolph and Douglas, at the head of a force of fifteen thousand men, entered England by the western borders, and made a rapid and sudden march towards York, for the purpose of seizing the person of Edward's queen, who had taken up her quarters near that city. A Scottish prisoner, who feb mto the hands of the English, betrayed then- scheme, just in time to prevent its success ; and the Scots, enraged at the disap pointment, proceeded, as usual, to lay waste the surrounding country with fire and sword. On the 28th of September, they were encoun tered at Mitton, on the Swale, by a very numerous but motley and undiscipbned army, under the command of the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Ely. The Engbsh were in a few minutes entfrely routed. About four thousand were left dead on the field, including three hundred ecclesiastics, wearing their surphces over their ar mour. In aUusion to this circumstance, and to the clerical charac ter of the Engbsh leaders, this battle was designated, in the savage pleasantly of the times, \" the Chapter of Mitton.\" The news of this disaster caused Edward immediately to raise the siege of Ber wick ; and, on the 21st of December following, a truce for two years was concluded between the kingdoms. 30. But, though the English monarch found himself unable to make any impression with temporal weapons, he endeavoured to cany on a spbitual war against Brace, through the intervention of his old ally the Pope. The holy father, instead of acting in the cha racter of a peacemaker, seized this moment to renew the thunders"], [69, "A. D. 1320.] ROBERT BRUCE. 51 of his excommunication against the Scottish king and his adherents ; and, enraged at the contempt with which his former censures had been treated, he commanded the prelates of York and London to repeat the ceremony on every Sabbath and festival day throughout the year. This conduct seems to have excited great bidignatiou among the people of Scotland. In a parliament, held at Aberbro- . \u201e thock on the 6th of AprU 1320, eight earls and thirty-one ' ' barons, among whom we find the great officers of the crown, '_ with the consent of the king, and in the name of the whole community of Scotland, appended their names and seals to a spi rited memorial to the Pope, in vindication of themselves and their sovereign. In this memorable document, they reprobated the un just interference of Edward the Ffrst with the affairs of Scotland, described, in forcible terms, the calamities which his ambition had brought upon that countiy, and testified their determined resolu tion to fight for bberty, as dearer to them than life. The Pope was reminded of his duty to preserve a general peace throughout Christ endom, and humbly entreated, as the vicegerent of Him with whom there is no respect of persons, to admonish the king of England to be content with what he possessed, and not to disturb the peace of a country whose inhabitants desired nothing but what was their own : and the memorial concluded with a solemn declaration, that, if his holiness should, after this explanation, favour the Engbsh in their schemes for the oppression of Scotland, at his charge must be ab that loss of life, that destruction of human souls, and those va rious calamities, which such a warfare must necessarily produce. In consequence of this remonstrance, the Pope was induced to sus pend, for a time, his hostility to Scotland, and earnestly to recom mend a peace between the two countries. A meeting was accord ingly held between certain English and Scottish commissioners, for the purpose of negotiating the terms of a peace ; but no agreement could be come to on the subject. 31. About this period, a formidable conspiracy against the life of King Robert was discovered by the confession of the Countess of Strathern, to whom the secret had been entrusted. William de Soulis, hereditary butler of Scotland, and grandson of Nicholas de Soulis, who had been a competitor for the crown along with Brace and Babol : Sir David de Brechin, nephew to the king, with five other knights, and three esquires, were the persons impbcated in this guilty transaction. Their intention seems to have been to put the king to death, and to place Lord Soulis on the throne. It is now known that both Soulis and Brechin had long been in the Eng lish interest, and had been pensioned for their services. The con spirators were brought to trial at a meeting of parbament held at"], [70, "[A. D. 1322. 52 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Scone, in the beginning of August 1320. Sfr David de Brechin and three of his accomplices were condemned to death and execut ed ; and Soulis and the Countess of Strathern were punished by per petual imprisonment. Notwithstanding the atrocity of their crimes, the punishment of these traitors seems to have been generaby re garded as severe ; and the parbament by which they were condemn ed, was long remembered under the name of the Black Parbament. 32. Some time after this, Edward obtained a complete triumph over the earls of Lancaster and Hereford, and others of his discon tented nobles ; and, encouraged by this transient gleam of success, he made extensive preparations for another invasion of Scotland, and wrote to the Pope, requesting him to give himself no further trouble about a truce with the Scots, since he had determined to bring them to reason by force of arms. Before his preparations could be completed, however, a Scottish army, led by Bruce in per son, broke into England, and laying waste the northern counties with fire and sword, returned laden with an immense booty. Mean while the Engbsh monarch continued his levies, and, in August 1322, invaded Scotland, at the head of an army of a hundred thou sand men. Bruce, with his usual policy, evaded a battle, content ing himself with laying waste the countiy as the enemy advanced, and removing to the mountains ab the cattle and other valuable ef fects. Accordingly, on entering Scotland, the Engbsh found them selves marching through a scene of desolation, where there was no enemy to encounter, and where no provisions of any kind could be obtained. They reached Edinburgh without opposition ; but, after suffering severely from famine, they were compebed to retreat with out having seen the enemy, the Scots hanging upon then rear dur ing thefr march homewards, and putting every straggler to the sword. On regaining their own countiy, they indulged so intemperately, after the privations they had endured, that sixteen thousand of them were cut off by dysentery, and immense numbers had then consti tutions rained for life. 33. Brace lost no time in retaliating the invasion of the Engbsh, and, leading an army across the Tweed, made an attempt upon Nor ham castle, in which, however, he was unsuccessful. But having learned that Edward lay encamped, with the remnant of his host, at Biland Abbey, near Malton, in Yorkshire, the Scottish king, by a forced march, suddenly appeared in front of the Engbsh host. It was no easy matter, however, to attack them, for they were strong ly posted on the ridge of a rugged and steep declivity, accessible only by a narrow and difficult pass. Douglas and Randolph at tempted to stomi this pass, but met with a desperate resistance from the English. While the battle was raging, Bruce commanded"], [71, "A. D. 1327.J 53 ROBERT BRUCE. a body of Highlanders to climb the ridge at a distance from the scene of action, and to attack the flank and rear of the enemy. Tins man\u0153uvre was attended with complete success ; and the Eng lish were entfrely routed and put to flight. Many prisoners of dis tinction, and an immense booty, feb into the hands of the victors, and Edward himself with difficulty escaped to Eridlington, leaving behind him his equipage, baggage, and treasure. The Scots then laid waste the whole countiy north of the Humber, and once more returned home in safety, loaded with spoil. 34. These successive disasters, together with the divided state of \". y. I his own kingdom, made the Engbsh monarch anxious for a ' ' cessation of hostilities, and soon after (March 30, 1323) a '_ thfrteen years' trace was concluded by the mediation of Henry de Srdly, grand butler of France, who had been taken pri- soner by the Scots at the battle of Biland Abbey. But Edward's conduct was marked by dissimulation and bad faith. He endea- voured, in various ways, to excite disturbances in Scotland, and la- boured to inflame the mind of the Pope against the Scottish' king. To counteract these insidious designs, Brace despatched to Rome his nephew Randolph, who conducted this difficult negotiation with such address, that the pontiff was induced to address a bull to Bruce under the title of King. While this affair was pending, a son was born to King Robert (1324), who afterwards succeeded his father, under the title of David H. But the joy of the country at this happy event was greatly overcast by the death of the king's son-in- law, the High Steward of Scotland. He stood deservedly high among the Scottish champions of that period, and seems to have been universally and deeply lamented. Shortly after this, a parba- ment was held at Cambuskenneth (July 1326), in which oaths of fealty were taken to the infant prince, David, and, faibng him or his heirs, to Robert Stewart, the king's grandson. It is worthy of notice, that, on this occasion, the representatives of the royal burghs appear, for the first time, to have been recognised as form- ing a third estate in the national parbament, \u2014 a sure sign of the in- creasing importance of the cities and towns. 35. In the year 1327, the weak and unfortunate Edward H. was deposed, and his son, Edward HI., then a youth of four- ' ' teen, caned to the throne. The council of regency, who 1327. carrjefj on the government during the mbiority of the king, while professing the most pacific intentions, acted towards Bruce in an insidious and hostUe manner ; and he, on his part, disgusted by repeated instances of bad faith on the part of the English govern ment, declared his resolution to renew the war, unless a lasting peace were speedily concluded. The Engbsh, however, had no such"], [72, "54 [A. D. 1328. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. intention, and warlike preparations were made on both sides to bring matters to a decisive conclusion. Edward convened a magnificent host at York, for the purpose of invading Scotland ; but, before he could put his army in motion, he received information that the Scots, under Randolph and Douglas, had broken into England by the western border, and were laying waste the whole country with fire and sword. The Engbsh immediately advanced to meet the enemy, but could learn no tidings of them till they entered Nor thumberland, where they perceived melancholy proofs of then pre sence in the smoke and flames of the vibages and hamlets, which the invaders had burnt in then progress. After a fruitless and fa tiguing pursuit of three days through a country which had been ren dered a blackened and smoking desert, the Engbsh, in despafr of overtaking their nimble enemies, marched back to the Tyne, in the hope of being able to cut off the retreat of the Scots into then own country. But, after halting on the banks of this river for eight days, during which they suffered the severest hardships from the want of shelter and provisions, they set out again in quest of the Scottish army. Iu this perplexing situation, Edward ordered a large reward to be offered to any man who should bring him certain information of the place where he might find the enemy. On the 31st of July, the reward was claimed by Thomas de Rokeby, who had faben into the hands of the Scots, and had been dismissed by their leaders, with orders to bring the Engbsh army to the spot where they were encamped. But, on reachbig the place, they found the Scots drawn up in an impregnable position, on the crest of a steep nib, at the foot of which ran the river Wear. The two armies continued facing each other for several days, but, on the fourth morning, the camp of the Scots was found deserted and empty. They had secretly decamped during the night, and had taken up a new position on the Wear, even stronger than the former, and masked by a wood, which enabled them to conceal then operations. The English also moved then- encampment, and took up a position on a hib opposite the Scots, so that the two armies continued to confront each other as before. On the second night after their ar rival, Douglas passed the river at midnight with a body of horse, broke into the enemy's camp, penetrated to the royal tent, and would have earned off the young king, but for the brave resistance of the chaplain and others of the household, who feb in then mas ter's defence, and thus gave him time to escape. Being thus disap pointed in his attempt on the king's person, Douglas cut his way through the gathering crowds of his enemies, and returned in safety to the Scottish camp. On the second night after this exploit, the Scottish army broke up then encampment at midnight, and, retreat-"], [73, "A. D. 1329.] ROBERT BRUCE. 55 mg through a morass in then- rear which had been judged impass able, had advanced several mUes on their way homewards before the English were aware that they had quitted their position. Deep ly mortified at the disastrous termination of this expedition, Ed ward returned to York, and disbanded his army. 36. The Engbsh were at length convinced that ab attempts to ob tain ascendency over the Scottish people must prove abortive ; and the exhaustion of the public treasury, and the desolated condition of their country, made them desirous of a lasting peace, the preli minaries of which were adjusted in a parbament held at York on the 1st of March 1328. It was agreed that the Engbsh monarch should renounce, fuby and for ever, ab claims of dominion and superiority over Scotland, \u2014 that all the charters and documents canied away by Edward the First should be restored, \u2014 that the kingdom should be secured to Brace and Iris hens, as it had existed in the reign of Alexander the Third, \u2014 and that there should be a perpetual peace between the two kingdoms, \u2014 for the confirmation of which a marriage was agreed upon between the princess Joanna, sister to the English monarch, and David, son of Robert Brace. This important treaty was concluded at Edniburgh on the 17th of March, and ratified in a parliament held at Northampton on the 4th of May 1328. In the month of July fobowing, the proposed mar riage between the princess Joanna and David was celebrated at Berwick with great magnificence. By this wise and just measure Scotland was at length recognised as a free and independent king \u2022 dom, and a glorious peace established, after a sanguinary war of thirty-two years' duration. 37. This great consummation was not long survived by him to j~ IT- whom, under God, the result was chiefly due. The king, i qoq wh\u00b0se constitution had been broken by the fatignes and ex 1 posure of his early life, began to droop soon after he saw the bberty of his country permanently established ; and he died at Cardross on the 7th of June 1329, in the fifty-fifth year of his age. His body was buried under the pavement of the choir in the Abbey Church of Dunfermline. After the king's death, his brave compa nion in arms, Sfr James Douglas, in obedience to bis dying com mands, proceeded to carry his master's heart to Jerusalem, for the purpose of interring it in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre ; but, having landed at Sevibe in his voyage, he was slam in an engage ment with the Moors.

Law pleadings in England changed from French to English. 1. The death of Brace was a severe trial to Scotland. His only son David, who succeeded him, was a boy under six years of age ; and, while the nation was thus exposed to ab the evils of a long minority, Edward the Third, one of England's most warlike mo narchs, was just commencing his career, which soon developed un common talents and great ambition. Randolph, indeed, who was chosen regent, and several other veteran officers stib remained ; but, as has just been stated, Douglas was slam in Spain in the fol lowing year, and the Earl of Moray survived the death of Bruce only for three years. To add to these calamities, the monarchs who suc cessively filled the Scottish throne, and on whose personal charac ter, in these rude times, much of the vigour and success of the go vernment depended, feb far short of their great predecessor. From the death of Brace tbl the reign of James the Fnst, the first prince who in any measure was worthy of a comparison with him, a period of nearly a century elapsed, in which the sceptre passed into the hands of three princes, David the Second, Robert the Second, and Robert the Third. Contemporary with these Scottish princes, were Edward the Thud, Richard the Second, Henry the Fourth, and Hemy the Fifth, all, with the exception of Richard, wise, war like, and fortunate monarchs. The odds, therefore, were infinitely against Scotland, a countiy far inferior to England in its popidation and resources, and torn by domestic feuds : aud yet, against reite rated attacks, it maintained the contest for its freedom. During tho calamitous period which elapsed between the death of Robert Brace and the bfrth of James the First, the country was eight times in vaded by a foreign force ; it was betrayed and deserted by David the Second, the unworthy son and successor of Bruce ; it saw, on"], [75, "A. D. 1332.] DAVID II. 57 many occasions, the most powerful of its nobles enbsted under the banner of its enemies ; it had to straggle against the military genius and pobtieal talents of Edward the Third, Hemy the Fourth, and Hemy the Fifth ; and yet, with bruited resources, and divided councils, so tenaciously did the people cling to thefr bberty, that, though sore oppressed, they were never conquered. Amid almost constant war, and its dreadful accompaniments, famine and pesti lence, they stib preserved their freedom, preferring the prospect of bving in a country, reduced, by repeated invasion, to a sobtude or a desert, or even the last alternative of being totaby exterminated, to the most flattering offers of being united to England, when cou pled with the condition that they shoidd renounce then national independence. 2. The reign of David Brace, which extended to the long period of forty-two years, was divided into a minority, the greater part of which was passed in France, a captivity in England, the result of his calamitous defeat in the battle of Durham, and a train of sub sequent reverses, ab occasioned by bis headstrong character and devotion to selfish pleasures. David was bttle more than five years of age when he succeeded his father in 1329 : he was not crowned tUl the 24th of November 1331. The veteran Randolph Earl of Moray, as has been already mentioned, was appointed regent du ring his minority, and conducted the affairs of the countiy with great prudence and decision. 3. In no long time, however, the tranquillity of the kingdom be gan to be seriously menaced. By an article in the treaty of North ampton, it was stipulated that three powerful Engbsh barons. Henry Percy, Thomas Lord Wake, and Hemy Beaumont, should be re stored to those Scottish estates which bad been forfeited during the wars of King Robert Bruce. Of the three, Percy alone had been restored. The regent delayed the performance of the stipulation respecting the others, on the ground that they had declared them selves enemies to Scotland, and were at that very time instigating Edward Babol, the son of John Babol, the opponent of Bruce, to invade that country. Baliol had recently been invited by Edward to attend the Engbsh court ; and, in concert with Beaumont and AVake, and other disinherited barons, he cobected a body of troops with the avowed design of subverting the Scottish government. 4. The conduct of the English monarch at this juncture was ex t tremely dishonourable. While pretending great anxiety i A' D' to observe the treaty between the kingdoms, he not only j 1332. conniveci at the attempt of Babol, but secretly encouraged it. At this critical juncture the regent died suddenly, as there is too much reason to bebeve, by poison, administered to him by an"], [76, "[A. D. 1332. 58 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. agent of the invading faction. The death of this great man, under circumstances of such peril, must be regarded as a national calamity. After much contention among the Scottish barons, Donald Earl of Mar, nephew to the late king, was appointed to the regency. The choice was eveiy way unfortunate, for Mar was totally unfit for such an office. The election had scarcely been made, when word was brought that Baliol and his adherents had entered the Frith of Forth. They disembarked soon after at Kinghorn ; and, marching across the country, encamped near Forteviot, having then front de fended by the river Earn. The regent drew up his army, which was more than ten times as numerous as that of Babol, upon Duppbn Moor, on the opposite bank of the river, while the Earl of March, with an army nearly as powerful, was only eight mbes distant on the enemy's left flank. But Babol had secret friends in the Scottish armies ; and then disgraceful treachery, combined with the incapa city of the regent, rescued him from his perilous situation. Andrew Minray of Tulbbardine, a Scottish baron, in the army of March, basely pointed out to the Engbsh a ford in the Earn, by which it could be crossed in safety ; and, setting out at midnight, they passed the river, and surprised the camp of the Scots, who were completely taken at unawares. The rout soon became total. The whole of the Scottish army was slain, put to flight, or taken captive ; and the regent himself, many others of the nobibty and knights, and not fewer than thirteen thousand men, were left dead on the field. It is satisfactory to know that Murray did not escape the punishment which his base treachery merited. He was made prisoner at Perth about two months after, tried, found gubty, and executed. 5. After the battle of Duppbn, the victorious army took posses sion of Perth, which they were hastny fortifying with pabsades, when the second army of the Scots, led by the Earl of March, was seen approaching the place. But this noble, who was in reality attached to the English interest, made no attempt to assault the town, or to dislodge the invaders ; and, in a short time, he led back and dispersed his army. 6. No farther opposition being for the present made to Babol, he j now repaired to Scone ; and, on the 24th of September ' ' 1332, was crowned king of Scotland. Scarcely had he ob- 33 \u2022 I tained possession of the Scottish crown, when he shewed how unworthy he was to wear it. Edward had now thrown aside his flimsy and hypocritical pretences, and was advancing with an army to the borders, when Babol hastened to meet him at Rox burgh, surrendered to him the bberties of the country, and acknow ledged the English monarch as his feudal lord. But he was not long permitted to occupy a throne which his pusillanimity and base sel-"], [77, "A. D. 1332.] 59 DAVID II. fishness disgraced. While he lay encamped in careless security at Annan, a body of horse, under the command of young Randolph, Sir Simon Fraser, and Archibald Douglas, broke in upon him at midnight, slew his brother and many of bis fobowers, and chased Babol himself, abnost naked, across the borders. 7. Meanwhile, the veteran Sir Andrew Moray of Bothweb, the early companion of Wabace, and the friend and brother-in-law of Robert Brace, was appointed regent. His first step was to provide for the safety of the young king and queen, by sending them to France, where they were kindly and honourably received by the French king. But the misfortunes of the Scots were not yet at an end. Sir Wilhain Douglas, the knight of Liddesdale, son of the good Lord James, in a conflict with a body of English, was defeated and taken prisoner ; and shortly after the regent himself fell into the hands of the enemy, and was thrown into prison, where he re mained for two years. Thus were the Scots deprived, in their hour of utmost need, of two of thefr most skflful leaders. The regency was consented upon Archibald Douglas, who, though a brave solr dier, but poorly suppbed the place of the cabn and sagacious Moray. 8. Hostibties having now commenced between the two nations, Edward assembled a powerful army, and sat down before Berwick. The Earl of March was governor of the castle, and Sfr Alexander Seton of the town. The garrison, though neither numerous nor web suppbed, made a strenuous defence, and Edward was, in the end, obbged to convert the siege into a blockade. Thefr supplies having fabed, the defenders were at length reduced to such distress, that they agreed to surrender, if not relieved by a certain day ; and for the performance of these conditions, several hostages, among whom was a son of the governor Seton, were debvered to the Eng bsh king. Before the appointed period had expned, the regent ap proached at the head of a numerous army, and succeeded in throw ing some troops into the town, when Sir Wilham Keith, one of their leaders, was chosen governor. With the view of inducing the enemy to raise the siege, Douglas entered Northumberland, and laid waste the country. But the attempt fabed, and Edward, on the depar ture of the Scottish army, summoned the ganison to surrender, as the time agreed on for their being succoured had expired. But they refused to comply with this demand, abeging that they had received succours both of provisions and of men. On receiving this refusal, Edward declared his resolution to put the son of the late governor to death ; and, as this threat produced no effect on the mind of Seton, who had determined to hold out the town to the last extre mity, the noble youth was, with savage cruelty, executed within sight of the wabs. The citizens of Berwick now became alarmed"], [78, "[A.

On receiving intelligence of this agreement, the regent returned towards Berwick, and resolved to hazard an engagement. 9. The English army was most advantageously posted on an eminence cabed Habdon Hib, which was separated by a morass I . -p from the opposite hib, on which the Scottish forces were I '\u201e\u201e\" drawn up, July 20, 1333. The Scots, with their charac- I 1 teristic impetuosity, began the battle. As they eagerly advanced through the marshy ground which separated them from the enemy, they were exposed to the discharge of the Engbsh arch ers, who slew great numbers of them before they were able to come hand to hand with then- foes. At length they succeeded in extri cating themselves from the morass, and, rushing up the hib, attacked the English with great fury. But the latter, being quite fresh, and advantageously posted, succeeded, after a short but fierce conflict, in repelbng thefr adversaries, rendered breathless and disordered by cbmbing the bib, and dispbited by the numbers slain in crossing the marsh. The whole Scottish army was driven off the field with great slaughter. The regent himself was mortaby woimded, and taken prisoner. The Earls of Lennox, Ross, Carrick, Sutherland, Strath era, and Athole, together with many other Scottish nobles and ba rons, and fourteen thousand men, were left dead upon the field. Berwick immediately siurendered to the victors, and the Earl of March, governor of the castle, gave in his adherence to the Engbsh interest. 10. The loss which the Scots had suffered in the battle of Habdon Hib seemed frretrievable, and Babol once more became master of almost the whole kingdom. The fortresses of Dumbarton, Ur quhart, Loch Leven, Kildrummie, Lochmaben, and Locbdon, were ab that now remamed in possession of the adherents of king David. A mock parliament was held by Babol at Edinburgh, on the 10th of February 1334, for the purpose of rewarding his adherents, and gratifying the monarch who had seated him on a dishonoured throne. The Engbsh nobles who had assisted in the enterprise were recom pensed for then exertions by grants of the estates forfeited by the adherents of David Bruce. To the Engbsh king were ceded in per petuity the whole of the frontier provinces of Berwickshfre, Selkirk shire, Peeblesshfre, and Dumfriesshfre, together with the Lothians ;"], [79, "A. D. 1335.] DAVID II. 61 and Babol soon after consummated the infamy of this transaction, by paying homage to Edward for the mutilated and dismembered remnant of the kingdom. Such conduct deeply incensed the nation against him, and even estranged some of his own partisans. An important counter-revolution speedily took place. Fierce dissen sions broke out among Babol's supporters. The adherents of the royal family became emboldened by this disunion among their ene mies ; and, suddenly reappearing from the mountains and fastnesses in which they had found refuge, they attacked the supporters of Babol, and obtained various bnportant advantages over them. Three of the most powerful of the \" disinherited\" barons, Talbot, Beanmont, and Athole, were successively defeated and made pri soners. The vassal king himself was chased once more across the Borders ; and Randolph Earl of Moray, son of the great regent, and the young Steward of Scotland, were chosen joint-regents of the kingdom. 11. Edward, on learning the disasters which his vassal had met with, immediately levied an army, and advanced into Scotland, al though it was now the middle of November ; but ab his efforts to produce a permanent impression upon the countiy were unavailing. A similar expedition, undertaken next summer (July 1335), was equaby unsuccessful. On both occasions, the Scots were careful to avoid an open engagement, and contented themselves with remov ing their cattle and goods into the fastnesses of the mountains ; and, lurking in ambush among the glens and woods, they suddenly as saulted and cut off ab who straggled from the main body of the army. In this way they succeeded in destroying great numbers of their enemies, and ultimately compebed them to retreat from the country. 12. A short time before this second expedition was undertaken, the Scottish barons held a parbament at Dairsie in Fife, for the pur pose of forming a systematic plan of operations for the bberation of the country. But the pride and ambition of the Earl of Athole, who had now joined the adherents of Bruce, excited such dissen sions among the nobles, that their debberations came to no useful result. Shortly after this, the regent Moray was taken prisoner and shut up in Bamborough Castle ; and Athole, who seems to have aspired to the vacant office, once more made his peace with Edward, and was immediately appointed governor of Scotland under Baliol. Eager to distinguish himself in the service of his new master, and to gratify his own rapacity and revenge, this powerful but versatbe nobleman began to exercise great cruelties on the friends of Brace, and laid siege to Kildrammie Castle, in which Christian, the sister of Robert Bruce and wife of Sir Andrew Moray, had taken refuge."], [80, "62 [A. D. 1338. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Moray immediately collected an army, and, accompanied by the Knight of Liddesdale and the Earl of March, who had again aban doned the cause of Baliol, hastened to raise the siege. They came suddenly upon Athole, lying in the forest of Kbblane ; and, after a short resistance, his troops gave way on ab sides. Athole himself was among the slain ; and his death at this period was considered as a most favourable event for the pubbc cause. Sir Andrew Moray was shortly after appointed to the office of regent. 13. Soon after the death of Athole, the English monarch again invaded Scotland with a powerful army, and penetrated as far as Inverness, laying waste the country with fire and sword ; but the cautious pobcy of the regent completely baffled the designs of the invaders, and they were soon compelled to retreat by the conse quences of the very desolation which they themselves had made. No sooner had the enemy withdrawn, than the Scots came forth from their fastnesses, assaulted and stormed the fortresses which Edward had repaired and ganisoned ; after which, according to the pobcy of Robert Bruce, they were broken up and dismantled. 14. While affairs were in this state in Scotland, war broke out A yy between France and England. Edward made pubbc claim iqq7 to the throne of that kingdom, and proceeded to enforce 1 his pretensions by an appeal to arms. While engaged in fobowing out this new plan of ambition, he entrusted the command of the army in Scotland to the Earls of Arandel, Salisbury, and Norfolk. In order to gain time, he had previously attempted to amuse the Scots with the hopes of a general peace ; but his over tures were rejected by the regent and his associates, who determined to avail themselves of so favourable an opportunity for the entire expulsion of the enenry, and therefore pushed the war with vigour. On the 28th of January 1338, Sabsbiuy laid siege to the important castle of Dunbar, which, in the absence of the Earl of March, to whom the fortress belonged, was defended by his wife, Agnes, daughter of the famous Randolph Earl of Moray. For five months this heroic lady bravely held out the castle, and successfuby resisted every assault. At length the Engbsh, fobed in their open attacks, resolved to convert the siege into a blockade. But, in the end, the ganison, after enduring great privations, were rebeved by the gal lant Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie, who contrived to pass un observed in the dead of night through the bne of the enemy's fleet, and to ran a light vessel, laden with provisions, close under the wab of the castle. On learning this exploit, the besiegers were so much disheartened that they raised the siege. 15. About this time, Scotland sustained a heavy loss in the death of Sir Andrew Moray, the regent, who expired at his castle of"], [81, "A. D. 1341.] 63 DAVID II. Avoch, in Ross. He was succeeded in his office by the Steward of Scotland, who soon showed himself worthy of the important trust. His first act was to send the Knight of Liddesdale to sobcit assist ance from the French court. He then commenced the siege of Perth, and, with the assistance of five ships of war, and some men-at-arms sent from France, compebed the ganison, after an obstinate defence, to capitulate. He next proceeded to besiege Stnling, which also yielded to his arms. The castle of Edinburgh was soon after wrested from the enemy, by means of a stratagem devised by a bold and able ecclesiastic, named Bubock, who had at one time been chancebor to Babol, but now brought bis powerful talents and uncommon genius for war to aid the popular cause. Others of the Scottish leaders, especiaby the Knight of Liddesdale, and Sir Alexander Ramsay, exerted themselves with great success to expel the English from the country ; and the government of the rightful monarch was at length so completely restored, that it was thought advisable that king David, who had for nine years been an exile in a foreign land, should return to his own dominions. The youthful king accordingly embarked with his consort, and landed in safety at Inverbervie on the 4th of June 1341, where he was received with enthusiastic joy by ab classes of the people. 16. David was now in his eighteenth year, and began to exhibit a character very unlike that of his heroic father. He was head strong, violent in his passions, and immoderately fond of pleasure ; and, though possessed of considerable personal courage, quite un fitted for the government of a country like Scotland, and ignorant of the character of the turbulent barons over whom he was cabed to rule. Shortly after his arrival in his dominions, the gabant Sir Alexander Ramsay captured the important fortress of Roxburgh in a night attack, and the king, as a reward for his valour, bestowed upon hbn the government of the fortress, and the sheriffdom of the county. The Knight of Liddesdale, who then held the office of sheriff, was deeply offended by this imprudent act, and, leading a band of soldiers to Hawick, where the new sheriff was holding his court, he seized him while on the bench of justice, carried him off to his castle of Hermitage, where he cast him into a dungeon, and left him to perish of hunger. Such was the weakness of David's government, that he was obbged, not only to pardon the murderer, but to bestow upon hbn the office which had led to the perpetration of the inhuman deed. 17. The war with England stib continued to rage ; and to such a miserable condition was the countiy reduced in consequence of the ravages committed by both parties, that the land was left unculti vated, and a terrible famine broke out, and continued for several"], [82, "[A. D. 1346. 64 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. years. The wbd deer came down from the mountains, and ranged undisturbed in the immediate vicinity of the towns. Multitudes fled from the countiy in despair. Some, in the extremities of star vation, devoured substances most abhon-ent to human nature ; and it is even said that some miserable wretches were driven by want and miseiy to prey on human flesh. Famine was fobowed by its natural consequence \u2014 disease ; a pestbence swept the land, and de stroyed many thousands of the enfeebled inhabitants. 18. The Engbsh monarch was stib absent in France, and various attacks were made upon the borders, but without leading to any decisive success on either side. A two years' truce was, however, concluded, which was to end at Martinmas 1346. It was broken by a furious incursion of the Knight of Liddesdale into England ; and hostilities commenced with greater violence than before. David cobected a formidable army at Perth, and invaded England by the western frontier, plundering and laying waste the whole countiy. Marching through the bishopric of Durham, and carrying every where devastation and ruin, he encamped at a place cabed Beau repair, within a short distance of the city of Durham. Here, on the 17th of October 1346, he was unexpectedly attacked by a powerful army, under the command of Percy, Nevibe, and other great northern barons, together with the archbishops of Canterbury and York, and the bishops of Durham, Carbsle, and Lincoln. The Scots, after an obstinate resistance, were entfrely routed. David himself, and the Knight of Liddesdale, the earls of Fife, Menteith, Sutherland, and Wigton, and fifty other barons and knights, were taken prisoners ; and De la Haye the Constable, Keith the Marshal, Chartres the High Chancellor, and Peebles the Lord Chamberlain, with the earls of Moray and Strathern, and thfrty barons and fifteen thousand men, were slain. 19. This calamitous defeat, usuaby termed the battle of Nevibe's Cross, brought the most terrible miseries on Scotland. The whole countiy south of the Forth was at once abandoned to the enemy. Edward, looking upon Scotland as at length completely subdued, laid aside the pretence of confening the crown upon Babol, and ap pointed certain barons to receive the homage which it was supposed the Scots were now wibing to pay to the Engbsh monarch himself. But these expectations were speedily found to be premature. Though cast down, the Scottish people were not in despafr. The High Steward, the heir to the throne, who, along with the Earl of March, had made good his retreat from the fatal field of Nevibe's Cross, was appointed guardian of the kingdom, and exerted himself with great zeal and success in defence of the bberties of his country. His efforts were powerfully seconded by William Lord Douglas, nephew"], [83, "A. D. 1354.] DAVID II. 65 of the good Sir James, who, at this critical period, returned from France, where he had been bred to arms ; and, with the hereditary valour of his house, succeeded in expelling the English from Dou glasdale, and, in process of time, from Ettrick Forest and Teviotdale. 20. Notwithstanding these successes, the English monarch could not prevail upon his barons to aid him in a renewal of hostilities ; and he was reluctantly compelled to consent to a trace with the Steward, which was renewed from time to time for six years. The object of Edward seems to have been to fill his coffers with a large ransom for his royal prisoner, and to obtain possession of the Scot tish throne by secret intrigues and negotiations, since he had failed in open war. With this view, David was treated with kindness, and was even permitted to revisit his dominions upon his parole, and on giving hostages for his return. There is too much reason to believe that the king's impatience for his restoration to freedom made him willing to surrender the rights and liberties of his country, and he appears even to have taken some steps for that purpose. But the people declared with one voice, that they would never agree, for any consideration, to barter the independence of then- country. Da vid was therefore reluctantly compelled to return to his captivity. 21. While these negotiations were carrying on between the two kings, the Knight of Liddesdale, who had also been taken prisoner at the battle of Neville's Cross, was induced to purchase his liberty at the expense of his honour, and to tarnish the fair fame of his for mer achievements, by transferring to the English monarch that al legiance and duty which he owed to his own king and country. But his treachery was speedily discovered, and his intrigues entirely de feated by Lord William Douglas, whom he had expected to gain over to his dark designs. Shortly after his return from England, he was waylaid, and slain by his kinsman, while hunting in Ettrick Forest. 22. At this period a dreadful pestilence, which had for several years swept through Europe, at last reached Scotland, and carried off immense numbers of the people. It is calculated that not fewer than one-third of the inhabitants fell victims to its ravages, aggra vated, as they must have been, by the desolating war which had so long raged in the country. 23. Meanwhile, David had made various unsuccessful attempts to obtain his liberty, and negotiations for this object were repeatedly begun and broken off. At length a treaty was agreed upon at New castle (July 1354), in which the king's ransom was fixed at the enormous sum of ninety thousand merks. But before the treaty was ratified, an ambassador arrived from France, bringing with him a seasonable supply of money, which he distributed among the Scot- c 2"], [84, "[A. D. 1356. 66 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. tish nobles. By his persuasion the treaty was broken off, and an invasion of England resolved on as soon as the truce expired. The Northumbrian borderers, however, were the first aggressors. Reprisals were soon successfully made by the Scots. The governor of Norham castle fell into an ambuscade laid for him by Sir William Ramsay, and was defeated and made prisoner. The Earls of Angus and March made themselves masters of the important town of Ber wick, but failed to obtain possession of the castle. No sooner did the tidings of these successes reach Edward, who was then at Calais, than he hastened home with those veteran troops that had gained so much fame in the French wars, and sat down before Berwick with an army of eighty thousand men. The castle was still in pos session of the English, and the Scottish garrison were totally unpre pared for defence. They capitulated, therefore, on honourable terms, and were permitted to evacuate the town, and return to Scotland. 24. Berwick being regained, Edward prepared, for the fifth time, to march into Scotland, determined now to make a final conquest of the country. With a view to the promotion of this object, Baliol ap peared before the English monarch at Roxburgh, formally divested himself of the emblems of royalty in which he was clothed, and so lemnly surrendered into his hands all claims on the sovereignty of Scotland. The ceremony was evidently arranged for the purpose of giving a colour of justice to the war which Edward was about to undertake, and to facilitate his designs upon the Scottish crown. Baliol was rewarded for his subserviency with an annual pension of two thousand pounds. After this he sunk into obscurity, and died childless in the year 1363. 25. The Scottish leaders prepared to meet the impending inva- \u00ab t> si\u00b0n according to the lessons of defensive war taught them i *?'*;\u00ab ' ky their great deliverer Bruce. On entering Scotland, the L English found the country deserted by its inhabitants, who had removed all their cattle and provisions into the fastnesses of the forests and mountains. Enraged at the difficulties with which he was surrounded, the English king, with a cruel and short-sighted policy, burned every town and village which he approached, and utterly destroyed even the churches and religious houses. But these ravages only aggravated the difficulties of his position. He could procure neither provisions for his men nor forage for their horses. The victualling ships which he had despatched from Ber wick were dispersed by a storm, and completely destroyed. Fa mine stared him in the face ; and, after penetrating as far as Edin burgh, he found it absolutely necessary to retreat, in order to save his army from total rain. His return was not effected without con-"], [85, "A. D. 1357.] DAVID II. 67 siderable loss. Every glen, morass, and forest swarmed with ene mies ready to pounce upon the retreating and disorderly invaders, whenever an opportunity offered ; and the king himself, on one oc casion, very narrowly escaped being made prisoner. 26. The failure of this formidable enterprise seems to have con vinced Edward of the necessity of resorting to other means than those of open war for the purpose of establishing his supremacy in Scotland. Negotiations for the ransom and liberation of the Scot tish king were therefore renewed, and were at length brought to a successful termination (1357). The ransom finally agreed on was a hundred thousand pounds. The payment of this large sum con tinned for many years to be a heavy burden on the impoverished countiy, and was not finally discharged till the seventh year of Richard H. 27. David, thus restored to freedom after a captivity of eleven years, was enthusiastically welcomed by the people on lus return to his own dominions. But his conduct soon alienated from him the affections of the nation. His feelings and attachments were strongly in favour of the English monarch, who had obtained a complete ascendency over him ; and he entered with avidity into a disgrace ful plot to set aside the right of the Steward to the throne of Scot land, in favour of Lionel Duke of Clarence the third son of the English king. Meanwhile, Edward sought by every method in his power to ingratiate himself with the people of Scotland. Many of the Scottish nobles and prelates visited the English court, where they were treated with marked favour. A lucrative trade commenced between the countries, and the merchants of Scotland were conciliated by grants of protection and immunity. The Scot tish youth of quality were encouraged to repair to the English Uni versities ; and, by these artful plans, Edward seems to have hoped that he would at last be able to bring his designs upon the freedom of Scotland to a successful issue. The negotiations between the two monarch3 were carried on in secret for several years, till at length David ventured to lay the plan that had been so long maturing, be fore the parliament which met at Scone in March 1363. The pro posal was received with a burst of indignation. Instantly and unanimously the members replied, \" We never will allow an Eng lishman to rule over us.\" The king was deeply em-aged at this re solute answer ; but he repressed his feelings, and made no reply. David apparently passed from his design of altering the succession to the crown ; but the proposal alarmed the Steward and his friends, and, according to a common practice in that age, they entered into a bond or agreement of mutual defence, and assembled then retainers to compel the king by force to adhere to the order of sue-"], [86, "[A. D. 1369. 68 niSTORY OF SCOTLAND. cession, as fixed in the days of Robert Brace. David, however, was not deficient in personal courage, and manifested on this oc casion a very unexpected degree of promptitude and decision. He immediately issued a proclamation commanding the rebels to lay down their arms and return to their allegiance ; and he levied a numerous army for the purpose of compelling obedience to his com mands. Fortunately both parties were afraid of proceeding to ex tremities, and the calamities of a civil war were averted. The Stew ard and his associates laid down their arms, and consented to re nounce their engagements in a parliament assembled at Inchmur dach, May 14, 1363 ; and, in recompense for this prompt return to his duty, the Steward's title to the succession was fully recognised, and the earldom of Carrick, once a title of Robert Bruce, was con ferred on his eldest son, afterwards Robert HI. 28. Some time before this, Joanna, Queen of Scotland, had died at Hertford Castle, in England ; and, at this critical period, the im prudent monarch added to the difficulties by which he was sur rounded by a marriage with Margaret Logie, a young woman of re markable beauty, but inferior birth. This unwise step disgusted the haughty nobles, and seems to have caused an open rupture be tween the king and his kinsman, the Steward ; and such was the influence which the young queen possessed over her reckless and selfish husband, that he cast the Steward and his son the Lord of Badenoch, into prison, where they were long detained. In the course of a very few years, however, discord broke out in the royal family. From causes which are involved in obscurity, David seems to have become estranged from the queen ; and, anxious to dissolve the unequal alliance which he had so rashly formed, he procured a sentence of divorce to be pronounced by the Scottish bishops. But the queen appealed to the Pope against this decision, and went to Avignon to prosecute her appeal in person. Her cause met with a favourable hearing at the papal court ; but she did not live to bring it to a conclusion, as she died on her journey to Rome, 18th Febru ary 1369. Immediately after the divorce, the Steward and his sons were released from prison, and restored to the royal favour. 29. Although the proposal made by David to settle the crown on one of the sons of the English king was promptly and indignantly rejected by the Scottish people, the degenerate monarch did not abandon his base design. He undertook several journeys to Eng land ; and there is the clearest evidence that, during his residence in that country, he took an active part in the intrigues which the English monarch was constantly carrying on for the purpose of se curing this grand object of his ambition. Many of the nobility were, as usual, gained over to the English interest ; and Edward seems"], [87, "A. D. 1370.] STATE OF THE COUNTRY. 69 to have skilfully availed himself of the difficulties under which the Scottish nation laboured in raising the enormous sum which they had stipulated to pay for the king's ransom. But the great mass of the people were determined to preserve the independence of their countiy at all hazards, and the appeals made to then- hopes and fears proved alike unsuccessful. In the midst of these nefarious schemes, David was seized with a mortal illness, and died in the castle of Edinburgh on the 22d of February 1370, in the forty seventh year of his age, and the forty-first of his reign. It is a me lancholy consideration, that the death of the only son of Robert Bruce must have been regarded by his subjects as a national deli verance. CHAPTER VHI. State of the Country. 1. At the period of which we have been writing, the aspect of Scotland was very different from that which it now presents. The face of the country was covered by immense forests, through which roamed not only the deer, but the bear, the wolf, the wild boar, and the bison. Extensive morasses occupied many of the level districts, and afforded, in their inaccessible recesses, a secure refuge to the inhabitants from the invasion of their enemies. The whole land was studded with immense fortresses, erected for the purpose of maintaining the royal authority, or with the equally strong baronial castles, which formed the residences of the great feudal nobility of the kingdom. These vast strongholds, the remains of which are still to be seen in the present day, scattered over every district in Scotland, must have formed one of the most striking features in the appearance of the country at this period. Around these fortresses were placed the habitations of the vassals and retainers of the great feudal lords, and of the artisans who ministered to their necessities and comforts ; and as much ground in the vicinity was cleared from wood as was necessary for their support. To many of the small villages upon the large feudal estates was attached a district of land, which was cultivated partly by free tenants, and partly by the villagers and cottars, who were in many instances the property of the lord of the soil. 2. The constitution and government of the country, which were originally Celtic, became in the course of time decidedly feudal, and exhibited all the marks by which the feudal system has been cha-"], [88, "history of Scotland. [A. D. 1249-1370. 70 vacterised. Ample provision was made for the due maintenance of the royal dignity ; and, making allowance for the circumstances of the country, the personal state supported by the Scottish king was scarcely inferior to that kept up by the English sovereign. Like other feudal monarchs, the king was surrounded by his justiciar, chancellor, constable, marshal, and other great officers of state, who svere selected from the most powerful nobles, and, next to the sove reign, held the highest rank in the nation. The power of the great barons was hardly inferior to that of the monarch himself. Their vast estates and numerous vassals enabled them almost singly to compete with him, and a combination among these powerful and turbulent nobles proved in not a few cases more than a match for the royal authority. They were, indeed, in almost every respect, kings in miniature. Each of these barons was encircled by his own officers, and was on all occasions supported by a train of knights, squires, and inferior barons, who were ready to pay implicit obedi ence to his commands, even in opposition to those of the sovereign himself. Every baron, too, was the supreme criminal judge within his own estates, possessed the power of Use and death over his own vassals, and could even reclaim from the royal court any dependent or retainer who lived upon his lands. Such a state of society, it is evident, must have been attended by many evils ; and it is to the exorbitant power of these nobles, and to their selfish struggles for superiority, that the miseries which Scotland for many ages endured are directly to be traced. 3. At this period the clergy formed a numerous and most influ ential portion of the community. Their cathedrals, monasteries, and other ecclesiastical buildings, constructed in the most magnifi cent style of architecture, constituted an imposing feature in the ex ternal aspect of the country. 4. Besides the cathedral establishments, Scotland appears to have possessed numerous religious houses, connected with almost all the various orders of regular and secular churchmen which then existed in Europe ; and, both in the splendour of their architecture, and in the munificence of their endowments, the Scottish ecclesiastical in stitutions appear to have been little inferior to those of England, or of the continent. During this period almost all the learning that existed was possessed by the clergy. The study of the Scriptures was interdicted to the laity, and the great mass of the people were almost entirely destitute of religious knowledge. \" It was a land of darkness, as darkness itself, and the light was as darkness.\" In a civil point of view, however, it must be admitted that the influ ence exerted by the church was highly beneficial, and that the clergy were, for the most part, the strenuous defenders of the liber-"], [89, "A. D. 1249-1370.] state of the country. 71 ties of the nation. At an early period they were called to assert the independence of the Scottish church against the claims of spiri tual supremacy put forth by the metropolitan sees of York and Can terbury. In this contest they were supported by the whole power of the crown, and their opposition to the unfounded pretensions of the English sees proved completely successful. Pope Clement ID in the reign of William the Lion, adopted the Scottish church, \" as the special and favourite daughter of the apostolic see ; declared it to be subject to no intermediate power whatever ;\" and thus at once put an end to the pretended superiority of the English church. Other privileges of great importance were conceded by the succes sors of this pontiff. In 1225 Honorius was induced, by the repre sentations of the Scottish clergy, to give them permission to as semble a General Council on their own authority. This permission was undoubtedly meant to be only temporary, but it was ambign ously expressed ; and, availing themselves of this, the clergy in terpreted and treated it as of perpetual authority, and continued to assemble frequent provincial councils under its sanction. From this period the visits of the papal legates were steadily declined, their authority disclaimed, and then; pecuniary exactions success fully resisted. 5. While the clergy were thus engaged in asserting their own in dependence, their influence was beneficially exerted, both in refin ing the manners of the people, and in opposing the lawless schemes of the nobility. The Church was the faithful auxiliary of the crown in the incessant struggles which the monarch was compelled to carry on against the ambitious schemes of the great feudal barons. In Scotland, as in other countries of Europe at this period, it was among the clergy alone that we find anything like proficiency in the arts and in literature ; and, in the ordinary studies of the age, the Scottish ecclesiastics were not far behind their brethren on the con tinent. Several of them, indeed, obtained a very high reputation in scholastic theology ; and mathematics, astronomy, and the sister art of astrology, seem to have been cultivated among them with some success. Schools were at this period to be found in the prin cipal towns of Scotland, and probably also in many of the monas teries and convents ; but these were almost universally abandoned to the clergy. The great mass of the community were immersed in gross ignorance. The nobility seem to have considered the acquire ment of learning as altogether unworthy of their rank ; and there is good reason to believe that not a single Scottish baron of this age could sign his own name. In these circumstances, we owe it to the clergy alone that science and learning did not become altogether extinct. It is to the monastic annalists that we are indebted for"], [90, "72 [A. D. 1249-1370. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the most striking pictures of the manners of these times ; and it should not be forgotten that Barbour, the metrical historian of Bruce, and the only writer of original genius which Scotland pro duced in that age, was an eminent ecclesiastic. The clergy not merely held a monopoly of the learning of those remote times, but were almost the sole proficients both in the useful and in the orna mental arts. They were the painters, the sculptors, the mechanics, as well as the historians and poets of the age ; and it is to them that we are especially indebted for those magnificent baronial and eccle siastical buildings, the mouldering remains of which still attest the munificence and the taste of our ancestors. 6. With regard to the other classes of the community, the free farmers or tenants, who rented the lands of the crown and of the other great proprietors, seem to have been possessed of considerable wealth. It has been supposed that it was this class who were liable to be called out on military service, and who constituted the great body of the Scottish infantry. A second class of cultivators of the soil were the bondsmen or villeyns, who were the absolute property of the lord of the soil, and were sold along with the land. This state of slavery was abolished only by slow degrees. Traces of its existence are to be found as late as the fifteenth century ; and it existed in a modified form among the colliers, in various parts of the countiy, down to a comparatively recent period. 7. As the domains of the church were, for the most part, in the richest and most fertile parts of the country, the clergy soon became distinguished for then attention to agricultural improvements. The wise practice of granting leases appears to have been introduced by them. Their lands were, therefore, better cultivated than the lands of the nobility. Their tenants were more prosperous ; and, from the pacific character of then- landlords, were permitted to devote their attention more exclusively to their own peculiar pursuits than the tenants either of the crown or of the barons. 8. Oats, which formed the bread of the lower classes, and the malt from which their ale was brewed, seem to have been tne prin cipal kind of grain raised in Scotland at that early period. Wheat and barley were also grown to a considerable extent, as were also pease and beans. Immense herds of horses constituted an impor tant part of the agricultural wealth of the great proprietors. The pasture-lands were stocked with extensive flocks of sheep and herds of cattle. Wool formed the chief article of export. Large herds of swine fed on the beech-mast, and formed the staple animal food of the lower classes. Cheese appears to have been manufactured in considerable quantities ; and the rearing of poultry was carefully at tended to in the farm establishments. The fisheries were numerous"], [91, "A. D. 1249-1370.] state of the country. 73 and productive, and the lakes and rivers of the country furnished for all classes an inexhaustible supply of food. It is evident, from these facts, that in Scotland, at this period, there was no want of the necessaries and even comforts of life. In the opinion of a highly competent judge, even the lower orders were, so far as respects the means of subsistence, in a prosperous condition ; and, from a com parison of the wages of labour with the price of provisions, it is ob vious that the labouring classes of the community must have lived in comparative comfort. 9. At a very early period, the Scottish merchants established a commercial intercourse with the continent, which, especially during the prosperous reign of David I., was the means of greatly aug menting the wealth of the nation. The prosperity of the country was also very much promoted by the arrival of multitudes of wealthy and enterprising Flemings, who formed settlements in almost every part of Scotland, and were important instruments in softening the character of the people, and teaching them habits of application and industry. The gradual rise of the towns and royal burghs, as a matter of course, proved highly conducive to the advancement of the mercantile wealth and general prosperity of the kingdom. The small clusters of hamlets which, for the sake of security, were placed in the vicinity of the royal and baronial castles, and formed the dwellings of the feudal vassals and retainers, grew, by degrees, into extensive settlements of skilful and enterprising artisans, who again, in the course of time, were transformed into wealthy manufacturers and traders. These communities became the nurseries of freedom, and afforded a safe asylum to the slave who could escape from the vigilance of his master. Their power and privileges continued steadily to increase, till at length they were formed into chartered corporations, endowed with peculiar immimities and rights, \u2014 thus forming, by their enterprise and wealth, a useful check on the over weening arrogance and exorbitant power of the barons. 10. The exports of the country at this period were principally composed of wool, skins, hides, fish, horses, sheep, and cattle, and occasionally of pearis, falcons, and greyhounds. The imports con sisted of fine linen and silks, broad cloth, and a rich woollen cloth called sayes, carpets and tapestry, wine, oil of olives, spices, arms, armour, and cutlery. The inhabitants of Scotland must, at a very early period, have directed their attention to the arts of ship-build ing and navigation ; but it was not till the reign of David H., that attempts were made to maintain a regular naval force. The Scot tish ships of war, during the long-continued hostilities with England, plundered the merchant vessels of their enemies, and made repeat ed and destructive descents upon their coast. The commerce ot u"], [92, "74 history of Scotland. [A. D. 1249-1370. the English suffered severely from these naval attacks ; and the Scottish navy at this period appears to have possessed a decided superiority over that of England. 11. With regard to the architecture of these primitive times, though strength and security were the qualities chiefly aimed at in the erection of the baronial castles of the nobility, yet elegance was by no means overlooked ; and great ingenuity and skill were fre quently displayed in combining security with comfort and splendour. The houses of the merchants and artisans, as well as of the farmers and bondsmen, were invariably built of wood ; though there is no reason to believe that they were destitute of either the conveniences or even the elegances of life. But the architectural skill of the age was chiefly manifested in the erection of the monasteries, cathe drals, and other ecclesiastical buildings, which reared then- towers in every district of the country. These magnificent structures were, for the most part, the work of ecclesiastics ; and both the grandeur of then- plan, and the extraordinary skill and genius shewn in thefr execution, manifest the great proficiency which their archi tects must have made in mathematical and mechanical philosophy. The existing remains of these beautiful and imposing edifices are of themselves a sufficient proof of the perfection to which this noble style of architecture was carried in Scotland by the monks, and of the munificence with which they were patronized by the monarchs and nobility of that early age. 12. The high excellence to which the architecture of that period had attained, necessarily implies a corresponding degree of excel lence in many other useful and ornamental arts, requisite for fitting up and adorning the mansions of the nobility and clergy. The ma nufacture of steel and iron implements must have been successfully practised by a people so frequently engaged in war, and who em ployed the annour and accoutrements of that age. The sumptuous robes worn by the dames and knights, shew that the mysteries of embroidery and needle work, and the art of working in the precious metals, must have attained to considerable perfection. The arms and military costume used by Scottish warriors appears to have been the same as that worn by the Saxons and Normans. The civil dress was rich and graceful, and exactly similar to the dress of the higher ranks in England and France. 13. With regard to the sports and amusements of our ancestors, they appear to have been the same as in the other feudal countries of Europe. The healthy and spirit-stining pastimes of hunting and hawking, seem to have formed the principal recreations of our kings and barons. At a very early period, the Scottish stag-hounds and wolf-dogs were prized in foreign countries, and, during the reign of"], [93, "A.D. 1371.] ROBERT II. 75 David H., Scottish dogs and falcons had become articles of export. Tournaments had become an established amusement in Scotland, at least as early as the reign of Alexander H. Sumptuous feasts and masques, jugglers' tricks, the amusement afforded by the licensed wit of the fool, the game of chess, the reading of romances, and Ms \u25a0 tening to the lays of harpers and minstrels, occupied the time of our ancestors within doors, and when not engaged in the pursuits of war or of the chase.

Davtd H., dying without issue, was succeeded by his nephew and Walter the high steward youth a bold and active sol- Robert, only child of Marjory Brace of Scotland. Robert had been in his dier, and a successful opponent of the designs of the English upon the liberties of the country ; but he was now fifty-five years old, and his natural indolence, together with that love of repose which the approaches of old age tend to produce, made him somewhat un fit to restrain the turbulence and ambition of a fierce and lawless nobility. The Earl of Douglas, one of the most powerful of these nobles, put forth a claim to the crown, as the representative of the families of Comyn and Baliol. But this claim was abandoned as soon as he found that it was not likely to meet with public support ; and as a reward for the promptitude of his obedience, the king's daughter Isabella was promised in marriage to his eldest son. Ro bert n. was therefore crowned at Scone, March 26th 1371, by the"], [94, "[A. D. 1381 . 76 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. bishop of St Andrews. The trace with England still continued, though there was little good-will between the two countries. But Robert was well aware of the benefits of peace, and, both by tem perament aud policy, anxious to avoid the evils of war. The Eng lish, on their side, were not in a condition to renew hostilities. Ed ward HI., whose wicked ambition had proved so destructive of the best and highest interests of both kingdoms, died on the 1st of June 1377, leaving the throne to his grandson Richard H., a boy of ele ven years of age. 2. Various subjects of mutual suspicion and distrust, however, still existed. The power of the barons was too great to be controlled by the crown, and, on the slightest injury offered to one of their vassals, they at once took the law into their own hands. In this way, after mutual injuries and inroads, hostilities again commenced with great fury, and were carried on with systematic rapacity and cruelty. To add to the miseries of this destructive contest, the pes tilence broke out on the frontiers, and, for the space of two years, raged with great violence. 3. In 1381, the celebrated John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the uncle of Richard H., marched to the borders, at the head of a formidable force, and put a temporary close to the miseries of inva sion and plunder, by the establishment of a truce for three years. While the treaty was negotiating, the famous insurrection of Wat Tyler broke out, and Lancaster, who was suspected of having fa voured the insurgents, found it dangerous to return into England. In this perilous dilemma, with a generous confidence highly honour able to his character, he asked permission to make Scotland his temporary place of refuge. His request was promptly acceded to ; and he was treated with the utmost courtesy and attention. The abbey of Holyrood was fitted up for his reception, where he remain ed till the civil commotion was abated, and he could return to Eng land in safety. 4. The French now made overtures to the Scots, for the purpose of instigating them to renew hostilities with England at the end of the trace. The distribution of a large sum of money among the Scottish nobles presented a temptation which was found to be irre sistible ; and on the termination of the trace, the war, in spite of the remonstrances of the old king, was renewed with increased fury. 5. The Duke of Lancaster again entered Scotland at the head of a numerous army, and marched as far as Edinburgh ; but, nundful of the hospitality which he had lately experienced, he generously spared the city, and shortly after retreated, without having accom plished anything of importance. Robert again earnestly advised peace, but all his remonstrances proved unavailing ; and the Earla"], [95, "A. D. 1385.] ROBERT si. 77 of Mar and Douglas, at the head of an army of fifteen thousand men, broke into the northern counties of England, laid waste the whole country with fire and sword, and returned home laden with booty. This destructive inroad led to an instant retaliation on the part of the English ; and both countries continued to suffer all the hard ships of a cruel warfare, undertaken without any definite object, and leading to no conclusive result. 6. In 1385, the French government sent a large body of auxili aries into Scotland, under John de Yienne, Admiral of France. He brought along with him fourteen hundred suits of complete armour for the Scottish knights, and a large sum of money to be paid to the king and barons. The scheme, however, proved eminently unsuc cessful. The French troops, accustomed to a different kind of fare and lodging, murmm-ed at, what they considered, the wretched food and miserable accommodation which they found in Scotland. Their allies, on the other hand, grumbled loudly at the burden of main taining these costly auxiliaries, who, although furnished with the best which then- means afforded, only requited them with murmurs and complaints. 7. In spite of the remonstrances of the king, the Scottish barons assembled an army, and, accompanied by the French admiral and his troops, marched into England, as usual laying waste the coun try and collecting great spoil. The French knights, however, were soon found to be rather an incumbrance than a help in such a mode of warfare. While they were engaged in ravaging the enemy's country, word was brought that a powerful army of the English was advancing to meet them. The French were eager for battle ; but the Scots, with sounder policy, retreated before the enemy, re moving their cattle and provisions, and laying waste the country as they advanced. The invasion of the English proved utterly fruit less, and they were soon compelled to retreat by the impossibility of maintaining themselves in a country where there was nothing to plunder, and little that could even be destroyed. In the mean time, the Scots broke into England by the western marches, and retali ated with tenfold fury the ravages committed by the English. Ac cording to an ancient historian, the Scots obtained more plunder in this inroad, and did more damage to their enemies, than the Eng lish could have inflicted on Scotland, had they burned as far as Aberdeen. 8. The French were now completely disgusted with a mode of warfare in which they reaped neither gold nor glory, and prepared to return to their own country. But the Scots refused to permit their departure until security was given that the French govern-"], [96, "78 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. [A. D. 1388. ment should pay the expenses which they had incurred while in Scotland. 9. In 1388, an invasion of England was detennined on by the Scots, and a large army was assembled at Jedburgh for this pur pose, under the Earl of Fife, second son of the king. But on hear ing that the Northumbrians were preparing to invade Scotland as soon as the Scottish forces should have passed the borders, it was resolved that the main body of the army should march through Liddesdale and assail the western frontiers, while a smaller division, consisting of three hundred men-at-arms, and two thousand foot, under the young Earl of Douglas, should invade England by the eastern marches. 10. By a swift and secret march, Douglas pushed rapidly on through Northumberland, and began to plunder and destroy the rich and populous district of the bishopric of Durham before the English were aware that he had crossed the border. After wasting the country as far as the gates of Durham, he returned to New castle, where lay Sir Henry Percy, renowned by the name of Hot spur, his brother Sir Ralph, and many other Northumbrian barons. A personal encounter took place, at the barriers of the town, be tween Douglas and Percy, in which the pennon of the English leader remained in the possession of the Scottish earl, who boasted that he would cany it to Scotland, and plant it on the highest tower of his castle of Dalkeith. \" That,\" said Percy, \" shalt thou never do.\" \" Well,\" replied Douglas, \" your pennon shall this night be placed before my tent, come and win it if you can.\" 11. The Scots continued their march homeward, and encamped at Otterburn, a hamlet situated in Redesdale, thirty-one miles from Newcastle. Here they resolved to wait for some time, to give Percy an opportunity of fulfilling his promise. As soon as the English leader discovered that Douglas lay encamped at Otterburn, and that he was not supported by the main army of the Scots, he hastily assembled about six hundred lances and eight thousand foot, and marched in pursuit of the enemy. It was evening before Percy came in sight of the Scottish encampment, which he immediately attacked with the greatest fury. The greater part of the troops were asleep ; but Douglas had carefully provided against surprise by a rude but strong barricade of waggons and baggage, which was bravely defended by the servants and camp-followers. This afforded time to the Scottish leader to arm his men, lead them out of the camp, and draw them up in an excellent position. The English, in the mean time, were somewhat disordered by pressing through the Scottish camp, and were surprised to discover by the light of the moon then enemies drawn up in a compact body at a little dis-"], [97, "A. D. 1388.] ROBERT II. 79 tance. The battle instantly joined, and for many hours raged with undiminished fury. Douglas, who was renowned for his personal prowess, wielding a battle-axe with both hands, cut his way into the thickest of the enemy, where, being separated from his followers, he was borne to the earth mortally wounded. But this disaster was unknown to either army, and the Scots, following up the im pulse given by the furious assault of their leader, gained a complete victory. Hotspur and his brother were taken prisoners, and along with them almost all the Englishmen of rank who fought in this celebrated action. This battle, famous in song under the name of Chevy Chase, was fought 15th August 1388. 12. The king being now unequal to the fatigues of state, his second son, the Earl of Fife, was, in 1389, chosen governor of the kingdom. He was appointed to the office in preference to his elder brother, John Earl of Carrick, because the latter, who had been disabled by the kick of a horse, was unable, from bodily weakness, to undertake the management of affaire. In the summer of the same year, a three-years' truce was concluded between France and England ; and Scotland ultimately became a party to this cessation of hostilities. Shortly after this event King Robert died at Dun donald, in Ayrshire, on the 13th of May 1390, in the seventy-fourth year of his age, and the twentieth year of his reign. 13. Robert H. was succeeded by his eldest son, John Earl of Carrick, who was crowned at Scone August 14, 1390. The new king assumed the title of Robert HI., in compliance with the public wish, his own name John being deemed of evil omen, in consequence of its having been borne by John Baliol. The character of Ro bert HI. greatly resembled that of his predecessor. He was ami able, pious, benevolent, and just, but deficient in that personal activity and mental energy which were then indispensably necessary to secure the respect and obedience of a fierce and turbulent nobility. It happened unfortunately, also, for the happiness of the king, and the welfare of the community, that his father, towards the close of his life, had committed the chief power of the state to his brothers, the Earls of Fife and Buchan, the first a man of great ambition, the second a monster of crime, who gave himself up to every species of lust and rapine, and has been traditionally remembered as \" the Wolf of Badenoch.\" At the very commencement of the king's reign, this ferocious savage, in some personal quarrel with the Bishop of Moray, laid waste that province, and plundered and burnt the stately cathedral of Elgin. His natural son, Duncan Stewart, at the head of a tumultuous army of Highlanders, devas tated the county of Angus with reckless cruelty, and in a fierce en counter at Gasklune, near the water of Isla, defeated and slew the"], [98, "80 [A. D. 1400. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Sheriff, with many of the gentry of the county, and about sixty of their followers. It is a striking proof of the weakness of the govern ment, that these acts of rapine and rebellion, committed by a brother and a nephew of the king, were allowed to pass without punishment, or even censure. 14. Meanwhile the country, though torn by intestine feuds, con tinued to enjoy the blessings of external peace. The trace with England was renewed from year to year, and a highly beneficial intercourse sprang up, and was fostered between the two countries. 15. For some time after his accession, Robert seems to have en trusted almost the whole management of public affairs to his brother the Earl of Fife. But his eldest son, David Earl of Carrick, being now twenty years of age, and a youth of considerable ability, though of violent passions, began to dispute the ascendency of his uncle. At a meeting of parliament held at Perth 28th April 1398, the prince was created Duke of Rothesay, and at the same time the dignity of Duke of Albany was bestowed upon the Earl of Fife. It is worthy of notice, that, on this occasion, we find the title of duke for the first time introduced among the Scottish nobility. 16. Rothesay, who was possessed of a handsome person, and ex celled in all knightly accomplishments, was a great favourite with the people, and manifested an increasing impatience of the domina tion of his uncle Albany. Aided by the influence of the queen his mother, and a strong party of friends, he at length compelled his crafty and ambitious relative to resign the office of governor ; and in a parliament held at Perth 27th January 1398, the prince was declared regent of the kingdom for three years. Thus far- the de signs of Rothesay were crowned with success ; but the deep craft of Albany proved in the end more than a match for the youth and pre cipitate ardour of the prince. 17. It was thought proper that the heir apparent to the throne should no longer remain unmarried ; and the powerful Earl of March offered his daughter, with a large dowry, as a suitable match for the prince. His proposals were accepted. But the Earl of Douglas, through the intrigues of Albany, and by the offer of a dowry much more splendid than that promised by March, succeeded in breaking off this negotiation, and in substituting his own daughter in the room of Elizabeth of Dunbar. As might have been expected, this disgraceful transaction excited the deepest indignation in the bosom of March ; and he immediately repaired to the English court, and entered into negotiations with Henry IV., who had recently deposed Richard H., and made himself master of the crown of Eng land. The Douglases added to the injustice and insult with which"], [99, "A. D. 1401.] 81 ROBERT III. March had already been treated, by seizing upon the castle and estates of the absent noble. 18. At this period the truce between England and Scotland ex pired, and mutual inroads were immediately made by the fierce borderers. Henry was well aware that Albany bore him no good will : he therefore received the Earl of March with distinguished favour ; and prepared, at the head of a powerful army, to chastise a y. the depredations of the Scottish borderers. He accordingly ' ' penetrated into Scotland as far as Edinburgh, where he '_} laid siege to the castle, which was gallantly defended by the Duke of Rothesay. Albany lay at some distance with a nu merous army, but made no attempt to attack the English, or to re lieve the capital ; and Henry, who conducted himself with great moderation, in a short time raised the siege, and retired into Eng land. This was the last invasion of Scotland conducted in person by an English monarch. 19. Shortly after the conclusion of this war, the collision between j . yj the prince and his uncle Albany terminated fatally for the ' .im' former. The queen his mother, his father-in-law the Earl J of Douglas, and Trail bishop of St Andrews, whose united wisdom and authority had hitherto restrained the turbulence and licentiousness of the prince, and counteracted the ambitious designs of Albany, had all died within a short period of each other. The king was induced to believe that the excesses of his son required re straint, and the unhappy youth was hurried to Falkland, and shut np in a dungeon, where he was intrusted to the care of two ruffians, who starved him to death. It was at first reported that he had been cut off by dysentery ; but the horrible tale of his sufferings soon after transpired. A poor woman, in passing through the palace garden, had been attracted by his groans, and had found means to support him by thin cakes which she slid into the grated window of his prison, and, it is said, by her own milk, conveyed through a reed ; but she was detected, and put to death by his keepers : and, after fifteen days, the body of the miserable captive was found in a state too shocking to be described. In the extremities of hunger, he had gnawed and torn his own flesh. 20. The truce with England was now ended, and various destruc tive inroads were made by the borderers on both sides. In one of these raids the Scots were defeated by Percy and March at a place called Nesbit Moor in the Merse. Their leader, Hepburn of Hales, was slain, and many of the flower of the knights of Lothian either shared his fate or were taken prisoners. The Earl of Douglas, in censed at this loss, collected an army of ten thousand men, and, along with Murdoch, Albany's eldest son, and the Earls of Moray"], [100, "[A. D. 1407. 82 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and Angus, and many other Scottish barons, invaded England, and laid waste the countiy as far as the gates of Newcastle without op position. They were, however, on their return home, loaded with plunder, intercepted near Wooler by Hotspur and the Earl of March, at the head of a powerful army. The English obtained a complete victory through the mistaken tactics of Douglas, who posted his men on an eminence called Homildon Hill, where they were ex posed to the murderous shafts of the English archers without the power of resistance. The battle was gained entirely by the bow men. Great numbers of the Scots were slain. Douglas, who was wounded in five places, was made prisoner, along with Murdoch the regent's son, the Earls of Moray and Angus, and a great number of knights and esquires. This battle was fought 14th September 1402. It deserves to be mentioned, that a quarrel with the king of Eng land, respecting the disposal of the prisoners taken in this engage ment, led to that celebrated conspiracy of the Percies against Henry IY., which terminated in the battle of Shrewsbury, and the defeat and death of Hotspur. 21. Meantime the Scottish king, becoming apprehensive for the safety of his only surviving son James, then a youth in his fifteenth year, resolved to send him for a season to France, as the safest means of protecting him from his uncle's intrigues. But the vessel in which the }'Oung prince embarked was captured off Flamborough Head by an English cruiser. As a trace at that time subsisted be tween the kingdoms, the capture of the prince was a flagrant breach of the law of nations. But Henry was deaf to all remonstrances and considerations of justice and honour, and resolved to detain at all events the royal hostage. This new disaster completely broke the spirit of the Scottish monarch, and was probably the cause of his death. He died on the 4th of April 1406, in the sixteenth year of his reign ; and Albany, his brother, immediately succeeded to the prize which had long been the object of his ambition, the undis puted regency of the kingdom. 22. The death of Robert HI. made no change in public affairs. The crafty regent continued to govern the country with a view to the consolidation of his own power rather than the promotion of the public good. Soon after the death of his brother, he renewed the league of mutual defence and alliance with France, and entered into negotiations with England for the liberation of the captive Earl of Douglas, who had been taken prisoner by Henry at the battle of Shrewsbury. This powerful nobleman was at length restored to freedom, and, at the same time, a reconciliation was effected be tween him and his enemy the Earl of March, who, at this period, returned to Scotland and obtained the restoration of his immense"], [101, "A. D. 1407.] 83 JAMES I. estates. No effort was made, however, by the regent for the libe ration of his nephew, whose unjust captivity, if it was not caused, was, without doubt, prolonged, by the intrigues of his able but un principled relative. 23. It was at this period that the doctrines of Wickliffe appeared I jj for the first time in Scotland ; and Albany, who was dis ! 1 4__ tinguished for his bitter hatred to all Lollards, manifested L his zeal for the purity of the Romish faith, by kindling the flames of religious persecution in the country. John Resby, an English follower of Wickliffe, was tried before a council of the clergy for disowning the authority of the Pope, and denying the utility of penance and auricular confession ; and, being found guilty, was bar barously condemned to the flames, and executed at Perth in the year 1407. This is the first example of persecution for religious opinions which is recorded in Scottish histoiy ; and, as has usually been the case, this cruel attempt to quench the doctrines of the re formers, served only to strengthen their hold on the popular mind. 24. It was clearly the best policy of the regent to cultivate peace with England, and to conciliate Henry IV., as this prince could at any time put a termination to his authority, by restoring James to his kingdom ; and the same desire to retain the power which he had so nefariously usurped, induced Albany to cultivate the friend ship, and overlook the crimes and excesses of the great feudal barons. All this led to dreadful confusion in Scotland, which, although freed for a time from the incessant invasions of its more powerful neighbour, was torn by private war, whilst the lives and property of its people were exposed to the attack of every unprin cipled feudal baron who sheltered himself under the protection of the regent. 25. At this period, a fierce contest took place between the Celtic and the Lowland population of the country, which threatened the dismemberment of a portion of the kingdom. This was caused by the turbulence and ambition of the powerful chief who, at this time, held the lordship of the isles. Euphemia Countess of Ross having formed the intention of retiring into a convent, resigned the earl dom in savour of her maternal uncle, John Earl of Buchan, son of the regent Albany. But this destination of the property was re sisted by Donald, Lord of the Isles, who claimed the earldom in right of his wife, the sister of the last earl, and aunt of Euphemia the Countess of Ross. The claim, however, was repelled by the regent, who supported the pretensions of the Earl of Buchan ; and Donald, having collected an army of ten thousand Highlanders for the purpose of supporting his right by arms, ravaged the counties of Aberdeen and Moray, and threatened to make a desert of the"], [102, "84 [A. D. 1419. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. country as far as the banks of the Tay. But his progress was re sisted by the Earl of Mar at the head of the Lowland gentry of Aberdeen, Meams, and Angus. The two annies encountered at the village of Harlaw, on the water of Ury. Mar's forces were immensely outnumbered by those of his opponent; but this dis proportion was to a considerable extent compensated by their mar tial skill, and the superiority of their arms and armour. Animated by the old and deep-rooted hostility between the Gael and the Saxons, the armies joined battle with the most inveterate rage and fury. About nine hundred Highlanders fell, together with the chiefs of Macintosh and MacLean. On the side of Mar were slain Sir James Scrymgeour, hereditary standard bearer of Scotland, Sir Robert Davidson, provost of Aberdeen, the sheriff of Angus, with his eldest son, Sir Alexander L-vine of Dram, Sir Robert Maule, Sir Thomas Moray, and above five hundred men-of-arms, includ ing the principal gentry of the district. This fatal engagement, which has fixed itself in the music and poetry of Scotland, was fought on the 24th of July 1411. The victory was doubtful ; but the Lord of the Isles retreated after the action, and next summer was compelled by the regent to lay down his assumed independence, and to become a vassal of the Scottish crown. 26. It is gratifying to be able to turn for relief from these fierce intestine broils to the pleasing spectacle of the establishment of the University of St Andrews, which was founded and endowed under the auspices of Henry Wardlaw, the bishop of that see, to whom belongs the honour of being the founder of the first university in Scotland. The professors of this institution commenced their pre lections in 1410 ; but it was not till 1413 that the papal bulls were received, which endowed the seminary with the privileges of a uni versity. 27. On the death of Henry IV., Albany entered into negotia tions with his successor Henry V., and succeeded in obtaining the liberation of his son Murdoch Stewart in exchange for the young earl of Northumberland, the son of the illustrious Hotspur ; but James, his lawful sovereign, was allowed still to languish in cap tivity. At length, on the 3d of September 1419, Albany died, at the palace of Stirling, at the advanced age of eighty, having govern ed Scotland, under his father, brother, and nephew, for thirty-four years. 28. Murdoch, Earl of Fife, succeeded his father as Duke of Al bany and regent of Scotland. It does not appear, however, that his assumption of the authority and name of governor was sanc tioned by any meeting of parliament, or any council of the nobility. Murdoch was a person of an easy and slothful character, totally"], [103, "A. D. 1424.] JAMES I. 85 destitute of that firmness and prudence which were necessary to go vern the fierce and turbulent people over whom he ruled. Under such a governor, the country was soon turned into one scene of rude unlicensed anarchy. The desire for the return of the king became earnest and universal. Duke Murdoch himself grew weary of ex ercising a feeble sovereignty over a disorderly people and a head strong and unbridled nobility, and entered into negotiations for the freedom of James, with a zeal which speedily brought them to a favourable conclusion. It was agreed that the Scots should pay the sum of forty thousand pounds to defray the expenses of the prince's support and education. Six years were allowed for the discharge of the sum. A marriage was also concluded between the Scottish king and Joanna Beaufort, daughter of the Earl of Somerset, a lady of great beauty and accomplishments, to whom the captive prince had been for some time attached, and whose charms he had cele brated in poetry of no mean order. The day after the marriage James received, as the dowry of his wife, a discharge from the payment of one-fourth part of the stipulated ransom. A truce for seven years was concluded between the two countries ; and James || and his queen, accompanied by a brilliant cortege of Eng ' ' ' lish and Scottish nobles, returned to his own dominions, I 14-^4- where he was received with the greatest joy by all classes of his subjects. 29. The character of James presented a striking contrast to that of his father and grandfather. During the nineteen years in which he had been unjustifiably detained in England, he enjoyed advan tages which almost repaid him for his captivity. Henry the Fourth, a prince who well understood the art of government, had made it his generous care that James should receive an excellent education ; and he had the advantage of being instructed in war, by accom panying his victorious successor, Henry the Fifth, to France. On his return to his own dominions, James was in the prime and the vigour of manhood. His character, formed in the school of adver sity, was one of great power. He found his kingdom a scene of lawless excess and rapine ; a condition to which it had been redu ced from the want of a firm hand to restrain oppression and enforce the laws. Since the death of Bruce the power of the aristocracy had been on the increase, while that of the crown had proportion ally lost ground. The object of James, as can be clearly discerned through the history of his brief reign, was to restore the kingly au thority, to rescue the commons from oppression and plunder, to give security to property, and encouragement to the industry and pacific arts of his people, and to compel his barons to renounce their ideas of individual independence, and become good subjects."], [104, "86 [A. D. 1424. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 30. The regency of Albany, and of his son Murdoch, who had succeeded him, was naturally and justly regarded by James as lit tle else than a long usurpation. He was mortified that Albany, against whom, as the murderer of his brother, he entertained the deepest resentment, should have escaped his merited punishment ; and the royal vengeance fell with a proportionably heavier force upon Murdoch, his son and successor : nor is it possible to deny that James's retribution was cruel and excessive. Murdoch, Duke of Albany, his two sons, the Earl of Athole and Alexander Stewart, and his father-in-law, the Earl of Lennox, a venerable nobleman, eighty years of age, were tried, condemned and executed. James, the duke's youngest son, having made his escape, collected a band of freebooters, and, after sacking and plundering Dumbarton, took refuge in L-eland ; but five of his men fell into the king's hands, and were torn in pieces by wild horses. So horrid a punishment, and the exterminating severity exhibited to all connected with the house of Albany, can admit of no justification ; and there is every reason to believe that the early and miserable death of the monarch, is to be traced to the deep feelings of revenge with which some of his nobles from that moment regarded him. Neither is it possible to believe that the king in this instance carried along with him the feelings of the people. Yet, looking at the state of things in Scot land, it is easy to understand his object. It was his intention to exhibit to a nobility, long accustomed to regard the laws with con tempt, and the royal authority as a name of empty menace, a me morable example of stern and inflexible justice, to convince them that a great change had already taken place in the executive part of the government ; to furnish also a warning to the people, of the punishment which awaited those who imagined that fidelity to the commands of then- feudal lord was paramount to the ties which bound them to obey the laws of their country. 31. Having given this severe and sanguinary lesson, the next ef forts of the monarch were addressed to the internal administration of his kingdom. From without he had nothing to dread ; he was at peace with England, and his marriage with Jane Beaufort, the niece of Cardinal Beaufort, had, from her near relationship to the English monarch, strengthened the ties between the two countries. Fiance was the ancient ally of Scotland, and the Netherlands pro fited too much from the Scottish trade not to be anxious to preserve the most friendly relations. The king could therefore direct his un divided attention to his affairs at home. His great principle, and it was one worthy of so wise a prince, seems to have been a determi nation to govern the countiy through the medium of his parliament. Of these convocations of the national legislature, which had been"], [105, "A. D. 1424.] JAMES I. 87 rarely held under the regency of the two dukes of Albany, no fewer than thirteen occurred during his brief reign, which, dating from his return in 1424, lasted only thirteen years. It is to him that Scotland owes the first clear recognition of the principle of represen tation by the election of the commissaries for shires ; it was by him that one of the greatest improvements was introduced into the ad ministration of justice, by the institution of a court of law known by the name of the Session. Nor was this all. Previously to this time, the laws and the acts of parliament had been published in Latin, and the great majority of the inferior judges to whom their execution was entrusted, were unable to understand them. To remedy this grievance, the king commanded the acts of parlia ment to be drawn up in the spoken language of the land ; an improvement so important, that it forms an era in our legisla tion. Other points of almost equal interest occupied his attention. By his personal presence in the Highlands, and by the military force which he brought along with him, when he visited these re mote districts of his dominions, he introduced laws and order where there had formerly been little else than feudal license and contempt for all authority. 32. Upwards of forty of the Highland chiefs were seized by the king at one time and cast into prison. Several of them, whose crimes had rendered them especially obnoxious, were tried, con demned, and executed ; the rest were suffered to escape with their lives. Alexander of the Isles, the successor of Donald, who fought at Harlaw, was dismissed without punishment, upon his promise to abstain from his habits of lawless turbulence. But this powerful chief had no sooner returned to his own territories, than he collect ed an army of ten thousand men, invaded the mainland, and burnt the town of Inverness. Immediately on receiving intelligence of this outrage, the king assembled an army and hastened to the High lands, where, in Lochaber, he came up with the forces of the island chief, and completely overthrew them. Alexander driven to de spair, was compelled to throw himself upon the royal clemency, which was not granted till he had sued for it upon his knees in the most humiliating manner, and submitted to a long imprisonment in Tan tallon Castle. 33. The submission and imprisonment of their lord did not pre vent the fierce islanders from again rising in rebellion ; and, choos ing for their leader Donald Balloch, a near relation of the Lord of the Isles, they invaded Lochaber, and, encountering the Earls of Mar and Caithness at Inverlochy, totally defeated them with great slaughter. But James instantly marched northwards for the pur pose of inflicting exemplary vengeance on these rebels H'S arrival"], [106, "[A. D. 1424. 88 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. struck terror into the minds of the insurgent chiefs, who hastened in crowds to make their submission, and to entreat pardon. By their means, three hundred of the most noted robbers were seized and executed ; and Donald Balloch, having fled to L-eland, was there slain, and his head sent to the king. 34. Although he cultivated the arts of peace, the king did not forget that the surest preservative of the country was an attention to its military strength. Weapon-shawings, or military musters, were held periodically ; and having witnessed, when resident in England, and in the French wars of Henry V., the great superiority of the Eng lish over the Scotch in archery, he made it his earnest care that his subjects should cultivate this warlike accomplishment. In many of the acts of the various parliaments of this monarch, we can also trace an attention to the encouragement of agriculture, to the interests of fo reign trade and domestic manufactures, to the state of his shipping and navy, to the prices of labour, and to the melioration of the con dition of the labourers of the soil, which clearly demonstrates the high and important objects that occupied the king's mind, although the means he employed were not exactly those which would have suggested themselves to the experience of a more advanced age. Amid these severer duties, James gave an example to his rude ba rons of the cultivation of intellectual accomplishments. He was himself a poet ; and the king's book, or King's Quair, composed during his captivity in England, is still read by many with delight and enthusiasm. He was a reformer of the language of his country ; he composed pieces of music, and sang and accompanied himself on various instruments. It is probable, however, that these employ ments were rather the solace of his tedious confinement in England, than objects of serious pursuit after his return. 35. Having so zealously devoted himself to the best interests of his kingdom, James had the satisfaction to see his measures attend ed with success ; and all seemed secure and prosperous, when he suddenly became the victim of a dark conspiracy. Under circum stances of extreme ferocity he was assassinated in the monastery of the Blackfriars at Perth, by Sir Robert Graham, the Earl of Athole, and some accomplices who had been dependents of the house of Albany. The court was then at Perth, and James had taken up his residence in the Dominican monastery beside the town. The king was betrayed by his chamberlain, Sir Robert Stewart, grand son of the Earl of Athole, who facilitated the entrance of the con spirators, by removing or damaging the locks of the royal apart ments. When the alarm was given, it is said that a lady, named Catherine Douglas, who waited on the queen, thrust her arm into the staple of the door, aud thus, before it was broken, heroically as-"], [107, "WE APON-SHAWINGS\u2014 MILITARY MUSTERS."], [108, ""], [109, "A. D. 1436.] JAMES II. 89 forded a brief interval in which the king contrived to conceal him self in a small vaulted chamber, where for some time he evaded dis covery. The conspirators, under the idea that he had escaped, had dispersed themselves through the palace ; and the unfortunate mo narch might have been safe, if he had not prematurely attempted to leave his concealment. The noise which he made recalled one of the ruffians, who shouted to his companions ; and springing down into the vault, they threw themselves upon their defenceless victim and murdered him, after a desperate resistance. Although conside rable obscurity hangs over the ramifications of the plot which ended thus fatally to the king, there exists no doubt that it owed its ori gin to indignation at the fate of Albany, and those deep feelings of feudal revenge which had been long cherished by the friends of that unhappy house ; affording to princes a terrible lesson of the reac tion which may take place, when justice pushes her punishments beyond example into revenge. 36. James was killed in the forty-fourth year of his age, and in the fourteenth of his reign. He lest by his queen Joanna, an only son, James, his successor, and five daughters, the eldest of whom became queen of France. Three others married into noble families abroad, while the youngest was wedded to the Earl of Angus. 37. Among the transactions of this reign, we must not omit to mention the cruel fate of Paul Crawar, who was burnt for heresy at St Andrews, 23d July 1433. Crawar was a Bohemian physi cian of learning and ability, who had adopted the opinions of John Huss, which he inculcated with great zeal and success. He was tried by Laurence of Lindores, the same cruel and bigoted inquisi tor who sat in judgment on Resby ; and suffered for his principles with the utmost cheerfulness and resolution. d 2"], [110, "90 CHAPTER X.

The death of James I. was a severe calamity to the country, I . -p. exposing it for the third time since the death of Brace, to j 1 ' ' all the evils of a long minority. His eldest son, who suc l 1 ceeded to the throne by the title of James H., was a boy only six years of age ; and although the character of the queen mother was marked by considerable talent and vigour, these qua lities were feeble substitutes for the masculine wisdom, the deter mined courage, and the unwearied care of the late monarch. Her first duty was the arrest and punishment of his murderers ; and this she executed with speedy and immitigable severity. But the death of the king once more gave a licence to the feudal nobles, and of fered them an opportunity of recovering their power, of which they were not slow to avail themselves. 2. Graham, the principal murderer of the late monarch, in the midst of the cruel tortures which preceded his death, had avowed that the day was at hand when the Scottish nobles would venerate his memoiy for having rid them of a tyrant ; and these proud and powerful barons, when they remembered the magnitude of James's plans, and the stern and sometimes unjust severity with which he carried them into execution, could not but feel that now was the time to recover the privileges which they had lost, and to provide"], [111, "A. D. 1436.] 91 JAMES II. some strong and permanent barrier against all future encroach ments of the crown. 3. This observation is the key to the history of the country, not only during the reign of this monarch, but for the next century. It unfortunately happened, that, with the exception of James IV., who on his accession was a youth of seventeen, Scotland was vis ited by a series of minorities in James H., James HI., James V., and Man-, which occupied the long interval between 1436 and 1560 ; and during this period of more than a century, the extraor dinary increase in the power of the nobles, the diminished respect for the crown, and its proportionate weakness against attack and encroachment, are too prominent features to escape notice. We see events, the same in character, and merely varied in name and minor incidents, occurring during the whole time : a monarch of greater or less energy, emerging from his minority, and making an effort to recover the power which he had lost ; a band of turbulent and self ish nobles leagued against him, and only detached from then brethren and persuaded to act with the crown, by an appeal to their interest and their fears. These remarks were strikingly exemplified in the scenes which took place during the minority of James H. 4. Immediately after his coronation, a struggle commenced for the possession of the chief power in the government. In a parliament held at Edinburgh, the queen-mother was entrusted with the cus tody of the young king, while Archibald Earl of Douglas and Duke of Tonraine was appointed lieutenant-general of the kingdom, a title probably including all the powers of a military governor. In civil matters, the chief authority seems to have fallen into the hands of the chancellor Crichton, who had the command of Edinburgh Castle, in which the queen-mother, with the young prince, had taken refuge soon after the murder of her husband. This princess, however, soon found that Crichton turned the possession of the royal person into an engine for his own advancement, and refused to her that frequent intercourse with her son, which she had ex pected, and to which she was entitled. 5. Having combined, therefore, with Sir Alexander Livingston, a baron who had been in favour with her late husband, she contriv ed, by stratagem, to possess herself of the person of the young king, whom she shut up in a large wardrobe chest, and carried as her lug gage to Leith, whence she hastened to Stirling Castle, which had been assigned to her as a jointure-house. 6. The kingdom was now divided between the three factions of the queen and Livingston, who possessed the person of the king, of Sir Alexander Crichton the chancellor, and of the Earl of Douglas, whose immense estates in Scotland, and foreign wealth and influ-"], [112, "[A. D. 1449. 92 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ence as Duke of Touraine, rendered him by far the most formidable baron in the countiy. From this moment to the period when James, having attained majority, began to act for himself, an interval of thirteen years, the history of the nation presents little else than one uniform scene of civil anarchy and unpunished crime. The young monarch beheld his kingdom converted into a stage on which his nobles contended for the chief power ; whilst his subjects were cruelly oppressed, and he himself handed about, a passive puppet, from the failing grasp of one declining faction into the tutelage of a more successful party in the state. In this melancholy drama the chief parts were played by Crichton and Livingston, who, deeming it for their interest to crash the overgrown power of the house of Douglas, inveigled the young earl and his brother into the Castle of Edinburgh, brought suddenly against them a charge of treason, and put them to instant death. 7. It was fortunate for the countiy, that, when thus torn by do r mestic factions, its foreign relations were of a pacific cha | \u2022 \u2022 racter, England, France, and the Netherlands, being all | 1449. animated with the most friendly dispositions ; while the young king, as he advanced from boyhood to maturer years, devel oped a character of prudence, vigour, and intelligence, which ap peared destined to restore a better state of things to his kingdom. Having married the daughter of the Duke of Gueldres, he assumed the government, and selected as his principal councillor Kennedy, bishop of St Andrews, a prelate of great wisdom and integrity, whose rank as head of the church, invested him with an authority to which the people, amid the general corruption, looked with much reverence and affection. It was probably by his advice that James, whose passions were naturally violent, and who viewed with indig nation the arrogance of the Earl of Douglas, engaged in a syste matic plan for the reduction of his overgrown power. Without at tempting at once, and by any arbitrary exertion of strength, to de prive this potent chief of his high offices, a measure which might have been followed by extreme commotion, he gradually withdrew from him his countenance and employment ; surrounded himself by able and energetic councillors, whom he promoted to the principal places of trust ; and thus weakened the authority of the proud baron, rather by the formidable counterpoise which he raised against it, than by any act of open aggression. This conduct was attended with the best results. The Earl of Douglas, finding his consequence decreasing, and his power on the wane, retired for a while from Scotland ; and respect for the character of the monarch increased with the feeling of security derived from an improved administration of the government. During the absence of the chief, James had"], [113, "A. D. 1452.] james ii. 93 time to reduce the minor barons who were his dependents, to attach his own friends more powerfully to his interest, and to concentrate a strength, which, on Douglas's return from Italy, convinced him that he must consent to play a second part to his prince. The re sult was what might easily have been anticipated. A collision took place between this haughty potentate and the young sovereign whose commands he had so often defied. Douglas, naturally Tash and fearless, had consented, under a safe-conduct bearing the royal . _ signature, to visit James in the Castle of Stirling. Af- ' ' ter the royal feast, the king remonstrated with his guest ; disclosed to him the proofs he possessed of his combina tions against the government ; reproached him for the frequent murders of his subjects committed by his order ; and condescended to entreat him to forsake such dangerous courses, assuring him of his pardon and favour. Douglas, instead of embracing the offer, replied to it with haughtiness and insolence ; and James, thus brav ed to his face, losing all command of himself, drew his dagger and stabbed him to the heart. Falling at the king's feet, Douglas was instantly despatched by the nobles who, hearing the commotion, rushed into the apartment. 8. This atrocious murder was followed by a straggle between . -p. the royal party and the friends and vassals of the unfortu- nate baron, in which the king was completely successful. '_ Sir James Douglas, who succeeded his brother in the earl- dom, attempted to brave the monarch, renouncing his allegiance, and throwing himself into the arms of England ; but his projects against his countiy were defeated. He was equally unfortunate in his alliance with the Lord of the Isles, whose naval force he direct ed against the west of Scotland ; and at length, in a fruitless effort to regain his lost power by invading the Merse along with the Earl of Northumberland, he was totally routed by the Earl of Angus, and driven a landless fugitive into England. 9. The remainder of this reign was employed by the king in an endeavour to complete the work which he had begun, by strength ening the power of the crown, and giving security to the persons and property of his subjects, and by attaching to his party the great and influential body of the clergy, carrying into effect various parlia - mentary enactments for the defence of the borders against the at tacks of England, and cultivating the warlike character of his people. Amid these kingly cares, he unwisely suffered himself to be entan gled in the contests between the Yorkists and Lancastrians ; and having espoused the party of Henry VI., levied an army, and met his death by the bursting of one of his own guns at the siege of Roxburgh (1460.) This unfortunate event took place in the twenty"], [114, "LA. D. 1463. 94 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ninth year of his age, and the twenty-fourth of his reign. James left three sons, James his successor, Alexander Duke of Albany, and John Earl of Mar ; and two daughters, Mary and Margaret. 10. The death of a sovereign thus cut off in the prime of his man hood and usefulness, leaving an infant successor, would have been a deep calamity at all times, but was especially so at this moment. James II. had, with uncommon vigour and judgment, reduced the overgrown power of his nobles ; but he died before his plans were matured, leaving the nation at war with England, the seeds of civil disunion ready to spring up, and the more northern parts of the realm held by fierce chiefs, who were disposed, on the slightest . \u201e provocation, to throw off their allegiance. With these island lords, Edward IV. entered into a strict alliance ; and \u2022 the banished Douglases, now become English subjects, agreed to assist him in a confederacy, the object of which was no thing less than the conquest and partition of Scotland. It was to be expected that the favour shewn by that country to the expatri ated monarch Henry VI., should have deeply incensed his rival ; but the facility with which he purchased his instruments, and found them in the ranks of the Scottish nobles, who became the vassals of England, is a mortifying fact. 11. James n. was succeeded by his eldest son, James IH., a child of only eight years of age. The death of the king struck such a damp into the nobles, that they were about to relinquish the siege of Roxburgh, aud disband the army ; but the courage and energy of the widowed queen reanimated then- spirits. On the news of the death of her husband, instead of giving herself up to unavailing grief, she repaired with all speed to the camp before Roxburgh, carrying with her the infant king. Him she presented to the nobles, and urged them for his and his father's sake to press forward the siege. She was obeyed, and Roxburgh was taken ; but fatal dis putes soon succeeded to this success, and it required all the vigour of the queen, with her chief minister, Bishop Kennedy, a man of high character and talent, to straggle against the difficulties which sur rounded them. In the northern parts of the kingdom, all was in disorder ; and the Earl of Ross espousing the cause of Edward IV., proclaimed himself king of the Hebrides, while the Earl of Angus, on whom, after the fall of the house of Douglas, a large share of then- power had devolved, undertook to support the party of Henry VI., contrary to the wishes of the queen and Bishop Kennedy. At \u25a0 7 j. this crisis, the young sovereign lost his mother, Mary of - ' ' Gueldres ; and, after a few years, Bishop Kennedy follow - ! 1 ed her to the grave ; events which deprived the govern- ment of its best support. Yet amid all these complicated dangers,"], [115, "A. D. 1470.] 95 JAMES III. it is remarkable, that for fifteen years, the interval occupied by the minority of this prince, the affaire of the country were prosperous. 12. On the death of Bishop Kennedy, the chief power in the go vernment fell into the hands of William Lord Boyd, the high Jus ticiar, a baron hitherto little known, but whose power rose, in a few years, to a height which almost rivalled that of the once formidable Douglases. He became governor of the king's person ; filled every office with his dependents ; married his eldest son, who was created Earl of Arran, to the king's sister ; and acquired so much influence over the young monarch, rather, it would seem, by terror than by love, that he appeared completely subservient to his wishes. The decay of this family was as sudden as its rise. A marriage had been negotiated between the king and Margaret Princess of Denmark ; and scarcely was it concluded, when a faction of the nobles, at the head of which was the monarch himself, suddenly at tacked the Boyds, arraigned them of high treason, seized and con fiscated their large estates, and brought to the scaffold their princi pal leader. At the command of the king, the Princess Mary aban doned her husband, the Earl of Arran, with whom she had fled to the continent. A divorce was then obtained, and she was compell ed to give her hand to Lord Hamilton, a favourite of the king. It \"T zr | was through this marriage that the family of Hamilton, j ' 'I which now rose into great power upon the ruin of the 1 I Boyds, became, in the subsequent reign of Mary, the near est heirs to the crown. 13. James had now attained majority ; and, in assuming the full administration of the government, he found his kingdom more opu lent, more secure, and more powerful, than could have been antici pated from the straggles of his minority. The important islands of Orkney and Zetland had been acquired by his marriage with the princess of Denmark ; the rich town of Berwick, and the border for tress of Roxburgh, had been regained by the Scots ; the earldom of Ross had been annexed to the crown ; the independence and liberty of the Scottish church had been established by the erection of St Andrews into an archbishopric ; and, lastly, a marriage treaty with England, by which the youngest daughter of Edward TV. was be trothed to the king's eldest son, seemed to promise security and peace in this formidable quarter. If such had already been the success of his minority, it seemed not unreasonable to look forward to still greater prosperity in after years ; and yet the history of the country, from the moment when the monarch attained his majority, presents a melancholy contrast to this commencement of his reign. 14. Some of our historians have represented James IH. as a com pound of indolence, caprice, and imbecility ; but their opinion seems"], [116, "[A. D. 1480 96 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. rash and unfounded. His character was different from that of the age in which he lived ; and in some respects it was far beyond it. The times were rude, warlike, and unintellectual. The king was fond of repose, and addicted to a seclusion in which he might devote himself to pursuits which bespoke a refined and cultivated mind. A passion for mathematics and the study of judicial astrology, a taste for architecture, a love for the science and practice of music, and a generous disposition to patronize the professors of literature and philosophy, rather than to surround himself with a crowd of fierce retainers, were the prominent features in the mind of this unfortu nate prince ; tastes which have been reprobated by contemporary historians, but which, if duly regulated, were rather praiseworthy than the contraiy. Unfortunately, however, this due regulation was wanting. James had the weakness, not only to patronize, but to confer feudal rank and distinctions, hitherto appropriated to the nobles, upon professors of his favourite studies. Architects, musi cians, painters, and astrologers, were admitted to the familiar con verse of the sovereign, while the highest nobles met with a cold reception or a positive denial of access. Is it any matter of sur prise, that a fierce nobility should have been disgusted with such conduct, and should have come to regard the king's warlike bro thers, the Earls of Albany and Mar, as the chief supports of the state ? 15. When such causes of dissatisfaction existed, we need not wonder that dissensions soon broke out ; and, in 1479, we find the king engaged in a contest with his two powerful brothers, Albany and Mar. To the first had been entrusted the wardenship of the east marches, the government of Berwick, and the castle of Dun bar, the principal key of the kingdom ; and there seems no doubt that he had abused his high powers to an extent which bordered upon treason. Against Mar was brought a still moreatrocious charge. He had plotted, it is said, to cause the king's death by magical arts ; and, being convicted by the evidence of his wizard accomplices, was imprisoned, and, according to one account, secretly executed. An other and more probable account ascribes his death to the conse quences of a fever, for which a vein having been opened, he, in an excess of frenzy, tore off the bandages, and bled to death. Against Albany the king proceeded with unusual vigour. He attacked him in Dunbar, made himself master of the fortress, and would have seized his person ; but the rebellious prince availed himself of the situation of the castle, which was open to the sea, and fled first to England, and afterwards to France. 16. At this moment, Louis the Eleventh was at war with Ed ward the Fourth, and unfortunately possessed such influence over"], [117, "A. D. 1482.J JAMES ni. 97 the Scottish king, that he brought about a rupture between James | \u2022\u00a3) and Edward. It was a step signally impolitic. Albany, 1480 the s brother, returning from France, threw himself I 1 into the arms of England ; the nobility were full of com plaints against the government ; the Lord of the Isles embraced the interests of Edward ; and, after a long interval of peace had soften ed the national animosity between the kingdoms, it was a miserable sight once more to witness the renewal of hostilities. 17. This contest led to some extraordinary scenes. Albany hav ing openly avowed his purpose to dethrone his brother, assumed the title of Alexander king of Scotland, and entered into a treaty with Edward, by which he basely consented to sacrifice the independence, and dismember some of the finest portions of the kingdom. To ef fect his designs, he had the address not only to secure the co-opera tion of the banished Earl of Douglas, with the Lord of the Isles and his northern vassals, but he detached from James's service Angus, Gray, Huntly, Lennox, and many others of the leading nobility in Scotland. A conspiracy was formed against the monarch and his favourites ; the conjuncture of his assembling an army, preparatory I . p. to the invasion of England, was deemed the most favour - ' i !&\u2022->' a^e moment for the execution of their purpose ; and, in i the camp at Lander, its success was equally sudden and terrible. The nobles, led by Angus, seized Cochrane, James's fa vourite, who, from a mean station, had been promoted to high rank, and enriched with the earldom of Mar ; they then broke into the king's tent, made him prisoner, arrested the band of ignoble asso ciates who shared his confidence, and proceeded to inflict summary vengeance on them all. Cochrane was hanged over the bridge of Lauder ; Rogers, amusician, Hommel, Leonard, Preston, and others, shared his fate ; and the unfortunate monarch having been convey ed to the capital, was shut up in the castle of Edinburgh. The re sult of this success was what might have been expected. Albany, who all along had acted from motives of personal ambition, having once possessed himself of the king's person, ruled the government at his will. 18. But usurpation of the supreme power was not the full extent of his treachery. He attached Edward IV. to his interests by the sacrifice of the national independence. In a secret treaty, the Eng lish prince engaged to assist Albany, who hitherto had only assumed the title of lieutenant-general of the kingdom, in placing the crown on his own head ; and as the base price of this assistance, the new king and his nobles agreed to withdraw their oaths from James, and to live under the sole allegiance of the king of England. It may give us some idea of the low estate to which the nobles of Scot- E"], [118, "[A.

The plot, however, was defeated ; and happily a party yet remained among the nobles, who, though their vengeance had been directed against the king's favourites, were friends to the crown and to the country. They had joined Albany with the object of sacri ficing Cochrane and his associates, but had been kept in ignorance of his ultimate intentions ; and the moment these became apparent, they united with the king, and overwhelmed the opposite faction. And here, in the manner in which Albany was treated, is to be found the cause of all the subsequent misfortunes of the king. That prince deserved punishment, and ought to have met with no pity. He had been guilty of open and repeated treasons, had levied war against his sovereign, imprisoned his royal person, and leagued him self with his enemies, had sold the independence of his country, and had assumed the title of king. His guilt and ambition had seduced from their allegiance a large party of the nobles ; and, if ever there was a time in which a great example was to be made, that time was now come. Yet, instead of this wholesome severity, the Duke of Albany was treated with a lenity for which it is impossible to ac- I _ count. On acknowledging his manifold treasons, and lay- I ' ' ing down his office of lieutenant-general, he not merely re !____ ceived a full pardon, but was permitted to retain both his vast estates, and his wardeuship of the marches, and was simply in terdicted from coming within six miles of the court, and from con tinuing his illegal combination with Angus, Athole, and Buchan 20. Whether we are to ascribe this misplaced mercy to the king's i , _ attachment to his brother, or to a suspicion that he was j ' ' not strong enough to inflict a more exemplary punishment, I -\"\"d. it is difficult to decide ; but the result demonstrated the foDy of misplaced lenity. In a few weeks Albany was again in re bellion. At his invitation, an English army invaded Scotland ; Dunbar, the most important castle in the kingdom, as the key of the eastern borders, was delivered up by this base person to the enemy, while he himself fled into England, and organized with Ed ward the Fourth the plan of a more formidable invasion. At this crisis occurred the death of the English monarch, and the seizure of the crown by Richard the Third ; events which gave James an in terval of rest, in which he acted with unusual firmness and energy He assembled a parliament at Edinburgh, in which sentence of for feiture was pronounced against the Duke of Albany and all his ad herents ; he entered into an intimate alliance with Charles the"], [119, "A. D. 1483.] JAMES III. 99 Eighth of France ; and he concluded a truce with Richard the Third, who was too much occupied with his own complicated af fairs, to have leisure or inclination to continue the war with Scot land. Thus strengthened, the king found it no difficult matter to resist the last effort of Albany and Douglas, who, having once more invaded Scotland at the head of a small force, were completely defeated at Lochmaben ; an event followed not long after by the death of Douglas, in the abbey of Lindores, where he had been con fined, and of Albany, who was slain in a tournament in France. 21. It might have been expected that James, who was thus deli vered from his most powerful enemies, would have been permitted to reign in peace. But misfortune continued to follow his footsteps ; and, although his nobles had refused to alter the succession in favour of his ambitious brother, they soon after appear to have entered into intrigues with England, for the purpose of placing the crown on the head of his son, the prince of Scotland, who was then a youth in his sixteenth year. Much obscurity hangs over the origin of this conspiracy. Advances seem first to have been made by the faction of the prince to Richard the Third, who, although he was animated by an anxious desire to remain at peace with Scotland, did not scruple to hold out secret encouragement to James's enemies. To what extent such secret negotiations proceeded, it is not easy to discover ; but after the death of Richard they were renewed ; and his successor, Henry the Seventh, shewed as little scruple as his predecessor in encouraging the malcontents. 22. Five years had now elapsed since the death of Cochrane the king's favourite, and the dreadful scenes exhibited in the camp at Lander. Since that time a change appeal's to have taken place in James's character. His devotion to study and retirement had given way to a sense of duty ; he had exhibited not only capacity for go vernment, but unwonted resolution in the attack aud discomfiture of his enemies ; and, although the impolitic lenity with which he had treated Albany was rather a weakness than a virtue, it was believed that he was now convinced of his error, and had resolved that the laws against treason should no longer slumber or be de spised. These reflections filled the barons who had been conspira tors at Lauder with the greatest alarm. They were well aware that a sentence of treason hung over their heads. They knew them selves guilty of aggravated offences ; they had imprisoned the king, usurped the government, and, without regular trial or conviction, had put his favourites and councillors to death. As long as the chief power had remained in then- own hands, they felt tolerably secure, but circumstances had once more restored the king to his wonted authority ; and the dread of the retaliation which might be inflicted,"], [120, "100 [A. D. 1488- HISTORJ OF SCOTLAND. with the certainty that, at all events, their power would be abridged, appears once more to have driven them into rebellion. Such, at least, seems to be the most probable way of accounting for the rise of that conspiracy in which this unfortunate prince lost his crown and his life. The worst feature in the story is the unworthy part acted in it by his son, afterwards James the Fourth, over whom the malcontent barons gained a fatal influence, and who, seduced by the prospect of a crown, lent himself as a tool to the dethronement of his father. When once organized, the plot proceeded to its ma turity, and thence hurried on to its catastrophe, with an appalling rapidity. 23. The two parties of the king and the conspirators first tried - I then mutual strength in a parliament held 13th October ' ' | 1487. It was proposed by the popular faction, that an i amicable adjustment of all disputes should take place be tween themselves and the sovereign, and that such barons as were still obnoxious to a charge of treason, should receive a full pardon. To this the party of the king peremptorily refused their consent. James, aware of the unworthy conduct of his son, the heir appa rent, created his second son Duke of Ross, and seemed to point him out as his successor. He at the same time rewarded the principal barons who had espoused his interest, and took decisive measures, by the appointment of vigorous officers, to have the laws against treason rigidly administered. These steps convinced his opponents that their proceedings had been discovered ; and, without giving the monarch time to assemble an army, or even take measures for his personal defence, they threw off the mask, broke out into open rebellion, declared that James the Third, by his crimes and oppres sions, had forfeited all title to the throne, and proclaimed his son by the title of James the Fourth. 24. Even now, had not the king suffered himself to be misled by his paternal feelings, the conflict might have concluded in his fa vour ; for it is evident that a large class of the nobility, and the whole body of the people, were opposed to these nefarious proceed ings. So strong was this feeling, that James, who, on the advance of the rebels to the capital, had taken refuge in the northern part of his kingdom, soon found himself at the head of a formidable army, and advanced instantly against the insurgents, whom he found sta tioned at Blackness, near Linlithgow. 25. It was now the time for action, the time for a determined I * T) I execution of those laws which late years had seen so con- I ' ' I stantly treated with contempt. But, whether the affec- I '_] tionate heart of the monarch sickened at the sight of his subjects in mortal array against each other, or whether some symp-"], [121, "A. D. 1488.] JAMES in. 101 toms of disaffection breaking out in his own force rendered him ap prehensive of then- fidelity, James not only consented to an accom modation, but offered terms to the prince and his associates, which were culpably lenient. He permitted the son who had usurped his kingly name and prerogative, and the subjects who had defied tho authority of the crown and the laws, to negotiate with arms in their hands on a footing of equality. On the part of the misguided prince, now no longer a boy, no petition for forgiveness, no expres sion of penitence, was suffered to escape. In the pacification at Blackness, the youth spoke throughout, not as a son conscious that he had offended, but as a sovereign transacting a treaty with his equal. The treaty, in truth, was a triumph to the discontented nobles. The prince, and his friends who had encouraged him to resistance, agreed to become obedient subjects on receiving the king's forgiveness ; while the monarch not only consented that their lives, honours, and estates, should be preserved, but that the house hold of the heir apparent should be maintained, and his friends and adherents supported with due dignity. It required little penetra tion to foresee, that the tranquillity which was established on such a foundation could not long subsist. It was a confession of weakness, pronounced at a time when firmness at least, if not severity, was the only guide to the permanent settlement of the convulsions which agitated the kingdom. 26. The consequences which any person of ordinary judgment might have anticipated, were not long of occurring. James retired to his capital, his army was dismissed, and the northern barons, whose valour had saved his crown, were permitted to return to their estates. Anticipating a continuance of tranquillity, the king pro ceeded to reward his friends and reorganise his court, when he re ceived intelligence that his son the prince, with the same fierce barons who had so lately sworn allegiance, were again in arms, and in more formidable numbers than before. In this emergency, the king acted with courage and promptitude ; but having disbanded the strongest division of his army, which consisted of his northern ba rons and their vassals, the force which he mustered was much in ferior to that of his opponents. It was therefore determined to await in the capital the arrival of the northern barons ; but, unfortunately, this resolution was abandoned ; and the monarch with inferior num bers attacked the insurgents, who were commanded by the prince, at Sauchie Burn, within a mile of Bannockburn. The consequences proved most calamitous. The royal forces, after an obstinate strug gle, were routed, and James, escaping from the conflict, was mur dered by an unknown hand at a little hamlet called Milltown, a short distance from the field of battle. James IH. perished in the"], [122, "[A. D. 1488 102 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. thirty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-eighth of his reign. By his queen Margaret, daughter to Christian king of Denmark, he left a family of three sons ; James, his successor ; a second son, also named James, created Duke of Ross and Marquis of Ormond, who ultimately became Archbishop of St Andrews ; and John Earl of Mar, who died without issue. 27. It was some time before the death of the king was ascertain ed ; and it is said his youthful successor was seized with overwhelm ing remorse on being informed of the miserable fate of his father. However this may be, he was immediately proclaimed king ; and the homage of his barons, the early possession of a sceptre, and the lustre of a court, soon stifled his repentant feelings. 28. The character of James the Third, as has been already re marked, has usually been represented by historians as a compound of weakness, wilfulness, and crime ; but this character is contra dicted by the histoiy of his reign. It must, indeed, be admitted, that James's indulgent treatment of his rebellious subjects, and of the prince his son, partook of weakness, although there are few father's hearts in which he will not find an advocate ; but his mis fortunes are to be attributed more to the extraordinary circumstances of the times in which he lived, than to any flagrant vices or defects in the monarch himself. At this period, in almost every kingdom in Europe with which Scotland was connected, the power of the great feudal nobles, and that of the sovereign, had been arrayed in jealous hostility against each other. The time appeared to have arrived when both parties seemed convinced that they were on the confines of a great change ; that the power of the throne must either sink under the superior strength of the greater nobles, or the inde pendence and tyranny of these feudal tyrants receive a blow from which it would not be easy for them to recover. In the different countries of Europe, indeed, the result was not uniform ; but in all, the same elements of faction were seen arrayed against each other. Thus, in France, the straggle under Louis the Eleventh had termi nated in favour of the crown ; yet the example of resistance to the monarch was not lost upon the Scottish nobility, who were in con stant communication with that countiy. In Flanders and the States of Holland, they had before them the spectacle of an independent prince deposed and imprisoned by his son ; and, in Germany, the reign of Frederick the Third, who was contemporary with James the Third of Scotland, presented one constant scene of struggle be tween the emperor and his nobility, in which that capricious po tentate was uniformly defeated. 29. There is yet one other observation to be made upon this re markable revolution, by which, for the first time in Scottish history."], [123, "A. D. 1488.] JAMES III. 103 a king was solemnly deposed by a faction of his own subjects. Although the barons who led the successful faction represented themselves as the friends of liberty, driven to a resistance of royal oppression, the middle classes and the body of the people took no share in the straggle. Many individuals belonging to these classes, who were feudal vassals of the great lords, must, no doubt, have been compelled to serve under them ; but, as far as they were re presented by the commissaries of burghs who sat in Parliament, they appear in this straggle to have joined the party of the sove reign and the clergy, by whom, during this reign, frequent efforts were made to introduce a more effectual administration of justice, and a greater respect for property and the rights of individuals. 30. Laws, mingled with alternate threats and exhortations, are to be found upon these subjects in the records of each successive parliament of this reign ; but the offenders continued refractory, aud these offenders were the very men, whose offices, if conscien tiously administered, ought to have secured the rights of the great body of the people. It was the nobles who were the justiciars, chancellors, chamberlains, sheriffs ; and these, it was well known, were often the worst oppressors, partial and venal in their admini stration of justice, severe in exacting obedience, and opposed to every right which interfered with their own power. Their privi leges as feudal nobles came repeatedly into direct collision with their duties as servants of the government, and they made no scruples to sacrifice the last for the preservation of the first ; duty to privilege and self-interest. It is from this cause that we discern an honourable distinction between the clergy and the feudal nobles, in the straggle between the crown and the faction by which it was attacked. In this contest, wherever the greater offices in the go vernment were in the hands of the clergy, it will be found that they generally supported the sovereign ; when they were entrusted to the nobility, they almost uniformly combined against him."], [124, "( 10* ) CHAPTER XI.

When James the Fourth succeeded to the throne left vacant by the murder of his father, he was in his seventeenth year ; but his character at that early age had vigorously developed itself ; and, although it has sometimes been asserted, there is no reason to believe that the prince had been an unwilling assistant, or a passive tool, in the hands of the conspirators. Then- first care was to hold at Scone the ceremony of the coronation ; then; next to conclude a three years' truce with England, then under the government of Henry the Seventh ; their third, to assemble a parliament and provide for then- own safety, by the forfeiture of then enemies, and rewards dis tributed to their friends. 2. Here it is not unimportant to mark the course which they art fully pursued. If any party in the state were at this time liable to a charge of treason, it was evidently the friends of the young king, and not the barons who had continued faithful to his father ; but the difference consisted in this, that the treason of the prince's party had been accompanied with success, whereas the resistance of the friends of the late king had been overwhelmed, and himself de throned and murdered. They who were now in possession of the supreme power, therefore, boldly turned the tables on their oppo nents, summoned them on a charge of treason, and, as the facts were notorious, pronounced sentence against them. They next voted then own acquittal in strong and significant terms ; and, con sidering under whose dictation the act was drawn up, it is difficult to read, without a smile, the compliments pronounced upon their treason, when they declare that then- sovereign lord, and his true barons, who served with him in the field, were innocent of the late"], [125, "A. D. 1489.] 105 JAMES IV. battle and pursuit, and had no blame in exciting the disturbances which had terminated so fatally. 3. The innocence of these barons was, however, far from being jj generally admitted ; and the parliament had scarcely ter- 1489 rnmatec' ft*3 sittings, when Lennox, Huntly, Marischal, and L other powerful chiefs, rose in arms to avenge the death of the king. Lord Forbes, who had joined them, marched through the country, bearing the bloody shirt of the unfortunate king suspended from a spear ; and, had it not been for the promptitude with which their opponents met the enterprise, the movements of Lennox, who advanced upon Stirling, might have delivered the country from their domination. Bnt this chief, betrayed by some of his followers, was surprised and completely routed by Lord Drammond at Tallamoss ; Dumbarton, Lennox's strongest hold, surrendered ; and the defeat added new strength to the young king and his friends. 4. Tranquillity being restored, James, as he approached manhood, exhibited signs of considerable ability and energy in following up his plans. Amid a love of pleasure, which had never been restrain ed by early discipline, and which often hurried him into foolish and criminal excesses, he did not so far forget himself as to neglect his higher duties. He cultivated amicable relations with England, re newed the league with France, entered into a commercial alliance with Denmark, and, in a parliament held in the capital, directed Ms earnest endeavours to the establishment of good order, and the administration of equal justice throughout the kingdom. Happily the character of Henry the Seventh, his caution, sagacity, com mand of temper, and earnest desire for peace, were well calculated to check the ardour and impetuosity of the Scottish prince ; and for twenty years, with the exception of a brief effort made by James in favour of Perkin Warbeck, the country enjoyed the blessing of repose. 5. This interval was wisely occupied by the monarch in reducing the northern portion of his dominions to obedience, and in an at tempt, by the frequent convocation of his parliament, to promulgate useful laws, and (which proved a more difficult task) to enforce their observance. It was evident, that, as the king grew older, he became convinced of the fatal errors of his early years, and upbraid ed himself for having lent himself to a selfish and unprincipled fac tion, who, unless he consulted their wishes and gratified then- am bition, might be disposed to treat him as they had treated his fa ther. Aware that they were too powerful to be quelled, he pru dently adopted a safer course, by gradually recalling to confidence and power the friends and ministers of his father. Among these, one of the ablest was Andrew Wood of Largo. This remarkablu"], [126, "106 [A. D. 1490. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. man, whose genius for naval adventure was combined with a power ful intellect in civil affairs, rose by degrees to be one of James's most confidential servants, and appears to have been almost exclusively trusted in his financial concerns. We find in him many qualities apparently inconsistent, when judged by modem notions. He was originally nothing more than an enterprising merchant ; but at this time all merchant snips were armed, and generally acted on an em ergency as ships of war. Wood, therefore, in the course of a life devoted to commercial adventure, had become a skilful naval com mander ; and, in the commencement of this reign, when the English privateers infested the narrow seas and attacked the Scottish ship ping, had signalized himself by the capture of five vessels, and the subsequent defeat of a second squadron, commanded by Stephen Bull, a London merchant. These successes endeared him to the king, who had a passion for naval enterprise, and lost no opportu nity of encouraging such a taste in his nobles. The advice of such a councillor as Wood was of essential service to James. His travels in different countries had enlarged his mind, and made him ready to adopt their improvements in various points in which Scotland was behind her neighbours. He had been an affectionate servant of the late king ; and to his advice we are perhaps to trace the coldness and severity with which James now began to treat some of the lead ers in the late rebellion. Yet, while the monarch endeavoured to keep then- power in check, he shewed his prudence in abstaining from such severe measures as might have driven them into opposition ; and, combining firmness with gentleness, he contrived to reconcile the opposite factions among his nobles, and to maintain his own au thority over them all. 6. In the midst of these cares, the state of the Highlands occu pied his special attention, and the principles of his policy were cer tainly wise and salutary. He endeavoured, by eveiy means in hia power, to attach to his interest the principal chiefs of these remote districts ; he contrived, through them, to overawe and subdue the petty island princes who affected independence ; he carried into their territories, which had been hitherto too exclusively governed by their own capricious and often tyrannical institutions, a more regular and rapid administration of civil and criminal justice, mak ing them obedient to the same laws which regulated his lowland i . p. dominions ; and, lastly, he repeatedly visited the Highlands I ' \" in person. In 1490, on two different occasions, the king I '_ rode from Perth across the \" Mount,\" a term applied to the chain of mountains which extends from the Mearns to the head of Loch Rannoch, accompanied by his chief lords and councillors"], [127, "A. D. 1495.] JAMES IV. 107 In 1493, he twice penetrated into the Highlands, and in the suc ceeding year thrice visited th'e isles. 7. One of these voyages, undertaken in 1494, during the spring months, was conducted with great state. He was accompanied by his chief ministers, his household, and a considerable fleet, many ot i tj the vessels composing which were fitted out by the nobles j 14Q4 at tne'r ovra esPense- The pomp of tins armament was I J well calculated to impress upou such wild districts an idea of the wealth and military power of the king ; while the rapidity of his progress, the success with which he punished all who braved his power, his generosity to those who sued for mercy, his familiarity with the lower classes of his subjects, and his own gay manners, in creased his popularity, and confirmed the ties of allegiance. On arriving, in this voyage, at Tarbert in Kentire, James repaired the fort originally built there by Brace, established an emporium for his shipping, transported thither his artillery, and, by such wise and energetic precautions, ensured peace to districts which formerly had derided the royal vengeance. The chiefs, aware that the king could carry hostilities at a short warning into the heart of their territo ries, submitted to a force which it would have been vain to re sist. One only, the Lord of the Isles, had the folly to defy the royal vengeance, and soon repented his temerity. He was summon ed to take his trial for treason, pronounced guilty, and stripped of his almost regal power ; and his lands and possessions were forfeit ed to the crown. 8. We must now advert for a moment to a singular episode in the history of the country. Perkin Warbeck, whose mysterious story still offers some field for historical scepticism, after his first , -p. j unsuccessful attempt upon the English crown, took refuge ' I in Scotland in the year 1495. There seems strong ground I for suspecting that James, at the request of the Duchess of Burgundy, had embraced the interests of this adventurer at a much earlier period than is generally supposed ; but, whether he really believed him to be the prince whose name he assumed, or whether he was induced to espouse his cause as a means of weak ening England, is not easily discoverable. It is certain, however, that, in 1494, the Scottish king had projected an invasion of Eng land in favour of the Duke of York, and that the plan miscarried by the treachery of Perkin's friends. 9. On the arrival of the mysterious stranger at his court, James at once received him with royal honours, gave him in marriage Catherine Gordon, the daughter of the Earl of Huntly, a lady con nected with the royal family, collected an army, and, attended by Warbeck, invaded Northumberland. But the proceeding was rash"], [128, "[A. D. 1497 108 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and impolitic ; and its author found, within a short time, that the jause of Perkin was unpopular in England, and the war unaccept able to his own subjects. So deep was the antipathy between the two nations, that the English no sooner saw the claimant of the crown invading their country at the head of a Scottish force, than they suddenly cooled in their enthusiasm ; and the desolating fury with which James, supported by a body of foreign mercenaries, con ducted hostilities, completed their disgust. It became evident to the king that Henry the Seventh held his crown by a tenure too firm to be shaken by so feeble a hand as that of Perkin. He there- I * t\\ I f\u00b0re withdrew his army, and soon after concluded a trace I '\u25a0 I with England, refusing, however, to deliver Perkin to I I Henry, and taking measures for his quiet and amicable re treat from Scotland. 10. These negotiations having been concluded, James had leisure to attend to his affairs at home. He was aware that the chief errors of his father's reign were to be traced to his neglect of the great body of his nobility. To reign without their cordial co-operation was impossible, so long as Scotland remained a feudal kingdom ; and it was happy for this prince that the course of conduct which his own disposition prompted him to pursue, was the best calculat ed to render him a favourite with this influential body. Under the reign of his father, the nobles had little intercourse with their prince. They lived in gloomy independence, at a distance from court, re sorting thither only on occasions of state or counsel ; and, when parliament was ended, or the emergency had passed away, they re turned to their castles full of complaints against a system which made them strangers to their sovereign, and ciphers in the govern ment. 11. All this was happily changed under the present monarch. Affable in his manners, a lover of magnificence, and a still greater lover of mirth and pleasure, the prince delighted to see himself en circled by a splendid nobility. He bestowed upon his highest ba rons those offices in his household which ensured their attendance upon his person ; his court became a scene of perpetual amusement, in which his nobles laboured to surpass each other in extravagance and revelry ; and while they impoverished themselves, they became more dependent upon the sovereign. In this manner, the seclu sion of their own castles became irksome to them ; as their resi dence on their estates was less frequent, the ties which bound their vassals to their service were loosened ; and the consequences prov ed in every way favourable to the royal authority. 12. James now turned his principal attention to his navy. It is well known, that at this time the maritime enterprises of the Por-"], [129, "A. D. 1500.] JAMES rv. 109 tuguese, and the discoveries of Columbus, had created a wonderful sensation throughout Europe. Even the cautious and calculating spirit of Henry the Seventh had caught fire at the triumphs of na val enterprise ; and an expedition which sailed from England under the command of John Cabot, a Venetian merchant, and his son Sebastian, was rewarded by the discovery of North America. These successes roused the adventurous spirit of the Scottish king ; and, as Scotland had hitherto been deficient in any thing approach ing to a navy, he became eager to supply the want, and maintain his place with other maritime kingdoms. With this view, he paid great attention to his fisheries, and to foreign commerce, the best nurseries of seamen ; and those enterprising merchants and hardy mariners who had hitherto speculated solely on their own capital, found themselves encouraged by the king and the government. 13. In a former parliament, complaints had been made of the want of boats to be employed in the fisheries, and of the wealth lost to the country from the few ships to be found in its sea-ports. It was now provided that vessels of twenty tons and upwards should be built in all the principal sea-ports, and that all stout vagrants found in these districts should be impressed, and compelled to learn the trade of mariners. Among his merchants and private traders were many men of ability, whom the king treated with favour. He exhorted them to extend their voyages, to arm their trading ships, to import artillery, and to build ships of force at home. Nor was this all. He studied the subject of his navy, and made him self personally familiar with its details ; he practised gunnery, em barked in little experimental voyages, conversed with his mariners, and visited familiarly at the houses of his merchants and sea-officers, by whom his fame was carried to foreign countries. All this was useful. The best foreign artisans, being sure of a generous recep tion, flocked to Scotland from France, Italy, and the Low Coun tries ; and, if the king's credulity sometimes encouraged impostors, his enthusiasm also collected round him men of real knowledge and experience. 14. While we advert to these laudable exertions of the king, the labours of an enlightened prelate for the dissemination of useful learning, ought not to be passed over. Scotland, at this period, possessed only two universities, St Andrews, founded in the begin ning of the fifteenth century, and Glasgow, founded in 1463. To these, Elphinstone, bishop of Aberdeen, now added a third. The papal bull was issued in 1494, but the buildings of King's College were not completed till about the year 1500. It supported professors of divinity, of the civil and canon law, of medicine, and of classical literature, in which its first principal, Hector Boece or Boyce, was"], [130, "LA. D. 1509. 110 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. no contemptible proficient. Soon after this, James married the . y. princess Margaret of England, daughter of Henry the Se- ' ' venth ; a wise and politic alliance, although, in the mar- ' riage treaty, the diplomatic skill and penurious habits of the English king seem to have gained a victory over the Scottish commissioners. 15. From the public rejoicings that followed his nuptials, the king was called to repress a rebelUon in the north, Which appears . \u201e I to have been excited by an imprudent alteration in the * \" policy hitherto pursued in these quarters. This had led '_ to a confederation of the Highland chiefs, who determined to reinstate in his insular sovereignty the grandson of the last Lord of the Isles ; and so deep was the discontent, that it required the utmost efforts of the king to restore the remote districts to tranquil lity. In this he at last succeeded, by dividing them into new she riffdoms, repairing and garrisoning the castles in the hands of the crown, and sending Wood and Barton, two of his best officers, with a small squadron to co-operate with Arran, his lieutenant-general, in reducing the insurgent chiefs. Having adopted these measures, which were soon followed by the complete re-establishment of tran quillity, James, at the head of a considerable force, visited the bor der districts, and, assisted by Lord Dacre, the English warden, compelled the Armstrongs, the Jardines, and other powerful septs, to forsake their habits of plunder, and respect the laws. He then proceeded by negotiations to strengthen his pacific relations with France and the Netherlands ; while he prudently resisted the soli citations of Pope Julius the Second, who endeavoured to detach him from his alliance with Louis, and to induce him to join the em peror and the Venetians in their attempt to check the successes of the French in Italy. 16. Not long after this, occurred the death of Henry the Seventh, . \u201e I an event unfavourable to Scotland. The proud, capri- 1 ' ' cious, and tyrannical character of his son and successor '_ Henry the Eighth rendered him little qualified to respect or preserve the pacific relations with that country, which had been wisely cultivated by his father ; and it soon appeared that the Scot tish prince, a spirited monarch, jealous of his own dignity, and lit tle accustomed to dictation, was not disposed to submit to it from his brother-in-law. 17. Matters proceeded smoothly for some time ; but when Henry the Eighth engaged in war with France, the ancient ally of Scot land, James at once warmly espoused the party of Louis, and, al though against the best interests of his kingdom, suffered himself to be drawn into the quarrel. The histoiy of the war is well known,"], [131, "A. D. 1513.] JAMES rv. 111 Julius the Second having, in conjunction with Ferdinand of Spain, gained all he wished, by the league of Cambray, became alarmed at the progress of the French in Italy, and, to check their aims, prevailed upon Henry the Eighth, whose imagination had lately been dazzled by the recollection of the brilliant conquests of Edward the Third and Hemy the Fifth, to invade France. Louis, on the other hand, negotiated with James the Fourth, and, to embar rass the king of England, induced him to declare war against Hen ry the Eighth. It was a fatal resolution ; but the Scottish prince was so beloved by his people, and so popular with his nobles, that his appeal to arms was answered by the muster of one of the most nu merous and best equipped armies, and one of the most formidable fleets ever fitted out by the countiy. 18. The fleet amounted to twenty-three sail, of which thirteen were large ships, the rest small armed craft. Of this armament the destination was Ireland ; but its command was entrusted to the Earl of Arran, an officer of no experience in naval affaire ; and the re sult was its total dispersion and discomfiture. The land army, on the other hand, which was led by the king in person, amounted to little short of a hundred thousand men. With this formidable force James invaded England, and, after some slight successes, en camped on the hill or rising ground of Flodden, one of the last and lowest eminences which detach themselves from the range of the Cheviots. It was a strong position, impregnable on each flank, and in front defended by the Till, a deep and sluggish stream, which is tributary to the Tweed. 19. Henry the Eighth, before passing with his army into France, had entrusted the defence of his kingdom to the Earl of Surrey, a brave and experienced officer, who lost no time in collecting a force, with which, although it did not amount to half the number of the I , n Scots, he did not hesitate to march against the king. Bnt ' ' what he wanted in numbers, Surrey supplied by military I j experience and coolness ; while James, blind, obstinate, and attending only to the dictates of his personal courage, threw away his advantages both of numbers and position. The result was one of the most calamitous defeats ever experienced before or since by Scotland. Surrey was permitted by the king to cross the Till in the face of his army. Contrary to the remonstrances of his veteran officers, he would suffer no one to attack him ; although the moment was so favourable, that, if Angus, Lindsay, and Huntly had been allowed to charge with their men, nothing less than a miracle could have saved the English earl. To the entreaties of Borthwick, the master of his artillery, he was equally obstinate. Had the guns been brought to bear upon the enemy when crossing the bridge of"], [132, "[A. D. 1513. 112 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the Till, they must either have been beaten back or thrown into such disorder as would have exposed them to immediate rout ; but this too the king would not suffer. With amazing folly, he renoun ced the use of his artillery (that arm of war which, with so great care and expense, he had strengthened or rather created) at the very moment it became serviceable, and might have saved himself and his army. What James's motive was in this, unless the indulgence of some idle chivalrous punctilio, it is impossible to discover ; but its consequences were grievous. Surrey completed his arrange ments, passed the ford and the bridge, marshalled his army at lei sure, and, placing his entire line between James and his country, advanced by an easy ascent upon the rear of the Scottish army. Upon this the king set fire to the huts and temporary booths of his encampment, and descended the hill, with the object of preoccupying an eminence on which the village of Brankston is built. His army was divided into five battles, some of which had assumed the form of squares, some of wedges, all being drawn up in a line about the distance of a bow-shot from each other. The enemy were divided into two battles, each of which had two wings. The English van was led by lord Thomas and lord Edmund Howard, Surrey himself commanded the centre of the host, and Sir Edward Stanley and Lord Dacre the rear and the reserve. On the side of the Scots, Huntly and Home led the advance, the king the centre, and the Earls of Lennox and Argyle the rear. The battle commenced at four in the afternoon, and, after an obstinate contest, which con tinued till nightfall, concluded in the total defeat of the Scots. Among the slain was, besides thirteen earls, and fifteen lords and chiefs of clans, the king himself, who, surrounded by a circle of his nobles, had fought with desperate courage. The loss of common soldiers was estimated at ten thousand men. Of the gentry it was impossible to say how many were slain. Scarcely a family of note could say that they had not lost one or more relatives, while some had to lament the death of all their sons. Whether we regard this miserable slaughter of the sovereign, with the flower of his nobility and countiy, or look to the long and sickening train of national ca lamities which it entailed upon the kingdom, it is not too much to pronounce the battle of Flodden the greatest national misfortune ever experienced by Scotland. 20. The character of the unfortunate monarch who thus perished in the prime of life (for James had not completed his forty-second year), was marked by very contradictory qualities. Although de voted to pleasure, wilful, and impetuous, he was energetic and in defatigable in the administration of justice, a patron of all the use ful arts, and laudably zealous for the introduction of law and order"], [133, "A. D. 1513.] james v. us into the remotest parts of his dominions. The commerce and the agriculture of the country, the means of increasing the national se curity, the navy, the fisheries, the manufactures, were all subjects of interest to him ; and his genuine kindness of heart, aud accessi bility to the lowest classes of his subjects, rendered him deservedly beloved. Yet he plunged needlessly into the miseries of war ; and his thirst for individual honour, and an obstinate adherence to his own judgment, led to the sacrifice of his army and his life, aud once more exposed the kingdom to the complicated evils of a minority.

The news of defeat always fly rapidly, and the full extent of . yj the national calamity soon became known in the capital, ' ' which was seized with the utmost sorrow and terror. The I L magistrates, with the forces of the borough, had joined the king's army, and many of them shared his fate ; but the merchants, to whom their powers had been deputed, acted with much firmness and spirit. They armed the townsmen, published a proclamation, enjoining the women, who were seen waning in the streets, to cease their lamentations and repair to the churches, where they might pray for then; lords and husbands, and took all the necessary pre cautions to defend the city in the event of any immediate attack. Soon afterwards, the welcome intelligence arrived that Surrey, hav ing suffered severely in the battle, had disbanded his host ; and a breathing interval was allowed. The infant king was crowned at Scone, the castle of Stirling appointed as his residence, the govern- e 2"], [134, "[A. D. 1513. 114 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ment of it entrusted to Lord Borthwick, and the Archbishop of Glas gow, with the Earls of Huntly and Angus, selected to be the coun cillors of the queen-mother, till a parliament should assemble. At the same time, suspicions seem to have arisen that too much influ ence in the government ought not to be given to this princess, whose near connection with England might subject her to foreign influ ence ; and a secret message was dispatched to France, inviting the Duke of Albany, the next heir to the throne, to repair to Scotland, and assume the office of regent. 2. It was necessary, in the meantime, to consider the best schemes for the restoration of tranquillity and the preservation of order under the shock which a defeat so terrible had given to the country ; and the prospect which presented itself on taking a gene ral view of the condition of the kingdom, was far from encouraging. The dignified clergy, a class of men who were undoubtedly the ablest and the best educated in Scotland, and from whose ranks the state had been accustomed to look for its wisest councillors, were divided into factions among themselves, occasioned by the vacant benefices. The Archbishop of St Andrews, the Prelates of Caithness and the Isles, and other ecclesiastical dignitaries, had fallen in the field of Flodden ; and the intrigues of the various claimants for these high prizes distracted the church and the council. There were evils also to be dreaded from the character and youth of the queen mother. Margaret had been married at fourteen, and was now only twenty-four. Her talents were excellent, as we know from the tes timony of such able judges as Surrey, Dacre, and Wolsey ; but in some points she too nearly resembled her brother Henry the Eighth. She was hasty in her resentment, headstrong, and often ready to sacrifice her calmer judgment to her passion or her plea sure ; and, in her thirst for power or personal gratification, she sometimes cared little for the purity of the means by which these objects were accomplished. Soon after the death of the late king, she gave birth to a son, who was named Alexander, and created Duke of Ross ; and in a parliament, which met after her recovery, she was confirmed in the office of Regent, and entrusted with the custody of the young king and his brother. 3. At this moment the most powerful nobles in Scotland were the Earls of Angus, Home, Huntly, and Crawford. Angus wielded the whole strength of the house of Douglas ; Home was Chamberlain, and commanded the eastern borders ; while Huntly and Crawford ruled the northern districts. The Earl of Arran, in the meantime, arrived from France, along with the Sieur de la Bastie, who had been a favourite of the late king, and brought a message from the Duke of Albany. Arran was nearly related to the Royal family,"], [135, "A. D. 1513.] JAMES V. 115 and entitled, by Ms high birth, and the office of Lord High Admiral which he held, to act a leading part in the government ; but his ta lents were of an inferior order, and unequal to the trying circum stances in which the country was placed. 4. Scarcely had the queen recovered from her confinement when she married the Earl of Angus, a nobleman of great accomplishments and personal attractions, but, in the words of Lord Dacre, \" childish, young, and attended by no wise councillors.\" Had the princess entered into a second marriage after due consultation had been held with the council assigned to her by parliament, and after a decent interval, no one could have blamed her. She was yet in the bloom of her best years, and from her youth, as well as her high rank and the important duties entrusted to her, she required the protection of a husband ; but the precipitation with which she hurried into the match with Angus was scarcely decorous, and certainly unwise, nor was it long before she bitterly repented her choice. 5. The first effect of this unfortunate step was to increase the bitterness of the pre-existing feuds amongst the nobles. Home and Angus marshalled themselves and their vassals against each other ; Arran, assisted by Lennox and Glencairn, aspired to the regency ; Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow, an intriguing prelate, supported the interests of Albany and the French faction ; while Huntly, Lord Drummond, and the Earl Marischal, gave their influence to Angus and the queen, who courted Henry the Eighth, and took the name of the English party. At this unfortunate crisis, the countiy re ceived a new blow in the death of Elphinstone, who had been nomi nated Archbishop of St Andrews. For the vacant primacy there were three competitors ; Gawin Douglas, uncle to the Earl of Angus, Hepburn, Prior of St Andrews, and Forman, Bishop of Moray, re spectively nominated by the queen, the chapter, and the pope. These ambitious ecclesiastics scrupled not to muster their armed vassals, and to vindicate their claims by an appeal to the sword, an indecent spectacle, which could not fail to lower the church iii the eyes of the people. 6. It was under this deplorable state of things that Henry VIII. carried to perfection a base system already begun by bis father, that of keeping in pay a number of spies and pensioned supporters. He bribed the Scottish nobles, maintained a constant correspondence with the queen his sister, and even went so far as to propose her flight with the young king and his brother to the English court. It may give us some idea of the loose principles of some of the leading men, to know that Angus, and his uncle Gawin Douglas, who ranks higher as a poet than a politician, did not hesitate to give their countenance to a plan which amounted to nothing short of treason."], [136, "[A. D. 1521. 116 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 7. In the midst of these scenes the Duke of Albany arrived from France, and assumed the regency ; but, unfortunately, his deter mined predilection for the French interests was as unacceptable to many of the wisest and best men in the countiy, as the devotion of the queen and Angus to England. At this moment Scotland re quired an upright and vigorous governor, animated by a sincere love of his country, and who could hold the balance with judgment be tween contending parties. But Albany was ignorant of the consti tution, of the language, and of the manners of the country. His family also made him an object of suspicion, his father having traitorously attempted to seize the crown. He was the son of a French mother, had married a French woman, and having his chief estates in France, constantly styled the French king his master ; nor does it appear that either his talents or his temper were calcu lated to counterbalance such disadvantages. 8. On his assumption of the government the effects of all this were soon perceived. The queen refused to give up the custody of the infant monarch ; Home, the chamberlain, threw himself into the arms of England ; Angus, guided solely by selfishness and the am bition of becoming chief ruler, deserted his wife, the queen. France, instead of assisting her ancient ally to defeat the intrigues of Henry VOL, which were carried on by his able minister Lord Dacre, first betrayed strong symptoms of a change of policy, and at length re fused to renew the alliance with Scotland ; and although Albany, amid these difficulties, acted with considerable spirit and ability, it was impossible for him to compose the jarring elements, or restore tranquillity and order to the countiy. 9. Dissatisfied and dispirited, he retired for a few years to France, and returned to Scotland only to find the dangers which threatened the kingdom more imminent, and the task of encountering them more difficult. In his absence, De la Bastie, the person who en joyed his chief confidence, and to whom he had entrusted the offices of warden of the marches and deputy-governor, was murdered by the Homes in the most savage manner. The Highlands and Isles, long deprived of regular government, were torn by various factions, and exhibited scenes of the wildest excesses ; and Angus, whose feudal power was far too great for a subject, had acted in open de fiance of the laws, and domineered in the most tyrannical manner over all who dared to oppose his commands. The arrival of Albany A. D. conlPelled this chief to flee from the capital, and the regent 1521 exerted himself with the utmost vigour to put down the 1 despotism of the Douglases. He was forthwith reconciled to the queen, received from her the keys of the castle of Edinburgh, and with them the custody of the young king ; he assembled a par-"], [137, "A. D. 1522.] 117 JAMES V. liament, summoned the Douglases to answer a charge of treason, and, although thwarted in his administration by the intrigues of Lord Dacre, and the treachery and venality of the Scottish nobles, he compelled Angus, his principal enemy, to leave the kingdom. 10. It would be difficult, and, if easy, uninstructive, to enter mi nutely into the history of this period, when the countiy was torn by contending factions, and exposed to all the miseries incident to a feudal minority. Albany's worst enemies were Lord Dacre and the Anglo-Scottish party which he kept in his pay. It was his policy to throw distrust and suspicion upon every measure of the regent and the queen ; to represent the former as avaricious and tyranni cal, to accuse him of a design to seize the crown, and to insinuate that the king's life was not safe in his custody. All of these tales are to be found in his correspondence with his master Hemy VIII. ; and there can be little doubt that the greater portion of them were false, and the whole grossly exaggerated. 11. The English monarch, acting upon the impulse of the mo- -pj ment, and thwarted by the politic measures of the regent, - . \u201e\u201e dispatched a herald, who conveyed a severe reprimand to \" the queen, and, at the same time, insisted that the Scottish nobles should instantly dismiss Albany. Their reply to this haughty communication was spirited and dignified. They derided the fears expressed for the Use of the young king, declaring that Albany was a faithful servant of the country, and had been invited by themselves to assume the regency. \" Here it is our pleasure,\" said they, \" that he shall remain, nor shall he be permitted or enjoined to depart at the request of your grace, or any other sovereign prince. And as to the threat of hostilities\" (thus they concluded their answer), \" if, becanse we assert our own rights, we should happen to be invaded, what may we do but trust that God will espouse our just quarrel, and demean ourselves, as our ancestors have done before us, who, in ancient times, were constrained to fight for the conservation of this realm, and that with good success and honour ?\" 12. This answer was followed, on the part of Henry, by an im mediate declaration of war. The Earl of Shrewsbury, at the head of the force of the northern counties, invaded Scotland on the side of the Merse and Teviotdale ; an English fleet ravaged and laid waste the coasts of the Frith of Forth ; and Albany the regent re taliated by breaking into England at the head of a large army. He was driven to this solely by a desire to vindicate the national ho nour ; for he seems to have been conscious of the disadvantages which attended a war with England, and he knew that the majo rity of the nobles were animated by the same feelings. Under these circumstances, he wisely determined to follow Brace's prac-"], [138, "[A. D. 1523. 118 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. tice of avoiding protracted invasion, and not hazarding a general battle ; and while he shewed a determination to maintain the inde pendence of the country, and to resist any foreign dictation, he evinced, at the same time, his readiness to conclude an honourable peace. 13. The same disposition being evinced by Lord Dacre, the mi nister to whom Henry intrusted the management of Scottish affairs, a truce was concluded ; but Albany, on disbanding his army and resuming his civil duties, found himself surrounded with difficulties. Nothing indeed could be more complicated or irksome, than the va rious contending interests which he had to understand and reconcile. His engagements with France prompted him to continue the war with England ; his better judgment admonished him to remain at peace. Amid the universal corruption and selfishness which infect ed the body of the nobles, many of whom were in the pay of Eng land, he looked in vain for any one to whom he could give his con fidence, or whom he could intrust with the execution of his designs ; while the queen-mother, with whom he had hitherto acted, betrayed him, and corresponded with Dacre. 14. The impossibility of overcoming these intricate evils without a more powerful military force than he could at present bring into the field, induced the regent once more to pass into France, for the purpose of holding a conference with Francis L, on the best method of reducing the English faction. A council of regency was appointed, consisting of Huntly, Arran, Argyle, and Gonzolles, a French knight, in whom Albany placed great confidence ; and after an absence of some months, during which the war again broke out with great fury, he returned to Scotland, bringing with him a fleet of eighty-seven small vessels, in which he had embarked a body of six thousand fo reign troops. 15. With this strong reinforcement he hoped to gain a prepon i a r\\~ deratmo influence over the nobility, and to decide the con- . _\u201e\u201e test with England; but he was miserably disappointed. 1 The presence of foreign troops, always unacceptable to a people jealous of then rights, was particularly so to the Scots, who were poor, and had to support the foreigners at a great expense. This rendered the war unpopular with the great body of the na tion ; the queen-dowager was devoted to England ; and the nobles, although prepared to assemble an army for the defence of the bor ders, were opposed to any invasion of England upon a great scale, or to a war of continued aggression. As many of these barons, however, were at that moment receiving pensions from France, the payment of which any too decided demonstration might have inter rupted, they artfully concealed then repugnance. An army of forty"], [139, "A. D. 1523.] 119 JAMES V. thousand men mustered on the Boroughmoor near Edinburgh, and Albany, taking the command in person, advanced to the bor ders ; but on arriving at Melrose, the mask was dropped ; the le ad ere shewed symptoms of insubordination ; the soldiers, catching the infection, murmured against the foreign mercenaries ; and discon tent, gathering strength, at last broke out in an open refusal to ad vance. No entreaties or threats of the regent could overcome this resolution ; and after a short period, news arrived that the Earl of Surrey, having assembled an army, was advancing against them. The intelligence of his speedy approach strengthened the Scottish nobles in their determination not to risk a battle. So completely had the majority of them been corrupted by the money and intrigues of Dacre and the queen-dowager, that Albany did not venture to place them in the front, but formed his advance of the French auxi liaries and his artillery, \u2014 the only portion of the army which had acted with spirit. To have attempted to fight Surrey with these alone, would have been the extremity of rashness ; to have awaited the advance of the English earl, with an army which refused to pro ceed against the enemy, might have rendered defeat inevitable. In these critical circumstances, Albany adopted the only alternative which was safe or honourable. He disbanded the Scottish portion of his arm}- ; and he himself retreated, with his French auxiliaries and his artillery, to Eccles, from which, after a short season, he re turned to the capital, where he assembled the Parliament. 16. The proceedings of this body, as might have been anticipated, were distracted and impeded by mutual accusations and complaints. The regent could not conceal his indignation against those leaders who had so recently deserted him almost in the presence of the enemy. The nobles recriminated ; they blamed him for squander- ing the public treasure, and, notwithstanding the inclement season of the year, insisted on his dismissing the foreign troops, whose re- sidence had become burdensome. All this was calculated to disgust and mortify the governor ; and he requested permission to retire once more to France, for the purpose of holding a conference with Francis I., and inducing him to grant further assistance against the designs of England. His request was complied with, on the condi- tion that, if he did not return to Scotland within a limited period, the league with France, and his own regency, should be considered as at an end. In the mean season, the custody of the king's per- son was entrusted to the Lords Cassillis, Fleming, Borthwick, and Erskine, while the chief management of affairs was committed to a council, composed of the Chancellor, the Bishop of Aberdeen, and the Earls of Huntly and Argyle. Having made these ar rangements, the Duke of Albany quitted the kingdom, convinced,"], [140, "120 [A. D. 1524 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND I in all probability, of the impossibility of reconciling the ' various factions and interests by which it was torn in [ 1\u00b024. p;eces_ Although he gave hopes that his absence should not exceed three months, there is strong reason for believing that, when he embarked, it was with the resolution, which he fulfilled, of never returning to Scotland. 17. On the departure of Albany, it soon became apparent that a secret understanding had for some time been maintained between two of the most powerful factions in the countiy, and that his leav ing the kingdom was the signal for the breaking out of an import ant revolution. The chief actors were the Earl of Arran and the queen-mother, and there is ample evidence that their proceedings were agreeable to England. The young king was now in his thirteenth year, and his mother and Arran, having gained to their interests the peers to whom his person had been entrusted, earned him from Stirling to Edinburgh, proceeded to the palace of Holy rood, declared in a council that he had assumed the government, and issued proclamations in his name. The peers of Margaret's party then tendered their allegiance, abjured their engagements lately made with Albany, declared his regency at an end, and pro mised to maintain henceforth the authority of their sovereign. 18. It was the evident object of the queen and Arran to obtain, by this revolution, the entire command of the government. The measure was remonstrated against, in the strongest manner, by the Bishops of St Andrews and Aberdeen. They represented the utter folly of conferring the supreme power on a boy of twelve years of age, and they stated, with truth, that Albany was still the Regent ; but Margaret, supported by her brother Henry the Eighth, who hoped, through her, to govern Scotland, proved too strong for these prelates, and for a time her schemes succeeded. It was, however, only for a short season. Jealousies arose between her and Arran, who, from his near relationship to the crown, aspired to the chief power. The queen, whose love for Angus her husband, had long since turned into hatred, fixed her affections on Henry Stewart, a son of Lord Evandale, raised him to the office of treasurer, and, provided she could obtain a divorce, determined to marry him ; and Henry the Eighth, who began to find her demands too importunate, and her obedience problematical, recalled the Earl of Angus from France, with the design of making him an instrument in his pro jects for the reduction of Scotland. By his residence in that coun- try, this baron appears to have increased in experience and talent for intrigue, but not in public principle ; and his first step was to sell himself to Henry in a secret treaty, by which he engaged to support the English interests in Scotland In return, he and his"], [141, "A. D. 1524.] 121 JAMES V brother, Sir George Douglas, hoped, by Henry's aid, to place them selves at the head of the government, and to be restored to the vast estates and power which they had lost. 19. The arrival of Angus in his native country was the signal for immediate hostilities between him and the queen-mother, his wife, who had raised Henry Stewart to the office of chancellor, and de tested her husband, in proportion to the progress of her avowed and indecent attachment to this favourite. Hitherto she and her sup porters, Arran, Lennox, and the Master of Kilinaurs, had been sup ported by pensions from the English Court, and, in return, had favoured the views of Henry the Eighth ; but the principles of this venal association were of course capricious and selfish, and the ar rival of Angus, who now wielded the power of the Douglases, threatened to break it to pieces. 20. The country, indeed, presented a miserable spectacle ; a minor sovereign deserted by those who owed him allegiance and support, while his kingdom was left a prey to the rapacity of inte rested councillors, and exposed to the attacks of a powerful neigh bour, whose object was to reduce it to the condition of a dependent province. In such circumstances, it is certainly a matter of won der that it retained its liberty. 21. Three factions straggled for the pre-eminence, and tore the countiy in pieces. The first was that of Albany, the late regent, which was supported by French influence, and conducted by the Chancellor Beaton ; the second had for its leaders the Earl of Arran and the queen-regent, who held the king's person, and possessed the chief executive power ; at the head of the third were the Earl of Angus and his brother George Douglas, who were wedded to the interests of the English government. It soon became apparent that the party of the queen-mother was the weakest. Arran, a capri cious man, deserted her ; her private conduct rendered her disre putable in the eyes of the people ; and soon afterwards a coalition between Beaton the chancellor and Angus, united the whole power of Albany's party with the honse of Douglas. Margaret sunk un der this, and consented to a negotiation. She resigned the custody of her son to a council of peers nominated by parliament ; and, stripped of her power, consented to a reconciliation with Angus, her husband, in whom, along with the chancellor Beaton, the chief power in the government now centered. A feeble effort, indeed, was made by Arran to destroy the influence of the united factions ; but the armed force with which he advanced to Linlithgow was dis persed by the prompt attack of Douglas ; and the address of this politic baron soon afterwards prevailed on Arran to join his party. 22 The Earl of Angus had now gained a complete triumph over"], [142, "[A. D. 1526. 122 HISTORY' OF SCOTLAND. his enemies. He possessed the person of the young king, he was assisted by the talents and experience of the Chancellor Beaton, he had witnessed the gradual decay of the faction of Albany and the French monarch, and he had been joined by Arran, who, although personally a weak man, from his high birth and great estates pos sessed much power. His first step was wise and temperate. A pacification for three years was concluded with England ; and it was hoped that this might be followed by a marriage between the young king and Hemy's daughter, the princess Maiy, a measure which, if guarded so as to preserve the independence of Scotland, might have been attended with the happiest results. 23. The country, so long distracted by border war and internal anarchy, might now, under a judicious administration, have looked forward to something like tranquillity. Had Angus been reconciled to the queen, his wife ; had he been contented with his recovery of greater power than he had lost, and been willing to administer the government with justice and moderation ; there was every reason to hope for the maintenance of peace, security, and good order. The French party in Scotland had completely sunk. Dr Magnus, Henry's English minister, who, during his residence in Scotland, had been an object of great jealousy to the people, was recalled ; and Lord Dacre, whose money and intrigues for so many years had corrupted the Scottish nobles, and introduced disunion and treachery into all then councils, was removed by death from the scene of his mis chievous activity. AU these things were favourable ; and the well affected, who sighed for the blessings of peace and good government, anticipated a period of repose. 24. It was a vain expectation, destroyed by the precipitate folly of the queen-mother, and the grasping ambition of Angus. That powerful baron had hitherto aimed at one great object, which he now deemed himself on the very point of attaining ; to accomplish H reconciliation with his wife, the queen-mother, and, possessing her estates, with the custody of the young king's person, to engross the whole power of the government. At this crisis, Margaret, so far from becoming less hostile to Angus, gave herself up more in considerately than before to her passion for Henry Stewart, and, procuring a divorce from a husband whom she hated, espoused her paramour with a precipitation which disgusted the people. 25. Tins imprudent step determined Angus to change his ground, I a pj and a dread of some counter-revolution threw him upon i pens. llew and more violent courses. By a successful stroke of ! 1 policy, he procured the passing of an act of Parliament which annulled the authority of the secret council, the only power which stood between him and absolute dominion. At the same"], [143, "A. D. 1526.] 123 JAMES V. time, the parliament declared that the minority of the young king was at an end ; and that, having completed his fourteenth year, he was to be considered as an independent sovereign. While the youthful monarch thus nominally assumed the government, that provision which entrusted the keeping of the royal person to certain peers in rotation, remained in force ; and as Angus had artfully summoned the parliament to meet Mm at that precise time, when it belonged to himself and the Archbishop of Glasgow to assume their periodical guardianship of the king, the consequence of this state man\u0153uvre was to place the whole power of the government in then- hands. 26. A new secret council was nominated, composed solely of the creatures of Angus ; the great seal was soon after taken from Bea ton, and the young king was watched with the utmost jealousy, and compelled to give his consent to eveiy thing proposed to him by his new masters. An act of parliament was passed, granting a remis sion to the heads and followers of this all-powerful faction for the crimes, robberies, or treasons committed by them during the last nineteen years ; every office of trust or emolument in the kingdom was disposed of to one or another of its supporters ; and the au cient tyranny of the house of Douglas once more attained a degree of strength which rivalled or rather usurped the royal power. At this unhappy period, the borders became the scene of tumult and confusion, and the insolence of the numerous vassals of this great family was intolerable ; murders, spoliations, and crimes of varied enormity, were committed with impunity. The arm of the law, pa ralyzed by the power of an unprincipled faction, failed to arrest the guilty ; the sources of justice were corrupted ; the highest and most sacred ecclesiastical dignities became the prey of daring intruders, or were sold to the highest bidder ; and the young king, carried about through the country by Angus, apparently in great state, but merely a puppet in the hand of Iris masters, sighed in vain over a captivity to which there appeared no prospect of a termination. An attempt indeed was made for his deliverance, first by the Laird of Buccleugh, one of the most powerful of the border barons, and af terwards by the Earl of Lennox, who deserted the party of the Douglases, and to whom the young monarch was much attached. But Buccleugh was routed with considerable loss, and Lennox de feated and slain. 27. These unsuccessful attempts only strengthened the power of Angus. He entered into a more strict alliance with Henry \"VTH., obtained the friendship and support of Beaton, the Archbishop of St Andrews, and, unchecked by any opposition, ruled all things at his will. Nothing, indeed, could be more miserable than the pic-"], [144, "124 [A.D. 1526. HISTORY' OF SCOTLAND. ture presented by the country ; a monarch in captivity, a nobility in thraldom, and a people groaning under the most complicated op pressions, yet with their hands tied, and compelled by the miserable system under which they lived to serve their oppressors. It may be asked, what was the secret history of this enormous power, this degraded and implicit obedience? The answer is to be found in the fact, that the Douglases were masters of the royal person ; they could compel the king to affix his signature to any deeds or letters which then tyranny or their caprice might dictate. Angus, the supreme lord of all this misrule, was chancellor, and the great seal at his command ; his uncle, Douglas of Kilspindy, was treasurer, and commanded the whole revenues of the countiy ; the law, with all its terrible feudal processes of treason and forfeiture, could be wielded by them at pleasure. So long as the king remained in their hands, this powerful machinery was all theirs ; the moment he escaped, the system broke to pieces, and their power was at an end. 28. Of all this James, who had now entered his seventeenth year, was perfectly aware ; and as every horn- of his captivity made the Douglases more hateful to him, his mind became intently occu pied with projects for his escape. Nor was it long ere he effected it. With an address superior to his years, the king had either succeeded in lulling the suspicions of his keepers, or a continuance of unchecked power had made them careless. James was at Falk land. Angus, Douglas his brother, and Archibald his uncle, were absent on their private affairs ; only Douglas of Pathhead, the cap tain of the royal guard, remained. The young monarch called for the park-keeper, and, as had been his wont, proposed to hunt next morning. Therefore, says a graphic old chronicler, he \" caused him to warn all the whole tenants and gentlemen thereabouts who had the speediest dogs, that they would come to Falkland wood on the morn, to meet him at seven hours, for he was determined he would slay a fat buck or two for his pleasure ; and to that effect caused warn the cooks and stewards to make his supper ready, that he might go to his bed the sooner, and have his dejeune (break fast) ready by four o'clock, and commanded James Douglas of Pathhead to pass the sooner to his bed, and caused bring his colla tion, and drank to James Douglas, saying to him, that he should have good hunting on the morrow, bidding him be early astir. Then the king went to his bed ; and James Douglas, seeing the king in his bed, wist that all things had been sure enough, and passed in like manner to his bed. When the watch was set,\" con tinues the historian, \" and all things in quietness, the king called on a yeoman of the stable, and desired him bring one of his suits of apparel, hose, cloak, coat, and bonnet, and putting them on,"], [145, "A. D. 1528.] JAMES V. 125 stept forth as a yeoman of the stable, and was unperceived of the watches, till he had passed to the stables, and caused saddle a horse for himself, and one led, and took two servants with him, namely, Jocky Hart, a yeoman of the stable, and another secret chamber boy, and leapt on horse, and spurred hastily his journey to Stir ling, and won there by the breaking of the day, over the bridge, which he caused to be closed behind him, that none without licence might win that passage. After this he passed to the castle, and was received there by the captain, who was very glad of his com ing, and prepared the castle with all things needful. Then he caused shut the gates, and let down the portcullis, and put the king in his bed to sleep, because he had ridden all that night.\" 29. Having thus regained his liberty, James's first act was to . p. | summon a council, and issue a proclamation, interdicting -~,\" Angus and the Douglases from all approach within six miles J of the court, under pain of treason. Nor did they venture to disobey it. On discovering the flight of the king, Angus, Ar chibald, and Sir George, had hastily assembled a few followers, thrown themselves on horseback, and were riding to Stirling, when they were met by the herald, who read the act, and commanded them in the king's name to halt. For a moment they hesitated, but it was only for a moment. Then sovereign was free ; the weapons which but a day before they had wielded with such irre sistible force, were now ready to be employed against themselves A single step forward, and they were guilty of treason, their pro perty and their Lives at the mercy of the crown. All this rose rapidly and fearfully before them ; and aware how vain it would be at such a moment to meet the power of their enemies, they re treated to Linlithgow."], [146, "126 CHAPTER Xm. A.

James V., whc now took the government into his own hands, -r-rr-| had not completed his seventeenth year ; but he had been \\ I nursed in the school of difficulty, and his character had 1528- I acquired a consistency and vigour far superior to his age. This was the more to his credit, because the Douglases had ne glected his education ; and while they gave him no opportunities of cultivating the qualities which might have made him a blessing to his people, permitted him to indulge in that love of pleasure and tendency to dissipation which were incident to his temperament and time of life. Happily his character, although it did not escape the pollution of such a base system, survived it ; and, with some great faults, the king possessed at the same time not a few of the high est qualities which became a wise and good prince. Strict and scrupulously just, unwearied in his application to business, earnest in his endeavours to remove the complicated burdens which, under the tyranny of the late oligarchy, had oppressed the people, gene rous though somewhat warm in his temper, easy of access, a stran ger to pride, and fond, almost to a fault, of mingling familiarly with all classes of his subjects, he soon rendered himself, young as he was, an object of respect to his nobles, and of affection to his people. 2. The principles which regulated his future government sprung naturally from the circumstances of his early life. The sternest resentment against Angus and the house of Douglas was combined with a determination to assert and regain the rights of the crown, and to abridge the power of an aristocracy, which had grown in tolerable during a long minority. Towards his uncle, Henry VIII ."], [147, "A. D. 1528.] JAMES V. 127 it was impossible that his feelings could be any other than those of resentment and suspicion. It was by this prince that there had been introduced into Scotland an organized system of corruption, of which his able and unscrupulous minister, Lord Dacre, had been the author. Many Scottish nobles had become the pensioned agents of the English government ; paid informers swarmed in the court and through the country. All idea of conquering Scotland by force of arms had been long since abandoned ; but a more insidious ex pedient was adopted, by which the English king, maintaining the Douglases in their usurped dominion, received in return their ho mage and fidelity, and administered the government at his plea sure. 3. James's great objects, which we can trace through the whole remaining period of his reign, were to put an end to this system of foreign dictation ; to restore its ancient and constitutional preroga tives to the crown ; to bridle the exorbitant power of the great nobles, raising up as a check upon them the large and influential body of the clergy; to encourage the mercantile and commercial classes of his people ; and to facilitate the administration of the laws, and ensure impartial justice to the lowest orders of the community. 3. For the accomplishment of such ends, it was first necessary to exhibit a wholesome example of retributive justice upon those who had been the greatest delinquents. It was declared treason for any person to hold intercourse with Angus, and every Douglas was commanded to leave the capital on pain of death. Angus him self was commanded to remain beyond the Spey, and required to deliver his brother Sir George Douglas, and his uncle Archibald, as hostages for his answering to a summons for treason. Having haughtily disobeyed these orders, a parliament was assembled, by which he was proclaimed a traitor, and his lands nominally di vided among those nobles to whom James owed his late success. It was easier, however, to promulgate than to execute such decrees against so powerful a baron ; nor was it till after repeated attacks upon Tantallon Castle, some of them led by the king in person, that the arch-offender was reduced, and compelled to seek an asylum in England. 5. James next directed his attention to the state of the borders ; and in an expedition which was long remembered for the vigour, dispatch, and severity of the royal vengeance, inflicted punishment upon the greatest offenders, among whom was the noted freebooter, Johnnie Armstrong, and reduced the district to a state of tranquil lity. Scarcely was this accomplished, when the Orkneys were threatened to be torn from the crown by the rebellion of the Earl of Caithness ; and the Isles became the scene of a fierce struggle"], [148, "128 [A. D. 1532, HISTORY' OF SCOTLAND. between the Earl of Argyle and Alexander of Isla, one of the most powerful chiefs of that remote region. The judgment and energy of the monarch were shewn in the speedy re-establishment of peace in both quarters ; and the people, aware that the sceptre was once more in a firm hand, readily and gratefully co-operated with then sovereign in alt his labours. 6. England and France were now at peace, and Henry \"VTIL i and Francis I. united in a strict alliance, which had for l v^q its 0,DJect t0 bridle the increasing power of the Emperor t0 ' Charles V. Under these circumstances, Henry proposed a 1530, matrimonial alliance with Scotland, and the design was encouraged by France ; while the Emperor, jealous of the power which so near a connexion with James might give to his enemies, offered in marriage to the young prince his sister, the Queen of Hungary, or his niece, the daughter of Christiera, King of Denmark, with Norway as her dowry. 7. For the present, however, all these offers were declined, and the monarch appeared wholly engrossed with the prosecution of his various plans for the melioration of his kingdom. Finding himself thwarted by the nobles, he was compelled to adopt decided mea sures, and to promote the clergy to those offices which had been filled by temporal barons. Argyle was thrown into prison, and the Earl of Crawford stripped of a large part of his estates ; the deter mination that no Douglas should ever bear sway in Scotland, be came a more stern and obstinate principle than before ; and while the Archbishop of Glasgow, the Abbot of Holyrood, and the Bishop of Dunkeld, were principally consulted in affairs of state, many of the nobles who had hitherto enjoyed the royal confidence, saw them selves treated with coldness and distrust. 8. It was at this time that the king carried into effect two im- . Yt portant measures, the one affecting the commercial inte- 1 ' 9 ' rests of his kingdom, the other of still higher moment, as 1 an endeavour to secure to all classes of his subjects an equal and speedy administration of justice. A commercial treaty between Scotland and the Netherlands had been concluded by James I., for the period of 100 years. It was now approaching its termination, and an embassy was dispatched to Brussels, which re newed the league for another century. His second measure was the institution of the College of Justice, a court consisting of four teen judges, one-half selected from the spiritual, the other from the temporal estate, of which the idea is commonly believed to have been suggested by the parliament of Paris. The principal design of this new judicature was to put an end to the delay and partiality arising out of the baronial courts ; in other words, to remove the"], [149, "A. D. 1532.] JAMES V. 129 means of oppression from the hands of the aristocracy. But as it was provided, that the king might at his pleasure send three or four members of his council to give their votes, it was evident that the subject was freed from one grievance, only to be exposed to the hazard of another, whenever his rights might happen to come into collision with the crown. 9. During these transactions, the Douglases and their adherents were driven upon violent and discreditable courses, in proportion as their prospect of reconciliation to the king became more hopeless and remote. The Earl of Bothwell, also a powerful border baron, whose excesses James had severely punished, entered into a trai torous alliance with Henry VHL, in which he engaged, if properly supported, to dethrone his sovereign, and to \" crown the English king in the town of Edinburgh within a brief time ;\" while the Earl of Angus did not hesitate, in the extremity of his resentment, to sell himself to England ; and, in a written agreement which yet re mains, engaged to \" make unto Henry the oath of allegiance, to re cognise him as supreme lord of Scotland, as his prince and sove reign.\" 10. In consequence of these base engagements, war was once more kindled on the borders, and carried on by the Douglases and the English with such desolating fury, that James was compelled to call out the whole body of the fighting men in the country. These he divided into four armies, to each of which in rotation the defence of the marches was entrusted. This measure effectually checked the power of the enemy, and there was little prospect of Bothwell fulfilling his threat of crowning Henry in the capital ; bnt peace seemed more distant than ever, and nothing could be more deplo rable than the picture presented by the countiy. The flames of villages and granges, the destruction of the fruits and the cessation of the labour of the husbandman, the stoppage put to the enter prise of the merchant, the increase among the people of the spirit of national antipathy, the corruption of the nobles by the money of England, the extinction of all affection for the sovereign among such pensioned adventurers, and the decay of the healthy feelings of national independence ; all these lamentable consequences sprang out of the continuance of the war, and made the king desirous of seeming peace, even if it should be at some sacrifice. 11. This he at length accomplished. James agreed that the Douglases, by whom was meant Angus, his brother George, and his uncle Archibald, should remain unmolested in England, supported by Henry as his subjects, on condition that Edrington Castle, the only spot which they held in Scotland, should be surrendered, and reparation made for any expedition which they or the English king"], [150, "130 HISTORY* OF SCOTLAND. [A. D. 1532. might hereafter conduct against Scotland. On these conditions, a pacification was concluded for the period of the lives of Henry and James, and a year after the death of him who first deceased ; and soon after its ratification, the young monarch, whose firmness and talent in the management of his government made him an object of respect to the European princes, received the orders of the Garter from England, of St Michael from France, and of the Golden Fleece from the emperor. 12. James was now in his twenty-second year, and his marriage was earnestly desired by the country ; but he had hitherto shown little inclination to gratify the wishes of his people. With all his good qualities, he unhappily inherited from his father an extreme devotedness to pleasure, which had been rather encouraged than restrained by the Douglases ; and his passions getting the better of his prudence and principle, sought then gratification in low intrigues, carried on in disguise, and in pursuit of which he not unfrequently exposed his life to the attacks and revenge of his rivals. It was now full time that he should renounce these disreputable excesses ; and having evaded an offer made by the Spanish ambassador, of the hand of the princess Mary of Portugal, and declined a similar proposal by Henry Vin., of his daughter the princess Maiy, he dispatched an embassy to France, for the purpose of concluding a matrimonial alliance with that crown. 13. In the mean time, the principles of the Reformation had been silently making progress among the people of Scotland ; and from this period they exercised a marked and increasing influence over the government of the country. It was now nearly six years since Patrick Hamilton, Abbot of Feme, the friend and disciple of Luther and Melancthon, having renounced the errors of the Roman Catho lic church, and embraced the doctrines of the Reformers, had been accused of heresy, and condemned to the flames. The cruel sen tence was carried into effect at St Andrews in 1528, dining the minority of James, and while the supreme power was in the hands of the Earl of Angus. On taking the government into his own hand, James, although decidedly inimical to the principles of Angus in all other things, unhappily followed his determination to perse cute those whom he esteemed the enemies of the truth. David Straiton and Norman Gouriay, who were disciples of the Reforma tion, were tried for heresy, condemned and brought to the stake, on the 27th of August 1534 ; and the intolerant and cruel conduct of the king compelled some who had embraced the same opinions to flee for safety to England. 14. About this period, Henry \"VTIL exerted himself to the ut most to prevail upon the Scottish king to imitate his own conduct,"], [151, "A.. D. 1536.] JAMES V. 131 and shake off the yoke of Rome. He endeavoured to open his eyes to the tyranny of the Pope's usurpations, sent to him the treatise entitled the \" Doctrine of a Christian Man,\" and dispatched Dr Barlow and Lord William Howard to request a conference with his royal nephew at York ; but the remembrance of the injuries he had sustained, resentment for Henry's intrigues with his discontented subjects, and an attachment to the faith of his fathers, indisposed James to listen to these overtures ; and when Paul HI. deputed his legate Campeggio to visit Scotland, the embassy found it no diffi cult matter to confirm the Scottish monarch in his attachment to the Catholic church. At the same time, he addressed him by the title of which Henry had proved himself unworthy, Defender of the Faith, and presented to him a cap and a sword which had been con secrated by the Pope at the Feast of the Nativity. 15. A parliament which assembled about this time, made two . p. provisions which deserve attention. The importation of ' \u00b0 the works of Luther, which had been prohibited by a for- 1 mer act, was again strictly forbidden ; any discussion of his opinions, unless for the purpose of proving their falsehood, was interdicted ; and all persons who possessed any treatises of the re former, were enjoined, under the penalty of confiscation and impri sonment, to deliver them up within forty days. The second act, which is well worthy of notice, related to the boroughs, in this dark age the best nurseries of industry and freedom. Hitherto feudal barons had been elected to the offices of magistrates and superin tendents over the privileges of these corporations ; an unwise prac tice, by which the provosts, aldermen, or bailies, instead of being industrious citizens, interested in the protection of trade, and the security of property, were little else than idle and factious tyrants, who consumed the substance and invaded the corporate privileges of the burgesses. A law was now made, that no person should be elect ed to fill any office in the magistracy of a borough, but such as was himself an honest and substantial burgess ; and, although not imme diately or strictly carried into effect, the enactment evinced the dawning of a better spirit. 16. War still continued between Francis I. and the emperor, a ' . \u201e circumstance which induced the French king to continue \u25a0 ' an amicable correspondence with England ; and being I l0'jt'' aware that Henry VIII. was intent upon accomplishing a marriage with Scotland, Francis was unwilling to disgust this pas sionate monarch by any very speedy attention to James's desires to unite himself to a French princess. To accomplish his purpose, the Scottish king took a voyage to France, and, landing at Dieppe, proceeded thence in disguise to the palace of the Duke of Vendome."], [152, "[A. D. 1536. 132 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Here, being received only as a noble stranger, he saw, for the first time, but did not approve of his affianced bride, Marie de Bourbon, the duke's daughter, and transferred his affections to Madeleine, the youngest daughter of the French king, to whom he was soon after married in the church of Notre Dame. In the circumstances in which Scotland was then placed, the Church of Rome was in clined to consider this union as one of great importance ; and it has been noted, that seven cardinals surrounded the altar. Nor were these anticipations disappointed. James remained for nine months in France ; and, when he returned to his own kingdom, it was soon evident that some great changes were on the eve of taking place. 17. Francis I., although still nominally at peace with Henry, had become alienated from him by the violent and dictatorial tone which he assumed. The pope, who considered his own existence as involved in the contest with England, had neglected no method by which he might first terminate the disputes between the emperor and the French king, and then unite them in a coalition against Henry, as the common enemy. We have already noticed the suc cess of the court of Rome, in flattering the vanity of James ; and it appears that, in 1537, these intrigues were so far successful, that a pacification was concluded between Francis and the emperor. From this moment, the cordiality between France and England was com pletely at an end, while every argument which could have weight on a young and ardent mind was- addressed to James, to induce him to join the projected league against Henry. 18. Nor had the conduct of Henry, during James's absence in France, been calculated to allay those resentful feelings which al ready existed between them. He had sent into Scotland Sir Ralph Sadler, a crafty and able diplomatist, for the express purpose of completing the system of secret intelligence introduced, as we have seen, with pernicious success by Lord Dacre. This minister was instructed to gain an influence over the nobility, to attach the queen-mother to his interest, and to sound the inclinations of the body of the people on the subject of peace or war, and on the adop tion of the reformed opinions or adherence to the ancient faith. The Douglases were still maintained with high favour in England. Their power, although nominally extinct, was far from being de stroyed ; then spies penetrated into every quarter, and had even followed the young king to France, whence they gave information of his most private motions. Finally, those feudal covenants, term ed bonds of manrent, still bound to their interest many of the most potent of the nobles whom the vigour of the king's government had disgusted or estranged. 19. From this description, we may gather the state of parties at"], [153, "A. D. 1537.] 133 JAMES V. the return of James to his dominions after his marriages. On the one hand was seen Henry VHL, the head of the Protestant refor mation in England, supported in Scotland not only by the still for midable power and unceasing intrigues of the Douglases, but by a large proportion of the nobles, and the talents of his sister, the queen-mother. On the other hand stood the king of Scotland, as sisted by the united talent, zeal, and wealth of the Roman Catholic clergy, the loyalty of some of the most potent peers, the co-opera tion of France, the approval of the emperor, the affection of the great body of his people, upon whose minds the doctrines of Luther had not yet made any very general impression, and the cordial sup port of the papal court. The course of events, into which we can not enter minutely, but the principal consequences of which we shall point out, illustrated strikingly these opposing interests. 20. Meanwhile, scarcely had the rejoicings ceased for James's re turn to his dominions with his youthful queen, when it was appa rent that she was sinking under a consumption, which, in a short time, carried her to the grave. .Although depressed by this cala mity, the king did not permit it to divert his mind from that system of policy on which he had resolved to act ; and an embassy to . p. France was entrusted to David Beaton, afterwards the ' ' celebrated cardinal, who requested for his master the hand of Mary of Guise, the widow of the Duke of Longueville, and sister to the Cardinal of Lorraine. To this second union the court of France joyfully assented ; and the marriage took place at St Andrews, within a year after the death of the former queen. At this period the life of the king was twice endangered by conspi racy ; and although much obscurity hangs over the subject, botli plots were probably connected with the intrigues of the house of Douglas. At the head of the first was the master of Forbes, a brother-in-law of Angus. The chief actor in the second was the Lady Glammis, his sister, who, only two days after the execution of Forbes, was accused of an attempt to poison her sovereign, found guilty, and condemned to be burned ; a dreadful sentence, the exe cution of which she bore with the hereditary courage of her house. 21. An event now happened, which drew after it important con sequences. James Beaton, Archbishop of St Andrews, died, and was succeeded in the primacy by his nephew, Cardinal Beaton, a man far superior to his uncle in talent, and still more devotedly at tached to the interests of the Roman Catholic church. It was to him, as we have seen, that James had committed the negotiation for his second marriage ; and so great appears to have been the in fluence which he acquired over the royal mind, that the king hence forth selected him as his principal adviser."], [154, "[A. D. 1540. 134 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 22. Beaton's accession to additional power was marked by a re- . newed persecution of the reformers ; and it is worthy of observation, that most of the converts to the reformed faith 1539- belonged to the order of the inferior clergy. Keillor, For ret, Simson, and Beveridge, were arraigned before an ecclesiastica1 tribunal, and soon afterwards Kennedy and Russell ; out of which number, three, Kennedy, Forret, and Russell, suffered at the stake with great meekness and courage. There can be little doubt that such inhuman executions operated in favour of, rather than against, the progress of the Reformation. 23. The coalition between Francis the First and the emperor was now completed, under the auspipes of the papal court ; and Henry the Eighth, aware of the great efforts made to induce James to join the league against him, again dispatched Sir Ralph Sadler into Scotland. The object of this able negotiator was to rouse James's jealousy against the increasing power of the clergy, to prevail upon him to throw off his allegiance to the pope, to imitate Henry's example, by suppressing the monasteries, and to urge him to main tain the peace with England. To the last request the Scottish king replied, that, if Henry's conduct was pacific, nothing should induce him to join any hostile league against him : but he assured Sadler that he had found his clergy to be his most loyal and useful subjects ; and although he would be anxious to see a reformation in the general morals of this body, he did not see how that could be effected by renouncing the authority of his holy father the pope, the terrestrial head of the church, and thus setting an example of rebellion and confusion. 24. James had for some time meditated an important enterprise, I . -p. which he now executed ; a voyage to the most northern parts | ' \" of his dominions, conducted by himself, and on a scale such j '_ as had not been attempted by any of his predecessors. His fleet consisted of twelve ships, fully armed and provisioned. He was attended by Beaton, and the Earls of Huntly and Arran ; and these barons, bringing with them their armed vassals, formed a force which, united to the royal suite and attendants, was equal to a little army. Lindsay, a skilful hydrographer, accompanied the expedition ; and his maps and charts, the first rude essays in this science ever at tempted in Scotland, are preserved at the present day. The king first coasted Fife, Angus, and Buchan ; he next visited Caithness, crossed the Pentland Frith to the Orkneys, doubled Cape Wrath, steered for Lewis, crossed over to Skye, circumnavigated Mull, swept along the shores of Argyle, and passing Kentire, inspected Arran and Bute, whence he sailed up the Clyde to Dumbarton, where he concluded his voyage."], [155, "A. D. 1540.] JAMES V. 135 25. The effects of this royal progress were salutary and decisive. The force with which James was accompanied secured a prompt submission to his commands, and inspired these remote districts with a wholesome dread of the royal name. Some of the fiercer and more independent chiefs, who affected a show of resistance, were seized and confined in irons on board the fleet ; others, more gently treated, were yet compelled to accompany the monarch as hostages for the pacific behaviour of their followers ; and all were convinced that any attempt to brave the power of the crown must, for the present, be vain and ruinous. 26. This exhibition of increasing energy in the king, only ex posed him the more to the jealousy of those nobles whose power had been nourished by long intervals of licence, and who now clearly perceived, that unless they were prepared to resign their rights, a struggle between them and then- sovereign could hardly be averted. A proof of this was shewn on James's return to court from his northern voyage, when a conspiracy against his life was detected, the third which had occurred within no very long period. Like the rest, it is involved in obscurity ; but the proof was considered suffi cient, and its author, Sir James Hamilton, commonly called the Bastard of Arran, was tried, convicted, and executed. It is said that the king was thrown into a state of great despondency and gloom by the discovery of this plot ; that it opened his eyes to the manifold dangers which surrounded a prince at variance with his nobles ; and that he began to feel that he was engaged in a contest in which they might prove too strong for him. 27. Whatever credit we may attach to these reports, the conduct of James gave decided proofs that he was determined to continue the struggle ; and in a parliament which soon afterwards assembled in the capital, he strengthened his own hands by annexing to the crown the whole of the Hebrides, by which we are to understand the isles north and south of the two Kentires. But this was not all. To these new acquisitions were added the Orkney and Zetland Isles, many extensive lordships, Jedburgh forest, and the demesnes of Angus, Glammis, Liddesdale, and Evandale. 28. In the want of contemporary evidence, it is difficult to decide upon the strict justice of this sweeping measure. It is possible that, by rigidly investigating the history of former rebellions and present treasons, James may have persuaded himself that he was entitled to the forfeiture of all these large estates and principalities ; but in such circumstances it had been the practice of former monarchs to parcel out the forfeited lands among the nobles who had preserved their loyalty ; and in the measure now adopted, of annexing the whole to the crown, the aristocracy saw little else than their own"], [156, "I\" A. D. 1540. 136 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. intended rain. It was in vain that the measure was followed by the publication of a general act of amnesty for all former tre'sisons. The Earl of Angus, Sir George Douglas, and the whole of their adherents, were excepted ; and men observed that, while the king's generosity was vague and capricious, his aversion to those who had once injured him was stern and immutable. 29. It is not easy to discover James's exact opinions regarding the progress of the reformed doctrines, which now began to create great alarm in the Roman Catholic clergy. On the one hand, he seems to have become convinced of the necessity for a reform in the church, and to have looked with a severe eye upon the idleness, corruption, and ignorance of a large portion of the clergy. He en couraged Sir David Lindsay, whose satire upon the three estates contained a bitter attack upon the prelates ; and, being himself much involved in debt, there is reason to believe he regarded the overgrown possessions and extraordinary wealth of the clergy with certain longings to appropriate some portion of them towards the exigencies of the state. Yet, in the parliament to which we have just alluded, it was made a capital offence to argue against the su preme authority or the spiritual infallibility of the pope ; the discus sion of religious questions in private meetings was interdicted ; a law was passed against the demolition of the shrines and images of saints ; and it was evidently the opinion of the king, that the refor mation should be made by the church itself, within itself, and under the sanction of its head the pope. 30. Such seem to have been the feelings and the policy of the sovereign. Those of another influential body in the state, the clergy, are easily detected. To counteract the intrigues of Henry the Eighth, and to check any incipient feelings of favour towards the reformation, the great reliance of Cardinal Beaton and the Ro man Catholic party was in the prospect of a war with England. To accomplish this, they had unfortunately ample materials to work upon. Henry the Eighth was violent and dictatorial ; James proud, and jealous of his independence. The English king had espoused the interests of the banished house of Douglas, and fomented dis content among the rest of the Scottish nobles. James was animat ed by an unrelenting animosity to the Earl of Angus, the head of the house of Douglas, and tc all who bore the name. Henry, in stigated by the utmost hostility to the Roman see, eagerly desired that his royal nephew should imitate his example, suppress the re ligious houses, and proclaim his independence ; but his instructions to his ambassador Sadler, upon this subject, contained expressions so personally insolent to James, that, if obeyed, his mission must have occasioned disgust rather than conciliation. The English king"], [157, "A. D. 1542.] JAMES V. 137 requested a personal interview at York ; and James, after a pro mise to meet him, broke the appointment with Henry, who had proceeded to that city in expectation of his arrival. 31. At tins crisis, the Scottish king evidently dreaded being pre maturely hurried into war. He was in debt ; he suspected the fide lity of his nobles ; he was well aware that a feudal monarch at va riance with his barons, the sinews of his strength, was likely to be dishonoured and defeated. He had lately lost his only children, Arthur and James ; and he believed that Beaton's anxiety for war was dictated by selfish motives, and influenced by his intrigues with Rome. Under these circumstances, public policy and personal feel ing alike made him dread any immediate hostilities with England, aud he endeavoured by an embassy to avert the rapture ; but Henry, from the moment of his disappointment at York, would listen to no message of conciliation. War was resolved on, the east and middle marches were put into a state of defence, Berwick inspected, mus ters raised in the north, and soon afterwards Sir James Bowes, with the force of the east marches, crossed the border. The banish ed Angus, his brother Sir George Douglas, and a large body of the retainers of the Douglases, had joined him ; but they were encoun tered and completely defeated by Huntly and Home. 32. This, however, was merely a preliminary outbreak ; and, as such border outrages had frequently occurred without drawing after them more serious consequences, James made a last effort to avert the storm, by sending commissioners first to York, and afterwards to meet the Duke of Norfolk, who, at the head of an army of forty thousand men, had crossed the Tweed, and already given many of the granges and villages to the flames. But it was now vain to attempt negotiation ; and aware that the crisis had arrived, the Scottish king commanded Huntly and Home, upon whose fidelity he had most reliance, to watch the progress of Norfolk, while he himself assembled the main force of his kingdom on the Borough moor near Edinburgh. 33. With this army, which mustered thirty thousand strong, j . p. James advanced to Fala-moor, and, when encamped there, I ' ' received the welcome intelligence that Norfolk, compelled I ' by the want of supplies and the severity of the winter, was in full retreat. It was now the time to retaliate, and James issued orders for an immediate invasion of England. But the nobles felt their own strength. They had long regarded the measures of the court with distrust, some even with indignation and a desire of re venge ; they recalled to mind the proceedings of the monarch, and the threatening attitude lately assumed by the crown towards the whole body of the aristocracy ; and, when commanded to cross the F 2"], [158, "[A. D. 1542. 138 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. borders, they haughtily and all but unanimously refused. It was in vain that James, stung with such an indignity, threatened, remon strated, and even entreated them, as they valued then own honour and his, to proceed against the English. The feelings of attachment to their prince, and of revenge against the enemy, seemed to be completely extinguished in a resolution to assert their power and procure a redress of then grievances ; and the sovereign was at last compelled to disband the army, and return outbraved and defeated to his capital. 34. There can be no doubt that so mortifying a reverse sunk deep into the heart of James ; but his pride, and the natural vigour of his character, supported him. Though deserted by the majority, he had still some powerful friends among the nobles, and the clergy were unanimously in his favour ; and it was resolved to make a second effort to reassemble the army for the invasion of England. Its success, though partial, once more gave a gleam of hope to the monarch. A force of ten thousand men was collected, chiefly by the exertions of Lord Maxwell, with which it was resolved to break across the western marches ; and the king took his station at Caer laverock, where he eagerly waited the result of the expedition. A distrust of his nobles, however, still haunted him ; and secret orders were issued, that, as soon as the army reached the river Esk, his favourite, Oliver Sinclair, shoidd be entrusted with the chief com mand. Nothing could be more unwise than this resolution. It was received with murmurs of discontent ; and when the new ge neral exhibited himself to the camp, and a herald attempted to read the royal commission by which he was appointed, the whole army became agitated, disorderly, and almost mutinous. At this crisis, Dacre and Musgrave, two English officers, advanced to reconnoitre, at the head of three hundred horse, and, approaching near enough to perceive the condition of the Scots, boldly charged them. The effect of this surprise was instantaneous and fatal. Ten thousand Scots fled from three hundred English cavalry, with scarcely a mo mentary resistance. In the panic, the greater number escaped, but a thousand prisoners were taken, and among them many of the leading nobles, Cassillis, Glencairn, Maxwell, Somerville, Gray, Oliphant, and Fleming. 35. This second calamity completely overwhelmed the king. He had eagerly awaited at Caerlaverock the first news from the army, and he anticipated a victory which should efface the late dishonour, and restore the feelings of cordiality between himself and his barons. In an instant the hope was blasted, and gave place to the most gloomy despondency. For their disgraceful conduct James could tind no solution but in the persuasion that his nobles had secretly"], [159, "MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS. Biirn a.d. 1542. Reheaded 15S7."], [160, ""], [161, "A. D. 1542.] MARY'. 139 conspired to betray him to England, and to sacrifice the indepen dence of the kingdom to the gratification of then personal revenge. This idea preyed upon his mind. The feeling that his army had exposed themselves, their sovereign, and the Scottish name to con tempt, took entire possession of him. He became the victim of a low fever, having its seat in a wounded heart, and sunk into a state of silent melancholy. When in this hopeless condition, the news arrived that his queen had given birth to a daughter. He had al ready lost his two sons, and clung to the hope that his next child might be a boy. But here, too, he was met by disappointment ; and wandering back in thought to the time when the daughter of Bruce brought to his ancestor, the Steward of Scotland, the dowry of the kingdom, he received the intelligence with the melancholy remark, \u2014 \" It cam wi' a lass, it will gang wi' a lass\" \u2014 (\" It came by a girl, it will go with a girl.\") While he said this, a few of the most faithful of his nobles and councillors stood round his bed ; and as they strove to comfort him, he stretched out his hand for them to kiss, and regarding them with a look of great affection, closed his eyes, and placidly expired. He died in the thirty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-ninth of his reign. CHAPTER XIV. A. D. 1542 to 1550. Mary. CHRONOLOGY OF THE PERIOD. A. D. 1547- Edward VI., King of England. Henry II., King of France. A. P. 1545. Beginning of the Council of Trent, which continued eighteen years. 1. Somewhat more than two centuries and a half had elapsed, since the death of Alexander the Third had left the countiy under circumstances of calamity and danger strikingly similar to those in which it now found itself on losing James V. Alexander had been bereft of all his sons, and the crown descended to an only grand daughter, the Maiden of Norway. James had been visited by a like bereavement. His sons, Arthur and James, had been cut off, and his only daughter, Mary, an infant eight days old, was now queen. On the death of Alexander, the kingdom saw itself ex-"], [162, "[A. D. 1542. 140 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. posed to the ambitious designs of Edward L, who immediately con ceived the project of marrying the queen of Scotland to his eldest son. On the death of James, Henry VIIL, a monarch far inferior in talent to Edward, but equally ambitious, and, where the rights of others were concerned, still more unscrupulous, at once formed the design of marrying his son the Prince of Wales to the infant Mary. Edward, when disappointed of his first object by the death of the infant queen, resorted to intrigue and force to accomplish his purpose ; and Henry having been baffled in his ambition, not in deed by the death of Mary, but by her betrothment to the Dauphin, resorted to the same weapons to effect his designs. One point of the parallel, and that the most mortifying of all, remains. In the days of Edward, Scotland was basely deserted by her leading no bility, and owed her liberty to the inherent love of freedom and the persevering spirit of her people. It was the same under Henry VIII. and Edward VI. The lapse of two centuries and a half found the great majority of the Scottish nobles as selfish, wavering, and un principled as their ancestors in the days of Edward, \u2014 supported by the money of England, and ready to sacrifice the independence of their country to their individual ambition ; and if Scotland preserved her liberty as a separate kingdom, which, by the blessing of God, she did, the agents selected for her deliverance were the great body of her people, and the numerous and influential classes of the clergy. 2. The rout at Solway Moss, followed, as we have seen, by the death of the king, gave an alarming advantage to Henry VHI. The Earl of Angus, Sir George Douglas, and the numerous sup porters of their house, still powerful though in banishment, had been long devoted to his interests, in the support of which they saw the only sure hope of their own restoration. To these were added the prisoners of highest rank who were taken in the late disgraceful defeat ; to whom the English monarch now proposed an alternative, trying indeed, but in deciding on which no citizen of a free country ought to have hesitated. On the one hand, they were threatened with imprisonment in the Tower, to which they had been conducted immediately after being taken. On the other, they were promised freedom, and a return to their native countiy, but coupled with extraordinary conditions. A bond was drawn up, which they were required to sign. By it, they acknowledged Henry as lord superior of the kingdom of Scotland ; they promised to exert their influence to procure for him the government of the kingdom, and the resigna tion into his hands of all its fortresses ; they engaged to have then infant queen delivered to his keeping ; and they solemnly stipulated, that if the parliament of Scotland resisted such demands, they would employ then whole feudal strength to cooperate with Eng-"], [163, "A. D. 1542.J MARY. 141 land in completing the conquest of the country. To this engage ment they were required to swear fidelity ; and if they failed in ac complishing the wishes of the king, the penalty was to be then im mediate return to then prisons in England. It must have been ap parent to the Scottish prisoners that such an engagement virtually annihilated the existence of their country as a separate kingdom ; and yet it is mortifying to add that it was embraced by the Earls of Glencairu and Cassillis, and the Lords Maxwell, Somerville, and Oliphant. These were among the chief prisoners taken in the rout of Solway Moss : the rest were of inferior rank, aud remained in captivity ; while Angus, Sir George Douglas, and the strength of their house, cordially co-operated with Henry. 3. It was the policy of these lords on then return to Scotland, to conceal the full extent of then engagements, and to proceed with great caution. On their arrival they sound the country divided into two factions. On the one side, was Cardinal Beaton the chancel lor, supported by the queen-mother, Mary of Guise, the whole body of the clergy, the Roman Catholic nobility, and the interest of France. On the other, were the Earl of Arran, nearest hen to the crown, a weak and indolent man, who leaned to the reformed opin ions, all the nobles who had forsaken the ancient faith, the adher ents of the house of Douglas, and man)- who, ignorant of the unjust aud degrading demands of Henry, considered a marriage with Eng land, under due safeguards, as a wise and politic step. As to the great body of the people, by which we must chiefly understand the middle and commercial classes, then feelings, as far as they can be detected, were somewhat discordant. Many favoured the Reforma tion, and from hostility to the cardinal, gave a virtual support to Hemy \\'H1. and the English faction ; but their feeling of national independence was so strong, that, on the slightest assumption of superiority, it was ready to exhibit itself in determined hostility. 4. Into the details of the straggles between these opposite fac tions, it is unnecessary to enter : we shall relate only the great lead ing events which, even in then most general form, are full of interest. On the death of the king, Beaton produced a will which appointed him chief governor of the realm and guardian to the infant queen ; but the paper was thrown aside as a forged instrument ; Arran, the nearest heir to the crown, was chosen governor ; and the cardinal, having contented himself with seeming the interest and support of France, prepared for a determined straggle with his opponents. At this moment the Douglases and the Solway prisoners arrived, of which party Sir George Douglas, brother to Angus, and father of the celebrated Regent Morton, was the leader. Their first act was bold and successful. Beaton was arraigned of a treasonable cor-"], [164, "LA. D. 15-13. 142 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. respondence with France, and hurried to prison ; a parliament was summoned for the discussion of the proposed alliance with England ; and as the governor, Arran, appeared to be completely under Eng lish influence, it was confidently expected that Henry's schemes oi ambition were not far from their accomplishment. But they were defeated by his own violent and intolerant conduct. He insisted on having the cardinal delivered up to be imprisoned in England ; he upbraided the Douglases for their delay in surrendering the fortresses of the kiugdom ; and, instead of being contented with the proceedings of the parliament, which agreed to the marriage between the Scottish queen and his son, he expressed the most violent re sentment, because the estates insisted that their country should pre serve its liberties as a separate and independent kingdom. 5. Amidst these collisions the secret treachery of the Douglases '. -p, and the Solway lords began to transpire. Beaton nearly . ' ' about the same time recovered his liberty, and, after an in- '_ effectual attempt to secure a matrimonial alliance with England on just and equal grounds, placed himself and the great party of which he became the leader in determined hostility to Heniy. A last effort, however, was made, and a Scottish embassy sought the English court. In a personal interview, the ambassadors ex plained to the king the conditions on which the country would agree to the marriage. To then astonishment, the monarch, over come by passion, proclaimed himself lord paramount of Scotland, and insisted that the government of that kingdom, and the custody of its infant sovereign, belonged of right to him. This disclosure, which was made in a moment of passion, and against the earnest entreaties of the English faction, produced an instantaneous effect. It was received in Scotland, as had been predicted, with a universal burst of indignation. It gave the cardinal and the French party an immediate ascendancy ; the governor, Arran, and his friends joined their ranks ; and the people became so exasperated, that Sadler, the English ambassador, could not safely show himself in the capital. 6. To counteract all these effects, Sir George Douglas exerted himself with indefatigable activity. Henry was prevailed upon to renounce the most obnoxious part of his demands. Arran, with his characteristic caprice, deserted his new friends ; and in a con vention of the nobles, which was not attended by the opposite fac tion, the treaties of marriage and pacification with England were finally arranged. Yet although, as far as it was promulgated to the people, the negotiation now concluded preserved entire the rights and liberties of Scotland, a paper has lately been discovered, drawn up at the same time, and entitled a secret Device, in which the Earls of Angus and Glencairn, with Lord Maxwell, Sir George"], [165, "A. D. 1543.] 143 MARY'. Douglas, and the rest of their party, once more bound themselves to the service of the English king, and promised that, if he did not accomplish the full extent of his designs, he should at least have dominion over the district on this side the Forth. 7. To fulfil the treaty of marriage, however, was found no easy matter. It was averred by the opposite faction, that it had been carried through by private influence, unsanctioned by the highest nobles, unauthorized by any parliament, and contrary to the wishes of the people. At this crisis the cardinal obtained possession of the person of the infant queen, who had hitherto been strictly guarded by the governor and the Hamiltons. To balance this success, Arran, whose character had hitherto been only weak, became alarmed at the success of the cardinal, and, flattered by a proposal of the Eng lish king to make him sovereign of Scotland beyond the Forth, de clared his readiness to co-operate with an English army for the entire subjugation of the countiy. In the mean time, he held a convention of the nobles in the abbey church of Holyrood, and, in his character of governor of the realm, ratified the marriage treaty with England, unmindful of the protestations of Beaton and his adherents, that they were no parties to such a transaction, and would not hold themselves bound by a decision contrary to the opinion of the majority of the nobles and to the wishes of the people. 8. Hemy VUL, enraged by this opposition, acted with his wonted impetuosity and want of principle. He intrigued against the life and liberty of the cardinal, but his plots were unsuccessful ; he seized the ships of the Scottish merchants which were in Eng lish ports, a measure which was deeply resented ; and he assumed that tone of haughty defiance which, when united to his hostile pre parations, made it apparent that war could not be long averted. France now offered her assistance to her ancient ally. The Earl of Arran, ever wavering and irresolute, once more threw his whole influence into Beaton's hands ; and this minister, availing himself of such an accession of strength, proceeded with a vigorous hand to suppress heresy, and to inculcate determined resistance to England. 9. Henry, who was thoroughly unprincipled, and cared not what means he used to rid himself of his opponents, attempted to remove the cardinal, by hiring Brunston, Grange, Rothes, and some of the opposite faction, to seize or assassinate him, but having once more failed in this nefarious project, foiled and irritated, he wreaked his vengeance on the country in a naval invasion. An English fleet of an hundred sail, under Lord Lisle, high admiral, appeared suddenly in the Forth, and disembarked a force which plundered Leith, sacked Edinburgh, which had been deserted by its inhabitants, rav-"], [166, "[A. D. 1544. 144 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. aged the adjoining countiy with merciless cruelty, and left upon land a considerable force, which, in its retreat, was as remorseless in its devastations as the fleet had been in its attack. Such was Henry's mode of wooing, of which it was well observed, that he did too much for a suitor, and too little for a conqueror. 10. It might have been expected that the rival leaders and fac tions in the state, all of whom had suffered by this invasion, would have had their eyes opened to the necessity of saving the country by uniting then strength ; but the cardinal in vain strained every effort to effect so desirable a result. Mutual jealousies, feudal quar rels, renewed intrigues with England, private bonds or covenants among themselves, all co-operated to destroy any cordial union , and the Earls of Lennox and Glencairn, two of the most powerful of the Scottish barons, seized this opportunity to sell themselves to Henry, and to conduct a hostile expedition into the heart ot Scotland. 11. It was at this moment, when all was gloom and despondency, j a j) ! that the Earl of Angus, who, with his brother, had lately ! i f.i.4 ' been restored to his estates, and absolved in parliament ! 11 from the sentence of treason, encountered and totally de feated Sir Ralph Eure and Sir Brian Layton at Ancrum Moor. These English leaders had procured from Henry a grant of all they could conquer in Teviotdale and the Merse, where Angus's estates chiefly lay ; and, penetrating at the head of five thousand men to Melrose, they not only ravaged that district, but plundered the ab bey, and wantonly defaced the tombs of the house of Douglas ; an insult which Angus revenged in the most signal manner, by attack ing the English in their retreat, dispersing their force, with the slaughter of eight hundred men, leaving Eure and Layton dead on the field, and making a capture of one thousand prisoners. 12. This victory, although resulting not from patriotic principle, but personal revenge, had a good effect in restoring confidence to the people ; and it was followed up by the resolution of Francis the First to equip a fleet for the invasion of England, and to assist Scotland by an auxiliary force. Beaton, encouraged by this ex pected aid, having concentrated his party, prevailed upon the ma jority of the nobles, in a convention held in the capital, to refuse every advance of the English monarch, and to declare the treaty of peace and marriage at an end ; while Henry, enraged to the utmost pitch by this success, eagerly encouraged another plot of the Earls of Cassillis, Angus, and Glencairn, for the murder of the cardinal. The king, however, enjoined Sir Ralph Sadler to propose the assas sination, as coming from himself, and the conspirators at this mo ment would not act without Henry's direct approval."], [167, "A.D. 1544.J MARY 145 13. In the midst of these dark plots, a French fleet arrived in Scotland with three thousand men. This led to decisive measures. A Scottish army was assembled ; but, torn as usual by internal dis sensions, and betrayed by the Douglases, who held a principal command, its operations were insignificant, and its retreat almost immediate. This was followed by a cruel invasion of the English, in which the Earl of Hertford, at the head of an army, whose num bers rendered opposition fruitless, invaded Scotland, and after a desolating progress, sent word to his master, that for three hundred years there had not been such ravages committed. Seven monas teries and religious houses, sixteen castles and towns, five market towns, two hundred and forty-three villages, thirteen mills and three hospitals, were burned down during this atrocious expedition ; and there still exists a characteristic letter, in which Henry, on re ceiving some French deserters into his service, enjoins them to shew their attachment by some notable exploit, such as \" trapping or slaying the cardinal.\" He, at the same time, engaged the Earl of Lennox, and Donald, Lord of the Isles, to attack Scotland on the west coasts ; and having heard that Beaton, his able and indefati gable enemy, meditated a visit to France for the purpose of obtain ing a large auxiliary force for the continuance of the war, he deter mined to make a last effort to cut him off, and, with this view, re sumed with the Laird of Brunston the plot for his assassination. 14. Into the details of this remarkable conspiracy, and the va rious parties whom Henry contrived to bring together for the exe cution of his sanguinary purpose, we cannot here enter. Fanati cism of the sternest kind, which had been worked up into action by the cardinal's cruel execution of George Wishart the martyr, united itself to more mercenary motives with some of the conspirators, and to the desire of private revenge with others ; and, on the morning of the 28th of May, a band of desperate men, who are now known to have been in the pay of England, and some of whom had been on former occasions urged by the English king to the commission of the murder, broke into the cardinal's apartments in the castle of St Andrews, beat down the barricades with which the miserable man had attempted to defend the door, and, putting him instantly to death, hung out his naked and mangled body over the window of his bed-chamber, in savage and brutal triumph. They then seized the castle, dismissed unharmed the household servants of the cardinal, sent off a messenger to the English court to inform Henry of their success ; and, being soon after joined by John Knox, and a considerable band of his friends, who considered the death of Beaton as favourable to the reformation, they determined to defend the cas tle for Henry against any force which might be brought against them. G"], [168, "[A. D. 1547. 146 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 15. These confident anticipations were, for a time, overthrown by the death of Henry the Eighth, an event soon followed by that of his rival Francis the First ; but the accession of Edward the Sixth in England, and that of Henry the Second in France, did not materially alter the policy of either kingdom towards Scotland. In England, the protector Somerset, who was placed at the head of the government during the minority of his royal nephew, considered himself bound to enforce the observance of the marriage treaty be tween Edward and the young queen of Scots : while in France, Henry the Second, devoted to the cause of the Catholic church, and directed in his affairs by the Guises, foresaw at once the necessity of an intimate union with Maiy of Guise, the queen-dowager, and the governor Arran ; his policy being to arrest the spread of the reformed opinions, and to weaken England in the quarter to which Somerset looked for an easy triumph. 16. For nine years after the assassination of Beaton, the Earl of Arran continued at the head of the government ; and during that period some events took place, which drew after them important effects. The warlike preparations of Somerset induced the French government to anticipate his motions ; and a French fleet of six teen armed galleons having entered the Frith, bombarded and cap tured the castle of St Andrews, in which the conspirators against Beaton, and Knox the Scottish reformer, had deemed themselves secure. 17. It was when shut up in St Andrews, that this extraordinary I p. man first assumed the office of a minister of the reformed ' \" religion ; bnt having capitulated with the rest, he was em- !_ barked with his associates for France, and on his arrival there, kept a prisoner in chains on board the galleys. He remained on the continent till 1550, when he returned to England, and be came one of the chaplains to Edward the Sixth. 18. Immediately after the siege of St Andrews, the protector Somerset invaded Scotland at the head of an army of fourteen thousand men, and supported by a fleet of thirty-four ships of war. I . p. He was met by Arran, the governor, at Musselburgh, or ' ' Pinkey-cleugh, about six miles from the capital, where an I '_ army considerably more than double the number of the English had encamped in so strong a position on the banks of the Esk, that, with proper military skill on their part, any attempt to dislodge them might have brought ruin on their assailants. The inexperience and folly of Arran, the governor, threw away this ad vantage. He mistook a movement of Somerset, in which the Eng lish leader meant to possess himself of an adjoining height, for an intention to communicate with his fleet, and re-embark his army ;"], [169, "A. D. 1548.] MARY'. 147 and, contrary to the remonstrances of his best officers, he gave or ders for the whole army to strike then tents and cross the river on the banks of which he had encamped. The order was at first re sisted, then unwillingly and imperfectly obeyed ; and, in the midst of the confusion which ensued, the English attacked the Scottish divisions in detail. Fourteen thousand were slain in the battle and in the chase, while the English loss was comparatively trifling. 19. Since the fatal day of Flodden, Scotland had sustained no defeat in the least degree approaching to this at Pinkey ; and, had it been followed up by the Protector, the consequences must have been of the most serious kind, perhaps fatal to the liberty of the country. But happily Somerset, at the very moment of his victoiy, received accounts of a conspiracy which his enemies at the English court had organized against him ; and, impatient to confront them in person, his measures were hurried, confused, and ill digested. After a brief stay in the capital, he commenced his retreat through Teviotdale, and the fleet at the same time weighed anchor and re turned to England. 20. The sanguinary defeat at Pinkey, and the effects of a subse quent cruel inroad into Annandale by Lord Wharton and the Earl of Lennox, greatly exasperated the feelings of national antipathy, and caused the governor and the queen-mother to throw themselves more decidedly into the arms of France. A convention was held at Stirling, in which it was determined to request the immediate assistance of a French force, and to send Maiy, the young Queen of Scots, to be educated at the court of Henry the Second. Soon after wards, the Sienr Montalembert, commonly called Monsieur d'Esse, one of the ablest officers in the service of that country, arrived in Scotland with six thousand men. In a parliament held at Had dington, the marriage of the French Dauphin to the Queen of Scots . _ was finally determined ; and the infant Mary, then in her sixth year, took her voyage to France, accompanied by Lords Erskine and Livingston, her governors, and arrived in safety at the court of St Germains in August 1548. 21. After the departure of the infant queen, a sanguinary and obstinate war took place between England and the united strength of France and Scotland. The slaughter at Pinkey, the burning of their sea-ports and shipping, and the pitiless severity with which the repeated invasions of their countiy were accompanied, had at length animated the Scots with a common feeling of revenge, which gave to the contest a character of peculiar ferocity, and manifested itself in shocking excesses. Happily the straggle did not continue long. The peace of Boulogne, between France and England, led, in 1550, to a cessation of hostilities in Scotland, where, for some"], [170, "[A. D. 1554. 148 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. time before, the tide of success had ran in favour of the go- vernor and his foreign auxiliaries : and thus, after a war 155\u00b0- which lasted for seven years, dating from the year 1543, when Hemy the Eighth determined to enforce the observance of the treaty, the English saw themselves obliged to abandon the project of compelling the Scots into a matrimonial alliance.

The war for the accomplishment of the marriage of the queen i _ was followed not long afterwards by the still more import- ant and eventful struggle for the establishment of the Re \u2022 I 1&54, formation, the history of which may properly be divided into the war of opinion, which extended from the arrival of Knox in Scotland in 1555 to the attack upon Perth in 1559 ; and the ac tual war between the Congregation and their opponents, which was comparatively of short duration, and was concluded by the treaty of Edinburgh, and the triumph of the party of the Congregation, in 1561. The queen-dowager, Mary of Guise, a woman, by the con fession of her enemies, of good judgment and hitherto of upright principles, succeeded in procuring the retirement of Arran, and her own nomination to the regency (April 1554). She was enabled to accomplish this chiefly by the influence of France, then great in Scotland ; but she was assisted also by the leaders of the Protestant party, whom she courted and attached to her interest. Her posses sion of the supreme power was soon followed by the death of Ed ward the Sixth, and the accession of Mary, a princess zealously de voted to the ancient faith ; but these changes were not accompanied by any important political events. The queen-dowager, indeed, when she saw England and Spain engaged in Italy in a struggle"], [171, "A. D. 1557.] MARY. 149 with France and the Pope, deemed it her duty to support her country and attack England : but although the Scottish barons assembled an army, it was only to act on the defensive ; they refused to cross the border, and the regent, hitherto on the most amicable terms with the nobles, dismissed them with undissembled resentment. 2. To make up for this disappointment, the marriage between . -p. the young Queen of Scots and the Dauphin was concluded -J ' with much solemnity at Notre Dame ; and, in a parliament L held at Edinburgh, it was agreed that the youthful hus band should bear the title of King of Scotland during the continuance of the marriage, that all letters in Scotland should run in the joint names of Francis and Mary, and that the arms of both kingdoms should be quartered in the great seal and the current coin of the realm. These transactions had not been long concluded, when Mary of England, broken-hearted by the loss of Calais, and the neglect of Philip, sunk into the grave ; and Elizabeth's accession to the throne was hailed with universal delight by the Protestant party in Europe. 3. When the English queen placed herself at the head of the Reformation, this great moral revolution had made no inconsider able progress in Scotland. The return of Knox to his native coun try in 1555, and the influence which his ardent zeal and popular eloquence soon gained over the Protestant party or Congregation, determined them to make a formal separation from the Catholic Church ; and although the reformer was once more compelled, pro bably by fears for his life, to retreat to Geneva, the danger appears soon to have passed away, and the leaders of the Congregation, conscious of increasing strength, entered into that memorable bond or covenant, by which they engaged to establish the Word of God, to maintain the gospel of Christ, to labour to have faithful minis ters, and to execute judgment upon what they termed the supersti tions and abominations of the ancient faith. 4. This bond was little less than an open declaration of war against the established religion ; and, lest it should be misunder stood, the Lords of the Congregation at the same time passed a resolution, declaring, that in all parishes the book of Common Prayer, by which was meant the service-book of Edward the Sixth, should be read in the churches by the curates, if qualified to perform this service, if not, by others in the parish who were qualified. It was resolved, at the same time, that doctrine, preaching, and the interpretation of Scripture, should be used privately, until it pleased God to move the prince to grant public preaching by faithful ministers. 5. The Roman Catholic clergy received such a denunciation of"], [172, "[A. D. 1558. 150 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the national faith with alarm and indignation ; and, resorting once more to those weapons which had already so deeply injured their cause, they deemed it expedient to hold up an ex- loo\u00b0- ample which should strike terror into the new converts. Walter Mill, a priest who had embraced the doctrines of the Re formation, was seized, tried, delivered over to the secular arm, and burned at St Andrews. The people, however, only execrated the cruelty of which he was the victim ; and his last words were never forgotten : \u2014 \" I am now fourscore and two years old, and could not have lived long by the course of nature ; but a hundred better shall rise out of the ashes of my bones ; and I trust in God I am the last who shall suffer death in Scotland for this cause.\" 6. Against this cruel execution, the Lords of the Congregation, Glencairn, Argyle, Morton, Erskine of Dun, and others, presented a remonstrance to the queen-dowager. It was impossible, they said, that her Grace could be ignorant of the controversy which had arisen between them and the popish clergy, concerning the true re ligion, and the right worshipping of God. They denounced the power which was claimed by these priests of dictating their creed under the penalty of fire and fagot, and declared that, although hitherto they had remained quiescent under such abuses, they now were persuaded that they, \" as part of that power which God had established in the land,\" were bound to defend their persecuted brethren. They proceeded still more boldly to state, that a refor mation of abuses was necessary, not only in religion, but in the temporal government of the state ; and, after claiming for them selves the free right of assembling in public or private, by hearing common prayers, and having the sacrament of the Lord's Supper administered in the vulgar tongue, they concluded by declaring that they were willing that the controversy between themselves and the Catholic priesthood should be determined by a reference to the New Testament, the writings of the fathers, and the laws of the Em peror Justinian. This declaration was soon after followed by a supplication to parliament, in which they requested that all statutes by which churchmen were empowered to proceed against heretics, should be suspended until the controversies in religion were deter mined by a general council of the church. 7. This petition was received by the queen-regent with concealed dissatisfaction, and by the great body of the Roman Catholic clergy with undisguised scorn and reprobation. But it suited the regent at this moment to dissemble. She required the aid of the Protes tant lords to carry in parliament her favourite measure of obtain ing the crown-matrimonial, and the title of King of Scots for the Dauphin ; and entreating the Lords of the Congregation to with-"], [173, "A. D. 1558.] MARY'. 151 draw their petition and articles for a season, she promised them her protection, and a favourable consideration of their demands. To this they agreed, but under a protestation which was publicly read in parliament. By the manner in which it was worded, this document proved that they knew their own strength, and, in the event of a refusal, were prepared to enforce their demand for liberty of conscience, and a thorough reformation of the church. 8. It was at this crisis, when the Lords of the Congregation had taken their stand on the ground which they never afterwards aban doned, and when the queen-regent, having obtained her wishes, con sidered herself independent of then support, that Elizabeth succeed ed to the throne, and that Knox again arrived in his native country- Both events produced the most important effects. It was one of the great principles of Elizabeth's policy to increase her own secu rity by weakening her neighbours. To accomplish this, she inva riably fomented a secret faction which opposed itself to the existing government. We have already seen how lightly the feudal nobi lity of Scotland were accustomed to regard the power of the crown, or the laws of the realm, if they interfered in any prominent man ner with their personal freedom or privileges ; and the history of the country, from the rebellion in the reign of James the Third, to the moment when they so recently refused to lead then forces against England, had exhibited little else than the destruction of any ba lance between the fierce unbridled license of the aristocracy, and the decreasing influence of the crown and the laws. 9. Of those nobles who had been ready, without any feelings of shame, to renounce their allegiance to then country, and to be bought over by England, many had embraced the principles of the Refor mation. To men so long accustomed to make their personal inte rest the measure of their duty, and to think and act as they pleased, a revolution must have warmly recommended itself on many grounds both public and private ; and when they considered the history of the English Reformation, and the appropriation of the church lands by Henry and Edward, they could not, we may believe, be totally insensible to the lesson. The Church of Rome in Scotland was com paratively as rich as her sister had been across the border ; and, if the Reformation was to be as complete in then own country as in England, it was not difficult for these shrewd barons to persuade themselves that they might imitate, perhaps improve the example. 10. Over an aristocracy of such a character, Elizabeth and her ministers at once perceived how easy it would be to acquire an in fluence. Her policy at home was to avoid war, and to enforce, in every department of the state, the most rigid economy. Her policy abroad, as already observed, was to give her neighbours full em-"], [174, "[A. D. 1558. 152 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ployment within then own realm, by secretly encouraging every faction which rose against the government. From the first moment of her accession, therefore, she favoured the leaders of the Congre gation, directed their measures, supported them with money, and received from them in return a respect and deference superior to that which they paid to then own sovereign. 11. But if the effects of the accession of Elizabeth upon the body of the Scottish nobles, were important in reference to the Reforma tion, the consequences of Knox's reappearance were not less mo mentous upon the character of the people. Hitherto the healthy patriotic feeling, the resolution to defend their independence as a separate kingdom from foreign domination and attack, had existed almost exclusively in the middle and lower orders, the commercial classes, and the labourers of the soil. But among these, the prin ciples of the Reformation had taken a deep root. They had adopted them, not like many of the nobles, from interest, but from convic tion ; and upon then minds the popular eloquence of Knox, his ar dent zeal, his denunciations of superstition, his sarcastic attacks upon the ignorance and the vices of his opponents, produced a powerful impression. Till this period, they had been wont to regard France as their ancient ally, and England as their ancient enemy. But France was now held forth to them, in the discourses of their favourite preacher, as then bitterest foe, because the enemy of then soul's health ; while England was the land of gospel light, and its queen the princess to whom, as the bulwark of the truth, they ought to look with affection and admiration. 12. Such were the feelings of the Scottish nobles, and the great body of the people, with reference to the momentous straggle be tween the Reformation and the Roman Catholic faith, which was now about to convulse the country. Had the queen-dowager con tinued to act with the same judgment and caution which had dis tinguished the commencement of her government, it is possible that the straggle might have been for a time averted ; but at this mo ment, the powerful princes of the house of Guise deemed it expe dient to join the league which had been concluded between the pope, the king of Spain, and the emperor, for the destruction of the Protestant religion, and the re-establishment of the Catholic faith in Europe. They immediately communicated with then sister, the regent, in Scotland ; and such was unfortunately their influence over her mind, that, after a feeble resistance, she joined the papal coalition. 13. This fatal step was followed, as might have been expected, by an immediate collision between the two parties. In a conven tion of the clergy, which was held at Edinburgh in March 1559,"], [175, "JOHN KNOX, THE REFORMER Bom 1505. Died 1572"], [176, ""], [177, "A. D. 1559.] MARY. 153 the Lords of the Congregation, in addition to the demands which they had already presented, insisted that bishops should not hence forward be elected without the consent of the gentlemen of the dio cese, nor parish priests except by the votes of the parishioners. These proposals were met by the queen with a determined refusal. A proclamation was issued, commanding all persons to resort daily to mass and confession. It was declared that no language but the Latin could be used in public prayers, without violating the most sacred decrees of the church ; and the Protestant ministers who had acted in defiance of these injunctions, were summoned to ap pear at Stirling, there to answer to the accusations which should be brought against them. 14. They accordingly did appear ; but it was with Knox at then head, and surrounded by crowds of their devoted followers, who were led by the principal barons of Angus and Mearns. On reach ing Perth, however, it was judged expedient to attempt a measure of conciliation ; and Erskine of Dun, a gentleman of ancient family and grave experience, leaving his brethren, proceeded to the court at Stirling, where he was admitted to an interview with the regent. He assured her that their single demand was to be allowed to wor ship God according to their conscience, and to secure liberty for their preachers. She replied, that, if he would prevail on the Con gregation to disperse, their preachers should be unmolested, the summons discharged, and their grievances redressed. 15. To this Erskine consented. He communicated the agree ment to his brethren who had remained at Perth ; the people were disbanded ; and when the reformers looked for toleration and re dress, the queen-dowager, with a perfidy which was as base as it was unwise, reiterated the summons, and, on their failing to appear, denounced the ministers as rebels. Such conduct inflamed the re sentment of the Congregation to the utmost degree ; and Knox hav ing seized the moment to deliver a stern and impassioned sermon against idolatry, the people were wrought up to a state of high ex citement. Observing a priest about to celebrate mass, after the preacher had retired, they burst in upon the altar, tore down its ornaments, shivered the shrines and relics, and speedily demolished every monument which seemed to savour of idolatry. From that moment the fate of the Roman Catholic church in Scotland was - t \u2014 rr- decided. Having once broken through restraint, and found their own strength, the multitude rushed to the religious I houses of the Black and Grey friars, and inflicted on them an equally summary vengeance. They then attacked the charter house or Carthusian monastery, which experienced a similar fate ; and the infection of tumult and destruction spreading throughout"], [178, "[A.D 1559. 154 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the country, many excesses of the same kind were committed in the provincial towns. 16. The effects of such scenes on the queen-dowager were to rouse her to instant activity, and to array the two parties in deter mined opposition to each other ; for although some of the Protestant leaders, disclaiming all intentions of rebellion, disapproved of the late violence, and still acted with the regent, their neutrality was so short-lived that it scarcely demands attention. It had the effect, however, of producing a momentary spirit of conciliation. The Protestants presented addresses to the queen-dowager, to the no bility, and to the Roman Catholic clergy. In the first, they pro fessed their loyalty, deprecated her injustice, and demanded liberty of conscience, and the right of hearing their own preachers. In the second, they vindicated their conduct to their brethren of the Ro man Catholic nobility from the charge of heresy and sedition, while they upbraided those who first espoused and now deserted their cause. The third epistle to the Roman Catholic clergy, whom they broadly stigmatised as the generation of antichrist, was a denunci ation of war, composed in that spirit of coarse and abusive railing, which unfortunately marks the style of the early reformers. Such accusations were little calculated to produce pacific feelings ; but the queen-regent, who had assembled her army, finding it inferior in strength to the Congregation, proposed an armistice, which, on certain conditions, was accepted. The Congregation having bound themselves to each other in a new covenant, disbanded their forces, and for the second time, as they allege, were overreached by the treachery of the queen-dowager, who, against a solemn stipulation, occupied Perth with a body of French soldiers, expelled the magis trates who favoured the Reformation, and garrisoned the town with Scottish troops in the pay of France. 17. This unwise and unjustifiable duplicity was productive of the worst effects. The Lord James, afterwards the Regent Moray, a young man of great talents and ambition, who had hitherto adhered to the regent, though professing reformed opinions, deserted her. Argyle, a powerful and influential nobleman, followed his example; and, faithful to their renewed covenan t, the army of the Congrega tion assembled in strength at St Andrews. Knox, in the mean time, whose voice, Sadler, the English ambassador, compares, in his letters, to the sound of a thousand trumpets, set out on a preaching tour through the country. Directing his powerful eloquence against the evils of superstition, and the misery of the thraldom which, by means of foreign mercenaries, the house of Guise were attempting to fix upon their country, he so powerfully excited the people, that they determined to take the reformation into their own hands, and"], [179, "A. D. 1559.] mary. 155 proceeded to level with the ground the monasteries of the Francis can and Dominican orders. It was in vain that the regent exerted herself to check these popular outrages. The enthusiasm gained strength ; and the nobles and leaders of the Congregation feeling proportionally encouraged, advanced with then forces upon Perth, opened a cannonade, and in a short time made themselves masters of the town. Stimulated to a high pitch of excitement by such success, the multitude, contrary to the entreaties of Knox, attacked and destroyed the abbey church and palace of Scone ; after which, a portion of the army of the Congregation, under the Lord James and Argyle, made a rapid march upon Stirling, which they occupied, and afterwards hastened to Linlithgow ; and, having in both towns pulled down the altars, destroyed the shrines, and, as they said, purged the places of idolatry, they compelled the regent to make a rapid retreat to Dunbar, and entered the capital in triumph, in June 1559. 18. This last success, while it gave the highest corn-age to the party of the reformation, convinced the queen-regent that every hope of avoiding a civil war must be abandoned, and that the crisis called for her most determined exertions. She instantly commu nicated her dangerous situation to France, and received in return a large reinforcement of French troops, whose discipline, skill, and equipment, being superior to the common feudal militia which the Congregation brought into the field, at once gave her a superiority. The reformers, on the other hand, threw themselves upon the pro tection of England ; and Elizabeth, although she scrupled to send them either money or troops, encouraged them with general promises of approval, and, in case of extreme danger, with hopes of support. In addition to this, her minister Cecil hinted, in his letters, the expediency of using their present power to \"strip the Romish Church of its pomp and wealth,\" and, as he termed it, \"to apply good things to good uses ;\" while the terms in which the Congrega tion replied, seemed to point to a more secret communication, in which this unscrupulous politician had advised the deposition of the regent, and a change of the government. It is certain, that the necessity of such a measure had been for some time contemplated by the Congregation, but it was to be resorted to as the last ex tremity. Kirkcaldy of Grange, one of then principal leaders, in a letter addressed to Sir Henry Percy, (1st of July 1559), and expla natory of their intentions, declared that, if the regent would consent to a reformation conformable to the pure Word of God, cleanse the popish churches of all monuments of idolatry, suffer the Book of Common Prayer published by Edward VI. to be read, and send"], [180, "[A. D. 1560. 156 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. away the French troops, they were ready to obey and serve her, and to annex the whole revenues of the abbeys to the crown. 19. For the queen-dowager to have agreed to this, would have been equivalent to the giving up of the whole question, and would have been to establish Protestantism on the rains of what she esteemed the true church. She accordingly met the demands of the Congregation with a peremptory refusal. In return, they with drew from her their allegiance, and in the name of their sovereign, whose authority they unscrupulously assumed, suspended her from the high office which she had abused. 20. The war now broke out with a violence proportioned to the exasperated feelings of both factions. The Congregation, at first intimidated by the superiority in the discipline of the French troops, began to dread a calamitous result ; but they soon saw themselves strengthened by the arrival of an English fleet, while a land force, under the Duke of Norfolk, advanced to Berwick, and after a nego tiation with the reformed leaders, pushed forward into Scotland, and was joined at Preston by the army of the reformers. 21. Happily for both countries, the war was of brief duration. The queen-dowager, sinking under a broken constitution, died at Edinburgh on the 10th of June 1560. The Congregation, dis heartened by some reverses, and weakened by disunion among their . y. principal leaders, felt no inclination to prolong the strug- ' * gle ; and Elizabeth having offered her services as a media i 1 trix between the two parties, a meeting of the English, French, and Scottish commissioners took place at Edinburgh, by whom a treaty of peace was concluded, having for its basis the withdrawal of the French troops from Scotland, and a recognition of the validity of the treaty of Berwick between Elizabeth and the party of the Congregation. Into this last proviso, the French com missioners, sent over by the young Queen of Scots and her husband the Dauphin, were entrapped by the diplomatic skill of Sir William Cecil, one of the English commissioners, contrary to their express instructions ; and its validity was never admitted by the Scottish queen ; but, in the meantime, it greatly strengthened the hands of the Congregation. At the same time, the leaders of this party presented to the commissioners certain \"articles\" concerning re ligion ; but Elizabeth had directed Cecil and Wotton to decline all discussion upon the subject ; and the reformers, who looked to the convention of estates for the settlement of the question, did not press the point. 22. A parliament accordingly assembled at Edinburgh, on the 10th of July 1560. The lesser barons, who had for some time suf fered their right of sitting in the convention of estates to fall into"], [181, "A. D. 1560.] MARY. 157 disuse, were mostly attached to the doctrmes of the reformers, and looked with deep interest to the debates which were about to take place on the subject of religion. They accordingly met, claimed their right, and, after some opposition, were allowed to take their place. This threw a preponderating weight into the party of the Congre gation ; and the \" Confession of Faith,\" together with a \" Book of Discipline,\" which embodied the great principles of the reformed church, and protested against the errors, abuses, and superstitions of the Roman Catholic faith, was submitted to parliament. The Confession of Faith passed with little opposition. This remarkable paper, or rather treatise, professes to be a summary of Christian doctrine founded on the Word of God ; and, although drawn up by Knox and his brethren in a very short space, embodied the result of much previous study and consultation. 23. Three acts followed the adoption of this Confession of Faith. The first abolished for ever in Scotland the power and jurisdiction of the pope ; the second repealed all former statutes passed in fa vour of the Romish church ; the third inflicted the highest penalties upon any who thenceforward should dare to say or to hear mass. 24. All this met with little opposition ; but the Book of Disci pline, by which the future government of the church was to be de termined, gave rise to the keenest debates. Some of the nobles and barons at once refused to sign it ; others did sign, but eluded its injunctions ; others mocked at its provisions, and called them \" de vout imaginations.\" The cause of this is attributed by Knox to its interfering with the privileges and property of many powerful barons, who had already \" griped the possessions of the church.\" It also discouraged other expectants, \" who thought they would not lack their part of Christ's coat.\" The first class, according to the same authority, had no remorse of conscience, or intention to restore anything of that which they had long stolen or reft. The second were no doubt afraid, that, if the ministers were first provided for, little or nothing would be left for them. 25. In considering the provisions of the Book of Discipline, it is material to notice, that it committed the election of ministers solely to the people ; using, however, the precaution that each minister so chosen, before he was admitted to the holy office, should be exa mined and approved of by the ministers and elders, upon all points of controversy between the Church of Rome and the Congregation ; after which he was to be considered an ordained minister, without any further solemnity ; it being observed, that, although the apostles used the imposition of hands, it was intended to impart, and did impart, miraculous powers, and \" the miracle having ceased, the using the ceremony was judged henceforth unnecessary.\""], [182, "158 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. [A. D. 1560. The country was divided into ten dioceses, over which ten minis ters, named superintendents, were appointed, whose duty it was to be ambulatory preachers, and to inquire, in the course of their pro gress, into the lives of the clergy, the provision for the poor, and the proper instruction of youth. It is in this last clause that we meet with the first proposal of that admirable institution of parish schools, to which Scotland has since owed so much of her prospe rity. Having thus accomplished the reformation, the parliament appointed an interim provisional government, confirmed the treaty of Berwick which had been entered into between Elizabeth and the Congregation, and proposed that, as a basis of perpetual amity be tween England and Scotland, there should be a marriage between Queen Elizabeth and the Earl of Arran, heir-apparent to the crown. In conclusion, they dispatched Sir James Sandilands of Calder to carry an account of their proceedings to their sovereigns in France, while Sir William Maitland of Lethington, with the Earls of Morton and Glencairn, were sent on a similar mission to Elizabeth. 26. It was not to be expected that Mary, educated in the bosom of the Roman Catholic church, and accustomed to look for direc tion and guidance to the advice of her uncles the Guises, would ratify the extraordinary proceedings of this parliament. It had, by a few sweeping acts, abolished the national faith, and confirmed the treaty which a faction of her subjects, whom she had all along treated as rebels, had entered into with England. By sending an embassy to Elizabeth, composed of men of higher rank and greater influence than Sandilands, who was deputed to wait upon their sovereign, it was, at the same time, intimated pretty significantly, that the Congregation were determined to treat the English prin cess with equal if not superior deference to that with which they regarded their own queen. She accordingly received the Scottish envoy with coldness, and peremptorily refused to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh."], [183, "159 CHAPTER XVI. A. D. 1560 to 1568. Mary. CHRONOLOGY OF THE PERIOD.

At this period, Mary had the misfortune to lose her husband, Francis H., the young king of France ; an event which made it necessary for her to return to her own kingdom, and at once threw her from a condition of much contentment and prosperity into cir cumstances of extraordinary trial and embarrassment. She had been educated in the most brilliant and accomplished, but, it must be added, one of the most profligate courts in Europe. From her infancy, as queen of Scotland, and presumptive queen of France, she had been flattered and caressed; and as she was extremely beautiful, possessed of amiable manners, highly accomplished, gene rous, and kind hearted, she had received from every class of her French subjects the unaffected homage of then admiration and re gard. All was now to be changed ; and on turning her eyes from France to her own countrv, a melancholy contrast presented it self. 2. As soon as the king's death was known in Scotland, a parlia ment assembled at Edinburgh, of which the proceedings appear to have been overruled by the Congregation. It was resolved to in vite their sovereign to return to her native kingdom, and for this purpose to send the Lord James to France, while the Roman Catholic party dispatched Lesley, afterwards Bishop of Ross, on the same errand. The Lord James, afterwards the Regent Moray, was the natural son of James V. by Lady Margaret Erskine, who subsequently married the Laird of Lochleven. From his earliest years he had exhibited marks of an extraordinary ambition, and a genius for affairs of state. His apparently blunt and careless man ner disposed men to treat him with confidence, and enabled him, wheri he was least suspected, to cany on the most deep-laid and ambitious designs. At this time he was regarded as the leader of the reformed party ; and it is a remarkable proof of his talents,"], [184, "160 [A. D. 1561. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. that, on his arrival in France, although at first suspected by Mary, he soon acquired an extraordinary influence over her. 3. It was the misfortune of the queen of Scots, who was now only eighteen, that she was surrounded by difficulties, to meet which would have required a matured experience, and the most at tached and faithful councillors. Elizabeth, who saw her opportu nity, and was determined not to lose it, dispatched the Earl of Bedford to demand the confirmation of the treaty of Edinburgh ; and when this was refused, she exhibited her resentment by de claring that Mary, who had at first intended to pass through Eng land into her own realm, should not receive a safe-conduct ; a cir cumstance which made the latter resolve to sail at once from Dieppe to Leith. But Elizabeth was at least an open opponent, and the young queen, aware of her enmity, could secure herself against it. Moray, on the other hand, to whom she too heedlessly gave her confidence, had already visited the English court on his passage to France, communicated his plans to Elizabeth, and received his in structions from Cecil, her prime minister. On his return from Paris he again passed through England, consulted with the English queen on the best methods of detaining Mary in France, and ac tually carried his double dealing so far as to devise means for inter cepting her, should she persist in her determination and set sail. This she at last determined to do at all risks ; and having had the good fortune to escape the English cruisers, which were directed to be on the look-out, she arrived at Leith, and was received with the utmost enthusiasm by all classes of her subjects (August 19. 1561). 4. These happy indications were of short duration ; and when the young queen considered the state of parties in Scotland, the dif ficulties of her situation appeared complicated and disheartening. She was herself a conscientious Roman Catholic, warmly attached to France and the Guises her uncles. This of itself rendered her an object of suspicion and aversion to Knox, the great leader of the Protestant clergy, and to the powerful nobles who had espoused the reformation. She had already peremptorily refused to sanction the proceedings of the Parliament, which had confirmed the treaty of Berwick, abolished the papal supremacy, and substituted the Pro testant doctrines and worship for the ancient faith. This drew upon her the enmity of England, and of the English party in Scot land, led by Moray and Lethington ; and as the influence of Knox and the other preachers over their congregations was strong and universal, the feelings of the ministers were communicated to the great body of the people, and checked those sentiments of lojalty which manifested themselves upon her arrival. If, from such op ponents, Maiy turned to the body of her Roman Catholic nobles,"], [185, "A. D. 1562-63.] 161 MARY among whom the most powerful and influential was the Earl of Huntly, she found them animated by a community of sentiment upon this subject ; but then they, in common with all the-nobles, had been so long accustomed to independence, and looked so con stantly to the preservation and increase of their own power, that, as a party, they were extremely difficult to manage. Lastly, look ing to the great body of the Roman Catholic clergy, there was no one (if we except Lesley,) who, since the death of Beaton, had possessed that vigour of character and that talent for state affairs, which were absolutely necessary in any minister to whom the queen should give her confidence. 5. It was necessary for Mary, however, to decide upon a line of policy ; and, after deliberate consideration, she determined to make the Lord James her chief minister, and to secure the friendship and good offices of Elizabeth. In this way she hoped to attach to her self the great body of her people, who were mostly Protestants ; and as from France, torn at this moment by civil and religious dis sensions, she could expect little assistance, she deemed it the more necessary to preserve peace with England. Events of much inte rest now succeeded each other with a startling rapidity, and the history of Mary, in the brief circle of six years, presented an ap palling tragedy. 6. The first point on which the two queens came into collision was on the delicate subject of marriage. Maiy's subjects wished her to many, and she considered it wise and necessary that she should gratify their wishes. She was in the bloom of youth, ex tremely beautiful, and of manners so engaging and attractive, that few could see her without sentiments of admiration and regard. She was queen of Scotland, and, after Elizabeth, undoubted heir to the English throne ; though the latter queen, from her morbid jea lousy upon the subject of the succession, had never recognised her right. Maiy's great object, at this moment, was to many with her approbation, and to procure a declaration of her right of succession to the throne, failing Elizabeth's issue. She accordingly declared that she would regard her advice upon this subject as that of a mother, and consulted her sister of England with an openness and devotion, which, if not prudent, appears to have been perfectly sin cere. 7. In return for this confidence, the conduct of the queen of . England was marked by that insincerity, selfishness, and ' A- -D- want of truth which almost uniformly characterized her | policy. She was determined that, if Mary did many, she 1 1 sio should lower herself by the alliance ; but she would have \u2014 been still better pleased could she have so ordered matters g 2"], [186, "[A. D. 1562-63. 162 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. that she should not marry at all ; and, guided by this ungenerous object, Elizabeth commenced a system of intrigue, the sole object of which was mystification and delay, and in which she enjoyed the satisfaction, not only of deceiving Mary and her councillors, but of setting her own ministers at fault, and rendering it impossible for them to decipher her real intentions. In the course of these nego tiations, after objecting to every foreign alliance, the English queen at last proposed her own favourite, Leicester, and held out as a bait to Mary, who justly deemed such an alliance beneath her rank, the promise that the issue, if any, of this marriage, should succeed to the English throne. Nothing can be more certain than that she had no such intention ; but the farce was so well acted, that not only Mary and the Lord James, now Earl of Moray, but Randolph, the English ambassador at the Scottish court, were deceived ; and when at last it was discovered that, from first to last, Elizabeth had been playing her usual dark and double game under the mask of friendship, the indignation of the sufferers was roused, as might have been expected, to the highest pitch. 8. An almost immediate and violent reaction took place. Mary had hitherto confided in Elizabeth, and consulted her upon the marriage. She now trusted her no longer, and determined, with out delay, to follow her own inclination. Since her arrival in her dominions, she had favoured the Protestants and rather repressed the Roman Catholics. She was now disposed to reverse the sys tem. She had hitherto chosen Moray and Lethington as her chief ministers, and had entrusted to the former almost regal power, loaded him with estates and honours, and placed him at the head of her nobility ; and it was by Moray and Lethington's advice that she had shaped her policy towards England : but the road they marked out for her had led to insult, mortification, and defeat. Was it possible, then, that she should continue to these two men, or to the Protestant party, whom they represented, the confidence with which she had regarded them ? Or rather, was it not natural that, when she discovered their devotedness to Elizabeth, who had deceived and injured her, she should regard them with suspicion and distrust ? 9. Under these circumstances, and when agitated by such feel ings, Mary saw the Lord Darnley, the eldest son of the Earl of Lennox, who, with his father, had lately returned to Scotland. This young nobleman could boast of royal descent, his grandmother being a sister of Henry the Eighth, and he himself, next to Mary, the nearest heir to the English throne. He was now in his twenty first year, and had not yet manifested that weak intellect and pro pensity to low vices which betrayed themselves soon after his mar-"], [187, "A. D. 1565.] 163 MARY. riage. It was the misfortune of the Scottish queen that she acted from impulse. She had been deceived by Elizabeth, and she de | . p. i termined to shew her that she could choose for herself. | |k-/ Without giving herself time to study his disposition, and I . purposely abstaining from any previous communication of 1565. Retentions to the English queen, she selected Darnley as her future husband, and dispatched Lethington to Eli zabeth, not, as before, to ask her counsel, but to inform her of her resolution. 10. The consequences of this step were extraordinary. Darnley and his father were strongly suspected of being Roman Catholics. Moray and Lethington saw in this alliance little else than the de molition of their own power; the party of Knox and the kirk ap prehended the restoration of the ancient religion ; and Elizabeth not only declared herself hostile to the alliance, but bitterly accused the Scottish queen, insisted that Lennox and Darnley were English, not Scottish subjects, and sent them orders to repair instantly to her court. It was hardly to be expected that so ridiculous a command would be obeyed, and the opposition of Elizabeth only rendered Mary more determined npon the marriage. A convention of her nobility was held at Stirling ; it was numerously attended ; the queen communicated to them her intention of marrying Darnley ; the measure was approved without a dissentient voice ; and although Moray and the faction with whom he acted attempted to instigate the people to opposition and rebellion, the endeavour was signally unsuccessful, and the queen canied her wishes into effect. She was married to Darnley in the chapel of Holyrood, on the 29th of July 1565. 11. Previously to the queen's marriage, Moray, Argyle, Leth ington, and the party of the kirk, had been encouraged by Eliza beth to rise against their sovereign ; and, had they received the assistance which she promised, the result might have led to the de thronement of her whom they represented as the oppressor of her nobility, and the bitter enemy of the truth. But then schemes were defeated by the energy and promptitude of the Scottish queen and the timid parsimony of her sister of England. It was in vain that Moray and the other insurgents reminded Cecil of their desperate situation, and the necessity of speedy assistance, both in money and in soldiers. Neither the one nor the other could be wrung from Elizabeth. They were proclaimed traitors, driven from one posi tion to another by the queen of Scots, who herself headed the forces which took the field against them, and were at last compelled to flee to England and throw themselves upon the protection of Eliza beth. To their dismay she disowned and repulsed them, upbraided"], [188, "[A. D. 1565. 164 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Moray as a traitor to his royal mistress ; and, although herself the encourager of their revolt, compelled them publicly to declare that she knew nothing of the matter. They were then dismissed from the queen's presence, and permitted to retire to Carlisle, where the Earl of Bedford received secret instructions to supply their wants during their banishment. 12. While such was the course of events in England, Mary's satisfaction in the triumph over the rebels was grievously diminished by discovering that her husband was weak and profligate, the dupe of eveiy artful companion whom he met, and unworthy of the con fidence and affection with which she had treated him in the first ardour of her passion. To entrust him with any responsible share in the government was impossible ; and Moray's friends who re mained at court, and watched the increasing estrangement between the queen and her husband, determined to turn it to then own ad vantage. 13. Mary had now few or no servants whom she could trust. Her secretary, Maitland of Lethington, had betrayed her interests to Elizabeth, and was in disgrace ; and, in the meantime, she had availed herself of the services of Riccio, her foreign secretary. This person had entered her service at first as a singer in her band, but had afterwards, by his skill and fidelity, raised himself to this confidential employment, much to the annoyance of the young king, who regarded him with peculiar aversion ; and, incredible as it may appear, Darnley having persuaded himself that he had stolen from him the affections of the queen, resolved to assassinate him. Nor was it difficult, among a fierce and unscrupulous nobility, to find associates in this flagitious scheme. His father the Earl of Lennox, Morton the lord chancellor, Lethington the ex-secretary, Moray, and his friends who were in banishment, and many of the support ers of the Reformation, who suspected Riccio of intriguing with the papal court, willingly joined in the conspiracy. The parnament was at hand, in which it was intended to pronounce sentence against the banished lords : it had been reported that measures were in preparation for the establishment of the Roman Catholic faith ; and it was determined to arrest both the one and the other, by striking the blow against Riccio. Accordingly, when Mary, who was then pregnant, sat at supper in a small cabinet adjoining her bed-room, in the palace of Holyrood, the king led the conspira tors up a secret stair which communicated with the apartment, \u25a0 . r) while the Earl of Morton and a band of armed soldiers I 1 ' ' seized the gates ot the palace. The Countess of Argyle, I L Erskine, captain of her guard, the comptroller of her house hold, Riccio, her secretaiy, and one or two domestic servants."], [189, "A. D. 1565.] MARY. 165 formed the queen's party, some sitting at table, and others being in attendance. Indeed, the little closet or cabinet was so small, that three or four persons could with difficulty have seated themselves. But its nanow dimensions prevented escape, and favoured the ferocious purposes of the conspirators. Led by the king, they burst into the cabinet, overturned the table, and threw themselves upon Riccio, who sprang for protection behind the queen. In a moment his fate was decided. One ruffian threatened Mary with his dagger, another held a pistol to her breast, a third, snatching the king's dagger, stabbed Riccio over her shoulder ; and at last, tearing him from the closet, amidst the shrieks of the women, and the shouts and execrations of the conspirators, they dispatched him, or rather cut him to pieces, in an adjoining apartment, with fifty-six wounds. 14. After this atrocious murder, which, considering the situation of the queen, might have cost her and her infant their lives, the conspirators detained her as a prisoner in her palace, permitted no one but the king and their own party to hold any communication with her, and, having been joined next morning by the Earl of Moray and the exiles from Carlisle, determined to make a complete change in the government. Darnley, weak and profligate as he was, they rewarded by placing at the head of their new system, being well aware that he would soon be their tool. The queen was to be confined in Stirling till she should consent to the full establishment of the reformed religion ; and the Earl of Moray and his associates were to be restored to their former favour and power. In a single day all these intentions were overturned. Maiy, left alone with her husband, regained her ascendency over him ; she convinced him of the perfidy of Morton, Ruthven, and his associates, obtained from him a confession of all the secrets of the conspiracy, escaped with him to Dunbar, and being instantly joined by eight thousand men, advanced with such rapidity against the conspirators, that they fled in dismay to Berwick, and solicited the protection of Elizabeth. 15. Darnley, in his confessions to Mary, had betrayed his brother conspirators,*whilst he solemnly asserted his own innocence ; but Morton and his associates produced, in then own defence, various bonds and letters, which were signed by the king, and fully esta blished his guilt ; and Maiy saw, to her inexpressible grief and dis gust, that the cruel outrage was planned by her husband. From that moment this miserable prince became an object of contempt and aversion to all. His conduct had been a tissue of cowardice, cruelty, falsehood, and weakness ; and the unhappy queen, without a stay to rest on, fell into a state of the deepest despondency. Whom, indeed, could she trust? Moray and his party had but re-"], [190, "[A. D. 1566. 166 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. cently been rebels, Morton and his associates were stained by the blood of her confidential servant, murdered at her knees, the lung was the chief conspirator, the queen of England had deceived her, the party of Knox and the Scottish church regarded her with avowed aversion, and even the Roman Catholics were somewhat estranged by the preference which at first she had given to then opponents. Under these complicated difficulties, the queen pursued the course which she deemed most likely to ensure success. She broke with none, pardoned some of the conspirators, affected to believe her hus band, and restored Moray to some portion of the power of which . -\u00a3. he had been deprived. Such was the state of things, when, 1 ' ' the period for her confinement having anived, she, in the 1 castle of Edinburgh, gave birth to a son, who was named James Charles. 16. When her recovery permitted Mary to attend to the affairs of the countiy, it was apparent that, unless immediate steps were taken to establish something like a strong government, the kingdom would fall to pieces ; and yet such was the weakness and treacher ous nature of the king, that to admit him to a share in it was im possible. She next turned to her nobles, of whom the most power ful were Moray, Bothwell, Huntly, Argyle, Lennox, Morton, and Lethington ; but there had long existed a feud between Moray and Bothwell, while Morton, Lethington, Lennox, and their partizans, were still in disgrace for the murder of Riccio. It was necessary to make an effort, and the queen succeeded in reconciling Moray and Bothwell : Huntly was made chancellor, Lethington was pardoned and restored to his office of secretary ; while Moray, Argyle his brother-in-law, and Bothwell, were entrusted with the chief ma nagement of her affairs. 17. Enraged at his exclusion from power, the king sullenly re tired from court, threatened to murder the Earl of Moray, and at last declared he would leave the kingdom. It was in vain that his father remonstrated against this resolution ; in vain that the queen herself, leading him before her council, conjured him to detail his grievances, and, if she had injured him in any respeet, to accuse her without reserve. He declared she had herself given him no cause of complaint ; but afterwards, in a letter, he complained that he had no power in the state, and that he was neglected by the no bility, which he would bear no longer. Soon after this, the unhappy princess was seized with a fever at Jedburgh, during which her life was despaired of. Her enemies ascribed it to the injurious effects of a rapid ride which she took from Jedburgh to visit Bothwell, who had been wounded in a skirmish with some border thieves ; it had more probably its origin in the anxiety which followed the conduct"], [191, "A. D. 1566.] MARY. 167 of Darnley ; but be this as it may, she recovered only to be the victim of more aggravated sufferings. Partial reconciliations were followed by no revival of affection or confidence ; and in the anguish of a wounded spirit, she sometimes lamented that she had not died at Jedburgh. 18. It was in this season of depression and despair that Moray and Maitland proposed to her a divorce from the king. They had previously confided their project to Huntly, Argyle, and Bothwell ; and at first Mary seemed inclined to follow then advice, provided the divorce could be legally procured, and without prejudice to her child. But, after weighing the whole matter, her opinion changed, and when Maitland urged that means could be found to free her of Darnley without injury to her son, declaring that Moray would look on and say nothing against it, she broke off the conference. \"I will,\" said she, \"that ye do nothing through which any spot may be laid to my honour or conscience ; let the matter be in the state it is, abiding till God of His goodness put remedy thereto.\" 19. Having failed in this device, a conspiracy for the murder of the king was entered into by Maitland, Bothwell, Huntly, Argyle, and Sir James Balfour. It has been disputed whether Moray was, or was not, a party to this atrocious design. It is certain that he did not sign the bond by which, according to the custom of the age, the conspirators bound themselves to each other. There is a strong presumption, however, that he knew of its existence ; and the deed was communicated to Morton and his associates, who signed it, and agreed to support the conspirators in the execution of then purpose. Such was the state of matters when the baptism of the young prince took place at Stirling. From this ceremony the king obstinately absented himself, alleging in excuse the neglect and rigour with which he was treated. Soon afterwards he left the court, and re tired to Glasgow, where he was seized with the small-pox, and ap peared in imminent danger. His situation appeared to awaken the tenderness of the queen. She sent her own physician to wait on him, and soon after she herself visited him, and ministered to his wants. When his convalescence permitted him to be removed, she returned with him to Edinburgh, and placed him, for the benefit of the air, in a house in the suburbs, called the Kirk-of- Field. It was here that the conspirators determined to carry their dreadful pur pose into effect. At the solicitation of Elizabeth and the French king, Morton had been pardoned and permitted to return ; and in a secret interview between him, Maitland, and Bothwell, the plan of the murder was ananged. Bothwell undertook the chief part ; and his men having obtained access to the cellars of the Kirk-of- Field, undermined the foundation, and placed gunpowder in the cavities"], [192, "[A D. 1567 168 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. which they had formed. According to another account, they depo sited it in the queen's bedchamber, which was immediately under that of the king. While all this had been secretly carrying into effect, Mary continued her attendance upon Darnley : then recon ciliation appeared to be perfect. She often slept in the house, and, on the evening of the 9th of February, when she took leave of him to attend a marriage of one of her servants, which was to be held at the palace, it was remarked that she embraced him tenderly, took a ring from her finger and placed it on his. On that night, after she i . _ I had retired to her chamber in the palace, a sudden and ter- I ' * rific explosion was heard, which shook the city, and it was 1 56' \u2022 I soon discovered that the Kirk-of- Field was blown up. The dead bodies of the king and his page were found at a little distance in the garden. 20. Scarcely were the citizens of the capital recovered from the horror and dismay occasioned by such a calamity, when bills ap peared on the walls of the Tolbooth, which accused Bothwell of the murder, and added that the queen had assented to it. Soon after wards, the Earl of Lennox, the unhappy father of the late king, earnestly required the imprisonment of the persons named in the anonymous hand-bills, and Bothwell declaring his innocence, de manded an instant trial. It was granted, and Lennox received due notice of it ; but, on the day of trial, Bothwell appeared surrounded by upwards of four thousand of his friends and adherents ; and Len nox, intimidated by the array, or finding it impossible to collect sufficient proof, requested an adjournment. This, however, was peremptorily refused, and the accused was acquitted by the jury. 21. Soon after this acquittal, the parliament assembled, and the majority of the nobility prevailed upon the queen to consent to an act by which all the grants of crown property were confirmed, and herself and her successors deprived of all power of revocation. In the same assembly of the estates, the verdict passed upon Bothwell, which many accused as informal, was declared just and legal, and soon afterwards a bond was drawn up by twenty-four of the prin cipal peers. It affirmed, in solemn terms, the innocence of this profligate baron, whom the public clamour still denounced as the murderer of the king ; recommended him as a proper husband for the queen ; and bound its authors, as they should answer to God, to defend him from all danger, and to promote this unhallowed mar riage to the utmost of their power and ability. The tragedy now hunied on to its conclusion. Bothwell, at the head of a thousand men, intercepted the queen on her way from Stirling to Edinburgh, and carried her, with the slender suite by whom she was accom panied, to Dunbar castle. Here he proposed maniage, and, to ob-"], [193, "A.D. 1567.] 169 MAKY. tain her consent, exhibited the bond signed by her nobles. After a few days he conducted her back to Edinburgh, and raised an action of divorce from his wife ; and the process having been hurried through the court, and sentence passed, Bothwell was manied to the queen at Holyrood, within a month after the murder of her husband (May 15, 1567). 22. Events of the deepest and most tragic interest now crowded on each other. The nobles who had advised the marriage, who had acquitted Bothwell, and abetted him in his career of ambition and outrage, at once dropped the mask, assembled their forces, and de clared their determination to separate the queen from the murderer of her husband. As they advanced and occupied Edinburgh, the earl and the queen retired ; but in a few days they found themselves strong enough to confront their enemies on Carbeny hill near Mus selburgh. Both factions, however, seemed anxious to avoid a battle, and an extraordinary agreement took place. Bothwell, whom they had declared their determination to seize and punish as the murderer of his sovereign, was permitted, without molestation, to ride off the field. The queen was assured of their unshaken fidelity ; and so completely did she credit their asseverations, that she gave her hand to Grange, and suffering him to lead her to his associates, was con ducted by them to the capital. 23. Within an hour she discovered that she had surrendered her self to her mortal enemies. On her entering the city, a furious mob assailed her with execrations, and displayed before her a broad banner, bearing the figure of her murdered husband. Amidst these indignities she was carried to a house, where she was so strictly guarded, that not even her maids were allowed access. On the succeeding evening she was conveyed, by the Lords Lindsay and Ruthven, a prisoner to Lochleven, a strong castle in the middle of a lake, from which all escape seemed hopeless. 24. From those who had thus shamelessly broken their solemn engagement, little else could be looked for but additional indignity and outrage. Mary was soon visited in her prison by Lord Lind say of the Byres, whose fierce temper and brutal manners peculiarly fitted him for the mission on which he was sent. He presented to her three written instruments. By the first she was made to resign the crown in favour of her son ; by the second, the Earl of Moray was nominated regent during the king's minority ; by the third, a temporary regency was appointed to act until Moray returned from the continent. When Lindsay threw these deeds on the table, he plainly informed the queen that no alternative was left, but either to sign them without delay, or prepare for death, as the murderei of H"], [194, "[A. D. 156a 170 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. her husband. We are not to wonder that, aware that her life was in the hands of her bitterest enemies, Mary instantly obeyed. 25. The young king was now crowned ; and Moray having ar rived from France, assumed the regency, and entered upon the cares of government. He had not been many months, however, in pos session of power, when the queen, by the assistance and ingenuity i of a youth of sixteen, named Douglas, escaped in the night I \" ' from Lochleven, and riding first to Niddry, and next day 1 to Hamilton, soon found herself surrounded by a band of her nobles, and at the head of six thousand men. Mary was desir ous to avoid war, and addressed repeated pacific proposals to the regent, who was then at Glasgow. She offered to call a free par liament ; and she declared that she was ready to deliver np to jus tice all whom he accused as guilty of the murder, provided those whom she arraigned of the same crime were also delivered up. But her proposals were peremptorily refused, her messengers were ar rested, and her adherents denounced as traitors ; and the queen, aware that it must come to the decision of the sword, determined to await the arrival of additional forces, when she was hurried into an engagement with the regent, who threw himself in her way at Lang side, as she was on her march from Hamilton to Dunbarton. The result was calamitous. Her army was completely defeated, and, being compelled to flee from the field with a slender train, she rode to Dundrennan, a distance of sixty miles, before she drew bridle. Next day she intimated her resolution of throwing herself on the protection of Elizabeth. From this step her friends earnestly dis suaded her; but she declared she would trust to the assurances which she had received from her good sister ; and, crossing the Sol way, she proceeded through Cockermouth to Carlisle. The return for this act of generous confidence and devotedness is well known. Elizabeth refused to see her, gave orders that she should be detain ed, kept her in prison a miserable and heart-broken captive for nine teen years, and at last brought her to the scaffold."], [195, "SIGN WITHOUT DELAY, OR PREPARE FOR DEATH."], [196, ""], [197, "171 CHAPTER XVH.

The imprisonment of Mary left Moray the undisturbed pos sessor of the supreme power in Scotland ; but the queen strenuous ly and indignantly asserted her innocence of the atrocious crimes of which she was accused ; and as Elizabeth could bring forward no possible justification of her conduct in detaining Mary, except her alleged accession to the murder, it was evident that an investigation of the circumstances, if demanded by the accused party, could not in justice be refused. Mary offered to hear the accusation of her enemies and to undertake her defence in the presence of Elizabeth ; but this was denied her. It was then proposed by the English ministers that she should consent to a public trial ; but this she rejected, as beneath the dignity of an independent sovereign. It was lastly suggested that her enemies should be summoned to produce their proofs before certain English and Scottish commissioners, and that the cause should be left to their decision. 2. A commission was accordingly held at Tork, but it led to po litical intrigues rather than judicial investigation. After some in terval Moray was summoned to hold a private interview with Eli zabeth at Westminster ; and Mary again demanded to be admitted to the same presence, and confronted with her accuser. This was denied, while the English queen permitted Moray to bring forward his charge, and to attempt to substantiate it by letters, affirmed to be in the queen's handwriting, addressed to Bothwell, and conclusive,"], [198, "[A. D. 1568. 172 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. as he contended, of her guilt. Again Mary demanded by her com missioners to be heard personally in her defence ; and this being refused, they protested against further proceedings, and declared the conference at an end Cecil, however, insisted that the inquiry should proceed ; and having procured all the evidence which he judged necessary, he attempted to persuade the Scottish queen, as the only way of avoiding an ignominious exposure, to resign her crown. Her reply disconcerted him. \" They have accused me,\" said she, \" of the murder of my husband. It is a calumnious false hood. It was themselves that counselled and contrived the murder ; some of them were even its executioners. Give me what I am justly entitled to, copies of the letters they have produced ; let me see and examine the originals, and I pledge myself to convict them, in presence of the queen, of the atrocious crime they have had the audacity to impute to me.\" This bold and unexpected tone embar rassed Elizabeth ; and Mary having repeated her charge, insisted on having copies of the letters produced against her. The English queen evaded the request, and advised her to resign the crown. To this she declared that no persuasion would ever induce her ; and under such circumstances the conferences were abruptly terminated. Moray, with his associates, received permission to return to Scot land. He carried away with him the alleged original letters, which the party whom they inculpated was never permitted to examine -, and he left behind him copies, which were also concealed from Mary and her commissioners. It is from these copies, which the accused was never permitted to compare with the originals, that future authors have been obliged to infer the guilt or innocence of the queen ; and certainly, if the opinion of Elizabeth is entitled to weight, it is clear that she considered the proof as defective. She and Moray shrank from a public challenge of Mary ; and, however suspicious or inexplicable some of the steps taken by this unfortu nate princess may have been, her friends alleged that, in the con ferences at York and Westminster, victory was on her side. Yet was she detained a captive by the very princess who had virtually declared her guiltless. All this might, however, have been antici pated ; and no one who knew any thing of the unscrupulous policy of Elizabeth could have dreamed, that having once obtained posses sion of the queen, she would ever permit her to return to her domi nions. In her detention, she possessed the means of rendering Moray subservient to her wishes, of checking the Roman Catholic party, confirming the ascendancy of the Protestants, and destroying the French interest and intrigues in Scotland. These were advan tages with which no considerations of the individual guilt or inno cence of her royal captive were likely to interfere."], [199, "A. D. 1570.] 173 JAMES VI. 3. The subsequent career of Moray was bold and brief. He found himself called to a contest with a party, headed by the Duke of Norfolk in England, and by Maitland and Grange in Scotland, whose object was, the restoration of the Scottish qneen, and her marriage to the Duke of Norfolk. The project had been encouraged by the regent, whether at first sincerely or for selfish and ambi tious purposes, is not clear ; but in the end he betrayed the plot to Elizabeth. 4. The principles upon which Moray's government was conducted were entirely Protestant and English ; and Elizabeth, who knew well and justly valued so able an assistant, cordially co-operated with him to overwhelm the queen's friends, and to destroy all hopes of the Roman Catholic party in either country. But the task was more difficult than had been anticipated. She succeeded, indeed, in extinguishing the great rebellion, led by the Earls of Westmoreland and Northumberland ; but Moray found it impossible to prevent the intrigues of such men as Maitland, Grange, and their associates, who had known him long, and, having assisted to raise him to the supreme power, were indignant to find themselves treated with severity or neglect. It was in the midst of this straggle between the regent and his former associates in ambition, that he was I , \u201e assassinated in the streets of Linlithgow, by Hamilton of I ' ' Bothwellhaugh, who was incited to this act of revenge by I ia'\"- I a private injury, of which Moray was only the remote cause. 5. His death found Scotland divided between two parties. On the one side were the Protestants, who adhered to the young king, and regarded Elizabeth as their protector ; on the other were the queen's friends, who, being animated with the utmost rancour against their opponents, prepared instantly to appeal to the sword. Previously to this, however, they assembled a parliament at Edin burgh, and fulminated denunciations of treason against their ene mies ; while the Protestants in their turn, having chosen the Earl of Lennox regent, convoked the estates at Stirling, and soon after wards having made themselves masters of Dumbarton by a success ful night attack, took prisoner Hamilton the Archbishop of St An drews, who had shut himself up in that fortress. Being instantly brought to trial for his share in the murder of Darnley and of the Regent Moray, he was condemned, hanged, and quartered. This outrage led to retaliation, and a civil war, remarkable for its fero city, began to spread havoc through the country. On Mary's side were the Duke of Chastelherault, the Earls of Argyle, Athole, Huntly, Crawford, Rothes, and Cassillis, the Lords Seton, Boyd, Gray, Livingston, Fleming, with the Lairds of Buccleuch, Ferni-"], [200, "[A. D. 1570. 174 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. herst, and many others; to whom must be added the able and crafty secretary Maitland, and the experienced soldier Kirkaldy of Grange. Of the king's party the nobles were neither so numerous nor so powerful. Lennox, Morton, Mar, and Glencairn, Lords Lindsay, Glammis, Semple, Methven, Ochiltree, Cathcart, Ruthven, and some others, espoused this side ; but if inferior in numbers, they were confident in the assistance of England, and in the support of the church, the commons, and the boroughs. 6. Such was the general comparative strength of each faction. The contest, however, had lasted but a short time, when Lennox was slain in a skirmish at Stirling, and the Earl of Mar, one of the most upright-minded and honourable noblemen in Scotland, was chosen to supply the vacant regency. To promote a reconciliation between the two factions, and to restore peace, order, and security of property, to a countiy distracted by intestine war, were the pur poses to which the new governor devoted himself; but he was thwarted by the ambition of Morton and many of the higher nobles. These had so long been accustomed to derive individual advantage from public misery, that they laboured as earnestly to increase the contentions of the two parties, as Mar to remove them ; and .the governor, at last worn out by the straggle, and hopeless of effecting a reconciliation, sank into the grave. 7. He was succeeded in the regency by the Earl of Morton, \u2014 a man who has been justly described as possessing all the faults, some of the talents, but none of the good qualities of the Regent Moray, of whom he was an old and tried ally. Sordid and selfish, implicitly devoted to the service of Elizabeth, whose countenance and support he felt necessary to enable him to retain his power, a venal judge, a cruel unrelenting soldier, a hypocrite in religion, and a profligate in private life, \u2014 it is difficult to find a single virtue to relieve the dark monotony of his vices. Yet Morton had some of the great qualities which distinguished the house of Douglas. He was brave, decisive, politic ; and he possessed that rapid power of discerning the instant to act with success, and that deep insight into human character, which are commonly acquired by men of talent, bred up in scenes of civil commotion. On the day on which Morton was chosen regent (24th November 1572), the celebrated reformer, John Knox, closed his laborious and honourable career, in the sixty seventh year of his age. His bodily frame, which had at no period been a strong one, was completely worn out by the incessant war fare, theological and political, in which his life had been spent. The regent pronounced over his grave the brief, but forcible and just eulogium, \" There lies one who never feared the face of man.\" 8. On his accession to the supreme power, the regent found the"], [201, "A. D. 1578.] 175 JAMES VI. friends of the imprisoned queen still able to make head against him. The Duke of Norfolk, who had been pardoned by Elizabeth, resumed his project of marrying Mary, and engaged in a correspon dence with her. The Duke of Chastelherault, and the Earl of Huntly, Lord Claud Hamilton, the Lands of Buccleuch and Fer niherst, with the indefatigable Maitland, and Grange, who was reputed the best soldier in Scotland, still supported her cause. Morton, however, strong in his own resources, and supported by Elizabeth, continued the war with success, and at last triumphed over all opposition. Norfolk was brought to the scaffold, and the Earl of Northumberland, treacherously delivered up by the Scot tish regent, shared a similar fate. At last the castle of Edin burgh was invested by Sir William Drury, who joined the Scottish army with a formidable battering train. In this fortress, the only remaining hope of the Queen of Scots, Kirkaldy of Grange com- . -p. I manded ; and he held it bravely till the walls were de- ' stroyed, the guns silenced, and his provisions exhausted. I Under these circumstances he surrendered, with his com panion Maitland. To this step Drury had induced him by a pro mise of favourable terms ; but the English queen disregarded the stipulation, and handed over the prisoners to Morton. Kirkaldy and his brother were immediately executed, and Maitland only escaped the same fate by dying in prison, in consequence, as was reported by his enemies, of having taken poison. 9. Morton now deemed himself so strong as to be independent of . p. all parties, and his avarice and spoliations knew no bounds. . '.-, He oppressed the church, of which he had formerly affect- ed to be the patron, and treated the young king and the nobles with so much haughtiness and severity, that he soon Li became an object of universal dread and hatred. James was now twelve years of age ; and it was not difficult for a faction of the nobles, who detested the regent, to persuade the young monarch that he ought no longer to be treated as a child. Acting by their advice, he accordingly summoned a parliament. It was numerously attended ; and Morton, to the astonishment of all, the moment he learned the king's wishes, declared his willingness to . \u201e I cany them into effect, and instantly resigned the regency. This ready and implicit submission was rewarded by the passing of an act of indemnity, which included a general pardon for any alleged transgressions, and ratified his whole con duct as regent. It is in his anxiety to procure this act, that we are to find the secret of Morton's sudden relinquishment of the supreme power ; and scarcely was it procured, when, by means of a success ful intrigue with a portion of the family of Mar, he found means"], [202, "[A. D. 1581. 176 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. again to become master of the king's person, and re-emerged into as great power and ascendancy as before. His usurpation, how ever, was this time of shorter duration. Athole, Argyle, and some of the most powerful nobles, assembled their forces, and declared their resolution to liberate the sovereign from his ignominious cap tivity. Instead of a battle, however, the opposite factions came to a compromise, by which the veteran tyrant was shorn of a large part of his power, and the young king recovered something of his independence. 10. James began now to shew that strong propensity to favour itism, which marked his future career ; and the effects of this weak ness were seen in the sudden rise into power of Esme Stewart, Duke of Lennox, and Captain Stewart, second son of Lord Ochil tree. Of these, the first was a high-born nobleman, of graceful address, amiable feelings, and common-place understanding; bnt the second, of birth and connections much inferior to Lennox, was ambitious, intriguing, daring, and unprincipled; and soon ma ~T~t) ' naged to gain an influence over both the young king and 1 . \" the duke his favourite. With these advantages, an over- !_ whelming opposition was soon raised against Morton ; and as his exactions and cruelty had made him universally odious, it was in vain that his steady friend, the English queen, interposed to save him. Her interference, indeed, rather accelerated his fate; aud the news that she meditated an invasion, roused the spirit of the young king and of his people to instant opposition. When Elizabeth, however, received intelligence that a Scottish army was assembled, she prudently withdrew from the contest ; and Morton, abandoned to his fate, was, at the instance of Captain Stewart, who had recently been created Earl of Arran, arraigned as an ac complice in the murder of Darnley. His trial was conducted, even in those days of prostituted justice, with a reckless disregard of every form of law; and all were aware that the jury, of whom many were his bitter enemies, would, under any circumstances, | . jj have found him guilty. Of his guilt, however, there can I ' ' be little doubt ; and he himself, after the jury had brought i 1 in their verdict, and sentence of death had been pronounced upon him, acknowledged that he was privy to the intended murder, though he denied that he had either been accessory, or given his consent to it. He died, as he had lived, boldly, expressing a calm contempt of death, and exhibiting all the outward marks of repent ance. 11. The death of Morton was followed by the nominal accession of the young king to the supreme power, but by the actual trans mission of that power into the hands of his favourites, Lennox and"], [203, "A. D. 1583.] 177 JAMES VI. .Arran. The latter nobleman, owing to the weak and flexible cha racter of Lennox, soon came to rale all ; and his rapacity, profli gacy, and open defiance of public opinion, completely disgusted the nation. The result was a conspiracy for his ruin, headed by the Earl of Gowrie. This nobleman and his associates having con trived to make themselves masters of the king's person at the castle of Ruthven, and having removed Lennox and Arran from all autho- T -p. rity in the state, directed the government as they judged . ' ' best for their own interests. But the character of the L king, although full of many strange contradictions, began now to exhibit a greater degree of talent and energy than his op ponents had expected ; and although compelled to dissemble, and shewing no symptoms of discontent with this change of masters, James was really disgusted with the durance in which he was held by Gowrie and his faction. With an ability which proved the more successful, because his adversaries were unprepared for it, he con trived to organize a party, and free himself from his servitude ; but I . y. I it happened unfortunately, that at this crisis the Earl of I ' ' Arran regained his liberty, and, returning to court, soon resumed his baneful influence over the facile monarch. It was by his advice that the king, who had first been inclined to use his victory over the faction of Gowrie with moderation, exchanged this wise resolution for vindictive measures ; and although Eliza beth strongly remonstrated against it, he brought Gowrie to the scaffold, and drove his associates into banishment. 12. Arran was now supremely powerful ; but the venality, ty ranny, and abuses of his government, soon became intolerable, and wrought their own cure by producing a counter-revolution, in which the despotic favourite, after having first courted, and then quar relled with the Scottish church, in vain attempted to recover his in fluence by means of the English queen, and was at last chased from court by the associated lords, who made themselves masters of the king's person. A government, upon a model which admitted the principal nobility to a share in the councils of the state, was now established ; and Arran, deserted by all parties, sank into insigni ficance. 13. It was impossible that Mary, who had been detained a cap tive by Elizabeth, contrary to every principle of honour and justice, should not have exerted herself to regain her freedom ; and the Ro man Catholic party in England were not only interested in her suc cess, but regarded her as their best secunty against Elizabeth and the Protestant faith. This led to a succession of intrigues, which were discovered by the penetration and activity of Elizabeth's mi nisters, \u2014 the discovery only serving to increase the rigour of Mary's"], [204, "[A. D. 1587. 178 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. confinement. In 1572, the English envoy, in a personal interview with Elizabeth and her two ministers, Leicester and Burleigh, was instructed to enter into negotiation with the Regent Mar and the Earl of Morton, to have Mary delivered up to her Scottish subjects, in order that she might be immediately put to death. This atro cious scheme was accordingly communicated to Mar and Morton, who at first entertained it coldly, from a selfish wish of making the most profit of this infamous and cruel bargain ; but afterwards en tered into it with the utmost alacrity. The negotiations were at that time broken off by the death of the Regent Mar. Two years later, however, they were renewed with Morton. But the avarice of the Scottish regent, who insisted on an advance of money, and pensions to his friends, as the reward of his services, and the parsi mony of Elizabeth, who deemed his demands exorbitant, caused this base and cold-blooded plot to be ultimately laid aside. At last, the Scottish queen, having been accused (unjustly, as afterwards ap peared) of an accession to the conspiracy of Babington, the object of which was the assassination of Elizabeth, and the restoration of the ancient religion, was brought to trial before a commission, whose jurisdiction she, as an independent and sovereign princess, at first peremptorily declined. It was unfortunate for Mary that she did not adhere to this resolution ; but under the idea that a refusal might be construed into an admission of guilt, she at last conde scended to plead. The consequence was what might have been ex pected from the nature of the evidence, the constitution of the court, I a p. I and the supreme authority of Elizabeth. Maiy was found I - ' ' guilty of having compassed divers matters tending to the I 1 death of the queen ; and, after many affected delays, and an atrocious attempt to induce her keeper, Paulet, to dispatch her secretly, Elizabeth signed the warrant for her execution, which was canied into effect on the 7th of February 1587. The meekness with which she received the intimation of her sentence, and the for titude with which she suffered, formed a striking contrast to the de spair and agony which not long afterwards darkened the death-bed of the English queen. 14. It might have been expected that if any thing could have roused the king of Scots, it would have been the cruelty and injus tice to which his mother had fallen a sacrifice ; and for a moment there was an ebullition of indignant feeling. But Elizabeth sent him an artful apology. The blame of the execution was laid upon Davison, her secretary, an innocent and upright man, who simply obeyed her orders ; and with that unscrupulous falsehood which this princess seldom hesitated to employ when necessary to cany through her designs, the unfortunate statesman was sacrificed, that"], [205, "A.D. 1589.] JAMES VI. 179 his royal mistress might escape. But the English queen had still a firmer hold over the young king of Scots. He regarded the suc cession to her throne as his undoubted right, and dreaded to irri tate her personal feelings, or alienate her Protestant subjects, by appearing to place himself at the head of the Roman Catholic party, who burned to avenge the death of then royal mistress. In vain, therefore, they looked to the young king, who, after a short inter val, relapsed into his usual pacific frame of mind. 15. James celebrated his entrance upon majority by an attempt I j) to abolish those sanguinary feuds amongst his nobility, i JE07 which had increased to an alarming height, and threatened I L to pull the countiy to pieces. This laudable endeavour, which did not meet with the success it merited, was followed by his 7 -p, maniage to the Princess Anne of Denmark ; an alliance I ' . ' which Elizabeth, with her usual jealous and capricious po 1 L licy, endeavoured to prevent. But the Scottish king, with unwonted spirit and energy, sought his bride in person at her fa ther's court, and having solemnized his marriage at Upslo, returned with her to Scotland. 16. During his absence, the kingdom had been unusually pro sperous and happy ; but it was soon afterwards embroiled by the intrigues and ambition of Francis Stewart, the new Earl of Both well, who, leaguing with the Roman Catholic faction, attacked the palace of Holyrood, with the design of seizing the king's person, and placing himself at the head of the government. A second at tempt of the same kind at Falkland was not more successful ; and yet such was at this time the impotent state of the law, and the weakness of the royal authority, that these repeated treasons es caped unpunished, and Bothwell lived not only to defend, but to repeat them. 17. Scotland at this moment presented a melancholy picture. The intrigues of Philip the Second had encouraged the Roman Ca tholic faction, which was led by the Earls of Huntly, EitoI, and Angus ; and James, aware of the great power possessed by the Romanists, both in Scotland and England, was fearful of treating them with severity, lest he should raise a formidable opposition to his right of succession on the death of Elizabeth. But this was not the only source of disquiet. The excessive lenity of the king had fostered the feudal quan-els among his nobles, impunity led to new excesses, and the turbulent and audacious Bothwell once more appeared upon the scene, and made repeated attempts to seize the royal person, and administer the government at his pleasure. .To these sources of disquiet were added the interference of Elizabeth, which roused the jealousy of the king, and the intolerant spirit of"], [206, "[A. D. 1600. 180 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND- the Protestant ministers, who, horror-struck by the discovery of the intrigues of the Roman Catholic lords, recommended their being treated with the utmost severity. 18. These combined causes transformed the kingdom into a scene of almost perpetual tumult and bloodshed : but the monarch at last becoming convinced of the treasonable purposes of the Popish earls, assembled an army, and reduced them to the last extremity of dis tress. Bothwell, too, was driven into exile, and the countiy began to breathe anew, when James found himself involved in a contest with the Protestant ministers. The cause of this dispute was the king's wish to lean to the side of mercy in his conduct to the Popish lords. It was reported that Huntly, their leader, had been ad mitted to a secret interview. The clergy, alarmed to the utmost, appealed to their congregations ; they defended the conduct of Black, a minister who had openly attacked the court and the queen, in a seditious harangue ; they haughtily declined the authority of the privy council ; and by their violence they excited a tumult in Edinburgh, which compelled the monarch to retire to Linlithgow. Under these trying circumstances, James acted -with extraordinary energy, and, jealous of so bold an interference with his prerogative, restored tranquillity to the capital, punished the insurgent citizens, compelled the ministers to flee to England, and, according to his original intentions, extended his forgiveness to the Popish lords who made a recantation of their errors. 19. James, who had been alarmed at the late violence exhibited by the Presbyterian clergy, now became intent upon a plan for new modelling the church ; but aware that, if the measure originated in any other quarter than among the clergy themselves, it would inevitably miscarry, he artfully prevailed on the General Assembly I . tj to second his views. The commission appointed by this isinn ecclesiastical council were induced to complain that the I L church was the only body not represented in the meeting of the estates ; and the king, whose object it was to restore Epis copacy, procured an act to be passed, by which those ministers upon whom he had conferred the vacant bishoprics and abbeys were entitled to sit in parliament. When this measure came again to be debated in the General Assembly, it encountered great opposi tion. \" Deck these intruders as you will,\" exclaimed one of the most zealous Presbyterians, \" under all their disguise I see the horns of the mitre.\" Yet, after a long debate, a majority of the General Assembly declared in favour of the proposal ; and it was resolved that ministers might lawfully accept a seat in parliament, and that fifty-one members should be chosen as representatives of the church in the supreme court of the countiy. When, however."], [207, "A. 1). 1600.] 181 JAMES VI. the question arose regarding the spiritual jurisdiction which should belong to these persons, the General Assembly so effectually shackled and abridged their powers, that they remained wholly de pendent upon this great ecclesiastical council, and exercised no se parate spiritual jurisdiction. It was James's hope, that, in the course of time, they would shake off these fetters; but, in the mean time, they could claim none of the privileges belonging to the Epis copal order. 20. When the monarch was thus employed, and his kingdom was enjoying a degree of tranquillity to which it had long been a stranger, the minds of the people were unexpectedly agitated by a sudden and mysterious attempt made at Perth upon the Use of the king by the Earl of Gowrie and his brother Alexander Ruthven. These young men were the sons of that Earl of Gowrie who had been executed for treason, and it is probable that a desire to re venge their father's death led to this miserable and ill-concerted enterprise ; but much obscurity hangs over the whole transaction. It is certain that Ruthven induced the king, by a feigned story, to accompany him, with a slender train, from Falkland to his brother's house at Perth. Here he contrived to separate James from his at tendants, and, leading him to a remote apartment, threw himself upon him, seized him by the throat, and drew his dagger. The king straggled to get to the window, and, calling out Treason, alarmed his nobles, who rushed into the room, stabbed Ruthven to the heart, and when Gowrie attempted a rescue, put him also to death on the spot. Both these unfortunate men being slain, the utmost pains were taken to detect their associates, to unravel the plot, and to ascertain their precise object. These investigations met with little success at the time ; but many years after, some letters of the conspirators were discovered, which have thrown considerable light on thi3 strange transaction. From these documents, it appears that it was the intention of Gowrie and his brother to decoy the king into his mansion at Perth, to separate him from his attendants, and to force him on board a boat, which should be in readiness for that purpose. The vessel was then instantly to put out to sea, and convey the royal prisoner to the impregnable fortress of Fastcastle, near St Abb's Head, the residence of Gowrie's accomplice Logan, where the conspirators expected to be able to maintain themselves till they received aid from England, to enable them to administer the government in the king's name, but according to their own pleasure. 21. The queen of England, now in her seventieth year, began soon after this to droop, and her constitution, hitherto vigorous and unimpaired, was evidently breaking up. Of all this James was"], [208, "182 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND well aware. He had secured the friendship and good offices of Sir Robert Cecil, her chief minister, who, unknown to his mistress, canied on a secret con-espondence with the Scottish king; and, acting by his advice, he had employed every effort to conciliate the affections of the English people, and to acquire the support of the most powerful of the English nobility. These judicious precautions were attended with the wished-for result. James was Elizabeth's undoubted hen ; and on the death of this princess, an event which took place on the 23d of March 1603, he succeeded, with the una nimous consent of the nation, to the throne of England. This great and auspicious event closes the history of Scotland as a separate kingdom. CHAPTER XVHI. Manners and Customs of the People. 1. During the period that elapsed between the accession of the House of Stewart and the union of the crowns, Scotland had by no means kept pace in prosperity with her wealthier neighbour. The civil commotions and intestine feuds which existed among a popu lation composed of different races, and often animated by hostile interests, and especially the straggle which, for centuries, the Scots had been compelled to carry on against the ambition of the English monarchs, had necessarily retarded the progress of the nation in wealth and refinement. But, above all, the public welfare had been fatally injured by the unprincipled conduct of a factious and selfish aristocracy. \u2022Their sanguinary feuds, often arising from trifling quarrels, depopulated whole districts and counties ; while their right of private war, the ties of manrent, and the abuses of their baronial jurisdictions, were the constant sources of misery and strife among all classes of the community. Feudal hatred and re venge deluged the country with blood, and even the sovereign him self was not secure from these atrocities. As the great baronial chiefs were on all occasions accompanied by bands of armed fol lowers, bloody encounters were constantly taking place whenever those who held each other at feud happened to meet ; and to such an extent did this ferocious spirit prevail, that quarrels and blood shed were not unfrequently witnessed among them even on their way to church on the Sabbath ; and the churchyard and the veiy porch of the sacred edifice were often polluted by their murders."], [209, "MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE PEOPLE. 183 Nor was this all ; these proud barons had no scruples in employing assassination for the purpose of removing an obnoxious rival ; and to such an extent did this foul practice prevail, especially during the reign of Mary and the minority of James, that the country be came, on account of it, \" a byword and a reproach\" among foreign nations. 2. One great cause of the rudeness and backwardness of the country at this period was the want of an influential middle class to fill up the space in society between the lord and the serf. The Scottish tenantry were maintained rather for the purpose of swelling the retinue, and augmenting the power of the barons, than with a view to increase the fertility of the soil. They were entirely de pendant on their landlords ; and as they rented their farms, for the most part, from year to year, and might at any moment be ejected at the pleasure of their feudal superiors, they had no encouragement to devote themselves to the improvement of the soil. Ejections did indeed not unfrequently happen ; and, as might have been ex pected in such a state of society, the assassination of the intruder by those whom he had dispossessed, was an event of common oc currence. 3. While ignorance and barbarism were thus prevalent, we need not wonder that all classes of the community, even the highest, were characterised by rudeness of demeanour. The clergy them selves, who greatly excelled the barons in literary attainments, were yet liable to the same censure. It is mentioned by Knox, that on one occasion at Glasgow, Archbishop Dunbar and Cardinal Beaton had a furious quarrel respecting their right of precedence in a pro cession to the Cathedral. \" After many hot and foul words, the controversy grew so fierce, that a battle commenced between the followers of the two dignitaries even in the chinch porch ; heads were broken, beards torn out by handfuls, and copes and tippets rent to shreds, while crosses and cross bearers were thrown to the ground, and trampled under foot.\" 4. The morality of the upper classes was on a level with their refinement and courtesy. Previous to the Reformation, the immo rality of the clergy was openly and unblushingly displayed. The courts of James IV., James V., and Mary, were notorious for their profligacy and sensuality ; and the writings of the Scottish poets during the period referred to, furnish abundant evidence of the pre valence of a similar laxity of morals among all classes of the com munity. 5. Among the nobles and knights, tournaments were celebrated with great splendour, especially during the reigns of James IV. and his son, and were attended by knights from every part of Europe."], [210, "184 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Hunting and hawking continued to be favourite pursuits of the higher classes. For the common people, weaponshaws were held regularly several times a-year ; and at these meetings, leaping, run ning, wrestling, quoits, shooting at the papingo, and archery, were the active games commonly practised. Tennis, hand and foot-ball, and golf, were among the out-door games. Dancing was a favour ite recreation ; and cards, dice, chess, draughts, and backgammon, served also to beguile the tedium of their in-door life. 6. About the close of the sixteenth century, the example of their English neighbours began to exercise a beneficial influence on the Scots, and to soften the rudeness of their domestic life. Stately mansions occasionally superseded the old gloomy baronial castles. Among the higher nobles, cups of pewter and platters of wood were discarded for services of gilt metal, and even of plate ; and cleanli ness and convenience began to take the place of dirt and domestic discomfort. This improvement, however, was almost entirely con fined to the nobility and clergy ; and even among them was only partial, for we find that the beds of the young nobles still frequent ly consisted of nothing but straw. The huts and hovels of the pea santry remained as before. The houses of the farmers were mean un sightly buildings, consisting only of two apartments ; and the shops of tradesmen and merchants, even in the metropolis, were but mise rable sheds of wood, covered with thatch. 7. A gradual improvement had been taking place with the ex tension of the commerce of the kingdom ; and at this period so many foreign luxuries were imported into the countiy, that various severe laws were enacted for the purpose of suppressing this departure from the rudeness and simplicity of former times. The use of drags, confections, and foreign spiceries, was prohibited to all except pre lates and peers, and persons possessing an annual income of two thousand pounds Scots. In the establishments of the great barons, all the retainers sat at the same table with their superiors, but their position at table varied according to their rank, and the chief dain ties were reserved for those privileged to sit at the upper end of the board. The menials received a small allowance of animal food, but lived chiefly on corn and vegetables. Great quantities of red colewort and cabbage were used, and salted mutton and geese, but little fresh meat. Porridge was a common article of food, as it still continues to be, among the lower classes in Scotland. A lively idea of the mode of living among the poorer knights and barons is furnished by a writer of that period, who says \u2014 \" Myself was at a knight's house, who had many servants to attend him, that brought in his meat, with the heads covered with blue caps ; the table be ing more than half furnished with great platters of ponidge ; each"], [211, "the pop l M JAY."], [212, ""], [213, "185 MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE PEOPLE. having a little piece of sodden meat ; and when the table was serv ed, the servants did sit down with us ; but the upper mess, instead of porridge, had a pullet with some prunes in the broth. And I observed no art of cooker)', or furniture of household stuff, but ra ther rude neglect of both, though myself and my companion, sent from the governor of Berwick about border affaire, were entertain ed after their best manner.\" Music appears to have been a favour ite accompaniment to dinner. Wine was used in great abund ance, and ale and malmsey were also drank frequently to excess. Among the higher classes, dinner was served at eleven, and supper at six o'clock. The convivial habits of the people manifested them selves with peculiar force at marriages and funerals. Music, songs, dancing, feasting, and drinking, were the indispensable accompani ments of every wedding. Among the poorer classes, it was the custom for each of the guests to contribute towards defraying the expenses of the marriage feast ; and the sum thus subscribed was generally found sufficient to enable the young couple to begin the world with some degree of comfort. After the Reformation, the clergy made a strenuous effort to suppress these \" penny weddings,\" as they were commonly termed, but without effect. The utmost they could do was to limit the contribution of each guest to the mo derate sum of five shillings Scots. 8. The funeral customs of the people closely resembled those which still exist among the Irish. The friends and neighbours of the deceased kept constant watch beside the corpse till the time of interment. This was termed holding the lyke-wake. The mate rials of feasting and drinking were, of course, provided in the great est abundance. On the day of the interment, the whole assembled company were entertained with the same profusion. If the de ceased was a person of rank, the interment was frequently accom panied with the ringing of bells, and discharges of muskets and ar tillery : and after the funeral, the friends and relatives of the family returned to the house \"to drink the dirgie,\" and generally spent the night in festivity and mirthful tumult. This practice, which necessarily led to gross abuses, has been discontinued only within a comparatively recent period. 9. The inhabitants of the Highlands differed widely from the rest of the Scottish population in their manners and customs, and were much more rude and uncivilized. They were under the patriarchal form of government ; their chiefs possessing absolute power over every individual connected with the clan. Their dress, amusements, and occupations presented a marked contrast to those of the Low landers. Plundering and hunting formed their chief employments. They had abundance of all kinds of game ; and, as they sowed no H 2"], [214, "186 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. corn, and despised the unwarlike occupations of husbandry, animal food formed then principal subsistence. 10. The Scottish borders were at this period inhabited by a race totally distinct in their habits from the rest of the community. Living upon the extremities of the kingdom, constantly exposed to the incursions of the English, and ever liable to lose their whole substance by a sudden inroad of their enemies, all their customs and modes of life were necessarily of a peculiar kind, adapted to their singular position. They cared little to lose their time in cultivating crops to be reaped by their foes. Their cattle formed, therefore, their chief property, and, as these were nightly exposed to the ra pacity of the English marauders, who sought their booty on the Scottish border, they regarded robbery as only a fair reprisal. The rapine by which they subsisted was accounted fair and honourable ; and, when disappointed in their attempts to cany off the cattle or goods of their enemies, they did not scruple to extend their depre dations to the more cultivated parts of their own country. They were distinguished for their courage and activity, and for fidelity to their word. Their inroads were never marked with cruelty, and seldom even with bloodshed, unless in cases of opposition. They held that property was common to all who stood in need of it ; but they avoided the crime of unnecessary bloodshed. In cases of deadly feud, however, revenge was deemed a sacred duty, and vengeance was taken for the death of any of their number, not only upon the homicide and his family, but upon all his kindred, and even upon his whole tribe. 11. With regard to government, the border tribes were under the immediate dominion of chiefs, who were held responsible for then conduct, and were obliged to find caution that they would subject themselves to the due course of law. The residence of the chieftain was commonly a large square tower called a keep or peel, situated in a position which was rendered almost inaccessible, by torrents, rocks, or morasses. His revenue was principally derived from his herds of cattle and sheep, from the black-mail which he exacted from his neighbours, and partly also from a share in the spoil which his retainers acquired by rapine. Payment of rent was hardly known on the borders till after the Union. 12. The houses of the common people were small miserable huts, which, on the approach of an English army, they unroofed to pre vent then being burned, and then abandoned them to the foe. Their dress and arms were equally simple ; and, in battle, the chief could scarcely be distinguished from the serf, all wearing the same coat-armour called a jack. Their offensive weapons were a long lance, a sword, a kind of battle-axe called a Jedburgh-staff, and."], [215, "MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE PEOPLE. 187 latterly, dags or pistols. They were accustomed to act on horse back, and formed very superior light cavalry, riding horses of a small size, but remarkably swift, and trained to bound through the morasses with which the borders abounded. With regard to their amusements, the game of foot-ball formed a favourite border sport, and their warlike meetings, previous to any military exploit, were frequently disguised under the pretence of following this amusement. 13. The Reformation was late in penetrating into the border wilds, and the borderers remained attached to the Roman Catholic faith for some time after it was renounced by the rest of Scotland. This, however, in all probability, arose from a total indifference upon the subject ; for at no time were they remarkable for obedience to the mandates of their ecclesiastical superiors. No part of Scotland, however, abounded more in superstitious fears and observances, and nowhere were old legendary stories more firmly believed. 14. The Scottish monarchs made various attempts to quell the banditti on the borders, but their efforts were only partially success ful. James IV. and his successor proceeded against these marau ders with the utmost vigour and severity, and some of the most no torious offenders were unexpectedly surprised in their fastnesses, and instantly hanged over the gates of their own castles. These sanguinary examples of justice were long remembered on the marches, and produced such good effects, that, according to an an cient history, \" thereafter there was great peace and rest a long time, wherethrough the king had great profit ; for he had ten thou sand sheep going in the Ettrick forest, in keeping by Andrew Bell, who made the king as good count of them as they had gone in the bounds of Fife.\" 15. The Regent Moray suppressed with a firm hand the out rages of these border moss-troopers, whom he caused to be hanged or drowned by dozens. But, on the very day of his murder, the Scotts and Kerrs broke into England, and spread devastation along the frontiers with unusual ferocity. On the accession of James VI. to the English crown, the east marches were in a state of compara tive civilization. But, in the middle and western marches, the inhabitants were unrestrained moss-troopers and cattle-drivers, \" knowing no measure of law but the length of their swords.\" The most arbitrary measures were, without hesitation, resorted to for the extirpation of these irreclaimable offenders. Many of them were executed without even the formality of a trial. A band of the most desperate of these warriors was sent to the Continent for the service of the States of Holland ; and the Grahams, a hardy and ferocious race of freebootere, were transported to Ireland, and their return prohibited under pain of death. By these rigorous proceed-"], [216, "[A. D. 1603. 188 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ings, the borders were at length reduced to a state of tranquillity ; though it was not till after the lapse of a considerable period, that the inhabitants of this district were assimilated in their manners and customs to the rest of their countrymen.

James, on his accession to the throne of Great Britain, was veiy desirous that the two kingdoms should be completely incorpo rated. A motion to this effect was made in his first parliament by Sir Francis Bacon, the king's solicitor, who supported it with all the ability and eloquence for which he was so greatly distinguished. It reflects honour on the sagacity which James at intervals displayed, that he was eager in forwarding this measure. But both nations were bitterly hostile to the proposal, and it consequently failed. In the session of 1604, however, commissioners from both countries agreed to the entire abrogation of all hostile laws between the two kingdoms, to the abolition of border courts and customs, and to a free intercourse of trade throughout the king's dominions. And in conformity with an opinion obtained from the judges, the post nati, that is, all Britons born since the death of Queen Elizabeth, were declared to be naturalized subjects in either kingdom. 2. Although James was wholly destitute of religious zeal or fana-"], [217, "A. D. 1617.] JAMES I. 189 ticism, he was resolutely bent on the subversion of the Presbyterian form of church government, and the restoration of Episcopacy in Scotland. The first blow was struck at the General Assembly in 1605. It was arbitrarily prorogued by royal authority, three times in succession. Irritated at these unconstitutional proceedings, a number of the leaders of the church convened a meeting on their own authority at Aberdeen. A prosecution was immediately com menced against thirteen of the members, six of whom were con victed of high treason. After a rigorous confinement, their sen tence of death was commuted into perpetual banishment. 3. Soon after these violent proceedings, in a parliament held at Perth, the bishops were re-established in their authority, honours, and estates. As might have been expected, in no long time they came into collision with the Presbyterian clergy. The famous Andrew Melville, James Melville, his nephew, and six others, were invited to London by the king, for the purpose of holding a free conference about doctrine and discipline. But their return to their own coun try was prohibited. Andrew Melville, for writing a Latin epigram against the ceremonials of Prelacy, was arbitrarily committed to the Tower of London, where he lay for four years, and was only re leased upon condition that he should pass the remainder of his life in some foreign country. His nephew was confined for life to Ber wick ; and the other six ministers were banished to separate and re mote districts in Scotland. 4. In 1606, an ecclesiastical convention, summoned by royal au thority, met at Linlithgow, and made several advances towards the complete abolition of Presbytery, and the restoration of Episcopacy. In 1609, the Consistorial Courts, which, at the Reformation, had been committed to civil judges, were restored to the bishops. In 1610, the king established two courts of High Commission, one at St Andrews, the other at Glasgow. The Archbishops of St Andrews and Glasgow were placed at the head of these tyrannical courts, and power was given them to suspend, deprive, or imprison any of the clergy who disobeyed their orders. 5. A meeting of the General Assembly was convened at Glasgow in June 1610, for the purpose of confirming the authority of the bishops within their respective dioceses ; after which, as the Scot tish prelates had not received Episcopal ordination, three of then number \u2014 Spottiswood, archhishop of Glasgow ; Hamilton, bishop of Galloway ; and Lamb, bishop of Brechin \u2014 were summoned to Lon don, to receive consecration from the hands of the English bishops ; and on their return home, their Scottish brethren received from them the imposition of hands. 6. In 1617, after an absence of fourteen years, James revisited"], [218, "[A.D. 1617. 190 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Scotland, with the design of establishing Episcopacy in that king dom. He did not, however, propose at once to abolish Presbytery entirely, and set up Episcopacy in its room. He meant to content himself, in the meantime, with establishing the royal authority above the ecclesiastical, and introducing some ceremonies into the public worship, such as kneeling at the sacrament, private commu nion, private baptism, confirmation of children, and the like. But as his design was fully seen through from the beginning, every ad vance towards Episcopacy produced the greatest discontent. James aimed at nothing less than the ultimate subversion of the establish ed religion of the countiy ; but the stern Presbyterians of that age would not consent to tolerate a single ceremony bon-owed from Episcopacy. All the efforts of the king served only to envenom the hatred of the people, and to treasure up vengeance against the com ing day of retribution. 7. At this time the power of the Scottish clergy was exceedingly great, and was not always exercised with becoming moderation. Not satisfied with authority in ecclesiastical matters, they assumed a censorial power over every part of the administration. There was something, however, in the spirit and circumstances of the time, which went far to justify this line of conduct. The pulpit was then the only place whence the people could derive instruction, and then sole teachers and guides were the clergy. No public press as yet existed. Books were few and expensive, appearing at distant in tervals, and were wholly inaccessible to the mass of the people. Journals were entirely unknown. In such circumstances, the clergy naturally became the political as well as religious instructors of the people ; the defenders of their civil rights, as well as the guardians of public morals, and of the purity of ecclesiastical discipline. 8. Shortly after the king's arrival in Scotland, a parliament was held, in which a bill was brought forward and passed, for the pur pose of enacting, that, \" in ecclesiastical affairs, whatever should be determined by the king, with the advice of the prelates and a competent number of the clergy, should receive the operation and the force of law.\" But a spirited protest was presented against it by the clergy ; and James, becoming alarmed, caused the bill to be silently withdrawn. After the parliament was dissolved, a great meeting of the clergy was held in St Andrews, where the king caused three distinguished preachers \u2014 Simpson, Ewart, and Calder wood \u2014 who had signed the protest, to be brought before the High Commission Court, and convicted of sedition. Simpson and Ewart were suspended and imprisoned, and Calderwood was banished for life. 9. The king, by virtue of his royal prerogative, commanded the"], [219, "A. D. 1633.: JAMES I. 191 clergy to adopt the following ceremonies of the English church : 1. That the eucharist should be received in a kneeling, and not in a sitting posture. 2. That the sacrament should be administered privately to the sick at their request. 3. That baptism should be administered in private houses, in similar cases. 4. That the bishops should give confirmation to youth. 5. That the festivals of Christ mas, Good Friday, Easter, Ascension-day, and Whitsunday, should be commemorated in Scotland as in England. 10. James was with difficulty persuaded to remit these articles to the consideration of a general assembly of the whole kirk ; and only consented, on the assurance of his ministers that matters should be so managed as to make the assembly submissive to his will. After the king's return to England, an assembly was accordingly convened at Perth, in which a majority was found to sanction the five articles of ceremonies ; and they were afterwards ratified by the parliament which met in 1621. 11. James died of a tertian ague, on the 27th of March 1625, having lived fifty-nine years, and reigned over England twenty-two. He was succeeded by his son Charles I., whose accession to the throne was hailed with joy by the whole nation. Shortly after, he married the Princess Henrietta, daughter of the King of France. The discontent which the Five Articles of Perth had excited in Scot land, both among the clergy and the people, still continued. But the king turned a deaf ear to all complaints regarding these inno vations, and directed the Archbishop of St Andrews to support the form of ecclesiastical government, as by law established. The chan cellorship was bestowed on Spottiswood the primate ; the Bishop of Ross was made treasurer ; and nine of the other prelates were made privy councillors \u2014 arrangements which did not tend to strengthen the royal authority, either among the nobles or the people. 12. It was not till 1633 that Charles visited Scotland \u2014 a delay which caused some complaints, as if the king thought the ancient crown of that country not worth his journey thither. The people, notwithstanding, received him with great demonstrations of joy ; and he was crowned at Edinburgh on the 18th of June 1633. Im mediately after the coronation a parliament was held, which voted supplies with unprecedented liberality and promptitude. An act was brought forward concerning ecclesiastical habits, which met with great opposition. Charles interrupted the deliberations on this sub ject, and haughtily commanded the members not to deliberate, but to vote. The proposed innovations were rejected by a clear majo rity of the house ; but the Lord Register impudently reported them as affirmed by parliament. A scrutiny was demanded but refused"], [220, "[A. D. 1638. 192 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. by the king, who ratified the act, and immediately after dissolved the parliament, and returned to London. 13. During the king's visit to Scotland, Laud was made Arch bishop of Canterbury, and zealously abetted the attempts of Charles to establish uniformity of worship in all parts of the kingdom. The canons for establishing a new ecclesiastical jurisdiction were pro mulgated in 1635 ; and were received without any outward appear ance of opposition, yet with great inward discontent. But when the reading of the liturgy was first attempted, it produced the most violent tumult. A joint-stool was thrown at the bishop's head ; sticks, stones, and dirt followed, with cries of \" Down with the priest of Baal 1\" \" A pope, a pope !\" \" Antichrist !\" The city autho rities with great difficulty cleared the church of the rioters ; and the bishop, on returning to his house after the service, narrowly eseaped with his life. 14. In all parts of the countiy the liturgy excited similar oppo sition. A universal combination against the religious innovations began immediately to take place. But Charles, as if obstinately bent on his own destruction, continued inflexible in his purpose, though he had nothing to oppose to the united force of the kingdom, but a proclamation, in which he pardoned all past offences, and ex horted the people to be more obedient for the future, and to submit peaceably to the use of the liturgy. This proclamation accelerated the insurrection, which had before been but slowly advancing. Four Tables, as they were called, were formed in Edinburgh, one consist ing of nobility, another of gentry, a third of ministers, and a fourth of burgesses. The table of gentry was divided into many subordinate ones, according to the different counties. In the hands of the Four Tables the authority of the whole kingdom was placed. Orders were issued by them, and everywhere obeyed with the utmost re gularity. Among the first acts of their government was the pro duction of the celebrated Covenant, renouncing popery and prelacy. A bond of union or league followed, by which the subscribers ob liged themselves to resist all religious innovations, and to defend each other against all opposition whatsoever. The Covenant was subscribed by people of all ranks and conditions. Few disapproved of it in their hearts, still fewer dared openly to condemn it, and even the king's ministers themselves were mostly of the same way of thinking. 15. The king now began to be seriously alarmed. He sent the Marquis of Hamilton, as commissioner, to treat with the Covenant ers. He required the Covenant to be renounced and cancelled ; and, as sufficient concessions on his part, he offered to suspend the canons and liturgy till they could be received in a fair and legal way,"], [221, "A. D. 1639.] CHARLES I. 193 and so to model the High Commission, that it should no longer give offence to his subjects. In answer to this demand, however, the Covenanters declared, that they would sooner renounce then baptism than the Covenant, and they invited the commissioner himself to sign it. Hamilton returned to London ; made another fruitless jour ney, with new concessions, to Edinburgh ; returned again to Lon don ; and was immediately sent back with still more ample conces sions. The king was now willing to abolish entirely the canons, the liturgy, and the High Commission court. He even offered to limit greatly the power of the bishops, and seemed content, if, on any terms, he could retain that order in the Church of Scotland. He also gave Hamilton authority to summon first an assembly, and then a parliament, where every national grievance should be re dressed. But these tardy and reluctant concessions only shewed the weakness of the king, and encouraged the maleconteiits to rise in their demands. The offer, however, of an assembly and a parlia ment, in which they expected to be entirely masters, was very will ingly embraced by the Covenanters. 16. The assembly met in Glasgow in 1638. A firm resolution had been formed of utterly abolishing Episcopacy ; and as a pre paratory step, there was laid before the presbytery of Edinburgh, and solemnly read in all the churches of the kingdom, an accusation against the bishops as guilty of the foulest crimes. The bishops sent a protest, declining the authority of the assembly. The Mar quis of Hamilton, the commissioner, after the lapse of a few days, also protested against the court as illegally constituted and elected, and, in his Majesty's name, dissolved it. This measure was fore seen, and little regarded. The assembly still continued to sit, and transact business. All the acts of assembly, since the accession of James to the crown of England, were declared null and void. The acts of parliament which affected ecclesiastical affairs, were held as having no authority. And thus the whole fabric which James and Charles, in a long course of years, had been rearing with much care and policy, fell at once to the ground. The Covenant was ordered to be signed by every one, under pain of excommunication. 17. As matters had evidently come to a crisis, the Covenanters || prepared in earnest for war. The Earl of Argyle, though | ' ' he long seemed to temporize, at last embraced the Cove j lb,j9. nant, and became the chief leader of that party, which also numbered among its distinguished adherents the Earl of Rothes, Cassillis, Montrose, and Lothian, the Lords Lindsay, Loudoun, Yester, and Balmerino. Many Scottish officers had acquired repu tation in the German wars, particularly under Gustavus ; and these were invited over to assist their country in its present necessity i"], [222, "194 i.A. D. 1639. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. The command was entrusted to General Leslie, a soldier of expe rience and ability. Forces were regularly enlisted and disciplined. Arms were commissioned and imported from foreign countries. A few castles which belonged to the king, being unprovided with pro visions, ammunition, and garrisons, were soon seized ; and the whole country, except a small part under the Marquis of Huntly, who still adhered to the king, fell into the hands of the Covenanters. 18. Charles, on the other hand, was not deficient in endeavours to appease this formidable combination. A formidable and well supplied fleet, having live thousand men on board, under the com mand of the Marquis of Hamilton, was ordered to sail for the Frith of Forth. An army of nearly twenty thousand foot and three thou sand horse was levied, and placed under the command of the Earl of Arundel. The king himself joined the army, and summoned all the peers of England to attend him. The whole had the appearance of a splendid court rather than a military armament ; and in this state the army anived at Berwick. 19. The Scottish force, which, under General Leslie, was now encamped at Dunse-Law, was equally numerous with that of the king, but inferior in cavalry. The officers had more experience ; and the soldiers, though ill disciplined and armed, were animated both by the national aversion to England, and the dread of becom ing a province of their old rival, and by that religious enthusiasm which was the occasion of the war. Then leaders, however, acted with great prudence, sent very submissive messages to the king, and craved leave to be admitted to a treaty. To this Charles con sented, and concluded a pacification, in which it was stipulated that he should withdraw his fleet and army, \u2014 that within forty-eight horns the Scots should dismiss their forces,\u2014 that the king's forts should be restored to him, his authority acknowledged, and a gene ral assembly and parliament immediately summoned, in order to compose all differences. 20. The peace thus agreed to was not of long duration. Charles could not prevail upon himself to abandon the cause of Episcopacy, and secretly intended to seize every favourable opportunity to re cover the ground he had lost. The assembly, on the other hand, proceeded with the utmost vigour and determination, voting Epis copacy to be unlawful in the Church of Scotland, stigmatizing the canons and liturgy as popish, and denouncing the High Commis sion as tyranny. The parliament which sat after the assembly, ad vanced pretensions which tended to diminish the civil power of the monarch, and was proceeding to ratify the acts of assembly, when, by the king's instructions, it was prorogued by Traquair, the com-"], [223, "L D. 1640 ] CHARLES I. 195 nissioner. In consequence of these claims, which might have easily jeen foreseen, the war recommenced the same year. 21. No sooner had Charles concluded the peace, however, than, rom want of money, he found himself obliged to disband his army ; ind it was impossible to reassemble it, without great trouble, ex pense, and loss of time. The Covenanters, on the contrary, on dismissing their troops, had been careful to order the officers to be ready on the first summons. The soldiers were warned not to think the nation secure from an English invasion ; and the religious zeal which animated all ranks of men, made them immediately fly to their standards, as soon as the trumpet of war was sounded by then leaders. 22. In 1640, however, the king managed to draw an army to gether ; but finding himself unable to support it, he was obliged to call a parliament, after an intermission of about eleven years. But, as the sole object of the king was to obtain a supply of money, while the parliament insisted on a redress of grievances, a dissolution speedily ensued. 23. Disappointed of a supply from the parliament, the king was obliged to have recourse to other expedients ; and, partly by eccle siastical subsidies, partly by forced loans, and other measures of a similar kind, he succeeded in raising a considerable sum, which en abled him to set in motion an army consisting of 19,000 foot and 2U00 horse. The Scottish forces were somewhat superior, and being sooner ready than the king's army, boldly advanced into England. At Newburn, a detachment of 4500 men, under Lord Couway, at tempted to dispute the passage of the river Tyne. But the Scots attacked the detachment with great bravery, killed several, and chased the remainder from the ground. A panic now seized the whole English army. The forces at Newcastle fled immediately to Durham ; and not thinking themselves safe there, they abandoned the town, and retreated into Yorkshire. 24. Charles had by this time arrived at York ; and finding it im possible to prevent the advance of the Scots, he agreed to a treaty, and named sixteen English noblemen to meet with eight Scottish commissioners at Ripon. A cessation of hostilities was agreed to in the mean time, and the negotiations were shortly after transfer red from Ripon to London. 25. The king having promised to pay a visit to his subjects in Scotland, arrived there on the 14th of August 1641. He professed his intention to give full satisfaction to the people of that countiy ; and some useful changes were in reality made. The bench of bishops and the bonds of articles were abolished ; it was provided, that no man should be created a Scottish peer, who did not possess"], [224, "LA. D. 1640. 196 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ten thousand merks (above L.500 sterling) of annual rent in the kingdom ; a law for triennial parliaments was passed ; it was re solved that the last act of every parliament should be to appoint the time and place for holding the parliament next ensuing ; and the king was also deprived of the power he had formerly exercised of issuing proclamations enjoining obedience under the penalty of trea son. But the heaviest blow given to the royal authority, was an article which provided, that no member of the privy council, no of ficer of state, and no judge, should be appointed without the advice and approbation of parliament. Charles even agreed to deprive of their seats four judges who had adhered to his interests ; and then places were supplied by others more agreeable to the ruling party. Several of the Covenanters were also sworn members of the privy council ; and all the ministers of state, judges, and councillors, were, by law, to hold their offices during life or good behaviour. During his stay in Scotland, the king himself conformed to the Presbyterian church. He bestowed pensions and preferments on Henderson, Gillespie, and other popular preachers ; and he practised every arti fice to soften, if not to gain, his most active opponents. The Earl of Argyle was created a marquis, Lord Loudon an earl, and Leslie was raised to the peerage by the title of Lord Leven. But though Charles thus heaped favours on his enemies with a prodigal hand, they were not satisfied, believing that all he did proceeded from ar tifice and necessity, while some of his friends were disgusted, and thought themselves ill-rewarded for their past services. 26. At this period a rebellion broke out in Ireland with circum stances of unparalleled atrocity and bloodshed. Roger More, a gen tleman descended from an ancient Irish family, but of narrow for tune, formed the project of expelling the English, and asserting the independence of his native countiy. For this purpose, he went secretly from chieftain to chieftain, and, by his persuasions, engaged Lord Macguire and Sir Phelim O'Neale, the most powerful of the old Irish chiefs, and a number of the most considerable persons of the nation, in the conspiracy. 27. On the night before the day fixed for the commencement of the insurrection, the plot was made known by the confession of one of the conspirators. This confession saved the capital, but came too late to prevent the insunection in the provinces. O'Neale and his confederates had already taken arms in Ulster, and a universal massacre commenced, accompanied with circumstances of unequalled barbarity. No age, no sex, no condition, was spared. In the frenzy of this bloody tragedy eveiy ordinary tie was broken, and death dealt by the hand from which protection was implored and expected. Enormities were committed which, though attested by"], [225, "A. D. 1643.] 197 CHARLES I. undoubted evidence, appear almost incredible. The dwellings of the English were burned and laid level with the ground, while the miserable owners perished in the flames, together with their wives and children. If anywhere a number assembled together, and re solved to oppose the assassins, they were disarmed by capitulations and promises of safety confirmed by the most solemn oaths ; but no sooner had they surrendered, than the rebels, with perfidy equal to their cruelty, made them share the fate of their unhappy country men. Others tempted their prisoners by the love of life to imbrue their hands in the blood of friends, brothers, or parents, and having thus rendered them accomplices in their own guilt, inflicted on them that death which they sought to shun by deserving it. 28. From Ulster the flames of rebellion spread in an instant over the other three provinces of Ireland. Even in those places where the rebels professed to act with humanity, then tender mercies were cruel. Not content with expelling the English from their houses, they stripped them of their very clothes, and turned them out naked aud defenceless to all the severities of the season, which destroyed what the sword had spared. By some computations, the number of those who perished by all these cruelties, is estimated at one hun dred and fifty thousand ; by the most moderate estimate forty thou sand are calculated to have lost then lives. 29. The English of the Pale, as they were called, or the old Eng lish planters, who were all Catholics, pretended at first to condemn the insurrection. But they ultimately joined the Lish, and rivalled them in acts of cruelty towards the English Protestants. Both the English and Irish rebels pretended authority from the king and queen, but especially the latter, for their insturection ; and they af firmed that the cause of then taking arms was to vindicate the royal prerogative, now invaded by the puritanical parliament. 30. The king received intelligence of this insurrection while in Scotland, and he immediately made application to the Scots for as sistance in the suppression of it. But as his sincerity was doubtful, and as he was even charged with a guilty foreknowledge of what was perpetrated in Ireland, the Scots contented themselves with dispatclung a small body of forces to support the Scottish colonies in Ulster. 31. Shortly after the king's return to England, matters came to a crisis between him and the parliament, and both parties appealed to arms. The campaign of 1643 terminated without any decisive ad vantage to either party ; and the issue of the war being still doubt ful, both the king and the parliament began to look for assistance from other quarters. The former looked to Ireland, the latter to Scotland. Commissioners were accordingly sent to Edinburgh to"], [226, "[A. D. 1644 198 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. treat of a more close confederacy with the Scottish nation. The Solemn League and Covenant was agreed to between the parties, by which they bound themselves to \" endeavour, without respect of persons, the extirpation of popery, prelacy, superstition, heresy, and profaneness ;\" to preserve the reformed religion as established in the Church of Scotland, and to reform the churches of England and Ire land \" according to the Word of God.\" This latter equivocal clause was introduced by the dexterity of Sir Hany Vane, and complete ly blinded the Scottish Presbyterians, who, assuming their own to be the purest church, never doubted that it was intended to serve as a model for England. The Solemn League and Covenant was received by the English parliament and their adherents with great cordiality, and ordered to be universally subscribed in both king doms. By a treaty with the Commissioners, twentj'-one thousand Scottish troops were to be retained in arms at the expense of Eng land, to be led by their own generals, and to receive orders from a committee of both kingdoms. 32. In the month of July 1643, the famous Assembly of Divines met at Westminster, for the purpose of settling the government and form of worship of the Church of England. The assembly consisted of one hundred and twenty-one clergymen. Ten members of the House of Lords, and twenty members of the House of Commons, were joined with them as lay assessors. The Scottish members were Alexander Henderson, Robert Douglas, and George Gillespie, of Edinburgh, Samuel Rutherford of St Andrews, and Robert Baillie of Glasgow, ministers ; John Earl of Cassillis, John Lord Maitland, and Sir Archibald Johnston of Warriston, ruling elders. The as sembly continued to sit for a number of years, during which, they drew up a Directory for Public Worship, a Confession of Faith, a Form of Church Government and Discipline, and the Catechisms Larger and Shorter. 33. The campaign of 1644 proved very disastrous to the king, and the decisive victory of Marston Moor gained by Cromwell and David Leslie gave a fatal blow to the royal cause. But at this crisis, the king's affairs were revived a little in Scotland, through the skill and valour of the celebrated Montrose. Having received a supply of eleven hundred men from Leland, this brave and skilful warrior immediately put himself at then head, and being joined by thirteen hundred Highlanders, he attacked Lord Elcho, who lay at Tippermuir near Perth, with six thousand men, and completely de feated him, killing two thousand of the Covenanters (Sept. 1, 1644). He next marched northwards, in order to rouse the Marquis of Huntly and the Gordons, and, at Aberdeen, attacked and entirely"], [227, "A. D. 1645.] CHARLES I. 199 defeated Lord Burley, who commanded two thousand five hundred men. 34. Montrose was now, however, in a very dangerous situation. Argyle was behind him with a powerful army, while the militia of the northern counties of Moray, Ross, and Caithness, to the num ber of five thousand men, opposed him in front. But by rapid marches through almost inaccessible mountains, he succeeded in getting clear of his enemies and placing himself out of their reach. 35. Shortly after, having obtained some reinforcements of Athole men and Macdonalds, though it was the dead of winter, and the ground was covered with snow, he marched across the mountains and fell suddenly upon Argyle's countiy, letting loose upon it all the horrors of war in their most savage forms. Having collected three thousand men, Argyle marched in quest of the enemy, who had retired with then plunder, and took up a position at Invcr lochy, supposing himself to be still at a considerable distance from 1 _ I his antagonist. While this force had thus established it k ' seisin front, the Earl of Seaforth, at the head of the gar- I *\u00b040- rison of Inverness, and a body of five thousand newly levied troops, pressed the royalists on the other side, and threatened them with total destruction. The situation of Montrose was critical in the extreme ; but, by a rapid and unexpected march, he hastened to Inverlochy, and presented himself in order of battle before the Covenanters, at the head of about eighteen hundred men. The Campbells made a stout resistance, but were at last defeated with great slaughter. After this victory, Montrose was joined by great numbers of Highlanders, and Seaforth's army dispersed of itself. 36. Alarmed at these victories, the council at Edinburgh sent for Baillie, an officer of reputation, from England, and, joining him in command with Uney, dispatched them with a considerable army against the royalists. Montrose, with a detachment of eight hun dred men, had attacked Dundee, canied it by assault, and given it up to be plundered by his soldiers, when Baillie and Uney, with their whole force, came suddenly upon him. He instantly called off his soldiers from the plunder, put them in order, covered his re treat by a series of skilful man\u0153uvres, and, having marched sixty miles in the face of a superior enemy, without stopping or allowing his soldiers the least time for sleep or refreshment, he at last secured himself in the mountains. His antagonists now imprudently di vided their forces ; and at Auldearn, near Inverness, he attacked Urrey, and completely routed him. Baillie then advanced to re venge Urrey's defeat ; but he himself met with a similar fate at Al ford, July 2, 1645. 37. Victorious in so many battles, Montrose now descended into"], [228, "[A. D. 1645. 200 HISTORY' OF SCOTLAND. the southern counties, in order to put down completely the powei of the parliament. The Covenanters assembling their whole force, gave him battle at Kilsyth, but were totally defeated, with the loss of above four thousand men. The royal cause seemed now com pletely dominant in Scotland. In this extremity, David Leslie was detached from the army in England, and marched to the relief of the Covenanters. After his victory at Kilsyth, Montrose advanced still farther to the south, in the hopes of rousing to arms the Earls of Home, Traquair, and Roxburgh, who had promised to join him, and of obtaining from England some supply of cavalry, in which he was still very deficient. But he was suddenly surprised by Leslie at Philiphaugh, near Selkirk ; and, after a sharp conflict, his army was totally routed, and he was himself forced to flee to the mountains. 38. The affairs of the king had now become desperate, and, in order to escape being taken prisoner by Fairfax, Charles quitted Oxford, and fled to the Scottish camp before Newark. It has often been asserted that the payment of the an-ears due to the Scots was given as an equivalent for their surrender of the king's person. This mistatement of facts, however, is as gross as the stigma attached to the Scottish nation is undeserved. The payment of the army's arrears was voted by the English parliament on the 5th of Septem ber ; the negotiations respecting the king were not concluded till the 10th of January following. He was not given up to his Eng lish subjects till he had not only positively refused to comply with the terms which the Scots had urgently pressed upon him, but had written repeatedly to the English parliament, expressing his desire to be near them, the more speedily and effectually to conclude the long-continued negotiations. To have attempted to retain him, in these circumstances, against his will, would have led, not merely to a breach of the league with England, but to a civil war. 39. Scarcely had the parliament obtained a complete ascendancy over the king, when they were obliged to submit to the dictation of Cromwell and the army ; and the constitution was superseded by a military despotism. The Scots now sound that, in the matter of Presbytery, no less than in the conduct of the war, and the policy pursued towards the king, they had been oveneached and deceived. This discovery brought on an accommodation between Charles and a part of his Scottish subjects, who, in consideration of his Majesty agreeing to confirm the Covenant in parliament, and to establish the Presbyterian church, till it should be revised by the Assembly of Divines, engaged to assert and restore his authority by force of arms. Accordingly, an army of twenty thousand men, under the Duke of Hamilton, marched into England for the purpose of reco vering the king out of the hands of his enemies ; but they were to-"], [229, "A. D. 1645.] CHARLES I. 201 tally defeated by Cromwell, and Hamilton himself was taken pri soner, and ultimately executed. 40. Cromwell, having now completely crashed all opposition, expelled from the House of Commons the members of the Presby terian party, and prepared to bring Charles himself to the block. A vote was carried in the Rump parliament, declaring it treason in a king to levy war against his parliament. It was resolved that a high court of justice should be appointed to tiy Charles for this newly-invented treason. The court consisted of a hundred and thirty-three persons named by the Commons ; but of these about seventy only met upon the trial. The members were chiefly com posed of officers of the army, together with some of the members of the Lower House, and a few citizens of London. Bradshaw, a lawyer, was chosen president. The court sat in Westminster Hall. When the king was brought forward before this court, he was con ducted by the mace-bearer to a chair placed within the bar. Though long detained a prisoner, and now produced as a criminal, he still maintained the dignity of a king. The charge was then read by Coke, who was appointed solicitor for the people of England, ac cusing the king of having been the cause of all the blood which had been shed since the commencement of the war. After which Brad shaw, directing his discourse to Charles, told him that the court ex pected his answer. 41. The king began his defence by declining the authority of the court. He represented that, having been engaged in treaty with his two houses of parliament, and having finished almost every ar- ticle, he expected a different treatment from that which he had now received. He perceived, he said, no appearance of the Upper House, which was necessary to constitute a just tribunal. He alleged that he was himself the king and fountain of law, and, consequently, could not be tried by laws to which he had never given his assent ; that having been entrusted with the liberties of the people, he would not now betray them, by recognising a power founded on usurpa- tion ; that he was willing, before a proper tribunal, to enter into the particulars of his defence ; but that, until then, he must decline any apology for his innocence, lest he should be considered as the betrayer of, and not a martyr for, the constitution. Bradshaw, in order to support the authority of the court, insisted that they were delegated by the people, the source of all right. He pressed the king not to decline the authority of the court, and intenupted, over ruled, and browbeat him in his attempts to reply. In this manner the king was three times produced before the court, and as often persisted in declining its jurisdiction. The fourth and last time he was brought before this self-elected tribunal, he was insulted in his"], [230, "[A. D. 1649. 202 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. way thither by the soldiers and the mob, who cried out, \" Justice ! justice ! Execution ! execution !\" but he continued undaunted. His judges now examined some witnesses, by whom it was proved that the king had appeared in arms against the forces commissioned by parliament, and then pronounced sentence against him. 42. The behaviour of Charles throughout this trying scene was manly, firm, and dignified. In leaving the hall, the soldiers and rabble were again instigated to cry out \" Justice,\" and \" Execu tion,\" and to revile him with the most bitter reproaches. Amongst other insults, one miscreant presumed to spit in his face. He pa tiently bore their insolence. \u2014 \" Poor souls,\" said he, \" they would treat their generals in the same manner for sixpence.\" Those of the populace who still retained the feelings of humanity expressed their sorrow in sighs and tears. A soldier, more compassionate than the rest, could not refrain from imploring a blessing on his royal head : an officer, overhearing him, struck the honest sentinel to the ground before the king, who could not help saying that the punishment exceeded the offence. 43. On his return to Whitehall, Charles desired permission to see his children, and to be attended in his private devotions by Dr Juxon, late Bishop of London. These requests were granted, and three days were also allowed him to prepare for death. Every night between his sentence and execution, the king slept soundly as usual, though the noise of the workmen employed in erecting the scaffold continually resounded in his ears. The fatal morning having at last anived, Charles rose early, and calling one of his attendants, bade him employ more than usual care in dressing him, and preparing him for so great a solemnity. The street before Whitehall was the place destined for his execution. He was led through the banquet ing-house to the scaffold adjoining to that edifice, attended by Bishop Juxon. The scaffold, covered with black, was guarded by a regiment of soldiers, under the command of Colonel Tomlinson ; and on it were to be seen the block, the axe, and two executioners in masks. The people in crowds stood at a distance. The king sur veyed all these solemn preparations with composure ; and, as he could not expect to be heard by the people at a distance, he ad dressed himself to the few persons who stood around him. He there justified his own innocence in the late fatal ware, observing that he had not taken arms till after the parliament had set him the exam ple, and that he had no other object in his warlike preparations than to preserve that authority entire which had been transmitted to him by his ancestors. But though innocent towards his people, he ac knowledged the equity of his condemnation in the eyes of his Maker, and owned that he was justly punished for having consented to the"], [231, "A. D. 1649.] THE COMMONWEALTH. 203 execution of an unjust sentence against the Earl of Stratford. He forgave all his enemies, exhorted the people to return to then obe dience, and acknowledged his son as his successor, and signified his attachment to the Protestant religion, as professed by the Church of England. So strong was the impression made by his dying words on those who could hear him, that Colonel Tomlinson himself, to whose care he had been committed, acknowledged himself a con vert. At one blow his head was severed from his body. The exe cutioner then holding up the head, exclaimed, \" This is the head of a traitor.\" 44. Charles was of a middling stature, robust, and well propor tioned. His countenance was pleasant, but melancholy ; and it is probable that the continual troubles in which he was involved might have given this expression to his features. He was executed on the 30th of January 1649, in the forty-ninth year of his age, and twenty-fourth of his reign. CHAPTER XX. A. D. 1649 to 1685. The Commonwealth. \u2014 Charles II.

The Scots had long been dissatisfied with the conduct of the dominant party in England, and the execution of the king com pleted their alienation of feeling. They now determined to acknow ledge Prince Charles as their king ; and the crown was according ly offered to him on certain conditions. Charles, however, had by this time commanded Montrose to attempt a descent in his favour upon Scotland by force of arms ; and with characteristic duplicity he protracted the negotiations until the result of this enterprise should be known. But the career of Montrose was destined to be a short one. He landed in Orkney, where he obtained some re cruits, and passed over to the mainland of Scotland, with the de-"], [232, "[A. D. 1651. 204 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. sign of penetrating into the Highlands. But just as he advanced beyond the pass of Invercan-on, on the confines of Ross, he was attacked by Strachan, the general of the Covenanters, at the head of a superior force ; and his raw recruits were, after a short conflict, beaten and dispersed. Montrose contrived to effect his escape, but having been ultimately captured by Macleod of As synt, who, before this reverse of fortune, had been on the eve of joining his standard, he was basely betrayed by that mean and sordid chief for a quantity of oatmeal. Being brought prisoner to Edinburgh, he was condemned, on a former attainder, to be hang ed, for the space of three hours, on a gibbet thirty feet high, and his limbs were ordered to be stuck up in the principal towns of the kingdom. 2. After the defeat and death of Montrose, Charles no^longer he sitated to accept the terms offered by the Covenanters, and to take the Covenant, if required to do so ; and having embarked with his court in a Dutch fleet, he anived at the mouth of the Spey. But as the jealousy of the people had been roused by the late invasion, the Covenant was exacted from him before he was suffered to land. 3. As soon as the English parliament learned that the Scots had raised a considerable army in support of the royal cause, they pre pared to invade Scotland ; and in a month from the time of the king's arrival, Cromwell was on the banks of the Tweed, at the head of sixteen thousand veteran troops. The Scots made vigorous prepa rations for his reception. The command of their troops was given to General Leslie, who established a fortified camp between Edin burgh and Leith, and remained resolutely on the defensive, in spite of every expedient tried by his adversary to draw him out to action. Cromwell, foiled in his designs by this judicious conduct, became greatly straitened for provisions, and withdrew his army to Dunbar. Leslie followed his movements, and encamped on the heights which command the town, taking care, at the same time, to occupy the passes by which alone the enemy could retire to Berwick. Cromwell's situation had now become most critical. But he was rescued from almost certain destruction by the gross folly of a committee of church and state, who, fearing that the enemy would escape, forced Leslie to descend to the plain, and attack the English. When Cromwell discovered that the Scots were actually in motion, he exclaimed, \" the Lord hath delivered them into our hands.\" His anticipations were speedily realized. Descending from the hills during a tempestuous night, which had extinguished their matches, the Scots, consisting entirely of raw undisciplined levies, were over thrown at the first onset by the veteran troops of Cromwell, who had been carefully sheltered from the storm. Three thousand were"], [233, "A. D. 1651.] 205 THE COMMONWEALTH. slain, and nine thousand made prisoners. The victor immediately marched to Edinburgh, which threw open its gates at his approach. 4. This disaster shewed, in a striking point of view, the danger of disunion. In a meeting held at Perth, the Scottish parliament accordingly resolved to call in the aid of the malignants and en gagers \u2014 that is, the Royalists and moderate Presbyterians \u2014 who had recently been expelled from the camp. On the 1st of January 1651, the coronation of Charles was performed with great solemnity at Scone. There, on his bended knees, with his arm upraised, he swore to observe strictly the two Covenants ; to establish the Pres byterian government in Scotland and in his own family ; to give his assent to acts for establishing it in his other dominions ; and to rale according to the law of God, aud the venerated laws of the land. Argyle then placed the crown upon the king's head ; and having seated him on the throne, both nobility and gentiy swore allegiance \" according to the national covenant, and the Solemn League and Covenant.\" 5. In the mean time, Cromwell was making rapid progress in subduing the kingdom, having gained possession of Edinburgh Castle, Tantallon, and many other places of inferior note. Charles had taken up a strong position near Stirling, and contented himself with remaining on the defensive. But Cromwell crossed the Forth with his army, and advanced on the rear of the Scots, who found their position thus completely turned. In these circumstances, Charles adopted the bold resolution of marching into England, in the expectation that his friends in that country would flock to his standard. He accordingly set out from Stirling in the direction of Carlisle, accompanied by twelve thousand men, and gained an ad vance of three days before the movement was discovered. 6. Cromwell, who had not calculated on such a daring adventure, was surprised and embarrassed. But he quickly assembled a large force, and set out in pursuit of the fugitive invaders, who had met with none of the support upon which they had so confidently rec koned. At last, the Scottish army, which had thrown itself into Worcester, was attacked by Cromwell, at the head of thirty thon sand men, and, after a desperate contest, completely defeated. The battle was fought on the 3d of September 1651, the day on which, twelve months before, the English general had defeated the Scots at Dunbar. The Duke of Hamilton was mortally wounded ; and the king himself, who had greatly signalized his personal cou rage during the battle, was compelled to save himself by flight. After cutting off his hair, the better to disguise his person, he worked for some days in the habit of a peasant, making faggots in a wood. He next attempted to retire into Wales, under the con-"], [234, "[A. D. 1658 206 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. duct of one Pendril, a poor farmer, who was sincerely attached to his cause ; but in this attempt he failed, as every pass was guarded to prevent his escape. Being compelled to return, he met one Careless, who had escaped the carnage at Worcester, and in his company the king was obliged to climb a spreading oak, among the branches of which they lay concealed during the day, while the soldiers of the enemy were heard in pursuit of them below. After this he experienced all the varieties of famine, fatigue, and pain, till he arrived at the house of Colonel Lane, a zealous royalist in Staffordshire. Here he deliberated about the means of escaping to France ; and Bristol being supposed the most suitable port, it was resolved that he should ride thither before this gentleman's sister, on a visit to a person who lived in the neighbourhood of that city. During this journey, the king every day met with persons whose faces he knew, and at one time passed through a whole regiment of the enemy's army. But on finding that for a month to come no ship would sail from Bristol, either for France or Spain, he was obliged to go elsewhere for a passage. He, therefore, repaired to the house of Colonel Wyndham, in Dorsetshire, where he was cor dially received ; and thence pursuing his journey to the sea-side, he once more had a narrow escape at an inn, where a smith disco vered that his horse's shoes had been made in the north. At Shoreham, in Sussex, a vessel was at last found, in which he em barked. He was known to so many, that, if he had not set sail at that critical moment, it would have been impossible for him to escape. After forty-one days' concealment, he arrived safely in France. No fewer than forty persons had, at different times, been privy to his escape, although a reward of a thousand pounds was offered for his capture. 7. In the mean time, Cromwell returned in triumph, leaving Ludlow to improve the victory ; and his first care was to depress the Scots on account of their having \" withstood the work of the gospel,\" as he called it. An act was passed for abolishing royalty in Scotland, and annexing that kingdom, as a province, to the English commonwealth. It was, however, permitted to send some members to the English parliament. Judges were appointed to dis tribute justice ; and the people, in general, seem not to have been greatly dissatisfied with the government. 8. All parts of the British dominions being now reduced to per fect subjection, the whole civil and military power of the state cen tred in Cromwell, who was fonnally elevated to the supreme power by the title of Protector of the Commonwealth of England. After governing for nine years with uncontrolled authority, he died on the 3d of September 1658, in the fifty-ninth year of his age."], [235, "*.. D. 1660.] 207 CHARLES LT. 9. Oliver Cromwell was succeeded in his office of Protector by his son Richard, who immediately called a parliament. But a col lision speedily took place between this assembly and the army, when the officers surrounding Richard's house forced him to dissolve the parliament ; and he soon afterwards signed an abdication of the government. 10. The officers thus left at liberty, resolved to restore the Rump parliament as it was called, consisting of that remnant of a parlia ment which had condemned Charles. But no sooner were these members reinstated in authority, than they cashiered some of the officers, and appointed in their room others, on whom they could place more reliance. The officers immediately dissolved the assem bly, and proceeded to vest the sovereign authority in a committee of twenty-three persons, of whom seven were officers. 11. Upon learning that the officers had, by then- own authority, dissolved the parliament, General Monk, who was then in Scot land with eight thousand veteran troops, protested against the mea sure, and resolved to defend the national privileges. As soon as he had put his army in motion, he found himself eagerly courted by all parties ; but so cantious was he of declaring his mind, that, to the very last, no one knew which side he would take. On his arrival in London, he at first rendered implicit obedience to the orders of the parliament ; but, in a short time, it became evident that he was wholly alienated from their interests. He resolved to restore the members formerly excluded by the orders of Cromwell, and, by their means, to bring about a new election. This was accordingly done. When the new parliament assembled, a letter was read from the king, offering to grant a general amnesty to all persons whatsoever, without any other exceptions than should be made by parliament, and promising to indulge scrupulous con sciences with liberty in matters of religion, \u2014 to leave to the exa mination of parliament the claims of all such as possessed lands with contested titles, \u2014 to confirm all these concessions by act of parliament, \u2014 to satisfy the army under General Monk with respect to their aneare, and to give the same rank to his officers when they were enlisted in the king's army. In consequence of this agreement between the king and the parliament, Montague, the English admiral, waited on Charles to inform him that the fleet expected his orders at Scheveling. The Duke of York immediately went on board, and took the command as lord high admiral. The king em barked without delay, and landing at Dover, was received by Monk. whom he honoured with particular marks of attention. He entered London on the 29th of May 1660, which was his birth-day, and was"], [236, "[A. D. 1661 208 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. attended by a great number of people, who testified their joy by loud acclamations. 12. Charles II. was thirty years of age at the time of his restora tion. Being naturally of an open affable disposition, he became a favourite with all classes of his subjects. His first measures also were calculated to give general satisfaction. In Scotland, the Pres byterians flattered themselves that they had peculiar claims upon the king's gratitude, on account of their adherence to his cause during the sway of Cromwell. But Charles entertained an invete rate dislike to the Presbyterian form of church government ; and in no long time his real sentiments were made manifest. The Mar quis of Argyle, the leader of the Covenanters, who had placed the crown upon Charles's head in 1651, was seized and brought to trial for actions extending over a period of upwards of twenty years. He was ultimately found guilty of high treason, on account of his com pliance with Cromwell. The proof, however, was exceedingly defective, and he would have been acquitted but for the villany of Monk, now created Duke of Albemarle, who produced some private letters which the Marquis had written to him during the Common wealth, expressing his zeal for the maintenance of that system of government. On evidence thus basely obtained, and which was brought forward in the most illegal manner, the old nobleman was condemned, and executed within two days. 13. Twelve of the most eminent of the Presbyterian ministers, who had come forward with a remonstrance, were seized and committed to prison ; and Guthrie, one of their number, who, ten years be fore, \" had let fly at the king in his sermons,\" and against whom Middleton, the king's commissioner, entertained a personal animo sity, was brought to trial, and condemned to be hanged, a few days after the execution of Argyle. Johnston of Waniston, one of the ablest defenders of the Covenant, who had taken refuge on the Con tinent some time before, was given up by the French government, and sent back to Scotland, and tried and executed. Many others were imprisoned and severely fined, and compelled to purchase their pardon by giving large bribes to the king's ministers. 14. The parliament granted a revenue of forty thousands pounds to the king for life ; and, in the extravagance of their loyalty, passed an act annulling the proceedings of all the parliaments, con ventions, synods, and committees, and all the acts of indemnity, that had been held or passed since the year 1633. Various statutes were also passed, which prepared the way for the abolition of Pres bytery and the restoration of Episcopacy. 15. The Presbyterians were now fully aware of their danger, and. in 1661, deputed Sharpe, one of their number, to lay their"], [237, "A. D. 1666.] Charles ii. 209 grievances before the king. But their deputy betrayed their cause, and, as a reward of his treacheiy, was created archbishop of St Andrews. Along with him, Fairfowl, Hamilton, and Leighton, together with Sydserff, who had received consecration at the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury, hurried down to Scotland to take possession of their sees. The old laws in favour of Episcopacy were revived, and it was enacted that all ministers who would not submit to be ordained anew by the bishop, should be deprived of their benefices. Three hundred and fifty of the clergy nobly submit ted to be driven from their parishes at once, rather than do violence to their consciences by yielding a sinful compliance with this tyran nical enactment. New ministers were sought for all over the king dom, and none were too vicious or ignorant to be rejected. These proceedings, as might have been expected, excited the greatest dis content throughout the nation. 16. In 1664, was passed the infamous bill called the Conventicle Act, which forbade non-conformists, under severe penalties, to fre quent any conventicles or places of worship not of the establish ment. This act was enforced with great rigour. The prisons were soon crowded with offenders against its enactments. Wherever the people had forsaken their churches, troops were quartered through out the country. These legalized banditti were commanded by Sir James Turner, a man of a furious temper and dissolute life, who went about and received lists from the clergy of those who absented themselves from the churches, or were supposed to frequent con venticles. Without proof, he exacted fines, and quartered soldiers on the supposed criminals till he received payment. 17. In consequence of these detestable proceedings, which were carried on under the authority of Lauderdale and Archbishop Sharpe, an insurrection broke out in the west of Scotland. On the 13th of November 1666, the people rose in a body, and, having seized Turner, resolved to put him to death, but finding his orders were much more violent than even his behaviour, they spared his Use. At Lanark they renewed the covenant, and published a mani festo, in which they professed submission to the king, and only desired the re-establishment of Presbytery and the re-instatement of then former ministers. General Dalziel, a soldier of some repu tation, but of savage and brutal manners, took the field to oppose them. Their force, which never exceeded two thousand men, had now been reduced to little more than a thousand, and these were no way capable of contending with regular forces. Having advanced towards Edinburgh and met with no support, they attempted to make their way back to the west by the Pentland Hills. But at a spot called Rullion Green, they were attacked by the king's troops. i 2"], [238, "[A. D. 1678. 210 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND- and though they received the first charge with great firmness, they fell into confusion and fled. About forty were killed on the spot, and a hundred and thirty taken prisoners. 18. Sharpe was the foremost to take vengeance on the unhappy insurgents, whose oppressed state and inoffensive behaviour made them objects of universal sympathy. Ten were hanged on one gibbet in Edinburgh, and thirty-five before then own doors in dif ferent parts of the country. Some of them were previously tor tured, and, after death, their mutilated limbs were stuck up in diffe rent parts of the kingdom. All of them might have saved then lives upon condition of renouncing the covenant ; but this they ab solutely refused. The executions were proceeding without mercy when the king wrote a letter to the privy council, in which he or dered that such of the prisoners as simply promised to obey the laws for the future, should be set at liberty, and that the incorri gible should be sent to the plantations. This letter was brought to the council by Bumet, archbishop of Glasgow, but was kept back for some time by him and his colleague Sharpe. It had been cus tomary to put these unfortunate men to the torture to extort from them a confession, and by the criminal delay of the king's letter, the torture had been inflicted on Hugh Mackail, a young preacher, who would otherwise have escaped. So violent were the torments inflicted on him by the iron boot, that he swooned under them. When at last brought to the place of execution, he died in an ecstasy of joy. His last words, uttered with an accent which struck all the bystanders with astonishment, were in the highest degree impressive and sublime. \" Farewell sun, moon, and stars,\" he exclaimed ; \" farewell world and time ! farewell weak frail body ! Welcome eternity ! welcome angels and saints ! welcome Saviour of the world ! and welcome God the judge of all ! \" 19. In spite of these savage persecutions, the people clung firmly to then religion ; and all the efforts of Charles and his ministers to suppress it, proved wholly unsuccessful. In this situation recourse was had to the notable expedient of causing his Majesty to take out a general writ of lawburrows against his whole Scottish subjects. Accordingly, a bond of the peace was framed, by which the sub scribers became bound, under heavy penalties, neither to frequent conventicles themselves, nor to allow their families and tenants to be present at such unlawful assemblies, nor in any way to infringe the public peace. This extraordinary proceeding at once betrayed the jealousy of the government and rendered it ridiculous. 20. These violent measures having been found ineffectual, a Scheme of Comprehension was tried in 1678, by which it was pro posed greatly to diminish the authority of the bishops, and to leave"], [239, "A. D. 1678.] 211 CHARLES II. them little more than the right of precedency among the presbyters. But this, too, was rejected by the people, who well knew its cha racter and tendency. The next project was that of an Indulgence, by which the most popular of the expelled preachers, without being required to accede to any terms of submission to the established religion, were settled in vacant churches, and small salaries of about twenty pounds a-year were offered to the rest, till they should be otherwise provided for. These tardy and suspicious boons were at first accepted by some of the less firm and decided of the clergy, but the insidious design was speedily discovered. The replaced minis ters soon repented of their compliance. The bounty was rejected as the wages of criminal silence, conventicles multiplied, and the Covenanters, now at open hostility with the law, met in arms at their places of worship, though, after divine service, they dispersed quietly. 21. During the course of these violent proceedings, an event oc- curred which, in all its circumstances, is eminently characteristic of the men who bore rule at this period. One evening, in July 1668, as the Archbishop of St Andrews was sitting in his coach in the High Street of Edinburgh, while the Bishop of Orkney was in the act of stepping into it, a young Covenanter, named James Mitchell, fired a pistol at the primate, but the Bishop of Orkney happening at the instant to extend his arm, intercepted the shot, and was in consequence severely wounded. Though this occurred in the prin- cipal street of the city, yet so generally was Sharpe hated, that the assassin was allowed to walk off without intemiption. Six years after this, Sharpe happening one day to notice a man who seemed to observe him narrowly, and dreading lest another attempt at assassination should be made, caused him to be anested and ex- amined. Two loaded pistols were found upon his person ; and as he was now concluded to have been the author of the former attempt, Sharpe promised that if he would confess his guilt he should be dis- missed without any punishment. Mitchell was credulous enough to believe the Archbishop, and was immediately produced by him before the privy council. But this conclave having no proof against him, and hoping to implicate in his crime the whole body of the Covenanters, solemnly renewed the promise of pardon, upon con- dition that he should make a full disclosure. Mitchell accepted the terms offered him ; but, when the council found by his confession, that only one person, then dead, had been privy to his design, their rage and disappointment knew no bounds. He was immediately carried before the Court of Justiciary, and required to renew his confession. Mitchell now saw with whom he had to deal, and re fused to comply. He was, in consequence, put to the torture, which"], [240, "212 [A. D. 1679 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. he endured with singular fortitude, obstinately persisting in his re fusal to criminate himself, till he fainted through excessive agony. He was then sent to the Bass, which was at that time used as a state prison for the persecuted Covenanters, and remained there loaded with irons in the greatest misery, till the end of the year 1678. Infuriated at the failure of all their coercive measures, and, resolved, by some new examples, to strike terror into the Cove nanters, the council once more produced him, and he was put upon his trial for his attempt on the Archbishop's life. The only proof of his guilt was his former confession, which he pleaded had been made upon promise of pardon. But Lauderdale, Rothes, Maitland, and Sharpe, all expressly swore that no assurance of life had been given him, although the records of the privy council still remain an incontestable proof of their perjury. The prisoner then demanded that the council-books should be examined ; but this was refused, and the unhappy man was condemned and executed. 22. When Lauderdale, who perhaps felt some remorse on account of the iniquitous means employed to obtain his conviction, wished to commute Mitchell's sentence, Sharpe interposed, and insisted upon its execution, as the only way of securing his own life against a repetition of similar attempts. But the fate he dreaded speedily overtook him. On the 5th of May 1679, he was waylaid and mur dered by a small body of men, headed by Hackston of Rathillet and Balfour of Burley. The perpetrators of this savage deed were actuated solely by their own fanaticism or revenge ; but their act was nevertheless imputed to the party to which they belonged, and was made the pretext for inflicting the most shocking cruelties on the Covenanters. 23. Shortly before this, Lauderdale had endeavoured to compel the landholders in the western counties to enter into engagements, under heavy penalties, to prevent the assembling of conventicles on their estates. On their refusal, six thousand wild Highlanders were let loose on these districts, to live at free quarters, with full licence to plunder the defenceless inhabitants at their pleasure. Dragoons were employed to disperse the field meetings ; and as the Covenanters were now obliged to cany arms for their own security, bloody encounters frequently took place between them and the king's troops. Graham of Claverhouse, an active and merciless agent of the council, attacked a great conventicle at Drumclog, on the bor ders of Ayrshire ; but was repulsed, with the loss of thirty men. The Covenanters, finding themselves thus, without premeditation, drawn into rebellion, were obliged to persevere ; and therefore pushed on to Glasgow, of which they made themselves masters, and proceeded to dispossess the established clergy."], [241, "MURDER OF ARCHBISHOP SHARPE. An. 1679."], [242, ""], [243, "A. D. 1681.] 213 CHARLES II. 24. Alarmed at this rising, Charles dispatched against the Co venanters a small body of English cavalry, under the Duke of Mon mouth, who, having joined the Scottish guards, and some regiments of militia, marched with great celerity in quest of the insurgents. They had taken up a position at Bothwell Bridge, between Hamilton and Glasgow ; and here they were attacked by the royal army, on the 22d of June 1679. A party of the Covenanters stoutly defended the bridge for a considerable time ; but their ammunition having failed, they were compelled to retire from their post. Monmouth immediately passed the bridge, and put the insurgents to the rout. About four or five hundred were killed, and twelve hundred taken prisoners. Three hundred of these were shipped for Barbadoes, but unfortunately perished during the voyage. Two of then clergymen were hanged, and five were executed on Magus Muir, where Sharpe was murdered. Soon afterwards, an act of indemnity was passed, but Lauderdale took care that it should afford little protection to the unhappy Covenanters ; for although orders were given to con nive at all conventicles, he found means, under a variety of pre tences, to elude the execution of them. 25. Shortly after the battle of Bothwell Bridge, Cameron and Cargill, two celebrated preachers, goaded on by that oppression which \" makes a wise man mad,\" publicly excommunicated the king for his immorality, tyranny, and breach of the covenant, and re nounced their allegiance to him. At the head of a small body of faithful adherents, they prepared to support their bold defiance by force of arms ; but they were surprised and defeated (in 1680) at Airdsmoss, by three troops of dragoons. Cameron fell in the skir mish, fighting with heroic corn-age ; his brother, with seven of his companions, shared his fate. Hackston of Rathillet, and a few others, were wounded and made prisoners, and were afterwards executed with eveiy circumstance of barbarity. 26. In 1681, the Duke of York succeeded Lauderdale in the ma nagement of Scottish affairs. He prevailed upon the parliament to enact a test to be taken by all persons holding public offices, who were to swear to maintain the supremacy of the king and the doc trine of passive obedience. When Argyle was called upon to take it, he added this explanation, that he took it, \" so far as it was con sistent with itself ; and that he meant not to preclude himself, in a lawful way, from endeavouring to make such alterations in church and state as he might judge beneficial.\" For this explanation he was imprisoned in the castle of Edinburgh, and brought to trial upon a charge of treason. A jury of his personal enemies, with the Marquis of Montrose at their head, found him guilty, and he received sentence of death. He escaped, however, from the castle"], [244, "214 [A. D. 1685. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. in disguise, and found refuge in Holland. But sentence of attain der was passed against him, and his honours and estates were de clared forfeited. 27. The Duke of York was shortly after recalled to England ; but the consequent change of administration was productive of little or no relief to Scotland. The Covenanters were hunted like partridges on the mountains ; and many of them, including even fe males, laid down their lives in testimony of the sincerity of their belief. Even those innocent of all offence towards the government, were insidiously involved in the same fate with those who had open ly defied it. Taking advantage of the spirit which the cruelties of the government had excited and inflamed, the privy council sought to entrap their victims by means of ensnaring questions, such as \u2014 Was Archbishop Sharpe's death murder ? Was the rising at Both well Bridge rebellion ? Is Charles a rightful king or a tyrant ? The persons to whom these interrogatories were put, were, for the most part, too sincere to dissemble their opinions, and too fearless to be intimidated even by the most cruel tortures, and were com monly dismissed from the iron boot to the Court of Justiciary, and thence, by a rapid transition, to the scaffold. 28. In 1684, shortly after the execution of Lord William Russell and Algernon Sydney, several of their Scottish friends were arrested in London, on a charge of being privy to the Rye House plot, and were sent down to Edinburgh for trial. Baillie of Jerviswood, a noble-minded patriot, was the first victim. His trial was conduct ed with a most shameful disregard of the laws of Scotland. Being broken down by infirmities and long suffering, he was executed on the same day he was condemned, lest a natural death in his dun geon should have disappointed his enemies of a public execution. Several others were put to death ; but a considerable number, in cluding Lords Melville and Loudon, and Sir Patrick Hume, after wards Earl of Marchmont, escaped into Holland. Carstairs, after wards principal of the University of Edinburgh, Spenco, the Earl of Ai-gyle's secretary, and several other gentlemen, were cruelly tortured, with a view of extorting from them a confession of their guilt. 29. In the midst of these sanguinary proceedings, the king was seized with a fit of apoplexy on the 2d of February 1685, and, four days after, he expired, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-fourth of his reign. In person, Charles was tall and well proportioned, with a swarthy complexion, and features austere and forbidding. He had good talents, but his insuperable indolence dis qualified him for business, and kept him in a state of the most dis graceful ignorance. Amusement was his chief pursuit ; and he"], [245, "A. D. 1685.] james 11. 216 seems to have cared little for anything beyond the gratification of this propensity. He was a master in the art of dissimulation, which he looked upon as the grand secret in the art of reigning. The whole tenor of his conduct, especially during the latter part of his reign, indicates his tyrannical disposition, and his desire to subvert the liberties of the people. With respect to religion, he appears to have had no fixed belief, although he had professedly embraced Romanism before the Restoration, and again signified his adherence to it a few hours before his death.

Charles was succeeded by his brother, who assumed the title of James the Second of England, and Seventh of Scotland. His ac cession brought no relief to the persecuted Covenanters. The laws for apprehending, examining, and executing on the spot those sus pected of adherence to the Covenant, were enforced with the same relentless severity. The administering or receiving the Covenant, or even writing in its defence, the refusal to bear evidence against a person accused of treason, and many other offences of a similar kind, were all declared treasonable, and punished by death and con fiscation. These cruel and oppressive measures would, it was sup posed, lead to a general desire to shake off the yoke of James, should opportunity be offered ; and, accordingly, the disaffected persons who had fled to Holland resolved to undertake a simultaneous de scent upon England and Scotland, in the hope of being joined by the great body of the people. The Earl of Argyle, with Sir Patrick Hume, Sir John Cochrane, and other Scottish exiles, to the num-"], [246, "216 [A. D. 1685. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ber of about three hundred, sailed from Holland with three vessels laden with arms and ammunition, and landed in Kentire in the West Highlands, where they were joined by a thousand men be longing to the clan Campbell. But the insurgents were divided among themselves as to their plan of operations, and much valua ble time was wasted in unprofitable disputes. At length it was de termined to make a descent into the Lowlands ; and Argyle, with an army now augmented to two thousand five hundred men, de scended into Lennox, and proposed to cross the Clyde. But a for midable body of the king's forces having marched against him from different points, his army broke up and dispersed, and he himself was taken prisoner near Renfrew, carried to Edinburgh, and, after suffering many indignities, was executed on his former iniquitous sentence. Upwards of twenty of the most considerable gentlemen of his clan, and a number of his Lowland followers were put to death for their share in this transaction. 2. During the alarm created by Argyle's invasion, the privy council ordered all the Covenanters who were in prison to be sent to the north for their more safe custody. After a toilsome march, during which they were subjected to the greatest hardships and in dignities, they reached the place of their destination, the castle of Dunnottar, where, to the number of one hundred and sixty per sons, including several women and children, they were thrust into a large naked dungeon. Their guards allowed them neither bed ding nor provisions, excepting what they bought, and made them pay for eveiy indulgence, even that of water. Many of them died in consequence of this horrid confinement, and the shocking tor tures to which they were subjected. At the end of six weeks or two months, the survivors had the test offered to them ; those who agreed to take it were discharged ; those who refused were transport ed to the plantations. These oppressive measures excited a strong feeling against the king's government, which gathered strength every day from the tyrannical and foolish proceedings of James, both in England and Scotland. He now began to throw off the mask, and to endeavour openly to establish popery and arbitrary power. The honible judicial murders of Jeffries, in the west of England, after the failure of Monmouth's expedition, \u2014 the dispensing at once, by the king's own authority, with all the penal laws affecting Roman Catholics, and the annulling the oath of supremacy and the test, \u2014 the re-establishment of the oppressive and vexatious Court of High Commission, \u2014 the imprisonment and trial of the bishops, because of their refusal to read in the churches a second decla ration of indulgence, dispensing, on his own authority, with the test and penal laws, \u2014 and many other arbitrary acts of a similar kind,"], [247, "A. D. 1688.] 217 JAMES II. left the people no room for doubt that James intended to usurp de spotic power over the bodies and consciences of his subjects. 3. During this course of misgoverament, the patriotic and public spirited part of the nation turned their eyes to William, Prince of Orange, who had married James's eldest daughter Mary. Press ing invitations were addressed to him by the most influential per sons in the kingdom, desiring his aid in maintaining the liberties of the country. He at length determined to comply with their request, and accordingly set sail from Helvoetsluys with a fleet of nearly five hundred sail, and an army of fourteen thousand men, and after a voyage of two days, landed at Torbay on the 5th of November 1688, the anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot. 4. But although the invitation given to William was very gene ral, he had the mortification to find himself at first joined by very few. After the lapse of ten days, however, several persons of in fluence gave in their adherence to him, and the whole countiy soon afterwards flocked to his standard. Every day brought some new proof of that universal hostility which the nation entertained against the measures of the king. The defection of the army soon followed. Several noblemen and officers of rank, including, among others, Lord Churchill, afterwards the celebrated Duke of Marlborough, publicly deserted, and carried over to the prince's army several re giments of soldiers. To add to the distress of the unhappy monarch, the Princess Anne, James's favourite daughter, perceiving the des perate state of his affairs, resolved to take part with the Prince of Orange. At the tidings of this event, the king was stung with the most bitter anguish. \" God help me,\" said he, \" my own children desert me.\" 5. James now became alarmed for the safety of his queen and her infant son, and sent them off to France. He soon after resolved to leave the kingdom, in the vain hope that his absence would plunge every thing into confusion, and that he would derive advan tage to his affairs from the anarchy and disorder. Accordingly, he disappeared on the night of the 10th of December, accompanied only by Sir Edward Hales, and another friend ; but they were seized at Feversham, on suspicion of being papists who wanted to escape out of the kingdom, and were exposed to the insults of some rude fisher men before the king's person was recognised. James was brought back to London, where he arrived on the 16th. But the news of his return gave little satisfaction to the Prince of Orange, whose aim from the beginning was to force his father-in-law, by various means, to relinquish the throne. He therefore conducted himself towards the king with such coldness and severity as alarmed him foi his personal safety, and caused him to resume his purpose of K"], [248, "218 [A. D. 1689. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. flight. James desired permission to retire to Rochester, which was readily granted. He remained there three nights, in the midst of a few faithful friends, who earnestly entreated him to remain in Eng land, but in vain. He privately embarked on board a frigate, and on the 25th of December was safely landed at Ambleteuse, in France. 6. After the flight of the king, the Prince of Orange summoned a convention at Westminster. At their first meeting, thanks were voted to the prince for the deliverance which he had achieved for the nation. They then proceeded, by a great majority, to vote that King James, having endeavoured to subvert the constitution, and having withdrawn himself out of the kingdom, had abdicated the government, and that the throne was thereby vacant. 7. The king being thus set aside, the convention proceeded to take into consideration the appointment of a successor. Proposals were made by some for electing a regent ; others were for investing the Prince and Princess of Orange with regal power. On learning these proposals, William summoned a small council of leading per sons, and stated that he thought it necessary to inform them, that if they chose a regent, he would not accept that office. Neither was he disposed to take the government of the kingdom under the princess his wife. If either of these schemes were adopted, he informed them that he could give them no assistance in the settle ment of the nation, but would return home to his own country. Upon this it was agreed, after a long debate, that the Prince and Princess of Orange should reign jointly, as king and queen of Eng land, whilst the administration of government should be placed in the hands of the prince only. Accordingly, on the 13th of Febru ary 1689, William and Mary were proclaimed king and queen of England. 8. In the mean time, the revolution had been effected in Scot land. The Presbyterians assumed arms in various parts of the country, in open opposition to the government of James. The Earl of Perth, the chancellor, becoming tenified, attempted to escape from the kingdom, but was taken and cast into prison. A mob of apprentices, and other citizens of the meaner class in Edinburgh, assisted by the city-guard, made an attack on the palace of Holy rood, where James had established a Roman Catholic chapel, and a seminary of Jesuits ; and, after a fierce contest with the soldiers by whom it was ganisoned, the palace was taken by storm, the chapel was rifled, the images and books burnt, and the royal sepul chres scandalously violated. 9. It is to the credit of the Presbyterians, however, that they made no attempt to retaliate on their oppressors the craelties which they had for nearly thirty years suffered at their hands. But they"], [249, "A. D. 1689.] JAMES II. 219 expelled the Episcopal curates from their parishes, and, in some cases, plundered the private chapels of the Roman Catholics, and destroyed the instruments of their worship. 10. After the flight of the king, Scotland was for some time vir tually without a government. Thirty Scottish peers and eighty gentlemen then in London, held a meeting, and, after some deli beration, waited on the Prince of Orange in a bod)', and requested him to take the administration into his own hands. He thanked them for the trust they had reposed in him, and a convention of the Scottish Estates was ordered to meet at Edinburgh on the 14th of March 1689. When the convention assembled, it was found that the adherents of the exiled monarch formed a minority, and various desperate measures were proposed by the more violent of the party for the purpose of preventing the settlement of the crown on the Prince of Orange ; but, through the timidity of some of their adhe rents, and the procrastination and folly of others, all then schemes fell to the ground. At last the notorious Claverhouse, who was now ennobled under the title of Viscount Dundee, suddenly appeared before the convention, aud, alleging that a plot had been formed by the Covenanters to assassinate him and Sir George Mackenzie, the late king's advocate, demanded that all strangers should be removed from the town. This was at once refused, as it would have placed the convention at the mercy of the Duke of Gordon, who held the castle for King James. Dundee then left the assembly in indigna tion, and, mounting his horse, rode out of the city at the head of fifty troopers. In consequence of his departure, the other friends of James also left Edinburgh, and retired to then own homes. This circumstance produced unanimity in all the succeeding resolutions of the convention. It was resolved that James had forfeited his right to the crown ; and AVilliam and Maiy were raised to the va cant throne, and publicly proclaimed at Edinburgh on the 11th of April 1689. The convention-parliament also proceeded to re-esta blish Presbyterianism, to restore the forfeited honours and estates of Argyle and others who had suffered during the late persecutions, and to restrain the despotic powers of the privy council. 11. The castle of Edinburgh was still kept in the name of James by the Duke of Gordon ; but despairing of relief, and pressed by a siege, his Grace sunendered it on the 13th of June. The hopes of James and his adherents were now fixed on Dundee, who, having been in vain urged by the convention to return, had at length been declared an outlaw and a rebel. A military force was sent out to an-est him ; but, being apprised of their design, he retired into the Highlands, where, by great exertions, he succeeded in raising an army of two thousand five hundred men, including three hundred"], [250, "[A. D. 1690. 220 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Irish recruits. With these forces he took post at the upper extre mity of the celebrated pass of Killiecrankie, and resolved to give battle to General Mackay, who, with an army considerably supe rior in numbers, was advancing against him. The encounter took place on the 17th of July 1689. Dundee delayed his attack until about sunset, when suddenly the Highlanders rushed down like furies, covering themselves from the fire of the king's troops with their targets. The charge was like a torrent, fierce, rapid, irresis tible, and the rout was complete. But Dundee having been mor tally wounded in the moment of victor)', the consternation occasioned by his fall prevented an immediate pursuit through the pass. Had the fugitives been closely followed, and had a few men been placed at the southern entrance, not a man of the king's troops would have escaped to tell the story of their defeat. As it was, they lost nearly two thousand men, and the remainder were completely broken and dispersed. But the victoiy was productive of nothing but barren glory ; and, with the death of Dundee, ended all the hopes of James in Scotland. Colonel Cannon, who succeeded him in the command, possessed neither his popularity nor his abilities ; and the Highland ers soon after dispersed in disgust, and returned to their homes. 12. Dining the winter of 1689-90, James sent over General Buchan for the purpose of re-animating the war in the Highlands. A force of about eighteen hundred men was assembled ; but Buchan having with singular want of caution encamped his troops on a level plain called Cromdale, by the side of the river Spey, they were sur prised asleep in their quarters, and completely routed by Sir Thomas Livingstone, at the head of the clan Grant, and a body of cavalry. In Ireland, however, the adherents of James were still numerous and powerful ; but the decisive battle of the Boyne, fought June 30, 1690, ruined his cause, and compelled him again to seek refuge in France. 13. In the beginning of the year 1692, an action of unexampled barbarity disgraced the government of William in Scotland. In the August preceding, a proclamation had been issued, offering an in demnity to such insurgents as should take the oaths of allegiance to the king and queen on or before the last day of December ; and the chiefs of such clans as had been in arms for James soon after took advantage of the proclamation. But Macdonald of Glencoe was prevented, by accident rather than design, from tendering his sub mission within the limited time. In the end of December, he went to Colonel Hill, the governor of Fort -William, and tendered to him his oath of allegiance. But this officer had no power to receive it Sympathizing, however, with the distress of the old chieftain, he furnished him with a letter to Sir Colin Campbell, Sheriff of Ar-"], [251, "MASSACRE OF GLENCOE. ad. 1692."], [252, ""], [253, "A. D. 1692.] 221 JAMES II. gyleshire, requesting him to receive Macdonald's submission, and administer the oath to him, that he might have the advantage of the indemnity. Macdonald hastened from Fort- William to Inver ary with such eagerness, that though the road lay within half a mile of his own house, he stepped not aside to visit his family. But the way to Inveraiy lay through almost impassable mountains, the sea son was extremely rigorous, and the whole country was covered with snow. In consequence of these obstractions, the ill-fated chief did not reach Inverary till after the prescribed time had elapsed. The Sheriff, however, in the circumstances of the case, yielding to the importunities and even tears of Macdonald, administered to him the oath of allegiance, and sent off an express to the Privy Council certifying the fact, and explaining the cause of the delay. 14. But Macdonald had unfortunately rendered himself obnox ious to Sir John Dalryniple, afterwards Earl of Stair, secretary of state for Scotland, and to the powerful Earl of Breadalbane, whose lands the Glencoe men had plundered, and whose plans for the pacification of the Highlands the chieftain had himself thwarted and exposed. He was now made to feel the weight of their ven geance. The Sheriff of Argyle's letter was treacherously kept back, and the certificate of Macdonald's having taken the oath was blotted out from the books of the Privy Council. The king was persuaded that the Macdonalds were the main obstacles to the pacification of the Highlands ; and sanguinary orders for proceeding to military execution against the clan were in consequence obtained. The warrant was both signed and countersigned by the king's own hand, and the secretaiy urged the officers who commanded in the High lands, to execute then orders with the utmost rigour. 15. Campbell of Glenlyon, a captain in Argyle's regiment, and two subalterns, were ordered to repair to Glencoe, on the 1st of February, with a hundred and twenty men. Campbell being uncle to young Macdonald's wife, was received by the chief and his fol lowers with the utmost friendship and hospitality. The men were lodged at free quarters in the houses of the clan, and received the kindest entertainment. Till the 13th of the month, the troops lived in the utmost harmony aud familiarity with the people, and on the very night of the massacre, Glenlyon passed the evening at cards in his own quarters with Macdonald's sons. In the night, Lieutenant Lindsay, with a party of soldiers, called in a friendly manner at the chieftain's house, and was instantly admitted. Macdonald, while in the act of dressing himself, and giving orders for refreshments to be procured for his visitors, was shot dead at his own bedside. His aged wife had already dressed, but she was stripped naked by the soldiers, who tore the rings off her fingers with then teeth."], [254, "222 [A. D. 1695. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. The slaughter now became general, and neither age nor sex was spared. In one place, nine persons, as they sat enjoying them selves at table, were butchered by the soldiers. At the hamlet where Glenlyon had his own quarters, nine men, including his land lord, were bound by the soldiers, and then shot one by one. Thirty eight persons in all were massacred by the troops, and several who fled to the mountains, perished by famine and the inclemency of the season. Those who escaped owed their lives to a tempestuous night. Lieutenant- Colonel Hamilton, who had received the charge of the execution from the secretary of state, was on his march with a hundred men to guard the eastern passes from the valley of Glen coe, but he was prevented by the severity of the weather from reaching the scene of the massacre, till the survivors of the unfortu nate clan had made then escape. He entered the valley next day, laid the houses in ashes, and earned away the cattle and spoiL which were divided among the officers and soldiers. 16. To efface the remembrance of this foul and bloody tragedy, and to silence the execrations which it everywhere excited, the . p king now caused his commissioner to declare in the Scottish j i^ok' parliament, \"That if the members found it would tend I '_ to the advancement of trade, that an act should be passed for the encouragement of such as should acquire and establish a plantation in Africa, America, or any other part of the world where plantations might be lawfully acquired, his majesty was willing to declare that he would grant to the subjects of this kingdom, in favour of these plantations, such rights and privileges as he granted in like cases to the subjects of his other dominions.\" Relying on this and other flattering promises, the nobility and gently of Scotland advanced L.400,000 towards the establishment of a company for carrying on a trade with the East and West Indies ; and twelve hundred veterans, who had served in King William's wars, were sent to effect a settlement on the Isthmus of Darien or Panama, which unites the two great continents of North and South America, and which, from its situation, was equally well adapted for trading with both the Indies. 17. The new colony was well received by the natives, and mat ters began to wear a promising aspect, when the king, at the ear nest solicitations of the English and Dutch India Companies, re solved to gratify the latter at the expense of his Scottish subjects, and sent orders to the governor of Jamaica and the English settle ment in America, to issue proclamations, prohibiting, under the severest penalties, all his majesty's subjects from holding any cor respondence with the Scottish colony, or assisting it in any way with arms, ammunition, or provisions. Thus, the new settlers were"], [255, "A. D. 1702.] 223 ANNE. abandoned to then fate, although many of them had been covered with wounds, in fighting the king's battles ; and thus vanished the hopes of the Scottish nation, which had engaged in the scheme with extraordinary alacrity, aud with sanguine expectations that the mis fortunes of then countiy would, by this new channel of commerce, be completely healed. The distress of the people, upon receiving authentic accounts of the total rain of then colony, scarcely admits of description ; and the whole nation joined in reproaching then sovereign with treachery, inhumanity, and base ingratitude, to a people who had lavished then treasure and best blood in the sup port of his government. 18. William died on the 8th of March 1702, having lived fifty two years, and reigned thirteen. He survived his consort, Queen Maiy, upwards of six years. William left behind him the charac ter of a great politician, and an able general ; and, notwithstanding the wrongs inflicted on the Scottish nation, in the massacre of Glencoe and the affair of Darien, it must be acknowledged that his reign was greatly conducive to the establishment of constitutional liberty. 19. William was succeeded by the Princess Anne, wife of George, Prince of Denmark, and the only surviving daughter of James H. The most remarkable transaction that occurred during the reign of Queen Anne, was the Union between the two kingdoms of England and Scotland. In June 1700, the English parliament passed an Act of Succession, settling the crown, on the failure of Queen Anne and her issue, upon the Princess Sophia, Electress-Dowager of Ha nover, and her descendants. It became a matter of the greatest im portance to the peace of the two countries, that the legislature of Scotland should settle the crown of that kingdom in a similar man ner. But the Scottish people were by no means inclined to concur in the proposed Act of Succession. Instead of complying with the wishes of the English ministry, the parliament of Scotland passed a measure called the Act of Security, by which it was provided, that, in case of Queen Anne's death without children, the Scottish estates should choose a successor, of the royal Hue and Protestant religion ; but it was expressly stipulated that the same person should be incapable of holding the crowns of both kingdoms, unless the honour and independence of the Scottish nation should be secured, and the Scottish people admitted to share with the English the full benefits of navigation and trade. It was provided by the same statute that all the men capable of bearing arms should be trained to the use of them, that they might be ready to defend the liberties of the country in case of danger. 20. The English legislature were enraged at these violent mca-"], [256, "[A. D. 1702. 224 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. sures, and, in return, enacted regulations against the Scottish trade, and ordered the border towns of Newcastle, Berwick, and Carlisle, to be fortified and ganisoned. Other causes of hostility speedily followed. A Scottish ship, equipped for a voyage to India, was seized and detained in the Thames, at the instance of the English East India Company. The Scots, on the other hand, by way of reprisal, seized a large English vessel, called the AVorcester, which had been driven by a storm into the Frith of Forth. The captain and crew were brought to trial on a charge of having murdered Captain Drummond and the crew of a Scottish vessel connected with the unfortunate colony of Darien, found guilty, on very insuffi cient evidence, and three of them executed. 21. In consequence of these unhappy occun-ences, the animosity between the two nations was inflamed to the highest pitch, and every thing seemed to be tending to an open rapture. It now be came evident to the English statesmen, that, in order to prevent war between the kingdoms, it was indispensably necessary to cany through an incorporating union. Commissioners from both nations were accordingly appointed for the purpose of arranging the pre liminary articles which ought to be adopted as the foundation of the measure. The commissioners assembled, on the 16th of April 1706, in the council-chamber of Whitehall. The Scottish commis sioners proposed a federal union, each kingdom retaining its own parliament, and being subject only to such taxes and other com mercial regulations as the parliaments judged expedient. But the English insisted on an incorporation, which should not afterwards be dissolved by a Scottish parliament. Nothing but this, they said, could ensure a perfect and lasting friendship betwixt the two na tions. The commissioners from Scotland, however, continued to resist the article which subjected the country to the same customs, excises, and regulations of trade, as England; but the queen, being persuaded to pay two visits in person to the commissioners, exerted herself so vigorously, that a majority was at last gained over ; and all the rest yielded, though with reluctance, except Lockhart of Carnwath, who could not, by any means, be persuaded to sign the treaty. 22. The chief provisions of the Union, as finally agreed on, were, that the succession to the throne of the united kingdom should be vested in the Princess Sophia and her heirs, \u2014 that the two coun tries should be governed by the same parliament, \u2014 that all the sub jects of the united kingdom should enjoy a community of rights and privileges, \u2014 that the laws concerning public right, policy, and civil government, should be the same in both countries, \u2014 that Scotland should retain her own national Presbyterian church, her own system"], [257, "A. D. 1706.] 225 ANNE. of civil and municipal laws, and her own courts for the administra tion of justice, \u2014 that all hereditary offices and jurisdictions should continue as formerly, \u2014 that the rights and privileges of the royal burghs of Scotland should remain entire, \u2014 that Scotland should send forty-five members to the united parliament, \u2014 that the Scottish peerage should preserve all the other privileges of their rank, but that only sixteen of their number, chosen by election from the whole body, should enjoy seats in the British House of Lords. No sooner were the articles of union made known, than they were received with the utmost disapprobation in Scotland. The terms of the treaty had been carefully concealed, so that nothing transpired till the whole was at once laid before parliament. But the ferment then became general ; and all ranks and parties, however divided in other re spects, united in opposition to this detested treaty. The nobility and the gentry were exasperated at the annihilation of the parlia ment, and the consequent loss of then influence and credit. The body of the people cried out that the independence of the nation was sacrificed to treachery and corruption, and insisted that the obligation laid on their members, to stay so long in London, in their attendance on the British parliament, would drain the country of its money, impoverish the members themselves, and subject them to the temptations of bribery and corruption. Nor was the com mercial part of the nation better satisfied. The dissolution of the India Company, the taxes laid on the necessaries of life, and the vast number of duties, customs, and restrictions laid upon trade, were all of them matter of complaint. Before this time, Scotland had traded freely to the Levant, the Baltic, France, Spain, Portugal, Holland, and the Dutch plantations ; and it seemed difficult to con ceive how the commerce of the countiy could be advanced, by laying restrictions upon it in regard to these places. The most violent dis putes took place in the parliament. Almost every article of the treaty was the subject of a protest ; and addresses against it were presented to parliament by the Convention of Royal Burghs, the Commission of the General Assembly, and the company trading to Africa and the Indies, as well as from shires, burghs, towns, and parishes, without distinction of Whig or Tory, Presbyterian or Epis copalian. Nor was the resentment of the common people out of doors less violent than that of the members within. A coalition was formed between the Presbyterians and the Cavaliers ; and to such a height did the resentment of the people rise, that they ac tually chose officers, formed themselves into regiments, provided horses and ammunition, burnt the Articles of Union, justified then conduct by a public declaration, and resolved to march to Edin burgh and dissolve the parliament."], [258, "[A. D. 1707. 226 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 23. In the mean time, the privy council issued a proclamation against riots, commanding all persons to retire from the streets whenever the drum was beat, and ordering the guards to fire on those who disobeyed this command. But even these precautions were insufficient. The Duke of Queensberry, the chief promoter of the Union, though guarded by double lines of horse and foot, was obliged to pass through the streets at full gallop, amidst the curses and imprecations of the populace, who pelted his guards, and even wounded some of the persons who attended him in the coach. In opposition to all this fury, the friends of the measure magnified the advantages that would accrue to the kingdom from the Union. They succeeded in abating the resentment of the clergy, by procur ing the insertion of a clause, by which it was made a fundamental article of the Union, that the government of the Church of Scotland, as established at the Revolution, should continue unalterable in all succeeding times. Emissaries were also employed to disunite the Cameronians and the Cavaliers, by demonstrating the absurdity, siufulness, and danger of such a connection. The India Company was flattered with the prospect of an indemnification for the losses it had sustained. A sum, amounting to nearly four hundred thou sand pounds, was advanced by England ; but to be afterwards re paid out of the Scottish revenue. This money was intended to re pay the losses sustained by the Darien Company, to pay arrears of public salaries in Scotland, and to satisfy the claims of individuals for damages arising out of the Union. Thirty thousand pounds of this sum were distributed among the commissioners who drew up the articles of the treaty ; and a farther sum of twenty thousand pounds was employed in bringing over to the measures of the court, a party in the Scottish parliament nicknamed the Squadrons Volante, from their fluctuating between the ministry and the opposition, without attaching themselves to any party, till they should see what line of conduct would best serve their own interest. By this infa mous bargain the ministry obtained a decisive victory, and all op position was henceforth vain. The Articles of Union were ratified by parliament, with some trifling variations, on the 25th of March 1707 ; and on the 22d of April, the Duke of Queensbeny nominally adjourned, but in reality dissolved for ever, that ancient assembly. 24. Although the Union with England was now completed, the Scottish nation continued to regard it with feelings of the deepest discontent. All classes of the community fancied that they saw in the obnoxious measure something hostile to their own interest, and regarded it as fraught with national dishonour. All other distinc tions of party were now merged in the predominant aversion to the Union ; and, as the only way of abolishing it, almost the whole in-"], [259, "A.D. 1714.] ANNE. 227 habitants of Scotland were for a time disposed to join in the resto ration of the Chevalier St George, the son of James H., to the throne of his fathers. Had the exiled prince been able to effect a landing with a sufficient body of troops, the Stewart family might have repossessed themselves of then ancient inheritance. An at tempt of this kind was actually made. A French fleet, having the Chevalier on board, with five or six thousand troops, sailed from Dunkirk on the 17th of March 1708, and reached the Firth of Forth. But on the approach of an English fleet, of much superior force, the French ships took to flight, and returned to Dunkirk. The oppor tunity of striking a successftd blow was thus lost, and never again presented itself. 25. After the Revolution, the adherents of the Episcopal Church had been exposed to considerable annoyance in exercising their form of worship. An effort was now made for their relief. In 1712, an act was passed by parliament for the toleration ef all such Episco pal clergymen as should be disposed to take the oath of abjuration, renouncing all adherence to the cause of the Stewarts. As it was foreseen, however, that the great majority of these clergymen would not abandon their attachment to the exiled family, a clause was craftily introduced into the act, laying upon Presbyterians the same obligation to take the oath of abjuration. This enactment gave great offence to the ministers of the Presbyterian Church, and, as had been expected, many of them refused compliance. The whole of the Episcopal clergy, with one exception, acted in a similar man ner ; but the government gave them no molestation, as a large por tion of the ministers of the Established Church were liable to the same penalty. During the same session of parliament, an act was passed restoring lay patronage in the Chmch of Scotland. This act, which excited universal discontent among the people, was pass ed, in a great measure, by the friends of the Stewart dynasty, with the avowed object of alienating the affections of the people from the existing government, and of rendering the clergy more dependent on the nobility and gentry. 26. During the whole of this period, England was engaged in a protracted and sanguinary continental war, in which the famous Duke of Marlborough gained many remarkable victories. Peace was at length concluded at Utrecht, on the last day of March 1713. The same year was remarkable for an attempt of the Scottish peers and members of parliament to dissolve the union with England, on the ground that it had failed to gain the ends which it was intended to accomplish. The motion was rejected in the House of Lords, by a majority of only four. 27. Queen Anne died on the 1st of August 1714, having lived"], [260, "228 [A. D. 1714.

This princess was fitted rather for the duties of private life than for those of a public station, being a pattern of conjugal affection, a good mother, a warm friend, and an indulgent mistress. She was the last of the lineal race of the Stewarts who sat on the throne of Britain. CHAPTER XXH. A. D. 1714 to 1760. George I. \u2014 George II. CHRONOLOGY OF THE PERIOD. A.B. 1715.

He ascended the British throne in the fifty-fifth year of his age. His accession was in accordance with the wishes of the great body of the people both in Scotland and England ; but the adherents of the exiled family, in both kingdoms, enraged at the disappointment of their fondly cherished hopes, and the impolitic severity which the new whig mi nistry manifested towards their political opponents, resolved upon a general insurrection in behalf of the Stewarts. 2. The rebellion began in Scotland. The Earl of Mar, who had been secretary of state during the last years of the reign of Queen Anne, and had been abruptly and unceremoniously dismissed from office on the accession of King George, assembled three hundred of his vassals and friends in the Highlands, under pretence of a grand hunting match, proclaimed the Chevalier St George at Castleton in Braemar, by the title of James HI., and, displaying the royal Stan-"], [261, "PRINCE CHARLES, a.d. 1745."], [262, ""], [263, "A. D. 1715.] GEORGE I. 229 dard there on the 6th of September 1715, assumed the title of Lieu tenant-General of his majesty's forces. To second these attempts, two vessels arrived from France with arms, ammunition, and a num ber of officers. Mai- soon found himself at the head of ten thousand men, well armed aud provided ; and, having obtained possession of the important town of Perth, where his head-quarters were esta blished, he made himself master of Fife and the whole sea-coast on the north of the Firth of Forth. He then marched to Dunblane as if with the intention of crossing the Forth at Stirling Bridge ; but there he was informed that the Duke of Argyle, who had been ap pointed commander-in-chief of all the royal forces in Scotland, was advancing against him from Stirling with his own clan, assisted by some troops from Ireland. Upon this, Mar at first judged it proper to retreat, but being soon afterwards joined by reinforcements un der the Earl of Seaforth and General Gordon, he resolved to face the enemy, and directed his march towards the south. The Duke of Argyle, apprised of his intentions, resolved to give him battle in the neighbourhood of Dunblane, though his forces did not amount to half the number of the enemy. Accordingly, on the morning of the 13th of November, the duke drew up Iris forces, which did not exceed four thousand men, in order of battle. The left wing of his army was attacked by the centre of Mar's forces, and, after a brief straggle, was completely routed, with considerable slaughter. But Argyle, who commanded in person on the right, attacked the lest wing of the Highlanders, put them to flight, and, diough they often faced about and attempted to rally, he succeeded in driving them back to the river Allan, where they had quartered the night before. The left wing of both armies was thus broken and defeated, and the right of both victorious. But all the advantages of the conflict re mained with Argyle. He had an-ested the progress of the enemy, and, in these circumstances, delay was defeat. In this engagement, which is usually termed the battle of Sheriffmuir, the rebels lost about seven or eight hundred men, including the Earl of Strath more and the young chief of Clan Ranald. On the side of the roy alists, the Earl of Forfar and about five or six- hundred men were slain. 3. After the battle, the Highlanders, according to their invariable practice, returned home in great numbers ; and Mar, seeing his ranks thinned by this desertion, and having, with unpardonable improvi dence, neglected to bring a sufficient stock either of provisions or of ammunition, had no alternative but to lead back his army to its old quarters at Perth. The losses and disappointments of the rebel general continued to increase. The castle of Inverness, of which he had obtained possession, was delivered up by Lord Lovat, who"], [264, "230 [A. D. 1716. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. had hitherto professed to act in the interest of the Chevalier ; and many of the Highlanders, seing no likelihood of coming to a second engagement, returned quietly home. 4. In the mean time, the Jacobites in the north of England had taken up arms, headed by the Earl of Derwentwater and Mr For ster, member of parliament for Northumberland. They were joined by Viscount Kenmure and a small body of horse from the borders of Scotland, and afterwards by a detachment of Highlanders from Mar's army ; but their whole proceedings were marked by a strange infatuation and ignorance of their true position. They were ulti mately invested, in the town of Preston, by General Wills, and compelled to surrender at discretion, on the very day on which the battle of Sheriflmuir was fought. 5. From the time of Mar's retreat to Perth, after the engagement with the royal forces, the ruin of the undertaking was inevitable. But the Chevalier had previously been invited to come over and place himself at the head of the army ; and on the 22d of Decem ber 1715, he landed at Peterhead, with only six gentlemen in his train. At Fetteresso, he was met by the Earl of Mar, with about thirty noblemen and gentlemen. He then proceeded to Dundee, where he made a public entry ; and, in two days more, he arrived at Perth. Here he issued six proclamations, appointing a general thanksgiving for his safe arrival, commanding prayers to be offered up for him in all the churches, summoning together the Scottish Convention of Estates, and appointing a day for his coronation. 6. But while this unhappy prince was thus observing all the ce remonials of royalty, he was without the smallest share of power, and his ill-fated enterprise was fast coming to a close. On the 24th of January 1716, the Duke of Argyle began his -march from Stirling, for the purpose of totally extinguishing the rebellion. On his ap proach the insurgents abandoned Perth, and began their retreat to the north. On their arrival at Montrose, the Chevalier, accom panied by the Earl of Mar, and several noblemen and gentlemen, embarked on board a small French ship that lay in the harbour, and in five days anived at Gravelines. General Gordon performed the melancholy duty of leading the remains of the army to Aber deen, where they dispersed, the Highlanders seeking refuge among their native mountains. The gentlemen and Lowlanders, for the most part, escaped to the Continent. 7. The rebellion being thus ended, the government resolved to put the law in force against such of the insurgents as had fallen in to their power. The Earls of Derwentwater, Nithsdale, Carnwath, and Wintoun, and the Lords Widdrington, Kenmure, and Nairne, were brought to trial, and found guilty. The Earl of Derwentwater"], [265, "A. D. 1724.] GEORGE I. 231 and Viscount Kenmure were executed on Tower Hill ; but Lord Nithsdale, who was destined to a similar fate, had the good fortune to escape in women's clothes, which were brought to him by his lady on the evening before he was to suffer. The Earl of Wintoun, Mr Forster, Brigadier Mackintosh, and several other rebel chiefs, also contrived to make then escape from prison. Of the private persons who had been engaged in the rebellion, twenty-two were executed at Manchester and Preston, while about a thousand were transported to the plantations. 8. In 1717, a scheme for the restoration of the Stewarts was formed by Baron Gorz, the minister of Charles Xn. of Sweden, and countenanced by the Czar Peter, and by Cardinal Alberoni, the minister of the King of Spain. The plan was, that ten thousand Swedish troops, with the king at their head, should be landed in some part of the island, where it was expected they would be joined by all the adherents of the exiled family. But the design was discovered before it was brought to maturity ; and the death of Charles XII. at the siege of Frederickshall in 1718, rendered the scheme completely abortive. 9. Although this undertaking was abandoned, hopes were still entertained that the Chevalier might be restored to the throne of his ancestors by the aid of the Spanish forces. The unfortunate prince was, in 1719, invited to Madrid, and received there with royal honours. A fleet of ten ships of war, having on board six thousand regular troops, with arms for twelve thousand more, was fitted out and placed under the command of the Duke of Ormond. But the elements proved adverse to the expedition. Having pro ceeded as far as Cape Finisterre, the fleet encountered a violent storm, which disabled many of the ships, and drove them back to Spain. Only two frigates, having on board the Marquis of Tulli bardine, the Earl Marischal, and the Earl of Seaforth, with three hundred men, some arms, ammunition and money, anived at then place of destination in the island of Lewis. Here Seaforth raised a few hundred Highlanders, and crossed over to Kintail, where he made some additions to his forces. But he was attacked at a pass called Etrachells, near Glenshiel, by General Wightman, at the head of a body of regular troops, with the Munroes, Rosses, and other Whig clans. The royalists were repulsed with loss ; but Sea forth himself was severely wounded during the engagement, and his troops despairing of success in their enterprise, resolved to disperse during the night. The wounded Earl, with Tullibardine and Ma rischal, escaped to the continent. The three hundred Spaniards next day laid down their arms, and surrendered at discretion. 10. The malt-tax had hitherto been unknown in Scotland, and"], [266, "[A. D. 1736. 232 HISTORT OF SCOTLAND. the people had resisted various attempts to impose it upon them, on the ground that it was contrary to the articles of the Union. At length, in 1724, the House of Commons, in lieu of this tax, im posed a duty of threepence on every barrel of ale in Scotland. The tax was exceedingly unpopular, and contributed, with other causes, to excite a general spirit of discontent throughout the kingdom. At Glasgow, a mob broke open and plundered the house of Mr Camp bell of Shawfield, member for the city, who had voted for the ob noxious duty. Two companies of foot, under Captain Bushell, en deavoured to quell the riot. The mob pelted them with stones, and the captain having ordered his men to fire upon them, nine persons were killed, and many more wounded. But the people, exasperat ed at the fall of then townsmen, drove the soldiers out of the town, and forced them to take refuge in Dunbarton Castle. 11. On receiving intelligence of these disturbances, General Wade, who at that time commanded the forces in Scotland, marched to Glasgow, apprehended some of the rioters, seized the magistrates of the city, and sent them prisoners to Edinburgh castle. They were brought to trial before the Lords of Justiciary, but were declared innocent, and immediately discharged. Captain Bushell, on the other hand, was brought to trial for murder, convicted, and con demned. He received a royal pardon, however, and was even pro moted in the service. The Duke of Roxburgh, who was at that time Secretary of State for Scotland, was dismissed from office, on the suspicion of having encouraged these popular commotions, and the office itself was abolished. 12. On the 11th of June 1727, George I. died, while on a visit to his German dominions. He was in the sixty-eighth year of his age, and thirteenth of his reign. His body was conveyed to Ha nover, and intened among his electoral ancestors. 13. George n. succeeded his father, in the forty-fourth year of his age. The Scottish Jacobites still continued their plots in be half of the exiled family ; but their influence was gradually dimi nishing, as the benefits which Scotland derived from the Union be came more apparent. A remarkable incident, however, which hap pened at this period, served again, for a time, to inflame the popu lar mind against the English government. 14. In the year 1736, two smugglers, of the names of Wilson and Robertson, were condemned to death for robbing the Collector of the Customs in Kirkaldy of a sum of public money, which they had appropriated as a compensation for the great losses they had sus tained by a seizure of smuggled goods. While the criminals were under sentence of death, they were can-ied, according to custom, to church to hear divine service, on the Sabbath before the execution,"], [267, "THE PORTEOUS MOB a.d. 1736"], [268, ""], [269, "A. D. 1736.] GEORGE II. 233 under the custody of four soldiers of the city-guard. Towards the close of the service, AVilson, who was a very powerful man, sud denly grasped a soldier with each hand, seized the collar of a third with his teeth, and called to his comrade to flee for his life. Ro bertson shook himself clear of the remaining soldier, and made his escape. This act of generosity and self-devotion excited a strong feeling in Wilson's favour among the populace of Edinburgh ; and apprehensions were entertained that an effort would be made to rescue him at the place of execution. The sentence of the law, however, was allowed to be executed without interruption ; and it was not till the body of Wilson was cut down, that the mob, ac cording to their usual custom, began to insult the executioner, and to pelt him and the soldiers with stones and mud. Captain Por teous, the commander of the city-guard, was personally obnoxious to the rabble of the city, towards whom he appears to have enter tained a strong dislike. The soldiers under his command seemed to have shared then leader's feelings, and, irritated at the violence and abuse with which they had been treated, they fired upon the mob, and killed and wounded several individuals ; and it was said that Porteous himself took a musket from one of his men, aud fired it at the crowd. In consequence of this proceeding, Porteous was brought to trial for murder, and capitally convicted. King George was at this time on the Continent, and the regency, on learning the circumstances of the case, granted Porteous a reprieve, preliminary to his obtaining a pardon. 15. This step excited general dissatisfaction among the inhabi tants of the metropolis, and a plan was secretly formed for inflict ing upon the unhappy criminal the puuishmeut of his crime. On the evening of the 17th of September, a mob suddenly took pos session of the city gates, and seized and disarmed the guard. They next proceeded to break open the jail in which Porteous was con fined, conveyed him, with the utmost coolness and deliberation, to the place of execution, and hanged him over a dyer's pole. The rioters then quietly dispersed. 16. The Government was exceedingly enraged at this act of vio lence ; and every exertion was made, both by the offer of a large reward, and by the most searching scrutiny, to discover the persons engaged in this outrage, but without success. Not one individual who had taken part in the riot was ever discovered or brought to justice. The affair was brought before Parliament ; and it was re solved to inflict condign punishment on the city of Edinburgh. A bill was accordingly prepared and laid before the legislature, in which it was proposed to abolish the city charter, demolish the city walls, take away the town guard, and declare the provost incapable k 2"], [270, "[A. D. 1745 234 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of holding any office of public trust. The penal clauses of this bill, which were conceived in the most vindictive spirit, were strenu ously resisted by the Scottish members, and in the end withdrawn ; and at length the punishment was restricted to a fine of L. 2000, inflicted on the city for the benefit of Captain Porteous's widow. But unfortunately, a clause was inserted, enjoining the ministers of the Established Church to read a proclamation from their pulpits, once every month during the space of a whole year, calling on the congregations to aid in discovering and bringing to justice the mur derers of Captain Porteous. This clause gave great offence both to the clergy and laity, and was violently resented, as an unwanant able interference, on the part of the state, with the spiritual autho rity of the church. 17. The dispute which arose respecting the propriety of reading the proclamation in the churches, was considerably aggravated, in consequence of its having occurred immediately after the celebrated secession from the Established Church. This event arose indirect ly out of the revival of the law of patronage in 1712. Lay patron age had always been obnoxious to the people of Scotland. One of the first acts of the Scottish Parliament after the Revolution was to abolish it, and the Act of Security was understood to stipulate that it should not be restored. But in little more than five years after the Union, it was re-enacted, and excited great discontent in Scotland, and led to violent disputes among the ministers of the Establishment. At length, on the 16th of November 1733, Eben ezer Erskine and three other ministers were deposed fi-om then offices, and became the founders of the Secession Church. This event excited great agitation among all classes of the community, and has had a most important effect on the spiritual interests of the country. 18. In 1740, a new war broke out with France, which lasted seve ral years. The hopes of the Jacobites revived ; and various schemes were taken into consideration by the French government to aid them in their attempts to restore the exiled family, but they all proved abortive. At length Charles Edward, the eldest son of the Cheva lier St George, determined to undertake an expedition into Scotland upon his own resources, though earnestly dissuaded from it by his adherents, who regarded the attempt as desperate. 19. A man-of-war of sixty guns, named the Elizabeth, was placed at his disposal by Cardinal Tencin, the only member of the French government to whom it is said his resolution was made known ; and, having also obtained the Doutelle, a fast-sailing frigate or sloop-of war, which had been fitted out as a privateer against the English, he embarked on board the frigate, accompanied by the Marquis of"], [271, "A. D. 1745.] GEORGE II. 235 Tnllibardine, Sir Thomas Sheridan, and a few other adventurers. They set sail on the 8th of July 1745 ; but fortune seemed not more propitious to this attempt than to others which had preceded it. The Elizabeth was so much disabled in an engagement with an English man-of-war, on the next day after they lest the port, that she was obliged to return to Brest to refit. The Doutelle, however, continued its course ; and, having nan-owly escaped another Eng lish ship of superior force, at length came to anchor in the bay of Lochnanuagh, between Moidart and Arisaig. There the adventur ous prince landed, accompanied by only seven persons as his suite. After considerable hesitation, he was joined by Clanranald, Lochiel, and other Highland chieftains, who saw clearly the desperate nature of the enterprise, but were induced by a sense of honour and loyalty to join the standard of the prince, in opposition to their better judg ment ; and in a short time Charles found himself at the head of two thousand men. 20. At this critical juncture George H. was absent in Hanover, and the government was in the hands of a Council of Regency. When the authentic report of the commencement of the rebellion reached Edinburgh, it excited great alarm. The regular forces of the country were chiefly on the Continent ; and there were not in Scotland more than three thousand troops, exclusive of garrisons. On the 19th of August, the day on which the standard of Charles was raised in Glenfinnan, Sir John Cope, the commander-in-chief of the forces, set out, at the head of a small body of troops, to oppose the prince, and at once to put an end to the rebellion. On reaching the Highlands, however, and finding the number of the rebels much greater than he had anticipated, he withdrew to Inver ness, thus leaving the road to the low countiy open to the enemy. 21. Charles, availing himself of this blunder of the English gene ral, immediately marched to the south, and took possession of Perth, where he performed the ceremony of proclaiming his father king of Great Britain. He then proceeded towards Edinburgh, which he entered without opposition ; but he was unable to reduce the castle. Here again he proclaimed his father, and promised to dissolve the Union, which was still considered one of the national grievances. 22. In the mean time, Sir John Cope, having marched his troops from Inverness to Aberdeen, embarked them there on board of some transports, and sailed to Dunbar, where he landed his army on the 18th of September, the day after Edinburgh had fallen into the hands of the rebels. The royal forces consisted of about two thou sand infantry, six hundred dragoons, and a number of volunteers. They had six pieces of artillery, but no gunners or artillerymen to work them. At the head of this army, Cope marched from Dunbar,"], [272, "236 [A. D. 1745. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and advanced as far as Haddington, with the view of attempting to rescue the capital from the hands of the enemy. 23. Meanwhile the prince, who had received a reinforcement of five hundred men, under Lord Nairne, resolved to meet Sir John Cope upon his route, and give him battle. The whole Highland army, accordingly, evacuated Edinburgh, and, marching eastward, took post upon the high ground near Tranent. Here they found the royal army encamped, at the distance of less than a mile. Early on the morning of the 21st of September, the Highlanders silently passed a morass which separated the two armies, and attacked the royal forces with the utmost fuiy. A disgraceful panic seized the dragoons, who fled without even an attempt to charge. The infan try stood their ground a little longer, but were irretrievably routed in a few minutes. The victory was in every respect complete. About four hundred, including the brave and pious Colonel Gardi ner, were slain, and upwards of two thousand taken prisoners. Cope's artillery, baggage, and military chest, with L.2500 in specie, fell into the hands of the conquerors. On the part of the Highland ers, four officers and thirty privates were killed, six officers and se venty men wounded. 24. The victory at Prestonpans excited great hopes in the insur gents from the impression it produced ; and, had Charles been in a condition to have followed up the blow by an immediate irruption into England while it was destitute of regular troops, the result might have been fatal to the House of Hanover. But a great num ber of the Highlanders had, according to their uniform custom, re turned home with then plunder, so that his army was reduced near ly one half. At the same time, several British regiments recalled from Flanders, and six thousand Dutch troops, supplied by the States of Holland, had already reached England, and were drawing to a head at Newcastle under Field-Marshal Wade. In these cir cumstances, it would have been madness for the Prince to have ad vanced into England with an army so much diminished in numbers. He was therefore compelled to wait at Edinburgh for the return of the Highlanders, who had gone to deposit their plunder in the mountains ; and, in the meantime, he endeavoured, by every means in his power, to augment his army, and prepare himself for the pro secution of his hazardous adventure. The public money was every where levied, and the utmost exertion was made to collect arms for the complete equipment of his troops. 25. The news of the victory at Prestonpans animated the Jaco bites in every part of the country, aud many who had hitherto re mained neutral, now hastened to join the standard of the prince. Among others, the Earl of Kilinarnock, Lords Balmerino, Cromarty,"], [273, "A.D. 1745.] GEORGE II. 237 Elcho, Ogilvy, and Pitsligo, Macpherson of Cluny, and the eldest son of Lord Lovat, joined the ranks of the rebels, and brought with them considerable reinforcements of troops. Lord Lovat himself was favourably disposed towards their cause, but was unwilling to act openly for fear of the government. Several vessels arrived from France, bringing over some French and Irish officers, and small supplies of money and arms ; and a confidential agent was despatch ed to the French court to urge upon the king and ministry the pro priety of giving effective support to the insurgents by an immediate invasion of Great Britain. 26. Charles, who entertained the most sanguine hopes of being joined by the great body of the English people, was bent upon marching into England by the eastern border, in order to give battle to Marshal Wade. But the members of his council were decidedly opposed to this course, and insisted on remaining in Scotland, at least till his adherents in England should invite him to march into that countiy. After various keen discussions, it was at length re solved to adopt a middle course, and to advance into England by the western frontier. Tins measure, it was expected, would not only avoid a hasty collision with the royal troops which lay on the eastern border, but would also afford an opportunity to then Eng lish friends to rise in arms if they were disposed to take part in the insurrection. 27. On the 31st of October 1745, the Highland army quitted Edinburgh, and marched towards England. It was at this time upwards of 5500 strong, but at least 1000 men deserted before it reached the border. The town and castle of Carlisle sunendered to it after a brief resistance, in which the besiegers had only one man killed aud another wounded. In a council held at Carlisle, the discussions respecting a farther advance into England were renewed, and it was at length resolved to continue the march southwards, as the Prince confidently expected that a powerful party would de clare in his favour in Lancashire, and that a considerable body of French troops would, be landed on the southern coast to create a diversion in his favour. Accordingly, on the 21st of November, the rebels quitted Carlisle, and, advancing through Lancaster and Preston, reached Manchester on the 29th. Here they were joined by between two or three hundred of the populace, who were formed into a regiment under the command of Colonel Townley. Thence they marched to Derby, distant only 127 miles from London, where they rested for nearly two days. 28. The news of the near approach of the Highland army threw the capital into the utmost consternation ; and some have supposed that, if the Prince had marched forward rapidly upon the city, he"], [274, "238 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. [A. D. 1746. might perhaps have made himself master of it. But the chiefs, now fully alive to the desperate nature of their enterprise, were unani mous in their resolution to return to their own countiy. Their situation had, indeed, become in no ordinary degree perilous. At Litchfield, nearly in front, lay the Duke of Cumberland, with an army of at least 8000 men. General Wade was marching through Yorkshire to attack them in the rear. A third army, under the king himself, was rapidly collecting in Middlesex, for the defence of the capital. And while all this was going on there was no appear ance of a rising among the English, or of a descent from France. The farther they advanced, indeed, the people manifested the greater hostility to their cause. In these circumstances, to have continued their march southwards woidd have been an act of insanity, as they must inevitably have been surrounded by three or four armies and cut to pieces. In spite of these considerations, Charles was eager to go forward, but the chiefs insisted on retracing their steps before retreat became impracticable ; and, at length, after in vain attempting to alter their determination, the Prince was compelled to submit to then advice. 29. Accordingly, on the 6th of December, the Highlanders began then retreat northward. At Clifton, near Penrith, they were over taken and attacked by the cavalry of the Duke of Cumberland ; but, after a smart skirmish, the assailants were repulsed with consider able loss. The insurgents were allowed to continue their retreat without farther molestation ; and, on the 20th of December, Charles's birth-day, they crossed the border and re-entered Scotland. March ing northward in three divisions, the Highland army reached Glas gow on the 26th. Here they remained seven or eight days, levying contributions to a large amount. 30. During the absence of Charles in England, Lord John Drum mond had arrived from France, bringing with him some money and military stores, together with the picquets of six Irish regiments, and some Scottish troops in the service of Louis XV. Lord Strath allan lay at Perth at the head of a considerable body of Frasers, Mackintoshes, Mackenzies, and Farquharsons, and Lord Lewis Gordon had made some levies of men and money in Aberdeenshire. The whole of these reinforcements, amounting to upwards of 4000 men, assembled in Perth about the end of December, whence they marched to join the Prince at Stirling. 31. The army of the insurgents being by this junction augmented to 9000 men, it was resolved to lay siege to the castle of Stirling \u2014 a kind of service to which the Highland troops were very unequal. The trenches were opened on the 10th of January 1746, but the eiegc was speedily intemipted by the anlval of General Hawley at"], [275, "A. D. 1746.] 239 GEORGE II. the head of 8000 men. On receiving intelligence of this event, Charles, leaving 1000 men to cany on the blockade of Stirling, drew up his forces about a mile to the east of Bannockburn, ex pecting an attack ; but the royal army remained at Falkirk totally inactive. At length the Highlanders resolved to act on the offen sive, and, on the 17th of January, having succeeded in deceiving their enemies by a stratagem, which concealed their real intentions, suddenly shewed themselves on the eminence called Falkirk Moor, to the left of the royal camp. Hawley was completely taken by surprise, and hastened with his three regiments of dragoons to take possession of the high ground before it should be occupied by the enemy. The Highlanders advanced to the attack with then usual impetuosity, amid a tempest of wind and rain which has seldom been equalled, threw in a well-directed volley, by which the dra goons were completely broken, and then drawing their claymores, rushed forward on then already disordered adversaries. The onset proved nresistible ; infantry and cavalry were intermingled in one common rout. On the right, however, three regiments gallantly stood their ground, and succeeded in repulsing the left of the High landers. The field of battle now presented the singular spectacle of two hostile armies in flight at the same time. The victory, how ever, upon the whole, rested with the rebels ; and the whole artil lery and tents of the royal army fell into their hands. Hawley withdrew, in great disorder, to Linlithgow, and thence next day contiuued his retreat to Edinburgh, leaving behind him about twenty officers, and 400 or 500 privates, killed and wouuded, be sides a number of prisoners. The loss of the insurgents was not considerable. 32. But the victory of Falkirk was the last of the triumphs of the rebel army. The supreme command of the royal forces was now entrusted to the Duke of Cumberland, who reached Edinburgh on the 30th of January, and put himself at the head of the troops as sembled there, amounting to about 14,000 men. On the very day after his arrival he set out in search of the rebels, who had resumed the siege of Stirling \u2014 an enterprise in which they had spent much valuable time to no purpose. 33. On the Duke's approach they raised the siege, and began their retreat to the Highlands, where they spent the winter in dis lodging Lord Loudoun, who commanded for the government in the north, and in reducing the petty forts which were garrisoned by the royal forces. In the meantime, the Duke of Cumberland had fixed his head-quarters at Aberdeen ; and, on the approach of spring, he marched with his army towards Inverness, where Charles had con centrated his forces. On reaching the Spey, a deep and rapid river"], [276, "[A. D. 1746. 240 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the Highlanders exhibited some symptoms of an intention to dis pute his passage ; but they speedily retreated, and suffered the royal army to pass at a narrow and slippery ford without molestation. 34. The mutual contentions of the rebel leaders had now risen to such a height, that they could scarcely agree in anything. At last, however, they resolved to give battle to the royal army ; and for this purpose selected Drammossie Moor, a large heathy flat near Culloden, about nine miles distant from Inverness \u2014 a spot singu larly ill-chosen, as it is almost the only ground in the whole district where cavalry and artillery, which they had most reason to dread, could act with effect against them. The insurgents had only about 6000 men in the battle, opposed to 9000 of the king's troops. An attempt was made by them to surprise the royal army at Nairn, by a rapid night march ; but this having proved abortive, they return ed to their position near Culloden, and drew out to receive the at tack, in very inauspicious circumstances. The royal forces were fresh, vigorous, and well-fed ; while the Highlanders were exhaust ed by fatigue and hunger, and laboured under ever)- kind of disad vantage. 35. At one in the afternoon of the 15th of April the cannonading commenced ; and whilst the artillery of the rebels, from being mi serably served, did little or no execution, that of the royal army a\\ every discharge made frightful gaps in the Highland ranks. Dur ing the continuance of the cannonade, the Duke, observing that the right of the Highlanders was covered by a wall, ordered a body of men to advance and pull it down. The Campbells, to whom this service was committed, promptly obeyed the order ; and the right wing of the Highlanders being thus uncovered, they became ex posed to a fire in flank as well as in front, which was now kept up with the greatest spirit. 36. After the cannonade had continued nearly half-an-hour, the right wing of the Highlanders, unable any longer to sustain the gal ling fire which was poured in on their ranks, and conscious that their real strength lay in close combat, rushed forward through the smoke, and, sword in hand, broke through the front line of their enemies in an instant, and pressed on with diminished numbers, but dauntless resolution, against the second line of the royal army, amidst a concentrated and tenible fire from every gun that could be brought to bear upon them. The second line steadily awaited the onset of this forlorn hope, reserving then fire till it came quite close, when a destructive volley was thrown in ; while Wolfe's regiment, drawn up perpendicular to the general line, opened at the same instant a flanking fire. The force of the charge was thus completely broken ; a few of the bravest who survived the murderous fire, rushed on."], [277, "A. D. 1746.] GEORGE II. 241 and perished in a desperate conflict with the English bayonets. Most of the chiefs who commanded in this part of the battle, and almost every man in the front ranks, were killed. The brave Lochiel, ad vancing at the head of a small band who had survived the encoun ter with the first line, was wounded in both ankles by a grape shot while in the act of charging the second time, and in this state he was canied off the field by his two brothers, between whom he had advanced. 37. While the right wing of the Highlanders was making its gal lant though fatal charge, the Macdonalds, who had always fought on the right wing since the battle of Bannockburn, and now resented as an indignity the post assigned them on the left, seemed uncertain whether they would take part in the engagement or not. At last, after exchanging a volley or two with the right wing of the Duke's army, and answering the fire of some dragoons who hovered near, they retreated, and, separating into small parties, were cut up in detail, losing more men in proportion than the brave band which had made so gallant and vigorous an effort to achieve the fortunes of the day. In less than forty minutes, the battle was lost ; and with it all the hopes of the insurgents were completely overthrown. The conquerors behaved with the most savage cruelty, refusing quarter even to the wounded, the unarmed, and the defenceless. Some were slain who had been only spectators of the combat ; whilst soldiers were seen to anticipate the base employment of the executioner. After the engagement was over, the wounded were collected on the field of battle, dragged out from their hiding places, and put to death in cold blood. The Duke of Cumberland established himself at Fort-Augustus, in the centre of the Jacobite districts, and sent out parties in all directions, who perpetrated the most barbarous cruelties on the defenceless inhabitants ; and in a short time the whole country around became one dreadful scene of plunder, slaughter, and desolation. 38. Immediately after the battle, Charles, accompanied by his immediate councillors and friends, fled straight to Gortuleg, where Lord Lovat was at that time residing. After taking some refresh ment he proceeded to Invergarry, the seat of Glengarry, from which he penetrated into the West Highlands, in the hope of obtaining there more effectual shelter from the pursuit of his enemies. In the meantime, Lord George Murray succeeded in rallying about 1200 men at Ruthven, in Badenoch, many of whom were still anxious to continue the struggle. But the cause was now evidently desperate, and on receiving a letter from the Prince, informing them of his intention to retire to France, they took a melancholy leave of each other, and dispersed. L"], [278, "[A. D. 1746. 242 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 39. Charles was now a proscribed and almost solitary fugitive, exposed to the severest hardships, and to the most imminent perils. Sometimes he found refuge in caves and huts, without any attend ants at all. Sometimes he lay in forests, with one or two com panions of his distress, continually pursued by his enemies, a re ward of L.80,000 having been offered for taking him, either dead or alive. In the course of his romantic adventures, he had occasion to trust his life to the fidelity of hundreds of individuals, many of whom were in the humblest walks of life ; and yet not one of them could be prevailed on, even by so great a reward as that which was offered, to betray him. For five months, the unfortunate adven turer continued to wander through the mountains and seas of the West Highlands, often hemmed round by his pursuers, and in the most imminent peril of being taken, but still rescued, by some pro vidential incident, from the impending danger. In these wanderings he was particularly indebted to the dexterity and courage of a devoted female adherent, named Flora Macdonald. At length a privateer of St Maloes, hired by his adherents, having arrived in Lochnanuagh, he embarked on board that vessel for France. At this time he was reduced to a state of inexpressible wretchedness. His clothes had not been shifted for many weeks ; his eyes were swollen, his visage wan, and his constitution greatly impaired by famine and fatigue. Accompanied by Sullivan and Sheridan, two Irish adherents, who had shared all his calamities, together with Lochiel, young Clanranald, and a few other Mends, he set sail for France, and, after having been chased by two English men-of-war, landed near Morlaix, in Britany, on the 29th of September. 40. While Charles was thus hunted like a beast of prey from covert to covert, the axe and the gibbet were preparing for his brave adherents. Seventeen officers were hanged, drawn, and quartered at Kennington-Common, in the neighbourhood of Lon don. Considerable numbers were executed in the same manner at Carlisle, Penrith, Brampton, and York ; in all about eighty persons suffered with all those circumstances of barbarity awarded by the English law of treason. A few were pardoned, and a considerable number of the common soldiers were transported to America. The Earls of Kilmarnock and Cromarty, and Lord Balmerino, were tried and found guilty of high treason. Cromarty obtained a re prieve, but Kilmarnock and Balmerino were executed, as was also Mr Charles Radcliffe, brother to the last Earl of Derwentwater, who received sentence upon a former conviction. The last victim was Lord Lovat, who was tried, and suffered sometime afterwards. 41. Immediately after the suppression of the Rebellion, the legis lature, in 1747, passed several measures for the purpose of prevent-"], [279, "MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 243 ing any future insuiTection in behalf of the exiled family. The Highlanders had, up till this period, continued to wear the peculiar dress of their ancestors, and never went without arms ; but an act was now passed, not only disarming them, but forbidding, under severe penalties, the use of the Highland garb. In order com pletely to destroy the spirit of clanship, the hereditary jurisdictions which the chiefs and great proprietors exercised over then vassals, were also abolished, and all tenures by wardholding, according to which tenants held lands by performance of military services to their landlords, were declared unlawful. The power of the chiefs was thus completely destroyed, and the essential features of the feudal system for ever abrogated. 42. In October 1748, the war, which had been carrying on for some time on the continent of Europe, was brought to a close by a treaty concluded at Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, hostilities again broke out between France and Britain. At their commencement the English were unsuccessful ; but under the brilliant administra tion of the illustrious Pitt, Earl of Chatham, the aspect of affairs speedily changed. In America, after various other successes, the French were defeated in the neighbourhood of Quebec by the cele brated General Wolfe, who, to the great regret of the British nation, fell in the action. The surrender of the town was the consequence of this victory, and it was soon followed by the cession of all Canada. In Germany, the allies, under the command of Prince Ferdinand of Branswick, defeated the enemy at Crevelt, in 1758 ; and, in 1759, inflicted upon them a still more humiliating overthrow at Minden. In the East, conquests of astonishing magnitude were achieved ; and, in the short space of a few years, the English everywhere sub dued their opponents, and founded a mighty empire in Hindostan. In the midst of these splendid successes, George H. died suddenly, on the 25th of October 1760. He was in the seventy-seventh year of his age, and the thirty-third of his reign. CHAPTER XXHI. Manners and Customs of the People. 1. In the Lowlands of Scotland, a great improvement had taken place since the close of the seventeenth century. At that period there was, according to Fletcher of Saltoun, \" in Scotland (besides a great number of families very meanly provided for by the church-"], [280, "244 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. boxes, with others, who, with living upon bad food, fall into various diseases) 200,000 people begging from door to door. These are not only in noways advantageous, but a very grievous burden to so poor a country ; and though the number of them be perhaps double to what it was formerly, by reason of the present great distress, yet, in all times, there have been about 100,000 of these vagabonds, who have lived without any regard or submission either to the laws of the land, or even those of God and nature. No magistrate could ever discover or be informed which way any of these wretches died, or that ever they were baptized. Many murders have been disco vered among them ; and they are not only a most unspeakable op pression to poor tenants (who, if they do not give bread, or some sort of provision, to perhaps forty such villains in one day, are sure to be insulted by them), but they rob many poor people who live in houses distant from any neighbourhood. In years of plenty, many thousands of them meet together in the mountains, where they feast and riot for many days ; and at country weddings, markets, burials, and other the like public occasions, they are to be seen, both men and women, perpetually drunk, cursing, blaspheming, and fighting together.\" 2. Such was the state of Scotland at the end of her religious wars and persecutions, when the Act for the establishing of parochial schools was repealed, and the ministry of the gospel suspended throughout all her parishes. But no sooner did the people obtain repose from the violent dissensions by which the countiy had been convulsed, and the parochial system of education become again general, than these disorders subsided, extreme destitution rapidly disappeared, and mendicity, though it still subsisted, was confined within com paratively narrow limits. So rapidly did this transformation take place, that De Foe, giving an account of the condition of the coun try in 1717, states that \" the people are restrained in the ordinary practice of common immoralities, such as swearing, drunkenness, slander, and the like. As to theft, murder, and other capital crimes, they come under the cognisance of the civil magistrate, as in other countries ; but in those things which the church has power to punish, the people being constantly and impartially prosecuted, they are thereby the more restrained, kept sober, and under government ; and you may pass through twenty towns in Scotland without see ing any broil, or hearing one oath sworn in the streets ; whereas, if a blind man was to come from there into England, he shall know the first town he sets his foot in within the English border, by hear ing the name of God blasphemed and profanely used, even by the very little children on the street.\" 3. The striking change that had thus taken place-in the character"], [281, ".MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 245 and habits of the people, is to be attributed principally to the com- bined influence of the parochial schools, and of the teaching and superintendence of the clergy. Education was generally diffused throughout the community. Persons were rarely to be met with, even in the lower ranks of life, without the knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic. To have a relative unable to read, would have been reckoned disgraceful to a whole family. The duties of family worship and domestic instruction of the young in the principles of religion, were generally attended to ; and the Bible formed part of the library of almost every family. The favourite literature of the peasantry consisted of such theological treatises as the Marrow of Modern Divinity, Boston's Fourfold State, The Cloud of Witnesses, Howie's Scotch AVorthies, and other similar records of the sayings and doing3 of those stern Presbyterians, who, during the fierce storm of persecution, had been driven from their churches, and compelled to flee, with their flocks, to the caves and dens of the mountains. The characters of these old champions of the Covenant were regarded with unbounded veneration ; and the traditionary narratives of their struggles and sufferings were handed down from father to son with devout admiration, and exercised a most important influence upon the opinions and manners of the people. 4. The duties of the Sabbath were performed with exemplary care. It is recorded, that, even in the populous town of Paisley, the inhabitants were so universally regular in their attendance at church, and strict afterwards in keeping within doors, that, down to the close of the eighteenth century, scarcely a single individual was ever seen walking the streets after divine service. In Glasgow, the people were equally strict in their observance of the sacred day. \" There were families who did not sweep or dust the house, or make the beds, or allow any food to be cooked or dressed on Sunday. There were some who opened only as much of the shutters of their windows, as would serve to enable the inmates to move up and down, or an individual to sit at the opening to read.\" 5. It cannot be denied that a good deal of asceticism mingled with the religion of this period, and that the fiery trials through which the people had passed, had given a somewhat stern and gloomy cast to the national manners and feelings, especially in con nection with their religious opinions. Ecclesiastical discipline, too, was wielded with excessive rigour. Standing in companies on the street, holding idle discourse there, taking recreation by walking through fields and meadows, giving and receiving visits, were all reckoned offences deserving of church censure. In accordance with these principles, the magistrates in most of the large towns em-"], [282, "246 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ployed officers, termed \" Seizers\" or \" Compurgators,\" to perambu late the city on the Saturday nights, and when, at the approach of twelve o'clock, they happened to hear any noisy conviviality going on, even in a private dwelling-house, enter to it without ceremony, and dismiss the company. Another office of these \" seizers\" was to perambulate the streets and public walks during the time of divine service on Sunday, and to apprehend all loiterers and evil-doers. 6. Among the rural population, and in the small towns, this ri gorous discipline seems to have been patiently submitted to ; but in the large towns, and especially in the metropolis, the authority of the church was set at defiance by a class of the community, who were all the more reckless and daring in consequence of the exces sive strictness with which ecclesiastical censures were administered. Midnight riots in the streets were of common occurrence. Drunken ness, too, was a vice that prevailed to a great extent. In Edin burgh, no inconsiderable part of the business of life was carried on in taverns and public-houses ; and there lawyers, merchants, and tradesmen might be seen regularly settling their affairs with then clients and customers over plentiful libations of strong liquors. A similar custom prevailed in Glasgow, where no business was trans acted but in the wine-shops opposite to the Tontine Exchange. In both cities, dinner parties and other social entertainments usually terminated with hard drinking; and gentlemen were to be met with, in a state of intoxication, at most evening parties, and in all public places. 7. The domestic accommodations of the Scottish people at this period, were of a veiy limited and inconvenient kind. Even in Edinburgh the residences of the higher classes were small, gloomy, and ill ventilated. The streets were very narrow, and the houses raised to an enormous height, not unfrequently affording shelter to twenty or thirty families within then walls. Edinburgh, at that time, enjoyed the unenviable distinction of being reckoned the fil thiest city in Europe. The streets, especially in the morning, were covered with all kinds of abomination ; and the pigs, which many of the inhabitants kept under the outside stairs that projected from the houses, wandered about unrestrained, and played the part of scavengers. In the rural districts, the internal arrangements of the houses were at least equally inconvenient, and the same disregard of cleanliness and comfort was everywhere manifested. With re gard to diet, the Scots had now, to a great extent, adopted the cus toms of their English neighbours. Tea was introduced into Scot land in 1681 ; and, about the middle of the eighteenth century, it had come into common use among the middle classes of the metro polis. The dinner hour was two o'clock. Tea was served at four,"], [283, "MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 247 and hence this meal was usually termed the \" four hours.\" The intercourse of society was principally by evening parties. 8. The prosperity of the agricultural population was greatly re tarded by the law which vested the administration of justice in the landed proprietors. By means of then hereditary jurisdictions, the barons and chiefs possessed the power of judging both in civil and criminal cases among their dependents. In all law-suits between landlord and tenant, the former was thus constituted the judge in his own cause. Such a state of things, it is scarcely necessary to say, was often productive of great oppression and injustice. The nature of the engagements between the proprietor and his tenantry also tended greatly to keep the latter in a state of poverty and de pendence. The farms were usually held from year to year. Little of the rent was paid in money : and the tenants were, in almost eveiy case, bound to grind their corn at the baron's mill, paying, of course, a much larger sum for the operation than they would have done elsewhere ; and to perform field-work and other similar la bours for the proprietor, while the cultivation of their own farms was left in anear. 9. The patrimonial estates of the gentry were inherited by their eldest sons, who were not unfrequently devoted to the law or the sword. The younger sons' usually sought their fortunes abroad. Not a few of them entered into the service of foreign potentates ; and, during the thirty years' war in Germany, Gustavus Adolphus had in his army four lieutenant-generals, twenty colonels, and an immense number of inferior officers, who were all natives of Scot land. At a later period, it was no uncommon thing for the younger sons of noble families to be instructed in some mechanical art. Some sought opportunities of advancement in England ; others in the colonies, where they were, in many cases, successful in acquir ing considerable wealth. 10. The Highlands continued in a semi-barbarous state, and the inhabitants presented a striking contrast to the Lowlanders in dress, language, manners, and customs. Civilization, however, had not been without its influence, even on these rude mountaineers ; but the essential features of the peculiar system under which they were placed, still remained the same. The patriarchal form of govern ment was still displayed among them in a state almost entire. Their community, which consisted of about 100,000 souls, or a twelfth of the whole population of Scotland, was divided into about forty different clans. At the head of every clan was the chief, who was the general of the tribe in war, their magistrate and judge in peace. Next in the order of rank were the duinhe wassails or gen tlemen, who were related to the chief, and, in consequence of that"], [284, "248 HISTORY OF SCOTT.AND. relation, were treated with much greater deference than the rest of the clan, who were a race of mere serfs. As the power of these chieftains, in an age when might made right, necessarily depended on the number of their adherents, it was their constant object, by every possible means, to swell the ranks of their retainers. \" I can raise five hundred men,\" was the laconic reply of MacDonald of Keppoch to an English guest, who inquired the amount of his in- come. Hence the population of these mountainous districts was continually increasing beyond the means of subsistence ; and the estates \" or countries,\" as they were called, of the chiefs, were over- ran by an idle, haughty, and turbulent race, who despised all peace- ful modes of support, and acknowledged no law except the command of then leader. The hereditary feuds which many of the clan3 car- ried on against each other, combined, with the circumstances al- ready mentioned, to keep alive among them the use of arms long after the rest of their countrymen had converted their swords into ploughshares. It is to these peculiar habits and dispositions of the Highlanders, that we are to look for an explanation of the readi- ness and zeal with which the cause of the exiled family was em- braced by the chiefs and their followers, as well as of the success that attended their arms during the early part of the rebellion of 1745. The chiefs, who were on many grounds strongly attached to the cause of the Stewarts, looked forward with sanguine expec- tations to the honours which they were certain to receive, if, through their exertions, the exiled family should again be restored to the throne of their ancestors. The ideas of government entertained by the primitive race over whom they ruled, disposed them to look upon these unfortunate princes as the general fathers or chiefs of the nation, whose natural and unquestionable power had been re- belliously disputed by then children. Their sympathies were strongly awakened by the romantic and hazardous nature of the enterprise in which Charles was engaged, as well as by the generous confidence with which he threw himself among them for support ; while the devoted attachment to their chiefs made them at all times ready to fight in any quarrel which they might adopt. Thus honour, \" loyalty unlearned,\" sympathy, and even what was in their esti mation patriotism, all combined with various meaner motives to induce this brave and high-spirited race to embrace, with the most enthusiastic devotion, the cause of the heir of their ancient kings."], [285, "249 CHAPTER XXTV.

George H. was succeeded by his grandson George HI., who ascended the throne in the twenty-third year of his age, and, in the following year, manied the Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg- Strelitz. The young king was for some time entirely under the in fluence of his mother and her favourite, the Earl of Bute ; and the consequences of the unbounded control which they exercised over his mind soon became apparent. At the first council held by the king, Bute was not only sworn a member of the privy council, but introduced into the Cabinet ; and it was speedily made evident, that the Court had determined to break np the whig party, which had governed the countiy since the accession of the house of Hano ver, and to destroy the power of the ministry. 2. The appearance of a negotiation for peace had for some time been kept up among the belligerent powers of Em-ope ; but the French were not sincere in their proposals, as they expected to draw Spain into a confederacy with them ; and soon after, a secret treaty, known as the Family Compact, was concluded between these two powers, in which they virtually bound themselves to make common war on England. The existence of this treaty was speedily discovered by Pitt. With his characteristic promptitude and energy, he at once proposed to declare war against Spain, and to intercept the American fleet, as it was known that Spain had postponed the declaration of hostilities only till the treasure-ships should have arrived. Bute, and the greater part of the cabinet, united in rejecting this wise and resolute counsel ; and Pitt imme diately resigned his office."], [286, "[A. D. 1763. 250 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 3. It was soon found, however, that the Great Commoner, as Pitt was usually termed, was in the right. A war with Spain proved to be inevitable. The American fleet, which he had proposed to inter cept, unloaded an immense cargo of bullion in the harbour of Cadiz. In 1762, France and Spain, in the most nefarious manner, jointly declared war against Portugal our ally, because the Portuguese mo narch refused to accede to the confederacy against Britain. The in roads of three Spanish armies, however, into Portugal were attend ed with little success ; and in America and the East Indies, the Bri tish arms met with an almost unbroken series of victories. The islands of Martinico, St Lucia, St Vincent, and Grenada, were taken from the French ; and the strong fortress of Havannah, in the island of Cuba, was taken from the Spaniards. Here, too, the fleets assembled from the several parts of the Spanish West Indies, were all taken or destroyed. The value of the spoil which fell into the hands of the victors, did not fall short of three millions sterling. To this success may be added, the capture of the Spanish register ship called the Hermione, just as she was entering one of the ports of Old Spain. The prize was valued at about one million sterling. Soon after Manilla capitulated, and fourteen considerable islands in the East Indies fell into the hands of the British. During this time, the war in Germany had continued to rage with the utmost violence, but no decisive advantage had been obtained by either party. 4. Conquests so extensive and ruinous to the French and Spa niards, naturally rendered them desirous of peace, which was at length concluded at Paris on the 10th of February 1763. England withdrew, not without dishonour, from her German connections. The terms of accommodation were advantageous to this countiy ; but less so than might have been expected from a long series of the most splendid victories by land and sea, in every part of the world. On this account, and also in consequence of the unpopularity of the government by whom it was negotiated, the treaty of peace became exceedingly odious to the people. A torrent of obloquy was pour ed forth, in an especial manner, against the Earl of Bute, who had now become prime minister in name as well as in reality ; but, by means of intimidation and corruption, a large majority of both houses of parliament was gained over to approve of the treaty. 5. In spite of this temporary triumph within the walls of the House of Commons, the popular clamour against Bute continued to rage as fiercely as before. The obnoxious favourite was a Scotch man, and the spirit of party animosity was, in consequence, render ed more malignant by the revival of the ancient national grudge of the English against the Scotch. The most rancorous and auda cious libels on the court and on the minister appeared daily, both in"], [287, "A. D. 1763.] GEORGE III. 251 prose and verse. In the midst of this general ferment, the Earl of Bute unexpectedly resigned his office ; and George Grenville became first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the Exchequer. 6. He began by making war on the press. A weekly paper, call ed The North Briton, had for some time been conspicuous for the audacity of its assaults upon the ministers ; and it was resolved that then authority should no longer be braved with impunity. One particular paper, supposed to be written by John Wilkes, member for Aylesbury, was selected for prosecution. AVilkes was appre hended under what was termed a general wan-ant, which did not mention his name, and committed to the Tower with circumstances of unusual severity. The Court of Common Pleas decided that the arrest of Wilkes was illegal, and that Iris privilege as a member of parliament had been infringed ; and he was accordingly set at li berty. 7. At this period the ministry passed an act for imposing stamp duties on the North American colonies. This step excited the deepest indignation among the Americans, who regarded taxation without representation as tyranny ; and, in the end, they were led to renounce altogether their dependence on Britain. The ministers had rendered themselves odious to the king by then harsh and im perious conduct ; and Pitt having refused to take office, his majesty was reluctantly obliged to accept a 'Whig administration, with the Marquis of Rockingham at its head. 8. Meanwhile, the consequences of the attempt to raise a reve nue from the American colonies were eveiy day becoming more alarming. The colonists were in a state bordering on rebellion ; and as large sums were due by them in Britain, the inten-uption of the commerce between the provinces and the mother country threat ened many merchants with bankruptcy. The king and the late mi nisters were bent upon enforcing the stamp act by the sword. A fierce struggle took place in parliament ; but, in spite of the oppo sition of Grenville and hi3 adherents, and the insidious hostility of the king, the administration obtained a repeal of the obnoxious law, coupled, however, with the assertion, that the legislative authority of the British parliament over the whole empire was, in all cases, supreme. His majesty's dislike to his ministers continued unabated ; and, shortly after the close of the session of parliament, Lord Rock ingham received his dismissal, but not before he had succeeded in putting a final stop to the use of general warrants, and to the seiz ure of papers in cases of libel. 9. The public excitement arising from all these events was in creased by the return from exile of John Wilkes, who, outlaw as he was, offered himself a candidate, first for the city of London, and"], [288, "[A. D. 1776. 252 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND afterwards for Middlesex, and, amidst tumults and riots, which seemed to threaten a civil war, was chosen knight of the shire for that county. The House of Commons, to notify the inveterate hatred of the court, declared him incapable of sitting in parliament ; but he was again and again returned, till at length the House, by a most unwarrantable stretch of authority, declared his opponent Colonel Luttrell duly elected. 10. The attempt to augment the revenue, by taxing the Ameri can colonies, had been resumed by the government, in spite of the warning given by the excitement which the stamp act had produced. The Americans, however, were determined to resist all attempts at taxation for the benefit of the mother country, and the aspect of affairs soon became gloomy and terrible. Oppression provoked riots and tumults, and these were made the pretext for fresh op pression. In vain were the ministers warned of the inevitable re sult of their absurd and arbitrary measures. They obstinately per severed in the course on which they had entered ; and, on the 19th of April 1775, began the fatal contest by which the commonwealth was torn asunder. 11. The war was earned on for some time with varied success. The Americans succeeded in dislodging the British troops from Bos ton, in March 1776. On the other hand, they not only lost the town of New York, but sustained such a defeat as seemed to threat en their affairs with total ruin. The campaign of 1776 appeared so decisive, that the cause of the Americans was generally regarded as desperate. The colonists, however, who had, on the 4th of July 1776, declared their independence, resolutely earned on the con test, and even, at the moment of their greatest depression, refused the offers made to them by the British government. The tide soon began to turn in their favour : their famous general, Washington, obtained various successes over the British troops, and the German mercenaries who had been hired to assist them ; and the disaster of General Burgoyne at Saratoga \u2014 where a British army, exhausted, famished, and harassed on every side by a hostile peasantry, was compelled to deliver up its arms \u2014 reduced the ministry to the ut most perplexity, and the nation almost to despair. 12. Concessions were now offered to the colonists, which, if granted in time, would have prevented all the mischief that had happened ; but they were now too late, and were at once rejected by the American Congress. The European governments which Britain had in the late war so signally humbled, received the news of the disaster at Saratoga with undisguised exultation. Numbers of the French nobility and officers entered the American armies, and were of essential service to the cause of the insurgents ; and at"], [289, "A. D. 1778] GEORGE HI. 253 length, in 1778, the independence of the United States was openly recognised, iu the most insulting manner, by the French court. War with France became, of course, inevitable. A French fleet, under the command of Count d'Estaing, sailed to the assistance of the insurgent colonists, and took the islands of St Vincent and Gre nada. The island of Dominica also fell into the hands of the enemy. On the 27th of July 1778, the principal French fleet, under Count d'Orvilliers, encountered in the English Channel the British fleet under Admiral Keppel, but without any decisive result. In the following year, Spain joined the general confederacy against Britain. 13. At this period, the public tranquillity was disturbed, and the safety of the state endangered, by an outbreak of popular fury against the Roman Catholics. Some of the disqualifications, under which the professors of the Roman Catholic faith laboured iu Eng land, having been removed by parliament, those of the same per suasion in Scotland were encouraged to hope for a similar relief. The design was approved of by the General Assembly of the Chinch of Scotland, and notice had been given that a bill to rescind the penal statutes against the Catholics would be brought into parlia ment. But the proposal met with the most furious opposition. An association was formed in Edinburgh under the title of \" The Com mittee for the Protestant Interest,\" which carried on a correspond ence with all those throughout the countiy who were hostile to the intended measure. The greatest excitement prevailed on the sub ject. On the 2d of February 1780, the populace of Edinburgh, among whom the prejudice against the removal of the penal statutes was veiy violent, attacked and burnt the house in which the Ro man Catholic bishop and others of his persuasion resided, together with a place of worship adjoining ; and having in the same manner destroyed another house, which also contained a chapel, they pro ceeded to wreak their vengeance on the houses of Principal Robert son and Mr Crosbie, an eminent advocate, whom they suspected of' favouring the Catholic claims. But the friends of these distinguished individuals took precautions for then protection, and the military were called in, by whose aid order was at length restored. The contagion soon spread to London, where a Protestant association was also formed, at the head of which was Lord George Gordon, who had rendered himself conspicuous in Scotland by his opposition to the removal of the Roman Catholic disabilities. A petition to parliament, praying for the repeal of the law passed in 1778, in fa vour of the Catholics, having been prepared and signed, it is said, by 120,000 persons, Lord George, on the 2d of July, proceeded to the house of parliament, at the head of fifty or sixty thousand per-"], [290, "254 [A. D. 1780. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. sons, for the purpose of presenting it. He insisted that it should be considered without delay, but found only six members to support his motion. 14. In the mean time, the populace had with difficulty been pre vented from breaking open the doors of the house, and, as soon as an adjournment took place, they proceeded to demolish the Roman Catholic chapels belonging to the foreign ambassadors. The riots continued for several days, during which the city was entirely at the mercy of the mob. The Romish chapels, Newgate, the King's Bench and Fleet prisons, and a number of houses belonging to Ro man Catholics, were burnt to the ground. On the night of the 7th of June, not fewer than twenty-six fires were seen burning at the same time. During that evening, however, large bodies of troops arrived in town, and, falling upon the rioters wherever they ap peared, killed and wounded great multitudes of them. On the af ternoon of the 8th, tranquillity was restored, but not before 458 persons had been killed and wounded, exclusive of those who pe rished from intoxication. Lord George Gordon was an-ested and committed to the Tower, where he remained till the 5th of February 1781, when he was tried on a charge of high treason, but acquitted. 15. Meanwhile the war continued to rage, both with America and with France and Spain. On the 8th of January 1780, Admiral Rodney, who was proceeding to the relief of Gibraltar, then be sieged by the Spaniards, fell in with twenty-two sail of Spanish ships, and captured the whole fleet. On the 16th of the month, he engaged near Cape St Vincent with another Spanish fleet, and cap tured four of their largest ships, and canied them into Gibraltar. In the month of June, Admiral Geary took twelve valuable mer chant ships belonging to France ; but this success was more than counterbalanced by the loss of a fleet of merchantmen bound for the East and West Indies, which was captured by the combined fleets of France and Spain. This prize, however, scarcely compensated the Spaniards for the loss of Fort Omoa, which, together with an immense booty, fell into the hands of the British. On the 15th of August, Lord Comwallis signally defeated the American general, Gates, with the loss of 900 killed and 1000 made prisoners. In the year 1780, a most formidable confederacy of the European powers, under the title of the Armed Neutrality, was entered into, with the design of crashing the power of Britain. The principle on which the coalition was formed went to authorise neutral states to carry on their usual commercial intercourse with belligerents, except in contraband goods. During the whole contest with the Americans, the Dutch had acted a most perfidious part ; and, shortly after the announcement of the Armed Neutrality, war was declared against"], [291, "A. D. 1782.] george in. 255 them, in consequence of the discovery that the town of Amsterdam was about to enter into a commercial treaty with America. On the 2d of February 1781, the Dutch island of St Eustatia was taken by Admiral Rodney, together with 250 ships, and other booty, es timated at three millions sterling. The colonies of Demcrara and Essequibo also fell into the hands of the British. On the 5th of August, a desperate engagement took place off Dogger Bank, be tween a Dutch fleet under Admiral Zoutman, and a British fleet under Sir Hyde Parker. Both sides claimed the victory. In Ame rica, the British arms met with great disasters. Colonel Tarleton was defeated by the colonists under General Morgan ; and on the 19th of October, Lord Comwallis, after a gallant defence, was forced to surrender Yorktown, with the whole of his arniy, to General Washington, and the vessels in the harbour to the French admiral, De Grasse. 16. These accumulated disasters rendered evident the necessity of putting an end to a contest so calamitous and destructive. It is now well known that the war was persevered in by the ministry, in obedience to the wishes of the king, much longer than it would otherwise have been. But the contest had now become hopeless. Britain was carrying on a bloody and expensive war single-handed against the united forces of France, Spain, Holland, and America. The countiy was impoverished, the state of the finances was most deplorable, and peace had become so manifestly desirable, that, in spite of the earnest wishes of the king, the ministry refused to con tinue the struggle longer. A new administration, at the head of which was the Marquis of Rockingham, was therefore formed in March 1782, for the purpose of bringing the war to a close. In the mean time, the Spaniards and French had met with various suc cesses in the West Indies, and nothing less was contemplated by them than the entire reduction of the British West India Islands. But on the 12th of April, Admiral Rodney, after an engagement which lasted from seven in the morning till sunset, completely de feated the French admiral, De Grasse, and captured seven ships of the line and two frigates, including the admiral's own ship, the Vine de Paris, of 112 guns. This great victory ruined the naval power of France and Spain, and gave a finishing blow to the war. The famous siege of Gibraltar, which had lasted for three years, was brought to a termination in the month of September following, all the efforts of the united forces of France and Spain to obtain pos session of that fortress having completely failed. 17. All parties now felt that it was high time to put an end to the contest, and negotiations for a general peace were commenced at Paris. Before these could be brought to a termination, the Mar-"], [292, "[A. D. 1783. 256 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. quis of Rockingham died, and was immediately succeeded by Lord Shelburne, as first lord of the treasury. This arrangement proved so disagreeable to some of his colleagues, that Mr Fox, Lord John Cavendish, Mr Burke, Mr Sheridan, and several others, immediately resigned. The chancellorship of the exchequer was bestowed on Mr William Pitt, the younger son of the late Lord Chatham, whom Lord Shelburne had found means to attach to his interest. No ob struction, however, was offered to the general pacification ; and, on the 30th of November 1782, the articles of a provisional treaty were settled between Britain and America, and on the 20th of January following, they were ratified by France and Spain. The indepen dence of the Thirteen United States was acknowledged, and it was stipulated that they should enjoy a full participation in the fisheries on the banks of Newfoundland and in the Gulf of St Lawrence. Great Britain restored to France the island of St Lucia, the settle ments of Goree and Senegal, and Pondicheny, with other conquests in the East, and, at the same time, relinquished all claims on Dun kirk. France gave up all her West India conquests except Tobago. Spain was allowed to retain Minorca and West Florida, East Flo rida being also ceded in exchange for the Bahamas. A suspension of hostilities with Holland was agreed to, but the preliminaries of peace were not signed till September 1783. Thus an end was pnt to the most dangerous war in which Britain had ever engaged, and out of which, notwithstanding the powerful combination against her, she became superior to all her enemies. 18. No sooner were the articles of peace ratified and laid before parliament, than they excited the most vehement declamations against the ministry. A coalition was formed between Lord North and the Whigs who had seceded from the administration on the appoint ment of Lord Shelbume to the office of prime minister, and, as the combined parties formed a majority in parliament, they succeeded in forcing the ministry to resign. On the 2d of April 1783, a new administration was formed of the parties who had driven Lord Shelburne from power. But the triumph of the coalition was short lived. In the month of November following, a bill for regulating the affairs of the East India Company was brought into parliament by Mr Fox, which excited violent opposition. It passed the House of Commons, however, by a great majority ; but, in consequence of the hostility of the king and his friends, it was rejected in the House of Lords on the 17th of December, and on the 18th, at midnight, the ministry were most unceremoniously dismissed from office. A new administration was speedily formed, at the head of which was the celebrated William Pitt. For some time, the opposition having a majority in the lower house, employed all their resources in a"], [293, "A. D. 1788.] GEORGE IU. 257 fruitless attempt to drive the young premier from office ; but the parliament having been dissolved in March 1784, the ministry ob tained a great majority in the new elections. Iu 1786, begau the famous trial of Wan-en Hastings before the House of Lords, for his conduct in India, which, after lasting eight years, ended in his acquittal. 19. In the autumn of 1788, symptoms of mental derangement having appeared in the king, great discussion took place with re spect to the mode of meeting the emergency. Mr Fox and his friends contended, that the heir-apparent to the crown being of full age, had the same right to the exercise of the executive power as in the event of the king's death. Mr Pitt, on the other hand, affirmed that the Prince of Wales had no more claim to the regal functions than any other person, and that it devolved entirely on the two remaining branches of the legislature to supply the tem porary chasm in the third estate. Resolutions in accordance with these opinions were canied by a great majority, in both Houses of Parliament ; and a bill was introduced, appointing the Prince of Wales regent, under certain restrictions : but before it could be carried into operation, it was rendered unnecessary by the recovery of the king, which was publicly announced on the 19th of February 1789. 20. At this period an extraordinary revolution broke out in France, where the people had long been grievously oppressed by the court and the nobility. At length, the government became unable to restrain the violence of the popular commotions, and the most dreadful convulsions speedily took place. The institutions of the country were entirely subverted. The monarchy, the order of nobility, the church, the corporations, laws, judicial establishments, and local boundaries, were swept away in rapid succession. At the commencement of the revolution, the efforts of the people to abate the enormous evils under which they had long groaned, were viewed with general approbation in England ; but when they pro ceeded to subvert the entire constitution, and to subject the king and royal family to great indignities and insults, public opinion underwent a decided change. A division took place in the Whig party, in consequence of the opposite views adopted by some of their most eminent leaders respecting the nature of the French revolution. It was warmly eulogized by Mr Fox, and strongly re probated by Mr Burke ; and, after several angry altercations, the latter separated himself entirely from his former political associates, and gave his strenuous support to the measures adopted by the ad ministration. 21. The sweeping changes that were taking place in France ex- L2"], [294, "[A. D 1794. 258 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. cited great alarm in the minds of the various monarchs of Em-ope, lest the example should be imitated by their own subjects ; and a combination was formed among them, to restore the French mo narchy and nobility to their former condition. A manifesto was issued by the emperor of Austria and the king of Prussia, declaring then intention to restore the ancient order of things in France ; and the Duke of Brunswick, the commander of the combined army, advanced into the heart of the country, with the view of marching to Paris, and restoring the royal authority. This fatal step preci pitated the downfal of the monarchy. As the restoration of absolute power was made the excuse for a hostile invasion, it was considered dangerous to entrust the national defence to the hands of the king. The unhappy monarch was, therefore, dethroned. Paris became the scene of the most dreadful crimes. The king and queen were brought to the scaffold. Many innocent persons, who were accused or suspected of adhering to the royal cause, were murdered in cold blood, and the capital was deluged with blood. 22. In the meantime, the combined army continued its march into France, and at first met with considerable success. But the French nation offered the most enthusiastic opposition to this aggression on its territory. The revolutionary forces soon compelled the invaders to retreat, became in their turn the assailants, and gained various important advantages over their enemies. 23. Soon after the murder of Louis XVI., which took place on the 21st of January 1793, Britain took part with the allied states in carrying on the sanguinary and eventful war which was then desolating Europe, and in which its whole powers, excepting Rus sia, Sweden, and Denmark, were actively engaged. At sea, where her strength could be most effectually exerted, Great Britain was eminently successful ; and, on the 1st of June 1794, Lord Howe obtained a signal victory over the French fleet near Brest. But in the Netherlands, on the Upper Rhine, and on the frontiers of Italy and Spain, the French armies were everywhere victorious. Holland fell completely into their power, and was erected into a republic ; while the stadtholder escaped in a fishing- boat to England, where he and his family were treated with the respect due to their rank and misfortunes. 24. Meanwhile the war with France had become exceedingly un popular in Britain. Great discontent was excited throughout the country with the course which the ministry were pursuing ; and ef forts were, in consequence, made by many influential individuals to obtain a reform in parliament. Vigorous steps were taken by government to suppress these proceedings. Several booksellers in England were prosecuted, and punished with imprisonment, for sell-"], [295, "A. D. 1796.] GEORGE III. 259 ing seditious publications. In Scotland, Mr Muir, a young advo cate at the Scottish bar, and Mr Fysche Palmer, a Unitarian minister in Dundee, were brought to trial in the autumn of 1793, and sentenced, the former to fourteen, the latter to seven, years' transportation. Soon after, Messrs Skirving, Margaret, and Ger rald, were apprehended at a meeting of the reform delegates at Edinburgh, and tried on similar charges of seditious practices, and sentenced to fourteen years' transportation. In September 1794, two individuals, named Robert Watt and David Downie, were brought to trial in Edinburgh, on a charge of high treason. Watt had been a spy, employed by government to attend political so cieties, and discover the designs of their leaders ; but, as he had been nuable to communicate intelligence of much importance, he had received little pay. He had, therefore, contrived a plot, which he had communicated to Downie and some others, for seizing the Castle and the public offices in Edinburgh, with a view, it is be lieved, of afterwards betraying his associates to government. But the accidental discovery of some pikes, which he had deposited in a cellar in his own house, brought the whole affair to light ; and he and Downie were both found guilty of high treason. The latter was recommended to mercy, and afterwards pardoned ; but Watt was executed. 25. On the 4th of November 1794, Warsaw was taken by the Russians, after a desperate resistance ; the Infamous partition of Poland was completed by the three powers, Russia, Austria, and Prussia ; and that unfortunate country was blotted out of the map of Em-ope. 26. The French armies still continued victorious on the conti nent ; and, in consequence of their signal successes, Tuscany, Prus sia, Spain, and other powers, withdrew from the confederacy in the course of 1795, and acknowledged the French republic. During the summer of this year, a dearth, approaching to famine, pre vailed in Britain, and serious riots took place in consequence of the dearness of provisions. The king, on going to open the session of parliament, was surrounded by an immense crowd, who clamo rously cried out, \" Peace, peace ! Give us bread. No famine. No war !\" and stones and other missiles were thrown at the state coach ; but happily, his majesty escaped without injury. On the 8th of April 1795, the Prince of Wales was married to the Prin cess Caroline, daughter of the Duke of Brunswick. The campaign of 1796 was opened with great activity by the French. Their gene rals, Moreau and Jourdan, penetrated into Germany ; but were ul timately repulsed by the Archduke Charles. It was on this occa sion that Moreau made his celebrated retreat of 300 miles, amidst"], [296, "[A. D. 1797 260 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. hostile armies, and through the difficulties and entanglements of the Black Forest. On the side of Italy, the armies of the republic met with the most brilliant successes. Bonaparte, their new general in that quarter, gained, in rapid succession, a series of the most splendid victories at Montenotte, Millesimo, Dego, Lodi, Arcole, and other places, and drove the Austrians completely out of Italy. In conse quence of these conquests, the British ministry, in order to appease the nation, found it necessary to send Lord Malmesbury to Paris, on the pretence of attempting to negotiate a peace ; but it was after wards admitted by Mr Pitt that they had no wish to conclude a treaty, and that the measure was adopted merely in compliance with the wishes of the public. As might have been expected, therefore, no satisfactory agreement could be made between the belligerent powers. 27. At the close of the year, the French Directory, in consequence of an invitation from a disaffected party in Ireland, sent an expedi tion of seventeen ships of the line, and many smaller vessels, having on board an army of 18,000 men, under General Roche, to invade that country. The violence of the weather prevented this arma ment from assembling at the rendezvous in Bantry Bay, and no landing was in consequence attempted ; so that the fleet returned home, with the loss of two ships of the line and two frigates which perished in a tempest, and of one frigate taken by the English. 28. The French had now acquired such an ascendancy over the Spanish monarchy, as to induce the government of that countiy to declare war against Britain. Soon after, the Spanish fleet, amount ing to twenty-seven sail of the line, attempted to join a French armament ; but they were attacked by Sir John Jervis on the 14th of February 1797, near Cape St Vincent, with only fifteen sail of the line, and four of their ships, of from seventy-four to a hundred and twelve guns, were made prizes by the British fleet. 29. At the commencement of the summer of this year, an alarm ing mutiny broke out in the navy, at Spithead, occasioned by the severity of the discipline, the insufficiency of the provisions, the un equal distribution of prize-money, and the smallness of pay. As the demands of the seamen were of the most reasonable kind, an act was passed, removing then grievances, and subordination was re stored at Spithead and Plymouth. Another mutiny shortly after broke out at the Nore, where the demands of the seamen were of a much more extensive nature, and were strongly disapproved of by the public, and by the Portsmouth and Plymouth fleets. The Go vernment made preparations to put down the mutiny by force ; but themutinccrs having disagreed among themselves, gradually returned to then- duty, and a seaman, named Richard Parker, and other ring leaders, were brought to trial, and executed."], [297, "A. D. 1798.] GEORGE III 261 30. On the 24th of July, Admiral Nelson made an unsuccessful attack on Santa Craiz, in the island of Teneriffe. Many valuable lives were lost in this attempt, and Nelson himself had his arm shot off. On the 21th of October, Admiral Duncan attacked the Dutch fleet under De Winter, off Camperdown, and after a severe engage ment, captured eight of the enemy's ships, including those of the admiral and vice-admiral, and four frigates. 31. In the mean time, the successes of the French arms had com pelled the Emperor of Austria to conclude preliminaries of peace at Leoben, on the 18th of April ; and a definitive treaty was signed at Campo Formio, on the 17th of October. 32. Britain was now left alone in the contest, into which she had originally entered as an auxiliary to Austria and Prussia. It was the most disastrous period of the war. Public credit became af fected, a panic seized the minds of the community, and a run, of such an alarming nature, was made upon the Bank of England, that it was authorized by parliament to discontinue the payment of its notes in cash. The expenses of the government had now swelled to an enormous amount ; and, in order to defray them, the assessed taxes were trebled, and a heavy income-tax was imposed on all persons whose incomes amounted to sixty pounds a-year. To add to the embanassments of the country, a rebellion broke out in Le land in the summer of 1798 The refusal of Roman Catholic eman cipation, and the general conduct of the govemmeut, had excited great disaffection among the Irish people, which at length manifested itself in an open attempt to cast off the dominion of Great Britain. The rising was precipitated by the discovery and apprehension of the principal leaders of the disaffected party. Great cruelties were perpetrated, both by the rebels and by the royal troops, and many lives were lost, and much property destroyed, before the rebellion was suppressed. As the weakness of the French navy rendered it impossible for them to engage in any serious attack against the British dominions in Europe, the Directoiy now formed the design of sending Bonaparte with an army to seize upon Egypt, which they counted upon not only as a valuable acquisition in itself, but as a station whence the English power in the East Indies might be advantageously assailed. Accordingly, a formidable fleet was col lected at Toulon, which set sail, with a powerful army on board, before the British government suspected its destination, and reached the coast of Egypt in safety, on the 1st of July. There Bonaparte landed his troops, and made himself master of the greater part of the country. In the mean time, the French fleet, under Admiral Brueys, remained at anchor near the shore, in the bay of Aboukir. In this position, they were attacked by Nelson on the 1st of August,"], [298, "262 [A. D. 1799 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and completely defeated, with the loss of nine sail of the line, which were captured, while two more and two frigates were destroyed. During the conflict, the French flag ship, L'Orient, of 120 guns, blew up, and the admiral and his crew, to the number of 1000, perished in the explosion. 33. The victory of the Nile, one of the most splendid in our naval annals, revived the hopes of the enemies of France, and a new co alition against that country was formed by Britain, Austria, Russia, and Naples. The hordes of Russia, brought into the field by the subsidies of England, were united with the Austrian forces, and, in a number of conflicts with the French, proved almost uniformly successful. After gigantic efforts on both sides, the campaign ter minated with the French being driven out of Italy, with the excep tion of Savoy and Geneva. An unsuccessful attempt was made by the British to drive the French out of Holland. The Dutch fleet surrendered to Admiral Mitchell, the sailors refusing to fight against the cause of the Prince of Orange. But the invasion was ill con certed and ill directed, and the Duke of York, the British com mander, was obliged to evacuate the country by capitulation ; and, as the price of being suffered to reimbark without molestation, it was agreed that 8000 Dutch or French prisoners in England were to be liberated. During this year, the British power in India was greatly augmented, and its tenitoiy extended, by the fall of Tippoo Saib, the gon and successor of Hyder Ali. On the 4th of May, Seringapa tam, the capital of his kingdom, was taken by storm, and Tippoo himself perished, fighting gallantly at one of the gates of the fortress. 34. After the conquest of Egypt, Bonaparte had invaded Syria, and subdued or conciliated most of the native tribes ; but his career of victory was stopped at St Jean d'Acre, by the Turkish governor, assisted by the British, under Sir Sydney Smith. He was ulti mately forced to raise the siege, and return into Egypt, where he defeated a Turkish army at Aboukir. Here, having learned from an old newspaper the great reverses which the French armies had undergone during his absence, and the general discontent which these misfortunes had produced, he resolved to return to France. Leaving the command of the army to General Kleber, he secretly embarked, along with a few friends, on board a small vessel, and having had the good fortune to escape the British cruisers, he landed safely at Frejus on the 7th of October 1799. Shortly after his return, the French government was changed, the Directory was dissolved, and Bonaparte was appointed First Consul of the French Republic. Attempts were made by him to open negotiations for peace with Britain, but, as the ministry doubted his sincerity, his overtures were rejected."], [299, "263 CHAPTER XXV. A. D. 1800 to U20.

Louis X VII I. makes his public entry into Paris. 1808. Frederick VI., King of Denmark. 1. The campaign of 1800 was conducted, on the part of the French government, with great ability and decision. Bonaparte un expectedly crossed the Alps by the Great St Bernard, descended into the Milanese with little opposition, and defeated the Austrians in the great battle of Marengo, which forced them to agree to an ar mistice, and to surrender to the French Genoa, Tortona, and other strong places. On the side of Germany, the French, under General Moreau, were scarcely less successful. They defeated the Austrians in several successive engagements, and compelled them to cross the Danube, leaving the French masters of the electorate of Bavaria. An armistice was agreed to, and negotiations for peace entered upon, but they were ultimately laid aside. In the mean time, the Em peror Paul of Russia, actuated by the natural irritability of his tem per, and an admiration of military success, not only entered into a close alliance with Bonaparte, but seized the British vessels in his ports ; whilst the Danes, Swedes, and Prussians formed a confede racy, for warding the right claimed in war by maritime states, of preventing their enemies from being supplied with naval stores by means of neutral vessels. 2. The great measure of legislative union with Ireland was car ried into effect during the present session of parliament, to com mence January 1, 1801. By this important act, the established churches and legislatures of the two countries became consolidated, and the two kingdoms united under the name of the United King dom of Great Britain and Ireland. Four lords spiritual, by rotation, and twenty-eight temporal lords, elected for life, were to represent the Irish peers in the House of Lords, and one hundred commoners were to have seats in the House of Commons. The laws and courts"], [300, "[A. D. 1801. 264 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of each kingdom were to remain unchanged. The contributions of the two countries, towards the public expenditure, were, for twenty years, to be in the proportion of fifteen to two, but the public debt already incurred was to be separately defrayed. 3. The French still continued victorious on the Continent. Mo reau defeated the Austrians with tremendous loss at Hohenlinden, drove them back upon their capital, and advanced within fifty-two miles of Vienna ; while, at the same time, signal defeats were sus tained by them, both in Italy and in Franconia. In these disas trous circumstances, the Austrians were compelled to sue for peace, which was accordingly concluded at Luneville on the 9th of Febru ary 1801. 4. Great Britain was at this time greatly distressed by a scarcity of provisions, and riots broke out in London and some provincial towns. Various measures were adopted with a view to remedy the existing distress ; but they were ill-devised, and produced little or no effect. The commencement of the year 1801 was marked by the termination of Mr Pitt's government, an event which created no small degree of astonishment. The ostensible cause assigned for this step, was the refusal of the king to consent to the emancipation of the Roman Catholics \u2014 a concession which Mr Pitt deemed essen tial to give complete effect to the union with Ireland. Mr Adding ton, who had for some time filled the office of Speaker of the House of Commons, was appointed prime minister. 5. The army which Bonaparte had lest in Egypt, being disgusted by the desertion of then leader, entered into a negotiation with the Turkish grand vizier and Sir Sydney Smith, to abandon the whole of Egypt, on condition of being permitted to return unmolested to France. But Lord Keith, acting under instructions from the Bri tish government, refused to ratify this agreement ; and when, after wards, an order arrived from Britain to agree to the treaty with Sir Sydney Smith, the state of affairs had changed, and the French re fused to evacuate the country. Owing to this blunder, it became necessary to send an army to drive them out of Egypt ; and Sir Ralph Abercromby, a gallant and experienced officer, was appointed to command the forces despatched upon this service. On the 20th of March, an obstinate engagement took place near Alexandria, be tween the French and British armies, in which the former were completely defeated. But the British army suffered a great cala mity in the loss of its gallant general. General Hutcheson, who succeeded to the command, followed up this victory so effectually, that, early in autumn, the French anny capitulated, upon condition of being conveyed, with then arms, artillery, and effects, to their own countiy."], [301, "A. D. 1803.] GEORGE III. 265 6. In the meanwhile, to prevent the active co-operation of Den mark with Russia, and, if possible, to break up the northern confe deracy, a powerful armament sailed for the Baltic, March 12th, under the command of Admiral Parker and Vice-Admiral Nelson. On approaching the harbour of Copenhagen, the Danish fleet was descried, flanked and supported by eleven floating batteries, and by powerful artillery placed on two artificial islands, called the Crown Batteries, and on the island of Amak. The attack, which was, at his own request, entrusted to Nelson, took place on the 2d of April It lasted for four hours, and ended in the complete destruction of the Danish fleet. The loss of the British, in killed and wounded, fell little short of 1200 ; whilst that of the Danes, including prison ers, amounted to about 6000. Soon after this sanguinary action, Denmark seceded from the treaty of Arnied Neutrality, into which she had entered with Russia and Sweden. A few days previous to the engagement, the Emperor Paul of Russia was strangled in his palace ; and his son and successor Alexander immediately disclaim ed all hostility against Great Britain ; and, shortly after, the dis putes between this country and the northern states were satisfacto rily adjusted. On the 13th of July, Sir James Saumarez, with a greatly inferior force, attacked a fleet of the enemy, amounting to ten sail of the line, and defeated them, with the loss of four of then ships. Negotiations for peace had for some time been carrying on with great secrecy. At length, the preliminary articles were signed at London on the 1st of October 1801, and the definitive treaty was signed at Amiens on the 25th of March 1802. The intelligence of this event was joyfully received by the people of both countries. 7. The treaty of Amiens was never canied into effect. Neither party had confidence in the other ; both, therefore, kept themselves in readiness to renew the conflict. Bonaparte was unceasingly oc cupied in extending his power upon the continent, in forming schemes of aggrandisement, entering into secret alliances, and annexing im portant territories to the French dominions. These proceedings excited the suspicion and jealousy of Britain ; and she, in conse quence, refused to deliver up the island of Malta to the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, alleging that the French consul had, by his intrigues, destroyed the independence of that order, for the purpose of getting Malta into his own possession. In these circumstances, war again broke out on the 18th of May 1803. The British fleet swept the seas of the enemy, and conquered the Dutch and French West India colonies. Bonaparte, on the other hand, revived the threat of an invasion of Britain, assembled flotillas of boats at Bou logne, to be ready for the embarkation of his troops, and seized Ha nover, though that country was not involved in the war with France. it"], [302, "[A. D. 1804. 266 HISTORY' OF SCOTLAND. 8. On the 1st of May 1804, Bonaparte was made emperor of France ; on the 12th of the same month, Mr Pitt returned to office as prime minister, \u2014 abandoning, however, Catholic emancipation, the refusal of which was the alleged ground of his retirement from office. A squadron of four frigates, sent out to intercept the Span ish treasure-ships, met, on the 5th of October, the Spanish squadron proceeding towards Cadiz, and the Spanish commodore refusing to surrender, an engagement ensued, which terminated in the capture of three of the Spanish frigates, and the explosion of the fourth, ac companied with the loss of many lives. This act, which led soon afterwards to a declaration of war on the part of Spain, excited great indignation both at home and abroad, and was productive of the worst impressions, in regard to our national honour. It was de fended on the plea that Spain had been compelled by Bonaparte to pay a large annual contribution in lieu of a contingent of troops, which she was bound, by the treaty of 1796, to furnish to France. 9. In 1805, a third coalition was formed against France, ill-con certed, and worse directed than any previous combination against that power. Bonaparte, by his masterly plans and the energy of his movements, suddenly invested Ulm, and compelled General Mack, with 30,000 Austrians, to lay down their arms on the 17th of Octo ber ; and, on the 2d of December, he terminated the war, by defeat ing, at Austerlitz, the combined armies of the Austrians and Rus sians, with immense slaughter. This victory compelled Austria to conclude an immediate peace on veiy disadvantageous terms. While the French were everywhere victorious on the continent, Britain gained the greatest of her naval triumphs, the victory at Trafalgar. The combined French and Spanish fleets, consisting of thirty-three sail of the line, put to sea from Cadiz on the 19th of October, and, on the 21st, encountered, off Cape Trafalgar, the British fleet under Lord Nelson, consisting of twenty-seven sail of the line. The battle began at noon, and, after from two to three hours' hard fighting, terminated in the capture of nineteen of the enemy's ships. But the victory was purchased by the death of the gallant Nelson, who expired just as the action closed. Four ships which escaped under Rear- Admiral Dumanoir, were captured, on the 2d of November, off Cape Ortegal, by a squadron under Sir Richard Strachan. 10. Mr Pitt died on the 23d of January 1806 ; and a new admi nistration was formed, consisting of Lord Grenville and Mr Fox, and their friends and supporters. On the 29th of April, Lord Melville, who had been first lord of the admiralty under Pitt, was brought to trial before the House of Lords, on certain charges af fecting his conduct while holding the office of treasurer of the navy. The trial closed on the 12th of June, with the acquittal of his"], [303, "A. D. 1807.] GEORGE m. 267 lordship. On the 13th of September, Mr Fox died ; and, in the month of March following, the ministry were turned out of office, in consequence of their attempting to remove religious tests in the army and navy. During the short time this administration remain ed in power, it succeeded in abolishing the iniquitous slave trade. The bill for this purpose received the royal assent on the 25th of March 1807. 11. Meanwhile the French emperor continued his career of am bition and territorial aggrandisement. Holland was made an inde pendent kingdom, and Louis Bonaparte was placed on the throne. His brother Joseph was made king of Naples. Bavaria, Wurtem berg, and other smaller states, were detached from the Germanic empire, and formed into \" The Confederation of the Rhine,\" under the protection of France. Ultimately war was declared by Bona parte against Prussia ; and, on the 14th of October 1806, he de feated the Prussian army in the battle of Jena, which decided the fate of that country, and deprived it of its army, capital, and fort resses. The valour of the Russians at the battle of Eylau, fought on the 8th of February 1807, encouraged the hope of arresting the progress of Bonaparte ; but this expectation was destroyed by the battle of Friedland (June 14th), in which the Russians were defeat ed, with the loss of 18,000 men, killed and wounded ; and the war was terminated by the treaty of Tilsit, concluded on the 7th of July 1807. 12. Bonaparte now commenced what was termed the continental system, by which the British islands were declared to be in a state of blockade ; commerce in all British produce and manufactures was prohibited, and all British property found in countries occupied by the French troops confiscated as a lawful prize. The ministiy re taliated by issuing an order in council, prohibiting the trading of neutral powers with those ports which were in possession of France and her allies. The effect of these measures was the destruction of neutral commerce ; and so rancorous had become the hatred of the two governments, that the dictates of international law, and the rights of nations, were disregarded by both, in then eagerness to injure each other. As soon as the treaty of Tilsit was made known to the British ministry, they sent a powerful armament to take pos session of the Danish fleet, belonging to a neutral power, on the plea that this step was' necessary to prevent it from falling into the hands of the French. As the Danes were naturally unwilling to submit to this demand, a tremendous fire was opened upon Copen hagen, by which a great part of the city was consumed, and two thousand lives destroyed. The garrison then capitulated, and the fleet was delivered up to the British admiral, by whom it was con-"], [304, "[A. D. 1808. 268 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. veyed to England, to remain there till the termination of the war. This veiy questionable act was loudly condemned, both at home and abroad. 13. The influence possessed by Bonaparte over Spain had long inspired him with the hope of overawing Portugal, and of obliging that country to dissolve her alliance with England. About the close of 1807, the most peremptory demands were made upon the court of Lisbon, to exclude British merchantmen from the harbours of Portugal, to confiscate English property, and to detain the Eng lish residents who were in that countiy. To the first of these com pliance was promised ; but the latter met with a decided refusal. A French army, therefore, marched towards Lisbon, and threatened to overthrow the house of Braganza. The latter adopted the spi rited determination of abandoning their European dominions, and proceeding to Brazil. This resolution they accordingly canied into effect in the end of November ; and immediately after, the com bined forces of France and Spain took possession of Lisbon. 14. In 1808, the French emperor commenced a series of the most extraordinary intrigues, which ended in his seizing the crown of Spain, under the mockery of an assignment, and placing it on the head of his brother Joseph, whose place on the throne of Naples was filled by his brother-in-law Murat. The Spanish people, in dignant at this act of perfidy and usurpation, took up arms to vin dicate then national liberties ; and before the end of summer, the entire peninsula from Oporto to Saragossa was in a state of organ ized insurrection against the French power. Britain, ever watch ful to strike a blow at her implacable enemy, immediately sent Sir Arthur Wellesley with 10,000 troops, to co-operate with the pa triots in expelling their common foe. On the 21st of August he attacked the French under Junot at Vimiera, and completely de feated them ; and on the 30th, by the convention of Cintra, they agreed to evacuate Portugal. 15. In the mean time, the Spaniards had obtained some impor tant advantages over their enemies, had successfully defended the open town of Saragossa against all the assaults of a French army, and had compelled Joseph Bonaparte to quit Madrid, and to retreat to Burgos. Bonaparte, therefore, placed himself at the head of the French army, defeated the Spaniards at Tudela, and entered Madrid in triumph. 16. The British troops, under Sir John Moore, were now advan cing from Portugal into Spain to co-operate with the patriots. In the course of his march, the British general soon discovered how fallacious and exaggerated were the impressions entertained in Eng land respecting the condition of the Spaniards, and their ability or"], [305, "A. D. 1809.] GEORGE III. 269 inclination to offer an effective resistance to the enemy. He con tinued his march, however, in order to comply, as far as possible, with the expectations of the ministry, and the urgent representa tions made to him ; till, at length, having learned that Madrid had fallen, and that Bonaparte had quitted that city at the head of a superior force, with the view of taking up a position in the rear of the British, while another army under Soult lay in front, he found it indispensable to make a prompt retreat. This he accomplished in the most masterly manner, though the weather was severe, pro-: visions scanty, the inhabitants of the country cold and lurfriendly, and a veteran army, greatly superior in numbers, pressing on his rear. This famous retreat closed at Coranna on the 11th of Janu ary 1809, having been attended with the loss of many men from disorder, and the sacrifice of many horses from want of forage ; but without a standard having been taken, or a single check sustained in action. The transports, on board of which the troops were to embark, unfortunately did not reach Corunna till two days after the arrival of the army. In consequence of this delay, it became necessary to risk an engagement on the 6th, in very disadvantage ous circumstances, and against an enemy greatly superior in num bers. In spite of this disparity, however, the French were every where repulsed, and compelled to retreat with the loss of 2000 men. But the gallant Sir John Moore was mortally wounded in the action by a cannon ball. General Baird being also disabled, Sir John Hope took the command, and succeeded in embarking the troops, and bringing them off safely without further molestation. 17. The diversion of the Peninsular war tempted Austria a fourth time to enter the lists against France, but with no better success than on former occasions. The struggle was brief, but sharp and decisive ; and the sanguinary engagements of Altensberg, Aspern, and Wagram, compelled the Austrians to sue for peace. To assist the efforts of our ally, the British government fitted out, in the course of the summer, the memorable Walcheren expedition, for the purpose of taking possession of Flushing, and destroying the French arsenals and dockyards in the Scheldt. This, which was the largest of all the British continental enterprises, was also the most disastrous ; and the ignominious nature of the failure threw great discredit both on the ministry and on the officers whom they selected for the direction of the undertaking. 18. On the 28th of July, Sir Arthur Wellesley, to whom the command of the British forces in the Peninsula was now entrusted, defeated the French in a sanguinary engagement at Talavera. But the junction of Soult, Ney, and Moreau, and their march upon a point in his rear, compelled him to fall back upon Badajoz."], [306, "[A. D. 1812. 270 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. On the 26th of October, the king entered the fiftieth year of his reign, which was celebrated throughout the empire as a national jubilee. The failure of the Walcheren expedition, and previous dissensions among the ministers, broke up the government ; and an attempt to obtain the assistance of some of the leaders of the oppo sition having failed, Mr Perceval was placed at the head of the administration. On the 17th of December, Bonaparte divorced the Empress Josephine ; and, on the 1st of April following, married the Austrian Archduchess Maria Louisa. 19. The year 1810 was not distinguished by many events of im portance. The stagnation in the trade, and the depreciation in the currency of the country, produced severe distress throughout the community. The struggles of the Spaniards against their invaders had dwindled down to an irregular war, canied on by parties of guerillas. The French overran Portugal, but suffered a repulse at Busaco ; and finding themselves unable to force the lines of Torres Vedras, behind which the British army had retired, they were ulti mately compelled to retreat into Spain. The mental disorder of George III. having returned, it was resolved, in imitation of the course followed by Mr Pitt, to vest the regency in the Prince of Wales, under certain restrictions which were to continue till Fe bruary I, 1812. It was confidently expected, that the prince regent would have called into office the leaders of the opposition, with whom the early habits of his public life had been formed; but his royal highness thought proper to retain his father's advisers, so that no change took place either in the character or policy of the govern ment. On the 5th of March 1811, was fought the battle of Barossa, in which Sir Thomas Graham, with an inferior force, defeated Mar shal Victor. On the 10th, Badajoz, with a Spanish ganison of more than 7000 men, surrendered, in a very discreditable manner, to the French. Massena made an attempt to relieve Almeida, of which our troops had begun the siege, and, on the 3d and 5th of May, attacked the British at Fuentes de Honore, but was repulsed with great loss, and compelled to leave Almeida to its fate. Marshal Beresford having laid siege to Badajoz, at the head of an army composed of English and Portuguese troops, Soult advanced to its relief, and attacked the allies on the 16th of May, at the village of Albuera. The conflict was long and severe, and at one time very doubtful ; but in the end, the French were defeated with great slaughter. In the month of August, Batavia, the capital of the Dutch settlements in the East Indies, surrendered to Sir Samuel Auchmuty ; and the whole island of Java, in which it is situated, was added to our eastern possessions. 20. The year 1812 was memorable for the commencement of the"], [307, "A. D. 1812.] GEORGE III. 271 decline of the power of the French emperor. Russia had never en tered heartily into the continental policy of France, as her trade with Britain was of great importance, and the Russian nobility found in the British ports the principal market for the sale of the productions of then estates. On this, aud on some other point3, differences arose between France and Russia ; and a fierce contest was entered into between these great powers, without any formal declaration of war. On the 9th of May, Bonaparte lest Paris to join the grand army in Poland. His progress was like a continued triumph, he was received with such excessive adulation in his march through Dresden, Dantzic, and Konigsberg, to the frontiers of Rus sia ; which he reached on the 23d of June. On this hue he had assembled nearly half a million of soldiers, the finest and most for midable army France had ever sent beyond her own tenitory ; and, crossing the Niemen, the frontier river of Russia, he began the cam paign. His object was to bring on an immediate engagement ; but the plan of the Russians was to avoid a decisive battle, to draw the invaders as far as possible from then resources, and at last to fall on them when famine, fatigue, and the rigours of a northern climate had abated their enthusiasm and exhausted their strength. 21. After several sanguinary engagements at Smolensk and Bo rodino, Bonaparte reached Moscow on the 14th of September, but found it almost entirely deserted of its inhabitants. On the very day in which the French took possession of Moscow, fires appeared in different parts of the city. Vigorous measures were taken to arrest the progress of the flames, but without success. The con flagration spread rapidly ; on the 16th, the city presented the sub lime and appalling spectacle of a vast ocean of flame ; and by the evening of the 20th, nine-tenths of Moscow had been reduced to ashes. No provision whatever had been made for sheltering the miserable population, who were driven to seek an asylum in the neighbouring woods, and more than 20,000 perished in the flames. 22. The situation of the French emperor had become imminently critical ; but, with a strange fatality, he lingered for nearly a month among the ruins of Moscow. On the 19th of October, the main body of the army evacuated the city, leaving Marshal Mortier, with the rear-guard, to blow up the arsenals, the magazines, and the Kremlin. Then route lay through 300 miles of a country already devastated, and at every step of their march they were incessantly assailed by hordes of Cossacks. On the 7th of November they reached Smolensk ; but as it was impossible to remain there, the retreat was recommenced on the 14th. The cold had now set in with excessive severity, and alternate frost, sleet, and snow, made the weather insupportable. In one night, 30,000 horses perished ;"], [308, "[A. D. 1813. 272 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and the soldiers, overcome by cold, hunger, and fatigue, died by hundreds, or fell by thousands beneath the swords of the Russians The whole line of retreat was strewed with the wounded, the dying, and the dead. The Russian armies gathered round the invaders at all points to cut off their retreat, and made dreadful havoc among their disorganized ranks. At length, on the 17th of December, the miserable remains of this once mighty army found shelter in Konigs berg, having lost in this destructive campaign 400,000 men ; of whom 41 generals, 1298 officers, and 167,000 privates, together with their whole artillery and baggage, had been captured by the Russians. 23. On the 3d of December Bonaparte privately quitted the army, leaving Murat to conduct the retreat, and on the 18th reached Paris, where he immediately began to raise a conscription of 350,000 men, to supply the loss of the grand army. But the overwhelming dis asters of the Russian expedition had destroyed his ascendancy, and removed the ten-or of his power. Tidings of evil came crowding in thick and fast. Prussia was the first to abandon his alliance, and join the Russians. The crown prince of Sweden speedily imitated her example. Against these three powers the French emperor opened the campaign of 1813. By the most extraordinary exer tions, he defeated the combined army in the battles of Lutzen and Bautzen. But these victories led to no decisive results. Austria now offered her mediation ; and an armistice was agreed to, which lasted upwards of two months. But the proposal to conclude an amicable arrangement was only a pretext, on the part of the allies, to gain time to mature their plans and collect their forces ; and on the 12th of August, Austria, whose conduct in this affair was mark ed by duplicity and perfidy, declared war against France. The allies had now a vast numerical superiority ; but they were defeat ed, notwithstanding, at Dresden, with great loss, and compelled to retreat into Bohemia. The tide of fortune, however, now turned. Wherever Napoleon appeared personally, his ascendancy was in stantly manifest. But his lieutenants had neither his genius, nor his activity and energy, and were beaten at all points. On the 5th of October, the French emperor was compelled to quit his position at Dresden, and to concentrate his forces in the neighbourhood of Leipsic. Here, on the 18th, was sought the great battle which de cided the fate of the French empire. Bonaparte was completely defeated ; and, with 70,000 men, the remains of 280,000 whom he had led into Saxony, he retreated towards the Rhine. , 24. Fresh enemies rose up on all sides, now that his power was rapidly on the wane, and new disasters accumulated around him. Holland threw off his yoke, and welcomed back the Prince of"], [309, "A. D. 1813.] GEORGE HI. 273 Orange. In Italy, the Pope was restored, and conducted back to Rome amidst the joyful acclamations of the people. About the same time Ferdinand was liberated from confinement, and permit ted to return to Spain. All things seemed fast returning to their ancient course. 25. Meanwhile the French arms were equally unsuccessful in the Peninsula. On the 8th of January 1812, Lord Wellington canied Ciudad Rodiigo by storm. In the beginning of April, Badajoz sur rendered, after a brief siege, which, however, cost the British nearly 5000 men. On the 22d of July, the French under Marmont were defeated near Salamanca ; and on the 12th of August, Madrid was taken possession of by the allies. But the approach of Soult from the south, and of the army that had fought at Salamanca from the east, compelled Lord Wellington to make a rapid and disorderly re treat to the frontier of Portugal. 26. The campaign of 1813 opened by an attack on the allied army under Sir John Murray, in which the French under Suchet were repulsed. In the western part of the Peninsula, Lord Wel lington found himself, for the first time, at the head of a superior force, which he wielded with consummate skill. By a masterly man\u0153uvre, he compelled the French to abandon the strong position on the Douro, and to evacuate one town after another, till at last they took up a position at Vittoria, near the northern frontier of Spain. Here, on the 21st of June, they were defeated, and com pelled to retreat into France, with the loss of all their artillery, ammunition, and baggage. The British next undertook the siege of St Sebastian, a frontier fortress of great importance, which the French made the most vigorous efforts to relieve. On the 24th of July, Soult recrossed the Bidassoa, attacked the right wing of the allies at Roncesvalles, forced their position, and compelled them to retreat to the vicinity of Pampeluna, where, on the 27th and 28th, they sustained a succession of impetuous and sanguinary attacks from the enemy. But on the 29th, Lord Wellington resumed the offensive, and obliged the French to retrace their steps through the Pyrenees. St Sebastian was taken by assault on the 31st of Au gust, with the loss, however, on our part, of two thousand five hun dred men. Pampeluna capitulated on the 26th. On the 7th of October, our army advanced into the French territory, and on the 10th of November, the enemy were driven from their position near St Jean de Luz, and compelled to retreat across the Nivelle. In the beginning of December, Soult made a succession of impetuous attacks on the allied army, all of which were repulsed with heavy loss. On the 25th of February, Lord Wellington defeated the French at Orthes, and, on the following day, crossed the Adour."], [310, "[A. D. 1814. 274 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Soult had now taken up a strong position near Toulouse, and here, on the 10th of April, a sanguinary battle took place, attended with a loss to the allies of nearly five thousand men, which, as well as a great number of lives on the part of the French, might have been prevented, had earlier intelligence arrived of the overthrow of Bona parte, and the change of government at Paris. 27. We must now return to the state of the war in Germany. After the battle of Leipsic, the situation of Napoleon had become critical in the extreme. Bavaria, Denmark, and even his brother in-law, Murat, king of Naples, had now joined the allies, so that all Europe in arms was arrayed against France. Eleven hundred thousand enemies were advancing from various points to pour their invading tonents upon that country, while her forces did not amount to a third of that number, and nearly the whole of these were newly levied conscripts. At the commencement of the year 1814, the al lied armies crossed the Rhine, the French retiring as they advanced, unable to resist their overwhelming force. On the 25th, the Em peror left Paris to join his army. His transcendant military genius was strikingly manifested by the manner in which he maintained to the last a hopeless contest. Finding himself unable to cope with the superior numbers of his enemies in every quarter, he attempted to concentrate his force at particular points, and, by attacking the invaders in succession, cut off their communications, and destroy them in detail. But though he was successful in various instances, his great inferiority in numbers rendered it impossible for him to stop the progress of the enemy. 28. On the 4th of February, negotiations for peace were opened at Chatillon ; but, elated by some temporary advantages which he had obtained over the allies, Bonaparte rejected the terms offered him, and proposed others, which were peremptorily refused, and on the 11th, the negotiation was declared to be at an end. In spite of every effort to retard their progress, the allies continued to ad vance from different parts upon Paris. Bonaparte having effected a junction with Marshal Macdonald, pushed between the Prussian and Austrian armies, and attempted, by menacing the rear of the latter, to cause them to renounce their advance upon the capital. But disregarding this movement, the allied generals determined to continue their march to Paris. On the 30th of March, they com menced the attack of the several heights around Paris, which were occupied by about twenty-five thousand troops under Mortier and Marmont. After a furious conflict, the heights of Belleville were carried, upon which, Marmont, not without strong suspicions of treachery, offered to capitulate ; and on the last day of March, the Emperor of Russia aud the King of Prussia entered the French ca-"], [311, "A. D. 1814.] GEORGE IH. 275 pital at the head of then troops. Bonaparte, who had advanced near the bridge of Charenton, refused at first to give credit to the tidings of the capitulation. Finding that all was lost, he retired to Fountainbleau. The allies had now explicitly declared that they would no more treat with Bonaparte or any of his family, and inti mated their intention to restore the exiled family. A provisional government was appointed, with Talleyrand at its head ; and a decree was passed by the French senate, declaring that Bonaparte had forfeited the throne. In these circumstances, finding himself deserted by his marshals, officers, and dependants, he signed an un conditional abdication, and, on the 11th of April 1814, his dynasty expired. Louis XVHI. was appointed sovereign of France, and a new constitution was adopted and guaranteed to the country. 29. We must now proceed to notice military operations conduct ed in a very different quarter, and involving considerations very distinct from those which animated the contest on the continent of Europe. During the course of the long-continued war with France, serious differences arose with the United States, in consequence of the practice of our naval officers impressing American seamen, on suspicion of their being British subjects. These differences were greatly aggravated by the orders in council, which were intended to put a stop to neutral traffic, except when carried on by a licence from the English government. The Americans retaliated by hostile edicts, which reduced our manufacturers to great distress. When Lord Liverpool became prime minister, the orders in council were repealed, but, unhappily, the Americans had declared war against Britain before this intelligence could reach them ; and, heated by the contest, and attributing the change to the dread of losing Ca nada, they refused all our offers of accommodation. 30. The naval conflicts in the first year of the war ended unfor tunately for the British. The Guerriere frigate was captured on the 19th of August 1812, by the Constitution American frigate ; the Macedonia, on the 25th of October, by another American frigate, called the United States ; and, on the 29th of December, the Java was obliged, after a dreadful conflict, to strike to the Constitution. The cause of these defeats lay in the great superiority of the Ameri can vessels, both in the complement of men, and in the weight of metal. No sooner did the two nations meet on an equal footing, in the case of the Chesapeake and Shannon, June 1813, than the su periority was found to rest with the British. 31. The operations by land originated with the Americans, and were directed to the conquest of Canada. But, in consequence of the impatience and insubordination of the troops, their attempts proved signal failures, and three successive detachments were oblig-"], [312, "[A. D. 1814. 276 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ed to surrender to the British. In the next campaign they took the field with augmented forces, and were more successful, having taken York, the chief town of Upper Canada, and captured a small squa dron on Lake Erie ; but they failed in making any serious impres sion in Canada. Buffalo and Fort Oswego fell into the hands of the British, and several attacks of the Americans were repulsed with considerable loss. On the other hand, a British flotilla, consisting of a frigate and several smaller vessels, was captured on Lake Cham plain, on the 11th of September 1814. An enterprise, planned by Admiral Cochrane and General Ross against the city of Washing ton, was more successful. An American army, strongly posted within five miles of the capital, fled at the first onset. Washington was entered the same evening (24th of August), and the public build ings were destroyed, but private property was respected. The Bri tish troops re-embarked on the 30th, and proceeded against Balti more ; but, finding that the Americans had made vigorous prepara tions for the defence of the town, they retired without any loss of consequence, except that of their commander, General Ross. An expedition on a larger scale, directed against New Orleans, was re pulsed, with the loss of the three principal officers, and nearly two thousand privates killed or wounded. The last land operation of the war was the capture of Fort Mobile, and the final exploit at sea was the capture of the American frigate President. Peace was concluded at Ghent on the 24th of December 1814. The disputes respecting tenitorial boundaries were lest to be determined by commissioners mutually appointed, while no mention was made of the questions which had originated the war. 32. On the downfal of Bonaparte, the allies left him the choice of his retreat, and he selected the island of Elba, which was given to him in full sovereignty. On the 4th of May, he landed in that island, and, in a short time, he seemed to be regarded as politically dead to Em-ope. But it soon became apparent that the Bourbons had not discovered the secret of governing in accordance with the spirit of the age. During the twenty years of their exile, \" they had learnt nothing, and forgot nothing.\" All the legislative changes that had taken place during their absence they affected to regard as the work of violence, usurpation, and injustice, and, with incredible folly, set about reviving superstitions that had become ridiculous, and forms of government that were detestable. Napoleon anxiously watched the progress of events ; and, having learned that the ministers of Louis XVHL had proposed to the Congress of Vienna to remove him from Elba in order to send him to St Helena, he conceived the bold project of returning to France. 33. His preparations were rapidly made, and, after a passage of"], [313, "A. D. 1815.] 277 GEORGE in. five days, he landed without opposition at Cannes, on the 1st of March 1815. Grenoble was the nearest fortress, and he lost no time in directing his march on that place, which opened its gates to receive him. The enthusiasm of the troops knew no bounds. His march to Paris was throughout, a triumphal procession. In twenty days this new revolution was terminated, without having cost a single drop of blood. Amidst the acclamations of the soldiers and the multitude, Napoleon was reinstated on the throne of France. Bo naparte was now anxious to obtain peace on the terms which had been offered to him at Chatillon, but peace was denied him on any terms. Nothing therefore remained but to commit the future des tiny of Em-ope to the arbitrement of arms. The most active pre parations were accordingly made on both sides. Various attempts were made to open a negotiation with the allies, but all proved abortive ; and, as Napoleon had no intention to await the onset of his enemies, he resolved to fall upon the Anglo-Prussian army before the troops of Austria or Russia could be in a condition to take part in the conflict. Accordingly, he set out from Paris on the 12th of June, passed the frontier of Belgium on the 15th, and on the following day advanced to Fleurus, where he discovered the Prussians ranged in order of battle between St Amand and Sombref. Ney had received orders to push forward with 42,000 men, by the Brussels road as far as Qnatre Bras, and there to keep the English in check, and prevent them from advancing to the aid of the Prussians, whom Napoleon proposed to attack. The battle of Ligny followed, in which the Prussians were completely defeated, and Grouchy was detached in pursuit of them with 35,000 men, while Napoleon pro ceeded to turn his efforts against Wellington. On the night of the 16th the British general was at Quatre Bras, but the retreat of Blucher compelled him to make a corresponding retrograde move ment, in order to keep up a communication with the Prussians, and to retire on the 17th towards Waterloo, where the allied army took np a position on a chain of heights, two miles in front of the village. Napoleon arrayed his forces on another chain of heights, opposite to the position of the allies, from which it was separated by a ravine, half a mile in breadth. The battle began about ten o'olock on the morning of the 18th of June, and raged with the utmost fury till seven in the evening, when the last desperate charge of the French imperial guards was repulsed, and the British commander, seizing the favourable moment, directed his line to advance and act on the offensive. At this critical juncture, the Prussians, who had suc ceeded in out-marching Grouchy, arrived on the field of battle, and falling on the flank and rear of the enemy, completed the victory. The French army was not only defeated, but totally dispersed."], [314, "[A. D. 1816. 278 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. During the successive actions on the 16th, 17th, and 18th, forty thousand of the French were killed, while three hundred pieces of cannon and fourteen thousand prisoners fell into the hands of the allies. The loss of the Prassians amounted to sixteen thousand, that of the British and Hanoverians to thirteen thousand. 34. On the 21st Bonaparte returned to Paris, in the hope that the national spirit might be roused to defend the country against another foreign invasion. But he soon found that he had deceived nimself, and in a short time was compelled to sign a second abdica tion. He then decided to retire to America, and, with this view, he set out for Rochefort, where he arrived on the 3d of July. Find ing it impossible, however, to put to sea, he took the resolution of throwing himself upon the generosity of the Prince Regent of Eng land, and, on the 15th, embarked on board of the Bellerophon in Aix Roads. He was not, however, permitted to land in England, but, by a formal decision of the English Government, was sent a3 a prisoner of war to St Helena, where he pined away in hopeless exile until death put an end to his misery, on the 3d of May 1821. 35. The transition from war to peace produced a great derange ment in the economical relations of the country. There was a rapid fall in wages and profits, great embarrassment in trade, and conse quently, extensive distress among the people. A corn-bill was passed amid great excitement, which was aggravated by unfavour able harvests and scanty employment ; and the high price of provi sions, combined with low wages, caused very general discontent, especially in the manufacturing districts. In these circumstances, political agitation sprung up, and vast assemblages of people were held in the open air for the purpose of setting forth their grievances, and urging the necessity of a reform in the constitution of the coun try. This led to the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act ; sus pected persons were imprisoned, and the press was silenced by pro secutions. Towards the close of 1817, and throughout 1818, the excitement subsided in consequence of the temporary revival of trade, but the commercial disasters which took place about the end of 1818 and during the course of 1819, renewed the political agita tion with redoubled violence. Large assemblages took place in most of the towns in the manufacturing districts, which were ac companied with violence, and, in some instances, with loss of life. 36. The only memorable event abroad interesting to this country during the period to which we have refened, was the bombardment of Algiers by a British fleet under Lord Exmouth, on the 27th of August 1816. The piratical practices of the States of Barbary had long given offence to the Christian powers of Europe, till, at length, the imprisonment of our consul by the government of Algiers, and"], [315, "A. D. 1820.] GEORGE TV. 279 the massacre of the crews of some Neapolitan and Corsican vessels which were under the protection of our flag, brought down the ven geance of the British empire. Lord Exmouth was immediately despatched with a powerful squadron to demand the immediate liberation of all Christian slaves, and the renunciation for ever of the practice of reducing to slavery the subjects of the Christian powers of Europe. To these demands no answer was returned, and the bombardment commenced at three o'clock in the afternoon of the 27th, and continued till nine in the evening. The batteries, shipping, arsenal, and magazine, and two-thirds of the city, being completely destroyed, the Dey gave his unqualified assent to the propositions which he had before scorned even to entertain. 37. On the 22d of November 1817, the Princess Charlotte, the only child of the prince regent, and consort of Prince Leopold, died, in the twenty-second year of her age, after giving birth to a still born child. The sndden death of this accomplished and high-spirited princess excited universal and intense sonow. On the 29th of December 1820, George HI. expired, in the eighty-second year of his age, and the sixtieth of his reign. He was succeeded by his son George IV., who had virtually discharged all the offices of king for nearly eight years. CHAPTER XXVI. A. D. 1820 to 1837. George IV. \u2014 William IV. CHRONOLOGY OF THE PERIOD A. D. 1821. Napoleon Bonaparte died at St Helena. 1825. Charles X., King of France. 1826. Donna Maria, Queen of Portugal. 1830. Louis Philippe, King of the French. A.

Soon after the commencement of the new reign a diabolical conspiracy was discovered to assassinate the ministers when assem bled at a cabinet-dinner at Lord Hanowby's. The leader was a person of the name of Thistlewood, who had been reduced by his profligate habits to a state of abject poverty. The conspirators were surprised in a hay-loft in Cato Street, where they held then meetings, on the same evening on which the massacre of the mini sters was to have been perpetrated. After a desperate resistance,"], [316, "[A. D. 1824. 280 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. in which one police-officer was killed, and several severely wounded, the greater part of the band was apprehended. Five of them suf fered the penalty annexed to high treason on the 29th of April. 2. At this period great discontent prevailed, especially among the manufacturing classes of the community, and spies were liberally dispersed throughout the disaffected districts, by whose machina tions partial risings took place in various parts of the country. About fifty individuals assembled at Bonnymuir, near Kilsyth, some of whom were armed with pikes, and some with pistols or muskets. They were dispersed by a troop of cavahy, and nineteen of them captured. Three of these misled individuals were afterwards exe cuted, and the rest transported. 3. For the remainder of the year public attention was almost exclusively fixed on an investigation into the conduct of the queen. Her majesty was accused of unfaithfulness to her marriage bed, and a bill of pains aud penalties founded on this charge was brought into the House of Lords, to divorce her and degrade her from her rank. After long and fierce discussions, however, the ministry were ultimately compelled to withdraw the bill. The introduction of this measure caused intense excitement throughout the countiy. The popular enthusiasm in behalf of the queen was very great. The private character of the king, the shameful treatment the queen had received from the time of her marriage, and the persecution to which she had been exposed, a\"ll contributed powerfully to excite public feeling in her favour. On the 7th of August 1821, this un fortunate princess expired in the fifty-third year of her age. 4. The year 1822 was rendered memorable by the visit of the king to Scotland \u2014 the first occasion since the Revolution on which that country had been honoured by a visit from her sovereign. His Majesty landed at Leith on the 15th of August, and re-embarked at Queensferry on the 27th. The intervening period was spent in a variety of festivities ; and the vast multitudes assembled from all parts of the country received his majesty with the most rapturous demonstrations of loyalty. 5. During the year 1824 the countiy was in a state of unexampled prosperity. There was a regular demand for labour, and wages were rising. Manufactures of ever)' kind were in a prosperous con dition. The great abundance of capital led to many devices for its employment, and the low rate of interest induced capitalists to seek foreign investments with such eagerness, that there was scarcely a state in the Old and New World to which loans were not advanced by this country. The rage for joint-stock companies spread through every department of domestic industry. Every day gave birth to new projects ; many of them of the most preposterous kind. The"], [317, "A. D. 1829.] GEORGE IV. 281 wildest anticipations of profit were indulged. The nation, intoxi cated with the sudden increase of its mercantile transactions, was preparing for itself a sudden and tremendous reflux of its spring-tide of prosperity, and it was not long before the reverses which might have been anticipated took place. 6. On the first symptoms of a reaction, the bank, in conformity with the established policy, diminished its issues and discounts. Merchants immediately became pressed for funds. A most over whelming revulsion took place in the monetary and commercial in terests of the country during the close of 1825 and the early part of 1826. The number of failures was unprecedented. The mer cantile classes were unable to meet their engagements, while the artisans were thrown out of employment and exposed to famine, so that ruin and misery were widely spread throughout the community. 7. The almost universal distress which pervaded the nation oc cupied the attention of the Legislature during the session of 1826, and measures were taken to provide as far as possible against the recurrence of a similar calamity. On the 17th of February 1826, Lord Liverpool, the first lord of the treasury, was struck with apo plexy ; and, on the 10th of April, Mr Canning received the royal commands to form an administration. The Duke of Wellington and the great majority of his colleagues having refused to act under Mr Canning as premier, that distinguished individual was obliged to form a government of the more liberal portion of the Tories, with Lord Lansdowne and others of the Whig party. Great expectations were formed from an administration constructed on this basis ; but these hopes were all blasted by the death of Mr Canning, on the 8th of August 1827. The cabinet he had collected did not long survive him ; Lord Goderich, who was placed at its head, was unable to keep together the discordant materials of which it was composed, and it was dissolved by his resignation on the 8th of January 1828. 8. On the 6th of July 1827, a treaty was signed at London by the ministers of Britain, France, and Russia, for the purpose of put ting an end to the sanguinary war between the Turks and the in surgent Greeks ; and, on the 20th of October, the fleets of the com bined powers annihilated the Turkish fleet in the Bay of Navarino. 9. In the meantime, the state of Ireland had become exceedingly critical. The demand for Catholic emancipation was daily growing more violent, and was supported by a formidable organization which extended over the whole country. At length it seemed to the ministry that the only way to avert civil war was to concede the claims made by the Roman Catholics ; and, in the beginning of 1829, a bill was brought into parliament, abolishing the civil dis tinctions which had hitherto existed between them and the other m2"], [318, "282 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. [A. D- 1837. classes of his Majesty's' subjects. The measure was carried through both houses of parliament, and received the royal assent on the 13 th of April. The ceding of the Catholic claims was the last important act of tlie reign of George IV. He expired on the 26th of June 1830, in the sixty-eighth year of his age, and was succeeded by bis brother William IV. 10. In the summer of 1830, a second revolution broke out in France. The French king and his ministry having attempted to de stroy the charter by an illegal mandate issued July 26th, an insur rection broke out in the city of Paris, and, after three days' fighting, in which considerable numbers both of the citizens and soldiers were killed and wounded, the people proved victorious, the elder branch of the Bourbons was expelled from France, and Louis Philippe, Duke of Orleans, was called to the throne. The spirit of resist ance extended also to Belgium, and an insurrection broke out in the capital, which ultimately led to the separation of that country from the United Provinces. 11. Meanwhile, the events which were passing on the Continent excited deep interest in this country, and a strong sympathy was manifested with the triumph which the French people had obtained over the attempt to destroy their constitution. The desire for in novation was greatly increased by the successful issue of this popu lar commotion, and a vehement demand for a reform in our own constitution was everywhere raised. Incendiarism spread rapidly throughout the agricultural districts, and the aspect of public affairs became exceedingly alarming. It was speedily made apparent that the government had lost the confidence of the country, and was not possessed of the wisdom and firmness necessary to meet the threat ening emergency. Both Whigs and Tories, therefore, concurred in their opposition to its measures, and being lest in a minority in the House of Commons, the Duke of Wellington resigned his office on the 16th of November 1830. Earl Grey was immediately appointed to form a new administration, on the principles of \" peace, retrench ment, and reform.\" Accordingly, a plan of parliamentary reform was introduced into the House of Commons by the new ministry on the 1st of March 1831. During the progress of the measure through the legislature, the greatest excitement prevailed throughout the country. The bill met with a strenuous resistance in both houses of parliament, but the great mass of the community declared une quivocally in its favour. Alarming riots broke out in various places, especially in Bristol and Nottingham, and were not suppressed with out considerable loss of both property and life. The bill was once thrown out by the House of Lords, and was several times in danger of being lost or mutilated ; but, ultimately, the efforts of its sup-"], [319, "A. D. 1837.] 283 WILLIAM TV. porters were crowned with success, and the royal assent was given to this important measure on the 7th of June 1832. 12. The new constitution of the imperial parliament was thus, after an arduous struggle, completely established. A considerable number of decayed boroughs were disfranchised, and many great and populous towns received the franchise in their stead. Non-re sident voters were deprived of their privilege, and every householder in the cities and boroughs rated at ten pounds a-year of rent receiv ed the right of voting. The county representation was entirely re modelled, and the county constituency greatly extended. Similar measures were soon afterwards introduced for the purpose of reform ing the representation in Scotland and Ireland. The Scottish reform bill received the royal assent, July 17th. It made an addition of eight members to the representation of that country, and confened the elective franchise in the counties on the owners of heritable pro perty of the yearly value of L.10, and in the towns on the ten pound householders. 13. During the first session of the reformed parliament, various social and economical reforms took place. The most important of these was the total abolition of colonial slavery, which was to ter minate in every shape on the 1st of August 1840. The sum of L. 20,000,000 was voted by the legislature as a compensation to the owners of the slaves. The royal and parliamentary burghs of Scotland were also reformed, and their management placed on a more popular basis. The trade with China and India was thrown open, and various important changes were made in the government of our possessions in the East. In the subsequent sessions, many practical abuses were removed ; a remedy was provided for the ma nifold evils of the English poor-law system ; the municipal corpora tions of England and Wales were reformed, and various other acts passed which were calculated to promote the internal prosperity of the country. 14. On the 20th of June 1837, King William died, in the 73d year of his age, and the seventh of his reign, and was succeeded by the Princess Victoria, daughter of the Duke of Kent. During the period that has elapsed since the accession of the sovereign, nume rous measures have been adopted for the relief of trade and com merce, and for the improvement of the condition of the people and the prosperity of the country ; but as these events are of very recent occurrence, it is unnecessary to give any detailed account of them in a sketch like the present."], [320, "284 CHAPTER XXVH. Statistics. 1. Scotland, the northern division of Great Britain, is situated between 64\u00b0 38' and 58\u00b0 41' north latitude, and between 1\u00b0 47' and 6\u00b0 7' west longitude ; having the sea on all sides except the south, where it is separated from England, partly by the Tweed and other streams, and partly by a line supposed to be drawn along the high grounds in that quarter. The longest line that can be drawn, in about the same parallel of longitude, is from the Mull of Galloway in Wigtonshire to Cape Wrath in Sutherland, a distance of about 274 miles, though Dunnethead in Caithness-shire is the most north erly point. The breadth varies from 147 miles to about 30 ; the greatest breadth being between Buchanness on the coast of Aber deenshire, and the Rowanmoan Point on the west coast of Ross shire, while between Alloa on the Frith of Forth and Dumbarton on the Clyde, the distance is only 3 2 miles, and between Lochbroom and the Frith of Dornoch, it is rather less than 30. The area of Scot land contains 32,167 square miles, of which 494 square miles consist of fresh water lakes. This is the extent of the mainland, inclusive of the islands on the west, known by the name of the Hebrides or Western Isles, and those of Orkney and Zetland on the north, which altoge ther are computed to extend over 4224 square miles, of which 144 consist of fresh water lakes. Including these islands, the northern limit of Scotland stretches beyond the 61st degree of latitude, and its longitude lies between the meridian of London and 8\u00b0 18' west ; its area being computed to comprehend 29,744 square miles, of which the fresh water lakes occupy 638 square miles, or about one forty eighth part of the whole. 2. The outline on the sea-coast is exceedingly irregular, and of great extent, the sea penetrating to a great depth, both on its east ern and western sides. Of these arms of the sea, the most consi derable are the Friths of Forth and Tay, and the Moray and Dor noch Friths, on the east ; and the Frith of Clyde and the Luce and Wigton Bays, on the west and south-west ; whilst there are a very great number of smaller inlets, called lochs, which indent the coun tiy in all directions, to an extent varying from 10 to 70 miles. With this of outline is combined a surface generally ragged and mountainous. With the exception of nanow tracts along its principal rivers, there is very little of the country flat or level, or what would be regarded as productive land in more favoured re-"], [321, "APPEARANCE.] STATISTICS. 285 gions. In the south of Scotland, a tract of mountainous country, known by various names, stretches in a south-west direction, from the Cheviot hills in Roxburghshire, on the borders of England, to the Irish channel, sending off branches on both sides, while detach ed hills prevail over the whole of the contiguous districts. These high grounds, however, are for the most part green, almost to then summits, and have little of that wild, romantic, and desolate cha racter, which distinguishes many of the mountains of the Highlands. Northward from the isthmus formed by the Friths of Forth and Clyde, the low grounds constitute but a small proportion of the whole. Here, in latitude 57\u00b0, the Grampians extend from sea to sea, with a breadth of from forty to sixty miles ; and parallel to them, to the south, is another chain, called the Sidlaw, Ochils, and Campsie hills. Between these two ranges lies the fertile valley of Strathmore. Farther north, cultivation is mostly confined to the sea-coast, the banks of the larger rivers, and the nan-ow glens be tween the mountains. On the north-west, beyond the line of the Caledonian canal, the countiy is, with few exceptions, singularly rugged and sterile ; consisting of lofty mountains, either covered with heath, or presenting a mass of naked rocks, intenupted only by deep and dark ravines, lakes, and precipitous streamlets. But the eastern coast of Ross-shire is comparatively level and fertile ; and Caithness, the north-eastern county of the mainland of Scot land, is generally low, marshy, and unproductive. 3. Scotland is divided into Highlands and Lowlands. The line which separates these districts is by no means well defined ; but it may be described as beginning at Dumbarton, on the Frith of Clyde, whence proceeding northward by Crieff, Dunkeld, and Blairgowrie, it runs through the forest of Morven, in the heights of Aberdeen, to Carron, in Banffshire ; from Carron it stretches due west by Tar naway, in Morayshire, to the town of Nairn ; from Nairn the line is continuous to Inverness ; and from this latter place it proceeds in a tortuous direction to Dunistra, on the south side of the Frith of Dornoch, where the line of separation may be said to terminate, the country to the north of this frith being altogether Highland, ex cept a narrow stripe of land along the shores of the German Ocean , which washes the east coast of Sutherland and Caithness. To the west of this line lie the Highlands, which, including the Hebrides, constitute, in superficial extent, nearly one-half of Scotland, although the inhabitants of this division do not form an eighth part of the popu lation. The face of the country is wild, rugged, desolate, and moun tainous. In almost every strath, valley, or glen, there glitters astream or lake; and numberless friths, or arms of the sea, penetrate the land. The passes into the Highlands lie in deep ravines or glens, so narrow,"], [322, "[CLIMATE. 286 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and so overhung by mountains, that they admit of being very easily defended ; and till recently, when roads have been made, they were impracticable almost to every one except the natives. 4. The climate of Scotland, as may be expected, from its high lati tude and insular situation, is cold, cloudy, and humid. This is its general character, as compared with the greater part of England ; yet, even in the south of England, frost is sometimes more intense, and snow falls more copiously, than in Scotland. Corn, however, and most of the fruits and vegetables common to both divisions of Great Britain, attain maturity about three weeks earlier in the south of England than in Scotland ; and some plants, such as hops, and a few others, cannot be profitably cultivated at all in the latter country. The mean annual temperature of Scotland is very high for the latitude, being about 4650 in places near the level of the sea. In the more southerly parts of the kingdom, the climate differs but little from that of the northern parts of England. The fall of rain is very different in different districts ; but the average is about 3 1 inches. The mean number of dry days throughout the year is, on the west coast, only 160; while on the east it is 230. The prevailing winds throughout Scotland are from the westerly points ; but on the east coast, it blows from the easterly points about a third of the year. The climate of Scotland is eminently salubrious. There are, properly speaking, no fens ormarshes. Thelow grounds are, in general, highly cultivated. From whatever point the wind may blow, except the east, a wide expanse of sea is passed over ; and the air, though moist, is purified from injurious emanations, which are readily absorbed by the ocean. Hence, it has been affirmed, that the mean duration of life is greater in Scotland than in almost any other country. 5. The mountains of Scotland consist either of detached groups, more or less closely wedged together, or of ridges or chains. These latter may be characterised as running in a north-east and south west direction. The Grampians, the most celebrated chain, extend from the south-eastern boundaries of Argyleshire, with a more or less defined line, to the heart of Aberdeenshire. This chain may be regarded as a natural rampart, forming the south-eastern boundary of the Highlands. With the exception of Ben Nevis, now fixed by the trigonometrical survey to be 4,406 feet high above the level of the sea, and therefore the highest in Great Britain, the principal mountains in Scotland are comprehended in the Grampian range. Another chain, to the south of the Grampians, and nearly parallel to them, stretches from Montrose to the Clyde, in Dumbartonshire ; but being intersected by the Tay and the Forth, it is divided into three distinct portions, which bear different names. From Montrose, to the Tay, this chain is called the Sidlaw hills ; from the Tay to"], [323, "MOUNTAINS, &C] STATISTICS. 287 the Forth, it is known by the name of the Ochils ; and the remain der passes under the names of the Dundaff, Fintry, and Campsie hills. The low country, or strath, which separates this range of hills from the Grampians, is called Strathmore, or the great valley. There is also a chain of mountains in the south of Scotland, stretch ing from the Cheviot hills, on the borders of Northumberland, to Loch Ryan, in Wigtonshire. There are other smaller ranges, such as the Monagh Lea mountains, which run parallel to and along the western side of the Spey ; the Lomond hills, in Fifeshire; the Pent land hills, in Mid-Lothian, and others. 6. In the neighbourhood of the village of Leadhills, in Lanark shire, 1564 feet above the level of the sea, is the highest cultivated land in Scotland. In Aberdeenshire, land is sometimes cultivated at the height of about 1300 feet ; but, with few exceptions, an elevation of 600 feet seems to be the limit of the tillage lands of Scotland. None of the Scottish mountains ascend to the line of perpetual congelation ; yet snow may be found all the year round in some of the dark recesses, on which the sun never shines. 7. From the ragged and mountainous character of the surface of Scotland, the vales or level tracts cannot be expected to be exten sive or numerous. They are, indeed, when compared with England, very much the reverse. Of these vales, called sometimes straths or carses, the following are the most important. The vale or carse of Stirling and Falkirk, the vale of the Earn, the carse of Gowrie, Strathmore, the Meree or level lands of Berwickshire, the carse of Baldoon, and the howe of Fife. These lands are either loamy or alluvial. 8. Scotland contains extensive tracts of land composed of moras ses, intermixed with rocks, lakes, and peat-moss. The principal of these are, the moor of Rannoch, the wilds of Sutherlandshire, Lam mermnir in Berwickshire, and the flow of Glenluce. 9. From the ragged and mountainous nature of the country, the rivers of Scotland are characterized by a more rapid course, are more diversified by rocks and cataracts, and are more limpid than those of England. Their course is also necessarily shorter, and few of them are navigable, at least to any great extent. Being gene rally mountain streams, they are peculiarly liable to sudden over flowings, their rise and fall being equally sudden. 10. The principal rivers of Scotland, with the single exception of the Clyde, are exclusively confined to the east. Three inconside rable rivers flow in a south-easterly direction, the Dee, which falls into the Solway Frith about six miles south of Kirkcudbright, and is navigable for small vessels two miles above that town ; the Nith, which rises in the north of Dumfriesshire, and falls into the Solway"], [324, "[RIVERS. 288 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Frith more than seven miles below Dumfries, being navigable to within two miles of that place ; and the Annan, which rises near Moffat, falls into the same estuary at the town of Annan, and is not navigable beyond that burgh. The rivers which flow in a northerly or north-easterly direction, are the Ness, which flows from Loch Ness, and, after a short course, falls into the Moray Frith near In verness ; the Findhorn, which, rising in the Monagh Lea mountains, falls into the same estuary at Findhorn, after a winding course of upwards of fifty miles ; and the Spey, the most rapid of the Scottish rivers, which flows from Loch Spey towards the west of Inverness shire, and, after receiving innumerable tributaries, and traversing the best wooded portion of the Highlands, falls into the Moray Frith. With the exception of the Ayr, which is not navigable, and falls into the sea at the town of the same name, the only river on the west coast worth mentioning, is the Clyde, which, in a manufactur ing and commercial point of view, is the most important stream in Scotland. It rises on the west of the Moffat mountains, and, after a circuitous course of nearly eighty miles, falls into the Frith of Clyde below Dumbarton. It receives various tributaries, and is navigable to Glasgow, passing, in its course, several of the principal manufacturing and commercial towns in Scotland \u2014 Glasgow, Ha milton, Lanark, Port-Glasgow, and Greenock. All the other rivers are on the east coast, namely, the Tweed, the Forth, the Tay, the North and South Esk, the Dee, and the Don. The Tweed rises near the sources of the Annan and Clyde, and, running past Peebles through a beautiful pastoral country, falls into the German ocean at Berwick-upon-Tweed, after a winding course of about 100 miles. The Forth rises on the east of Ben Lomond, and, receiving the wa ters of the Teith and the Allan, it becomes a considerable stream at Stirling, to which the tide flows, and to which it is navigable for vessels of about seventy tons. From Stirling to Alloa is only six miles by land, but the sinuosities of the river are so tortuous, that it is no less than sixteen by water. The river may here be said to terminate in the Frith, which extends to the German ocean, a dis tance of forty miles. The Tay rises to the north of Loch Lomond ; and, expanding into the romantic sheet of water, called Loch Tay, flows in a circuitous route past Dunkeld, and Perth, and falls into the Frith of Tay at the confluence of its waters with the Earn, about twenty miles from the mouth of the estuary. It is navigable to Dundee for vessels of 500 tons burthen, and to Perth for those of 200 tons. The Tay is the largest of the Scottish, and, in respect to the volume of water it conveys to the sea, even of the British rivers. The North and South Esk have their source in the Grampians, and fall into the sea at Montrose, within three miles of each other. The"], [325, "LAKES.] STATISTICS. 289 basin of Montrose, through which the South Esk flows, and which bounds the town on the west, comprehends about 2000 acres of land ; it is covered by water at full sea, and exhibits nothing but bare sand at ebb tide. The Dee and the Don have also their rise in the Gram pians, and fall into the sea, the former at New Aberdeen, and the latter at Old Aberdeen. 11. The fresh water lakes in Scotland occupy an area of 638 square miles, or cover an aggregate extent of 408,320 English sta tute acres. The only counties that are devoid of lakes are those of Berwick, Clackmannan, the Lothians, and Peebles ; while those of Roxburgh amount to only 320 English acres. The greatest extent of lakes is in Inverness-shire, Argyllshire, Ross-shire, Perthshire, and Sutherlandshire. The lakes, generally speaking, occupy the valleys or ravines amongst the mountains, and are thus distinguish ed for their length, their breadth being comparatively trifling. The only Lowland lakes worth specifying are Loch Leven, St Mary's Loch, and Loch Ken. The other lakes are all north of the Friths of Clyde and Forth. Loch Lomond is the most celebrated, as well as the largest, lake in Scotland ; indeed, it is the largest in the Bri tish dominions. This noble sheet of water is about twenty-four miles in length ; its greatest breadth is ten miles, but towards its upper part it is not more than half a mile broad. Its depth varies from 120 to 720 feet, and it is deepest towards the north. The islands are about thirty in number, and ten of them are of consider able extent ; Inchmurrin, the largest, being two miles in length and one in breadth. Some of them, particularly Inchniurrin, are stock ed with deer. Loch Katrin lies in the district of Menteith, Perth shire, and is one of the most romantic in Scotland. Its length is eight miles, and its greatest breadth less than one. 12. In a general point of view, Scotland may be separated, geo logically as well as geographically, into three portions. By pass ing a line on the map from Stonehaven to the Mull of Cantire, we trace the southern boundary of the primary non-fossiliferous system of rocks. Another line, drawn from St Abb's Head in Berwickshire, passing near Peebles, Sanquhar, and New Cumnock, to the south of Girvan on the western coast, forms the northern boundary of the old greywacke or Cumbrian system : while the land included be tween the two lines comprehends the old red sandstone, and great central basin of Scotland. 13. That extensive tract of Scotland which constitutes the north ern division, is composed chiefly of gneiss, mica-slate, chlorite-slate, and clay-slate, with subordinate masses of hornblende-slate, talc slate, and primitive limestone, in none of which have organic re mains ever been discovered. These, with granitic centres, often rise N"], [326, "[geology. 290 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. into magnificent mountains, of which the Grampians form a part. The preceding, however, are not the only stratified formations which constitute this extensive district. The old red sandstone fringes in various places the extremities of the land, or is deposited in patches on the gneiss formation, expands over the whole breadth of Caith ness, and constitutes the principal formation of the Orkney isles. 14. In this division of Scotland very few metallic ores have been found. Lead mines are at present wrought at Tyndrum, to the west of Loch Tay, and at Stronbean in Argyleshire, at which place the carbonate of strontian was discovered. At Glen Strathfarrar, in Inverness-shire, there have been detected veins of plumbago, run ning between the lamin\u00e6 of the mica slate. 15. Off the north-west side of Mull there are five basaltic islands, of which the smallest, but the most celebrated, is Staffa, which is well known for its columns and cavern, called Fingal's cave. This cave is one of the most remarkable natural excavations in the world. The top of the arch, at the entrance, is sixty-six feet : but it gra dually declines to forty at the extremity at the distance of 227 feet. The breadth of the cave is about forty feet. There are other similar caverns of less note on the island. The basalt of which the columns in Staffa are composed is similar to that of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland ; and it is probable that they are both of submarine ori gin, having been raised by the sea. 1 6 . The greater part of the area of the south of Scotland is co vered with the old greywacke or Cumbrian rocks, which are also destitute of organic remains. These greywacke strata stand at high angles of from sixty to ninety degrees, and consist chiefly of coarse slaty strata, seldom divisible into thin roofing slates, and often alternating with arenaceous and coarse conglomerates. Amongst them limestone is seldom found, and, when it is, the qua lity of it is inferior. In this division of the island, coal and its ac companiments are known in few places ; is is, however, wrought at Canonby, near Langholm, and at the Carter Fell. The only other rock formation found in this district, with the exception of igneous rocks, is a red sandstone, ascertained, in some situations, to be the old red, but in others, considered as the new red sandstone, par ticularly in Dumfriesshire. 17. In the third geological division of Scotland, namely, the centre of the kingdom, the most ancient rock is the old red sand stone. This rock abuts against the line of the primary rocks, and stretches across the whole country from the German ocean to the Atlantic, pursuing, like the mountain ranges, a south-westerly to north- easterly direction. Its line forms a long, uninterrupted, ex tensive, and fertile valley. In the north-western part, it rises into"], [327, "GEOLOGY.] 291 STATISTICS. hills, on the sides of one of which, east of Menteith, are deep and hideous fissures, the effect of some convulsion of the earth. The formation appears to be of vast thickness, especially towards the north, and may, it is supposed, be divided into three portions, the lower, the middle, and the upper beds. In what are considered as the lower strata, the remains of fishes have been found in a high state of preservation. The well-known Arbroath pavement belongs to the old red sandstone series. 18. But the most important group in this central district is the coal formation, consisting of limestone, ironstone, freestone, coal, and clays. The extent from east to west is bounded only by the extremities of the land. To the north, it is cut off from the old red sandstone by a range of trap hills, crossing the country from east to west. On the south, it is bounded by the greywacke and the old red sandstone. Its breadth, extending on both sides of the Forth and Clyde, averages forty miles, and its length about seventy miles. 19. The mountain limestone forms generally the basis of the group, although it is frequently found interstratified with other members of the series, and abounds with great numbers of organic remains. Below the mountain limestone, however, but belonging to the same group, a bed of limestone is worked at Burdiehouse, near Edinburgh, in which the organic remains differ essentially from those which have been just named. These remains consist of many of the plants which distinguish the coal formation ; but that alluded to includes also the teeth, scales, and other bones of fishes which partake of the reptile character, some of which must have been of gigantic dimensions. Small fishes are also found in a fine state of preservation. The same limestone has been found in other parts of the country, and is of superior quality to the common lime stone, for mortar, plaster, and the smelting of iron. 20. The clay limestone is found in beds and nodules, the work able kind containing from twenty-seven to forty-five per cent, of iron. The kind termed black-band is in high request. From this ore is smelted vast quantities of pig-iron. The iron works in Scot land, at Gartsherrie, Dundyvan, Monkland, Carron, Shotts, Cle land, Airdrie, Glasgow, and other places, have been increasing beyond all example. In 1825 there were 25 furnaces ; in 1840, 70 furnaces ; in 1848, 130 furnaces ; and in 1851, 142 furnaces. The total quantity produced per annum is now about 100,000 tons, and with the exception of one furnace at Carron, it is all made by means of heated air, or the hot blast, as it is called. This great increase was principally owing to the demand for railways. These works are mostly in Lanarkshire, within ten or a dozen miles of Glasgow, and in Ayrshire."], [328, "[canals. 292 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 21. The coal is found in beds varying from a few inches to forty feet in thickness, is extracted in great quantity, and 13 used as fuel, both for domestic and manufacturing purposes. One variety, cannel coal, is of superior quality for the preparation of gas. From the fire-clay are manufactured fire-brick and gas retorts; and the sandstone fur nishes an inexhaustible store of substantial and beautiful material for building. The number of collieries in Scotland in 1851 was 268. 22. These several deposits contain, in abundance, the impressions of the vegetables which distinguish the carboniferous period ; and what is remarkable, the remains of animals, the same as occur in the Burdiehouse limestone, are found in the shales, and even in the coal itself. In the island no strata newer than the carboniferous system are known to exist. All is covered over with accumulations of clay, gravel, sand, and soil. 23. Until aster the middle of last century, there was scarcely a good road in Scotland : but carriage roads now extend over every part of the countiy ; and in consequence of the excellent materials which abound in all parts of Scotland, and of the greater skill and science of Scottish trustees and surveyors, the turnpike roads in Scotland are superior to those in England. 24. The Caledonian canal, the greatest work of the kind ever at tempted in Great Britain, stretches south-west and north-east across the land, from a point near Inverness to Fort- William, a distance of 60^ miles, including Lochs Ness, Oich, and Lochy, by which nearly two-thirds of it are formed. The excavated or artificial part is twenty-three miles ; and there are in all twenty locks. The Crinan canal is situated in Argyleshire, and is intended to afford a communi cation between Loch Gilp and the Western ocean, so as to avoid the difficult and circuitous passage round the Mull of Cantire. It is nine miles long, and twelve feet deep, admitting vessels of 200 tons bur then. The Forth and Clyde canal, sometimes called the Great canal, though begun in 1768, was not finally completed till 1790. The length from Grangemouth on the Forth, to Bowling bay on the Clyde, is 35 miles, and, including the lateral branch to Port- Dundas, Glasgow, 38 J. Its depth is ten feet ; and it has in all thirty nine locks. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Union canal, which was finished in 1822, stretches from Port-Hopetoun, Edinburgh, until it joins the Forth and Clyde canal at Port-Downie, near Falkirk, a dis tance of 31 J miles. Its depth is only five feet. The Monkland canal stretches from Glasgow to Woodhall, about two miles south-east of Airdrie, a distance of twelve miles, and communicates by a lateral branch with the Forth and Clyde canal at Port-Dundas. The Glas gow, Paisley, and Ardrossan canal has not been completed ; indeed,"], [329, "RENTAL, &C.] STATISTICS. 293 itTs not now intended tocomplete it. The Aberdeenshire canal, com pleted in 1807, stretches from the harbour of Aberdeen to Inverury. The length is 18^ miles, and the number of locks is seventeen. 25. Railways now supersede other modes of travelling through the interior of the country. The first act obtained in 1808, for a railway in Scotland, was for that between Kilmarnock and Troon. In 1851 there were nine railways in Scotland, extending 961 miles in length, and employing 8,802 persons. The number of passengers conveyed was 9,286,312, and the total receipts from all sources of traffic was L.I, 436, 602. A system of railway communication has thus been completed, so as to unite the most remote districts of the country by a cheap and rapid mode of travelling. 26. The total extent of land in Scotland is 20,047,462 statute acres, but of thisquantityonlyaboutafourth part, or 5,01 1,865 acres, are cultivated ; the remaining 6,062,000 being uncultivated, and 9,039,930acres being unprofitable. Even of this small proportion of cultivated land, however, nearly a half, or 2,489,725 acres, is esti mated to be in grass. The average value of the land under cultivation is estimated at L.13,355,875, and the average value of the arable soils in pasture, therefore, at L.4,979,450. There are 1 4,000,000 acres of mountain pasture, waste land, and plantation, which, at an average rent of 3s. per acre, will be L.2, 100,000. Hence the total annual value of the land produce in Scotland will be L.20,435,325. 27. Most of the land is rented by tenants, only about a tenth part being supposed to be farmed by the landowners. The exact amount of the rental of Scotland cannot be known. The rental for 1810, in cluding mines, fisheries, quarries, and the like, was ascertained to be L.4,851,404 ; anditis supposed that, though considerable variations have taken place in different districts, therental of Scotland continues at nearly the same amount; for although many of the rents contracted for, during the last years of the late war, have been greatly reduced, yet others, from the falling in of the older leases, have been propor tionably advanced. Rent, we may here remark, has advanced more in Scotland, during the last seventy years, than perhaps in any old set tled country during a similar period. The entire rental of Scotland is not supposed to have exceeded L.I, 000, 000, or L.I, 200, 000, in 1770. In 1795, it is believed to have been at least L.2, 000, 000; and since that time it has a good deal more than doubled. 28. Both the law and the practice of Scotland are favourable to agricultural enterprise. What in England are termed \" tenants at will,\" or tenants without alease, are unknown in this portion of the empire. Leases in Scotland may be said to be universal, extending to fifteen, nineteen, or twenty-one years. It was not uncommon, indeed, about fifty years ago, And before that time, to give liferents."], [330, "[LAW COURTS. 294 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. or leases for twice nineteen years, or even longer, a circumstance highly favourable to enterprise on the part of the tenant. With the exception of some districts in the Highlands and Islands, the system of small farms has been abandoned, and has given way to farms of great extent, rented by persons of intelligence and capital. There are no tithes. Before the passing of the poor-law act (1845), poor-rates were entirely unknown in about three-fourths of the pa rishes of Scotland ; and where this assessment did exist, it was of comparatively trifling amount. 29. In a remote, and what may be termed the aboriginal period of our judicial annals, the king was chief justice of the kingdom ; and, with his council, made progress through the realm for the ad ministration of public justice. At that time, indeed, the king exe cuted in person the principal duties of government ; and it was not till comparatively recent times, that the different departments of the state began to be exclusively assigned to distinct and responsible officers. Until the period of the Revolution, the king claimed the right to take personal \" cognizance and decision of any cases or causes he pleased.\" But since that event, it has been deemed a settled part of the constitutional law of the land, that the king ha3 committed all judicial power to the judges, and cannot himself ad minister justice in the courts. 30. The supreme civil court of Scotland is called the Court of- Session. It holds, in Edinburgh, two sessions annually. The num ber of judges was formerly fifteen, but is now thirteen. They are styled Lords of Session, and sit in two courts or chambers, called the First and Second Divisions, which form, in effect, two courts ot equal and independent authority. The Court of Justiciary, the su preme criminal court of Scotland, consists at present of six judges, who are also judges of the Court of Session. The president of the court is the Lord Justice-General. The court holds sittings in Edin burgh during the recess of the Court of Session ; and twice a year, in the spring and autumn vacations, the judges hold circuits in the chief provincial towns, two going each circuit. There was formerly a Court of Exchequer, for the trial of cases connected with the re venue ; but it is now abolished as a separate establishment, and the duties are devolved on one of the judges of the Court of Session. There are also inferior courts of law, viz., the courts of the burghs, of the sheriffs, and of the justices of the peace. 31. Scotland is divided, for civil purposes, into counties or shires, and parishes. The counties are thirty-three in number, but several of them comprehend a variety of territorial divisions, founded on the natural circumstances of the country. Thus the county of Berwick is popularly divided into the three districts of the Merse,"], [331, "PARISHES.] STATISTICS. 295 Lauderdale, and Lammermnh- ; Lanarkshire into the upper, mid dle, and lower wards ; Ayrshire into Kyle, Cunningham, and Car rick ; and in the extensive Highland counties, the subdivisions are still more numerous. Respecting the date of the erection of parishes, there have been various conjectures. They were purely an ecclesiastical regulation, and could not have been formed till the Christian system had been generally received, and its preachers be come numerous ; and as this division, and the necessary previous ecclesiastical establishment, infer no inconsiderable degree of civili zation, it is highly probable that it did not take place before the ninth or tenth century. 32. Every parish in Scotland enjoys the privilege of having a resi dent clergyman. The number of parishes, according to the civil law, is 916 ; and of these 27 are collegiate, that is, have each the services of two clergymen, who preach alternately in the same place of worship. There is also a number of chapels in connection with the Established Church. The government of the church is vested in kirk-sessions, presbyteries, synods, and the General Assembly. The number of churches belonging to dissenters, of all denomina tions, amounts to upwards of 2000, besides a considerable number of missionary stations. 33. The subject of education engaged the attention of the Scottish parliament even in comparatively rude times, viz., as early as the year 1494. The Protestant church zealously took up the subject, and many acts of the General Assembly were passed in support of it. But it was not till 1616 that the Privy Council interposed and passed an act in favour of parish schools ; nor was it till seventeen years afterwards, that this act of council was ratified by parliament. The disturbed state of the times prevented the act from becoming operative ; and it was not, in truth, till some time after the Revolu tion, namely, in 1696, that the celebrated statute of William and Mary was passed, which forms the foundation of the present paro chial system. The provisions of this act were immediately carried into effect in most parishes ; and now the system is in universal operation throughout Scotland. The landowners and clergymen have it in their power, according to law, to establish more than one school in a parish, if circumstances seem to demand it ; in which case, the salary assigned to each of the teachers is less than the maximum sum (L.34 : 4 : 4\u00a3) given when there is only one school master in a parish. The number of parochial schools in Scotland is 1047; the number of teachers is 1170; the aggregate amount of the salaries paid to them is L.29,642 : 18 : 114 ; and their total income, including salaries, fees, and all other emoluments, but exclusive of their dwelling-houses and gardens, is L.55,339 : 17 : 1\u00a3, being an"], [332, "296 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. [UNIVERSITIES. average of only L.47 : 5 : llf to each teacher The number of schools not parochial, is not less than 3995, and the number of teachers 4469, being nearly four times the amount of the parochial schools and teachers. The greatest number of pupils attending the parochial schools between Ladyday and Michaelmas 1833, was 71,426 ; and the lowest number was 50,029. The greatest number attending the schools not parochial, between the same dates, was 189,427 ; and the lowest number was 139,237. Taking the average of the preceding number of pupils, attending both the parochial and non-parochial schools, namely, 225,061, the inference is, that 10J out of 100 of the population are at school ; but when we take into account the number of female seminaries, of private boarding schools for boys, and children taught in private families by governesses and tutors, not to mention Sabbath evening schools and classes for reli gious instruction, we may with propriety conclude, that at least 11\u00a3 out of every 100 of the population are at the same time under tuition. 34. The origin of the Scottish universities is not of any remote date. But as early as the year 1282, Dervorgille, wife of John Baliol, founded and endowed a college at Oxford for the reception of Scottish students ; and, in 1326, a college, known by the name of the Scotch College, was founded and endowed at Paris by David Murray, bishop of Moray, for a similar purpose. But at length Scotland enjoyed the advantages of universities within the limits of her own tenitory. That of St Andrews, the oldest in the kingdom, was founded by papal authority in 1413 ; that of Glasgow, by the same authority, in 1450 ; that of Aberdeen, also under the sanction of the pope, in 1494, though education did not commence there till 1500 ; and that of Edinburgh, founded by the presbyterians, in 1582. The university of St Andrews consisted at one time of three colleges, instituted at different periods, viz., St Salvador's, St Leonard's, and St Mary's ; but in 1748, the two first were united, and the buildings of St Leonard's were alienated and converted into dwelling-houses. The university of Aberdeen consists of two colleges ; King's, founded, as just stated, in 1494 ; and Marischal college, instituted and en dowed by George Keith, Earl Marischal, in 1593. The universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh contain one college each, but embrace all the faculties in their course of instruction. 35. Each of these universities enjoys the privilege of conferring literary honours in all the faculties. The aggregate number of stu dents attending all these seminaries is 2503, of whom about 1050 belong to the University of Edinburgh, 843 to that of Glasgow, and the remainder to Aberdeen and St Andrews. 36. The peers of Scotland, by the Treaty of Union, elect sixteen"], [333, "POPULATION.] STATISTICS. 297 of their number to be their representatives in the House of Lords. These sixteen peers, who are not elected for life, but for the conti nuance of the parliament for which they are chosen, enjoy all the privileges of the peers of England. The other peers of Scotland have all the privileges of the House of Lords, except the legislative and judicial powers, and the privileges thence arising. The number of Scottish peers at the Union was 154 ; but the present number is eighty-one, namely, eight dukes, four marquises, forty-one earls, one countess, five viscounts, twenty-one barons, and one baroness. Forty-one of these are also British peers, and three are likewise peers of Ireland. 37. The number of the Scottish representatives since the pass ing of the reform bill, is fifty-three, thirty being chosen by the counties, whilst the burghs and towns, seventy-six in number, send twenty-three. The counties, thirty-three in number, return only thirty members, because, for parliamentary objects, Kinross and Clackmannan, Elgin and Nairn, and Ross and Cromarty, are re spectively united. The aggregate number of the county constitu encies, in 1852, was 49,962 ; and of the burgh constituencies, 47,423. The total constituency of Scotland is 97,385. 38. The population of Scotland was supposed to be 1,050,000, in the year 1700 ; it was ascertained to be 1,265,380, in 1755 ; about 1798, it appears to have been 1,526,492. In 1841, it was 2,620,184 ; and at the last census in 1851, it amounted to 2,888,742. Great as has been the advance of population since the beginning of the last century, and particularly since 1801, it has been considerably less in proportion than during the same period in England or Ireland. This result seems to have been owing prin cipally to the consolidation of farms in the low country; the ex tinction of the cottier system in the Highlands, and the substitu tion, in its stead, of large sheep farms ; the comparative want of poor laws ; and the obstacles interposed by the law of Scotland to the sub-letting of farms, and to the subdivision of land. But how ever it may be accounted for, the fact is certain, that, as compared with the increase of wealth, the population of Scotland has increas ed less rapidly than that of either of the two sister kingdoms. The Scotch have, therefore, advanced much more rapidly than the Eng lish or Irish in wealth, and in command of the necessaries and con veniences of life. Their progress in this respect has, indeed, been quite astonishing. The habits, diet, dress, and other accomoda tions of the people, have been signally improved. It is not too much to affirm, that the peasantry of the present day are better lodged, better clothed, and better fed, than the middle class of landowners were a century ago."], [334, "[REVENUE, &C 298 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 39. But the great prosperity and advancement which Scotland has undergone, is best proved by the state of her public revenue. The revenue of Scotland at the Union, including taxes then im posed, amounted to L.160,000. In 1851, it had increased to L.6,154,804. The value of real property assessed for the pro perty and income-tax, in 1851, was L.10,720, 002, and the total property assessed was L.26, 980,267. 40. The commerce of Scotland was of little importance until after the Union in 1707, when the American and West Indian trade was first engaged in. The first ship belonging to Scotch owners was built on the Clyde in 1718, for the American trade. Since then, the mercantile marine has grown with the prosperity of Glasgow, with which town it is principally connected. The principal exports consist of cotton and linen stuffs, and yarn, wool, iron, hardware, silk goods, coal, spirits and beer, black cattle, herrings, salmon, &c. The principal imports are tea, sugar, coffee, raw cotton, flax, hemp, tobacco, raw silk, wine, dye stuffs, &c. In 1851, the nett amount of the customs revenue of Scotland was L.I, 944, 554 sterling. The number of ships built was 138, with a tonnage of 38,858 ; but the total tonnage of ships registered in the same year was 536,266, employing 29,587 hands. The principal seaports in Scotland are Glasgow, Greenock, Leith, Dundee, Aberdeen, and Port-Glasgow. The first boat successfully impelled by steam in Europe was the Comet, which began to ply on the Clyde in 1812, and was the result of the skill and in genuity of the late Henry Bell. For two years afterwards, there was not more than one steam-boat in Scotland. In 1851, the number had increased to 178. 41. The linen manufacture was the earliest, and long regarded as the staple, branch of industry carried on in Scotland. But such were the narrow limits within which it was confined, that, at the Union, in 1707, it was not supposed to exceed 1,500,000 yards a-year. In 1845, the imports of flax and hemp amounted to 40,000 tons, which were spun by the mills in Dundee and its vicinity. In 1847, the value of manufactured linen and yarn exported from Dundee was from L.I, 600, 000 to L.I, 700, 000 a-year. Dundee, and the east of Scotland, including Fifeshire, are the great seats of the manufacture, particularly in sheetings, Osnaburgs, sail-cloth, and the coarser fabrics ; and Dunfermline, with the neighbouring towns and villages, the principal seat of damask, diaper, and the finer fabrics. The number of flax factories in 1850 was 189, em ploying 28,312 hands. 42. Lanarkshire, which includes the city of Glasgow, and also the contiguous county of Renfrew, are the principal seats of the"], [335, "MANUFACTURES.] STATISTICS. 299 cotton manufacture. Some of the fabrics made at Glasgow and Paisley are of almost unrivalled beauty and fineness. The first steam-engine for the spinning of cotton erected in Scotland, was constructed so late as 1792. In 1850, the number of cotton factories was 168, with 1,683,093 spindles, 23,564 power looms, employing 36,325 hands, and producing from four to five millions sterling per annum. 43. The woollen manufacture of Scotland has never been consi derable. It was formerly the custom for the occupiers of land in this country, to spin the whole of their wool with the hand in their own houses, and to send the yarn to the village weaver to be woven into a species of coarse cloth called plaiding; but this mode, which is indicative of a rude and backward state of society, is now en tirely abandoned, excepting in some parts of the Highlands, having been superseded by machinery. Factories for the making of fine cloth have been established in Aberdeenshire, and in some other counties ; but comparatively coarse fabrics still continue to be the staple article of Scotch manufacture. The num ber of woollen and worsted factories in 1850was 188, with 233,533 spindles, 247 power looms, and employing 10,210 hands. Theseare situated chiefly at Aberdeen, Hawick, Galashiels, and Jedburgh, and in the counties of Stirling, Clackmannan, Argyle, and Inverness. Ha wick has almost entirely withdrawn from this species of manufacture, and devotes its energies principally to the production of woollen hose, of which it annually produces about 500,000 pairs, with blankets and flannels. The towns of Stirling and Bannockburn are almost the exclusive seats of tartans. Kilmarnock is chiefly celebrated for its manufacture of carpets and shawls, besides large numbers of nightcaps, bonnets, and foraging caps for the army. Bonnets, in Scotland, however, have been pretty generally superseded by hats. 44. The silk manufacture in Scotland is still less considerable than that of woollen. The principal seats of it are at Paisley, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. Broad silks, or manufactured goods of entire silk, sold by the yard, viz. gauzes, Persians, satins, and, in general, all broad silks, plain or figured, are made at these places, particularly the two first. The number of silk mills, in 1850, was five, in which were employed 841 persons. 45. Soap has long been manufactured to a very great extent in Scotland ; and the principal seats of the manufacture are Glasgow, Greenock, Leith, Paisley, Aberdeen, Prestonpans, Montrose, and Linlithgow. 46. Scotland has long been famous for its fisheries. Its salmon fishery is very considerable. The total value of the salmon caught in Scotland has been estimated at L.150,000 a-year. The herring"], [336, "300 [BANKS. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. fishery has long been extensively cultivated, and much capital has been in- vested in it. The chief seat is the east of Scotland, of which Wick, and its suburb, Pultneytown, in Caithness, are important stations. 594,031 barrels of herring were cured daring the year 1851. In addition to the herring, the Scottish coast abounds with various kinds of white fish, such as haddock, cod, ling, and the like, as also oysters, flounders, and other flat fish. In 1851, the total number of persons employed in the herring, cod, and ling fisheries, amounted to 70,906. 47. This account of Scottish institutions would not be complete if it did not refer, however briefly, to the system of banking for which Scotland has become so celebrated. The Scottish banks are joint-stock establishments with large constituencies ; and, except in the case of chartered banks, each partner is responsible to the extent of his private fortune. With the char- tered banks the responsibility is limited ; but then the charter guarantees a certain amount of capital. These establishments, consisting of extensive constituencies, whose responsibility is unlimited, or, if chartered, possessing large capitals paid up or guaranteed, enjoy the perfect confidence of the public Besides, they are severally under the management of a body of directors chosen by the partners out of their own body, and directly and periodically responsible to their constituents ; and under their superinten- dence, the banking business is carried on in these establishments on the most judicious and improved principles. The different banks also periodi- cally exchange notes with each other ; in Edinburgh, twice weekly, and in the country generally once a week ; and if any one bank has, after an ex- change is made, an overplus of the notes of any other, this latter must re- deem these notes, either by a payment in specie, or in exchequer bills, or Bank of England notes. The over-issuing of notes is prevented by an act of parliament passed in 1845, which gives the privilege of issuing paper money only to the banks which were previously in existence ; and further limits the amount of the issues of each of these banks to the average of the year preceding the passing of the act. Weekly and monthly returns are made of such issue, as well as of the specie on hand ; and if any monthly average of the notes exceed in circulation the amount allowed by the first monthly average, a sum equal to the excess of such issue is forfeited to the Crown. The Scotch banks receive sums as low as L.10, or sometimes lower, as deposits ; and allow interest on them at about one or one-and-a- half per cent, below the market rate. The system of \" cash accounts\" is peculiar to the Scottish mode of banking. A cash account is a credit given by a bank to .an individual with two or more collateral securities, for a cer- tain sum which he may draw out wholly or partially, as he pleases, replac- ing it in the same way, being charged interest only on the portion he with- draws. The act prohibiting the circulation of small notes in England did not extend to Scotland ; so that the currency consists almost exclusively of paper, namely, notes of the value ofL.l and upwards. The Scotch banks draw on London at twenty days' date. The Bank of Scotland, the oldest banking establishment in Scotland, was established in 1695, and issued notes for L.I as early as 1704. The Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727 ; and the British Linen Company in 1746."], [337, ""], [338, "insteume: BISHOPS BRANKS. The iron frame surrounds the head, while a piect the mouth.
