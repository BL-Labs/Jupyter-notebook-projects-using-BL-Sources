On account of Karl Troika's unfortunate leap, he had been compelled, through Louis Lesley, to apply for leave of absence for a month, ably supplying a substitute, in the person of an <ex-officio officer's son. Therefore, Karl felt no pangs of a lost secretaryship, to retard his recovery. But the leisure that was beneficial to him, Avas almost prejudicial to Louis, who never considering the future, was quite content to AAaste Alice Warden's time, and to teach her to believe in words only, spoken lightly, and for VOL.

Many a time the housemaid had to undergo a severe rebuke from one or other of the servants, and the strain AA-as ever the same : \" Idling again ; I only Avish Aliss Lesley Averen't glued to the sick room, and then she'd settle Alaster Louis' nonsense.

AA'e'll see Avho's in the right Avhen Aliss Bertha catches you. And when tlie substance of cook's remark* reached Louis, the latter told Alice not to mind cook's jealousy. He Avould sIioav her who Avas master, even if his sister dared to interfere. And so matters Avent on, Avithout attracting any notice from either the Rector, or Bertha ; for the former's study looked out on the drive, and it"], [15, "FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER. 3 Avas here he generally spent four hours of the day, and afterwards he Avas riding or visiting ; Bertha, when she chanced to come down to the morning room for half-an-hour or so, often saAv her brother lolling in his hammock, while the housemaid seemed arranging a glass and bottle ona tray, preparatory, as Bertha thought, to bring ing them in doors, never dreaming, that but for her oaatl advent in the morning room, Alice would have been seated on the grass reading, or in the act of lighting Louis a fresh cigarette. Thus, Louis Lesley's course of love-making to a simple and pretty country girl, ran its smooth AA'ay, till, one hot day, towards the end of August, Avhen it Avas too broiling even to remain out of doors, Louis, having come in from the Hall, tired with lawn tennis, chanced to find Alice standing in the dining room, arranging some floAvers for the table. On his entrance, the girl looked up with a pleased smile, and Louis Avent up to the side-board, saying : B\u2014 2"], [16, "4 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? \" AA'ell, duck, the roses don't come up to your cheeks in their deep beauty.\" And he gave the girl a kiss to make those cheeks even a darker carnation than at present, But, evidently, it Avas not the first time, for Alice plucked a moss rose from the bunch, and began sticking it in her admirer's loose white and blue tennis suit. Then, remembering that dinner would be in an hour or so, the girl added : \" But you Avill want it in your evening coat ; so I Avon't pin it in.\" \" Yes ; but I'm not going to take off these togs yet a bit. It's too hot except for a lounge ; and, as you're here, Ave'll finish that Irish fellow O'AIalley.\" And the girl having fetched the book from their usual rendezvous hammock, Louis added : \" You settle yourself in my Ioav smokin<r chair, and I'll lie on the floor \u2014 the coolest place, by Jove ! this hot Aveather.\" And, suiting the action to the Avords, the"], [17, "\u20223 FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER. young man stretched himself at full length, with his head leaning against Alice's knee, and now and again pulling her up for a Avrongly pronounced word, or explanation of what the feiloAv meant \u2014 a sufficiently interesting interrup tion to keep Louis amused. It was in this position and thus employed that the Rector came upon them. In an instant Louis caught the danger of such a discovery ; and, snatching the book, scrambled on his knees, and began to tear out the advertisement sheets at the end, while he gave half-Avhispered commands to Alice. \" Sit still. Say the things Avouldn't light anything. Then he said aloud, \" I declare the AA'ood must be damp.\" Whether the housemaid guessed Louis' ruse, or thought his sanity had forsaken him, I cannot say, but the girl looked thoroughly dumbfounded as her master Avalked up to AA'here she sat, asking, in a stern voice :"], [18, "6 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? \" AA'hat are you doing here ? This is no place for my servants to be sitting ! \" Alice had risen from the chair, but could think of no answer in which Louis Avould be blameless ; and, meanwhile, the young man turned round to explain. \" The girl sat down by my orders, Avhile I tried to light this fire, which insists on going out. And noAv all the matches are spent, so it had better be given up as a bad job. You can go, Alice.\" \" No ; remain AA'here you are, girl. I should certainly think you'd better give up any idea of a fire. Perhaps you're not aAvare that the thermometer is at 84\u00b0 in the shade ; and, as for fire, there's none laid, as far as I can see ; only a shimmery lot of summer shavings.\" And Louis had the mortification of knowing that his cat's paw Avas a bubble. He ever thought that a good substantial fire remained laid behind those gaudy baubles of the"], [19, "7 FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER. summer stove decoration, but from this day he AA'as undeceived, and ever mistrusted an ornate fire grate. \" Yes ; but who was to know that ? \" he roughly ansAvered ; \" and, as to heat, a fellow may catch a chill at tennis, even in India, and I ordered a fire on coming from the hall.\" \" Indeed ! and the servant girl sits in the easy chair, by way of lighting it ? Now you can leave the room Alice, and remain in the kitchen until I ring \" Avas the Rector's reply. But though the maid had stood silent all tlie time, tliere Avas a chance of a way of escape. Noav that she felt sure the Rector had seen them ere they expected, and that he Avas about to take Louis to task \u2014 Alice began to own all as her fault. \" Yes, sir ; but please don't think it Avas the young gentleman's fault. He rang the bell, and I was going to take the shavings out, when I"], [20, "8 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? felt all of a dizziness, and Mister Louis, Avho Avas reading, didn't knoAV but Avhat the fire Avas all right for lighting; and, as I couldn't speak, it \" Hoav many thousand lies Alice Warden would have invented the devil only knows, had not the Rector broke in upon them with : \" That aaHI do ; and I am glad you've so far recovered that you can leave the room when told to.\" So the poor girl had to go, leaving Louis, for once in his life, to brave it out alone. Directly the door closed the father turned on his son Avith the angry words : \" You lie ! you know you Avere spraAvling at that girl's feet, listening to her reading \u2014 aud you are coward enough to give me a pack of lies.\" All Louis' prudence Avas forgotten in the unexpectedness of the attack, and his sense of manliness deeply Avounded."], [21, "FROM ONE KXTRKMi: To ANOTHER. 9 \" And if I Avas, AA'hose right is it to prevent me? If I care to make love to a dozen such girls, it's my concern, not your's, or my sister's either, so far as that goes.\" \" Indeed ! AA'ell, you own to being equaUy as unscrupulous as regards truth as the poor deluded servant wench Avhom you suppose you honour with your attentions. But so long as she's under my roof I've a right to protect her; and, there fore, I AA'ill ask you a Aery plain question \u2014 when is this love making to cease, and Alice Warden to become your Avife ?\" \" AIv wife ! \" exclaimed Louis, enraged, \" AA hy you must have a mean idea of your son to think that he looks no higher than one of your kitchen maids. I ha\\e no intention oi ever making this girl mv AA'ife ; and, in fact, I have no thought of marrying at all at present.\" \" Oh ! that's it. AA'ell, then, I give you one AA'eek to reconsider your former conduct, or to change your decision, and then I will let you"], [22, "10 DOCTOR, OR LOVER? know my resolve. Meanwhile, I consider it only just to Alice Warden, for me to inform her of your heartless intentions ; for I saAv you before entering the house, and was near enough to the open window to hear your remarks, and to see what foolish trust the girl places in them. Noav you can go, and I Avill see the servant.\" \" As you please ; but in any case, I suppose, you don't mean to make this a public matter. For instance, my sister need not be bothered about it,\" Louis added. \" Certainly not ; I consider myself bound to secrecy for one Aveek, AA'hen you will either sIioav by your conduct that you have learnt to dis tinguish betAveen the culture and bringing up of a servant to those in an equal station of life to your oavii ; or you will have the proper spirit and generosity of an upright man to entertain an honourable love for this girl ; and iioav I have nothing more to say till I see AA'hat your behaviour is.\""], [23, "11 FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER. And the Rector's hand touched the bell, AA'hich had hardly given over vibrating, when Alice Warden entered the room ; and Louis, see ing his father was determined, made a hasty retreat. Her master opened the conversation by telling the girl Iioav grieved he Avas at her many falsehoods ; but, as he believed she did it to screen his son he would not try her more by showing Iioav Avrong in every case it was to lie. Then the Rector asked her to ansAver truthfully, and Avithout fear of any consequences, a feAV questions he Avished to put to her. They Avere as follows : and the ansAvers were given in a voice half choked with tears. \" Hoav long is it since my son chose you as a companion ?\" \" About a month back, sir ; one day when I Avas cleaning the windoAV in \" \"That will do; I only wanted to know how long ago. Noav, has there been any talk of"], [24, "12 DOCTOR, OR LOVER? love ? Has Alaster Louis at any time told you he loves you ?\" \" Yes. \" Hoav many times has he said so ? \" To this the girl ga\\re no ansAver, but AA'hen her interlocutor added : \" I suppose he frequently told you so ? \" She gave an affirmative. \" Do vou love him as you might any other young man more of your oaa'ii class ? \" \" Oil ves ! much more.\" \" Then, of course, you expect him to fix some time Avhen you may be married ? Has my son ever said anything to you about that ? \" \" Only that he would fix some time before he had to leave home again.\" \" And you are in the habit of kissing each other and amusing yourselves as lovers ? \" The girl's face Avas on fire, and the Rector saAv that even such a mild spirit as Alice AA'arden's might be roused too much, so he"], [25, "13 FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER. awaited not an answer, but went on explaining Avhat he had told his son \u2014 that he had given Alaster Louis a week to make up his mind, and that during that time he only asked her to keep as much out of his son's Avay as possible, and neA'er to wait on him, or be AA'ith him unless he sought her out ; for, although Louis' father, he, however hard, should then feel bound to take her part against his son, and it Avould only be by her OAA'n foolishness that she Avould forfeit his protection. The girl's self pride was roused, as the Rector intended ; and, although she declared that she Avanted no one to protect her, or take her part against anyone, still she resolved to let her lover see that she had her pride, and if she Avas worthy his former petting, he must not mind his father's sternness, but take her part himself. But Louis Lesley AA'as the last person to let prudence be the better part of valour, and AA'hen Alice, looking as if she had cried her eyes out,"], [26, "14 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? met him the next morning, Louis became as foolishly enamoured as ever, and would give the girl no peace until she had promised to meet him in Slade lane the following evening. \" The guv'nor shall have no chance of tyrannizing over us ; and to prevent you getting into any more scrapes, I'll go off to Dorster for the day, and meet you at seven, coming by road, instead of waiting for the nine train. Noav, does that prove my love, or not ? \" And Louis looked quite as if the proof AA'as too strong to be for one moment contested. So nothing of an excitable or more engrossing character having taken place, this lover of idleness kept his troth and spent the twilight and first hour of a new moon in whispering endearments to this pretty, credulous housemaid. But lonely as a country road is after the time Avhen \" The weary ploughman homeAvard plods his Avay,\" still the Rector's son had forgotten that the eyes of Arius are the heirloom of all"], [27, "15 FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER. villages ; and Avhereas your most intimate friend may pass you. linked arm in arm Avith the prettiest Venus in the Strand, a perfect stranger Avill not pass you in the country without an enquiry as to \" AA'ho's who ? \" and is sure to establish your identity Avith out fail before he has done with the village gossips. On this same evening Dr. Aloore and his ci devant partner bowled past these two love makers at so quick a pace that Louis, used to toAA'ns, Avith their constant traffic, entirely failed to recognize the doctor, although he cursorily said to Alice : \" That felloAv knows these parts, or he Avouldn't go that pace in these serpent-like lanes \" \u2014 and never waited to hear AA-hether his companion knew who they AA'ere or not. It Avas just the opposite with the drivers ; for Doctor Aloore's eyes Avere still worthy of the lynx tribe, and Louis's well-shaped figure, outlined by the"], [28, "16 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? brightness of the lunar orb, could not be mistaken for some amorous Hodge. So, although not recognising exactly the individual, he turned to Lee AA'est AA'ith the question : \" None of our folks are they ? And yet I seem to knoAv the young man ! \" \" It's Louis Lesley, but I don't know AA'ho his companion is,\" Avas Lee's answer. \" Dear me ! then no doubt it's our patient's sister ; and, finding in what good hands Air. Troika is, she's not averse to a stroll AA'ith Alaster Louis.\" \" Hardly, I think ; because I understood at the time of Air. Troika's accident, that he had no near relations.\" \" Indeed ! AA'ell, no doubt we shall find Aliss Lesley in, and then Ave shall hear,\" suggested Dr. Moore. \" Yes, but should the Rector not be in, there's little use in my stopping, so I'll leave the trap and Avalk home, if you don't mind,\" and the"], [29, "FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER. 17 younger man's voice sounded tired and put out, causing his companion to acquiesce. \" As you like, but since you're back in Slade again, no doubt he'd prefer seeing you. I only took your charge in hand a\\ Lile you were absent.\" \" Not at all. Aliss Lesley sent for me because while lock-jaAv Avas imminent, frequent visits were necessary ; but noAv I've missed a day betAveen as a rule,\" explained Lee. \" Rubbish, my dear felloAv ! They sent for you because you are prompt and clever in extreme cases, and I am vacillating. I mean to show Lesley that AA'e doctors are less captious than the cloth, by paying him a visit, AA'hile you see the patient.\" And the old man had his Avay, for the Rector came out to greet them as the dog cart dreAv up, and both got down and entered the Rectory, their host saying : \" Pleased to see AArest back. Tavo good VOL. II. C"], [30, "18 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? things at once. I'm glad to say our patient improves, and AA'hen all our medical staff appear on the scene it's time he took up his bed and Avalked ; eh ? \" \" Yes, yes ; but I hope things aren't pro gressing too fast. The early bud gets nipped the hardest, and Air. Troika must take care,\" Dr. Aloore replied. \" Quite so. AA'ell, when you say he's fit to go I shan't hinder him ; but he's AA'elcome to stay till then.\" \" Then we mustn't ask you to judge when our patient's whole. Perhaps Aliss Lesley Avould be the most impartial judge,\" and Dr. Aloore made a courteous boAv to Bertha, who had caught the two last sentences as she came doAvn stairs. AA'est looked round, for he had been placing his gloves in his hat on the stand, and he saAv a flush rise to the young girl's cheek at the last remark ; so, turning to the group near"], [31, "19 FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER. the Library door, Lee took upon himself to ansAver : \" I think Ave doctors should act Avithout appeal, not even consulting the host for the time being ; don't you, sir ? \" and AA'est turned to the Rector. \" Yes ; do AA'hat you like, AA'est, but don't leave me to cheer such a revolutionary creature as this Troika into health.\" And not AA'ishing, for Bertha's sake, to prolong the conversation, the young doctor began to mount the stairs, first asking Aliss Lesley to precede him. \" I shall join you in the smoking-room then, if you are not coming up,\" he added. \"Yes, do,\" shouted Air. Lesley, and the tAvo elder gentlemen entered the room referred to by AA'est, the Rector remarking : \" By the bye, Moore, you must have met the train my son comes by, if he hasn't Avalked.\" \" No ; but avc met your son in Slade Lane, c\u2014 2"], [32, "20 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? walking Avith some lady ; so he must have come by an earlier train from Dorster.\" \" AVhatever took him such a roundabout Avay. I suppose his companion AA'as one of those walking bipeds \u2014 a Aliss Price ? \" \" No, it Avas no one I kneAv, but perhaps AA'est can tell you,\" ansAvered the old doctor. And so the subject dropped until that young man joined them."], [33, "21 DECEIVED EVERYWHERE. CHAPTER II. DECEIVED EA'ERYWHERE. AA'hen Lee entered the sick-room he had to undergo the torture of finding the patient lying back on a comfortable lounge sofa, covered with light Avoollen rugs, such as proclaim their oAvner and maker to be of the fair sex, and a book of poems on a small table close to the invalid lying open before a Aacant seat, no doubt deserted by Bertha. Karl Troika Avas decidedly stronger since the doctor last saAv him, and AA'hen Aliss Lesley left them alone Karl pressed to knoAv Avhat Avas the earliest date he could safely return to London. \" You see, doctor, I stand the chance of losing my appointment at the Embassy.

I so seldom bore him, and he can't come up here very often, and yet I shouldn't like them to think me ungrateful for all the kindness, and run off the minute I Avas out of the Avood ; and a doctor's word of discharge from the sick list is quite another thing.\" \" There is no chance of you appearing ungrateful AA'ith regard to Aliss Lesley ; and the Rector Avould take it more gracefully as coming from his daughter than myself, I fancy, Air.

AA'e could do very well Avithout his per- mission.\" Lee felt angry that he had given this man au opportunity of using endearing epithets of the girl he himself had loved all too well, and he would have liked to have expressed his scorn in more than mere words ; but he only said, as his moustached upper li]) gave a proud curl : \" You, as a man, can afford to dispense Avith a parent's permission ; but a woman can never disobey her laAvful protector ; and if she does the one to induce such a step can only compensate by a life of unselfish forethought on her behalf. Certainly you must know in your own case, Air. Troika, there is more shame and suffering for the AA-eaker one AA'here secrecy is imposed.\" \" You think so,\" was Karl's cynical reply. \" I suppose you've studied women, as Avell as physics. AVell, I find a woman never loves better"], [36, "24 DOCTOR, OR LOVER? than to be shrouded in deceit and mystery ; so you see experience differs.\" \" As my remark Avas not from experience, of course you . have the strongest claim ; but a Avoman, such as I apply that word to, Avould hardly feel your AA'ords apply to her,\" was the doctor's angry retort. \" Perhaps not ; but Ave have gone entirely a-field. Then you'll strike me off your sick list seven day's hence ? And, meanAvhile, I must move about a bit more, and go out to get hardened.\" And, after giving a feAV directions, Lee AArest joined the Rector and his partner, throAving out a hint on Air. Troika's behalf as to his leaving Slade that day Aveek ; and it Avas only as the two medical men Avere about to leave that the subject of Louis' return came up again, but Lee AA'est could only corroborate Dr. Aloore's information, adding : \" I thought it might be some friend of Aliss Lesley's.\""], [37, "25 DECEIVED EVERYWHERE. And so the subject apparently died a natural death. But, when the visitors had gone, the Rector went towards the drawing room, and, not finding his daughter there, he rang the bell, directing the butler to find Miss Lesley. Bertha came into the room, prepared to hear the doctor's opinion of the invalid's progress, all of which she ahvays managed to possess herself of first hand, but which she had to pretend Avas a matter of great enlightenment, but, otherwise of pure indifference. Noav, the Rector's mind Avas occupied with his son's conduct, and he informed Bertha of his surprise a feAV day's back, in find ing Louis and the housemaid on such terms of intimacy, and of his promise to his son not to take further steps in the matter till he saAv Avhether it Avas through his thoughtless encouragement that Alice had so fir forgotten her station and duty. \" And yet, Bertha, only two days haAe gone, and Louis has planned this meeting with the"], [38, "26 DOCTOR, OR LOVER? girl ; for that it's the housemaid, and no other, that Dr. Aloore saAv strolling in Slade Lane, I am convinced ; and, I sent for you, because, of course, as mistress, it is easier for you to find out whether the girl is in the house or not, and, Avhen I know, matters shall entirely be taken into my hands, for your brother shall neither act this deceit under my roof or destroy the maid's character for his amusement.\" \" Oh ! papa, don't act rashly ; it is only because Louis has nothing better to do, for he can't for a moment love this servant girl,\" Bertha asserted. \" AA'ell, then, he shouldn't act the lover. No ; I'll make him come to his senses, or he shall marry her before leaving home, AvhateA'er people may say as to his station \u2014 they shall never accuse me of false, hollow pride, Avhen justness to the least of my people is denied them.\" \" But, surely, you're not going to insist on Louis marrying the girl ?\" exclaimed Bertha."], [39, "27 DECEIVED EVERYWHERE. \" Yes, I am ; if I find he has broken his word to me, and gone out purposely to meet this Alice AA'arden, then, I think, he either really loves her, or, if not, no sternness can be too harsh for his conduct.\" \" Don't ! don't ! be so cruel, father ; what could be harder than to be bound for life to one born and bred with alien sentiments.

Her father's implicit trust in her, Avhen all the time she Avas hiding the most important step in her Avhole life from him, galled the girl to the quick, and she gave vent to her impatience and Avrath at her OAvn deceitfulness. \" AA'hy do I care Avhether he thinks me so immaculate or not ?

Avhich ever since Karl Troika's accident had been her frequent resort.

No fear of that, Bertha. Why here I've sat day after day, and, except for"], [44, "32 DOCTOR, OR LOVER? a politely cool message as to my progress, your father has never been near me. So you see there is very little chance of success. Besides, one day Avhen AA'e Avere together I Avent so far as a man can Avithout definitely asking for his daughter, and Air.

And Karl continued : \" No ; I only leaA-e you noAV to make my foot ing secure, and, Avhen I return, to take you nolens volens ; and you shall never run the risk of losing property that Avould rightly belong to"], [45, "DECEIVED EVERYWHERE. 33 you by incurring your father's displeasure for my sake.\" And the girl felt very happy to possess such unselfish love. Did she \u2014 does any girl really knoAv when that treasure Avithout price is really her's ? Not certainly AA-hen she has abandoned her whole heart to her lover. Then, it is only the indifferent onlooker avIio is a just critic.

Lesley, senior, on leaving Karl's room, changed his open, clerical coat for a tight riding jacket, AA'hich he scrupulously buttoned up to the chin, as if to exclude a biting east wind ; then slipping into a pair of old doAAn-trodden slippers the Rector made his Avay silently down stairs, into the dark draAving room, closing the door silently after him. It must have been quite tAventy minutes siuce the clock struck ten, Avhen the sharp ears of the listening father caught Louis' A-oice, saying : \" Good-night, that's all I Avant ; but you may as AA'ell tell the housemaid that my sister's Avork"], [52, "40 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? is to go to her room \u2014 it is on the chiffoniere in the morning room.\" \"Yes, sir.

So time waxed old, and except for some boastful words on Louis' part, about hoodwinking the governor, nothing definite was said, until Alice looked up at the clock, and seeing the late hour, exclaimed : \" How I shall miss you ! I hardly know how I shall hve on here, when you go, Louis. How good you are to me ; but I can never write to you as another could, because of being in a place.\" \"No ; but I can get you asked up to my land lady's.

AA'hen the Rector had given the girl time to steal softly up tlie back stairs, he \u2014 with the greatest sang froid \u2014 began drawing one of the curtains aside, causing his son, who had resumed his seat on the sofa\u2014 to look up, as if some injured spirit had appeared. The Rector's greeting was : \" Don't alarm yourself, I am your father, although I blush to confess it. Yes, sir ! I have used your own blunt tools of lying and deceit ; and, instead of going to bed, I sat up, and came in here \u2014 not before it was necessary. No, not a word,\" for Louis was attempting to speak now he was convinced of the materialism of the apparition. \" No, not a word, sir !

All blame was placed on Alice Warden, and if it had not been for the Rector's stern refusal to dismiss the girl, Bertha would have sent the housemaid from the house,. although Louis certainly was the chief delinquent, and fully deserved his father's harsh decree. A few tears, and Bertha realized that her brother's departure was but the herald of a few days to her lover's second parting. But Karl's leave taking was less painful on that very account, as Bertha knew that in losing him her brother was the gainer, for Louis' last good bye had brought her mother's entreaty before her, and the girl,"], [60, "48 DOCTOR, OR LOVER \"? in spite of her usually indulgent parent's command, had prayed for Louis' forgiveness \u2014 but in vain ; and for the first time, a cold spirit of opposition had prevented father and daughter seeking one another's society. So Karl Troika left behind him hopes of a happy future, and present protection, to a foolish but much loved brother ; and a fortnight after, Bertha was con tent to feel that Karl's presence was keeping Louis from a too reckless course, or at least checking it, although the words of her lover's letter made her ponder anxiously as she read the following sentences : \" Louis is so fond of late hours that I seldom see him at the ' Crito,' and not much at my rooms ; but he wants an advance of his coming interest. As you know, I am ever Avilling to help one Avho is so dear to my beloved one \u2014 only mentioning all \u2014 because it is hard to keep one single thought or plan from my Bertha ;\" Avords that called up a blush of love"], [61, "49 BLUNT TOOLS. on the girlish cheek as she kissed the writing.

So she AATote, Avithout seeking any advice, telling Karl to advance no more, and that her share of interest should be applied by Avay of repayment of that already lent ; but on no account Avas Louis to knoAv this. AA'ell might she sigh to think Avhen the time would come that she should feel happy and free as before love entered into her life ; and Karl Troika, Avhile teaching her the superb existence of \" a spark of the divine soul,\" had also made her realise the adage that runs : \" Love perverts Justice.\" It Avas the VOL. n. E"], [62, "50 DOCTOR, OR LOVER 1 harvest of Nature ; but Avhat Avould that harvest be if present anxiety, present disappointment could reap a complete happiness ! Surely Bertha Lesley's future joy Avas secure ; but secrecy and subsequent subterfuge had entered largely into that ruby cup, and might not the dregs diffuse themselves through the Avhole clearness of the wine of a life-long loA-e. September had shed a gloAv of fading summer o'er the recently cut corn fields ; and Nature haA'ing fulfilled all her promises, seemed to be at rest, basking in the year's aftermath. So, on this afternoon, Avere the thoughts of a certain rider \u2014 in a state of longing regret for glories past. As Lee AVest Avas returning from a long ride, after a visit to an outlying patient, he alloAved his horse to sink into the country parson's jog trot, Avhile his thoughts fled from connection Avith present action ; influenced, no doubt, by the scene around. The bare stubble, looking like numberless"], [63, "51 BLUNT TOOLS. bayonettes in the beams ofthe sun, and, on either side hedges uncut for years, growing in wild luxuriance, the still graceful dog-rose peeping out and trailing along the irregular bank of leaves, and the ever present spirit of the wayside life, the dead gold sheen of the heath and meadoAV, butterflies flitting ever on their devious course. Lee AA'est's face looked calm, even as the summer clouds above, aud yet a sigh parted those lips, generally so firmly closed \u2014 an audible response to the sigher's thoughts ; and Lee dreAv the reins up as if to banish the mood by action, AA'hen his hand Avas stayed by the sight of a lady equestrian, avIio, apparently, had been rambling idly as he had himself. A turn in the lane brought Bertha Lesley into vieAvr and also made her mare prick up its ears at the sound of advancing hoofs, and, with a glance backwards, the girl set her steed at a brisk trot, no doubt recognising and AA'ishing to avoid a E\u2014 2"], [64, "52 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? meeting with the young doctor. But Lee's horse, stirred by a spirit of emulation, as most well bred steeds are at the sound of a comrade's brisk trot, set off at a good pace, AA'hich his master evidently had no desire to check, and, although a good space lay between the riders, it Avould but have been a minutes work to over take Aliss Lesley. For fully five minutes matters remained thus, Avhen a gate, thrown carelessly back by a herdsman, caused Bertha's mare to prick up her ears in fright, and caper a bit \u2014 a mere frolic to one accustomed to ridino:, and Lee, Avho kneAv Aliss Lesley's horsemanship to be of no mean calibre, expected to see horse and rider move forAvard, perhaps at a brisker trot, caused by a firm hold on the reins. But no such thing ; the mare AA'as decidedly the master, and backed considerably, making those A'iolent plunges which are as trying to a good rider as they are to shafts and harness, and"], [65, "BLUNT TOOLS. 53 which, in any case but that of an accustomed rider, prove fatal to one's seat. Lee spurred forward, and had drawn Bertha Leslev's reins up Avith a firm grip before either horse or rider had time to rebel. At once the mare obeyed \u2014 feeling correction's sharp prick \u2014 and, after a feAv minutes, took to its usual steady pace, for no vice ran in its finely shaped limbs. \" Thank you, I have never found Rore too strong for me ; but she feels my hand is Aveaker I suppose, for she tosses her head in defiance Avhen I pull her up.

No; the colours still dyed Bertha's cheeks, the fair hair waved back from her open brow, but there Avas a restless, unsatisfied gaze in the girlish eyes, and every feature seemed more acutely draAA-n out ; and, guessing the cause, Lee took up the thread of Bertha's sentence \u2014 \" Yes, in that respect animals are more observant than man, especially horses ; but you must not allow your Aveakness to master you, Miss Lesley, even if you do your horse.\" \" Did I OAA'n to any Aveakness ?

Before the end of the same week that the Doctor had again bound himself to secrecy, Louis Lesley wrote a remarkable epistle to Bertha. Seldom were Louis' letters more than the prescribed sheet, and when his sister found on opening the letter that treble that number comprised its contents, her heart leapt at the thought \u2014 perhaps Karl had enclosed some words, having confided at last in her brother. But this"], [73, "61 THE LION UNMASKED. hope was destroyed by the first feAV words, which ran : \" You AA'ill be startled at the length of my letter, but I have taken the opportunity of Karl Troika's absence in Russia, to inform you of some disagreeable truths.\" Bertha read so far at the breakfast table ; but then, fearing her father's questions, put the envelope and its contents in her pocket, eager to get to the morning room, where she coidd read these truths \u2014 her every feature unmarked. Tavo hours had passed, and still Bertha held this letter in her hand, re-reading it for the third time. Louis began by saying that he had for some time been short of funds, and on one occasion Karl had paid his debts and given him driblets of money to go on with ; but, feeling sure that the interest on their joint capital AA-as larger than the sums doled out to him, he himself applied to the stock-broker, and learnt that the name of Lesley Avas not on the list, nor had any transfer of stock ever passed"], [74, "62 DOCTOR, OR LOVER? through their hands. FolloAving matters up he found that the principal had been paid out of the Pour per cents., unconditionally. Louis demanded an explanation from Karl, avIio had insolently told him he Avas too much of a fool to manage AA'hat little he had, and referred him to Bertha. Noav came the most painful part of all to the recipient of the letter. For, having quar relled Avith Karl, Louis threatened to betray the former's secret correspondence AA'ith his sister to their father in these Avords : \" Troika pretends there is nothing on betAveen you, and it's a blessed thing for you if it's not a lie on his part, for I knoAv iioav AA'hat kind of a felloAv this man is \u2014 a deceitful, ambitious cheat, of the loAvest type, such as is unfit to enter any respectable household.

There are lodgings near mine, quite quiet and respectable, and I Avill see you comfortably settled \u2014 just as Avell not to let the pater knoAV that you're coming to me.\" This letter caused Bertha a Avhole morning's deep thought, but by that time her naturally self reliant spirit had forced on her the tAvo facts \u2014 one that Louis had, through AA'ant of money, picked a quarrel Avith Karl ; secondly, that her lover for the first time AA'as withholding his"], [76, "64 DOCTOR, OR LOVER 1 confidence from her, for her two last letters could never have reached him if he AA'ere in Russia \u2014 an intention of going there never even hinted at in his letter of four days ago. It happened to be a Saturday morning that Louis Lesley's letter reached Slade, and not till noon on Sunday had Bertha decided on her course of action. She would not go to London on the vague chance of her brother finding suitable lodgings, but would join Grace Gorten, who happened to have stayed in toAvn on her Avay back from the seaside ; and Avhile at her friend's she would see Louis. AA'ith regard to Karl, she hardly knew Iioav to act, for not for one moment did Bertha credit Louis' Avilcl statements, but if her lover Avere in Russia, how could she confide her plans to him. At length, Bertha's loving confidence in Karl prevailed, and she AArote telling him that Louis seemed both ill and in Avails, and that she AA'as coming up to Park place, to stay AA'ith Grace Gorten, AA'here she"], [77, "65 THE LION UNMASKED. should hope to see him on AA'ednesday, as Louis by then would have got over his cranky mood, or if not he could come as a friend of the family. Added to this last sentence were the Avords : \" Yes, as a friend, dearest ; hoAV hard it Avill be for me, after so long a parting, but Ave must meet thus before the Avorld till my father knows all.\" The Sunday evening succeeding the arrival of Louis' letter the Rector sent one of the village lads to ask Dr. AA'est to Avait for him after the service. And Colonel Gorten, being absent from the Hall, Lee found himself accepting the first invitation to take supper at the Rectory since August ; for, after his official attendance on Air.

KnoAving the impossibility of Louis coming to Slade, Bertha called to mind an invitation of Grace Gorten's, given ere they left the Hall for Brighton. The invitation Avas to spend a feAV days in toAvn, Avhere Colonel Gorten AA-as breaking the return journey for his invalid daughter's sake, having a toAvn house in Park Place.

To the Rector Bertha made no mention either of Louis' letter or her intention of visitinij the Gorten's, simply Avaiting for Wednesday's post. At breakfast-time that morning Bertha found her expected reply awaiting her, and taking Grace's note eagerly up, just scanned it over, jand then turning to the Rector, said \u2014 \" You AA'ere wishing I could have some change, papa, and here's a letter from Grace Gorten asking me to go up to town for a while before they come back to the Hall. I should like to, very much.\" \" A'ery AA'ell, dear, I certainly think a change will brighten you up, and if you wait till next week I can run up AA'ith you for a day or tAvo.\" \" It's very good of you, but I fear the Gorten's will be having other friends, or coming doAvn here.

I should be back by Tuesday, and perhaps it would be just as Avell Ave should not both go aAA'ay at once.\" \" No, I simply meant it for your pleasure, but Avere you thinking of going at once ?'' \" Yes, to-day ; Grace says anyhow she Avill send the carriage to meet the 4.30 p.m. train at Paddington, on the chance of my coming.\" \" AA'hat a despotic Czarina, noAv or never, eli ? AA'ell, I will see you comfortably off at eleven, if you care to go,'\" answered AIr. Lesley. \" Thanks, father, and mind you take great care of yourself while I'm gone.\" \" And AA'ho must I have to cheer me up of an evening while my Bertha is away. I fear no one but AA'est will take pity on me, Avill they, child ?\" This was malice prepense on the Rector's part, and he Avatched Bertha's face as she answered, \" You knoAv best, but I should sav the order"], [87, "BERTHA TAKES THE REINS. 75 of things should be reversed, and you take pity on him.\" On arriving in town, Bertha Lesley found Colonel Gorten's carriage awaiting her arrival, and Avith the two swift greys in the shafts it took but a short time to reach Park Place. Grace Gorten AAas on her reclining chair, looking even pale for her, although, oAving to a life so exempt from bracing air, her fair cheeks had ever lacked the rough but beautiful tint of Nature's hand. '\" I am delighted you have come, dear Bertha and if I had possessed your brother's address he should have been here to Avelcome you, but papa will ask him to dinner, if you give it us now.\" \" Yes, I will AA'rite my note, and then send it in for you to address and add to, only first you will be glad of a rest,\" suggested Colonel Gorten, as he left them together. And after being conducted to her room by Grace's maid, Bertha joined the latter in her"], [88, "4 6 DOCTOR, OR LOVER I special sanctum, which Avas no doubt originally a breakfast parlour on the first floor. Here Bertha found the Colonel's note, which Avas a cordial invitation to dinner at eight o'clock, and an excuse for the shortness of time owing to a AA-ant of address ; to this Bertha added a feAv lines, telling Louis under any circumstances to come as it Avas quite a social family dinner. Directing it, a footman AAas told to take it to the \" Crito,\" iu Piccadilly, and to see Air.

I Avas thinking, what Rowley always says, how miserable it must be to lounge away one's time at a club,\" Grace explained. \" Yes ; I only AA'ish Louis had something to do. Poor felloAv, he'd be much happier.\" Eight o'clock had struck, and the Colonel and two of his sons \u2014 the eldest just getting out of conceit of his cadetship in the Blues, and RoAAley Gorten, who Avas never happier than when riding with a host of dogs at diis heels \u2014 were talking Avith Bertha, while they aAvaited her brother's tardy appearance, when a note for the Colonel arrived, being a polite excuse from Louis for not accepting his invitation ; and Bertha felt not a little hurt at her brother's apparent hauteur, and apologising for the delav, they Avent into the dining-room. The folloAving morning Bertha received a"], [90, "78 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? letter from Louis Avritten in an evidently far from happy mood. He reproached Bertha for thinking that he had fallen to Tom Hood's level in accepting invitations there was no likelihood of his returning, and AA-ent on to say that if his sister Avished to knoAv more of the facts touched on in his previous letter she had better come to see him, for if she stayed at 'Colonel Gorten's a year he should certainly not come there to be patronised. This decided Bertha to see Louis without the knoAvledge of her friends ; and to this end she enquired of Grace Avhether it AA'ould be convenient for her to do some shopping that morning. Grace at once prof fered the carriage, much to her friend's chagrin ; but seeing the truth of doing as the Romans do, Bertha Lesley drove to Regent Street, comfortably reclining in the Avell-padded barouche, AA'ith no other occupants but the tAvo men-servants on the box-seat. The Colonel ahvays preferred AA'alking to his club, and being"], [91, "79 BERTHA TAKES THE REINS. called for, while Grace never came doAvn until lunch time. An opera louffe on country and toAvn shoppers would, no doubt, amuse the stage patrons ; but it is a curious truth that the former purchasers are less tempted by some novel trifle than the capitalian, simply because the tout ensemble is as alluring as one or two passing whims. It AA'as not long before Bertha had her trophies placed in the carriage, and then addressing the footman as he stood aAvaiting her entry, she told him to call for his master and if the Colonel should enquire for her, to say she Avas taking a cab from Aladame Lese's. Having thus dispensed Avith the accompaniment of Avealth, and feeling sure that a supposed morning call on the fashionable mantua maker Avould calm all anxiety at her non-arrival, even should luncheon-time slip by AA-ithout her re-appearance at Park place, Bertha Avent her way. The first thing Bertha did Avas to hail a cab, and tell the driver to put her doAA'n close to the"], [92, "80 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? \" Crito \" in Piccadilly. Once on the pavement near the club Bertha took out her memorandum book, and wrote on the card above her name the following Avords : \" I find the National Gallery Avill not be open, so, perhaps, you would join me noAv and re-arrange plans.\" Giving this card to the club porter, she asked him to find Air. Louis Lesley if possible, but if that gentleman were not iu the club-room to bring the card back to her. Circumstances favoured the desired interview, for Louis accompanied the messenger, and, greeting his sister, Avent doAvn the steps with her at once, neither speaking until they had got some AA-ay doAAn Piccadilly, and then Louis broke the silence : \" So you thought of going to the National Gallery ; Avell, no place can be better for AA'hat I've got to say, so Ave'll turn that AA'ay.\" \" Yes, if you like, but of course I only put it"], [93, "81 BERTHA TAKES THE REINS. on my card to let you know I AA'as alone,\" ansAA'ered Bertha. \" Quite right. By-the-bye how did you manage to elude the Colonel's flunkies so neatly, for I don't suppose you came here on foot.\" \" No, I droA'e in to shop, and then sent tlie carriage on for Colonel Gorten.\" Conversing by jerks, as one must iu a croAvded and noisy thoroughfare, the sister and brother reached the free art gallery. There among the Avorks of men avIio Avhile sons of genius AA'ere eminently sons of misery and sorroAA', Louis Lesley told Bertha of his quarrel with Karl Troika. As Ave knoAv from Troika's letter, Louis had borroAved from his friend until the latter had refused to lend any more, and to anger Troika, Louis had borroAA'ed from a young man, named Harry Spite, a clerk in Somerset House, and AA'hom he had first met at Troika's, but who had since quarrelled Avith Karl. It Avas vol 11. G"], [94, "82 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? from Spite that Louis first learnt to suspect Karl of not being AA'hat he appeared. \" Harry not only enlarged on a few facts I kneAv already,\" explained Louis to his sister, \" but informed me Troika Avas a political spy, if not worse, and that part of his time AA'as spent in lecturing to a lot of democratic rascals, many of whom were employed in assassination work.\" \" If that is all, I could tell your false friend something more ; for Air. Troika told me long ago that he gave lectures to Avorking men, and I've even read the speeches made by him on these occasions.\" \" Indeed ! weU, I only hope they were corrected editions, for I myself Avent incog, one evening to the door of his place, and the words would hardly stand translating, but perhaps as Troika is so open and above board, you knoAV of a certain dark Italian beauty, and his establish ment in Soho Square ? \" As he put the question, Louis glanced at"], [95, "83 BERTHA TAKES THE REINS. Bertha's face, to see Avhether the full meaning of his AA'ords Avas comprehended by her, but the quick anxious moA-ement of her eyes and the Avan shade that stole over her features, called forth on his part the remark : \" No, of course he hasn't let that out, and it's quite time you kneAv that this Karl Troika is not a gentleman or anything but a rascal, besides being a foreigner and freethinker he's a fast man, and nothing but a heartless scoundrel to entrap you as far as he has to my knoAvledge. I don't suppose you AA-ant me to say anything more I \" \" No, you have accused Karl of acts that I never for a moment think him capable of; but you must prove them first, and then you are quite at liberty to tell my father AA'hat you like.\" \" Yes, but hoAV about our joint alloAvance.

You'd better not say any other visit, because they'll Avant some address. And then come to me. Meanwhile, I'll manage to look up a respectable set of rooms, or, if you like, Ave can go to an hotel if you can afford such an affair.\" \" Yes, that Avould do.

I think I shall prefer leaving the Gortens to suppose I have gone home, and say nothing.\""], [97, "85 BERTHA TAKES THE REINS. \" No ; that Avill spoil it all.

Your cough does not leave you, as it should, and you may as AA-ell take charge of these, as I shan't see you again till AA'ednesday.\" And Bertha passed her purse and a flat gold"], [99, "87 BERTHA TAKES THE REINS. bracelet which usually graced her left wrist into Louis' keeping. It AA-as the thoughtful act of a heart predestined to know sorrow. The sister knew that had she offered her purse alone its slender resources would scarcely be a drop in Louis' exchequer-like expenditure; whereas the solid gold of the ornament would, no doubt find its AA-ay, as Bertha knew her brother's college luxuries had already done, in the realisa tion of so much cash. On her return to Park Place, Bertha Lesley had her Avishes fulfilled. Simply telling Grace Gorten that Tuesday she must prepare to leave them, and bring her pleasant visit to a close. The youthful hostess herself fixed Slade as the bourne to which Bertha Avas about to return, and the last good-bye Avas said Avithout much attempt at deception on Bertha's part. \" You Avill not think me ungrateful of your kindness if I do not find time to Avrite before Saturday, Grace ? \""], [100, "88 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? \" No, not at all.

The following day, just about noon, Doctor AA'est found his way towards Park Place, to find the Colonel still absent at his club, but Aliss Gorten would be doAA-n directly. So Lee, after accepting an imitation to stay lunch, settled into an exchange of local gossip with Grace ; but, iioav and again, the young man's eyes would rove expectantly over the room, as if some one or something Avas missing, and, after AA-aiting for his hostess to satisfy this void.

So AA'hen the Colonel came in, and Grace told"], [104, "92 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? him of her friend's non-arrival at home, and the Rector's not expecting her till Friday, Lee vehemently supported his previous suggestion as to a relation.

As the doctor retraced his steps he made up his mind to go doAvn to Slade, and if Aliss Lesley had not returned, or informed the Rector of her movements, he, Lee, would no longer keep that burdensome secret of her engagement to Karl Troika.

Soon both father and daughter Avere fully occu pied in helping the injured youth up stairs, and so much absorbed had Bertha become that it hardly surprised her to find Lee AVest on the spot falling into his Avork as on that former occasion at Slade.

Lee said, from exposure to cold or late hours, the young man AA'as in a very Aveak state of health. \" Your son tells me he has had this hacking cough since the middle of September, and his left lung is quite gone.

He had scarcely closed the sitting-room door, Avhen Bertha Lesley came out of the sick room, and detained him just on the top stair, as on that night of Karl Troika's accident. As if foreseeing Avhat Bertha's appeal Avas, Lee was the first to speak, by explaining : \" I am just going back to Bedford Gardens and shall spare no pains to learn his condition. Be sure if he can be helped I Avill do my best.\""], [151, "139 A PISTOL SHOT. The young doctor need hardly have AA'aited for Bertha's ansAver, so truly had he anticipated the request, but he did so, and felt its sting. \" Yes, go and mind you see Karl. Tell him I can bear all if he is safe.\" AA'e are selfish in our griefs, and Bertha's Avords brought a pang of jealousy to Lee's heart, such as he had thought Avas long ago driven out. At number two,AVest found DetectiveAA'hite in possession, and to this officer Lee explained AA-ho he Avas, and in the interest of the Lesley family, asked about Troika, the explanation running as follows : \"You Avere here, sir,\" said the detective, \" Avhen this Troika rushed past Avith a revolver in his hand.

I suppose rather than be taken he turned the revolver on himself,\" commented Lee, sadly. \" No, an Italian Avoman did it \u2014 in fact his own AA'ife, as she declares it. All I can get at is that this Karl Troika had deceived her about something, and they had quarrelled just before he came here.\" \" She had AA'atched him, I suppose ? \" \" Yes, and fancying she had a rival in this house, she waited her time ; Avhen it happened her husband dashed madly towards the spot she had hid herself in.\" \" She saAv him coming then, surely she must have seen he Avas pursued ? \" Lee asked. \" I can't say, but it Avas in self-defence that she fired. Troika recognised her, and she fancied he was going to shoot her, so fired"], [153, "A PISTOL SHOT. 141 straight at his head, and did our Avork as Avell as the laAvyers, only in half a second.\" \" But this Avoman Avas arrested, I suppose \" Yes, and is at the station here, Avhere the hody Avas taken till Ave get a Coroner's order.\" It Avas a terrible sequel, and Lee felt hoAV great a task his Avas to return AAith such tidings as these. For a time the doctor doubted Avhether to go back, or rather Avould it not be better to let the Rector knoAv the facts of the case, and judge for himself Avhether to keep Bertha in suspense rather than reveal the dreadful truth, but then Lee recalled Bertha's agonised face as she bade him find Karl Troika, and it Avas not likely she would be willing to wait and not act, if only an imperfect report of her loAer Avere given her. Thinking thus, Lee West left Bedford Gardens to call at the police station, where he asked for permission to see Karl Troika's corpse, his excuse or reason being that he had known the deceased, and had come on"], [154, "142 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? behalf of others. So, accompanied by an officer, Lee's request Avas granted, and it Avas very painful to the young doctor to gaze on his rival's handsome face, noAV cold and firm in death's chill poAver, still he AA'as glad to see from the expression that death must have come so swiftly that there could have been no pain to bear. As a man of private life, Lee West had never employed any solicitors but the small local firms of the place he might happen at the time to have his practice in, so that he could set no laAvyer to Avork in solving a question that had startled and baffled him in the beginning, and that Avas if this Italian murderess was the cause of Karl Troika's end, Avas she really as she said, his AA'ife ? Now, no doubt, Mr. Lesley had a family solicitor, but then Lee must tell him what he Avanted solving, and thus frustrate a resolution on his, (Lee's) part, of keeping this rumour from Bertha until he knew beyond doubt that Karl Troika had deceived her most shamefully. So"], [155, "143 A PISTOL SHOT. Lee resolved to seek another interview with Detective AArhite, and it Avas then he learnt for the first time that Louis Lesley had helped to inform against Troika, and had accused the Russian of embezzling some invested money belonging to him and his sister. \" You see noAA', sir,\" explained the officer, \" all claims Avill have to be made at once, as AA'hatever the AvidoAv can prove to be her husband's AA'ill go to her.\" \" Then there is legal proof of this Italian's marriage to this man ? \" asked Lee. \" Oh ! certainly, for oAving to great doubts as to Avhat the establishment in Soho Square was, inquiries AA'ere made at the Embassy as to AIr. Troika's connections, and then his relationship to Signor Carrol through his wife AA'as found out and the register of the place Avhere the marriage took place confirmed the statement.\" \" Then if I apply to Scotland Yard, I suppose"], [156, "144 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? they can give me a clue to where the Avedding took place, and what year it was in ? \" \" Certainly, if your reason is satisfactory.

It was close upon midnight, and as the doctor entered the sitting-room he found the Rector deep in the armchair, fast asleep ; but the presence of another coming in woke Mr. Lesley, and he insisted on hearing how Lee had found matters at Bedford Gardens."], [157, "AS HIS WIFE SHE ALONE KNOWS. 145 CHAPTER XI. AS HIS WIFE SHE ALONE KNOAVS. Telling Mr. Lesley of Karl Troika's violent death, and how he had himself seen how quickly the bullet must have killed him, Lee continued : \" I think it might be better to keep the truth from Miss Lesley until to-morroAV. Perhaps, if you went up to your son, and said nothing about my having returned, it would look as if I had broken my promise, and nothing need be said until to-morrow.\" But Lee's subterfuge Avas broken in upon by Bertha Lesley herself, and she saved the doctor any explanation by taking up the words herself : VOL.

Karl Troika is beyond any one's help \u2014 he has been shot.\" \" The cowards, they have maimed him to take him ! \" exclaimed Bertha, not taking her father's words in the literally hopeless way he meant them. \" Where is he now ? I must and will go to him ! \" Here Lee interposed, addressing Mr. Lesley : \" Will you let me speak to Miss Lesley alone ? It will be better for me to explain matters.\" The Rector was quite surprised at Lee now wishing to take the whole explanation upon"], [159, "147 AS HIS WIFE SHE ALONE KNOWS. himself, but he rose from his chair, and assented by leaving the room. Lee's first act was to turn the armchair straight in front of the fire, with its back to the room ; then, standing near the table, he asked Bertha to take her father's seat, and taking up the sentence Mr. Lesley had used, Lee said : \" I AA'ill explain what your father meant, Miss Lesley. On leaving you I went direct to Bedford Gardens, where I found a detective, who explained that Mr. Troika had been injured not in the attempt to take him on the part of the police \" \u2014 and Lee spoke hurriedly, Avithout once turning to the occupant of the armchair, although Bertha's face, owing to his arrange ment of it, was completely hidden from where he stood. \" It was a pistol shot, fired by an Italian woman, named Carrol, and her victim must have died instantly, for the police arrested her on the spot, and could have given help if of any avail.

When I saAv his face \" \u2014 Lee would not pain his hearer by using that familiar name, \u2014 \"he looked at perfect rest. Better to be thus, than judged by his fellow-men, and lead a life-long imprisonment.\" Here Lee paused, awaiting some remark ; but he was hardly prepared for Bertha's mood, for she rose from her kneeling attitude, and coming close to where Lee was, and with tearless eyes looking straight before her, asked :"], [161, "149 AS HIS AVIFE SHE ALONE KNOWS. \" Why do you add to my misery \u2014 you AA'ho knoAv all ?

Aly boys have been staking their all on Avhether it contains a Plantagenet ancestor or a nineteenth century love-lock.\" Grace, Avith the instinct of a young heart, saAv hoAV grating her father's Avords Avere to Lee, and quickly interposed AA-ith the words \u2014 \" And both are AA'rong ; but then they have never lost a sister : although I often tell them they mourn over some favourite dog's death more than they Avould over me, I believe.\" \" No, not that, Grace,\" and the Colonel"], [214, "DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? 202 stooped to kiss his fragile floAver, \" they Avould sorely miss their pet ; but I must be off, if you'll excuse me AVest, for I'm not in evening trim.\" Directly Colonel Gorten had left them Lee thanked Grace for her interposition, adding by Avay of explanation : \" It is not a sister's hair, in the recognised sense of that Avord, but a remembrance of one very dear to me ; Ave all have some shrine of a longing made impossible to be fulfilled, and this is mine, Aliss Gorten.\" AVishing to sympathise, Grace made some remark as to so great a loss by death making life a sad reality, causing Lee to say \u2014 \" You must not think I meant my loss Avas one of death ; thank God that is not so, although we are perhaps, farther apart.\" No remark Avas feasible, so Grace remained thinking, and Lee West, no doubt carrying on the connexion in his oavu mind, broke the silence with the abrupt question \u2014"], [215, "THE LOST LOCKET. 203 \" Have you seen Aliss Lesley lately ? But I forgot, she has not been out yet I expect, and you cannot go to the Rectory.\" \" No, but Bertha has promised to come to me for a Aveek or two. I thought it Avould help her on.\" \" Yes, hoAV good of you, the Rectory stands so Ioav, and it is healthful breezes that she requires.\" And thus conversing, the dinner bell rang, and wheeled in by Roily and the doctor, Grace thought Lee eA'en gentler and more considerate than usual. And Avhen the time for his leaving them came she felt hoAV happy it would make her if it lay in her poAver to carry out that one wish he had revealed. As her two brothers came to bid her good night, Grace took the opportunity of settling the betting affair, by the folloAving Avords : \" Joe, you must pay your bet, for Roily is right. Air. AVest valued his locket for the"], [216, "204 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? lady's hair contained in it \u2014 someone he was engaged to I expect ; but anyhow it Avas a love token.\" \" AVell, I'm ready to pay up, but I thought I kneAv Lee too well to be taken in. I suppose his rose is Bertha Lesley, eh, Grace ? \" \" I never thought of Bertha,\" was Grace's surprised ansAver \u2014 \" but why specially her, Joe ?\" \" Only because of that rose in his locket, it reminded me of the temper AArest got into at that summer fete, AA'hen the Russian felloAv was wearing Bertha's other Gloire de Dijon.\" And Avith this the locket episode ended ; but Grace thought more of Joe's suggestion than she generally did of his remarks, and determined to find out from Bertha, if possible, whether she had refused the doctor. June arrived, and with it the fulfilment of Grace Gorten's plans. And on this very afternoon Bertha Lesley, looking pale and fragile, sat near the invalid's couch in"], [217, "205 THE LOST LOCKET. the drawing room at the Hall. The French windoAvs Avere open, and the laAvn looked deserted for a time, although the tennis net spanned its green level. Bertha Avas in black, and no doubt the sombre hue shoAved up the brilliant carnation of her cheeks in contra distinction to the pallor of her features, Avhile her recently cut hair, brushed off her forehead, gave her a youthful look. Grace Avas lying back on her cushions, simply gazing at the thoughtful look in her friend's eyes, Avhile Bertha interlaced her needle to form that intricate pattern known a6 point d ' Angleterre to all lace Avorkers. As if she had been thinking how to begin, Grace broke the silence Avith the Avords : \" Bertha, have you seen much of Doctor AVest lately ? Last time he Avas here he looked so thin and ill that I Avondered his home people did not come to look after him.\" \" Did he ? No, I have not seen him lately ; but the nurse I had came from Newport. So"], [218, "206 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? his mother and sisters Avould hear all about him.\" \" Yes ; you'd think so,\" Avas Grace's debatable answer ; \" but Mrs. Lowe is an old friend of Lee AA'est's, I think ; so perhaps he would prevent them knoAA'ing.\" \" Then you think the doctor's people did not knoAv of this Mrs. LoAve's coming ? Well, I thought the nursing AA'as only an excuse,\" Bertha added. \" An excuse to get you well nursed ; not anything more ; but, Bertha, I am going to ask you a very impertinent question, and if your ansAver Avould be in the affirmative you need not give me one. What I Avant to knoAV is, have you ever given Lee AVest any lock of hair as a keepsake ? Now, if you have, don't pay any attention to my questions.\" It was noAv Bertha's turn to look puzzled, as she ansAvered, vehemently : \" A lock of hair ? No, never ! Surely Dr."], [219, "THE LOST LOCKET. 207 AA'est never said I had ; because it's a distinct falsehood.\" \" No ; noAv don't get angry, Bertha. He never said Avhose hair it Avas ; it Avas simply my idea. You heard hoAV Roily found his locket. AA'ell, it contained a Gloire de Dijon rose in enamel, surrounded by some plaited hair the exact shade of yours, Bertha.\" \" And mine is so rare a tint that the sun never shone on its like \u2014 is that all, Grace ? \" \" No ; the doctor himself told me it Avas a memento of only a year ago ; and then I con nected the rose Avith that passion the doctor got in the night of joux fete, and, Bertha, it seemed to me he loved you ; and, if so, your indifference is killing him.\" Grace had taken her friend's hand, and half raised herself in her excitement ; Avhile Bertha sat as if spellbound, not uttering a Avord. So Grace continued, explaining: \" I heard yesterday that he had throAvn up his"], [220, "DOCTOR, OR LOVER? 208 Government appointment, on the plea that his health prevented his carrying on his work satisfactorily ; but it really is, he's out of heart with his life. And yet it is a life worth sharing ; for Lee AVest is a man that few can know without respecting.\" Bertha at last made some reply : \" But, Grace, Avhy should I be blamed. AVhy, even if it is as you think, should I suffer, because I have never thought of him in any but a friendly Avay ? \" \" Only because I cannot bear to think so good a man should unlearn a life-long lesson of use fulness. Oh, Bertha ! I would gladly give my existence to make what he deems an impossi bility a possibility.\" Some minutes after, Bertha rose to go upstairs, as she did so stooping to kiss the weak, long suffering invalid, and saying : \" Thank you, Grace, for speaking as you have, and knoAv, dear, that Avhatever happens you will"], [221, "209 THE LOST LOCKET. have been the cause of my acting rightly and not selfishly, at least, and for the rest God alone can direct me.\" And for the future these two hearts Avere knit together in a Avoman's strong loA'e for her OAvn sister. Both kneAv the other's secret cross, and both the manful struggle of a righteous spirit, but Bertha alone could battle Avith feelings that had lain buried only because of the sheer impossibility of revieAving and mastering the sorroAvful past.

CHAPTER XA'I. \" BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.\" Tavo months had passed since Grace Gorten broke upon Bertha Lesley's quietude, and AA'ith September, wet Aveather caused Mr. Lesley to fall a victim to that ancestral tyrant, gout, so that Bertha found less time for thought. Dr. Moore attended his old friend, and except for a call noAv and then, Lee West never came to the Rectory, for he often saAv Mr. Lesley at the Slade Reading-room, and there Avas no one except Bertha that he could make the excuse of coming to see.

Lee, seeing Avho it Avas, and ever thinking of Bertha's likes and dislikes, was about to raise his hat and ride on, but as he drew near, the impulse to hear Bertha's voice, even though its tone was reproachful, mastered Lee's intention, and he dreAv the reins tightly back, and began enquiring after the Rector. AVhile Bertha looked up at him, her friend's words of tAvo months' back forced themselves on her mind, as Lee's pale face and dull-looking eyes Avere so closely seen. Bertha ansAvered the doctor's enquiry as to her father, and then, Avith a voice struggling against constraint, she continued: \" And now I Avant to thank you for helping me back to life, for since I spoke those hasty words I have learnt to value the gift, and can thank you from my heart for all your kindness when I was so ill.\" p\u2014 2"], [224, "DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? 212 Lee West Avas so overcome by the Avords that, although he had dismounted directly Bertha had begun to speak, still he stood beside her for a moment overwhelmed Avith a great joy ; then, as Bertha finished speaking, another and bitter thought came to him. Was it for her OAvn joy of life that she was thanking him, or for some neAv, recent happiness that had made that life of value, and Avith a bitter, galling sarcasm, Lee answered, as if beside himself : \" Is it for your own sake you thank me ? No that cannot be, Bertha ! \" and Lee seized the girl's hand, letting go the bridle rein as he turned to her in all the earnestness of entreaty. \" Can it be, that for some one else's sake you have learnt to treasure life ?

The Doctor had taken possession of Bertha's other hand, and she stood before him, her head bent to the torrent of his words, AA'hile he, fearful of the ansAver, and yet burning to knoAv his fate, broke out again into pleading : \" It is nothing more than a brother's place I crave, and yet so surely do I knoAv the deep love I bear you, that if you do not, cannot, grant me that, I care not, for I cannot live any longer this aimless, useless life.\" \" Hush !

She Avas conquered, and said, gently, almost inaudibly : \" I Will be yours.

Certainly Bertha had knoAA'n Avhat it Avas to love ere this, but she could not know a more true and fierce loA'e than that of the man to whom she had just entrusted her future, and Avho thus sealed the promise. To her father, Bertha did not mention having met Doctor AA'est, but as is often the case, Mr. Lesley seemed quite absorbed Avith some neAvs concerning Lee that he had heard from his friend Aloore. \" Moore Avas AAith me over an hour,\" explained the Rector, \" he tells me he's going"], [228, "DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? 216 to retire, and has offered AVest the full practice,. but, although Lee's throAvn up his Government appointment, he seems unAvilling to tie himself by taking Aloore's offer.

Father and daughter Avere still at tea, Avhen the door bell rang, and Alice came in with a message that Dr. AVest Avished to see her master ! As Lee sent a refusal to join them at tea, Mr' Lesley rose to join him in the draAving room, adding to Bertha as he did so \u2014 \" Come in as soon as you can, Bertha, and support my proposal that this offer of Moore's be accepted.\""], [229, "\"BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.' 217 A rather bitter smile rose to the girl's lips, as she thought there was little doubt but Avhat her father himself Avould be asked to accept Lee himself as a son-in-laAv, and haA'ing rang the bell for the tea tray to be removed, Bertha Avent doAA-n the passage to the morning room. There she seated herself on the sofa, and took up a book she had been reading ere she AA'ent out for her walk : but no attention could the volume claim, for was not one she could not, and did not pretend to loA-e, gaining an easy consent to her being his for life ? A minute or tAvo later and, Avith a gentle tap at the door, Lee AVest entered ; his look told Bertha the Avords he was about to speak : \" Bertha, I have your father's full consent to make you mine, love.\" And breaking through any ordinary greeting of mere friendship, Lee kissed her he loved, and, although Bertha never returned this greeting until the evening of the day previous to"], [230, "DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? 218 becoming his Avife, Lee AVest inA'ariably claimed a more than ordinary betrothed right as his each time they met. On the evening prior to their union Lee had Avaited rather later before coming up to the Rectory, as, Avithout asking Bertha, he had procured a license for the morrow's ceremony, to avoid the Sunday's crying at the corner of the streets, so that on coming in at the Rectory door, Lee Avent straight to the library, expecting to find Mr. Lesley there. But at a glance he saw Bertha Avas the sole occupant, and she came to meet him, and for the first time kissed him. Lee placed his arm lovingly round her, and looking doAvn into her soft eyes murmured : \" My love ! my Bertha ! I do not deserve this.\" And moving tOAvards a chair, Lee drew Bertha doAvn on his knee, and imprinted, perhaps, even a warmer greeting than ever on his love's cheeks, while Bertha replied to his first words :"], [231, "\"BECAUSE I LOA'E YOU.\" 219 \" Lee, you must not say you don't deserve my love, after all you have sacrificed for me.\" \" But, Bertha, I do not deserve it now more than Avhen I first told you of my great love for you ; for to-night I cannot love you more or shoAv my love is, or could be, more firm than it Avas then.\" \" But you have taught me to love you more, Lee. Yes, I would not deceive you ; and yet, as I Avas Avaiting for you this evening, I kneAv that my kiss Avould be only a small token of the feeling in my heart, and, from to-morrow, I will strive my best to nourish that feeling in return for your noble goodness to me.\" And Lee Avas very happy as he listened to this voluntary response to his OAvn constant love, and knew that the ceremony of the morning would not but outwardly join them together, for already Bertha's heart Avas his, and his life's happiness was realised. Once united, the doctor was content to make"], [232, "220 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? his home at the Rectory, knowing how lonely Mr. Lesley's life would be without his only child. But Lee had bought old Doctor Moore's practice, and with it his house and surgery, so, to enables Bertha to be AAith her father as long as he lived, Lee took a married partner into the practice, who was to be his tenant and thus make himself responsible for the night work, Lee being accessible only through his partner, who could call him up at the Rectory if necessary.
