It is a remarkable fact in the present position of Euro pean politics that Turkey, notwithstanding the importance of the part she is called upon to play, and in spite of steam navigation and of the progress made in statistical science, continues to be almost as much an unknown country as she was during the two last centuries. Our diplomatic relations were then based upon the mere out line of historical tradition, followed uninterruptedly from Francis I. to Louis XIV., and continued during the fol lowing reign, though its insufficiency to furnish a clear and simple view of the situation began to be felt. It mattered little that the writers of the day repeated with alarm the intelligence of the journalist Renaudot,\u2014 that the \" galleys of the Turk had been seen in the waters of Aigues Mortes,\" or that the standard \" of the false pro phet Mahomet was floating on the towers of Saint Mark;\" provided always that the political principles upon which were founded the first negotiations of Francis I. with the Levant were being adhered to by his successors with that unity of purpose which a hereditary government alone can ensure.

At the present day it is different. What is called the Eastern Question occupies the attention, not only of the cabinets of Europe, but of most private individuals, who, on one side, hail the present as an opportunity of driving the Turks back into Asia, and on the other, allege the importance of - maintaining and consolidating the Turkish empire in Europe. But what is this Turkey, now trembling in the balance of so terrible a \" to be or not to be?\" AVhat are her component parts? What arguments, as to her probable preservation or downfall, may be drawn from her political constitution, her internal organization, her military strength, her finances, her resources of all kinds? On all these points we axe ignorant. Even the geography of Turkey is but imperfectly known : the maps and gazet- teers are filled with errors ; and the names of the natural divisions of countries are frequently confounded with their political denominations. For instance, Balbi, who, like his predecessors, divides Turkey in Europe into four governments, bestows upon Thrace ( Tchirmen) the name of Roumelia, an appellation employed by the Turks to designate all that part of the empire which is situated in Europe, or, to speak more precisely, \u2014 one of their admin- istrative divisions, which includes Albania and a part of Macedonia. Not only does he class Wallachia, Moldavia, Servia, and other tributary provinces as distinct states, without any real dependence on the Porte ; but he nearly fails into the error of considering Kurdistan and Diarbe kir as detached portions of the empire, because some"], [17, "Introd. PRINCIPLE OF UNITY. \u25a0'\u2022 districts of these provinces had enjoyed certain privileges, momentarily conceded to them by the Porte, but of which there remain now very slight traces, in consequence of the \u2022r unity of the political and administrative system recently introduced in Turkey. This principle of unity, the result of repeated efforts, which forms the basis of the new organization, is perhaps the most certain index of the ultimate regeneration of the Ottoman empire, especially if we consider the appa rently insurmountable obstacles encountered in this direc tion by the reforming spirit of Mahmoud, and the present Sultan. Let. us look back fifty or sixty years, \u2014 to the close of the eighteenth century. At that epoch Turkey, which had for ages threatened the West with an invasion that would have not only changed the political aspects of Europe, but would have shaken all civilisation to its basis, had been expelled foot by foot from the territories she had acquired, and inert and feeble as a body from which the life is ebbing, seemed destined to expire in the shadow cast over her by advancing Russia. That union of the military and religious spirit, the strongest perhaps which had ever existed, and which once threatened to absorb the world, was dissolving under the influence of time and the gradual decay of the expansive energy which distinguished Islamism at its birth. Symptoms of decomposition were everywhere apparent. Not only did the newly-acquired territories, the conquered states and kingdoms, detach themselves from the declining empire, returning to their ancient masters, or to their former independence, but the original domains of the race of Osman began to escape from the feeble hands of his B 2"], [18, "Introd. LETTERS ON TURKEY. 4 successors. The fair and fertile provinces of Anatolia became gradually the prey of \"Dere-beys\" and revolted Pashas : as in the cases of Tirsemikli-Oghlou, the pre cursor of the grand vizier Bairaktar, at Silistria ; Pazvan Oghlou, in the rest of Bulgaria ; the Davis, in Servia ; Kalyondji, in Khoudavendguiar, whom it required two separate expeditions to subdue : Tchapan-Oghlou, whom some travellers have complimented with the title of Prince of Yozghat, in central Asia Minor, from Kianguire, Angora, and Amasia, to Caramania and the shores of the Mediterranean ; the Kara Osman-Oghlous, at the very gates of Smyrna ; Kutchuk Ali, in Cilicia ; the beys of Mesopotamia ; the elective pashas of Bagdad : the Mamelukes in Egypt. These \" princes of the valleys,\" as their name imports, whose number and audacity increased in proportion as the energy of the central power decayed, were in pos session of nearly three-fourths of the territory of the empire, so that the authority of the Sultans, \u2014 as formerly that of the C\u00e6sars of Byzantium, \u2014 was almost confined to the immediate precincts of Constantinople. There were in Kurdistan and Diarbekir alone several thousands of these chieftains, some of whom were in a condition to bring fifty thousand men into the field, by uniting beneath their banner the nomadic hordes of the neio-hbouringr ***** \u00a9 plains and mountains. Even at the present day the tra veller in Asia Minor observes occasionally, situated at the entrance of a valley, or commanding a mountainous defile, castles of which the Turkish names, such as Kara Hissar, Biledjik, Lefke, recall their Byzantine origia Sheltered behind their walls, like the petty tyrants of"], [19, "Tail 1. IMPOTENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT. 5 ancient Greece, or the feudal lords of our own middle ages, the owners defied the firmans of the Porte, and laid upon all the surrounding population, Turkish or Baia, the iron hand of a despotism secure of impunity. From time to time, it is true, some rebel pasha fell dead at the conclusion of a banquet, or some Dere-bey was found a corpse in the morning, the fetva of the mufti nailed by a poniard to his breast. These examples served to attest that there yet lingered some remains of authority within the walls of the ancient imperial palace ; but the very secrecy with whicli this terrible justice was administered betrayed tlie weakness of the executive, and after a short interval of stupor, things returned to their former course. As a characteristic trait of these times of anarchy, when power Mas at once everywhere and nowhere, \u2014 everywhere for the purpose of maintaining abuses, nowhere for the vindicating the right, \u2014 it is to be remarked that the Arab tribes of Bagdad and Syria, instead of paying the tribute due to the imperial trea sury, made frequent incursions into these provinces, and only quitted them on payment of a ransom by their governors. The Turks themselves confess the weakness, the abso lute impotence of the imperial administration at the epoch of which we speak ; they even place its origin still earlier. \" It is now a hundred and fifty years,\" says an official document recently published at Constantinople, \" sitiee certain governors-general, denominated Dere-beys, exercisino- undue power and tyranny towards the inhabit ants of the country, disposed of their possessions, and steeped the provinces of the empire in blood, while the"], [20, "Introd. 6 LETTERS ON TURKEY. sovereign authority, witness of these disorders, unable to repress them.\" The precise epoch from whence the Turks date the decadence of the empire is worthy of remark, because it serves not only to attest the facts, but also in some degree to explain the causes. These causes were the opposite progress of the West and the East \u2014 the middle age period terminating in the former to recommence in the latter ; feudality, extinguished in Europe, dawning in Asia ; Turkey inert and motionless amidst the changes and revolutions through which the states of Christendom were struggling towards definite constitution. A hundred and fifty years ago, France was subject to the principle of monarchical unity, of which the foundations were laid by Louis XV., and perfected by Richelieu ; constitutional government was gaining strength in England : the Italian republics were extinct ; the German states were being absorbed one by one in the house of Austria; the genius of Peter the Great had recently given Russia the first impulse towards that career of progress and material aggrandisement in which she has ever since continued to advance ; Spain alone, where the spirit of the East was latent, was like Turkey, decadent. While the nations of the West, differently influenced by the spirit of the age, were working out their several developments with more or less of energy, Turkey remained quiescent, in the original conditions of her existence. A lapse of two centuries and a half found her what she had been in the first moments of her con quest, \u2014 an army, not a people; sh$ was perishing, not only of her own inertia, but her strength diminished in proportion as that of the neighbouring states increased."], [21, "Introd. INDISPOSITION TO CHANGE. 7 Unfortunately, Musulman pride, when compelled te recognise its fall, instead of connecting it with the true causes, sought to attribute it to a will superior to that of humanity : \u2014 \" Each nation hath its allotted term ; when the term has arrived, man is powerless to hasten or to retard it.\" Connecting these words of the Koran with an ancient tradition, which led the Turks to consider themselves as* only temporarily encamped, as it were, in Europe, the devout Osmanlis held themselves ever ready to re-cross the Bosphorus as soon as Constantinople should be wrested from them. The Janissaries, who had con stituted the strength of the empire, and been irresistible in the field so long as Europe could only bring against them irregular and undisciplined troops, violently opposed the introduction of modern military science and tactics, and were determinedly hostile to all proposed reforms ; pre ferring rather to perish with their country than to save it at the expense of a change. Sint ut sunt, cut non sint. The Ulemas, and most of the religious orders who con stituted a species of priesthood in Islam, contrary to the express principle of the Koran, made common cause with the Janissaries, and assisted them to the utmost in endea vouring to preserve Turkey in a state of isolation, which must hasten her ruin while deferring their own. In a state of society where the religious principle not only influences but absorbs all others, every political or social revolution must in its origin assume a religious form. It is impossible to introduce changes into man ners, institutions, government, without at the same time extending them to religion. Turkey could alone be saved by a different direction of those same influences which"], [22, "Introd. 8 LETTERS ON TURKEY. threatened her fall. Remaining essentially the same, these principles required a new development. Mahmoud, first among the sovereigns of Islam, comprehended this truth, and, as the first step towards the regeneration of bis empire, essayed to introduce a wider interpretation of the doctrines contained in the Koran. He changed nothing of the letter of the law ; but, modifying the spirit accord ing to the exigencies of his political system, as Mahomet himself had done, he fulfilled the original intentions of the founder. The enlightened thinkers of Islam, reject ing the veil of sanctity and mysticism in which the dogmas of the Koran were shrouded, had long arrived at a purely philosophical interpretation of its doctrines. Mahmoud turned the arms of his opponents against them selves. Regardless of the epithet of giaour (infidel) hurled at him from all sides, it was in the name of reli gion that he dispersed the religious orders, destroyed the Janissaries, and established his principal reforms. It is written in the Book, \" It is lawful to employ the arms of the infidel for his destruction;\" and the Sultan introduced European arms and discipline among his troops. It is written again, \" Go in search of Light even unto China ;\" and Mahmoud hesitated not to avail himself of the science and invention of the West. Thus, one by one, he removed the barriers which separated Turkey from the rest of Europe. His whole life was consecrated to this labour, which he pursued with the constant and unvarying energy which was the chief feature in his cha racter.

The fall of the dreaded Ali of Tepeleni, pasha of Janina, struck terror to the hearts of the revolted pashas of Widdin and Bagdad ; Albania was reduced, the Mamelukes were subdued, the Afghans and Wahabis restrained, and the different portions of the empire brought under that system of centralization which was necessary to carry out the new political and adminis trative organization founded by Mahmoud, and com pleted bv his successor the present sultan, under the name of Tanzimat. The task I propose to myself is to explain this Tanzi mat, or new organization of Turkey, considering succes sively, and in detail, its various branches \u2014 policy, admi nistration, government, national worship, public instruc tion, army, marine, finance, &c. ; all of which points are little understood and imperfectly appreciated in Europe, but which serve to show that the Turkish empire, which it has been proposed to drive back across the Bosphorus, is tending, on the contrary, as M.

In saying this, it is not my .intention to prejudge the political question now in agitation. My object is simply to point out a fact, of which the extreme importance cannot be denied, if considered merely with reference to the philosophy of history, and to its effect upon the general constitution of Europe. We cannot look upon the extinction or regeneration of an empire so considerable as that of Turkey, and holding so con spicuous a place in history, simply as admiring spectators ; a nearer interest is elicited by the disturbing influence her fate must exert upon the balance of power in Europe. But, before attacking the great question \u2014 Is Turkey to be reorganized or dismembered ? \u2014 -it would be weli, methinks, to preface it by another : \u2014 Does Turkey really exist ? And it is to this latter alone that I under take to reply. It is impossible to convey a just idea of Turkey without. taking into consideration the different races which people her territory, from the Carpathian mountains to the deserts of Yemen, from the frontiers of Persia to the shores of the Mediterranean. This question of race has become a very important element in modern politics, and derives fresh interest from the nationalities which have begun to awaken on all sides, and to borrow strength from affinities of origin and language. The problem is indeed a most extensive one, and upon its solution may depend the future destinies, not only of Turkey and the countries more immediately interested in it, but ultimately even of European nations, whose political unity has been long settled. No European state, it must be owned, is composed of elements so varied and heterogeneous as the"], [25, "Introd. 11 POPULATION. Turkish empire. It is not a nation ; it is an agglomera tion of nations.1 The conquering race forms at most one-third of a population of thirty-five millions. The remainder is composed of Greeks, Armenians, Jews, Roumains, Sclavonians, Albanians, Arabs, &c, each re taining their distinct individuality and physiognomy. All races, religions, dialects of the old continent are found side by side in the vast and peaceful domains of the Sultan. Here we find Abyssins and Zingani (gypsies), who are for the most part Pagans ; \u2014 there, Chaldeans, \u2014 professing the heresy of Nestorius, Chemsinyes worshippers of the sun, Yezidis, whose faith is a Manicheism modified by the doctrines of Zoroaster ; on one hand are the impious sects of the Abi-Ilahis and the Ismailians, \u2014 and the Wahabis, the Protestants of Islamism ; on the other the Kurds. \u2014 -descendants of the ancient Parthians, and in heritors of their language and modes of warfare, and the nomadic tribes of the Turkomans, \u2014 relics of the conquer ing hordes of the Seldjucides.

So strange a sight must excite his curiosity as to the cause. Ordinarily, after a struggle of more or less duration, a conquered race is absorbed in the conquering one ; as the Gallo-Romans became fused with the Franks, and the Saxons with the \u25a0' An old proverb fixes the number of nations forming part of the Ottoman empire at and a half."], [26, "Introd. 12 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Normans. The Turks alone, like the Arabs in Spain, from a contemptuous and short-sighted policy, refused to ally themselves with the conquered nations of the Lower Empire ; and now, after a lapse of four centuries, these races, who then seemed on the eve of extinction, assert themselves stronger, more vigorous, more energetic than even before their subjugation. To what causes must we attribute this phenomenon ? I think partly to the character of the conquest itself, and partly to a peculiar spirit inherent in the Asiatics, and especially in the Musulman nations. On entering one of the cities which were buried beneath the ashes of Mount Vesuvius, we gaze with surprise on objects which, after a lapse of eighteen centuries, seem to wear the freshness of yesterday. Such was the effect of Turkish invasion. It overwhelmed countries as with a lava flood, \u2014 but it over whelmed to preserve. In fact, as an English writer has very justly observed, Turkish oppression was often violent and irresistible, but never constant nor systematic. The country had not to complain of privileged classes nor private interests, if we except the radical distinction, maintained from the beginning, between the Raias and the Musulmans. The Turks were the governing body, and as such were separated from the mass of the popula tion, occupied with agriculture and commerce. But their government always wanted that administrative force, which, generalizing and uniting all individual interests, ends by consolidating them with itself ; and this want of organization on the one hand, and the distinctions to which we have alluded on the other, were the causes which combined most potently to maintain the individuality"], [27, "Introd, RACES. 13 of races, which the recent declaration of equality of rights, contained in the Hatti-sherif of Gulhaneh, has contributed no less remarkably to weaken and dissolve.

The answer to these ouestions can only be found by a careful comparison of their situation, their strength, their re sources, their spirit, the point of moral development and material progress at which they may have arrived. How ever this may be, it is impossible to deny that the desti nies of these races are indissolubly connected with those of Turkey ; and on this ground, the consideration of them forms a necessary appendix to these Letters,2 the object of which is to afford a short but correct account of the whole Ottoman empire. 2 It will form the subject of a future volume."], [28, "L 14 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

It comprehends the new political and administrative organization which has been in force in Turkey since 1844, and which may be arranged under four distinct heads or categories. The Arabic word Tanzimat, plural of tanzim (organi zation), does not denote, as has been erroneously supposed, a new order of things, but, on the contrary, a regeneration or return to the ancient system, into which abuses had crept, owing to lapse of time and the usurpation of power by the C2"], [42, "28 Letter II.

They maintain that neither the Tanzimat nor the Hatti-sherif of Gulhaneh have introduced any innovation in the government or admini stration ; that their only effect has been to remodel both of them on the ancient basis, and in the true spirit of Islamism. This view, which I believe has not hitherto been fully understood, throws considerable light upon the differences which have arisen among the reforming party in Turkey ; some individuals contending for a system of reform which should be national, or based upon the ancient institutions of the country, others for one modelled exclusively upon those of Europe. I have already stated that the germ of the Tanzimat is to be found in the Hatti-sherif of Gulhaneh.

In their pre sence, Reshid Pasha, then minister for foreign affairs, read aloud the Hatti-sherif issued by sovereign autho rity, which laid the foundations of the new constitution of the Turkish Empire. The preamble of this charter, as it has been called, is very remarkable. It runs thus : \u2014 \" It is known to all men, that in the early years of the Ottoman dominion the glorious precepts of the Koran and the laws of the empire were honoured and obeyed. The empire consequently increased in power and in grandeur, and all its subjects enjoyed the highest degree of prosperity. But, from a succession of accidents and a variety of causes within the last hundred and fifty years, the sacred law, and the regulations founded upon it, are no longer properly observed ; and our former strength and prosperity are changed into weakness and poverty ; because a nation must lose all stability when it ceases to observe the laws. These considerations are ever present to our mind ; and, since the day of our accession to the throne, our thoughts have been entirely occupied with projects for the public good \u2014 the amelioration of the state of our provinces and the relief of the population. It must be evident to all who consider the geographical position of the Ottoman provinces, the fertility of the soil, the aptitude and intelligence of the inhabitants, that, by applying ourselves to discover the most effectual means, we may trust, with the blessing of God, to arrive, in the space of a few years, at the desired result.

The Sultan not only engaged him self by oath to observe scrupulously the conditions of the Hatti-sherif (the original of which was deposited in the chamber wherein the mantle of the Prophet is preserved), but also to sanction whatever measures might be required to give effect to these three principal points, which were to constitute the basis of a whole superstructure of reform. The Tanzimat, in fact, which was soon after established, and the application of which has ever since been pursued by the Government with a zeal and perse verance worthy of all praise, was not confined to the civil, political, and administrative improvement of the empire, by regulating anti systematizing the different branches of the executive, but it included also the internal economy of the imperial palace \u2014 the consequence has been the reduction, year by year, of expensive law dignities, and the suppression of useless offices, all which it is the object of the present reform to remove.

The title of Padishah, from the Persian pad (protector) and shah (king), belongs exclusively in the East to the Ottoman sovereigns. Francis I. of France was the first, and for a long time the only, Christian monarch who received this title from the Turks.

The title of Padishah has been since extended to most of the European sove reigns, allies of the Porte.3 The word sultan, metamorphosed by the writers of the middle ages into soldan, answers to our word prince, in all its acceptations, which signify relationship, more or less remote, with the throne, or imperial or royal descent.

The coronation and anointing, customary with the monarchs of the West, are replaced, among the Ottomans, by the ceremony of the Taklidi seif or investiture of the sabre, which takes place the fifth or sixth day after the accession of a new sovereign. The new emperor, accom panied by all the chief dignitaries and by the body of ulemas, goes to the mosque of Eyoub, venerated on account of the tomb of Eyoub, the favourite disciple of, the Prophet ; and there the Sheikh of the MevlM dervishes invests him with the sabre of Osman, with the usual ceremonies. The Sultan is the representative and the depositary of the law ; with him alone rests its execution, and he has even power to modify certain portions, provided its essen tial and fundamental character remains intact. His ordi nances are termed Hatti-sherif (the illustrious writing), or Hatti-humaioun (the august writing), or simply Hat (the writing), because every document sent to the official depart ment*! bears at the top, besides the ordinary signature (touhra), a short line oshis writing, such as Moudjibindje 'amel olovna (let this accordingly be performed).

The word, borrowed from the Arabic, signifies properly '\u2022 bearer of burdens,\" and indicates that the bearer of this title supports the whole weight of public affairs. The Grand Vizier is in fact the supreme, and in some sense the sole, head of the admi nistration, all the other ministers being in their separate departments subject to his authority. Nothing can be presented to the Sultan except through his medium ; nothing is decided, proprio motu, the execution of which does not pass through his hands. He is president of the privy council, disposes of the greater number of offices, commands the army, either in person or by his deputies, countersigns the minutes of all decrees ; in a word, he is the head of the executive power, but only exercises it as the Sultan's delegate and in his name.

Council of State and Justice (Medjlisi valai ahkiami adliie). \u2014 At the head of these councils is the Council of State and of Justice, or Supreme Council, instituted in 1840. It is composed of a President, ex-officio member of the Privy Council, and of two secretaries. The manner as well as the form of its deliberations has been deter mined by special regulations, proposed by the council of ministers, and approved by the Sultan. The Supreme Council prepares and frames the laws, which are subsequently promulgated in the form of impe rial decrees.

As a court of justice, the Supreme Council takes cognizance of all crimes against the State, as well as of abuses committed by high functionaries of the empire during the performance of their duties. The ex-Grand- Vizier, Khosrew Pasha, was summoned before this tribunal in 1841, and condemned for embezzlement of the public money. This court also revises all sentences in criminal cases, and no capital puuishment can take place, throughout the empire, without the express warrant of the Sultan, granted on the report of the council, after due con sideration of the legal documents and evidence connected with the trial, which are transmitted to it by the local authorities. 2.

Under the three first sultans the Ottoman kingdom was divided into minor governments, called Livas or Sandjaks, that is to say, standards or ensigns, whose chiefs, Mir livas or Saudjak-Beys, were distinguished by a single horse-tail (Tough). These chiefs were subordinate to two governors-general, the one of Roumelia, the other of Anatolia, names under which all the Ottoman dominions in Europe and Asia were at that time known. They bore the title of Begler-Bey or Mir-miran, and were entitled to the distinction of being preceded by two or three horse-tails.

The governors of these Eyalets were styled viziers (or pashas with three horse-tails), and the commandants of Livas were raised to the rank of Mir-miran or pasha with two horse-tails. At the time when D'Ohsson, from whom we take these details, wrote, the empire was divided into 26 Eyalets, forming 163 provinces, which included 1800 districts, called Cazas, departments or jurisdictions, some of them being formed of a single city and its dependencies; others, of cantons (Nah, . with many towns and villages. This division lasted until 1834. Sultan Mahmoud then made a new division of the imperial provinces into 28 governments, 31 sandjaks, and 54 independent woiwodes. At present, the Ottoman empire contains 36 General Governments, called Eyalets, subdivided into provinces (Livas or Sandjaks) ; the Livas into Kazas or districts ; the Kazas into Nahizehs, composed of villages and hamlets.

To solve this question, upon which the prospects of reform depend, we must go back to the real principles of the Koran, and inquire into the constitution of the religious bodies in Turkey. The' doctrine of the Koran, regarded apart from the political idea which governs it, is rather a system of philosophy than of rehgion \u2014 if by religion we un- derstand a collection of dogmas and mysteries, which influence and enslave men's minds by exceeding their comprehension. Practically, the fifty-eight command- ments contained in the abridgment of Omar Ness-efi, taught as a catechism in all Turkish schools, and which contain the very essence of the doctrine of Islamism, may be reduced to one single dogma, which contains all the others, the belief iu the Unity of God, as set forth in this verse of the Koran : \u2014 - \" Men kali, la illah il Allah, dakhal-el-djennet.\" \" He who hath said There is but one God, (that man) nath entered into Paradise.\""], [67, "Letter III.

He hath no equal.\" It is true that the Musulmans add to thi*.' the belief in the mission of Mohammed, as the prophet of God, pro claimed five times a day by the Muezzins, from the tops of their minarets, and which may be justly consi dered as the Musulman creed : \u2014 \" La ilahe illallah ve Muhammed resold Allah.\" \" There is no God but God ; and Mohammed (is) the messenger ' of God.\" The doctrine of inspiration can be defended philoso phically, whilst the revelation upon which the Mosaic religion rests, and the doctrine of the Incarnation, which is the foundation of Christianity, are based upon a theo logical foundation beyond the limits of human reason. The Koran says, \" God speaks not to man [ch. xlii. z. 50] : if he does, it is by inspiration, Kavoul Allah (the voice of God), or through a veil.\" The belief in the divine mission of the Prophet is founded on this verse of the Koran : \u2014 \" We have en lightened him with our knowledge ;\" 2 and on the words of Mohammed himself : \" To him who acts after his know- i. to him hath God bequeathed an insight into that 1 Sesoul.

Mohammed is the seal : that is to say, he closes the list of all the prophets sent by God at different times upon earth to maintain or re-establish the true religion. For this reason he is the greatest of prophets \u2014 superior to his predecessors, Moses, David, and Jesus Christ,3 as the Koran is above the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the Gospels, and all other divine books. We may therefore ae that the Turks regard the Mosaic, Christian, and Mohammedan dispensations not as different religions (for, as there is but one God, so tliere has never been more than one true doctrine upon earth), but as successive trans formations of the same religion, resulting one from the other, and each indicating a new step in the progress of humanity. Now, since the mission of Mohammed was final, and that no other prophet is to be looked for after him on earth, except Jesus Christ, who will return at the end of time to convert all nations to Islamism, does it follow from thence that human progress is arrested ? Is the Koran 3 The Musulmans entertain a great veneration for Jesus * v.-hom they designate (Rouh Allah) the Spirit of God. On uo account would they hear of the removal of a Christian relic.

And as. to the belief in miracles, purga tory, the doctrine of expiation, and the imputation of merits, none of these sources of the power of the Ca tholic clergy exist in Islam. The fast of Ramazan, the pilgrimage to Mecca, which might appear to have been instituted in a spirit of mortification and penance, are purely outward observances, intended by the founder to have a moral and political sense, and only became invested with a religious character at a considerably later period, when the Ulema had succeeded in establishing a species of priesthood in Islam. For we must remark, as an addi tional proof of the philosophical spirit of the Koran, that the separation of the spiritual power, and the existence of an ecclesiastical society in the bosom of religious society, are directly opposed to the words of the Prophet himself. Even to this day in Turkey, the priest, or, to speak more correctly, the minister, upon whom devolves the conduct of public worship, is in no way distinguished from the congregation of his fellow believers. Ills func tions do not. as in the Romish church, confer on him a distinct and sacred character.

THE KORAN. By a natural, though an unforeseen consequence, at the same time that the religious dogma of the Koran results in a comprehensive deism, amounting to the actual negation of all exclusive dogmas, it leads, in its moral and political tendencies, to doctrines of the most liberal and progressive nature. All the essential prin ciples of modern democracy are to be found there, not merely in embryo, but expressed in the most decided manner. The Turks at the present day dread republican institutions, and have even ceased to entertain just ideas of them, in proportion as the spirit of their own primitive institutions has disappeared. The word \" Eepublic\" alarms them because they believe it to be synonymous with dis order and anarchy, \u2014 not the idea itself, which is the foundation of the Musulman's social system. A Turk inquired the meaning of the words \" Liberte, Egalite, Fratemite,\" engraved on a piece of French money. \" Allah Kerim, God is great ! \" he exclaimed. \" That which the infidels write on coins of gold or silver, God has written on the heart of every true Musulman ! \" In fact, setting aside political liberty, which does not exist in Turkey, at least under the form in which we are accustomed to see it, there is perhaps no country in the world where the institutions, and especially the social habits, are more deeply imbued with the principle of absolute equality ; and this has been the case from the earliest times of Islamism. Long before the appearance of Mohammed, many aristocratic prejudices and distinc tions of tribes, races, and families, had prevailed among the Arabs. He himself belonged, as is well known, to a privileged caste or tribe, that of the Koreish, on whom for D 3"], [72, "Letter UL 58 LETTERS ON TURKEY. centuries had devolved the care of the Kaaba;' or square temple of Mecca, wrested by the Prophet from idolaters to become the sanctuary of the new faith. Moham med undertook to demolish all these class distinctions, and to found a democratic society on the ruins of the Arab oligarchies. Throughout the Koran, in his ex hortations, in his apparently most simple acts, this aim is visible. He did not assume any superhuman character, he even avoided carefully whatever might distinguish him from other men. \" He did not strut like the proud,\" say his biographers ; \" he carried not his head erect, as the disdainful man : wherever he might be, he claimed neither plaee nor rank as his right.\" \" When he mingles with the people to announce to them the word of God, or when he teaches his disciples, he arranges his hearers in a circle and sits down indifferently amongst them.\" The death of one of his sons being shortly followed by an eclipse of the sun, and some of the Ashabs 6 speaking in their discourses of the two events as having a connection with each other, he reproved them severely by the follow ing Hadis : \" The sun and moon are two great works of \u25a0* Even before the birth of Mohammed, the Keaheh, or Koala, was the object of peculiar veneration, on account of its reputed holiness, among the idolatrous Arabs.

In the time of the first Caliph, Abou-Bekir, a king of the Arnaouts,7 recently converted to Islamism, who was paying his de votions at the Kaaba, was jostled by a poor pilgrim as they both bowed down to kiss the sacred stone. The king turned in anger, and gave the poor pilgrim a blow. The pilgrim having laid his complaint before the Caliph, was directed to return the blow he had received : and on the king protesting against the humiliation of this sentence, pleading his quality of king and his adversary's condition as a beggar, the Caliph replied, \" There are neither kings nor beggars in Islam ; there are only Musulmans.\" In fact the pilgrimage to Mecca was not instituted merely for the purpose of uniting together the scattered members of the great Musulman family ; it was especially intended to remind the faithful, who mingled in prayer, of the equality which ought to subsist among disciples of the same faith. A similar intention influenced the establish ment of the month of fasting, the Ramazan. This period of voluntary abstinence, observed with religious severity by all Musulmans, and which institutes a temporary equality between rich and poor, was established solely with a view to the great principle on which Mohammed based his system of morals. If we seek a noble example 7 Albanians or Skipetaie3: see p. 21."], [74, "Letter III. 60 LETTERS ON TURKEY. of that moral equality, which among us is not even to be found on the threshold of the house of God, not even at the entrance to the tomb, \u2014 let us enter a mosque : there we shall behold no vain ornaments worthless in the sight Divine Majesty, and tending to divert the attention ofthe faithful from their prayers ; we shall see nothing but a few verses of the Koran inscribed on the wTalls, two pulpits, and mats or carpets scrupulously clean for the knees of the worshippers ; no pews, no seats of honour, no reserved , \u2014 only men engaged in prayer, abstracted and absorbed in their devotions.

On quitting the temple, we find the Medressehs or cells of the poor students, Imarets or asylums for the poor and for travellers, and the hospitals for th and infirm.

And the most prejudiced opponents of the Turks ancl of Musulman principles are forced to acknowledge, as a fact which has become proverbial, the universal prevalence of this unlimited benevolence, which is exer cised without distinction of religion, and regardless of private animosities, even to the point of total self-impo verishment (as Tacitus has recorded of the ancient Ger mans) ; practised not only in the towns, but over all the vast extent of roads, where public and private munificence has provided for the support and safety of the indigent traveller ; directed not . only towards human beings, but to all created animals. \" There are no poor found in Turkey,\" writes a man who will certainly not be sus pected of partiality towards the Turks, \" not because every one is alike poor, but because everywhere hands are stretched out to relieve the unfortunate.

The religious sentiment invests the meanest among them with a certain self-respect, which they rarely transgress. If Islamism could shake off the fetters of fatalism, intolerance, and polygamy, the Ottoman empire might have some chance of surviving, but it is to be feared that it will perish before it attempts to reform.\"9 Before concluding this volume, I shall examine into the importance of this last charge, more specious than solid, and which the author would hardly have stated in terms so peremptory and decided had he enjoyed the advantage of a longer residence in Turkey. At present I shall simply proceed to show how deeply the self-respect which M. Blanqui justly attributes to the religious senti ment has entered into the Turkish national character and habits. The poor man, even in receiving alms, esteems himself the equal of him who bestows it. This is not pride, as in the Spanish beggar who replied tothe hidalgo who reproved his idleness, \" Senor, I ask you for aid, not for advice ;\" it is obedience to the law of religion, to Islam ; for Islam means resignation to God. Thus both the beggar and the rich man are obeying the law, \u2014 the one in enduring his destiny, the other in succouring his brother. If the latter should \" pass by on the other side,\" which seldom happens, the poor man wonders, but does not murmur. He reflects, \u2014 \" If God had willed it so, I should be the rich man, and he the beggar.\" There is no more reason to be proud of good fortune, than to be humiliated by bad; for good and evil proceed equally 9 Blanqui, Voyage en B"], [77, "Letter III. 63 SPIRIT OF ISLAMISM. from the hand of God. Thus poverty, imperfection, phy sical deformity, excite neither the shame of the victim nor the contempt of others ; aud thus the infirm, idiots, and lunatics are objects of constant and general solicitude, and almost veneration, iu Turkey. The debasing senti ment of servile \"respect of persons\" is unknown to the Osmanli ; he acts constantly as though he were in the sight of God, and does not trouble himself about the opinion of men. It is in vain to seek in Turkey for a trace of those prejudices so common in European society. For instance, the punishment never outlives the expiation ; the consequences of an action remain with its author. The son of the condemned never blushes for his parent. On the contrary, he carves on his father's tomb the instru ment of his execution. In the great burial-ground of Pera, and in the Turkish cemeteries at Stamboul and Scutari, tombs may be seen on which are depicted men hanging, others undergoing decapitation, with an in scription recording the date and the reason of the catas trophe. This strange custom may be traced to two causes, one of which, the despotism which formerly too often inflicted on the guiltless the fate due only to the criminal, has happily ceased to exist ; the other still endures, though its influence is diminishing, \u2014 I mean the Kismet, or vague belief in predestination still existing among a majority of the Osmanlis. Such being the spirit of Islamism, the objection which was stated at the commencement of this chapter would seem to be answered.

But this rule is not always intelligible. The Koran is full of discordancies, contra dictions, and omissions.1 The mysticism affected by Mo hammed, the vagueness of his expressions, the language in which he writes, widely dissimilar from the common idiom of the present day, the extreme brevity with which his precepts are expressed, render it often difficult to penetrate the real meaning \u2014 the veil in which it has been perhaps designedly enveloped.

What criterion, what rule (oussoul) is there to rely on for the direction of the faithful ? Thus, as must necessarily occur in a doctrine which offered so wide a field for various interpretation,3 controversies early arose in the bosom of Islam : some resulting in schism, as that which produced the separation of the Sunnis and the Shiites ;4 others merely concerning the ritual, as those which separate the four orthodox sects (mezahib-erbea)7 And as all professed to act on i *\u2022* (in the Koran i ts (the foundation) of the Brjok, and others ichich are allegorical (Koran, iii. 5 ). ** The Sunnis, or orthodox believers, called also I. ,r men -n, that is to say, those who follow the traditional teaching, not only as to doctrine, but also as to the most important points of external practice, are thus called in opposition to the S) (the Sectarians), a name * bhe partisans of Ali, who regard the first Khalifs, Abou-bekir, Omar, and Osman, as intruders, and consider the legitimate right to the Khalifat to be vested in the descendants of Ali, to the exclusion of the two families of the id the Abassides. Tliis obstinate and unfortunate schism still causes the divisions between the Turks and the Persians. The be secession of the Shiites took place at the end ofthe fifteenth century : up to this time the Persians hovered between the two sects. But in the year 1499, Shah Ismail, the first prince of the Sefewi dynasty, proclaimed the Sltiite creed to be the national religion of since which, all attempts on either side to produce reunion have failed. 4 These sects are distinguished from each other by the name of the four imaums or teachers whom they recognize as their hea-ls, and who have been styled the four pillars of the Sunnite faith \u2014 A likih, and Hanbelih. Entirely agreed as to doctrines, the difference betw*een them rests solely on certain portions of the Liturgy, and may be compared to that which exists in the Catholic ' n the Roman, Syriac, and Armenian rituals, which possess no canonical distinction.

A century had scarcely elapsed since the death of Mohammed, yet his religion reigned tri umphant over more than half of the ancient world, and to the thirst of conquest united a zeal for civilization which would seem to have decayed since the Turk has superseded the Arab. This was the age of the four great imams Abou-Hanifeh, Schafiih, Malikih, and Hanbelih, whose four chapels are to be seen in the temple of Mecca ; then also arose on the banks of the Tigris, near the sites of the ancient Nineveh, Baalbec, and Palmyra, \u2014 Bagdad, the \"Wonderful City,\" the \" Houseof Safety\" (Dar-selam), the \" Bulwark of the Saints \" (Bourdjul-ewlia), which, by the beauty of its monuments, the splendour of the court of its Caliphs, the reputation of its schools attended by six thousand students and professors, the excellence of its poets, the renowned disputations of its theologians, seemed to have brought back the civilization of Greece and Italy to the Eastern source whence it originally flowed. Wherever the Musulman faith prevailed, there arose men who devoted themselves to the study of The Book which they considered to be the source of all know ledge and of all truth. They were called Ulemas (learned, 6 Mohammed styles himself the Illiterate Prophet. 7 The number of these commentaries ( Tefsev) is so considerable, that the titles of the works and the names of the authors would alone fill a large volume."], [82, "Letter IV. 68 LETTERS ON TURKEY. instructed;, to distinguish them from the mass of the people who still remained sunk in ignorance, and even could\" seldom read8 These students were, in the beginning, men of great simplicity of character, who had chosen their care* , from ambition than from love of learning, and who, as much by the excellence of their lives as by the exr their knowledge, acquired a great ascendancy over the minds of the faithful ; and people gradually acquired the habit of consulting them on all points of civil or religions difficulty, which were of frequent occurrence. Though Islamism, in its essence at least, is the most simple of all creeds, it prescribes a number of minute ob servances, not always clearly defined, but to which the Musulman seeks to adhere with scrupulous fidelity. The injunction to most of these duties is to be found in the sacred book, interspersed with its doctrines, and recorded with extreme brevity. For instance, in enjoining the Namaz or prayer, one of the five obligations of the Musulman creed, the Koran says, \" Recite the ? five times a day. In whatever place thou prayest, turn thy face towards the holy oratory (the temple of Mecca). O believers ! when you are about to pray, wash your face, and your hands unto the elbow;, dry your heads, and your feet unto the heels.\" 9 But what are the law ful hours determined by the Prophet 8 The art of reading even was then in the eyes of the vulgar so precious and extraordinary, that tl still bears testimony to this impression, the title , being equivalent to that of literate or learned man.

The Koran is silent on all such points. Hence believers found themselves compelled to apply for explanation to the Ulemas, and gradually came to regard them as the interpreters of the religious law, and in some degree as the dispensers of spiritual life ; hence also there arose in the minds of the Ulemas a tendency to exaggerate the external practices of religion, which they represented as equal, if not superior, in importance to the moral law, \u2014 a doctrine I y opposed to the design of their founder. I have recorded in another place the beautiful definition of goodness in the Koran. The Prophet is ever anxious to guard against laying too great a stress on external observ ances and worship. After indicating the proper attitude during the Namaz, he adds \" But the eyes of Him who sees all things are directed towards the religious disposi tions of the heart, and not to the position of the body.\" And nftei enjoining ablutions, he hastens to add, \" But 1 The five prayers are thus regulated: \u2014 Sabha namazi, the prayer of dawn, forty-five minutes before sunrise; Butte namazi, the prayer of midday, forty minutes after the sun has passed the meridian ; Hindi the third prayer, at the moment of the day which is exactly equidistant from midday and sunset; Ait h i, the fourth prayer, twenty minutes after sunset; i, the fifth prayer, about two hours after the preceding one.\u2014 Bianchi, Dictiort"], [84, "Letter IV. 70 LETTERS ON TURKEY. the most important of purifications is to cleanse the heart from ail stain.\" 2 Zoroaster said, \" He who plants a field of corn lays up a greater store of religious merit than he who repeats ten thousand prayers.\" The importance of the Ulema was further increased by the institution of marriage aud funeral ceremonies. Every Musulman has legally a right to perform these ceremonies ; but, like other acts appertaining to external worship, the mode of performance admitted of dispute, and consequently rendered it necessary to have recourse to the Ulemas. Their intervention speedily extended from religious observances to the different relations of social life, \u2014 religion and law being identical\u2014 an impor tant position in the state was thus opened to them. Still this interference of the Ulema in civil affairs was not a regular, legitimate, accepted fact, until the rashness of the Caliphs made it so, and thus placed in the hands of their adversaries a weapon against themselves. The Caliphs originally, like the High Priests of the Jewish Theocracy, were at the same time pontiffs, legis lators, and judges ; they administered justice in person, recited the public prayers on Fridays, and enforced the strict execution of the law, which was under their charge. Subsequently, when the ambition ofthe Caliphs extended to governing the world, the administration of temporal affairs aud the cares of the empire absorbed all their leisure ; and, neglecting what they considered as least 2 Purification, one of tlie most important observances of the Musul man ritual, is of three kinds: A perso i. purified by one or other of these three kinds of lustration, as well as by the purification by sand (teiemmum), receives the name of i"], [85, "Letter IV.

Somewhat analogous was the practice of European sovereigns, in the middle ages, of obtaining a bull of the Pope to authorise any great undertaking. The Caliphs, however, uniting in their own persons religious and political authority, could themselves confer the sanction they desired. This was the origin of the Fetvah, which plays so important a part in Ottoman history.

The^first among the Musulmans who gave an example of this voluntary poverty was the Caliph Ali \u2014 not from the motives which we have fre quently seen so powerful among Christians \u2014 anxiety to do penance for some great sin \u2014 but from a desire to fulfil literally the precept of the Koran, which declares \" That he is the best of men who is most useful to his fellow men.\" He soon had many followers ; they formed themselves into a society under the denomination of Safashabi, to indicate the purity of their manner of life and its con formity with the precepts of the Koran Gradually, how ever, the Safashabi began to yield to the erroneous but seductive belief, that a life passed in isolated contempla tion is peculiarly acceptable to the Deity. They substituted the delirium of religious extacy for the labours of active benevolence ; and withdrawing from the world, formed communities among themselves, where mystic reveries and a discipline renjarkable hy its austerity or its strange and fantastic absurdity became their sole occupations. Hence sprang the various orders of Dervishes, of which we shall make further mention presently, and which pre sent some resemblance to the monastic orders of the Romish Church. The doctrines of the Dervishes took their rise in the Sofiism, which existed in the East long before the time of Mohammed, and which perhaps might be traced back through the secret schools of the Pytha goreans and the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Alexandria, to the remotest theocracies of Egypt and India. We cannot avoid this conviction when we discover traces of the Greek as well as the Hindoo mind in the Arabian philosophy, though disguised by a strange"], [103, "Letter V. SOFIISM. 89 confusion of names, of dates, and even of doctrines. More than a century before Mohammed we find the two principal sects of Arabian philosophy, the Mes- uis (walkers), and the Ischrachaiouns (contempla tives), recalling hy the similarity of their names, and in measure of their doctrines, the two great philo sophic schools of Greece, represented by their illustrious chiefs, muallim evel Aristhathlis (the great master Aris totle), and Aflathoun elaki (the divine Plato). I must, however, confess that, though the .Arabian philosophers preserved religiously his epithet of divine, o Ssios Yl'kxraiv, he' is sadly travestied and mutilated at their hands, being no longer the sublime Greek thinker, seated amongst his disciples, and soaring to the highest practical truths of ethics and religion, but a Plato trun cated into Diogenes, doubled up in a tub, and placing the perfection of virtue in ahsolute inertness and the total extinction of our faculties. The almost simultaneous appearance of the Koran and of the works of the ancient philosophers, which were previously only known by tradition, formed a new \u00e6ra in the history of Arabian philosophy. The religious element was added to the rationalistic, which had -hitherto existed almost alone ; and their com bined influence, acting on the two primitive sects, intro duced two new systems, each coloured by their original tendency, the Meschaiouns melting into the Mutekelim (metaphysicians), and the Ischrachaiouns into the Sofis. The exact derivation of the term Sofi, has long been a matter of dispute. Some maintain that it comes from"], [104, "90 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter V. the Arabic adjective safi, applied to the society founded by Ali ; others, from safa, one of the stations surrounding the Kaaba, or from sqf (wool, or wool-wearing),2 in allu sion to the woollen garments adopted as a distinguishing mark by the new sect from other rival sects ; or it may proceed from the more natural and obvious Greek deriva tion of (Tocpo!. But this etymological problem less deserves examination than the nature and principles of Sofiism. The essence of the Sofi doctrine is neither more nor less than pantheism, defined in the following exclamation of Mewlana-Djeladeddin,3 addressing his spiritual master: \" ( ) my master ! you have completed my doctrinal in struction by teaching me that you are God, and that all is God.\" Whilst the philosophers of India and of Greece had rested satisfied with teaching, in a multitude of systems and of myths, the immortality of the soul, the emancipation of the Divine Intelligence, its abasement, its earthly lot, and its eventual reunion with its original source, the Sofis advanced some steps further, till they onlv saw emanations from the Divine Essence in all ma terial forms, comparing them to the sun's rays, which are continually darted forth and reabsorbed, thus applying to the whole creation the magnificent expression employed * This etymology is the most probable, and appears to be counte nanced by the following passage in the Pend-uameh, or book of counsels of Ferided-din: \"Cover thyself, like a sofi, with the tunic and ooi.\" - Mewlana-Djeladeddin, the greatest mystical poet of the East, founder of the order of the Afeiclevi Llervishes, was born in the year *304 of the Hegira (a.d. 1207), and di His principal work is the Mesnevi, a collection of which many of the verses have become proverbs."], [105, "Letter V.

This in fact is but to maintain the doctrine of the identity of God and of matter, which Spinoza at a later period undertook to demonstrate. Hence the necessity of a perpetual adoration of God in his works, inculcated by the Sofis in the term : \" Worship God in his creatures.' We have previously quoted a verse from the Koran, wherein it is written, \" It is not granted to man to hold 4 \" Quemadmodum radii solis eontingunt quidem terram, sed ibi sunt unde mittuntur ; sic animus magnus et sacer .... conversatur quidem nobiscum, sed h\u0153ret origini su\u00e6.\"\u2014 Sen.

Hence the express raising the vail still implies in Oriental language the closest intimacy with the Deity.5 It does not follow from this, however, that the Sofis, building on the foregoing text of the Ko an, and on another which says that \" God caused the creation io emanate from, and afterwards to return into, himself,\" r' aim at preserving the doctrines of Mohammed. Quite the reverse. These doctrines had perished in their hands. They did not deny the divine mission of the Prophet, but they twisted his precepts away by allegorical interpretations requiring a special unfolding. Even in the present day, the Wahabees, whom Sultan Mahmoud did not succeed in entirely destroy ing, and who are still scattered in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf, admit no other authority than the Koran interpreted by each man's reason, without any regard for the prophets or the Imaums. However dangerous the real tendency of their doctrines, the Sofis in the first instance disguised the peril by inculcating the most rigid morality. They were con stantly engaged in preaching concord, sobriety, and uni versal benevolence, and in giving examples of these virtues in their own practice. They maintained that evil only entered into the world through ignorance, which 5 Kasimirski, iron e Koran. e Koran, x.. 4."], [107, "I , tt. 1 \\ . 93 SOFIISM. they taught was the great cause of error and discoid amongst men, and which they illustrated hy the fol lowing story : \u2014 Four travellers \u2014 a Turk, an Arab, a Persian, and a Greek \u2014 happening to meet at a certain place, resolved to take their repast in common ; and, as none of them had more than ten paras, they consulted together as to what they should buy. \" Uzum,\" said the first : \" No,\" said the second ; \" Ineb.\" \" Ingkur\" rejoined the third, shaking his head. \" Srafilion,\" inter rupted the fourth.

But they gradually permeated and insinuated themselves into all the veins and arteries of the social body. Egypt, which had previously been the cradle of monachism, became the nursery of a new school of ascetics. Let us but substitute the name of Allah for that of Jesus, and we find an exact repetition of the same life, or rather a'1 of life, vit\u00e6 mori ac vivere morti, the same austerities and the same exaggerations. Mount Olympus, on the coast of Asia Minor, and almost facing Mount Athos, which was covered with innumerable Greek monasteries, was similarly peopled by thousands of these hermits of Islam, plunged in the contemplation of their own nature, and who are still revered as saints. Thence they passed into Arabia, Persia, and to the remotest extremity of India \u2014 as far as the Mohammedan religion extended. For a long time this enthusiasm, like that of the early Chris tians, only impelled men to bury themselves in deserts, and to shun the world and temporal affairs ; it neither stimulated them to seditious plots, nor to attempts against established authority. But when Sofiism passed from a doctrine to an institution, it assumed a political character. In the second century of the Hegira, about the year 129, Sheikh Olwan, a Sofi, highly esteemed for his virtue and his learning, founded the first religious order in Islam, and gave it his own name. This innovation encountered a great opposition on the part of the legistes and the orthodox followers of"], [109, "Letter V. 95 FIRST RELIGIOUS ORDERS.

But though this sentence, which became almost pro verbial, was received by all Musulmans as an article of faith, the tendency of the Arabs to a solitary and con templative life soon prevailed over orthodoxy. Other orders speedily arose in imitation of that of Sheikh Olwan. The number of these increased rapidly, espe cially from the second to the seventh century. Von Hammer reckons thirty-six of these orders, which he enumerates, following the estimate of D'Ohsson.7 Of this number twelve existed previously to the founding of the Ottoman empire ; the eighteen others arose between the fourteenth and the eighteenth centuries. It is not my purpose to enter into details relating to each of them, nor to p*j rticularise the ridiculous or revolt ing practices to which they resort in order to impose on the multitude. Every oue has heard of the Mewlevi Dervishes of Pera, who revolve several hours consecu tively, with their arms extended before them, their head slightly leaning on their shoulder, their eyes half closed, accompanied by a soft and measured cadence of flutes ; and of the Howling Dervishes of Scutari, who sway them- to the right and left with a velocity which becomes frenzy, holding a red-hot iron between their teeth, until they fall prostrate, bathed in sweat, their mouth foaming, and their eyes starting from their sockets.

The object that specially claims our attention, after pointing out these facts, is to display the source as well as the nature of the almost universal influence exercised by the Dervishes in the present day in Turkey, and which no attempt has hitherto succeeded in eradicating. Sofiism, like all other mystic systems, embraced two doctrines \u2014 the one public, for the multitude ; the other secret, and reserved for adepts. A strict observance of religion and of all social virtues was required in the can- didate for initiation ; but after a long series of trials and of mortifications were supposed to have elevated him to the degree requisite for seeing truth face to face, the veil hitherto extended before his sight was withdrawn. He was taught that, under au allegorical disguise, the Koran presented only political maxims, that it was but a dead letter until it received vitality by interpretation, and that to him who had once attained to the height of spiritual abstraction and devotion, all external forms and ceremo- nies were vain and useless. \" When you are outside the Kaaba\" (the Kaaba, in the allegorical language of the Dervishes, implies the Divine Love), \" it is good to direct your looks towards it ; but if a man is once within it, it does not matter in what direction he turns.\" Such are the expressions used by Djeladeddin in his Mesnevi."], [111, "Letter V. THE MESNEVI. 97 The whole passage is, however, too remarkable to be abridged : \u2014 \"Moses met a shepherd, who, in the fervour of his soul, addressed God, saying, ' O my Master, my Lord ; where art Thou, that I may be Thy servant ; that I may sew Thy slippers, that I may comb and clean Thy hair, that I may wash Thy robe, that I may offer the milk of my goats to Thee whom I worship ? Where art Thou, that I may kiss Thy beautiful hand, that I may rub Thy beautiful feet, that I may sweep Thy chamber before Thou sleepest ?' e Thus spoke the shepherd. Moses, inflamed by zeal for the religion which he was sent by God to preach, reproved the man for his blasphemies, assured him that God has no body, that he has no need of clothing, of food, of chambers ; in short, told him that he was an infidel. The shepherd, whose intellect could not rise to the conception of a being that had not a body like himself, and that was not subject to the same neces sities, and stunned hy the reproaches of the messenger of God, gave himself up to despair, and renounced all worship. Then God addressed Moses, saying, ' Thou hast removed my servant from me. I sent thee to draw men nigh, and not to alienate them.

The lovers of God are the people of no other master save God.\" In this manner orthodox doctrine and the foundation of morality were both undermined : one principle alone remained, and marked the union of religious enthu siasm with priestly imposture ; this was absolute 9 Mesnevi, ch. ii.

I have already mentioned the invocation of the founder of the Mewlevis (who was also regarded by the Dervishes in general as one of the greatest authorities in spiritual life) : \" O my Master ! you have finished my instruction by teaching me that you are God, and that everything is God.\" As early as four centuries before this time, Bajezid of Bestaini, the founder of the Bcstamis, had exclaimed in the presence of his disciples, alluding to his own person, \" Glory to myself; I am above everything /\" a mode of expression which in. the language of Orientals is applied to the Deitv alone. By degrees the worship of their master superseded, among the Dervishes, the worship of God ; the aim of life was no longer directed to an intimate union of the soul with its Creator, but to an absolute conformity with the thoughts of the Sheikh. \" Whatever you do or think, let your Sheikh be always present, to your mind.\" Such is the first and almost the only obli gation imposed on the Dervish, and expressed by a kind of mental prayer named rabouta, which these fanatics are as scrupulous in repeating as other Musulmans their Namaz. These doctrines produced their fruits in a host of half religious, half-political devotees, who styled themselves, according to places and circumstances, the red, the white, the masked (borkai), the familiars (batheni), the allego rists or interpreters (mutervii), Karmathians, Ismailians. &c, whose traces in the second to the seventh centuries of the Hegira are marked by blood and ruin.

The most renowned were the Ismailians or Assassins, who originally came from Persia, and a few of whom still remain in the mountains above Tripoli and Tortosa.1 Persia was in fact the stronghold of Dervishism, either from the leaning to mysticism natural to its people, or the Shiite doctrine, which teaches tbe belief in a hidden Imaum, whose appearance, like that of the Messiah of the Jews, is always expected, both these circumstances contributing to favour the ambition and the impostures of sectaries. We must also bear in mind the influence of the splendid names of Saadi and Hafiz, and of most of the great poets of Persia, who were either Dervishes, or affi liated with some of these orders, and whose books are esteemed among the first as authorities in spiritual mat ters. Their works, it is true, represent the philosophical rather than the political phase of Dervishism ; they often write like mystic dreamers and singular moralists, and sometimes like inspired bards, but never as ambitious sectaries or hypocritical reformers.

Nothing of this nature, not even the invocation to Venus in Lucretius, comes up to the passage of the Mesnevi in which the poet shows us, in his soft Persian idiom, the whole creation filled with the divine love, by which even the most humble plant is excited to seek the sublime object of its desires. The favourite reveries of the Persian poets are on the following heads : \u2014 -The worship of the creature disguised as the worship of God : terrestrial love, regarded as \" the bridge over which all those must pass who seek the beatitude of divine love ;\" and the apotheosis of matter represented as the glorification of the soul. These poets, however, belong rather to the Sofis than the Dervishes : and the majority of them are for the most part careful to inculcate the purity and sincerity of religious doctrine.

But how is it possible to express in human language what transcends humanity? The words that we employ are only capable of explaining what relates to our material and gross ideas. The man who has been exalted to ecstacy retains no remembrance of it when restored to his ordinary condition and once more become coirfmon mortal. The poet expresses this idea by an allegory : \" A Der vish being questioned in a tone of ridicule by his com rades, what wonderful gift he brought back with him from that garden of delights whence he was just issued, he replied, ' I proposed, when I had reached this rose tree (the sight of God), to fill the skirt of my robe with roses, that I might bring them back to my brethren ; but when I drew nigh to it, I was so intoxicated by the per fume of the rose, that the hem of my garment escaped my grasp. The tongue of him who has known God cleaves to the roof of his mouth.' ' So great was the favour enjoyed by the Dervishes in Persia, that one of them, Shah Ismail Sefervi, who gave out that he was descended from Mousa, the seventh revealed Imaum, was raised to the throne in the tenth century of the Hegira (1501), and founded the dynasty of princes known in Europe by the name of Sophis. The Ottoman Sultans, however, and their predecessors, the Caliphs, had at an early period adopted measures to oppose the influence of Dervishism ; they were justly alarmed at its progress, and spared no attempts to extin guish it. The Ulema likewise bestirred themselves to resist its progress, ostensibly to defend Musulman ortho-"], [117, "Letter V.

It sometimes happened even that the people joined the hostile movement, owing to the deeply-rooted antipathy harboured by the Sunnites against the Shiites. This threefold antagonism \u2014 of political authority \u2014 of the Ulema, and of popular feeling \u2014 presents the struggle under three different aspects. The political authority acted without circumlocution and by simple force ; as, for instance, in the attempt made in 1G56, under the Grand Vizir, Mohammed Koupruli, to annihilate the Mevlevi, Khalweti, Djelveti, and Chemsi Dervishes. But, generally speaking, these attempts have not succeeded, and have only served to display more plainly the feebleness of the government and the steadily increasing ascendancy of the religious orders. It was evident that the government was timid ; its very violence was a proof of weakness and embarrassment ; it dreaded sedition, and was especially in awe of the Janis saries, who. were united by a feeling of brotherhood with the Dervishes, especially with the Bektachis.3 s This fraternization dates as far back as the foundation of these Musulman Pr\u00e6torians When the second Sultan of the Ottomans created the Jenitcheri (new troops), a name corrupted by Europeans into \"Janissaries,\" he wished to consecrate the institution, following the same political maxim which had caused the Caliphs to give authority to their decrees by the fetvah of a Mufti.

The opposition of the Ulema was more peaceful in form, but more hostile, constant, and systematic in fact. And this was natural, for in their case there was not only a rivalry of interests, but also of doctrines ; ambi tion, pride, fanaticism, self-love \u2014 all the passions of human nature were brought into play. As the Ulema were not able to attack the substance itself of the Dervish doctrines whilst these remained secret, they proceeded in the name of the Koran and the Sunnah to attack, as contrary to the spirit and letter of Islamism, the practices that formed the basis of their institution, namely, abstinence, religious vows, the music. and dances in use in the tekiehs, the pretended gift of miracles and of direct communication with God claimed by the Sheikhs. They recalled the example of the first disciples of the Prophet ; \u2014 Osman, Ali, and Abdu- Rahman \u2014 who having made each a vow, the first not to approach his wife, Esmeh, from one sunrise to the fol lowing ; the second not to sleep till dawn ; aud the third to abstain from food for twenty-four hours ; the Prophet reprimanded them hy a celebrated Hadis.

REACTION OF THE ULEMA. The pervading idea of the Institution appeared in fact to be a design of introducing into Islam something analogous to the \" Christian priesthood \" and \" Divine Church.\" It is asserted that such a design is clearly manifested by the term \" Living God,\" which forms one of the seven articles of the Dervish confession of faith.4 A much worse discovery was that they concluded some of their prayers by anathematizing the Ommiad Caliphs, and glorifying Ah. Henceforward their adversaries considered themselves at liberty to accuse them of every crime, \u2014 of tampering with doctrine, of practising all sorts of orgies in their tekiehs, of blaspheming the Koran, of denying the very existence of God, of preaching sedition against all esta blished authorities, and of trampling under foot all Divine and human laws. The opposition of the people to Dervishism arose from their* attachment, to the Sunnite orthodoxy, and their horror of the Shiite heretics, whose doctrines they con founded with those of the Dervishes. This opposition, however, has neither been steady nor general. Its usual weapon has been ridicule.

Sultan Mahmoud struck the first blow at them by the destruction of the Janissaries. But this was only the prelude to a more direct attack on themselves.

This hold stroke stunned the Dervishes. For a mo ment they believed that all their orders would be imme diately dispersed, and they remained motionless, expect ing their last day, devoured by anguish, and with their backs resting against the wall of stupes action.

Very lately a Dervish of Bokhara (you are aware that they exceed all others in fanaticism) presented himself to the audience of Beschid Pasha, and there, publicly and before the whole Porte, he loaded the minister with insults and threats, styling him a dog, an infidel, and a miscreant, and calling down the thunders of heaven and the daggers of all true Musulmans to smite him.

The Caliphate was virtually destroyed by the Tartar conquest and the fall of the metropolis of Islam, but the title was yet preserved three centuries by the eighteen .idants of Moustanser-Billah, the son or reputed son 1 The dynasty of the Ommiades numbers fourteen princes, whose names are mentioned in the following extract from the History of Persia by the former secretary of Futee-Ali-Shah, father of the present Shah: \" There were fourteen Beni-Ummeiieh who reigned over the world: the first was Moawyah, son of the ungrateful Inth; to him suc ceeded the tyrant Yesid; then Moawyah, Merwan, Abdul -Melik, Velid, Solyman, Omar, Yesid, Haehem, Velid, and again Yesid, Ibrahim the Wicked, and lastly Merwan the Ass ; and he was the last of the fourteen asses.\" 1 The influence of the Abassides over the Musulman world was main- vith lustre until the time of the twentieth Caliph Rhadi, ' * the last Caliph, according to Abulfeda, who harangued the people from his throne, who passed his leisure hours with scholars and men of taste, whose treasures and expenditure, whose table and magnificence, had some resemblance with those of the ancient Caliphs.\" After this epoch the Abassides fell into a state of degradation and imbecility which recalls the period of the Faineant kings of the Merovingian race."], [130, "116 Letter VI.

These princes, having withdrawn into Egypt, continued the dig nity and title of Caliph until the year 1517, without, however, retaining the slightest vestige of temporal sovereignty. About this period the Sultan Selim I. conquered Egypt, and, having taken Mohammed XII., the last of the Abas side family, prisoner, compelled him to sign a formal renunciation of the rights and insignia of the Caliphate, including the standard, the sword, and the mantle of the Prophet. The cession was confirmed the following year by the transfer of the keys of the temple of Mecca to the Sultan, Sherriff Mohammed Aboul-Berekiat.3 The Shiites, however, only recognise the twelve Imaums as Caliphs, of whom Ali was the chief and the founder, and of whom the twelfth and last, Mohammed-ben- Hassan, disappeared in a grotto near Hella, at the age of twelve years, in the year 160 of the Hegira (873), thus terminating the series of revealed Imaums. This Imaum the Persians believe to be living invisible within the grotto until the end of the world, when he will re appear under the name of Mehdi (Guide or Leader). These are the differences held by the two great, nations of Islam as to the transmission of the Caliphate. We will now trace their origin and character.

CONTEST FOR THE CALIPHATE. 117 is utterly silent on the order of the succession to the throne. Mahommed died, like Alexander the Great, without naming his successor, leaving to his disciples \u2014 that is to the nation \u2014 the care of choosing the most worthy. \" My disciples assembled together will not he able to make a bad choice,\" said he, according to a hadis of the Sun nites, in which it has been pretended that traces of the doctrine of the infallibility of the church are to be found, and which Mahommed is reproached with having hor rowed from the Christians. This speech of the Pro phet's, joined to the silence of the Koran on a subject of such importance, seems to leave no doubt as to the idea of the founder of Islam. We may presume that, if he had desired to establish the Caliphate on an here ditary principle, he would have appointed as his successor Ali, the husband of his daughter Fatima, the first and most beloved of his disciples. But, although Mahommed possessed only an imperfect, acquaintance with the anterior events of history, it had not escaped his natural perspi cuity (aided as it was by his intercourse with foreign merchants whom he had known during his travels), that, in the successive development of the history of the world, nothing is permanent, all human institutions require modi fying, and it rarely happens that one age inherits the spirit of the preceding one. Notwithstanding the general formula found at almost every step in the Koran, that \" Supreme power belongs to God, who giveth and taketh it away at his pleasure,\" Mahommed's real conviction was, that supreme authority belongs to the wisest or the bravest in successive ages, de jure, and doubtless also de"], [132, "118 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Lett-r Yl. facto ; for he was so far a fatalist that he believed the career of superior intellects is marked out beforehand. For this reason, in spite of his predilection for Ali whom he made the depositary of his most secret thoughts, he preferred leaving the choice of his successor to the suf- frages of the nation, regarding the elective principle as best adapted to assure the progress and development of Islamism, through the wide field it opens to valour and individual qualifications. If the talents and virtues of Ali destined him to the throne, he would surely attain it when the hour arrived. The succession of Mahommed may be said to have been contested even before his death. Extended on the ground, his head resting on the bosom of his wife Ayesha, the clamour of the disputants disturbed his dying mo ments ; indignation gave him strength to raise himself, and, in a terrible voice, he commanded them to retire, and not disturb with their quarrels the last moments of the messenger of God ; but no sooner had he ceased to breathe than the contest recommenced with renewed vio lence. His original disciples, who had emigrated with him from Mecca, and the people of Medina, with whom he had found an asylum, and who ever after had aided him in his enterprises,4 maintained with equal energy the pretensions of their respective towns to nominate a chief for the nation. The choice of the nation directed by Omar at length fell upon Abou-Bekir, father-in-law of the Prophet, whom Mahommed on his dying bed, finding * The former were called Mohadjirs, from hedjare, flight \u2014 the latter were called .insars, from nasr, to succour."], [133, "119 Letter VI.

Abou-Bekir assumed the title of Caliph Vicar (or rather Successor 5) of the Prophet of God, Khalifi y reqoul Allah, which he had already borne on several occasions, even during the lifetime of Mahommed, when the latter, on becoming master of Medina, the centre of his rising power, and the first seat of the Caliphate, con fided to him during his absence the defence and govern ment of this metropolis. Neither the title nor the functions of the Caliph were new in Islam, and they indicated, after Mahommed's death, as before, a sort of Lieutenant-Generalcy, and no way implying the continuation of the authority of the Prophet himself. To define in a still more formal manner the purely temporal authority of the Caliphate, Omar subsequently substituted for the title of Caliph that of Prince or Commander of the Faithful, Emir-ul muslimin, which was borne by all succeeding Caliphs. The accession of Omar, whom Abou-Bekir designated on his death-bed as his successor, without the appoint ment being confirmed by the people, was the first viola tion of the principle of universal suffrage, which Omar endeavoured, partially at least, to re-establish. When he was carried back to his tent, mortally wounded by the hand of an assassin, he assembled around him the Ashabs (the appellation given to the companions of the Prophet and of the first Caliphs), and expressed his reluctance to take upon himself the appointment of a successor. \"It 5 From the verb chalef, to follow, come after.

The murder of Osman (654) led to the election of Ali, which was soon after followed by the assassination of the latter, in the year 40 of the Hegira (661), and the massacre of his two sons, Hassan and Hussein. Thus was verified the prophecy of Mahommed, \" The Caliphate will endure thirty years after me ; when this period shall have elapsed, there will be only powers esta blished by force, usurpation, and tyranny.\" 7 From the reign of the usurper Moawyeh (who esta blished the law of primogeniture in favour of his family), the dignity of the Caliphate became hereditary in the a I have already had occasion to speak of the horror which the parti sans of Ali profess for the three first Caliphs, wham they regard as intruders.

There is no doubt but Mahommed understood by Caliphate a legitimate succession ; yet, if we suppose something else is implied by it, viz. the spiritual power which some desire to see established in Islam, it follows from this that the priesthood of the Caliphate, if there ever were such a thing, ceased to exist thirty years after the death of Mahommed: it is impossible to avoid this inference."], [135, "Letter VI.

But this very fact deprived the Caliphate in the eyes of the people of a great part of the authority it enjoyed in the hands of the four first succes sors of Mahommed, on whom it was conferred by the free and unanimous voice of the Ashabs. Hence has arisen the distinction between the perfect Caliphate of the first, and the imperfect of the second. Such is the origin of the Caliphate. It will be evident that it involves neither absolute sovereignty, divine right, nor spiritual power. In fact, spiritual power in Islam begins and ends with Mahommed. On the contrary, we discover that which is found in the cradle of all society \u2014 equality of rights between all the members of the body politic, and the voluntary and conditional obedience of the nation to the sovereign chosen by itself. The Sultan, Imaum, or Caliph, whichever be the title he assumes, is consequently neither the successor nor the representative of the Prophet, as is so frequently asserted. The idea of a spiritual succession was never entertained even by the four first Caliphs. So much the reverse, that when Abou-Bekir, after the death of Mahommed, used to recite the public prayers in the mosque, he refrained from ascend ing the pulpit, as had been the custom of the \" Celestial Messenger,\" and remained one step below. Omar, after him, rested on a still lower step ; and Osman surpassed Omar in humility.8 6 The Ottoman Empire, its Nations and its Dynasty. By M. Chauvm- Beillard. Paris, 1845. VOL. I.

The institution of the Salic law is not found in the Koran, but is contained in the Code, in accordance with the words of the Prophet, \" There can be neither felicity nor salvation for a people governed by a woman.\" There is this peculiarity, however, in the law of Ottoman suc cession, \u2014 that the sceptre, instead of descending from father to son, devolves on the eldest surviving male of the imperial family, who may perhaps be a brother, uncle, or even cousin, of the deceased sovereign. This law, instituted to avert the dangers of a minority, has, with one or two exceptions, been strictly adhered to by the present dynasty. In default, of male heirs of the present line, the Sultan must be chosen from the family of the ancient Khans of the Crimea, who are descended from the same stock. It is impossible to calculate the political consequences of such an event, should it ever occur ; it is not unlikely that the extinction of the Osman dynasty would be fol lowed by the immediate dissolution of the empire. Such is the charter of the Caliphate, as it is found in the Koran and the Code ; but in neither is any mention made of \"Divine right\" as the foundation of its prero gatives and duties.

The Sovereign in Islam commands the army, distributes justice, imposes taxes, watches over the different branches of the administration ; and he enjoys all the prerogatives that belong to the executive power in constitutional states. But that is all. It is true that he exercises his attributes singly and alone, without the aid of any ministers responsible to the nation ; but this is the only absolute, or rather exclusive, phase of his authority, and the only one that can give an opening to the abuse of power. In addition, the law which he is bound to see executed, being reduced to a small number of regular formulas, without any details relative to the form or mode of government, leaves the Sovereign a much greater lati- tude, in this respect, than is enjoyed by the chief of a repre- sentative government, who reigns by virtue of a contract in which the reciprocal privileges aud duties of the ruler and of his subjects, as well as the powers of the various authorities, have been precisely defined. But, apart from this, the Sovereign, in Turkey, has not even the privilege of inviolability, which most modern charters secure to the person of the monarch.

His tory shows us that this is not a vain theory. Of seventy two legitimate Caliphs from Abou-Bekir to Mohammed XII. at least one-third were put to death or imprisoned. Of the Ottoman Sultans only two have been put to death, but several have been deposed or imprisoned for life. The legislative authority, correctly speaking, resides in the law itself, Cher'iat, which is supposed to have regulated everything. If, however, unforeseen circum stances arise which render it important for the national welfare to enact a new measure, the Sovereign is em powered to promulgate de motu proprio, but at the same time with the advice and sanction of his privy council, decrees having, throughout the empire, the force of laws. as soon as they have been sanctioned by the formalities already mentioned. The decree or constitution of Gul haneh was of this nature. This prerogative of the Sovereign is styled Ours (good pleasure), and the laws it promulgates Kanoun.* These Kanouns, drawn up in Turkish, whilst the text of the Cher'iat is in Arabic, are not considered as organic laws, but merely as administrative regulations, which, ema nating from a human source, may be modified or abro gated according to circumstances. Of this nature are the Kanouns which Sultan Solyman, on whom the Turks have bestowed the epithet of El-Kanouni (the lawgiver), promulgated under the appellation of Km They relate to the proceedings before the tribunals, to the ser vice and discipline of the army, to the government, 4 See the following letter."], [141, "Letter VI.

The Oars can maintain or abolish, at will, the regu lations of the Kanoun, but it cannot under any circum stances take the place of the Cher'iat, which enjoys an authority paramount to every other. The Turks have an admirable phrase to express this idea ; they say, \" Kheri atin kesdcgui parmak adjimaz ;' \" the finger cut by the Cher'iat feels no pain.\" It follows from the foregoing considerations that the government in Turkey has more affinity to the monarchy defined by Montesquieu as the \" government of one man, bv fixed and established laws,\" than to what that author and most persons understand by a despotism, namely, a government in which one man rules, independent of law and limitation, according to his own will and pleasure. Not only does law exist in Turkey, but it is the supreme and sole authority. The Sovereign rules through it and in its name : and the power he wields is conferred upon \u25a0ot to be used according to his caprice, but that he may quard the interests of the community, whereof he is the delegate.' \" The fact of his being a delegate,\" observes M. Du Caurroy, \" implies that he is invested with a dis cretionary power to adopt all preventive and repressive measures, adapted to secure the public safety, but he is not invested with the power of departing from the law of the Koran. The obedience which the Book enjoins upon all believers does not extend to commands contrary to its precepts, and those of the Cheriat. \" Let the faithful J Multeka code; of the Sieri Kebir, or right of var."], [142, "Letter VI. 128 LETTERS ON TURKEY. obey God ; obey the Prophet, and those amongst you who are clothed with authority.\" e Such is the text of the Koran, to which Beidhawi adds the following com mentary: \"But as respects authorities subsequei t to the Prophet, such as cadis, caliphs, the commanders of armies, obedience is only due to them in so far as they shall remain in the right path.\" This distinction has become an axiom of political law, not only in Turkey, but even in Persia, where the prin ciple of Divine right ha;-* a much stronger hold. \" Every power,\" says the poet Saadi, \" is of necessity com manded by the power from which it emanates ; the Cadi obeys the Vizir who appointed him, the Vizir obeys the Sultan, from whom he holds his dignity, and the Sultan obeys the law, through which he obtains the obedience of the people.\" Thus the sovereign in Turkey is only the first servant of the law, and his whole attributes consist in preventing its violation hy auy one, himself included. Nor is this duty limited to the sovereign alone ; the celebrated maxim uttered by the Prophet himself \u2014 \" Nehi an in rnunhher,\" \" Oppose the violation of the law,\" \u2014 confers the same right on the meanest of his subjects, and places the law, or (as we may term it) the constitution, in Turkey, under the individual protection of every one of her citizens. It may perhaps be objected \" that this inquiry is beside the purpose, and that nothing is proved by showing that the spirit of the original constitution does not counte- 6 Koran, iv. 61."], [143, "Letter VI. 129 AUTHORITY OF THE SOVEREIGN. nance despotism in the sovereign.\" Despotism is almost always an afterthought. The hereditary and absolute power of Louis XIV. began as an elective and precarious monarchy under Pharamond and his successors. Grant ing that the doctrines of the \" religion and law of Islam agree in only acknowledging a restricted and purely tem poral authority in the sovereign, has this prevented the Caliphs or the Sultans from ruling as despots? What you advance, though true in theory, is false in fact ; and the murders, imprisonments, confiscations, and arbitrary taxes which history records, display the sovereign as the absolute master of the lives and property of his subjects.\" Even these objections present an important fact, to which it is essential to call attention. The murders, imprisonings, and confiscations which are here alluded to, were inflicted on Vizirs, Pashas, officers of the Seraglio, and either Ulemas, ministers of the Sultan, or agents of his authority ; they rarely reached private individuals, or even Kai as.7 The power of the Sultan over his ministers was that of a master over his slaves, and gave him the right to dispose of their life and property at his option, whilst his other subjects could only be condemned by the tribunals, and according to the laws. The distinction originated in the practice which long prevailed with the Sultans, of selecting their vizirs from 7 According to an ancient custom, a part of the property of the grandees of the empire and other functionaries of the Porte, condemned to death, accrued by reversion to the Crown.

Doubtless this principle, acknowledged by Mon tesquieu, which established that whilst the people should be judged by the laws, the great should be at the mercy of the prince, has not been always rigidly observed The Penal Code of 1840, which I shall speak of in the next Letter, contains valuable admissions on this score. But the principle has remained unchanged ; and though the usurpations of power may have gone great lengths, the doctrine of equality before the law has maintained its place not only in the traditions, but mainly also in the practice of the country. At the present time the Sultan, who receives a fixed civil list of 13,000 purses (57,500/.) per month, has no property of his own ; even his private treasury, though quite distinct from that of the State, and composed of sums amassed and precious objects left by his predeces sors, bears the name of Beit-il-mal ul Mmlimim (the Administration of the property of Musulmans). If called to give testimony before a Cadi, he must remain standing, or, should he infringe the custom by seating himself, the other witnesses have likewise a right to be seated. An instance is recorded of a Grand Mufti, Mewla-Fenari, who refused to receive the deposition of Sultan Amu rath I. because the law rejected the testimony of every Musulman who neglected to attend public prayers on a Friday.

But to quit the past, and revert to the present, or rather the future, which promises a new era for Turkey, let us bear in mind that Turkey is essentially the country of tradition, where nothing can be established or endure unless it offer a point of contact with what has gone before ; that in the Ottoman empire it is necessary to build upon the law in order to modify the law ; and we shall perceive that the study of the past is absolutely necessary for a proper comprehension of the present In Turkey, political or social, reform is only possible by its being based on the Koran and on Tradition. At first sight the terms \" constitutional monarchy \" and \" republic \" seem, to the Osmanli, words devoid of sense, so deeply rooted in his mind is the notion of Unity in power. His motto is, \" Kathamde bir tchen guerek,\" \" A file of camels requires only one bell.\" Even if you endeavour to explain to him the maxim that \" the King reigns but does not govern,\" he will regard your distinc- tion as impious, and injurious to his Padishah, whom he still continues to style Zilullah, or The Shadow of God. But go a step farther. Prove to him, by the Koran and the Hadis, by the example of the four first Caliphs, and by the testimony derived from his own history, that government as established by Mahommed is actually one in which the sovereign only reigns, whilst the law governs, and he will agree not only that such a government is the best, but the only one that men ought to submit to, and he will heartily concur and lend his assistance in the reforms you suggest, not because they are innovations,"], [146, "132 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

He will be the more inclined to do this if he sees the head of the state take the initiative, and especially if, instead of a doubtful result, as with the reforms of Sultan Mah moud, he beholds the work crowned with success ; for the Osmanli always considers success as the sentence of God. And, in point of fact, what does this work of reform amount to ? It seeks to establish that as the law which has existed from time immemorial in the traditions, cus toms, and manners of the nation, and to convert into a fact what has hitherto been generally a vague formula or a fortuitous accident. If we look back to the fundamental principles of constitutional states, whether monarchies or republics, we shall find that they are almost all contained in the Musulman law, or may be logically deduced from it The Musulman law formally sets forth the sovereignty of the nation, universal suffrage, the prin ciple of election extended to all, even to the wovernino* power, equality between all members of the body politic, the interdiction of monopoly aud state privileges. The other principles we have alluded to are implied in it in the same way that conclusions are contained in premises. At the same time I would caution the reader that I do not mean to imply that a constitutional system is on the point of being established in Turkey, nor do I see very clearly what Turkey would gain by it.

The Koran, whicli, notwithstanding important omis sions, contains regulations tolerably precise concerning paternal authority, wills, successions, contracts, &c. 2. The Suuna or Tradition, formed by collecting the Hadis, and all relating to the language, precepts, and oral laws of the Prophet, to his acts, observances, and even the silence 2 that he has maintained in connection with various actions, which have accordingly become either lawful or matters of indifference, such, for example, as the use of tobacco, of opium, &c. Although con sidered Divinely inspired, the Hadis are not obligatory in the same sense as the Koran. They are not all equally proved, and consequently have not the same theological value. They form six collections or books, called the six revered boohs. 8 \"His silence, like that of women, was full of eloquence; his eyes conveyed dumb messages.\" \u2014 Boukhari, Collection of Oral Traditions."], [150, "136 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

This successive derivation of authorities from the Pro phet, from the immediate companions of the Prophet, and from the Fathers of the Islamite Church (as we may style the four first Caliphs), marks three distinct periods, subsequent to the Koran, in the formation of Musulman jurisprudence. It is related by the historian El-Machrisi that \u2014 \" After our Prophet Mahommed, who was sent by God to reveal his will to all mankind, had departed from Mecca to Medina, he was accompanied by the Ashabs, 4 who would not leave him, though they often found themselves in the greatest distress for want of money and food.

Now, whenever a question was laid before him, or that he pronounced a decision commanding or forbidding certain things, the Ashabs heard and published it amongst the people.\" Thus it was that the Sunna originated. Several of the Ashabs, especially Abou-Bekir, Omar, Osman, Ali, Abd-u-Rahman, Selman, and others, deli vered Fetvahs even during the lifetime of the Prophet. On the death of Mahommed, and the accession of Abou- Bekir to the Caliphate, the Ashabs separated, some de parting into Syria and Irak,5 others remaining with the Caliph at Medina \" Now, if questions arose requiring a decision, Abou-Bekir pronounced judgment according to his knowledge of the Koran and the Sunna ; if he knew not any sentence in them that solved the case, he consulted the Ashabs who had remained with him ; if they could point out one, he based his decision thereon ; if they could not, he interpreted and pronounced sen tence according to his own judgment.\" From this legal interpretation, called Idjtihad, is de rived Idjma-y-umrnet, literally the consent of the nation. The Idjtihad is an opinion on religious matters, founded on reasoning and a comparison of the Koran with tra dition ; and all these opinions having been determined and fixed in the code Multequa, the modern legists are in the habit of saying, \" Idjtihad kapongou kapandy \" (the door of interpretation is closed).6 5 Persia. \u2022 Bianchi's Dictionary, at the word Idjtihad."], [152, "138 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

Three centuries elapsed between the treatises of the four great orthodox Imaums and the publication of the Akaidoun of Nesefi, whose system still forms the basis of the doctrine of the Sunnites. The orthodox Musulman dogmas were not permanently fixed till towards the middle of the sixth century ; the law was not finally settled till a much later date. In fact, no fewer than two hundred lawyers, including the four great Imaums, have devoted their whole lives to raise the structure of Musul man legislation on a foundation specious rather than solid.

The political code. The military code. The game laws. The civil and criminal code. The penal code. The commercial code. The civil code. The Religious Code. This Code consists of many books, in which, after a general outline of religious doctrine, the most essential obligations of religious worship and of moral conduct are set forth. The duties first insisted on are those comprised in the term Farz,' five in number, embracing purifications, prayer, almsgiving, fastings, and pilgrimages. The farz 8 The term Etirz, which does not admit of literal translation, signifies the various precepts which are derived either from the Koran itself or from the Cher'-iat (religious law).

In short, though great sanctity attaches to the Cher'iat in general, its separate departments are regarded with very various degrees of respect, in proportion as they are supposed to flow from uninspired men, from the Prophet, or from God. The second matter that occurs in the religious code relates specially to moral conduct ; and this portion of the work forms four books, which treat of labour (kesb). Of the moral virtues, such as charity, honesty, modesty, the interdiction of gaming, the observance of oaths, &c. Of dress (lubs). Of food and drink (attime, churbe), the nature and conditions whereof are scrupulously deter mined by the law. The Koran in fact expressly declares \" You are forbidden to eat the flesh of dead animals, or of swine, or to use as food any animal over whom any other name than that of God has been invoked in slaugh tering it.\" ' The Mohammedan doctors have included and birds of prey under this interdict. All amphi bious animals are regarded with horror, as well as the ass and the mule. Hares are neutral animals. The provisions of the Mahometan law to ensure the slaughter ing of animals in the least painful manner, afford a striking instance of the compassionate spirit of the law giver. In the Koran, Mahommed likewise forbids the use of wine;2 but adds subsequently: \"Those who be- 1 Koran, ii. 168, and v. 4. 8 Koran, ii.

The Political Code, divided into four books, treats of the rights and duties of the sovereign, as well as of the conditions of his sovereignty, of the financial laws, and of those that concern tributary subjects and foreigners. The Military Code. The Military Code forms a book entitled Sier, a word signifying, in general, the course to be pursued, and in law, more particularly, meaning the course to be followed by Musulmans in their relations with infidels and with rebellious Musulmans (Bougdi). I shall give only a brief summary of this book, refer ring the reader for more ample information to au excel lent article by M. du Caurroy, in the Asiatic Journal? The Koran divides the earth into two partitions : the country or the house of Islam (Dar-ul- Islam), and the country or the house of the enemy or of war (Dar-ul- * Journal Asiatique (Asiatic Journal;, Feb. \u2014 March, 1851."], [157, "MILITARY CODE. 143 harb). The latter consists of territories subject to the authority and laws of infidels, whether infidels by birth (Kafir), or apostates (Masted). Both classes are de scribed by the common term, Harbi. Hence arises the state of permanent and constant hos tility between the Musulmans and the Harbis. This is the holy war (Djihad), founded on the verse of the Koran, quoted by Beidhawi in his commentary : \" Fight them till all unbelief is destroyed, and all religion is devoted to the true God alone.\" There are other passages in the Koran to the same effect. It would be natural to infer from this that the command directing Musulmans to fight all infidels until the latter confess the doctrine of the unity of God, implies distinctly the principle of aggressive war. Yet the Musulman doc tors differ in opinion on this point. The Djihad is Farz, i. e., binding on all Musulmans ; but this obligation falls into two categories : it is Jarzi ain (a personal duty), or simply Farzi gifaiet (a duty of capacity), according to circumstances. The Djihad admits of modification, suspension, or abro gation in certain circumstances, especially by means of treaties and tbe Amauu. Nations that have concluded treaties with Musulmans do not cease on that account to be Harbis (infidels) ; nevertheless, as the war is sus pended, the country which they inhabit receives another name, being styled Dar-ul-mouvade a, which means the country of engagements or mutual treaties. The Amaun is a security granted to infidels, applying to their property as well as person. Its result is to suspend the Djihad immediately and completely, and it confers for"], [158, "144 LETTERS ON TURKEY. I etter VII. the whole period of its duration an appreciable value on the blood ofthe Harbis, which it did not previously possess. Besides this Djihad, there exists another \u2014 a moral Djihad, no less meritorious and laudable than the former, nay, even superior to it, since it has received the appella tion of Djihad akbar (the great war). Its object is like wise the conversion of infidels, but its weapons are those of persuasion, and not violence. \" Every action and word aiming at the confirmation and propagation of the true faith is Djihad.\" Hence the two professions that find especial favour in the eyes of Musulmans are arms and the study of the law, each leading to the same end by different paths. Civil Code, The civil legislature of the Ottomans is contained in six books, which treat of slavery and the affranchisement of slaves, of marriage and divorce, of wills and inherit ance, and of property in general. \u00a7 1. Of Slavery. Originally slaves formed a portion of the lawful booty (Ganimet) derived from the Djihad; and the Ganimet literally included not only prisoners captured on the field of battle, but all the inhabitants of the dar-ul-harb, from the moment that the latter refused to accept one of the two conditions offered to their choice, namely, conversion to Islamism, or the payment of tribute (haratch). Subsequently foreign commerce introduced slaves of another class, and the traffic in slaves was not considered unlawful Some of these slaves were brought from Abys-"], [159, "Letter VII. SLAVES. 145 siuia, and the negro countries on the frontiers of Barbary ; others from Georgia and Circassia, countries renowned in all ages for the beauty of the inhabitants. Even in the present day these provinces furnish the small number of women who are sold as slaves in Turkey, and who are destined by their parents, from birth, for this kind of traffic. The number of slaves in Turkey daily diminishes, for they are no longer derived from war, and the importations from foreign countries are becoming fewer every year, in consequence of changes in the customs of the nation, or of the impediments which the government places in the way of the traffic. An imperial decree, issued at the close of the year 184G, directed the slave-market (awret bazar) to be closed, and this disgraceful trade, which was formerly opeidy carried on, has since become a clandes tine operation, merely tolerated by the law, and gradually disappearing. The number of slaves registered in the lists of the Stambol Efendissi does not exceed fifty-two thousand, whereof forty-seven thousand are female slaves, white and black This computation, when we have deducted the non-Musulman population and the foreign ers, who do not hold slaves, leaves a proportion of 12 per cent, for the rest of the population. In the provinces, where it seldom happens that a private individual marries more than one wife, and where consequently the house hold is much less considerable, the number of slaves does not exceed 2 or 2\u00a3 per cent.1 * In ancient Rome the proportion of slaves amounted to a moiety of the population. An evidence of this is presented in the revolt of Spar - tacus, who succeeded in a few weeks in uniting under his flag VOL. I. H"], [160, "146 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter VII The ordinary price of a slave varies, according to age and quality, from three to five thousand piastres for males, and from three thousand to a hundred thousand piastres for females. A Circassian girl, from fourteen to eighteen years osage, and possessed of personal attractions, fetches commonly from fifty to sixty thousand piastres. The duties of slaves are entirely household and do mestic. The master does not exact more from them than from the other servants of the family, from whom they are not distinguished. Attached to the personal ser vice of the master or his wives, they commonly live in the Selamlek or the harem,5 and share in the sedentary and indolent life of their owners. Eunuchs to whom the charge of the harem was formerly confided, are no longer found except in the imperial palace ; they are classed into four chambers or Odas, under the supreme command of the Kislar-Agasi and of the Kapou-Agasi, or chief of the white eunuchs. Persons in ordinary life employ only female slaves or servants in their harems. The regulations of the Code which defines the rights of masters over their slaves, show how superior is the condition of slavery in Turkey from that which existed in ancient Bome. Amongst the Romans the lawful and usual condition of slaves was that of beasts of burthen (servi in potestate domini sunt ut pecora, jamenta et cetera: res), they were considered legally dead {nullus ac pro slaves. Athen\u00e6us positively affirms that he knew at Rome a great many private individuals possessing .is many as 20,090 slaves. These num bers are corroborated by Seneca. \u2014 See the 'Statistics of the Nations of Antiquity,' by M. Moreau de Jonnes. 1851. 5 Selamlek, the part of the dwelling occupied by the men of the family ; Haran, that which is 8et apart for the women.\u2014 T."], [161, "Letter VII. SLAVES. 147 mortuo habetur), and the law, under the pretext of per mitting men to do as they please with their own property, handed over the slave to the absolute discretion of the master, who could strike and even put him to death.6 The Musulman law, in a milder spirit, recognises in the slave a human being possessed of certain inalienable rights : interposes at each moment of his existence to protect him, and opens to him various channels for regain ing his liberty, enabling him to purchase his freedom with his own earnings, and suggesting to his master every motive for affranchising him. To this end it has esta blished different conditions of slavery, which form so many steps leading from bondage to freedom. At Rome, on the other hand, however elevated or of whatever nature the employment of a slave, his ' civil ' condition remained always the same. (In servorum conditione nulla est dif ferentia.) The Multequa distinguishes between the state of abso lute and unconditional slavery (keulclik), and the other following gradations of meezoun, muhiateb, mudebber, rnu debberi-mukiateb, and ummul-velid. The first of these states is a condition of rigorous slavery nearly resembling what slavery was among the ancients. The Meezoun are those slaves who have received per mission from their masters to trade or work on their own 6 This principle was subsequently abandoned, and a rescript of the Emperor Antoninus Pius decreed the punishment of death against all who should put their slaves to death without legitimate cause; in the same way that the master who refused necessaries to his slave was bound to sell him; \"for,\" adds the imperial decree, \" expedit reipiib lic\u0153 ne sua re quis male utatur.\" \u2014 Inst. lib. i. tit. viii.

Their gains belong exclusively to themselves. They may possess slaves themselves, and may make them Meezoun if they choose. They are responsible for their own acts and debts, and may be seized and sold to defray the latter if refusing or unable to pay them. If they deal with their master, they may compel him like any other man to repay the goods he may have bought or the money he may have borrowed from them. They cannot, however, realize either money or goods without the consent of their master ; and should they happen to die childless or intestate, their master becomes their legal heir. The chddren of the Meezoun are their master's property unless the parents have been enfranchised, but they are also Meezoun. The Mukiateb is a slave who has received a Kitabet or contract. His freedom is made dependent on the ful filment of some stipulated condition agreed on with the master, as the rendering some stated service or the per formance of some given task, provided always that the condition embrace nothing contrary to law \u2014 in the mean time he may not be sold, lent, or hired-out to work. The Mukiateb may possess slaves of their own, and grant them privileges similar to what they enjoy themselves. They likewise receive permission to travel both for trade and for pleasure. The moment the terms of their contract are fulfilled they become free. If, on the other hand, they fail in fulfilling it within a given period, it becomes void, and they relapse into unconditional slavery.7 1 These and many other singular manners and customs recall the Arabian Nights.'"], [163, "Letter VII. SLAVES. 149 The Mudebbers are slaves whom their masters have released by a deed called Tebbir, which represents some future period, as, for instance, at the master's decease \u2014 at his return from a voyage or journey. The Tebbir registered at the office of the Cadi, or judge ofthe quarter, cannot be cancelled even by mutual consent of the par ties. In the mean time the Mudebber may be sold, hired out, or lent : he obtains no advantages or civil rights until the stipulated contingency takes place. When that happens, even though he had been sold to another master, his Tebbir has remained in force, and he obtains his freedom. The Mudebbiri-Mukiateb, having obtained both a Kitabet and a Tebbir, enjoys their united advantages. The Ummul-Velid are female slaves whose children have been acknowledged or adopted by the master. They become at once placed in the situation of the Mudebber. At the death of their master, if not previously enfranchised, they become free by right ; in the mean time they cannot be sold or alienated in any way. It may be laid down as a general rule that from the moment a female slave becomes pregnant she becomes entitled to all the privi leges of Ummul- Velid, even though force, accident, or sickness should destroy the infant at or before its birth. The child is considered free by birth. The enfranchise ment of a pregnant slave entails of course the freedom of the infant she bears. Cohabitation with female slaves is lawful, provided they be not pagans or idolaters, in which case it is totally forbidden. The same restrictions are to be observed respecting prohibited degrees of blood-rela tionship as apply to marriage."], [164, "Letter VIL 150 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

The giving birth to a child confers on the mother the freedom ofthe Ummul- Velid \u2014 the child, as before stated, is considered to be born free. The law which recognises these six conditions of slavery has re gulated with extreme care the immunities of each ; but even in the first and most rigorous class it does not go so far as to admit an absolute rijdit in the master over his slave. It pronounces that \u2014 The slave is the property of the master, who may dis pose of him, sell, or give him away, but he cannot put him to death. He cannot ill-use him, strike him unjustly, compel him to labour beyond his strength, or refuse him food or necessary clothing. If the master offend in any of these points, the slave has a right to lodge a complaint before the Cadi. The deposition of a slave is received by tlie courts. He may even marry without the consent of his master, but the latter may in such case annul the marriage. The absolute enfranchisement (itk) of the slave is either the. result of oue of the above-mentioned conditions or pro ceeds from the spontaneous will of the master, who, in effecting it, pronounces these words, \" Ennte atik, hurr me tola \u2014 Be free, be unfettered, be thine own master.\" Such are the principal regulations contained in the ' Multequa' concerning slaves.

SLAVES. 151 West Indies. Slavery, as it exists in Turkey, loses in fact almost all its severity. Slaves, generally speaking, are more happy, better treated, and less subject to the acci dents aud vicissitudes of life, than the free servants, and are superior in this respect to the majority of the servants in Europe. At any rate their felicity will seem great in deed if we compare their condition with that of negro slaves in Christian countries. Not only are slaves in Turkey free from all legal disqualifications, but they even rise to the highest political positions in the state. Their condition of servitude in their master's house differs in nothing from that of the free domestics of the family, except that they receive no regular wages : hut the habitual liberality of their master, and the custom uni versal in Turkey, of bakshish, or presents, amply com pensate them for the want of a fixed salary. In some respects the slave is often better treated than the free servant, since with many Turkish masters the forlorn, isolated condition of the slave, cut off from his family and his people, pleads for his receiving greater kindness. Why, indeed, should it be otherwise ? The man who practises beneficence towards even the inferior animals, aud who believes he is performing an action well-pleasing to God when he buys captive birds that he may restore them to liberty, will not treat his slave whom he regards as a fellow-creature with severity. He addresses him as \" My son ;\" he commands without harshness, and never seeks to him. Is it not God's wdl that one should be a slave and the other his master? and might not the reverse as well have come to pass ?

The slave who has thus refused his enfranchisement is called Azadsigkeule : the renowned Hussein Pasha, raised by the friendship of Selim III. to the rank of Grand Admiral, Capitau Pasha, never made use of any other title in his letters.8 8 Male slaves who have been purchased as adults are rarely retained in bondage longer than from seven to nine years; the Prophet having assigned that period as the term at which a slave ought to be manu mitted. The following remarks are from G. A. Olivier, an authentic writer on Turkey : \u2014 ''We should have a false idea of slavery among the Turks and Persians if we judged of it by that which prevails in European colonies, and above all from the accounts of the treatment of unfortunate cap tives on the coast of Barbary, who used to be subjected to all sorts of cruelties, and tormented in a thousand ways, to compel them to embrace the Musulman religion.

Marital Authority. \u2014 The marital power of the husband over the wife refers only to the advantages and enjoyments residting from his union with her, and consti tutes a fictitious power, mulk musha, widely different from the real power, mulk ain, of a master over his slave. He has, however, the right to forbid her leaving the house without his permission, and to compel her to reside in any house or district that he may think proper ; but he can not force her to accompany him to another town, nor on a journey, unless for a shorter duration than three days (messafez seffer). He has the right to interdict frequent communication with her near relatives of either sex ; but he cannot refuse her permission to see her father and mother at least once a week, on Friday, and her other near relations once a year, in the daytime, either at her own house or theirs. 5. Repudiation and Divorce. \u2014 The law makes a distinction between these two acts ; repudiation (talak) being reserved to the husband ; but he cannot use the right except for grave and weighty reasons : according to the words of the \" Celestial Messenger \" \u2014 \" May God curse him who repudiates his wife merely for his own pleasure.\" Even motives of piety are not deemed suffi cient to justify him. A delay of three months must elapse before the repu diation can be confirmed. When this period, called Iddet,"], [170, "Letter VII, 156 LETTERS ON TURKEY. and fixed by the law, has expired,1 if the husband still persist in his determination, he must restore in full what ever dowry he received with his wife ; or, if she had no dowry, he must assign b;r an honourable maintenance according to his means f nor can he take her back, even should he desire it, unless she has been again married and divorced by another.3 Such conditions render repudi ations extremely rare, and restrict them almost entirely to cases in which the wife is childless.4 Divorce ( Tefrik) takes place by mutual consent, or by desire of the wife alone ; it may be granted for various reasons \u2014 religious apostacy on the part of the husband, his neglecting to provide suitably for his wife's mainte nance, and some others.5 1 Throughout the East the most cruel insult that can be offered is to repeat three times the word Talak, which implies complete repudiation and the. dishonour of the Harem. \u2014 Von Hammer,- Hist.

The want of children, therefore, j affects the lot of a Turkish wife : it deprives her of many advan- ,ud she must submit without a murmur to the introduction of auother wife into the Harem, or to a compromise such as Sarah made with Abraham. 5 With respect to divorce, the law confers on women nearly equal facilities as their husbands in relieving themselves from ties they do not cherish ; and women in Turkey, when of rank and fortune equal to their husbands, do exercise that power more than the men, and hold it over their husbands as a check on polygamy.

This Code, which regulates the proceedings in civil and criminal causes, occupies two books of the Multequa ; one of which is entitled Cazas (Sentences), and the other Ohehadet (Testimony). I shall treat of it more fully in the next Letter when I come to speak of the changes which recent legislation has introduced. The Penal Code. The Penal Law of the Multequa is contained in three Books. Most of its enactments have been abolished by the new Code of 1840. The first of these books is called Hodoud, signifying in Arabic limits, or barriers placed around the law, which must not be transgressed ; the two others, relating to the Kecas (retaliation), or to the diiet (redemption by purchase), have also been abolished or modified by the legislation now in vogue. Commercial Code. All that the Multequa decreed relating to trade and commerce, forming two voluminous Books, has been super seded by a new code, taken in great part from the Com mercial Code of France. The Game Laws. The enactments respecting the rights of the chase occupy six Books of the Multequa, and regulate the law-"], [174, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. 160 ful season for killing game, the licence (Teskere), the kind of arms that may be employed, the species of ani mals that come under the head of game, and the invoca tion, In the name of God gracious and merciful, which the Musulmans employ on all occasions, and which must never he omitted in the slaughtering of animals. Such is the outline of the famous 'Multequa,' a Code comprising within itself more matter than all the legisla tion of the Western nations. Its compilers having been Theologians rather than Jurists, it confounds laws and morals together, and indeed resembles a Code of Morals quite as much as a Code of Laws. The Law is one and undivided ; and though, in common with other writers, I have, for the sake of perspicuity, spoken of it as \" separated into two branches, the Reli gious and the Civil,\" such a distinction is entirely arbi trary, and not to be met with in the Books. It is a simi lar fiction which attributes to the person of the Musul man Sovereign, or Padishah, a twofold prerogative : the Spiritual described by his title of Imaum, and represented by his minister the Sheikh-ul-Islam ; and the Temporal described by his title of Sultan, and represented by his minister the Grand Vizier. No one who has not resided long and continuously in Turkey, and had many connections and dependencies among the people, can thoroughly understand how inti mately respect for the law is bound up with every action of a Musulman's life, so that obedience to the civil law and religious duty towards God mean, in his comprehen sion, the same thing. For example, the laws concerning the least important matters, those for instance relating to"], [175, "Letter VII. THE MULTEQUA. 161 the preservation of game, and those relating to the duties of prayer, would be considered equally binding, and the same stress laid on the exact observance of one as the other. If statistical tables of crime could be accurately drawn up for Constantinople, the third most populous city in Europe, and compared with similar returns from London and Paris, the results would be astounding and almost incredible in the small proportion of offences they would show as regarded the Turkish population. In Turkish villages, whose inhabitants are unmingled with other races, trickery, deceit, and theft are scarcely known.7 Highway robberies, murders, rapes housebreaking, even pilfering, are almost unheard of in the lower ranks of Turks, and the people in general must clearly be under some restraint more effectual than fear of discovery and punish ment, since the country is so extensive, and the roads so 7 \" Whether the Turks look on stealing as degrading, or are restrained by respect for the law, housebreaking or pilfering by Turks scarcely ever happens at Constantinople.

So long as the Turks remained isolated like a household of strangers encamped in the midst of surrounding nations, this peculiar identification of religion and law might have continued to subsist, and to answer all purposes ;8 but from the hour that Turkey, resolving to discard the isolating and exclusive spirit of past ages, invites the approaches of European civilisation, it becomes evident the ancient codes can no longer suffice. It became necessary to frame new regulations when new riches, luxuries, and all the attendant train of Western civilisation introduced new crimes and subjects of contention. The Hatti-sherif of Gul-Haneh did not omit to notice the necessity for revising the ancient codes, hut so vast an undertaking could not be accomplished in a day. The first requisite was to detach the laws (properly so called), civil and criminal, from the mass of religious and moral injunctions with which they had hitherto been overlaid and blended The Government has persevered in its important task with praiseworthy energy. The fruits of its labours up to the present time have been a new Penal Code (promulgated in 1840). Various Ordinances, or Decrees, called Talimaii o'Meumieh, issued in 1846.

Letter VII. 164 without any respect to the rank or position of the delin- quent. Unquestionably this piece of legislation, when viewed according to our Western ideas, falls very far short of perfection. Its nomenclature is incomplete, and its clas sification defective. Many important points are omitted, or scarcely noticed ; and it is open in some measure to the same objection as the ancient Code Multequa, that of being a collection of precepts rather than a digest of statutes. This is partly attributable to the very nature of Islam ism. But, notwithstanding confusion, obscurity, and other defects, two great principles pervade it : the first is of great antiquity, coeval even with the first centuries of Islamism ; I allude to the legal axiom which appeals to the people for the execution of the law, and to which I alluded in the preceding Letter : It is the duty of < very one to be vigilant, The other principle is more recent, and only dates since the reforms : this is the absolute equality between all the subjects of the empire, without distinction of race or faith, proclaimed for the first time by the Hatti-Sherif of Gul-Haneh, and which receives a formal sanction by this Code. In perusing this document attentively we cannot fail to be struck by the naivete of certain avowals : His Highness having bound, himself not to put to death publicly or secretly, either by poison or otherwise, Sse His Highness having abstained from usurping the goods or property of any pri vate individuals, it is no longer permitted, Src. . . . nur to compel any one to sell his property in order that they may 1 See p. 128."], [179, "Letter VII. ORDINANCES OF 1846. 165 become unjustly possessed of it. Such an energetic censure of the past seems a pledge of security for the future. Thus, defective though it is, the penal code of 1840 has great value, as an index of the social state of Turkey, especially if we consider that it was promulgated within six months after the declaration of Gul-Haneh. This was a great result to be obtained in so short a space of time, especially in Turkey, where matters seldom progress so rapidly. In order to appreciate the real character and value of this code, incomplete as it may be, let us look back thirty years to the reign of Sultan Mahmoud, and we shall perceive many symptoms of decay in the Turkish empire : arbitrary confiscations and imprisonments ; or ganised robbery ; corruption in all the branches of the administration ; the extortions of the pashas, and abuses of power by the agents of Government more than by the Government itself ; in short, all the evils which the Code of 1840 has endeavoured to remedy. 2. The Ordinances of 1846. The Imperial Decrees or Ordinances, known by the name of Talimdti o' moumieh, form a kind of administra tive Code. They were chiefly intended tc determine the duties and limit the attributions of the various function aries of the empire. They are directed to three objects, namely, the administration iu general, the officials in the treasury, and the general police of the empire. They comprise a number of regulations excellent in themselves, and which would be still more valuable if properly carried into effect."], [180, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter VII. 166 3. Commercial Code of 1850. An Imperial decree dated the 14th of Djemazil-akhir, 1264 (12th of May, 1848), commanded the drawing up of this Code, which is copied almost literally from the commercial laws of France. It was completed about the end of 1850, and to come into operation after the lst of Moharrem,2 in the year 1267 of the Hegira (November 5th, 1850). The Ottoman Commercial Code, consisting of 315 arti cles, is divided into two parts. The first treats of com merce in general, of partnership, and the laws relating to bills of exchange ; the second refers to bankruptcies. As regards the organisation of the tribunals themselves, it is not included in this code, and has been determined by special regulations, of which I shall speak in the fol lowing Letter. 8 The lst of Moharrem is the first day of the Musulman year; but it has no certain analogy in our calendar. This ic natural, because the Musulman year is lunar, and composed of twelve months, which are : Rebil-evvel, Itebil-akhir, Ztfemazjl-em il-akhir, Redjeb, Chaban, liamazun, Chemi, Zilccdi, and Zilhidje. The months, con sisting alternately of twenty-nine and thirty days, begin with the new moon, and give three hundred and fifty -four days for the whole year, a number that is not quite exact, for the annual course of the moon exceeds this number by eight hours and forty -eight minutes. Hence, to bring the beginning of every month into connexion with the new moon, one day is added during thirty years to every third year, beginning with the second year in that interval. It follows from this mode of reckoning, that the initial day of the Musulman year shifts about from one season to another, and has nothing in common with the motion of the sun, or with our civil year; and hence the religious and political anniversaries never occur at the right season."], [181, "Letter VIII.

In criminal cases, justice is administered by the Cazas, or ordinary tribunals, in conjunction with the Governor of the district, and the Bledjlis or Provincial Councils.4 The court or tribunal thus composed pronounces sen tence without appeal, both in correctional and criminal cases, although the relation between particular crimes and their punishment is by no means clearly established ; and likewise orders the execution of its own sentence : the sentence, however, is not final in cases which involve the punishment of death. All trials which may terminate in capital convictions must be submitted to the revision of the Supreme Council of Justice, at Constantinople, and finally laid before the Sultan himself. Without his sanction and signature no sentence of death is now valid, or can be carried into execution in any part of the Ottoman dominions.0 The punishments which the ordinary tribunals are competent to inflict are : condemnation to the galleys, imprisonment, and banishment to any spot within the limits of the empire. The law in Turkey does not admit ignominious penalties, and not only does no infamy attach to the punishment, but is scarcely connected in the public mind with the transgression ; tlie party who suffers is regarded rather with compassion than censure.

The Supreme Council of Justice likewise takes cognizance of all offences against the State, and of all malversations aud abuses of power committed by any of the functionaries of the government in the exercise of their authority. For instance, in 1841 the late Grand Vizier, Khosrew Pasha, accused of corruption in his office and embezzlement of the public money, was summoned before this tribunal, found guilty, and obliged to refund the sums he had corruptly appropriated. He was also depriied of all his dignities and titles, condemned to banishment, and ouly escaped a severer penalty because the principal offences with which he was charged had been committed prior to the promulgation of the new penal code, which he himself had within a few months signed in his capacity of Grand Vizier. Hassan Pasha, governor of Koniah, was likewise cited some three or four years ago before the same tribunal, for having on some trifling provocation, in a moment of rage, killed one of he servants of the Mal mudiri. His guilt being proved, he was condemned to the galleys for life, and compelled to labour as a criminal in the same city where he had been for several years obeyed as governor. These facts created a great sensation at the time, and I now recall them as examples of the salutary severity and firmness of the Turkish government, in reply to the frequent complaints and reproaches which we hear made against it for indifference to violence and i 2"], [186, "Letter VIII. 172 LETTERS ON TURKEY. for want of energy in repressing abuses, &c.

Mixed Tribunals. The jurisdiction of the different tribunals hitherto enu merated is confined in civil matters to the adjudication of disputes and lawsuits between Musulmans them selves or Musulmans and Ra'iahs : in criminal matters it embraces all offences committed by one subject of the empire against another, irrespective of race or creed. Lawsuits between non-Musulman subjects of the empire, who happen to be members of the same community, are submitted for decision to the head of the nation to which the disputants belong- ; the Greek and Armenian patri archs, and the Jewish Khakan Bashi, or Chief Rabbi, being regarded by the Turkish government as the reli gious and civil heads of their respective nations ; and, as such, invested with authority to decide in whatever contests and differences arise amongst their people. However, the contending parties, if dissatisfied with the decision of their own chief, have the legal right of ap pealing to the Turkish tribunals ; hut this right for the most part remains a dead letter, the parties having sworn beforehand to submit to the sentence of their national head.

They form a distinct class, denominated \" Franks ;\" enjoy special privileges and immunities by reason of certain treaties, styled Capitulations ;e and in whatever concerns their intercourse with Ottoman subjects are now subject to a special jurisdiction, administered by what are called the Mixed Tkibuxa^s.

Mixed Tribunals of Commerce Were established in April, 1847.

The Porte, on the other hand, was likewise to appoint, ten persons of similar standing and character from among its own subjects, both Musulmans and Raiiahs, so that the tribunal might consist of an equal number of Ottoman and European members ; the latter being, as ive said, named by all the European legations con jointly.

The Mixed Tribunals of Commerce hold their sittings every Thursday. Experience has demonstrated the advantages that arise from the institution of these tribunals, which, having heen the means of abolishing many abuses hitherto deemed irremediable, may unquestionably be regarded as amongst the most important benefits hitherto conferred on Turkey by her reforming party.

Indeed, most of the Cadis or magistrates who preside in the Mekhemehs, from the rapid manner in which they dispose of the cases brought before them, appear to have chosen as their model the Grand Vizier Churluli Ali Pasha, a dignitary of whom Cantemir speaks in a curious passage, which deserves a place here : \u2014 \" When he sat in the Divan, it was impossible to regard him without admiration, for he had such a clear and active mind, that he was able to do three things at a time. In order to despatch business more expeditiously, he used to cause two petitions to be read to him at once ; he heard and understood each of these cases as well as if they had been repeated four times, and he was able ac cordingly to pronounce a suitable judgment.

Through the increased security which they offer to commercial trans actions, commerce becomes extended ; and forming as they do, both in the capital and the chief cities of the empire, a species of model tribunal, they prepare the way for a thorough reform in Ottoman jurisprudence. We may therefore regard the establishment of these Tribunals as a happy inspiration of the prudent policy which aims at amending the institutions of the country without shocking its prejudices, and at enlightening rather than doing violence to public opinion.

The abuses which must inevitably arise out of the a above described, of providing for the functionaries of the law, are too manifest to need description.

This iniquitous privilege was only enjoyed by Mollahs of the first class. But though the Arpalyks have been abolished, too many other abuses yet remain, and constitute the crying evil, the well-merited reproach, and the great obstacle to real im provement in the government of Turkey. For example \u2014 1. The concentration of all legal functions and judicial authority in the hands of the Ulema, opposed as that body systematically is to all reform and progress. 2. The want of fixed salaries to Judges and other legal functionaries, which greatly tends to increase the number and duration of lawsuits, by founding the wealth of the Judge on the ruin of suitors. 3. The certainty which the Judge has of being super seded at the termination oshis year of office, which almost compels him to rapacity by the necessity of securing in a short time means for future maintenance. 4. The absence of legal and efficient control over the Legal functionaries by the State, which thus gives impunity to a corrupt, or an unjust magistrate. 5. The facility of obtaining false testimony. 6. The privilege which the plaintiff has of choosing his Judge, aud which gives him an almost certain advantage over the defendant, his first care being of course to secure the Judge in his interest.

The other, provided with witnesses, laid his whole stress on them aud on his adversary's defective proof \u2014 in being without them. After calmly hearing all that each party had to urge, and especially the arguments and appeals of the rich defendant, who insisted vehe mently on the right being his because his opponent could produce no witnesses, the Cadi, gravely addressing the latter, said, ' You have been under a great mistake in this suit, for, if your poor adversary can bring forward no witnesses in confirmation of his right, I myself can furnish him with five hundred.' So saying, he drew forth the bag of threw it to the astonished suitor with reproaches and indigna tion, and decreed the disputed property in favour of the poor man.\" The other instance exemplifies a respect for the law and the security of private property which must appear strange to those who adopt the commonly-received prejudices concerning the tyranny and violence of \" Turkish despotism.\" \" In the year 1755 the Porte weus entirely burned down.

Most of the owners willingly agreed to a sale, which was offered them on very advantageous terms; one old woman however declared that she would not part with her house : it had been in her family for many gene rations, and no money could compensate the infinite value she set upon it. Neither offers could tempt nor threats avail anything to move her. The men in authority cried out and abused her; but the in justice of taking it by violence none dared commit.

Accordingly, in the year 18*45, a Ferman was Issued, decreeing the establishment of an Ottoman University, and remodelling the whole system of public instruction. This, so far as it existed, had hitherto been entirely in the hands of the Ulema, and by them so managed (the studies being restricted to the narrowest circle of religious and literary subjects), that, instead of becoming a prepara tion for a career of active, useful public life, its tendency was to keep Turkey in a state of isolation from other nations, thus raising up impediments in the path of the Government, which desired to pursue a totally opposite course. The question therefore was not merely that of reforming and new modelling the course of instruction, but one far more important and difficult, namely, to strip the Ulema of one of their most essential prerogatives ; to secularise the public instruction, so to speak, and substitute the education of the State for that of the Mosque. This latter, apart from political tendencies, and con- 1 Eugene Bore', . ti.t East, 1840."], [207, "Letter IX. PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 193 sidered merely with reference to the instruction imparted, was, indeed, most wretched. It was, as already stated, divided iuto two branches : \u2014 First, Elementary Instruction provided by the Mektebs, or Primary Schools ; and, secondly, Superior Instruction furnished by the Mudiresehs, or Colleges. In the former there was little to change or improve. Established in every quarter of each city, and even in the smallest villages, almost gratuitous (for a moderate payment of two piastres per month for each child must be considered so), confining, it is true, their instruction to the principles of religion and morality, and to the reading of the Koran, but attended by a large number of children,8 these rudi mentary Schools only required a few improvements easy of adoption, and some assistance from the State, in order fully to satisfy all the requirements of a good elementary education. The second branch or section comprised the education iu -the higher schools or Mudiresehs. These owed their origin to Mohammed II. , the Conqueror of Constantinople. Immediately after the conquest, he converted eight of the principal Christian churches into Djami,3 annexing to each a college, for the maintenance of which he assigned a portion of their revenues. At a later period he erected the Mosque which still bears his name, Mohamruedieyh, together with eight colleges, or Mudiresehs.

During the following reigns, propor tionate to the extraordinary increase in the number of the Mosques was that of the Imarets (hospitals) aud of the Mudiresehs (colleges). For, as we have frequently observed, the obligations appertaining to religion, charity, and learning among the Turks, are so blended and son founded together, that obedience to one is obedience to all. In 1765, at the time of Mustapha III., the number of these establishments, within the precincts of Constanti nople alone, was two hundred and seventy-five. At the present day it exceeds three hundred. Each town boasts of, at least, one Mudireseh ; and the large cities, as Adrianople, Bagdad, Cairo, possess from forty to fifty. Tbe course of studies in the Mudiresehs, meagre as it is, is conducted with much order and regularity.

Another impediment to progress was presented by the very course of study adopted in the Mudiresehs. Resting on no solid basis, the learning they imparted was adapted to bewilder the intellect itr a labyrinth of barren definitions and frivolous distinctions, and to overload the memory with a multitude of useless names, quotations, and recondite terms, borrowed from a language no longer in common use. and the acquisition of which alone demanded several years of study. Everything, reduced to abstract and subtle discussion, recalled the pedantry of the Lower Empire and the puerilities of the schoolmen. Turkey, in its schools as in its policy, was a perfect type of the middle ages : sophistry was the employment of its scholars, who were at the same time unacquainted with the very rudiments of geography, history, and chronology ; they were completely ignorant of the relations of nations to each other, as well as of the various forms of their go vernments, and their knowledge in matters of politics and history seldom went beyond the affairs and frontiers of their own country\u2014 if indeed it extended so far. How, in fact, could it nave been otherwise, under a blind and selfish system which admitted nothing beyond itself, rejected all new facts and modern discoveries as childish or impious, and despised the majority of mathematical and physical instruments, as vain toys only adapted to pass away a vacant moment, or gratify an idle curiosity, and proscribed the use of them in schools, just as the Janissaries preferred to perish rather than adopt the arms and military tactics of the"], [211, "Letter IX. 197 PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. Europeans ? Such a state of things not only constituted in itself an insurmountable obstacle to all improvement in national education, but had the effect of giving up the youth of the nation to the pernicious influence of the Ulema, and fostering in the heart of the country a focus of opposition and hostility towards the Government which rendered reform of all kinds nearly impracticable. The Government at length perceived that no alternative re mained but to take the matter into its own hands, and by a reorganisation of the whole system of public education to put an end to the intrigues of the anti-reform party. In March 1845 a Commission was appointed with power to seek and examine the most efficacious methods of amending the system of Public Education in Turkey, and to propose to the Government a new and complete course of Instruction suited to the growing wants of the country. The Commissioners were selected, with a praiseworthy disregard to favouritism and party spirit, from among the men who had given the strongest proofs of their capa bility, or of their attachment to the cause of reform. \u2014 Their names were as follows : Akif-Hamet-Bet (present Sheikh-ul-Islam ), President.

In accordance with this report, the Ottoman University was declared a State institution ; a permanent \"Council of Public Instruction\" was placed at its head; and the course of Public Education divided into three dif ferent degrees, namely : \u2014 Primary or Elementary Education, \u2014 the principal ele ments of which already existed in the Mekt, bl , Secondary or Intermediate Education, \u2014 which had to be created, nothing analogous having hitherto existed in Turkey ; and Higher or Superior Education,\u2014 which was to be re modelled on a new basis, doing as little violence as possible to existing privileges and prejudices. Tliis report was speedily followed by two Imperial decrees : the one converting the labours of the Commis sion into a law of the Empire ; \u2014 the other instituting a permanent \" Council of Public Instruction \" (Medjliqi duimi mearifi mimoumii), which was intrusted with the execution of the above law. This Council, under the direction of the President of the Council of State and of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was composed chiefly of members employed on the Commission, with the addition of the Chief Physician of the Empire, and Director of the School of Galata-Serai, Ismail Effendi. A third Ordinance decreed the erection of a building, to be the seat of the new University.

The results of their labours, which yet cannot be considered as com plete, may be best explained by following the above mentioned division. Elementary Education. The state of the elementary or primary schools, and the ameliorations they were susceptible of receiving, first engaged the attention of the Council. Here, as I have already observed, the task of reform was simple. The Mektebs had existed for centuries, and fulfilled their duties with tolerable efficiency : all that was now requisite was to give them a uniform organisation, to introduce some modifications into the matter and manner of their teaching, and to apply the principle of State supervision in its fullest extent. With these objects in view the first measure of the Council was to declare the Instruction in the Mektebs obligatory and gratuitous ; and that for the sum of two piastres per month formerly paid to the master by each scholar should be substituted a fixed salary drawn from the revenues ofthe Mekteb. Indeed, the majority of these Schools, having been anciently founded by private donations and legacies, possess independent revenues of their own distinct from those of the Mosques, and from which funds are readily forthcoming for the repairs and maintenance of the school and the salary of the teacher ; wherever these revenues happen to be insufficient, the Go vernment makes up the required amount. At the same time the law obliges all fathers of Musulman families,"], [214, "200 LETTERS ONT TURKEY. Letter IX. as soon as their children of both sexes have attained the age of six years, to present themselves before the Mnchtar, or municipal chief of the district, in order to have their children inscribed on the registers ofthe Mekteb, unless they prove their intention to give them a suitable education at home. Among the means adopted to insure the execution of this measure, the law forbids masters to take apprentices without a certificate from the Mekteb. As to the matters taught, they remained pretty much as before, and consisted of reading, writing, the elements of orthography and arithmetic, and more especially a know ledge of the principles of religion and morality. The only change of importance was the adoption of better ele mentary books, written in the common Turkish dialect, expressly for the use of children, and ordered by the Council to be employed in the schools. In the year 1852 there were 39si of these elementary schools at Constantinople attended by 22,700 pupils of both sexes. These three hundred and ninety-six schools have been divided into fourteen sections, corresponding to the fourteen principal quarters of the capital. In each section a central committee of management inspects the schools, receives a regular monthly return of the number and progress of the pupils, controls the conduct of the masters, orders any improvements that appear desirable, and takes care that the intentions of the Government are fully and faithfully carried into effect.

After four or five years passed in the Mekteb, the boy who wishes to continue his studies by following the course of public instruction enters the Secondary Schools, where he passes another period of four years. These schools, called Mektebi ruchdii or Adolescent schools, have only been a very few years in existence. In 1351 they amounted to six, and were attended by 870 pupds, which, though small in itself, is a considerable result in so short a space of time. Their number is intended to be increased to fourteen. The course of instruction comprehends \u2014 Arabic Syntax and Grammar. Orthography. Composition and Style. Sacred History. Ottoman History.

Letter IX. 202 Highest Class Education. The course of Higher Instruction particularly engaged the attention of the Council, for it forms the great scene of contest with the Ulema, and is in reality the foundation stone of all solid and effectual reform. The Government, which undertook to overthrow the monopoly held for so many years by a privileged body, required all its strength and all its prudence in order to struggle with advantage against the Mudiresehs. Fortunately, the Secondary Schools being only recently established, the students would be engaged several years in them before they were qualified to pass to the higher course of study, and the Council had therefore still some time before it. It pro fited by this to obtain all the lights which could assist its progress, and sent one of its members, Kemal Effendi, Inspector General of Schools, to study the organisation of the Universities in Germany, France, and England Kemal Effendi passed several months in Paris, where the Government placed at his disposal all that might facilitate the success of his mission. In fact, if the advancement of national education in Turkey is closely connected with the regeneration and duration of the Ottoman empire, the strength and duration of that empire is of the highest importance for the maintenance of the European balance of power, and for this reason, if for no other, the Porte would have a right to claim the sympathy and assistance of the Western Cabinets.

Professors of the highest qualifications are employed, and at the expiration of the allotted term of four yeare, the pupils, if sufficiently qualified, are to be admitted into the different ministerial departments, unless they should desire to prosecute their studies at the Univer sity, which is, by that time, expected to be in full vigour.

Shortly after the total destruction of the Janissaries Sultan Mahmoud IV. founded a College of Medicine at Galata Serai,'1 which, although on a very humble scale compared with its present condition, may yet claim the honour of being the first establishment for public education in the Turkish empire, as it is certainly that which up to the present time has produced the best, results. It is divided into two departments : the Preparatory Depart ment, and the Medical Department. The number of the students amounts to 410 \u2014 241 in the first, and 169 in the second. All are maintained at the Government expense, and are selected indiscriminately from the Musulman and non-Musulman subjects of the empire.

Latterly, the foundation, which is wholly gratuitous, has been -.placed upon a more extensive footing. A clinical ward for sixty Ipatients of all creeds has been added. Two days in the week are set \u25a0apart for gratuitous consultations, when persons of all classes can receive the advice of the chief director and other skilful surgeons. A ward for lying-in women has heen added, and is directed by a female pro- fessor, who gives lectures and instructions to a number of female pupils. The amount of prejudice on matters connected with therapeutic and pathological science, which has been overcome in a few years, is almost incredible. Subjects are now freely furnished to the school of ana tomy. This great innovation was accomplished by the enlk energy of the late Imperial physician, C'haneh Zadeh.* It was decided that the bodies of all convicts dying in the prison of the galleys should be sent for dissection, without distinction of creed. It remained, however, to overcome the repugnance of students and the opposition of the old hospital functionaries. The corpse of a Moslem was the first selected. This caused some murmuring, but the presence of the bashi (chief physician) himself allayed the opposition of some, and, the majority being young men desirous to acquire proficiency in their art, their scruples were soon overcome. At the present moment the practice of dissection is regularly established, and the supply of subjects is equal to the demand.

TROOPERS OF REFORMS. 209 When I revisited Turkey in 1852, I found to my grief and surprise that the progress had been considerably, if not entirely, checked. The Government, after com mencing with great vigour its reforms aud re-organisa tion of public education, had withdrawn its attention elsewhere. The building of the new University was suspended, and the foundation of Secondary or Middle Schools in the provinces was given up. One institution, however, had arisen in the interval \u2014 the Indjemen-Daniseh, or Academy of Science and Lite rature (\"Belles Lettres), which had been established for the purpose of improving the language and literature of Turkey, and promoting education in that country, by the publication or translation of works adapted to raise the standard of learning. But although this Academy reckons among its members all the most distinguished men of the empire, in politics as well as science, it has not as yet produced anything of consequence, except the Ottoman Grammar of Fuad Effendi, of which M. Bianchi has given an account in the Asiatic Journal of France. The question of Public Instruction still presses with vital importance on the statesmen of Turkey, and more than any other will influence her future destiny. By raising Education to the rank of a State institution, \u2014 by creating it where it does not yet exist, correcting its exclusive and bigoted character, and, above all, by extend ing to women the pleasures and advantages of intellectual culture, Turkey might be drawn from the isolation and individualism by which her strength is exhausted, and which, in the present state of European affairs and civi lization, are so dangerous to her existence.

By the establishment of univer sities, where students of every race and creed, collected from the most distant points of the empire, might live under a unity of discipline and instruction, a mutual good understanding would be created : those whom long fostered prejudices and mutual aversion, begot by mutual ignorance of each other's religion and character, had hitherto kept apart, might in time become united in cordial amity, or at least the invincible barriers of pre judice, which have hitherto separated them, would be weakened. In pursuit of a common object, they might discover that they had a common country, which each was endeavouring to serve in some useful manner, and thus the way might be prepared for that great national unity after which the Turkish administration, policy, and legislature are uow striving. Reform in Turkey has hitherto shaped its course with strict regard to the great principle of Legality, which is essential to its safety and its progress. If we keep not this truth constantly before our eyes, we shall be inca pable of forming a right, judgment of men or things in that country, where reform, like almost everything else, is the very reverse of what it would be in Europe.

A more perfect acquaint ance with the subject, and above all the power of looking at it from an Oriental as well as a European point of view, would have shown that the tardiness we complain of is fniost frequently the result of a wise circumspection, which, jadapting itself to the circumstances it has to deal with, seeks to turn opposition aside rather than to conquer it by force ; and ensures success by avoiding a struggle.

But to revert to the subject of Public Education : its course, on the whole, notwithstanding the check elsewhere mentioned, has been after all progressive and liberal ; and great things have been accomplished, even though some may have been left undone.

Some few of the Public Libraries, however, have been the special founda tions of Viziers, Muftis, and occasionally of private indi viduals : these are independent of any Mosque, and form distinct establishments. The Kitab Khaneh are for the most part elegant buildings : the halls, or rooms, in which the books are kept, are spacious and airy ; the manuscripts of various dimensions are written on vellum, and neatly bound in red, green, or black morocco leather ; each volume, the better to ensure its preservatiou from dust or injury, is enclosed in a morocco covering or case, on the back of whicli tbe title of the work is inscribed in large legible characters. This title is also repeated on the edges of the volume itself. The books are ranged horizontally one upon another, according to their contents, in presses, enclosed by glazed or latticed doors. Sometimes they are contained in large cages of gilt wire, which stand in the middle of the hall. The catalogues, compiled with great care, contain, besides the title of each work, a short extract of its con tents ; and every library, besides its own particular cata logue, possesses a general catalogue of all the works that exist in the three languages of the country, entitled, \" Essam y Kutub.\" \u00bb This word is sometimes incorrectly written Medressehs."], [229, "Letter X.

The first Ottoman Sultans sought, like their predecessors the Caliphs, to illustrate their reigns by encou raging learned men, and founding establishments wherein their labours, and those of their forerunners in the fields of science and literature, might be preserved to posterity. The greater part of the treasures of Arabic literature, collected by the Abasside Caliphs, perished in the various fires which at diflerent periods ravaged Bagdad, but principally in the great conflagration of 1060, which destroyed the famous library of the Vizier Erd-fheer, containing nearly 10,0o0 volumes ; and in 1258, when Bagdad was sacked and nearly destroyed by the grandson of Jenghis Khan. Nevertheless Mohammed II, was able to collect a sufficient number of books from Brousa, Damascus, and various other cities, to form the libraries of Eyoub, Santa Sophia, and of the Mosque erected by himself.

All possess special and ample funds for their preservation and the salaries of the librarians and servants, but it does not appeal* that these funds are employed in adding to their contents, which remain nearly the same as when they were first founded. The librarians are generally expert Calligraphers, who add to their resources by transcribing the valuable MSS. under their guardianship. The furniture is simple and scrupulously clean.

This mysterious Library has been the object of many fruitless inquiries and attempts, and has for a great length of time excited the curiosity of the learned, by reason of the vast number of Greek and Latin MSS. it was supposed to contain. Through the positive asser tion of Constantine Lascaris,3 confirmed by the testi mony of a multitude of travellers, among whom figures Delavalle, the learned world has frequently entertained the hope of recovering the whole of the Decades of Livy, the great history of Tacitus, that of Diodorus Siculus, and so many other lost or mutilated treasures, which it was supposed had been transferred from the palace of the Byzantine emperors to that of the Ottoman sultans. It was well known, also, that after the capture of Buda, in 1541, a great portion of the noble library of Matthias Corvinus fell into the hands of the Turks, and was carried to Con stantinople, where it served to swell the bibliographical treasures amassed in the Seraglio. However, all these conjectures remained unsupported by any proof, for access to the library was interdicted to Europeans.4 5 Villoison, Anecd. Gr\u0153c. t. ii. p. 264.

We discover from this catalogue, which Toderini inserted entire in his work,5 that the Seraglio library certainly contained a number of Greek and Latin MSS., but among them neither Tacitus nor Livy is mentioned. However, the catalogue quoted by Toderini must have been very incomplete, for he only gives us a list of 998 works, whilst D'Ohsson estimates their number at more than 1 5,000. 6 In 1801, at the moment when the cov' d\" the French expedition to Egypt caused English influence to be all-powerful with the Sublime Porte, Dr. Hunt and Mr. Carlyle obtained permission to visit the library of Mustafa III., and counted 1292 volumes, but noticed no Greek, Latin, or Hebrew manuscripts.

Not only was the request granted, but the Keeper of the Treasure (Khayineh) had orders to present the am bassador, on the conclusion of his visit, with the volumes that most attracted his attention. The General, having examined with the greatest care all the volumes in both libraries, and found only documents relating to ecclesi astical affairs, at length selected a very fine manuscript of the New Testament. In 1845 the Baron de Slane was employed by the French Governmeut to visit the libraries of Algeria and Constantiuople. The result of his researches is contained in a series of reports published in the Journal of National Education of France,8 but he was not more fortunate than liis predecessors. He states in a letter addressed to M.

All the other MSS. were on ecclesiastical subjects.

The information that I had personally an oppor- tunity of collecting at Constantinople, and the fact that in many of the libraries of Europe, and especially in the Imperial Library at Paris, ancient manuscripts may be seen, still bearing the Toughra, or cipher of the Ottoman Sultans, proving that they once belonged to the Seraglio, confirm me in thinking that a complete examination of all the MSS. now thrust away in various apartments and corners of the Seraglio would bring to light many lost and valuable treasures.

The majority of these works, although by Ottoman authors,"], [241, "Letter X. OTTOMAN LITERATURE : TOETRY. 227 were originally written in Arabic, that language being re garded as peculiarly consecrated to learning, either because it contained the original text of the Koran, or on account of the brilliancy which it attained under the Abasside Caliphs. Poetry, which occupies the fourth rank in Ottoman literature, is derived from the Persians. Persia indeed was the cradle of Musulman poetry. No names among Musulman poets yet rival those illustrious four \u2014 Saadi, Hafiz, Djami, and Ferdousi ; not even those of the seven Arabians whose works were deemed worthy of being suspended (Muallah kat) in the Holy Kaaba of Mecca. Poetry, in its most flourishing state among the Ottomans, has exhibited the perfume and brilliancy of an exotic, rather than the spon taneous vigour and luxuriance of a plant native to the soil. In the seventeen Ottoman Anthologies, commencing with that of Sehi, who died 1563, to that of Nazmi, the most modern and complete of all, we find more than two thousand names of poets, including sultans, generals, viziers, and even ivomen. There have been several Turk ish poetesses \u2014 the fair Mihri, the Ottoman Sappho, who lived in the reign of Bajazet II. , and sang in graceful strains her love for Iskander ; and in modern times Leilah Katoun, nearly related to the well-known Fuad Effendi, once minister of foreign affairs : she died at Con stantinople only a few years since.

Its aim is to convey virtuous sentiments and useful information, whether in the inscription which adorns the faqade of a fountain or a mosque ; or by the versification of facts of Chronology, History, and general information. Persian poetry may be classed as lyric and elegiac ; the poetry of the Arabians as epic ; and that of the Ottomans as didactic. Similar distinctions characterize the three languages, as expressed in the proverb common through out the East, which declares \u2014 The Arabic is Ep the Persian Honey, and the Turkish Science. H [STORY. The historians constitute a numerous class in Ottoman literature ; those especially who have employed themselves in Biography and Chronology. Under the first head we find innumerable Collections, or Remains (Recueils), which treat of the lives and actions of all the celebrated per sonages of the East \u2014 princes, poets, physicians, sheikhs, muftis, &c. &c. Of these works the most celebrated, besides the seventeen Anthologies already cited, are the following : \u2014 Ali's History of Meritorious Men ; Lives of the Viziers, by Osman Effendi : Lives of the Reis Effendi.-! ; and a work containing an account of more than four thousand Ulemas and Sheikhs, besides other biogra phies, by an author who died in 1589.

Ofthe latter another Turkish author declares that \"he was the first who under stood the true manner of writing history.\" A work of real interest and value is an uninterrupted series of Annals, in Turkish, drawn up by the imperial historiographers, and comprising the whole course of events from the foundation of the empire to the present time. The first of these ' Annals ' is styled Tlie Crown of Chronicles: it is by Saad Eddeen, who for elegance and richness of style is placed in the first rank of Ottoman historians. Saad Eddeen, who was Mufti in the reign of Amurath (Murad) III., was employed by that prince to* write the history of the empire from the era of its foun dation. He was appointed for this purpose Imperial Historiographer, and the office has been continued ever since. His Chronicle, which was compiled from the labours of earlier historians, commences with the first dawn of the monarchy, and comes down to the reign of Solyman, 1520. The following seventy-two years are occupied by the chronicles of Djelat Zadeh-und Selanekeh, and then we begin the series of printed ' Annals,' which are as fol lows : \u2014 1.

Their very prolixity, arising out of the exact ness with which chronological order and arrangement are observed, and the scrupulous care devoted to the relation of the most minute as well as the most important events, srives them immense value as faithful records ; and the original, and, so to speak, sincere views of the writers, not enlarged, indeed, but free at least from the fetters of theories and systems, invest them with a peculiar inte rest. Nor are they deficient in beauties of a certain sort. The discourses introduced into them on the occasions of great events\u2014 the dying exhortations of monarchs to their successors \u2014 the military harangues of sultans and viziers \u2014 are equal in eloquence, and perhaps in authenticity, to some ofthe finest passages ofa similar kind in the classical historians of antiquity. Occasionally we find quotations from the letters and writings of various sultans, which show considerable lite rary cultivation as well as ability. The authenticity of these rests upon a surer foundation, since the original documents cited by the historians are preserved in the Imperial Archives.7 There are two classes of writings which are not com prehended in any of the five sections of Turkish litera ture above mentioned, but which are too remarkable to be passed over. The first comprises the innumerable dissertations on manners, ceremonies, and polite beha viour in general, which abound in every Ottoman hbrary ; 7 See the celebrated letter -from the Sultan Selim to Shah Ismael, quoted at length in the history of M, von Hammer."], [248, "234 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

They give minute and precise instructions con cerning the manner of dressing, sitting, standing, of behaviour at table, of salutation, of receiving and ap proaching superiors, inferiors, or equals in rank, &c. &c. Of the two hundred and sixteen works by moralists and poets mentioned by Toderini, in the Seraglio Library, above thirty treat exclusively of politeness and manners.3 Some of these works are theoretical essays on moral con duct and behaviour, somewhat in the style of Castiglioni's celebrated ' Cortegiano.' Others are mere sets of rules for outward demeanour, models of addresses and super scriptions of letters, &c.

In fact the outward behaviour of the Turks, deriving, like every other part of their social condition, its authority from their Religious Law, assumes a higher import than Western nations have any conception of; and the con stant and universal practice of precepts so derived, tends to impress the Ottoman physiognomy with that air of dis tinction and polished dignity which is found in all ranks of society.

The rage for these singular compilations, which often present very curious and unexpected matter, prevails very extensively among the Turks : every man of letters has several of them in his library, and gene rally also compiles one or more for himself, according to his studies and tastes. The foregoing remarks on Ottoman literature apply almost entirely to the period anterior to the introduction of printing. Since that period Ottoman literature has been directed into various new channels, and promises to exercise a more important influence on the course of national progress. The first Turkish printing establishment dates from the year 1727, or 1140 of Musulman computation, in the reign of Sultan Achmet III. Hebrew, 9 Greek, and Armenian presses had, however, existed at Constan tinople from times almost coeval with their introduction into the other countries of Europe, but no success had attended any attempts to introduce them to the usage of the Turks before the time of Saad Effendi, son of Mo hammed,1 ambassador to France in 1720.

On his return to Turkey he, in conjunction with a Hun garian renegade of the name of Ibrahim Effendi, a man of great ability, drew up a memoir, detailing in an elaborate and skilful manner the benefits of printing. The result of this memoir, presented to the Sultan Achmet III., through the Grand Vizier, Ibrahim Pasha,2 and supported by the Mufti Abd-Ullah, was an imperial Hatti-sherif, dated the 15th of the month Zihildjeh, 1139 (or 5th of July, 1727), decreeing the formation of an Imperial printing establishment at Constantinople.3 penetrating into the arcana of Christian policy, and discovering the true situation and bearings of European politics, and the strength aud relations of the various Western governments.

It has been translated into French. 2 The grand vizierat of Ibrahim Pasha was one of the most glorious and flourishing on record. He perished three years later, in the revo lution which overthrew the throne of Achmet III. 3 Tliis decree sets forth that, owing to the destruction which had been caused, partly by fire, partly by the barbarism of conquest, to the rare collections of books in various parts of the world, many i works, of which no other copies existed, were for ever lost to religion and science ; that only a few copies of good works were now left, which were so dear as to be beyond the reach of most men ; and it was therefore a thing much to be desired, for the sake of learning and for society in general, that a printing-press, which would remedy and prevent these evils, should be established."], [251, "Letter X. INTRODUCTION OF PRINTING. 237 On the first rumour of the proposed innovation, alarm arose throughout Constantinople. The Ulema, under the pretence of zeal for the safety of the Sacred doctrines and traditions, but in reality dreading some attack on their own power, professed to regard the new project as profane. The emauations of human intelligence, they alleged, having been always handed down to posterity by writing, ought not to be subjected to any less careful mode of transmission. On the other hand, the legions of Kiatibs, or scribes, who are met with, or rather who were met with, at the entrance of every Mosque and bazaar (for their numbers are at the present day greatly diminished), exclaimed aloud against those who proposed to interfere with their \" vested rights,\" and even threatened to stone them : wrhilst a third party, the scholars and those who che rished literature for its own sake, were disturbed by fears lest the precious art of Calligraphy, which shed glory even on the noblest thoughts, by the beauteous lines and mar vellous symbolical interfacings of the letters and ciphers it employed in expressing them, should be lost to man kind. Notwithstanding all opposition, however, the result took place which will invariably occur in Turkey whenever an energetic and enlightened sovereign is supported by a Grand Vizier and a Sheikh-ul-Islam capable of compre hending and assisting his views. On this occasion the Sheikh-ul-Islam, Abd-UUah, deli vered a Fetvah to the following effect: \u2014 \"If one versed in the art of founding types, and printing exact copies of manuscripts, should be able by his labour and skill"], [252, "Letter X.

The direction of the new establishment was confided to its two original projectors, Saad Effendi and Ibrahim Effendi ; and its cost was defrayed out of the public trea sury. The works produced will be mentioned presently. In the year 1756, twenty-nine years after the founda tion of the establishment, only eighteen different works, forming twenty-five volumes, had been printed at it. Of these, 16,500 copies in all were issued, the prices of which, fixed by Government, varied from 11. lbs. to 31. 12s. each, English money.4 Ibrahim Effendi was succeeded in the direction of the Imperial printing office by his pupil, Cazi Ibrahim, who survived his appointment but a short time, and from the period of his decease, 175G, the work was suspended during twenty-seven years.

The work was published with the special permission of a Hatti-sherif from Sultan Mahmoud, in which the reasons of the publication were stated, and permission was granted for its being printed at the Imperial press. The most striking feature in the foregoing catalogue, next to its extreme scantiness (a circumstance, as already remarked, to be partly accounted for by the continual wars aud commotions by which the empire was convulsed during the period it embraces), is the absence of all works of an imaginative and purely literary character. AVe find in it no mention ofthe Divdni, or collections of poetry, which used to form so prominent a feature on Turkish bookshelves. The disposition to give the presci ence tb works of a practical tendency over those of merely literary amusement, formerly so much prized, discovers in a most remarkable manner the direction towards change and progress to which things in Turkey are tending, and in which the Government has long been leading the ed a precious stone of the greatest value belonging to another, yet it is not permitted to open his body in order to recover possession of it.\" The prohibition has been ascribed to the belief that death does not immediately separate the soul from the body, and that certain angels, whose office it is to examine the deceased person after he is placed in the tomb, could not perform their task if the corpse had been mutilated. 8 J.'r.

Bianchi ; he has kindly permitted me to see the MSS., and by com paring it with the catalogues published at Vienna, by Von Hammer, in the ' Asiatic Journal ' (Journal Asia tique), the result gives about one hundred and eight works, chiefly on the same subjects as the preceding. The most notable appear to be an Abridgment of the Annals of the Empire, by Said Effendi, and a Turkish translation of an anonymous drama, called ' Belisarius,' acted at Pera in 1842, and probably the first Turkish attempt at dramatic composition. Since 1843, favoured by the peace and prosperity which (until the recent unhappy events) the empire had enjoyed since the accession of the present Sultan, the number of books annually printed has been gradually increasing. New printing presses have been estab lished at Constantinople, and introduced into the other cities of the empire. The ancient printing-office founded by Selim III. at Scutari has been restored, and the esta blishment of a ' State Gazette ' has necessitated the formation of a new type-foundry, so that works can now be printed by the Imperial presses in all the principal languages of Europe and of the East. Cp to the year 1S50 about one hundred works in foreign languages had issued from the Imperial presses. Turkish literature, which took place about the same time, was an announcement which appeared in some of the papers, of a plan for publishing works by subscription : the first book proposed to be so published was a philological work called Ankudes Senakis, or, 'Blos soms of Grapes.'"], [257, "Letter X. PROGRESS OF PRINTING. 243 There is a separate establishment for the translation and publication of all works, plans, and maps, relating to the theory and practice of the art of war. The idea of this latter establishment originated with the late Sultan Mahmoud. It consists of eight members, who are constantly employed in collecting* and translating the most useful aud valuable works that appear in foreign countries on military subjects. The fruits of their labours during their twenty years of existence at present amount to about thirty volumes. A similar measure has lately been applied to the De partment of Public Instruction, under the auspices of its present intelligent director, Kemal Effendi. From him self I have been informed that, since the re- organization of the schools in 1846, he has directed and superintended the publication of twenty works on education (for the most part translated or taken from the French), of which 75,000 copies have been printed by the lithographic presses at Galata-Serai. This account of Turkish literature would be incomplete without the mention of the great Egyptian printing establishment at Boulak. Founded by Mehemet Ali in 1842, this establishment produced, in the twenty years of which we have any authentic account of its labours,9 two hundred and forty-three works. About forty-five of these are Arabic or Turkish translations of European works, principally produced by the pupils of the Egyptian mis- 9 General Catalogue of Works printed in the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish Languages at the establishment at Boulak in Egypt, by X. \u2014 T.

They embrace a great variety of works on Military, Medical, Scientific, Sanitary, and Agricultural subjects ; some also in the department of general literature. Amongst these may be mentioned Botta's History of Italy ; the Memoirs of ilm Duke of Rovigo ; Voltaire's History of Charles XII. ; an abridgment of Memorials of St. Helena ; and a sketch, very remarkable for the ability with which it is drawn up, of the Formation and Progress of Social Order in Europe} The remainder of the catalogue is composed of original works, comprising Dissertations on Grammar and Lexi cology, and Treatises on Theology and Jurisprudence : these are not numerous in comparison with the works on History, Geography, Politics, and Morals. In one respect this Egyptian catalogue offers a striking contrast to that of the works printed at Constantinople ; for it enumerates several works of a purely literary character, among which we find above twenty Divani, or Poetical Selections from Turkish and Persian poets of ancient and modem times. One cannot but be struck, in perusing this account of the labours of the Egyptian press, with the contrast it offers in other respects to that we have given of the results of the press at Constantinople \u2014 a contrast not advantageous to the latter, and which is the more re markable, because the Periodical Press in Turkey has achieved far greater success than in Egypt. It certainly 1 This sketch was partly compiled, partly translated from different European works on the subject, by the chief of the translating estab lishment at Boulak."], [259, "Letter X. 245 PROGRESS OF PRINTING. is not owing to any want of sincere encouragement on the part of the Sultan's Government, but is thus accounted for by M.

The plan which was unfortunately substituted of send ing a few youths to Paris or London, to live in an isolated manner and without system or guidance to pick up what they could, has proved quite powerless for good, or rather fruitful in evil ; since these youths for the most part return with nothing but a mere smattering of European civiliza tion, or something whicli passes for it \u2014 and of which they have succeeded in acquiring only the vices : \u2014 thus da maging the cause of reform and improvement, by furnish ing fresh weapons to its adversaries."], [260, "Letter XI. 246 LETTERS ON TURKEY. LETTER ELEVENTH. Journalism in Turkey. Earliest attempts at Journalism in Turkey \u2014 The Moniteur Ottoman \u2014 List of the principal Journals and Periodicals published in Con- stantinople and other parts of the empire. The newspaper-press in Turkey owes its creation to a Frenchman, M. Alexandre Blacque, who came to Smyrna in the year 1825, and there established the paper called ' The Eastern Spectator ' (Speetateur de l'Orient). A previous attempt to introduce a newspaper into Turkey had been made by a M Verninhac, who was Envoy Extraordinary from the French Republic to Sultan Selim III. in 1795, and who for some time brought out a Gazette in French, which was printed under his direction at the palace of the French embassy at Pera ; but its pub- lication was soon dropped. In 1811, during the Russian campaign, extracts from the bulletins of the grand army were likewise printed, and distributed at the French embassy on the arrival of every courier. However, the Speetateur de V Orient, which soon assumed the name of 'Courier of Smyrna ' (Con. '-it r de Smyrne), was the first regular periodical and political paper that was estab- lished in Turkey, and under the latter title it exercised, from 1825 to 1828, an important influence upon the cir cumstances which attended the termination of the Greek revolution. Whilst the whole of the European press, under the"], [261, "Letter XI. JOURNALISM IN TURKEY. 247 spell of a blind enthusiasm, were furiously applauding the recent declaration of Greek independence, and sum moning the whole world to join in a crusade against the Turks, ' The Courier of Smyrna ' alone defended the rights and interests of the Porte, and by its vigorous attacks upon the Hellenic government of that day pro bably contributed, in no slight degree, to the fall of Capo d'lstrias. In 1831, M. Blacque, summoned to Constantinople by the Sultan Mahmoud, established in that city the ' Moni teur Ottoman,' the official journal of the Porte, published in French. In the following year appeared the Takvimi vi, or Table of Events, which was little else than a reproduction in Turkish of the ' Moniteur Ottoman,' with this difference, however, that the ' Takvimi ' was confined, as is still the case, to the publication of decrees and acts of the Government ; while the ' Moniteur Otto man,' besides its official columns, contained others open to non-official and general matter, and to the discussion and defence of the interests of the Porte. Great atten tion was bestowed on the careful editing of the ' Takvimi Vakai,' for which a special staff of functionaries, an nexed to the department of the Imperial Historiographer and placed under his immediate superintendence, was appointed. These beginnings of Journabsm in Turkey at first passed unregarded, or were considered as abortive efforts which would quickly expire of themselves ; but when it was seen that they daily grew in strength and import ance, and were taking a firm root in the country, great. uneasiness began to manifest itself amongst the Eu-"], [262, "I ETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter XI, 248 ropean missions and embassies at Pera ; partly from the dislike with which every tendency to Turkish reform and improvement was beheld by certain parties \u2014 partly from tbe jealousy which these missions always entertained of each other's influence, and which on the present occasion they united in entertaining towards that of France. Secret intrigue and open opposition were employed to crush and annihilate the rising innovation Some even, affecting a display of alarm and uneasiness for the conse quences to the Turkish Government, addressed notes of warning and remonstrance to the Porte ; but happily in this instance, the Sultan Mahmoud, relying on his own strength, turned a deaf ear to the representations of his European friends, and his determined and energetic pro tection enabled the 'Moniteur Ottoman' to struggle on, and finally to establish itself, in spite of the snares and difficulties diligently spread in its path by the European legations. In 1836 M. Blacque died suddenly at Malta, on his way to France on a confidential mission from the Sultan : and it was remarked at the time, as a singular coincidence, that the two persons who after his death successively undertook the management of the paper each came to a similar end within the very short period of two years.1 Common report, always eager for the marvellous, did not fail to ascribe to political intrigue a mysterious 1 These two persons were a M.

After these disasters the ' Moniteur Ottoman ' still continued to exist for a few years, when its place was taken by the Djeredei Havadissi,2 and the Takvimi Vagai (Table of Events) became the only official paper. M. Blacque, on giving up the ' Smyrna Courier,' made it over to another Frenchman, M. Bouquet Deschamps, who changed its title to that of Journal de Smyrne (the 'Smyrna Journal') ; Smyrna, which had been the first Turkish city that possessed a newspaper, soon boasted of five. The second paper established in Smyrna was ' L'Echo de V Orient\" ('Echo of the East'), also published in French. It was founded in 1 838 by M. Bargigli, Consul- General of Tuscany, and subsequently passed into the hands of a French merchant named Couturier. Some time afterwards Mr. Edwards, formerly a colleague of M. Deschamps in the 'Journal de Smyrne,' founded a third paper, called the ' Impartial ' of Smyrna, which was ..published at first in English, afterwards in French. The ' Impartial ' is the only one of the three papers published in French at Smyrna which has maintained its ground. The two others have been successively transferred to Constantinople, where they have been united in one, and now appear every five days under the title of Journal de Constantinople, Echo de l'Orient (' Constantinople Jour nal and Echo of the East '). On the other hand, several new Journals have sprung up in Smyrna. Two of these, 1 Register of News. M 3"], [264, "Letter XI.

At Constantinople the number of newspapers has been progressively increasing, as new ideas and fresh interests have sprung up and developed themselves in the country. The Government has always been forward in encouraging this movement, so that at the present day there are no less than thirteen newspapers and other Periodicals pub lished at Constantinople in the various languages and dialects of the empire. The following is a list of these publications : \u2014 Two Newspapers in the Turkish language, viz. the Takvimi Vakai, or ' State Gazette,' a weekly paper, and the official organ of the Government.

In the former case they were declared to be Titheahle or decimal estates (Arzi Aschriie), i. e. subject to a tax of one-tenth of their produce ; in the latter they were said to be Tributary, i. e. lands subjected to the payment of tribute called Kharadj, consisting of a double tax : the Personal or capitation tax, and the Manorial tax, which might be laid either on the soil or the produce. This distinction, established and consecrated by the unanimous decisions of lawyers and by the Kanoun nameh of sovereigns, is thus expressed in the Fetvah of the Mufti Abou-Sououd Effendi : \u2014 - Question- \" What is, according to law, the distinction between Titheable and Tributary land ?

But when the ancient possessors, though they remain infidels, are still allowed to retain their property, it must be on condition of their paying the tribute (Kha radj). A religious meaning is attached to the word Aschr, which excludes its application to infidels. The tribute is levied either on the soil (Muwasef), or on produce (Mukassemeh). The former is estimated according to the extent of land, the latter according to its fertility, and may amount to from one-eighth to one-half of the produce ; this is the division of lands as laid down in the books of law.\""], [270, "LETTERS ON TURKEY.

Wheu a man died without heirs the Sipahi was obliged togive the lands he had occupied to one of his neighbours. The Sipahi was bound to reside on his fief under pain of forfeiture. He was entitled to receive iktaa, the rent of the land, i. e. a part or the whole of the impost which it was bound to pay ; but he was by no means the pos sessor of the land, which remained in the hands of the State.2 The fiefs thus constituted were divided into three classes, according to their extent : the Beyliks, the Ziamets, and the Timars.

The State, or, to speak more precisely, the Public Treasury, had always been regarded as the real and sole proprietor of the soil, though it had retained the manage ment of one only ofthe three great divisions in its own hands. The cultivator, whether Musulman or Christian, and even the Mosque itself, had only the usufruct and not the fee simple ofthe land, the latter remaining exclusively with the Miri. Even the Miri, however, was ouly the nominal and conditional proprietor, forthe real and absolute ownership of the soil of the country, as well as the sovereignty over the people, belongs, according to the Koran, to God, who, according to His Almighty will and pleasure, intrusts cer tain portions of land and certain attributes of sovereignty to men. Apart from this legal distinction or fiction, the tenure of land differed little in Turkey from that which existed in Europe. Such is the principle which originally obtained with regard to land under cultivation. The waste and unen closed lands (adiyet or mouaei), which had not been in cluded in the partition at the time of the conquest, or such as through the neglect of the occupants had been suffered to lie fallow, became the property of any indi vidual, Musulman or otherwise, who, to borrow the expres sion of the law, restored their soul to them.

VACOUFS. 259 The above-described organisation lasted till the reign of the late Sultan Mahmoud, when, the basis of the admi nistrative and military system of Turkey being entirely changed, the fiefs of every description, Arpalyks, Appan ages, &c, reverted to the Miri or Public Treasury, which from that time has provided for the expenses of the Civil List as well as for the pay and maintenance of the army. Mattel's then returned to the same state as at the period of the original territorial division, except that the relative proportion between the three classes was no longer the same. The Domain had neither lost nor gained, but the number and extent of the patrimonial lands had suffered considerable diminution, whilst the property ofthe Mosques had, by reason ofthe Vacouf system, increased in the same proportion. This system, which has been several times referred to in the course of these letters, demands a more particular explanation. The Vakf or Vacouf is a peculiar description of pro perty existing in Turkey. The term is exclusively appli cable to property devoted to Mosques and other pious foundations, and is opposed to the term Mulk, which signifies property that is alienable and transmissible at will. Originally this term Vacouf was appropriated to the portion of territory assigned to the Mosques in the legal division of the conquered lands : subsequently the same de signation was extended to all donations made to Mosques for the purposes of keeping them in repair, and of defray ing the expenses of their support and of religious worship. unreclaimed spaces, which remain untilled for want of hands, and which only want agricultural skill to become covered with the finest crops."], [274, "Letter XII. 260 LETTERS ON TURKEY. All Vacouf property was declared unalienable, the pos session of it being considered, according to the principle of the law, to be transferred to God. For the same reason it was free from taxation, confiscation, and all judicial proceedings. Nevertheless the fundamental prin ciple of the Law in Turkey, namely, that the State is the sole proprietor of the land, was held to remai changed, since the Vacouf does not consist in the land itself, but in its produce. At a later date a second class of Vacoufs was formed, the revenues of which were applied to the foundation and support of various establishments for objects of charity and public utility connected with the Mosques, and placed in dependence, as for instance mudiresehs, libraries, baths, hospitals, imarets, &c. &c. The revenues of this c Vacoufs also furnish pensions to superannuated func tionaries of religious worship, and contributions towards the support of some ofthe orders of Dervishes. A third class of Vacoufs, called Aadet or \" Custom took their rise at the time when little security for private property existed in Turkey : and the continual exactions of the Government and its agents led to the introduction of these Vacoufs, which have proved extremely injurious to the Treasury. By this system the owner of an unencum bered estate may nominally cede it to a Mosque, as a Vacouf, for a sum of ten or fifteen per cent, on the esti mated value ; whilst at the same time he retains the enjoyment of it, and the power of transmitting it to his ndants in the direct line, on condition of paying during his lifetime an annual rent to the Mosque equiva lent to the annual interest of the sum he has received."], [275, "letter XU, VACOUFS. 261 Let us endeavour to make this clearer by an example. Suppose Zenl to pos?ess a property worth 100,000 piastres, which he desires to secure against the rapacity of the Government ( I am supposing a time which happily no longer exists in Turkey), and to transmit to his heirs and descendants. In the first place he cedes it to the Mosque, and receives as the price a sum of 10,000 piastres. This surrender is, however, fictitious ; in reality Zeid pays the Mosque an annual interest of 15 per cent on the 10,000 piastres received, and retains his property, with the power of handing it down to his children after his decease, or disposing of it during his lifetime to another person, paying on this last transaction a duty to the Mosque of 3 per cent. Zeid has thus acquired the privilege of protection against confiscation and com pulsory sales. But suppose Zeid to survive his children or to die without issue, the property would fall to the Mosque, in obedience to a Fetvah already mentioned, which declares that, where a man dies before his father, his children are not entitled to inherit from their grand father.5 Thus the Mosque eventually becomes possessed of the estate for about one-tenth of its real value, having in the mean time derived from it an annual revenue of ten to fifteen per cent, on the purchase-money. The system has gradually extended, until at the present day about three fourths of the territorial property in Turkey is mortgaged in this manner to the Mosques, to the great detriment of the State and the Treasury. 5 See Letter IV., p. 75."], [276, "Letter XII. 262 LETTERS ON TURKEY. These Vacoufs are styled Customary (Aadet), or sanc tioned by custom, in order to distinguish them from the former, which are called Legal, having been originally set apart by the Law for religious and pious uses. Formerly the administration of the revenues of each Vacouf was intrusted to a functionary appointed by the founder of the Vacouf in his deed of gift, and called a Mut a velly or Registrar. After his death his successors were appointed by the Cazi-askers of Roumelia or Anatolia.

He at the same time decreed that the power of issuing the Bairats, or Cre dentials of the Mutavellies, should belong henceforth to the Board of Direction of the Vacoufs, and that no Bairats should be granted until after the candidates had under gone a proper examination.8 It was even at one time proposed to annex the Vacoufs to the public Domain, as had been already done with the Timars and other military Fiefs ; but religious scruples, or an apprehension of dangerous consequences, arrested this measure, and the Government forbore to touch the revenue of the Mosques, contenting itself with controlling and regulating their application. But in order to check the increasing number of the Aadet or Customary Vacoufs, the office for confiscations (Mukhallefat Khalemi) was also abolished.9 The above measures, excellent in themselves as far as they have gone, have no doubt contributed to lessen and remove many of the ancient abuses, though much still remains to be done ; but so far from promoting the grand desideratum, the enriching the Treasury, they have proved the means of encumbering it with an additional burthen of twelve million five hundred thousand piastres (125,000Z.) per annum, which the State now pays to the Board of Administration of the Vacoufs, in order to make up the balance, between its receipts and disbursements.

Meanwhile let us remind the reader that one unalter able universal principle, regarding the proprietorship of the soil and the nature of tribute and taxation, charac terises the Mahometan law and prevails throughout Turkey and all Musulman states, namely, that the fee simple of land belongs to the State alone, whilst the occupiers and cultivators are regarded as possessing only a life interest in the property which they occupy or cul tivate. The produce alone belongs to them, the soil itself is considered as merely hired out or lent. The Musulman and the Infidel are in this respect in the same position \u2014 the tax, tribute, or contribution which they severally pay to the State being looked upon as a sort of rent for the land which they use and occupy by permission of the State as nominal pro prietors. The religious establishments of the country, and even the Sovereign himself, are in a similar position The privileges of the former, conferred by the Vacouf, apply to the produce of the land, and not to the land itself ; and the latter has no power to alienate the soil of the country either by sale, gift, or grant.

Tithes, legally speaking, are not a tax, but a quit-rent re ceived by the State, as the landowner, from the tenant. Tliis rent is of two kinds, according to the two species of productions obtained by agricultural industry, namely, the tithe of the different productions of the soil (uchur), and that upon cattle. The former is levied on all the produce of the earth, both cereals and fruit; the latter on all animals connected with rural economy, such as sheep, pigs, bees, &c. ; horses and horned cattle are excepted. This is peculiar to Boumelia and certain dis tricts of Asiatic Turkey ; in the other parts of the empire the inhabitants are subjected to a higher tax to make up for the indemnity. Vergu. The Vergn corresponds to our income-tax. It is a tax raised on the presumed fortune of all private persons. This tax is not uniform : in Roumelia it does not amount to more than 10 per cent. ; in some districts of Anatolia it rises to 25 or 30 per cent. This inequality may be explained in the following manner : \u2014 As the revenue may be composed of taxes on objects already subjected to tithe, as cereals, olives, flocks, &c, it often happens that the same object is subject to both these taxes. For instance, on a crop representing a value of 1000 piastres the Government first takes 100 under the head of tithe, and then 175 on an average under the n 2"], [282, "XIII. 268 LETTERS ON TURKLY. head of Vergu ; while for a house representing a similar value only 175 would be paid under the head of income-tax. All houses belonging to the Vacoufs are exempt from taxation, because they are applied, or supposed to be applied, to religious purposes.2 The levying of the Vergu, the amount of which is fixed by the superior authorities of the empire, is effected through the medium of the municipalities which ha^e ex isted throughout Turkey from time immemorial, and which hand over the produce to the agents of the Government. In agricultural localities the distribution is regulated by the number of ploughs ; public notoriety serves to estimate the fortunes of individuals who are engaged in trade or commerce. 8 Estates annexed to the church in land and houses, either in actual -ion or in reversion, arc held most sacred and inviolable: those persons, therefore, who give their possessions, by whatever means ac quired, in reversion to religious foundations, transmit them *. alienation or molestation to their direct malt - and Medina are usuaUy preferred as being the most sacred. This settlement is called Vacouf; it pays a very trifling quit-rent until the extinction of the founder's issue, when the whole devolves tothe religious foundation on which it was settled. This previous law, or tie of religion, is of so great force that there never has been an instance, even on the part ofthe most te aud tyrannical monarch, of any attempt to violate or i i even in instances where a settlement under this law deprives him of the right of inheriting in particular cases the possessions of his own - and subjects. Mohaintned did not limit this law of security exclusively to b follower*; it extends to those of all religions, and Christians and Jews are free to avail themselves of it. The Jews, indeed, have been excluded fl orne ofthe Mosques, as it appeared by the registers that in the space of a century not a single reversion fell in; whence perhaps it was concluded that the direct male issue ofthe sous of Abraham is eternal. y, by Sir James Porter. \u2014 T."], [283, "Letter XIII. 269 DIRECT TAXES. By virtue of very ancient privileges Constantinople and its precincts are exempted from the payment of the Vergu. Capitation-Tax (Kharadj). The Kharadj is of two kinds: the first is a voluntary tribute which a Christian country at peace with the Porte has engaged to pay while submitting voluntarily to its power. Such is the tribute paid by the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, and the apportioning of which among the inhabitants was intrusted to the Princes or Hospodars, who were answerable to the Porte for the annual payment of the whole amount agreed upon. The other is the Capitation or Poll tax, which affects every Raiah or non-Musulman subject in the Sultan's dominions. According to a Ferman issued by the late Sultan Mah moud in the month of April, 1834, the Kharadj was fixed at fifteen, thirty, or sixty piastres annually per head, proportionally to the fortunes of the payers, and is levied on every male adult Raiah; women, children, aliens, sick and infirm persons, the poor, and priests of all confessions, being exempted. Taking into account these exemptions, and calculating the average contribution of each remaining individual at 25 piastres per head, the gross annual amount of the Kharadj being computed at 40 millions, let us divide that amount by 25, and the result will be 1,600,000, as the number of taxable Ra'iahs in Turkey, actual contributors to the Kharadj, leaving 7,400,000 as the number of the rest ; and giving a total of 9 millions of individuals of both sexes and all ages who compose the Raiah population subject to the Sultan\u2014 an estimate which agrees pretty exactly with that given in the"], [284, "Letter XIII. 270 LETTERS OX TURKEY. early part of this volume. Nor does any material change appear to have taken place since the fifteenth century, for in a learned work by a French author of that day we find the following note : \u2014 \" A census was made at the time of Sultan Bajazet ; there were found under his rule one million one hundred and ten thousand Christians paying tribute, not reckoning the other Christians who are his vassals, nor the chUdren of the Christians who are young and not yet of a proper age to pay the tribute.''3 The mode of apportioning and levying the Kht has undergone many variations. It was formerly collected mts called Kolcljis, whose proceedings were always more or less arbitrary. Systems of registration are unknown to Turkish authorities, and the registers of non-Musulman municipalities are unrecognised by them ; they therefore han recourse to a singular method of ascertaining whether the Raiah youths had attained the tax-paying* age pre scribed by law. They took the measure of a lad's neck with a piece of cord, made him hold both ends between his teeth, and then try to pass his head through the circle thus formed. If the operation was accomplished without difficulty the boy was declared liable to the lowest rate of taxation, which was thenceforward gradu ally increased till it reached the amount beyond winch no augmentation was lawful.4 The Ferman of 1834, already mentioned, by intrusting the collecting of the Kharadj to a commission composed of the authorities of each dis- 3 Rigaud, ' La Gene'alogie du Grand Turc, et la Oignite des Offices et Ordres de sa Cour,' &c.

In 1850 the present Sultan completed the measures of his predecessor by the publication of a new decree ordaining that, for the future, the heads of the different communities, both Jewish and Christian, ; shoidd be the sole agents between their co-religionists and the exchequer, for the collection and payment of the Kharadj. ' Thus the tribute has not only been lightened, but its very nature has become gradually modified, and a great relief has been afforded to the Christians. Originally the Kharadj was imposed on the conquered as a pecuniary penalty, substituted in lieu of captivity or death, to which the law of Islam declared all is liable who should reject its doctrines or resist its arms. The humiliating features which once rendered this tax so peculiarly odious to the Ra'iahs have now disap peared, and it has come to be regarded on all hands (a circumstance to which we desire to call particularly the attention of the reader) as an equivalent for the conscrip tion to which Musulmans only are subject.

The most important are in Asia Minor, in the Eyalets of Trebi zond and Erzeroum. Their annual value is estimated at about 160,000/., of which five-eighths revert to the Exchequer, according to the laws regulating mining pro perty in Turkey. According to these laws, all subjects of the Ottoman empire, without distinction of religion or race, are at liberty to work mines ; but this right is re fused to foreigners. Whoever discovers and wishes to work a vein of metal must request a concession from Government. The grant obtained is generally for a term of which the minimum is ten, the maximum twenty years. These concessions oblige the payment to Go vernment of 20 per cent, of the proceeds of the mine, and the delivering to the constituted authorities the entire amount of the ore obtained ; private persons being strictly forbidden to carry on operations of metallurgy*. The Government claims the exclusive right to carry on opera tions of this nature, of which it also defiays the expense.

The land posts (Kara Postalari) are forwarded by couriers on horseback called Tatars ; a national name having become a technical one, from the ancient practice of employing Tartars as messengers. The couriers follow certain main lines, which proceed from Constantinople to the extreme limits of the empire, being joined at various points by different branch-lines. Post-houses, with relays, are found on each of these lines, about six or seven hours apart. After reaching the terminus of the main lines, the mails, &c, are forwarded to their destination by private couriers.

Any private person can, by paying the price fixed by the tariff, obtain at the post-house the services of one or more Tatars for his own use. The rate of postage is fixed for letters under a certain weight9 at one para for every hour. Tlie para is the fortieth part of a piastre, and is equal to rather more than half a centime, French money. According to this rate, a leiter from Constantinople to Adrianople, the distance between the two towns being 44 horns, would cost one piastre and four paras, or about 2id. of our money. Newspapers and printed or written books may also be sent by post at a very trifling expense. Everything must be prepaid.

Tne Company9 to which these different lines of steamers belong, and by which they are worked, receives no sub vention from the State. But the Government, being very friendly to the undertaking, often lends indirect assistance by allowing the Company the free use of the imperial dockyards and stores, furnishing them with fuel, and occasionally with hands if they are in need. On the other hand, if the Government requires the temporary use of one or two steamers, the Company are always ready to place some of theirs at its disposal.1 Collection of the Taxes. We have now stated the principal sources which com pose the PubHc Revenue of Turkey. As the majority of these contributions are raised in kind, the Government was naturally led to resort to the ruinous system of farming the taxes (iltizam), in lieu of the direct method of collecting them.

Each of these branches was divided into a number of different lots, which, being separately leased out to powerful pashas and functionaries of state, soon became in their hands so many oppressive monopolies. In tbe time of D'Ohsson twenty-two Sandjaks were leased for life to Governors, who underlet them to officers bearing the titles of Vaivode, Nazir, Mou hassil, Agha, &c.s Three Eyalets were let in the same way to Pashas. At a period when the power of the Pashas was unlimited, and when a separation of Financial Adminis tration and Military authorities, such as exists at present; was not even dreamed of, it may be imagined how many vexations and abuses must have arisen from a monopoly of this nature, especially for the wretched Ra'iahs \u2014 all 2 It is curious to note, in the preamble to that Edict, the striking description of the depopulation and ruin produced in most of the pro vinces by the system of the Moukatas, or annual leasing. 3 \" Those who are directly employed in the Sultan's service, and those less immediately so \u2014 as, for instance, the Pashas in distant pro vinces \u2014 know that they hold their offices on a kind of feudal tenure ; they nevertheless are ready to accept, nay, eagerly solicit them, on this condition \u2014 that the sovereign shall inherit all their goods and fortune at their death.

In fact, the Fanners-general, or holders of Malikianes, being bound to pay the amount beforehand into the Miri (Exchequer), or to find security, the majority of the Pashas, who wished to farm portions of the Revenue or particular districts, were obliged to have recourse to the Armenians, who advanced them the necessary funds, and then took part in grinding the people. Thus the Empire was given up to a body of plunderers composed of the high Turkish functionaries and the Armenian Sarrafs ; and whilst the population were burthened and ground down by every species of oppressive exaction, a very small portion ofthe money drained from them found its way into the Miri or Imperial Treasury, hut a vast system of spoliation was fast hurrying on the state to the verge of ruin.4 Sultan Selim was the first who endeavoured to remedy these abuses, and to increase the receipts of the treasury by subjecting the Government fanners to a new system of Government control. After him, Sultan Mahmeiud (to whom may be applied the noble eulogium which Tacitus passes on Vespasian, \" Nil boni intentatum rdi] having, in the first place, resumed the Timars 5 into the possession of the State, issued a decree ordering the Pashas henceforth to administer their Pashaliks for the benefit of the State, and not for their own private emolu ment.

The con clusion of the Hatti-sherif declared that the Council of Justice would assemble without delay to settle this ques tion. But in the mean while the old system continued, the principal functionaries of government were still seen outbidding each other, and constantly becoming farmers of the revenue, either in their own name or in that of the Sarrafs. The fatal results of this system were attempteel to be modified by the adoption of certain measures, by which the rights of the State and those of the individual should be maintained : amongst these were the separation of the administrative, financial, and military functions previously united in the hands of one person ; the appointment of special agents for receiving the revenue ; the extension of power granted to the municipalities ; the establishment of Provincial Councils for the collecting and administration of the revenue. But notwithstanding these wise measures, the State continued to be robbed, the population to be ground and fleeced, and the deficit of the Exchequer, instead of diminishing, increased. Two years ago the committee appointed to examine into the different questions relating to finances, decided, as a principle, that no Agent or Employe of the Government should for the future obtain leases, and that those who acquired them in the name of other parties should be"], [296, "282 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

But laws are useless if not enforced; and besides, this enactment touches only a small part of the question ; it will not suffice to put an end merely to a disgraceful system of trafficking, which is equally rain ous and dishonourable to the country ; nor even to regu late and insure the due collection of the Revenue, unless the nature and character of the taxes themselves be changed and modified.8 6 Take the following facts as illustrations. The writer, II. Cor, is a merchant settled in Turkey : \u2014 \" Some years ago the Customs in the town of B were let out for 600,000 piastres ; but the imports have gradually increased to such an extent that this grant has steadily risen to 1,500,000 piastres. The receiver of customs, who the year before had received it at this price, confesses that he has cleared a net profit of 1,000,000 piastres. He was disposed to undertake it, this year, for the sum of 2,5 piastres. ' ' A functionary of the government had it knocked down to him for His name does not figure in the ferman, one of his servants answering as a blind by lending bis name. \"As this official wished immediately to realise a profit, he had deal ings with some Armeniau bankers, and he negotiated with them for the sum of 2,500,000 piastres, in consideration of which they incur all risks in his stead.\" Here we have then 800,000 piastres which may be viewed aa taken out of the pocket of the government. When I add that the pettiest agent of these speculators makes his fortune in one year, you will have some idea of the enormous sums which are embezzled to their profit. The following circumstance occurred in the same province at the time of the sale of tithes in the present year : \u2014 \" The number of bidders was considerable, and an advantageous trans mission to the treasury was anticipated. But on this occasion the grant fell to the share of the wealthiest and not of the highest bidder. \" The successful candidate, N , who has enjoyed its monopoly for five or six years, has managed to retain it this year also, owing to the influence that he has acquired, and, to his immense fortune, whereof the amount exactly represents the losses experienced by the treasury. \" A few days before the auction he mentioned quite publicly, and caused to be announced by his numerous agents, the names of the vii-"], [297, "Letter XIII.

The same evening his customers went to N , and then the latter proceeded to subsell by auction and to his own profit and in detail the concession which had been granted to him in a lump in the morning. Last year the same trick brought him in a gain of 1,500,000 piastres by the subselling of about i,000 tithes. \" The local authorities are aware of this, but N \u2022 is neither a foe to be defied, nor a friend to be despised.

He owes the treasury several millions. He pays a portion of it, but at the end of he either pretends a failure, or he alleges disastrous circum stances, obstructions on the part of the authorities, and even accuses some measures adopted by the government.

THE CIVIL LIST. 285 The Sultan's Civil List. The Sultan formerly possessed a private revenue dis tinct from the Miri, or Treasury of the Empire, and derived from various sources set apart for the purpose. TTiese consisted principally of the Imperial domains, gardens, and residences ; the revenues of the Woods and Forests, which were farmed out ; a portion of the Egyptian Tribute ; fees paid by Pashas and other great functionaries on receiving offices or employments ; a royalty of ten per cent, on all legacies ; taxes paid by certain provinces for the Sultan's special use ; confiscated property ; the pre sents sent by foreign potentates, as well as those offered by the grandees of the Empire on particular occasions ; the right formerly enjoyed by the Sultans of inheriting the property of the servants of the Crown. These persons were considered to stand in the situation of slaves to the Sultan (many of them literally being so), and therefore incapable of possessing independent property.1 It is extremely difficult, to form a conect estimate of the amount of all these sources of revenue, which appears 1 By the ancient laws of the empire the officers of the Seraglio were the Sultan's slaves, and to whatever rank they attained were still con sidered to exist in that relation, and to be disqualified from acquiring independent property, their wives, children, and fortune, as well as themselves, being at the absolute disposal of their master. In process of time this principle became practically modified; the Household offi cers and Grandees of the empire were often men who had never been but still the original notion continued to operate. The func tionary who displeased the sovereign was put to death, and his property taken possession of, until the reign of Mahmoud, who, making a personal sacrifice both of power and emolument, abandoned the title of the Sultan to inherit the property of his servants, and thus removed a great temptation to put men to an unjust death from sordid motives."], [300, "286 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

We have already seen that, although nominally pos- sessed of three-fourths of the landed property in the Turkish empire, the revenue of the administration of Va- coufs does not exceed 20,000,000 of piastres. This ap- parent contradiction is explained by the usual frauds in the price of sales, &o., and more particularly by the low amount of the quit-rents originally stipulated for in a coin the denomination of which remains unchanged, though its value is depreciated to thirty or forty times below its original value. Suppose, for instance, the quit-rent of a house to have been originally settled at eight piastres a year at a time when that coin was worth about 7s. 6d. Enghsh, the same quit-rent of eight piastres would con- tinue to be paid at the present day, though the piastre is now worth about 2 id. This fact, strange as it appears, and caused by the ruinous depreciation of the coinage, is not the least curious among those which deserve notice as showing to what a scrupulous length legality is pushed in Turkey. Thus, from one cause or another, the revenues of administration of Vacoufs not being sufficient to cover their outgoings, the State has been compelled to grant a subvention amounting to 12,500,000 piastres. This subvention, added to the 20,000,000 arising from the Vacoufs themselves, represents the total disbursements for rehgion, education, and institutions of public utility and charity in Turkey. The smallness of this amount, compared with the expen diture for the same purposes in most European countries, and when we consider the immense number of mosques"], [310, "Letter XIV. 296 LETTERS ON TURKEY. generally met with in Turkish towns, strikes us as very remarkable, and shows, in the first place, that the officiat ing ministers of religion, the Imaums, must be poorly paid ; and in the second, that Turkey, however backward she may be in the career of European civibzation, is at least exempt from the crying evil of pauperism, which serins ito inevitable attendant. In Turkey, where the public contribute very little to the rehef of the indigent, there is not a single pauper. Life Annuities paid by the Treasuey. The fiefs, in heu of which these Annuities are granted, were of two sorts \u2014 the military fief s, and the Monquatas and Malikianelis, which consisted in the privileges en joyed by particular families of receiving directly and for their own benefit the revenue raised from a certain village or district. The abolition of the former naturally resulted from the destruction of the Janissaries and the suppression of the Sipahis and feudal militia by Sultan Mahmoud, and the substitution in their stead of bodies of regular troops raised and paid by the State. Several causes, however, retarded the complete execution of this great measure till 1840. At that period, when the definitive organiza tion of the army was commenced, the Ottoman Govern ment resolved to receive on its own accomit the revenues of these military fiefs, and, instead of the armed con tingent which they had hitherto been bound to furnish, to establish a regular system of recruiting. All fiefs, civil as well as military, were at the same time abolished, the Government indemnifying the holders by granting"], [311, "Lrttei SUBVENTION TO OTTOMAN BANK. 297 them half the revenue of the fief in the shape of an annuity. The amount of these annuities or pensions may, at the present time, be about forty millions of piastres ; but it is continually diminishing, and in the course of a very few years will have disappeared altogether from the budget. There is another variety of life annuities, which may be explained as follows.3 By the Sehim (portion of the body) certain annuities are designated, which are transmissible in the same way as the Vacouf property, and which lapsed to the Treasury when the annuitants happened to die without direct heirs.

An Ottoman Bank, organized upon the same principle as the public banks of Europe, was estabhshed in Con stantinople by imperial ferman, April 5th, 1853.

To maintain the exchange on Europe at a mini mum of 110 piastres for one pound sterling in commercial transactions. It will be necessary, in order to comprehend the cir cumstances which rendered the establishment of the Bank of vital importance to Turkey, to make a retrospect of a few years. It had been the unfortunate policy of the Ottoman Sultans, whenever they found themselves in any financial difficulty, to have recourse to the fatal practice of de teriorating the coinage, retaining its nominal value. The most important of these depreciations occurred in 1774, isequence of the Peace of Kainardj,4 so disastrous to Turkey, when the value of the gourouch, Tinkish piastre, which had been equal to 4s. 4d., was suddenly reduced to 2s. 2d. Since that period the depreciation gradually continued, until in 182'.', when a new* coin, called a beschlik,b containing 5 piastres, was struck, for the purpose of paying the indemnity6 to the Russians, the real value of the piastre had fallen to less thau two pence of our money. About the same time the first Treasury bonds (Kaimehs) were issued ; their value was from 50 to 1000 piastres. They had no fixed time of *\u2022 By a separate article of the Treaty of Kainardj the Porte engaged to pay Russia a war-indemnity of 7,500,000 piastres \u2014 in Rus.*:an money 10 roubles. signifying in Turkish five. 6 This indemnity was claimed for the expenses of the war and the :. -ustained by Russian merchants and subjects in Turkey."], [313, "Letter XIV. \".

The first issue of these bonds took place in 1841 ; the Government, cautious of arousing opposition, proceeded with its usual circumspection in the introduction of this new kind of paper-money, and the amount of the kaimehs first cir culated did not exceed 60,000,000 of piastres (about 552,000?.), bearing a yearly interest of 12 per cent., payable half-yearly. This rate of interest, though ruinous to the State, was in accordance with the ordinary rate in Turkey, and can scarcely be deemed too high when we take into account the risks to which the holders of the kaimehs were ex posed by reason of tbe indefinite period of the repayment, and the total absence of guarantee on the part of the State. In the following year, however, Izzet Pasha, Minister of Finance, reduced the interest to 6 per cent., repaying a portion of the bonds issued in 1841. Since then new bonds, of which some bear the same rate of 6 per cent., and others bearing no interest, have increased the circu lation to about 1 76,000,000 of piastres ; but notwith standing the exactitude with which the interest was paid half-yearly, the kaimehs underwent the considerable depreciation of 3 per cent. That tliis depreciation was not still greater may be ascribed to the Government undertaking to exchange them at sight at a loss of 3 per cent. The new coinage of beschliks multiplied more rapidly than the kaimehs, and in a short time more than"], [314, "300 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter XIV. 500,000,000 of piastres of this coinage were in circula tion, a fourth part of which was supposed to have been imported from Europe. The evils and abuses resulting from this system were not confined to Turkey ; they affected the European commerce at Constantinople and throughout the Levant, and produced continual frauds and losses from the unsettled state of the exchanges. During the latter years of the late Sultan's reign several attempts were made to put a stop to these evils and attain a fixed rate of exchange, by preventing the depreciation of the coinage ; but nothing effectual was accomplished until the year 1844, when the Bank of Constantinople was established. The debased money then in circulation was gradually withdrawn at the rate of 7,500,000 piastres per annum, and replaced by a new coinage of a standard corre sponding to European money. The new coinage was composed of ten varieties of pieces, called Medjidieh, after the name of the reigning Sultan. The total value of the money struck since the year 1844 is estimated at about 200,000,000 of piastres. The following is a table of the new coins : \u2014 Gold.

Lette, decree, renewing and enforcing the former prohibition, under a heavy penalty ; and at the same time arrange ments were entered into with the heads of the principal mercantile houses in Constantinople, by which, the pound sterling being fixed at 110 piastres, they engaged to furnish merchants at this price with the bills they re quired to carry on their foreign business. Still, however, this being, after all, but a private speculation, did not appear to furnish all the desired securities for stability. For this reason the Ottoman Government, instructed by the experience of several years and by the results of a system of which it daily per ceived more clearly the advantages, determined on con solidating and giving stability to its work by taking the business into its own hands. Thus in 1848 originated the first Imperial Bank of Constantinople ; its capital on starting was 25,000,000 of piastres ; its first directors Messrs. James Allen and Emanuel Baltazzi. According to the statement published by authority in the month of February, 1851, the number of bills issued from 1848 to 1850, a period of two years, was as follows : \u2014 On London to the amount of . . 635,479,016 pi On Marseilles aud France in general 168, '-\"25, 151 On Vienna 6,5.v 1, 560 piastres.

Thus the bank was reduced to periodical losses ; obliged to buy new"], [317, "Letter XIV. THE OTTOMAN BANK. 303 Turkish and European money at a very high price, and bound by its statutes to issue bills at a lower rate. From this and various other causes the first Ottoman bank proved a ruinous speculation, and was compelled in 1852 to wind up its affairs with a deficit of 35,000,000 of piastre--. This was not all. Though the bank had only been established to furnish bills to merchants for payment in Europe-, matters came to such a pass, that it proceeded at length to buy up its own bills of exchange. For exam ple : some merchants took letters of exchange for very large sums at the bank, without having to pay anything in Em-ope. The bank, when it wanted specie to send to Europe for the payment of its bills, asked for paper notes from the merchants of Constantinople, who gave it, en dorsed by themselves, its own bills of exchange, which it repurchased at an increase of from 2 to 4 per cent. Operations of this kind would have ruined most insti tutions. The Government had to meet the deficit of 35,000,000, and find another means of maintaining the exchange with Europe, whilst restoring the balance of its budget. A loan was decided upon : it failed, partly from the fault of the negotiators, who exceeded their instruc tions, and a society was formed to establish a new bank, styled the Ottoman Bank. Its statutes, forming thirty-nine articles, have been published, and sanctioned by the Sultan. We can only give a very brief analysis of this institu tion : \u2014 The bank is founded with authority, and by shares of 2000 piastres each, the capital being 200,000 piastres."], [318, "304 Letter XIV. LETTERS ON TURKEY. Its duration is fixed at fifteen years. At the expiration of this term it will have the power of prolonging its existence for ten years, without, however, any grant from Government. Its chief aim is to regulate the circulation of money, by withdrawing the base coin, and substituting coin of good alloy in their stead. It engages, moreover, to maintain the kaimehs bearing interest, and now in circula tion, at par. At the end of the fifteen years, all these kaimehs, after being paid off, will be restored by the bank to the state, without interest. As regards the kaimehs in circulation without interest, the bank will receive them, and maintain them at par to the amount of one-third of its payments or of its receipts. The other principal operations of the Ottoman Bank consist : In maintaining the rate of exchange at a maximum of 110 piastres per poimd sterling, at three month? sight. In cashing or discounting bills. In paying the bills handed over to it. In furnishing cheques on the interior or foreign coun tries, &c In return for these engagements, the State grants it for fifteen years 30,000,000 piastres (6,900,000 francs), with securities ; besides a grant of 30,000,000 more at the end of the fifteen years. The proprietors are required to be Ottoman subjects, exceptions being made in favour of MM. David Glavany, a Frenchman ; Hanson, an Englishman ; and Zarifi, a Russian. The mechanism and mode of administering the bank"], [319, "Letter XIV. THE OTTOMAN BANK. 305 are also determined by the statutes. The General Councd consists of the twelve proprietors and three share holders. It is administered by three committees. The General Director is M. Mihran Duz, Master-General of the Mint, and one of the wealthiest capitalists in Turkey. There are three sub-directors \u2014 MM. Glavany, Hanson, and Psychari. The institution of this bank, with its agencies in Europe and in Asia, is an era in itself. It removes dis astrous abuses in commercial transactions, and establishes public and private credit throughout the empire. It ushers Turkey into a new phase, and by the securities it gives to trade, it will cause capital gradually to flow in from Europe. But it does not increase the resources of the treasury ; on the contrary, it saddles it with a new load of 30,000,000 piastres. Now we know that receipts and expenses are nearly equally balanced in Turkey. Hitherto, on the average, if the year had been favour able, though many improvements remained unprovided for, the balance was generally preserved ; but in times of distress, when the tirhi only yielded half the usual amount of 220,000,000 piastres, or some danger entailed an increase of the army and navy, the State was often exposed to a deficit of 100,000,000 or 150,000,000, which it was unable to meet. Thus the wars in Bosnia in 1850 and 1851, and the expeditions to Montenegro, added to other causes, produced the present financial crisis, for which no satisfactory solution has yet been found. In France, in such cases, the excessive expenditure of one year is carried over to the budget of the following year, and met by gradual increase of taxation. Is there no"], [320, "306 LETTERS ON TURKEY.

Letter XV. 308 Other considerations, resulting from the character and customs of the nation, add weight to these geographical arguments in establishing the commercial advantages of Turkey. Sprung from those conquering and pastoral hordes which, after leaving the lofty table-lands of Tur kestan, descended into the plains of Asia-Minor, driving the inhabitants and flocks before them, the Turks, owing to the secret influence that seems to be imparted to Asia of keeping stationary all who Uve on its surface, remained what they were originally, a people first warlike, next agricultural, or rather pastoral, but still adopting the old Roman plan of employing the hands of the conquered tribes, when their own were insufficient, to gradually settle and till the land they subdued. This primitive instinct of the race was strengthened hy the influence of religious ideas, and especially by tra dition, which is all-powerful in the East, and by the law itself, the faithful interpreter of rehgion, with which it is confounded. Though Islam assigns the first place amongst professions honourable to man and grateful to God to that of arms devoted to the defence and propagation of the faith, the second and third places are bestowed on commerce and agriculture, according to these words of the heavenly messenger, recorded by tradition: \" The upright and honest merchant is placed amongst souls that are most exalted in piety ;\" and \" I7ie husbandman is rewarded by God.\" After these follow the different arts and trades, forming the fourth class, which are equally commended to man, in this hadis, \" Man hath nothing to expect, save from the. fruit of his labour;\" a remarkable sentence, which show7s that the principle of entire depend-"], [323, "Letter XV. AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURES. 309 ence upon God, which seems the essential basis of Islamism, is not to be taken in an unqualified acceptation. The divine principle of labour imposed on every Musul man, and of which the prophets themselves have given an example, has conferred dignity on all these branches of trade, though differing from each other in their degree of excellence. The first prophet, Adam, was a husbandman ; Noah was a carpenter and shipwright ; Abraham a weaver : David made coats of mail, and Solomon baskets of the fibre of date-trees ; Zechariah followed the trade of a car penter : and Abou-Bekr, the first caliph, was a weaver ; Omar was a saddler ; Osman a victualler ; Ali, cousin and grandson of the Prophet, was in his youth appren ticed to his master to earn his bread ; lastly, the Prophet himself was down to the time of . his mission a merchant and camel-driver. It is probable that the latter circum stance, proving that the man whom the Musulmans regard as the most perfect creature that ever issued from the hands of God was engaged in trade, has greatly con tributed in causing commerce, next to arms, to be of all professions the most highly esteemed among them. Even at the present day the merchants, wiiom the caravans transport from one extremity of the East to the other, are not only travellers and guests par excellence, they are also the privileged story-tellers and poets ; they alone preserve and disseminate the reports of tradition ; they help to communicate ideas, as well as to exchange merchandise ; and, like large rivers, uniting distant countries that they water, these merchants establish points of contact between people living utterly sundered, and they spread every where on their passage movement, activity, and life."], [324, "Letter XV. 310 LETTERS ON TURKEY. No just idea can be formed of the social value of the merchant in the East unless you have witnessed the arrival of the great caravan of Ispahan, or of Mecca, in some village in the interior of Asia. Some days before its appearance, which has been as correctly estimated as that of the periodical migrations of birds, the whole population of the village through which it passes, and of the neigh bouring villages, is on foot. On the day appointed the caravan appears and defiles slowly, with its eighteen hun dred or two thousand camels, and that multitude of tra vellers and merchants gathered from all parts of the East, and speaking all the dialects in vogue between the Ganges and the Atlas, the Caucasus and the Arabian peninsula. Shortly the caravan halts ; the camels kneel down of their own accord that they may be unloaded ; the bales of are opened and exposed under the naked sky ; the neigh bourhood lays in a store of goods necessary for its con sumption for a whole year, such as Persian shawls and tobacco, coffee, and prints or stuffs from Europe, and returns in exchange the raw produce of its manufacturing industry, and some handfuls of specie, laid by with great difficulty. Then comes the evening : commercial dealings are finished or suspended ; the caravan pitches its encamp ment for the night on the banks of a stream encompassed by lofty plane-trees, or in some khan which has been erected by public beneficence or by the private devotion of some Turk, for the convenience of the merchant-- and travellers.

Never did a pilgrim in the middle ages, when returning from visiting the Holy Places, gather round him a group of more attentive or delighted listeners. When the curiosity of these men, which is always discreet, though they five shut out from the world the rest of the year, is satisfied, one of the merchants, who joins the profession of story-teller to that of trading, suddenly raises his voice and begins one of those tales which so greatly delight the fancy of Orientals. The substance of his story has pro bably been gathered in the course of his rambles, but the decorations are his own ; and the respectful silence that prevails around whilst he speaks lasts even after he has concluded. In the west of Europe the term tradesman conjures up the idea of a man standing stiff and starch uprijrht belund a counter in a shop, or seated from morning till night at a desk in a narrow, dismal office, from which he cannot even descry a corner of the sky, ignorant generally of all that transpires apart from his branch of trade. Hence we do not and cannot form a very clear idea of the ele vated and poetical instincts that are developed amongst men of this same profession in the East, by the habits of long journeys, by frequenting the desert, by passing almost the whole of their lives, at night under canvas, by day in the open air, sub dio. Yet the merchant and trader of ancient times presented the same characteristics as the"], [326, "Letter XV. 312 LETTERS ON TURKEY. present trader in Turkey and Persia, minus the poetical sphere peculiar to the sky and customs of the East. Several passages in Plautus and the comic Latin authors attest the social importance of the mercator at Rome, before the legions of the Republic had carried their con quests farther than their vessels had penetrated. In Greece commerce, after having been the chief link to bind together the different populations of the peninsula, had risen to the importance and dignity of a national and religious institution. The great temples of Apollo were the banks of Greece and of Ionia, and the games celebrated annually at Pisa, Corinth, and Athens were faire and great commercial meetings.' Everywhere the same intention had directed the founding of these temples and games, \u2014 a moral and religious as well as commercial and political intention, like that which gave rise to pil grimages in Islamism. The influence of these combined causes gave commerce a rapid development in Turkey, and carried the empire to that brilbant pitch of material prosperity, in conjunc tion with the power of its arms, which lasted to the end of the seventeenth century. Besides these two principal sources of the wealth of the state, though on a far inferior platform among the professions praised by Islamism, ma nufacturing industry attained in its turn a degree of splen dour that was long envied, without being emulated, by the West. Damascus, Aleppo, Bagdad, Diarbekir, and Broussa, without, speaking of India or China, were long the seat of flourishing manufactures, which forwarded 1 Urquhart, Turkey and its Resources, vol. ii,"], [327, "Letter XV.

But after the seventeenth century everything declined rapidly ; the manufacturing movement slackened : the cultivation of the land was almost neglected ; trade passed from the hands of natives almost entirely into those of Europeans : and the amount of exports, which previously greatly ex ceeded that of imports, fell every day at a rate which showed clearly a neglect of the natural riches of the soil and the diminution of public, wealth. This state of things, which was aggravated by the lapse of time, and whicb it is the present business of the Government to remedy, results not only from the symptoms which marked the general decay of the empire, but also from several special causes, which it may be useful to examine. I. \u2014 Of Agriculture. We have observed that Turkey unites all the conditions calculated to favour the development of the agricultural riches of a country \u2014 climate, geographical position, easy channels of exportation, social organization, temperament and customs of the people, &c. We shall here extract a passage on this subject from a writer to whom we are indebted for useful information on the state of agricultural production in Turkey : \u2014 \" Agriculture is carried on in Turkey under all degrees of difference, between the extremes of soil and climate \u2014 in the arid sands of Arabia, and the most fertile plains of Moldavia\u2014 in spots like Armenia, where deep falls of snow cover the land for a large part of the year, and in the burning soil of Egypt, irrigated artificially by the Nile \u2014 VOL.

As the agriculture of the empire is thus carried on under the extremest opposites of cold and heat, of humidity and dryness, of light and electricity, it supplies so well all the productions required by man that no country can surpass it in this respect. It yields com, rice, chesnuts, and dates : hemp, flax, silk, and cotton ; obves, oranges, almonds, and coffee. ... To the advantages accruing to it from the immense range of its meteorological and agronomic variations must be added the superiority of its incomparable geographical position. Turkey is astride on Europe and on Asia : in the former she possesses Roumelia, a rich country ; in the latter Anatolia, a magnificent territory. In Bosnia and Servia she borders on Austria ; in Moldavia, Bulgaria, Dobrudja, and Armenia, on Russia ; and in Kurdistan on Persia. And this vast extent of territory unites all systems, from the nomadic state and pastoral agriculture to the intro duction of exotics. \" Passing from production to consumption, there are great facilities for the outlet of merchandise in the nume rous channels of export. The country possesses four lakes, a great number of bays and gulfs, and is washed by six seas, which offer it on all hands every advan tage for maritime commerce. The numerous broad and deep rivers that intersect the soil are ready to bear its products on their rapid current to the sea. In Europe we find the Danube, the Save, the Morava, the Sereth, and the Olto; in Asia, the Euphrates, the Tigris, the Kizil-Irmak, and the Jordan ; in Africa, the Nile.

Near Adrianople there are planta tions of roses (gulluz), from which the attar of roses is extracted. Nevertheless, scarcely two-thirds of this ad mirably fertile territory are under cultivation ; and even where it is cultivated, the rent and produce derived from the land are seldom in proportion to its extent.

At the sight of this neglect of husbandry in Roumelia we should be tempted to believe in the reality of that saving, which is much more common amongst us than in Turkey, that the Turks look upon themselves as only encamped in Europe, and that they are gradually wean ing their nffections from provinces which they feel are escaping their grasp, while they centre them in that land of Asia which was the cradle of their race. Yet, if we take a survey of the opposite side of the Straits, the scene does not change : we find everywhere the same fer tility and neglect. We must except the rich plains of Koniah, Kaisarie, Isparta, and Pergamus, in the district of the table-lands forming the centre of Asia-Minor ; and, in the mountainous region, the fine valleys of the Kizil- Irmak (the ancient Halys), to the north-east of Angora, and of the Yechil-Irmak (the ancient Iris), running from Tokat to the Black Sea ; the picturesque valley of Er menck, the valleys of the Maeander (Buyuk Mendere), of the Caister (Kutchuk Mendere), of the Hermus (G-edis- Tschai), of the Caicus (Bakir- Tschai), all opening into the Archipelago ; but, with these exceptions, the whole country shows no trace of cultivation. This territory, which formerly supported numerous and famous cities, the capitals of flourishing kingdoms, such as Pergamos, Sardis, Cyzica, Miletus, Prusium, Troy, Nicomedia, and many"], [333, "Letter XV.

M. de Tchihatschef, who deserves full confidence, in this part of his studies, mentions a plain extending from Caramania to the Sangarius and the salt lake of Tustehly (the Tatta of Strabo), which contains a surface of about 600 square geographical miles, of which only 50 are cultivated. The annual pro duce of corn in Asia-Minor is estimated at 25,000,000 Turkish kiles (705,100,000 kilogrammes;,6 of which one quarter is exported to Europe, representing a value of about 3,000,000Z. This amount might easily be in creased fivefold, and even tenfold, if the great advantages of the soil were turned to account. The same remark applies to all the other productions which serve for local consumption or for exportation, such as rice, of which the quality equals that of Damietta ; the tobaccos of Mag nesia, Pergamus, Adalia, and Samsoun, which rival those of Syria; wood for dyeing, and timber for building, of 8 9,263,000 hectolitres, or 25,473,250 bushels.

The last three articles occupy the first place on the list of exports from Asia Minor. The goats of Angora, which furnish the chief riches to agricultural industry, inhabit a rather limited district, of which the extent may be esti mated at 500 square geographical miles along the west bank of the Kizil-Irmak. The annual produce from this source varies from 450,000 to 500,000 kilogrammes (1,100,000 lbs. avoirdupois) of wool, of whicli about three fourths are exported to Europe, and chiefly to England ; the remainder is employed in the country for the manu facture of shawls and carpets The annual cotton-crop (five kinds or qualities are dis tinguished in trade) is estimated at 30,000 bales, which, allotting a mean weight of 250 kilogrammes (550 lbs. avoirdupois) to each, gives a total of 7,500,000 kilo grammes (16,500,000 lbs.) ; of these 12,000 to 15,000 are exported ; the interior of Anatolia consumes 8,000 ; lastly, the manufactories of Magnesia, Canaba, and Aidin employ about 10,000 bales.

AGRICULTURE. 321 There was, on the contrary, a time when all the riches that it carries in its bosom were railed forth and turned to account, when the sweat and labour of man were inces santly employed in increasing the natural fertility of the soil. Even now we have evidence that at no very remote period cultivation was better understood, population more dense, and the labour and industry of its inhabitants intent on making the most of this favoured soil. This evidence is furnished by the ruins of all descriptions that strew the ground, by the remains of ancient channels of irrigation, by the traces of two or three villages within a space where scarcely one is contained at present, by enormous heaps of stones, resulting from clearing the fields, and other similar facts. By comparing the past with the present, and viewing the existing evils in connection with the remembrance of former prosperity, the reforming Government was soon convinced of the necessity as well as possibility of re-open ing the ancient sources of national riches.

According to the terms of the circular of the Sublime Porte these commissions were to remain in operation during the whole time necessary for the com plete reabsation of the plans of the Government. Each of them was composed of three members, including the pre sident, and of a secretary, chosen in equal numbers among the officers of the anny, the civil functionaries, aud the ulemas. In consequence of the duties of their func tions, the members of the commissions were not to settle down in any fixed locality, but to go from one place to another throughout the district submitted to their inspec tion. They were to provide for all their expenses, and they were forbidden to receive anything from the inha bitants. Sufficient salaries were apportioned to them during the continuance of their functions.8 The members, Musulmans and Christians, convoked at Constantinople, left the capital about the middle of May, or three months after their arrival.

AGRICULTURE. 323 European agriculturists, accompanied by civil engineers and miners, have received at different periods the appoint ment to visit certain provinces of European or Asiatic Turkey, in order to collect statistical data relating to their industrial, agricultural, and commercial state. Thus M. Jonesco, a Moldavian by birth, and formerly a pupil in the school of Roville, explored in detail, in the course of the summer and autumn of 1850, Bulgaria, and especially the Dobrudja, subsequently Macedonia and Thessaly, and embodied the result of his observations in a remarkable report, which was published in the Journal de Constan tinople. The result of the inquiry previously specified, as well as the information furnished by M. Jonesco, show that the principal causes of the decline of agriculture in Turkey can be referred to four heads. lst. Want of knowledge in the cultivators. \u2014 The science of agriculture, which is still so backward amongst us, notwithstanding our numerous useful discoveries and in ventions, is totally unknown in Turkey. Routine and habit alone preside over agricultural operations, and the abundance of the harvests is owing exclusively to the extreme fertility of the soil. No means are employed to stimulate the production or retard the exhaustion of the land. Tillage is confined to scraping the ground with a very primitive plough, constructed exclusively of wood. Manuring as w*ell as rotation of crops are unknown. One plot of ground, after being cultivated for two or three years consecutively, is abandoned, not because it is exhausted, but because it has become too mellow, so that"], [338, "Letter XV. 324 LETTERS ON TURKEY. about one-third of the land appropriated to agriculture is constantly lyinjr fallow. All the other branches of agri cultural industry and economy, such as the drying up of marshes, irrigation, water meadows, the superintendence of forests and lakes, and pastoral agriculture, are either entirely neglected or handed over to blind custom. The mudirs appointed to administer the provinces, and who might, either by their example or counsel, exert a salu tary influence by disseminating principles of sound economy, are for the most part men of the country, who have exercised their functions for from twenty to twenty-five years, as ignorant and as much imbued with prejudices as those beneath them, and conse quently not in a situation to enlighten their ignorance. They are also generally hostile to the Tanzimat, which they do not understand, and which shackles them. To remedy this evil in some measure, the Porte has in the habit, for the last few years, of sending into the cazas mudirs of Constantinople sufficiently enlight ened to understand and second the plans of reform ancl improvement adopted by the Government. The special school of agriculture, founded in 1846 on the imperial farm of Aymana, near the village of San Stephano, about nine miles from Constantinople, was instituted for a similar purpose. This establishment is a special school of agriculture, at once theoretic and practical, hke the French model farms, and supported at the expense of the State, like the other imperial schools amongst which it was classed last 3 ear. It contains at present fifty pupils, and must be regarded as one of the best institutions"], [339, "Let^r XV. AGRICULTURE. 325 flowing from the reforms in Turkey. The Government encouraged simultaneously the formation iu different parts of the country of large rural undertakings directed by Europeans, and intended to initiate gradually the rural population into a knowledge of our agricultural system and implements. Of this nature is the agricultural colony of Adam-Keui, on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, founded by Prince Adam Czartoriski a few years ago, and which contains from 180 to 200 individuals, all Poles.9 Lastly, without lessening the merit of a noble and touching hospitality, the vast grants of land recently made by Sultan Abdul Medjid, and which have created such a sensation in Europe, may be justly regarded as another instance and result of that spirit of colonization which has very properly engaged the Ottoman empire for the last few years, and from which it already begins to reap the fruit. 2ndly. The want of hands. \u2014 But not only is science wanting in the cultivation, there is an actual want of hands. This circumstance, which has such a distressing influence on the state of agriculture in Turkey, results not merely from the scantiness of the population in pro- 9 Originally enrolled among the troops of Schamyl, in the Caucasus, captured by the Russians, and sold by them to the Turks, who brought them to Constantinople. These Poles, most of whom were husband men, were collected by Prince Czartoriski, who settled them at the farm of Adam-Keui, which he had bought, in tbe name of the French monastic order of Lazarists, of Galata. The experiment is too recent to have allowed time for great agricultural results ; but vast spaces, including forests and mountains, have been cleared; considerable structures have been erected ; and now a whole village, composed of several hamlets, is built, where there was formerly a wilderness."], [340, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter XV. 326 portion to the extent of the territory, but is moreover connected with two causes, which it should be a chief object to neutralize. The first is that attraction which, in Turkey more than elsewhere, the towns exert on the country, and which induces the rural population to leave their agricultural labours in order to try their fortune in one of the great centres of population in the interior. This fascination gives birth to the class called Bekiars, who compose a large part of the floating population of Constantinople, without speaking of that crowd of servants, a real scourge of the towns, until measures are adopted to settle them on the land. An analogous measure applied to the Bekiars, i. e. a tax of some hundred piastres levied on them in proportion to the amount of industry which they carry on, would pro bably lead to the same results. As regards the branches of industry which they followed, such as those cf boatmen, porters, hawkers, or pedlars, there will be plenty of idle hands in the capital to supply their place. The second cause is a sort of apathy, which has often been charged against the population of Turkey, as well a -j Spain, though it is not so inherent in them as some people imagine, in proof of which it will suffice, as has been already remarked, to cast a somewhat searching glance at the number of spots which are now changed into deserts, but where we discover at almost ever}- step traces of the activity and industry wiiich formerly prevailed. \" Tlie traveller still finds,\" says M. Jau bert Pa=sa, \" among the branch chains of the Taurus, long valleys and httle ravines, which agricultural industry"], [341, "Letter XV. AGRICULTURE. 327 had formerly fertilised. In venturing among the high cliffs and the precipitous and naked mountains which hang over the streams, he finds many pieces of land now deprived of water, but which were formerly irrigated artificially at a prodigious cost. He is stopped at every turn by the ruins of ancient aqueducts, reservoirs, and canals, which helped to irrigate the land.\"1 I do not deny that this apathy may be slightly connected with the fundamental customs and religious habits of the nation, especially in the case of the Osmanlis \u2014 a matter to which I shall revert shortly ; but its origin must be mainly sought in the memory of a long-enduring oppression, and in the chicanery of the old regime, which, by depriving the hus bandman of all security, destroyed all energy in him, as well as all love for a labour which he knew would be entirely profitless, and all desire for ease and comfort which he was never sure of preserving. In the present clay this uncertainty no longer weighs on the country ; every man is guaranteed the fruit of his labour ; and wore it not that the evils of despotism take a long time to eradicate, tbis apathy would have disap peared long since, with the memory of the former oppres sion. Still there is already evidence of the happy effects of the Tanzimat on the development of agriculture. Those provinces to which it was first extended, such as Bulgaria and Roumelia, are yearly improving and increasing the quantity of their produce, especially as regards cereals, and to such an extent, that now the most inferior corn is equal 1 Jaubert de Passa: Recherches sur les Arrosages dans l'Asie Mineure, la Syrie, &c."], [342, "328 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter XV. to the best quality grown there four years ago. Again, the exports have increased five-fold since 1840.2 The Turks themselves, who were lately the worst husbandmen after the Albanians and Serbs, follow agricultural pursuits with as much ardour as the Bulgarians,3 and their share amounts to one-third of the produce. Other equally satisfactory results may be anticipated as soon as all difficulties are removed relating to the recooni tion of the right of proprietorship in Europeans. When this is effected, and not before, there will be no want of hands in agriculture. The numerous detachments of colonists who yearly emigrate to America, will prefer to pass into European Turkey and Asia Minor. Nor could they find anywhere more favourable conditions for a happy existence, a milder climate, more fertile and accessible land, or a more hospitable population. As a return for this hospitality, they will bring the offering of their hands and then industry, and in a few years they will double the produce of the soil. I could cite several facts under this hea 1, which have come under my personal experience, and which would tend to prove the facility and advantage of colonisation in Turkey. 3rd. Tlie want of circulating capital. \u2014 Money is want ing in Turkey, but riches are not wanting. Let us take 8 In 1840 the quantity of corn exported from Bulgaria and Roumelia amounted only to 296,000 hectolitres (814,000 bushels), whereas in 1818 a proximate estimate gave 1,600,000 hectolitres (4,440,000 bush.) 3 '* The Bulgarians,\" says M. Cyprien Robert, \"are the most intelli gent husbandmen in European Turkey. They irrigate the land in perfect keeping with the laws of statics ; the smallest rivulets are turned to account; every furrow receives its refreshing tribute of water, nor is a drop suffered to be lost.\""], [343, "Letter XV. AGRICULTURE. 329 as an instance the Dobrudja, according to the data fur nished by M. Jonesco. The Dobrudja is a plain of about 1200 square miles in surface, extending along the two livas of the eyalet of Silistria, between the Danube and the Black Sea. It is mentioned in most maps under the appellation of Dobrudja or Dobrowska Tartary, from a tribe of Tartars, originally inhabitants of the Crimea and subsequently of Bessarabia, whence they emigrated into Turkey, after the capture of Ismail, during the last war between the Porte and Russia. The Dobrudja contains 388 villages, distributed into 9 cazas or districts, and inhabited by 15,695 families, presenting a total of 118,320 individuals, or rather less than 100 inhabitants per square league. These 15,695 families belong to twelve different races, including 4800 Turkish families, 3656 Wallachian, 2285 Tartars, 2214 Bulgarians ; the remainder consist of Cossacks, Greeks, Gypsies (Tsiganes), Arabs, Armenians, Jews, and even Germans. Now, according to the statistical tables drawn up by M. Jonesco, the peasant of the Dobrudja ought to be the richest in Europe. In the first place he possesses landed property ; I have previously said in what manner and by what right. Each male individual and head of family occupies a portion of land, necessary for his subsistence ; it belongs to him. The right of preventing others from enjoying the fruits of his labour, with the faculty of handing down his land to his heirs, i. e. the rights that constitute property, are guaranteed to him by the State, to which he pays in return a tax, which is the tithe. The same rule is observed in the other provinces of Turkey. He, moreover, possesses his own cattle, repre-"], [344, "Letter XV. 330 LETTERS ON TURKEY. sensing a mean value of about 950 frs. (47?. 5s. lOd.) per family, composed of from six to seven individuals. But tbe great difficulty is to convert this value into specie. Most articles fetch a very low price. Add to this the bad state of the roads, the distance and rarity of fairs,4 and the want of outlets for exportation. The peasant obliged to buy, and finding no means of selling his pro duce, goes to the nearest town, where he borrows the sum that he requires, on condition of paying back what has been advanced, in corn, subsequently and at a rate agreed upon beforehand. This rate is commonly from five to six piastres the kile, whilst after the harvest he woidd easily obtain from nine to ten piastres. Thus the produce of his fields which is only just sown is sold to another at a loss of from 30 to 40 per cent. ; and after this, as he has httle or no profit to anticipate from his labour, he becomes discouraged, sees his harvest grow for greedy strangers with indifference, and gradually loses all affection for his land, from which he feels himself dispossessed. The inquiry of 1845 pointed out this abuse and the want of specie as one of the chief causes of neglect < Nevertheless there are in Turkey several fairs (panairs), which are held at stated periods. The most important are \u2014 in Roumelia: the great sau* of Yenidje-Vardar, in Macedonia (on the 3rd of December), lasting twenty-two days; the fair of Serres, called Kenan (March 21st), which lasts three, and sometimes even som-, weeks, and which transacts business yearly to the amount of from 14 to 15 millions of piastres; the fairs of Okn , of Varna (May 23rd), of Philippopoii (August 27th), of Eski-Agra, in tho eyalet of Adrianople (November 1,0th), each of which lasts a fortnight; those of Tatar-Bazari (Septem ber 15th), and of Tschaltadje (November 6th), lasting ten days, &c. Tho fairs of Anatolia are not so numerous or important."], [345, "Letter XV. AGRICULTURE. 331 in agriculture. At that period the Government destined a first sum of twenty million piastres to be distributed by the governors of provinces to cultivators in want of seed, of cattle, or of agricultural implements. This advance was made by the state, without requiring in terest, and was only to be reimbursed at the expiration of three or four yeare. But, either from unequal and unfair distribution, or from the greater part of the sum being swallowed up by the agents of Government, the expected result was not obtained, no perceptible increase was made in the production, and money continued as scarce as before in the rural districts. Yet the Porte w-as not discouraged, and every year a part of the sum, which we have seen entered in the budget under the name of Khazinei nafia, was employed for the encouragement of agriculture. The residue was expended for the improvement of the roads and other channels of communication, with the view of stimulating production in another way. The latter is, in fact, the great question, as we shall see presently. But it is desirable previously to caution the reader against certain inductions which he might make from what has just been said. The cultivator in Turkey is poor because he is in want of money ; but he is rich because he has an abundance of the necessaries of life, and because he is also easily satis fied. \" How did you manage to bear poverty ? \" asked Alexander of the old King of Sidon, whom the chances of revolutions had reduced to cultivate a httle garden to gain his bread. \" My hands were enough for me,\" replied the dethroned monarch to the Macedonian con queror ; \"as I wanted nothing, I have had plenty.\""], [346, "332 LETTERS OX TURKEY. Letter XV. This is the secret of the contentment, I might almost say happiness, enjoyed by tbe peasant, and especially the Turkish peasant, in Turkey. His dwelling commonly consists of a hut formed by four walls of stone, badly put together, a roof composed of alternate layers of branches and mud ; sometimes even it consists merely of a tent. His furniture and household utensils consist of a carpet to pray on, mats to sleep upon, wrappers to sleep in at night, one or two saucepans, a coffee-pot, some cups, plates, and wooden spoons.5 But his fields and flocks provide him sufficient food ; he is clothed in the wool of his sheep, and for the rest he trusts in God. It matters little if he be rich or poor, so long as he desires nothing more than is given to him, and if his hut be never closed to the stranger. This is the effect of a rehgion whose entire system of morals is intimated by its very name, resignation to God, and in which everything has been admirably combined to make man happy and contented in the lot in which he was bora. Unfortunately, owing to a moral law which it is difficult to determine, and whose contradictory character forms one of the great problems of the science of humanity in modern times, absolute contentment is fatal to the perfectioning of our race : and again, this simple mode of life, and the absence of all wants, which is the source of individual ease, is at the same time diametrically opposed to the wealth and greatness of a nation.

AGRICULTURE. 333 State is that w Inch consumes and produces the most, and where the number and variety of wants is an incessant stimulus to the activity of man, and opens daily a vaster field for his exertions. 4th. The want of channels of communication. \u2014 Turkey is entirely wanting in roads and great arteries of inter course. We shall here insert some observations of M. Jonesco on tliis subject : \u2014 \"* The present channels of com munication in the Dobrudja and a part of Bulgaria do not properly deserve that name, as they have only been traced out by the inhabitants to indicate the shortest mid easiest way from one town to another, rather than to facilitate the transport of produce to the markets. No work of the latter description has been hitherto under taken, and consequently the means of transport are in character with the roads. Waggons and carts, joined without a nail or a particle of iron, and only costing from 60 to 80 piastres, roll over the soil of the Dobrudja, making a path and a road wherever they go. The state of this road depends on the heat, humidity, aud all other atmosjheric causes. When the earth is soaked with water the road is impracticable, and the intelligent hus bandman waits till fine weather, heat, and the wind have dried up the earth and made the road passable.\" The remarks of M. Jonesco on the Dobrudja apply equally w*ell to all the other provinces of the empire. Nowhere in Turkey do you descry any appearance of roads, save in the neighbourhood of the large towns, nor are the roads even there kept in any degree of repair. From Constan tinople to Adrianople, the second town of the empire, there is only a piece of the line opened of a score or two"], [348, "LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter XV. 334 of miles, terminating a little beyond San Stephano. Ac cordino-ly an Armenian company, which had started a line of dibgences on this road in 1848, was obbged to give up the undertaking after a few months, this having been the first attempt of the kind in Turkey, and one from which the country might have derived the greatest benefit. But such were the impediments, owing to the bad state of the roads, that six days were required in the middle of the summer to go 80 leagues (192 miles). You are stopped at almost every turn by streams over which beams have been thrown, taking the place of a bridg?. and, though accessible to foot passengers and horsemen, quite impassable in carriages. The result of this is that the grower is obliged to transport his goods on horseback or on mules, which doubles the freight. It is needless to dwell on the mischief entailed by such a system on agriculture and commerce. '\u2022The want of roads,\" says M. Blanqui, iu his ' Travels in Bulgaria,' M occasions every day the strangest contrasts of distress and abundance. Thus, whilst there is plenty of fuel in the Balkan, and of forage in the high plains, these two articles fetch so high a price at Constantinople that they are sold by the pound weight like bread. All property which cannot transport itself, like cattle, or which is bulky, like certain valuable articles, can only be turned to ac count within a certain compass.\" I shall also mention some facts from my own knowledge, which will be stronger arguments than all reflections. I have already spoken of the splendid forests on the shores of the Black Sea, which the Government is obbged to neglect; and ofthe re of corn, which in the central provinces is offered"], [349, "Letter XV. AGRICULTURE. 335 for three or four piastres, whilst it is commonly sold for twenty piastres at Constantinople. I was informed in 1846 that certain districts of Asia Minor were suffering from scarcity owing to the failure of the crops, whilst at the distance of twenty or twenty-five leagues (sixty miles) the corn was rotting on the spot, in another canton, for want of consumers. At the present time the price of carriage from the different localities of Roumelia, border ing on the Maritza, to Rodosto, on the Mediterranean, absorbs more than the profit that the merchant can rea sonably expect. The transport of com from the valley of the Touldja and the plain of Eski-Agra to Bourgaz, on the Black Sea, costs 100 per cent, of the cost price on the spot. The same remark applies to most of the articles of consumption. In winter from 1847 to 1843 the price of an oke of coals, an object of the first necessity in Turkey, where there is scarcely any other fuel, amounted to one piastre, the same price as that of corn, whilst at the same time, in Macedonia, at twenty leagues from the. coast, whence it could be easily transported to the capital by sea, it only cost five piastres for a hundred okes. Fuel, whicb only costs in Macedonia the trouble of cutting and stacking it, costs at Constantinople twice as much as in Paris, though only exposed to a tax of three per cent. on the value that it fetches. Notwithstanding all this roads might be opened almost everywhere for a very small outlay. Throughout the whole of European Turkey, and especially in Thessaly, there are numerous vestiges of Roman roads, even in the mountainous districts. M. Jonesco notices the existence of bridges of ancient construction, and still used, on"], [350, "336 LETTERS ON TURKEY. Letter XV. a great many passes, which the old roads traversed. These vice and bridges might be easily restored. As ds new lines to be opened, there are almost on all hands abundance of materials requisite for building, such as granite, flint, millstones, freestone, lime, &c. Nor is this all : in many places the roads are, in a measure, pre pared by nature, and only require, for the greater part of their course, the labour necessary for smoothing the rocks which are on a level with the ground. Besides the very moderate charge for labour, which nowhere exceeds six piastres, the state might almost reckon on the gratuitous assistance of the population, so univer sally is the want felt of great channels of communication. An evidence of this was presented at the time of the inauguration of the new road from Trebizond to Erze roum, and thence to the frontier of Persia, in the month of September, 1850. Scarcely had the intelligence reached the country that Ismail Pasha had arrived at Constantinople to preside over the opening of the works himself, and that he was in want of workmen, when the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, Christian and Musul man, came by thousands to offer, and began to compete in founding the new road with such ardour that it might have been finished before the following autumn, if any thing were ever finished in Turkey. The more we reflect the more convinced we become that the future of Turkey depends almost exclusively on this one thing \u2014 opening roads. To open roads is not only to develop agriculture, to create outlets for commerce, to give a development to local industry, so as to increase the material riches of the country : it also establishes a"], [351, "Letter XV. AGRICULTURE. 337 great moral and social unity, by facilitating the main tenance of order in the interior, the diffusion of know ledge, and the approximation of populations no less removed by the strength of prejudices than by actual distance. Besides, the serious question of the establish ment of roads in Turkey is connected with the execution of other great works long since projected, and which are not less important to agriculture and commerce. We can only mention a few of the most important of these, whicli are. first, the plan of a new channel from the Danube to the Black Sea, shorter and less dangerous than the present Sulina channel, either by opening a canal from Kustendje to Tchernavoda by the lake of Kara Sou, or by the branch of a river named Dounavez, and the great lake of Rassim, situated at a very short distance from the sea, with which it communicates by two mouths. Secondly, we have an analogous plan for joining the Black Sea with the Gulf of Nicomedia by means of the Sangarius and of the lake Sabandja, distant six leagues from the Sea of Marmora with which it com municates by a httle river. The result of this improve ment would be that timber and fuel could be conveyed more securely and cheaply from Bithynia and elsewhere to the capital.6 A third great project is that of ren- \u00ab Pliny proposed this plan to Trajan whilst he governed Bithynia.

MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. 339 II. \u2014 Of Manufacturing Industry. Manufacturing industry has greatly declined from what it formerly vvas iu the Ottoman Empire. At present the greater part of the exports of Turkey consist in raw material, which it hands over to Europe, and which the latter returns to Turkey in a manufactured form. The numerous and varied manufactures, which formerly sufficed not only for the consumption of the empire, but which also stocked the markets of all parts of the Levant, and of several countries of Europe, no longer exist or have completely declined. The forges of Samakov and of Fognitza in Bulgaria and Bosnia, the manufactories of arms at Mostar and Travnik in the latter province,8 are almost the only large manufacturing concerns in European Turkey. At Scutari and Tirnova there were two thousand looms of muslin in operation in 1812, whereas there were only two hundred in 1841. Five years ago Salonica possessed from twenty-five to twenty eight silk-looms; this number has been reduced to eighteen, producing about 88,000 lbs. of fine silk per annum. In Anatolia, Diarbekir and Broussa, which were formerly so renowned for their velvets, satins, and silk stuffs, do not now produce a tenth part of what they yielded from thirty to forty years ago. The latter scarcely manufactures 400,000 piastres' worth of silk annually, 8 The Turks always excelled in the tempering of steel for thi cation of arms. Witness the fine Damascus blades, and those manu factured at Travnik, at Constantinople, and in some other parts of the empire. But their exorbitant price, which converts them into articles of luxury, prevents their being demanded in foreign parts, aud has greatly contributed in causing the decline of this branch of industry.

The same decay is observable in the old manufacturing towns of Syria and of Arabian Irak. Bagdad was once the centre of very flourishing manufactories, especially occupied with calico-printing, tanning and preparing leather, pottery, jewellery, &c. The combined produce of all these branches of industry, which formerly supplied a great part of the trade of the Levant, attains now scarcely a value of three or four millions. Aleppo was still more flourishing than Bagdad. Its mamdactures of gold thread, of cotton tissues, silk and gold, cotton and silk, and pure cotton, called nankeens, gave occupation to more than 40,000 looms, and manufactured yearly an amount estimated at a himdred millions ; the present yearly value produced does not exceed seven or eight millions. The industry of the islands has not declined so much : Candia still produces soap and tissues to the value of six millions ; Cyprus manufactures printed calicoes, which are used to cover the divans in Turkey, light silks, gold and silk embroideries, and quilted counterpanes, highly esteemed in the Levant. To these chief articles of native industry, it is proper to add the camlets of Angora, and the goats' -hair stuffs, known in the Levant trade by the name of chary, the sandals of Chios, the printed calicoes of Tokat, the crapes and gauzes of Salonica, the carpets of Smyrna, and those which are manufactured in certain districts of Bulgaria, especially at Jaskoi ; lastly, saddlery, a branch of industry which has never been emulated in Europe. Besides the general causes which I pointed out whilst"], [355, "Letter XV. MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. 341 treating of agriculture, two special causes appear to me to have influenced the existing state of manufac- turing industry among the Turks. The first is an inveterate custom, which inclines them always to employ the same processes of manufacture ; the other results from the reforms themselves, which, by the changes that they introduced in costume, made Turkey tributary to Europe for the new stuffs which it borrowed from the latter, and which it was unable to manufacture at so low a price: and thus these reforms destroyed at a blow the most important branches of native manufacturing indus- try. Nevertheless, instead of learning a lesson from tliis inferiority, which was a necessary consequence of its position, and instead of directing all its efforts to agri- culture, so as to maintain the balance of commerce, Turkey fell into that error, so common to young states or nations in the process of transformation, of endeavouring to produce all things necessary for its own consumption. Though it is an essentially agricultural country, as we have seen, instead of favouring to the uttermost the productions and culti.otion of its soil, and of handing over its raw materials to foreign industry, which sends them back in a manufactured state, it committed the error of trying to become a manufacturing comitry itself, when it had everything to create, and could only proceed slowly, and as it were by groping. Nor was there any assignable cause for this foolish mistake, save the puerile satisfaction of being able to say that Turkey could manufacture cloths as well as Europe \u2014 iron and glass as they do in Europe.

Hence the share that accrued to Turkey in the merit and labour of tbe manufactures was very small. Still, it might have been excusable if it had succeeded. But the Sultan only repeated, at his own cost, the experi ment of Mohammed Ah ; and if Turkey had not pos sessed admirable resources, it would have succumbed like Egypt- I shall here mention a fact extracted from a number of others. A few years ago the Government judged it more con venient, and probably also less expensive, to have a foundry and forges at Constantinople, instead of obtain ing its iron from England. They began by expending eight or nine millions for the construction of their works ; after this they called in an English engineer, and English mechanics to work them. The material and the machines, which were also brought from England, swallowed up several millions more. On the other hand, and as a set-off, the Government possessed a superb establish ment, situated not more than half a league from the capita], on the sea-shore, and the brightest hopes were entertained of its success. The ore was brought from the Prinkipo islands, eighteen miles distant ; and the mines of Heraclea, distant about thirty miles, furnished the coal ; and both the ore and the coals were transported to the furnaces by water. Still, on comparing accounts, it was found that the iron it yielded came to more than fifty piastres the quintal (220 lbs.), while the same quantity is habitually sold for forty-two piastres in the market\" at Constantinople. Another foundry, which was established at a great cost"], [357, "Letter XV. \"51 VNUFACTURLNG INDUSTRY. 343 at Beschik-tash, on the Bosphorus, has been abandoned, and is now- used, I believe, as a victualling magazine.

Eighty-fom- mines were formerly in full operation in Asia Minor, whereas now only fourteen are worked, and these scarcely yield one-third of what they ought to do. The same result has attended the attempts of the Government to introduce foreign branches of manufacture into Turkey. The manufacture of printed calicoes at San Stefano, and the imperial manufactories of cloth and silk at Ismid (Nicomedia), have great difficulty in keeping a footing. There are only two branches of manufacture recently introduced into Turkey which have yielded satisfactory results: tbe paper factory at Smyrna, and the fez-khane, where fez caps9 are manufactured, at Eyoub. The latter establishment was founded in 1832, by Sultan Mahmoud, in consequence of a decree pro- mulgated at that period, which directed that the fez should be worn as a national head-dress instead of the turban.

It results from these facts united, that Turkey should learn two lessons from the past : first, that she ought to give up, for the present, all attempts at competing with Europe for the main objects of manu facture, and to confine herself to bringing forth the natural riches of her soil, or to several special branches of native manufacture, destined to give life to her inland trade, such as carpets, shawls, morocco leather, gold embroidery, saddlery, arms, soap, &c.

That country is ignorant of the numerous prohibitions which shackle commerce in Europe, and free trade, so clamorously insisted on by the abolitionists of England and France, has been in vogue in Turkey from time immemorial. The following extract from the ' Moniteur Ottoman ' of September, 1832, will give a proof of this : \u2014 \" Common sense, tolerance, and hospitality have long since realised in the Ottoman empire what the other states of Europe endeavour to accomplish by various political combinations, differing in merit.

In Turkey, every object ex changed is admitted and circulates without encountering any other obstacle than the payment of an infinitely small part of its value in passing the custom-house. The chimera of the balance of trade has never entered Turk ish heads, whicli are reasonable enough not to have ever calculated if there is more profit in selling than in buying. Accordingly the Turkish ''markets, supplied by all coun tries, do not reject any of the produce that the com mercial spirit may send into circulation ; they do not impose any tax on the ships that bring this produce ; they are seldom or rather never the theatre of those dis ordered movements, occasioned by the unforeseen rarity of certain articles, which sometimes cause the prices to rise to an exorbitant extent, and convert commerce into a system of perpetual alarms and dangers.*' Then, after contrasting Turkish free trade with the restrictions of European states, the steadiness of the demand and of prices of merchandise in Turkish mar kets with the fluctuations produced by the European system, the Government organ proceeds \u2014 \"It has often been asserted that the Turks are only encamped in Europe ; but it cannot surely be their conduct to foreign- hich has given birth to this idea of a. precarious occupation.

In Turkey, and in Turkey only, hospitality appears under a grand, noble, and dignified aspect ; it is not only a momentary shelter from the storm, but it is a hospitality which, rising from the dignity of mere benevolence to that of a political reception, embraces the future as well as the present. As soon as the stranger has placed his foot on Turkish ground, he is saluted with the name of guest (mussafir).

I repeat the expression absolute freedom, for temporary restrictions, made necessary by the obligation of providing for the subsistence or security of a country, can never be regarded as a negation of the principle. An instance of the latter kind was presented"], [362, "Letter XVI. 348 LETTERS ON TURKEY. in 1846, when the intelligence was forwarded to the Government by its agents in Syria that some foreign merchants were introducing muskets into that province, which they were selbng to the rebellious mountaineers, on which occasion the Porte issued a memorandum for bidding the importation of muskets, from whatever source, into Syria.1 The Porte has also thought it desirable, in the course of the last few years, in consequence of con tinually increasing purchases of corn for Europe, to forbid the sale and exportation of cereals in certain parts of the empire, especially in Asia Minor (Memorandum of the 26th Redjeb, 1261 = 31st July, 1845), in Roumelia (Memorandum ofthe 25th Zil horde = 25th November of the same year), at Salonica, and in the ports dependent on it (Memorandum of the 5th Moharrem, 1262, and the 13th Rebine-evvel, 1263 = 4th January, 1846, and 1st March, 1847). But these prohibitions were only preventive and momentary measures, occasioned by extra ordinary circumstances, and dropping with the cessation of the cause. The privileges and advantages enjoyed by foreign trade in Turkey have no parallel in any other country, and are a consequence, or rather abuse of the same principle. Among tbe most remarkable instances of these privileges, we may cite the different treaties or decrees in commercial affairs that have been since issued or contracted ; such as the commercial treaty negotiated, in 1838, with France and England, and successively 1 Memorandum ofthe 29th of Moharrem, 1262 (January, 1846).

Inland Trade. The trade of Turkey is divided into inland and foreign. The inland trade may be classed into two categories \u2014 First, that of mutual exchanges between the ports, or scale,9 and commercial marts of Turkey ; Secondly, that of the exchanges between Turkey and its tributary provinces. The want of official documents emanating from the Custom-house department or the Ministry of Commerce at Constantinople makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain even a proximate estimate of the former.

Now it results from the figures of these accounts, as well as from personal information which I was able to acquire on the spot, that the foreign trade of Turkey can be esti mated at a mean value of 10,800,000?.

It is well known that the English directed their attention to the East at au early date. Their Levant Company, created under the direction of James I., about fifty years before the charters were granted to the East and West India and to the South Sea Companies, soon supplanted that of France in the Turkish trade, notwithstanding the immense privileges stipulated in favour of the latter, when it had obtained from the Porte the privilege of being the protector of all Franks trading in the Levant, and a ferman of the Grand Signior forbade all European vessels from appearing in the Turkish waters under any other flag than that of France. But the progress of British commerce with Turkey has been especially remarkable within the last few years. Thus the total value of British imports into Turkey, which in 1827 amounted only to 500,000?., in which cotton roods entered as three-fourths, had attained even in lsb0 a value of 1,040,000?. It amounts at present to 4,120,000?. From these four millions 1,800,000?. must be deducted for the transit trade to Persia. This transit is effected almost exclusively through Trebizond, where English goods arrive, either directly or via Constantinople, whence they are subsequently forwarded to Tiflis. England receives in return two-thirds of their value in kind, one-third in raw material, and especially raw hides.

Since 1789, the sum of the French imports has decreased by about two-fifths. This diminution relates chiefly to cotton goods, of which England has monopolised the supply ; it also relates to colonial wares, and espe cially cloth ; France having been supplanted in the latter trade by Austria, in the same way that England had driven Venice out of the market.

The greater part of these goods are forwarded through Trieste, which has become the great emporium of the trade of Austria and Germany with the Levant. The land trade is carried on along a frontier extending from Bukowina to Croatia.

Italy, Switzerland, Holland, \u00a7e. \u2014 Almost the whole of the Italian trade with the Levant is in the hands of Sardinia. Tuscany exports a few taffetas and velvets of Florence, and imports in return the silk and cotton of Syria, copper, and asphalte. Switzerland ranks among the first of the second order of commercial states trading with Turkey, owing to its numerous invoices of manufactured goods. But as there are no customs in the states of the Swiss Republic, only a proximate estimate of the value of its commerce can be obtained. Its chief exports are Geneva watches and clocks, cotton goods (in which the Swiss compete with England), taffetas, and the produce of the manufac tures of the Zollverein, which the makers are skilful to adapt to the taste of the different countries of the Levant, All these woods are forwarded via Trieste and Marseilles, and scarcely any return is made for them. The exports and imports of Turkey in connection with Holland are almost the same as in the case of Belgium."], [372, "Letter XVI. 358 LETTERS ON TURKFY. It is, however, difficult to obtain an exact estimate of their value. The official tables of the Netherlands trade for the year 1849 give a return of 4,800,000 florins in the case of imports into Holland, and 13,400,000 for exports ; total, 18,200,000 florins. But this amount represents the total value of the Dutch imports and exports, not only in connection with the Levant, but also comprising Austria and Italy. The other states which maintain commercial relations with Turkey, but on quite a secondary footing, are \u2014 first, the United States, which import from Turkey annually seven or eight cargoes of dried fruits, and occasionally export thither rum, coffee, and other colonial produce ; the Hanseatic Towns, the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, Den mark : Sweden and Norway also carry on some trade with Turkey. The latter country, in 1851, exported to Turkey goods to the value of 1,775,000 francs, including 1,765,000 francs' worth of smoked and salted fish. END OF VOL. I."], [373, "tOSDON I I-KINTED BI W.
