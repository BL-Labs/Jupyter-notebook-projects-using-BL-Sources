CHAPTER I. \"AS I GAED up the canongate.\" The Canongate of Edinburgh was lying in the full sunshine of a summer morning, which brought out in bold relief its high lights and deep shadows, its stateliness and its squalor. In its promiscuous and often incongruous life and movement, there figured freely lords and ladies ; douce burghers and their thrifty spouses ; learned lawyers and divines ; caddies and fishwives ; members of the City Guard, in their cocked hats \u2014 coats, waistcoats, and breeches of a \" muddy-coloured red,\" with their gruesome Lochaber axes ; incorrigible vagrants and still more incorrigible randies \u2014 now a stray Englishman bewildered and scandalized, now a wild Highlander equally amazed and disgusted, but from an entirely different point of view. The"], [12, "8 LADY JEAN'S SON. wheeled vehicles ranged from family coaches, though these were comparatively rare, to carrier's carts, cadger's carts, carts of peat, and salt barrows. The quadrupeds ran from a race-horse or a dragoon's charger, to a yelping cur or a brood sow \u2014 sows affecting the streets of Edinburgh to a remarkable extent at this time. The garbage \u2014 who shall sum up the garbage discharged at night fall on the \" plain stanes \" and the causeway, and only partially cleared away in the morning, unless in the words which a modern poet applied to a very different scene \u2014 \" Tin kettles, rotten eggs, Cabbage stalks, and wooden legs \"? For the time referred to was prior to the memor able arrival of the great Dr. Johnson at the White Horse in the High Street. The fine old palace of Holyrood was destitute of the shadow of royalty. The Duke and Duchess of York's visit was a thing of the past. Even poor Prince Charlie's romantic, doomed Court, which had been held for a few delirious weeks under the muttered thunder of the Castle guns, had vanished like their smoke, though that was an alarming episode which was comparatively of yesterday. But if royalty was gone over the borders and"], [13, "\"AS I GAED UP THE CANONGATE.\" 9 was never again to dwell, for a permanency, in Holyrood or the Castle, at Scone or at Stirling, Falkland or Linlithgow ; if there were to be no more magnificent pageants to and from the Parlia ment House, yet the old nobility and gentry had not unanimously followed the King and Parliament. There were still great mansions tenanted by their old owners, rubbing shoulders with little shops in tall \" lands,\" containing every kind of sample of the population \u2014 from the cobbler or the tailor drawing out his thread on the first floor, to the laird of gentle bluid, the doctor, or the writer, with their families, on the second and third, the trades man on the fourth, the mechanic, or the semp stress, or the penniless gentlewoman on the fifth and sixth. These lands were like blocks of buildings borrowed, with their inhabitants, from old Paris. There was still a cluster of duchesses and countesses \u2014 Douglas, Queensberry, Dunbar, Eglin ton, Teviotdale, Morton \u2014 whose town-houses were in the Canongate. As for the narrow, black browed closes, so narrow in some instances that the light of day was but dimly seen in them, and neighbourly hands could have been stretched across in neighbourly greeting, they still bore the names of many a highly honourable baron, knight,"], [14, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 10 bishop, and judge, and the tenements in them con tinued to be crammed with sprigs of quality and their kindred, or respectable merchants and their retainers. It was not an Edinburgh greedy of elbow-room, or of breathing space ; not a dainty or fastidious Edin burgh, according to nineteenth-century notions ; but it was a marvellously picturesque Edinburgh, full of strong characters, strange stories, wit, wisdom, prejudice, and passion. Two girls of birth and position were wending their way up the Canongate, in the direction of the High Street. They should have been in their sedan-chairs, if not in the coach which one of them could claim as her father's, any intelligent observer might suggest, and probably they would have been if they had been older, and matrons, not maidens. Yet even matrons were not too high-minded and squeamish to traverse, on foot, the homely, encumbered, grand old streets, with their very mixed company, whenever business or pleasure called them forth. The ladies of Edin burgh belonging to that generation were, from youth to age, hardy, independent to daring, not too sensitive to the roughness and slatternliness, with its reverse of old-fashioned dignity and mag nificence, among which they had been bred. But"], [15, "\"AS I GAED UP THE CANONGATE.\" n at the core they were as honest-hearted and pure-minded as the most refined of their suc cessors. The two young ladies were not unattended in their walk. They were followed, at a discreet distance, by an elderly waiting-gentlewoman, Lady Teviotdale's maid, and at two or three paces farther off still, as in a sliding scale of degree, by a staid manservant. The girls were dressed in the universal fashion of their day, with hoops, trained skirts \u2014 drawn through the pocket-holes for walking, and open in front, in order to show petticoats trimmed with gold or silver lace \u2014 and high-heeled shoes. They wore muslin fichus, and their powdered hair was surmounted both by round-eared mob-caps and by straw hats. But the hats, with flowing ribands to mix with the flowing hair and match the gowns, were different. In the one case, the hat was so small as to require to be poised with care above the softly falling Mechlin lace border ; and in the other, it was extravagantly large, forming a flapping shield to the youthful face within it. This huge hat was surmounted by a huge plume of feathers, such as has not been seen, even as part of the decorations of a hearse, in recent years. But the wearer carried her head so high, and with"], [16, "12 LADY JEAN'S SON. such natural nobility, that it could bear even the absurd bunch of tall, nodding feathers, without fatal injury to her general appearance. The girls did not present the contrast of tall and slender, short and plump, dark and fair. They were both about the middle height, though the one looked inches taller than the other, because of that majestic trick of bearing, which, whether it is found in man or woman, is calculated to deceive the spectator. The other girl, who looked less than she was, had a willowy grace rather than a stately erectness of figure. Both girls were blondes. Their long curls were a light brown, and had been in childhood such \"lint white locks,\" as had earned for their small owners the sobriquet of \" lint tops.\" But the complexion, features, and eyes were totally un like. The complexion of the girl who carried herself with a frank consciousness of her claims, had been carefully preserved in its pure, vivid red and white. Her nose was aquiline, while there was more squareness in her forehead, her mouth, with its white, glancing teeth, and her chin, than is usually found with an aquiline nose. The eyes were steel-blue, with eyebrows and eyelashes darker than the hair. The other girl's complexion would have been"], [17, "\"AS I GAED UP THE CANONGATE.\" 13 very delicate, like that of the palest wild blush rose, which yet, by dint of its home in the June hedgerow, is, in its sweet faintness of hue, as full of breezy freshness and vigorous health as the ruddiest flower of the field or garden. But sun and wind, even in the heart of the old town, had done to the human blossom what they refrain from doing to the hedge beauty \u2014 they had tanned her a little, and freckled her still more, whenever they had an opportunity. This was an injury in carping eyes, which was rendered more con spicuous and objectionable by the thinness of the face thus unceremoniously treated. The nose was small and fine, but of no particular order. The mouth had grave curves for so young a mouth, and had a habit of falling into a pout \u2014 not of temper, but of anxious consideration \u2014 an expres sion almost comically contradicted by the exceed ing girlishness of the little, peaked chin. The eye brows and eyelashes were lighter in tint than the hair, without approaching to the insipid lightness which, with its corresponding defect of sight, used to be termed derisively \" blind-fairness.\" Brows and lashes matched here the hazel of the eyes. They were not so well defined and expressive as those of the other girl, but with the eyes they were softer and more tender."], [18, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 14 The one girl was the more beautiful and the more striking in her beauty ; the other was the lovelier and the more winning in her loveliness. The more beautiful girl was Lady \"Marget\" Elliot, only daughter of the Earl and Countess of Teviot dale ; the lovelier was Jeanie Erskine, eldest daughter of Mr. Simon Erskine, of the Hammer men's Close, who, although he had not attained to any great success in his profession, and was fain to act as clerk to the Lord Chief Justice, had been bred to the bar, and was sib to the Buchan Erskines. Those same Erskines, like the rival houses of Cockburn and Clarke, had already begun to supply to Edinburgh giants of wisdom and wit, who held the foremost place in their generation, whose full-flavoured memories linger yet among the glories of the old capital. Though the girls' fortunes and prospects were widely contrasted, there was no idea of any radical inequality of rank between them. They were alike gently born and bred, and they had been neighbours, companions, and, latterly, intimate friends, whenever the Teviotdale family forsook the country house of Teviotside in Roxburghshire and came to occupy their town house in the Canongate, not very many yards higher up than the entrance to the Hammermen's Close. In the"], [19, "\"AS I GAED UP THE CANONGATE.\" 15 extreme simplicity which alternated with the elaborate state of the period, even a Lady Marget could traverse that little bit of street in deshabille and without an escort. This was when she flew to her \" maiden cummer \" and confidante, to give her in person the details of the last night's assembly at which Jeanie had not been present ; to ask her opinion of a new sacque or riding habit ; above all, to sound her on the merits and demerits of the rival suitors already buzzing about the sole daughter of the house of Teviotdale. Not being entirely self-engrossed, and happening to possess both a kind heart and a lively inquiring mind, Lady Marget also sought to glean from her friend (though with greater difficulty, for Jeanie Erskine was more reserved and chary in her communica- tions) the precise state of her \"affair.\" Was there any chance of Jeanie's father changing his mind with regard to the suit of a certain young gentleman whom it was not necessary for them to mention by name ? If not, had Jeanie made up her mind to shut herself up like a nun for his sake ? Or did she mean to become the mere bondslave of the wild troop of younger brothers and sisters, for whom, in conjunction with her father, she had already sacrificed much ? Lady Marget was in the act of dragging Jeanie,"], [20, "16 LADY JEAN'S SON. half-reluctant, half-eager, to be present at a great public spectacle in which both girls were deeply interested. They were bound for the Parliament House where a famous trial was being held, the Tichborne trial of its day, with which the whole country was ringing. It divided chief friends, it split every class into factions, and was the cause of more than one popular tumult which assumed alarming proportions. It had lasted for the greater part of this month of July. Evidence had been taken for twenty-one days. Then, for five out of the remaining ten days, no less than fifteen sagacious and astute law-lords had pondered over and sifted the evidence presented to them. The trial turned upon the question whether \" Lady Jean,\" sister of the Duke of Douglas, and her husband, Mr. Drummond, were really the parents of twin sons, as the couple had represented themselves to be. The alternative suggested by their opponents was that the pair had, during their stay in France, procured two infants from French peasants, and that these infants Lady Jean and Mr. Drummond had attempted to pass off as their own. The supposed object of the deception was to impose the elder of the two children on the Duke of Douglas as the heir to the great Douglas estates. The case was tried before the Court of"], [21, "\"AS I GAED UP THE CANONGATE.\" 17 Session, and subsequently before the House of Lords. Jeanie Erskine did not yield even to Lady Marget in her burning interest in the case ; neither was Jeanie without the active curiosity of her sex ; but she was better accustomed to restrain her impulses and control her feelings, and she was still doubtful of more than one point that had to do with their expedition. \"Are you certain, my lady, your mother is informed and approves of our going to the House?\" Jeanie put the question anxiously to her companion. \" Quite sure, Jeanie,\" Lady Marget answered confidently ; \" I would not go without telling her, even though I thought she would conter me, which she seldom does, for my mother and I understand each other.\" Jeanie knew that this was perfectly true. The Countess was a somewhat awful dame \u2014 stiff starched, and despotic. Most people \u2014 including her fiery old Earl, who had a lame knee from a wound incurred in his youth in the wars of \" Hie Germanie,\" and from a choleric temper exasperated by the infirmity \u2014 deferred more or less to my lady But her daughter had no more fear of her mother B"], [22, "18 LADY JEAN'S SON. than of her father ; indeed, she was aware that, in the midst of their stormiest mood, she was as the apple of their eye. \"You ken we have only to enter the door of the Parliament House to find more escorts than we want, and the best of places sought out for us. We are not singular in our tastes ; the court is crowded to the door day after day, there is no want of company. We shall be supported by gentle and simple, the pick of the town, both ladies and gentlemen. I dare say Lady Teviot dale will be there with the rest as the day wears on, but she has always so much to settle before she goes out, that we might lose the best of the proceedings if we waited for her. And if it came to a decision, though I do not expect that yet, it would be a fell-like thing for the decree to be given and neither me nor you there, Jeanie. We are the most concerned of all the women in braid Scotland, far more than their Graces of Douglas and Queensberry, for all the steer they make.\""], [23, "CHAPTER II. IN THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE. LADY MARGET and Jeanie Erskine had passed through the Nether Bow and reached the High Street, where St. Giles's Saint's Crown was a reproach or a consolation, as the gazer might take it, to its neighbour opposite \u2014 the grim old Tol booth, with its turrets and grated windows. The Luckenbooths, with their stalls and promiscuous merchandise encumbering the width of the street, offered no attraction to the girls. They crossed by a side passage into the Parliament Square, which, early in the day as it was, had already far more than its ordinary loungers. These con sisted of strolling barristers, come out to take a turn and have a chat, walking in their wigs instead of their three-cornered hats, with their clasped hands and ruffled wrists under their professional black gowns, like so many solemn rooks or mis chievous jackdaws. There were also country clients of weight, both literally and figuratively,"], [24, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 20 in their riding-coats and long boots, hurrying up to learn the fortunes of their suits. There were lawyers' clerks, with their insignia of office, in the shape of blue bags stuffed with papers. There were poor pleaders, like the immortal \" Peter Peebles,\" clutching their pleas as they shambled along, artlessly ready to accost passers by and pour forth their piteous tales. There were witnesses of both sexes, excited and bois terous, or timid and trembling, marshalled by special officials, that they might avail themselves of the accommodation and seclusion provided for them. To-day these formed but a fraction of the company, which was, even before noon, increased by many a public-spirited shopkeeper, journey man-baker and craftsman, truant schoolboy from the High School, serving-man and serving-woman of masters and mistresses prevented from joining the more privileged and select crowd within, who sent their retainers to gather the tidings of how the day was going, which drifted out from the inner tribunal to the waiting throng without. As Lady Marget had predicted, she and Jeanie Erskine found no difficulty in making their way. Lady Marget's aristocratic presence and her retinue, limited as it was, caused a passage to be"], [25, "IN THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE. 21 opened for the girls. As they went through, they could catch the comments of the bystanders directed at the new arrivals, but always reverting to the centre of interest in the assembly. \" A pair o' braw young leddies. They'll be friends of the t'ane or the t'ither in the business, the pursuer or the defender.\" \" Eh, sirs, sich a business ! A fine young laud telled that he's no his faither and mither's son, and robbet of his just inheritance.\" \"A douce, sponsible gentleman, deprived o' his richts by a beggar's brat from France, pawnded on my lord Duke while he was yet in the body, and his browster's wife o' a duchess.\" The moment the two had crossed the rubicon and entered the House, it was \" Come away, Lady Marget,\" from the more polite lips of a host of acquaintances and allies. \" Good morning to you, Miss Erskine. The benches for the ladies are the farthest forward on the left side in the inner room. Let me conduct you. It is the domicile they are sitting on the now, whether Sir John and Lady Jean did bide the time asserted at Rheims, and which hotel they occupied in Paris.\" The great hall of the Parliament House, with its magnificent carved ceiling heavy with royal shields and coats-of-arms picked out in red, blue,"], [26, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 22 and gold, with the consummate skill of an ancient artificer, a monument of national dignity, was, in those days, parted off, as a rule, into an outer and an inner court. The outer was given up to no more distinguished service than that of pro viding tables for the law-stationers and their wares. The inner was the supreme court of justice for the country. But there was yet a sanctum within a sanctuary \u2014 a small room, into which the judges, sometimes to the number of fifteen, as on the present occasion, were crammed in order to hold their sittings. Under the pressing exigency of the notorious Douglas case, the temporary partition between the outer and inner courts had been removed ; so had the stationers' tables, and the empty space was utilised by rows of well-filled benches, be tween and behind which was a standing company. Sitters and standers consisted of the elite of the Scotch nobility and gentry, the Provost and Bailies, the leading representatives of the different guilds, the more potent and wealthy merchant burghers, accustomed to dwell at close quarters among the citizens proper, and at the time to receive all honour and courtesy at the hands of the legal fraternity, from his Majesty's judges downwards."], [27, "IN THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE. 23 But Lady Marget and Jeanie penetrated to the sanctum of sanctums, the densely crowded, dingy little room, and were privileged to occupy ex cellent places, where they could see, and, if they chose, hear what was going on. Lady Marget was undisturbed, or only moved to a prouder carriage, a more commanding step and turn of the head, while she took every attention as her due. Jeanie Erskine was agitated and abashed, for she had gone less into society, and had led, by comparison, a retired, diligent, care-ridden life. The girls had scarcely seated themselves before the hawk's eye of Lady Marget detected the fact that the young man whose fortune and very name hung in the balance, together with that member of his junior counsel who meant to make a spoon or spoil a horn in the suit \u2014 the suns in the firma ment to these young women \u2014 were distinguished by their absence. \" They are not here,\" the sharp observer an nounced in an audaciously loud whisper to her companion \u2014 \"neither Jock Douglas nor Davie Elphinstone.

Lady Marget was more actively employed. She leant forward and even stood up, heedless of the muttered \" Sit down, my lady ; \" \" Keep your seat, mem,\" the better to study the assembly, and make a rapid calculation whether the faction favourable or that hostile to Mr. John Douglas's claims preponderated. What were the \" Sit downs \" and \" Keep your seats \" of the people behind, whose view she ob structed, to her ? If she had been called upon to defend her action, she would have coolly answered, \" Honest folk, I am Lady Marget Elliot, Teviot dale's daughter. Your concern in the trial is, as doubtless you are aware, nothing to mine.\" When Lady Marget's curiosity was satisfied, she proceeded to enlighten her friend with regard to points on which she might be ignorant, con cerning the principal persons present. She first indicated the Bench, with its portentous double row of judges, writing and reading their notes, exchanging opinions on knotty questions in dis pute, taking snuff and sneezing with a sonorous ness befitting the dignity of the sneezers."], [29, "IN THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE. 25 \" Yon carle whispering under his neighbour's wig,\" said the irreverent young lady, \"is Montboddo, who thinks we are all but a stage removed from the monkey tribe.\" \" Lord preserve us ! \" cried orthodox Jeanie in horror. \" He has been one of the commission sent over to France,\" went on Lady Marget, composedly, as if well accustomed to the vagaries of men. \" He has been getting up evidence for Jock ; as if more evidence were wanted than that of his face and bearing !

Dutch ladies are all the fashion among the young advocates.

They say he's on now with a Miss Blair, a west-country heiress. She'll not have all her sorrows to seek in one day, if she take Jamie.\" \" What are the counsel reading ?

If so, he may shut his shop here. An advocate can ' dally with the Muses,' as literary folk say, for amusement or display of his intellectual tastes, but to take to writing history, like Mr. Hume, or plays, like John Home, is too much of a good thing, and more than his briefs are worth.

The pleading and the hearing of the evidence occupied twenty one days, and now the judges have been laying their heads together for the better part of a week. It is no common case,\" declared Lady Marget, with a certain pride, \"but they stand at straws. On the last occasion that I was here, it was Lady Jean's age, and whether she looked it, they were harping upon.

Upon my word, I think the brains of our old nobility must be softening, or we would not have so many oddities to point to among us,\" said Lady Marget, who would have been mortally offended if anybody save herself had expressed the same opinion. \" Tell me something about the ladies,\" requested Jeanie. \" Who is the muckle wife in brocade on the ladies' bench opposite ? \" \" Muckle wife, indeed ! That's her Grace of Douglas. Do you not know her ? She has been very forward in this suit, and I'm bound to say she's been a real good auntie to Jock. Between you and me, my lord Duke would never have owned his nephew, his sister's son, if the Duchess had not stuck up for him.

He could see so far that her Grace had no interest in the world in foisting a couple of pretenders upon him.

He's a single man too, without wife or bairn to egg him on. He would have been well enough pleased to let sleeping dogs lie. More by token, he was not always looked on as the Duke's heir. There was Sir Robert, who married Euphie Montgomerie. Sir Robert was nigh hand as near of kin as Mr. Andrew, and I have heard tell his Grace had a great work with Sir Robert at one time. But Euphie Montgomerie was a friend of poor Lady Jean's when they were both abroad, and Sir Robert was brought to take the part of Lady"], [34, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 30 Jean and her twin laddies, and to renounce his chances like an honest man.

Mr. Andrew would not have figured as the pur suer here, if he could have seen his way to keep out of it. But what would you have ? There's his Grace of Hamilton and Lord Linlithgow and ever so many old family friends \u2014 shame upon them ! \u2014 stuffing his ears with stories of fraud and roguery, persuading him that it would be a mean spirited thing to let a French impostor sit in his seat and own the estates and the Castle, and be the head of the house.

It is the talk that she made up her mind to marry him, and would take no denial. Her father and mother dared not stir a step in the matter. You see, they might have got ill will from the Duke and the rest of the clan, if the marriage had fallen through ; so she rode herself in the post-chaise, with his Grace's chaplain, to meet the bridegroom half way. They had to cross the Tyne, which was in flood, and the post boy refused to ford the river, for he said it was at the risk of their lives. But she whipped out a loaded pistol from the holster, opened the chaise door, sprang out, and mounted to the dickie like lightning. And she held the pistol to the post boy's head, till he forced the rearing horses through the roaring, reaming water. Her wed ding gown was splashed from head to foot. She tells to this day that there never was bride married with such draggled tails.\" \" She must have been a bold, wilful woman,\" said Jeanie, in strong disapproval, \" and I would have thought would have gotten cause to rue her bargain.\" \" No, she never rued it,\" said Lady Marget, unhesitatingly, \"and whatever her faults, she's a warm-hearted, sincere woman and a good friend.

Weak here, weak there, I should say, unless we're changed beyond recognition.\" \" Anyway, Lady Douglas did her best,\" sug gested Jeanie. \" That did she, better than seeing visions. She travelled all the way to France, to find the rights of the story, and her without a word of the French, or any other language, save her own good Scots.\" \" How did she manage ? \" \"She took her mantua-maker, Mrs. Primrose, with her, and Mrs. Primrose's tongue would clip clouts, let alone the French.

She was a prominent person at her end of one of the benches. She was so assured of her consequence, that, an instant before, she had not scrupled to give a shrill, imperious summons to one of the senior counsel to come down and speak with her, just as he was stepping forward to read the evidence taken in France. Alas ! Prior's \" charming Kitty \" was no longer \" young,\" and the world in general did not over look her vagaries, as they were bound to be overlooked by the poets she patronised. The public said, without mincing matters, that she had been mad enough to be put into a straight waistcoat while she was yet Lady Kitty Hyde, and that she had led the man, who was rash enough to marry her, through the maze of a strange dance, till he had set his face to let her go her own way, disowning all responsibility for her caprices.

There was a hush went through the court as a piece of evidence of greater importance than what had gone before was brought forward. When it had been turned outside in, and looked at upside down, the interval for early dinner had arrived, and the proceedings came to a temporary cessation, the judges withdrawing with the alacrity, more or less ponderous, of mortal men. Their exit was fol lowed by the tumultuous, noisy dispersion of the main body of the disengaged lawyers \u2014 the flock of advocates, writers to the signet and solicitors, the most of whom resided in the immediate vicinity, packed in the High Street or some of its closes, or even renting rooms above the Luckenbooths"], [46, "42 LADY JEAN'S SON. for the convenience of an easy attendance at court. There was a general hubbub, hitherto subdued, with craning necks, trampling feet, talk and laughter, as a prelude to a widespread exodus, notwithstanding some of the audience, aware that they were not privileged to command good places, kept the seats they had struggled for earlier in the day, refreshing themselves with such food and drink as they had taken the precaution to bring with them in bags and baskets. Lady Marget and Jeanie Erskine were not constrained to remain ; they retired with easy minds. They did not venture to go so far off as their homes ; they found a comfortable refuge in the first friend's house which turned up, where they could not only rest and be refreshed, but were in a position to hear society's freshest gossip on the trial. It was on the girl's return to the court, as other contingents of the company were pouring in, while the judges had not all reassembled, and the ladies' benches were still half empty, that the two friends had a personal opportunity of con ferring with the principals in the suit, and con doling with them or congratulating them, as humour moved the speakers. The first who approached and saluted the"], [47, "THE PURSUER AND THE DEFENDER. 43 young ladies was Mr. Andrew Douglas, of Douglas Place, the pursuer in the action. He was assailing the position of Mr. John Douglas, the defender. To him, as to his nephew and nearest of kin, the late Duke of Douglas, at the instigation of his Duchess, had left all his great estates which could go by heirs female, together with the grand historical Castle of Douglas, fit residence for kings and princes, in which in the course of its long, eventful history, kings and princes had found refuge before now. Mr. Andrew Douglas and his faction \u2014 among the nobility and gentry rather than among the rude commons, who have, in their very rudeness, a hearty appetite for romance, the more thrilling the better \u2014 sought to prove that Mr. John Drummond Douglas was no son either of Sir John Drummond or of his deceased wife, Lady Jean, sister of the late Duke. They would have it he was a sup posititious child, so far as noble parentage was concerned ; in reality, the wretched offspring of miserable French parents. These were the poorest of the poor, the very scum of a village in the corrupt neighbourhood of Paris, since the parents were reported to have sold their infant child, in order to get rid of the burden of his main tenance, rather than to aid the machinations"], [48, "44 LADY JEAN'S SON. of a villainous foreigner in rank far above theirs. Farther, Mr. Andrew Douglas with his friends and counsel, had bound themselves to prove beyond doubt that the so - called Mr. John Douglas's twin brother Sholto, who had died at the age of five years, was also no son of Sir John and Lady Jean's, as had been asserted. He was another French pauper, bought and carried off from his kindred and country, with the intent that he and his brother might be foisted on the late Duke of Douglas as his nephews and heirs. In the light of these cruel and terrible alle gations, Jeanie Erskine, who was no woman of the world, quivered with repugnance and paled with anger, as Mr. Andrew Douglas approached her and her companion. Jeanie turned her shoulder and frowned upon him with as for bidding an aspect as it was possible for her soft, pleasant young face to assume. Lady Marget might adopt a temporising, time-serving attitude, if she chose, but Jeanie Erskine was not going to bestow smiles and civil words on an elderly man who was playing so base a part for his own aggrandizement. Yes, she held it was base to dispute an aged father's oath and a dead mother's tears and prayers ; she had set her tender heart on Mr. John Douglas being shown"], [49, "THE PURSUER AND THE DEFENDER. 45 to be the lawful heir. This was partly because all the ardent, artless young hearts in the kingdom were on his side. They would not believe for a moment that it was for the honour of his family and the credit of his house, that long-backed, stiff-kneed, slow-spoken Mr. Andrew Douglas had set his machinery in motion. But there was a more selfish and personal motive at work, even with innocent Jeanie. The bold young advocate, David Elphinstone, had been wooing the womanly lass off and on for two years, though Jeanie was barely eighteen. Her father set his face against her suitor, ostensibly because of the lightness of his purse, and the heavy claims on the by no means over-well-filled purse of Mr. Simon Erskine. And it was true that Jeanie would have small chance of wedding the man of her choice, before both their heads were grey, unless by some brilliant coup de main he won his professional spurs. The opening was afforded him by the Douglas case, in which he was one of the junior counsel. If the case were won for Mr. John Douglas, and David Elphinstone achieved such distinction in it as a junior counsel could attain to, by unslumbering diligence, re sourceful ingenuity, and sledge-hammer eloquence ; if in addition he secured the powerful patronage"], [50, "46 LADY JEAN'S SON. of Douglas of Douglas Castle for ever and a day, then Mr. David Elphinstone would enter at a gallop on a fair practice, with every prospect of his dying a judge. No father in his senses could refuse his daughter's hand to such a fortunate young man, who had moreover an honourable reputation, and was desperately in love. Jeanie marvelled at, and was even a little hurt by, the cool ease of manner and high-bred courtesy with which Lady Marget received Mr. Andrew Douglas's greeting. \" How can she ? How can she ? \" cried this rabid partisan under her breath. \" I ken she loves Jock Douglas as she loves her life, and will wed him without fail if he gain this process.

He whom he called father has succeeded to his brother's place of Murthly, and so has been saved from dying a dyvour's death.

But that would be a drop in the bucket to Lady Marget and her kin. How could he, a worse than nameless man, with the stigma of his lost suit upon him, claim to wed with the acknowledged beauty of the town (not tocherless either, though Teviotdale is not a rich nobleman), and the only daughter of as proud a family as is in Scotland ? The thing is not to be thought of for a moment. As he is modest and manly he could not spoil her chances, and hold her to such an unequal match, though she were willing. I can see all that plainly, but it beats me to comprehend how she can, while the battle is still being fought, bandy words with his sleekit, sneck-drawing adversary, and ware smiles upon him.\" If Jeanie had been in circumstances to seek an explanation from Lady Marget, she would have looked Jeanie in the face, and answered com- posedly, as she answered later, \" What for no, Jeanie ? The man is but seeking his own. He is free to do that, and it was not his wyte that his agents in France have played dirty tricks, and taken unfair advantage of their opponents. Mr. Andrew is magnanimous enough to declare that if his presumed cousin is proved to be the lawful heir of the late Duke, he, Mr. Andrew, will be the first"], [52, "48 LADY JEAN'S SON. to acknowledge him, and to make no farther difficulty. He says farther that if his agents are convicted of not having clean hands in the matter, and if they are demonstrated to have been guilty of roguery on their own account, he will disown their malpractices, and accept any sentence the court may award in condemnation of their misdeeds. Now, can a man, though he is Jock Douglas's rival and foe, speak fairer than that ? \" After all, Mr. Andrew Douglas was a personable enough man for his fifty and odd years. The costume of the day was still more in favour of middle-aged men than of lads. It lent a stateli- ness and dignity even to commonplaceness and mediocrity. There were reservations to the state- liness, no doubt. The knee-breeches, which ex- posed the slightly bowed and spindle legs ; the buckled shoes, which called attention to the huge splay feet, were among the number. But the long brocade or velvet coat and long vest, gave breadth to a spare figure. The lace cravat wound itself judiciously round a scraggy neck. The cauliflower wig \u2014 beginning to be curtailed into the bag wig, or if the wearer wished to be in the highest fashion, the grizzled hair brushed back, with an additional dash of white imparted to it by careful pomatum ing and powdering, and tied with a ribbon \u2014 was"], [53, "THE PURSUER AND THE DEFENDER. 49 not unbecoming to a country laird who, if lantern jawed, had on his high cheek bones the hale brown and red of an honest and, for the most part, an open-air life. Mr. Andrew Douglas's conversation with the young ladies was naturally hampered, for he was well aware that he was speaking to two sworn allies of his enemy's. He could only touch in the most formal and cursory manner on what they were there to see and hear \u2014 the great Douglas case on which fifteen learned judges were sitting, while a crowd, the best in the land, not to speak of the populace without, were waiting to learn the upshot. Poor Mr. Andrew had to steer clear of the \"ferlie\" of the day, which he could not com prehend any more than his neighbours could, though it concerned him so nearly. He had to content himself with speaking of the long drought, with inquiring for \"the pains\" in Lord Teviot dale's lame knee, and asking if Lady Teviotdale proposed to be present in the House that after noon ? Then he had to furbish up and marshal, in his deliberate way, his old-fashioned compli ments to \"the fair,\" and his remarks on their lending their countenance, in modern times of peace, to the speaker in the hall, as to the soldier in the field, in bygone fighting days. D"], [54, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 50 But though Mr. Andrew might be a trifle dull and a little absurd, there was nothing either unfriendly in tone or unworthy of a gentleman in what he said. When he made his bow and moved away, Lady Marget, who had played her part in the conversation with sufficient amiability, looked with a mischievous challenging glance in her companion's face. \"Why are you so glum, Jeanie? What ails you at Mr. Andrew? He's a worthy enough gentleman, and he's not held so stupid by men, as some folk think him. He's an authority on planting and draining. He's at his worst among women, with his scraping and bowing and long-winded gallantries. I've known him all my life. The Douglases and the Elliots have not been near neighbours, nor have they been always on the same side in politics, for you ken we Elliots, root and branch, have been Whigs, and the late Duke of Douglas was well known to have been in communication with the rebels. He narrowly escaped having to cross the water, after the last rising, twenty years syne. Still, the Elliots and the Douglases have always kept on good terms, and it seems not unnatural that there should be an alliance between them.\" She stopped medi- tatively. A shadow fell on her face with its high spirit in every line, and its brilliant youthful"], [55, "THE PURSUER AND THE DEFENDER. 51 bloom. \" Do you know, Jeanie Erskine,\" Lady Marget resumed in a low set tone, as if she spoke of necessity and half against her will, while a grey tint stole into the crimson of her carnations, and a look of her mother \u2014 the Countess, with her hard code and her worldly-wise maxims \u2014 came into the daughter's eyes. \" If bowls do not roll rightly, if Jock Douglas is beaten, stripped and cast out, my heart will be broken \u2014 broken, yet I'm not sure that in this case Mr. Andrew Douglas may not come to be the best of my belongings.\" \" Never ! Lady Marget,\" exclaimed Jeanie, con founded and indignant. \"Never is a long word,\" said Lady Marget, shaking her head with its funereal feathers. \"You must mind my heart will be dead and buried long ere then. I must wed somebody, so why not Mr. Andrew Douglas as well as another? I must wed to be a credit to my family, and to help my brothers \u2014 Jeddart, who will be the head of the house ; and Robbie, who is only Jock the Laird's brother, but is a fine chield for all that.

There will be plenty of pickings at Douglas Castle to help to set up the lady's younger brother, if he should choose to farm like a gentleman instead of pushing his fortune in the army or the navy (the Elliots have aye had a liking for the salt water), or going off to lay his bones in some God-forsaken spot, like Darien.\" Jeanie did not say a word ; she sat with a kind of frozen horror in her eyes, which half tickled, half piqued Lady Marget, in her changeable moods. \"Jeanie Erskine,\" Lady Marget began again, \" if you will not run away or take the half merk with Davie Elphinstone, as I dare say he has hinted at ere now, because of your duty to your family ; if you're going to run the risk of ending your days, a maiden-lady in a garret, to serve your father and his younger bairns, why should not I marry an honest man with the finest castle in the south-west of Scotland, to please my father and mother and profit my brothers ?

What was there to say, according to her ideas ? \" Cheer up, Jeanie,\" Lady Marget adjured her in another key ; \" the day's not lost yet.

But all that finery with which his noble patronesses of Douglas and Queensberry took care that he should be provided, might be donned advisedly, to enhance his good looks, and demonstrate beyond the possibility of contradiction, that such a face and figure could not belong to the son of a French glass-blower. He had the makings of a fine man in him, like his reputed father, Sir John Drummond, and a re semblance might be found between them, by eyes put on the track ; but it was never said that there was such a likeness where father and son were in question, as that which was repeatedly sworn to as having existed between his fair-haired mother and his twin brother who had died in childhood. For that matter, if it was hard to believe that John Douglas had derived the attributes of grace and elegance \u2014 generally ascribed to gentle birth"], [59, "THE PURSUER AND THE DEFENDER. 55 and breeding, which were conspicuous in his person, from a French artisan, it was as hard to say whence the young man had got other marked traits \u2014 his calm, reasonable grey eyes, his firm, though sensitive mouth. These never came from Sir John Drummond. He had been a handsome man in his day, but he had roving, shifty eyes, and a weak, sensual mouth. A swaggering, pro digal air still lingered about his unwieldy, over grown bulk and his swift progress to bodily and mental infirmity. The stamp of his youth had not been effaced by his acquisition, late in life, of solid means and indisputable social rank. Neither did John Douglas owe his look of sense and discretion, for his years, to his ill-fated mother. She had been chiefly distinguished for her great aristocratic beauty, her helplessness, her ill-advised, gracious prattle and general impru dence and incapability, which, like her beauty, had endured long beyond the ordinary bounds of girlhood, or what is sometimes the second girlhood of elderly spinsterhood. As Lady Marget had asserted, John Douglas must go farther back than his immediate predecessors in order to trace the source of his precocious strength of will, clearness of judgment, and power of self restraint. These desirable qualities were plainly"], [60, "56 LADY JEAN'S SON. to be seen in those early days, and they were to be still more conspicuous in years to come. No doubt he had been reared in a remarkable school, each stage in which had presented new opportunities for gaining knowledge of men and the human heart, and for practising self-discipline and discretion. Never had boy or lad passed through more amazing changes of fortune. Naturally he could not remember his baptism, when the bells of Rheims cathedral were rung, and the good silver money with which his parents were scantily endowed, was freely scattered among the shouting populace in honour of the event. But he had a dim recollection of the sorry time in London, when Sir John and Lady Jean came to England. Sir John was lodged in the King's Bench prison, to which his twin sons were carried by their nurse and their mother to visit him. Lady Jean had to pawn whatever jewels she still possessed, and even a part of her clothes, to pay for her lodgings, to feed herself and her small household, and to furnish her husband with the little luxuries of which he was always ready to avail himself. He was content to do nothing for her in return, save fill her snuff-box with choice rappee, and drink her health on her birthday, with the Burgundy procured at her expense."], [61, "THE PURSUER AND THE DEFENDER. 57 Poor, harassed, simple-minded woman ! she had to take upon her feeble back much the heavier load of the family cares. She had still sufficient influence, through old family friends and her social rank, to get, as her son learnt when he was able to understand it, a letter in which she prayed for assistance, presented to the Prime Minister and by him shown to the King. The result was that a pension of three hundred a year was granted to her. It was the amount of the allowance originally made to her by her brother the Duke of Douglas, but withdrawn by him when he was told of her imprudent marriage. Three thousand instead of three hundred pounds would not have sufficed to discharge the debts in which Sir John, or Mr. Drummond, as he was then, had been drowned for many a year, or to meet the obliga tions which his wife was as ready to incur as if the wide lands of the Douglases, held by the childless Duke, were already in her possession. The straits of the family continued not less desperate than before, and John Douglas retained a vivid impression of going a six days' journey in the coach from London to Edinburgh with his mother and little brother, when they were attended only by the children's nurse, Nelly, who had been Lady Jean's trusted, confidential maid for the"], [62, "58 LADY JEAN'S SON. whole of her ladyship's life. The young man could also recall, without any difficulty, the day when he and his brother were dressed in their best, and carried by their mother, in a high state of expectation and excitement, back to her old home of Douglas Castle, when the great gates were shut in their faces and Lady Jean wept and wailed, and then held up her head again, and retraced her steps with the dauntlessness which was part and parcel of her high degree. He had not forgotten Mistress Euphie Montgomerie coming in Lady Jean's absence and carrying him and little Sholto from Nursie's garret to Euphie's brother's house in the west country. Neither had he lost sight of his first introduction to his aunt, the Duchess of Douglas, or his first meet ing with his uncle, the Duke, when he, Jock, and Sholto were found trespassing in the Castle gardens. He had never seen his mother again, for the poor soul had died in the garret in Bishopland before the glad tidings could reach her that her brother, the Duke, had acknowledged her sons. Afterwards the Duke wavered, according to his sickle, cross-grained nature, and there was great discord between him and the Duchess"], [63, "THE PURSUER AND THE DEFENDER. 59 in the course of which it was thought more prudent by the friends of the children that they should be kept out of the Duke's sight. It would have exasperated him to a blind fury had the boys found refuge with Sir Robert and his wife Euphie. Accordingly Jock and Sholto were sent back \u2014 for, what it was hoped would be, a brief space of time \u2014 to Nursie and her garret. There the little sickly Sholto fell ill with a fever and died. Jock was left alone, and would have been desolate indeed, in spite of the devotion of Nursie, had not a charitable woman of quality, one of his mother's old acquaintances, offered to take him and care for him, in a manner befitting his rank, till his father could claim him. Thus he ate the bread of charity, and was an innocent hanger-on of his benefactress, spoilt by the good-natured, and cuffed by the surly among her retainers, in an ambiguous and trying position, which might have continued long enough before room could be made for him in the King's Bench. As it was, the debtor's prison ceased to hold Sir John when he succeeded to his brother's baronetcy and estates of Murthly. These good things would descend of necessity to Sir John's elder son by his first wife, Charles Drummond, Jock's half brother. But to do the improvident father justice,"], [64, "60 LADY JEAN'S SON. he effected what he could for the younger boy. Sir John claimed his son, charging the estate \u2014 the grown-up son and heir, Charles, consenting \u2014 with a provision for the lad, and seeing that he was educated in a manner suitable to his station. Jock Douglas's cause had been already espoused warmly by his aunt, the home-spun, friendly Duchess of Douglas ; the Duke in time repented anew of his harshness, and before he died made a formal will and constituted his nephew his heir. And here was the concluding chapter in the strange, eventful history. Young Douglas's birth right was contested by the next of kin, old Andrew Douglas, egged on and backed by a powerful faction of the nobility and the great lawyers. A no less powerful faction of all classes stood by the defender and maintained the justice of his claim, while all the undeserved humiliation and wretchedness of his past, all the sins and follies of his progenitors were raked up once more and exposed afresh to the public gaze. Young John Douglas's story was one of the most remarkable, and he himself was one of the most perfect heroes that ever romance-writer fancied and framed. There was no lack of eager conversation where"], [65, "THE PURSUER AND THE DEFENDER. 61 Douglas and these two, among his many fair friends, were concerned. How was the day going, on the whole ? Were the judges not convinced of the shameful malpractices of Mr. Andrew Douglas's agents in putting in force French law against Scotch subjects, so that he had got the case taken up by the iniquitous Toumelle, one of the most corrupt of King Louis's corrupt courts of justice ? And there was another bone for the judges to pick : these wicked men, Mr. Andrew's agents, had succeeded in moving the Archbishop of Paris to issue a monitaire against the alleged culprits, so that the terrors of the Church, in addition to the severities of the law, threatened every French witness who dared to tell the truth as to what he or she knew on the momentous subject. Could nobody, oh ! could nobody un ravel the mystery of the two French infants who were said to have been carried off from their mean and poverty-stricken homes ? A woman who sold books at the gate of Notre Dame was reported to have helped Sir John to his prey, though why he should have applied for aid in his nefarious project to so public a character, and why he should have doubled the risk of detection, and also doubled his offence, which was a capital crime in France, by kidnapping not one but a"], [66, "62 LA*DY JEAN'S SON couple of children, it might puzzle all the fifteen judges to explain. As John Douglas conversed quietly and calmly on some of the difficulties encompassing what was to him the tremendous stake at issue, Jeanie Erskine had the pleasure of hearing him refer again and again to \" my good friend Elphinstone, that clever fellow, Davie Elphinstone, who will see through a millstone, if any one will.\" After all, it was nearly poor Jeanie's only salvage where her personal concerns were in question, from the long hours of the day spent in being present at the trial. Davie Elphinstone was far too busy and intensely interested in his business to run the risk of failing the senior counsel and his client for a second, even to exchange a word with the mistress of his affections. The sight in the distance of his broad shoulders, where he sat with his back turned to her, his head bent forward, without an instant's relaxation of the tension of his attitude, his strong hands grasping and adroitly fluttering his papers, was about all Jeanie Erskine could get of him. Though she secretly thought that sight the most interesting detail within the bounds of the Parliament House, it was not very much, when everything was said and done. At the dinner hour, when the bulk of the"], [67, "THE PURSUER AND THE DEFENDER. 63 performers and the audience had alike taken a breathing-space, Elphinstone had unfortunately been seized upon by one of the senior counsel, carried off and detained by him till the play began again. Only once in the whole course of the weighty business on hand, had the young advocate been able to turn his head \u2014 which truth to tell, was covered, under the professional wig, with a thick shock of red hair\u2014 and afford a glimpse of his strong, irregular, but by no means unprepossessing features. For a moment he had peered searchingly with his strained and weary eyes, which were studying English and French depositions day and night, into the sea of faces presented to him. Then he had caught Jeanie's bashful glance, and returned it with just one \"blink\" of faithful regard. Like a crumb of bread and a drop of water to a hungry creature parched with thirst, was that solitary blink from manly eyes, which read her soul's secret and replied to it, with an answering secret open to Jeanie, as hers was to her lover. When she reviewed the circumstances, while she turned a deaf ear and answered at random to Lady Marget's flow of conversation, on her way back to the Hammermen's Close, she told herself that one blink from Davie Elphinstone's deep-set eyes"], [68, "64 LADY JEAN'S SON. was worth coming for. It was worth while leaving her \"huswife-skep\" behind, and sitting for the long summer day in the heat and hum of the inner court of the Parliament House, just not to miss that love-token."], [69, "CHAPTER IV. NANZIE* BOYD'S ILL NEWS. The house which Mr. Simon Erskine and his young family occupied in the Hammermen's Close, was not one whit worse than hundreds of similar houses or flats filled with genteel company, dotted promiscuously up and down other closes running out of the Canongate and the High Street, and set thickly among the mansions of the nobility, and the \" lands,\" let out in shops and tenements for the poorer tradesmen and working people. But a modern inspector of such buildings would be at a loss to tell how they could provide, even the most limited accommoda tion, for the different members of a tolerably large household. Mr. Simon Erskine was himself a portly man, who looked as if he wanted room for the squaring of his arms, in the snuff-brown coat-sleeves, somewhat threadbare at the elbows, and the crossing of his gaitered legs and gartered knees, even though he never moved from his seat * The English, \"Nancy,\" is pronounced in Scotch, \"Nanzie.\" E"], [70, "66 LADY JEAN'S SON. during the short time that he was in the bosom of his family. That family consisted of three wild laddies and as many light-hearted lassies in addi tion to Jeanie, who was the eldest of the second generation, an able-bodied servant lass, and a superannuated manservant, who had continued to follow Mr. Simon Erskine's never very pros perous fortunes. If the last was of little use otherwise, he served, at least, as a patent of gentility \u2014 to which Jeanie herself was not insen sible \u2014 in the eyes of her neighbours. What holes of bare attics served as sleeping apartments for those vigorous, blooming boys and girls, while the master of the house had no better room to boast of than a closet cribbed from the parlour. In the singleness of their hearts, the family called the den their father's \"sleeping closet,\" without an attempt at disguise. The servant lass was more than content with a box-bed in the kitchen ; as for her antiquated coadjutor, he laid his old bones, without a sense of injury, on a \" shake-down,\" or mattress, with the accompany ing sheets and blankets regularly put down every night, and as regularly taken up every morning, in the draughty passage outside \" the young gentle men's \" door. If they were minded to commence their High School pranks at break of day, or to"], [71, "NANZIE BOYD'S ILL NEWS. 67 protract them till the small hours, the workers of the mischief must have passed out and in over the prostrate' body of \" Auld Nick,\" an opprobrious name, the mere suspicion of which was a thorn in the long-suffering flesh of Nicholas Annan, the bearer. Even the parlour, which was the only sitting room for the entire family, was small and dark for the purpose. It was overlooked and over shadowed by a pepper-box turret, springing aggressively from the third story of the house opposite. In the very height of summer Jeanie's wheel, work-table, and knitting basket, which had descended to her from her mother, had all to stand in the recess of the window, otherwise it would have been impossible for her to command light for her spinning, sewing, and knitting. For a large proportion of the making and mending of household linen and family garments, from Mr. Simon's ruffled shirts and her own sacques and frills, down to the lassies' \" daidlies \" and the laddies' stockings, passed through Jeanie's diligent hands, as they had passed through her mother's. One reason why so much life, old and young, existed and throve within such narrow bounds was to be found in the fact that, with the excep tion of Jeanie, her next sister Ailsie \u2014 who had by"], [72, "68 LADY JEAN'S SON. fits and starts aspirations after being a grown-up young woman like her sister Jeanie, and began at intervals to be ashamed of running wild and going off to play with the other bairns \u2014 the servant lass, and Nick, the rest of the family lived for the most part out-of-doors in one quarter or another. They only sought the shelter of the family roof at meal times and during the night. Mr. Simon Erskine said grace and supped his porridge and ale, while his children supped their porridge and milk, called on Jeanie to truss his points and see that his cravat was in order, and started forth on the Lord Justice's service. He returned in time to call down another blessing on the kail and the mutton, or the beef and greens, or the cod and crappen-heads, which were disposed of with equal celerity, and returned to his afternoon's work, not to reappear till close on bedtime. It was not that he worked half as long, but like many worthy gentlemen of that day, he was in the habit of spending his even ings at his own particular tavern, where he met his cronies, drank his claret, read his weekly news paper, or took a hand at cards ; where there was more room for these operations, which were wound up by the dish of collops or tripe, the more frugal bread and cheese, or the Finnan haddie, that represented his supper. Summer or winter made"], [73, "NANZIE BOYD'S ILL NEWS. 69 no difference to the habits of the head of the house, any more than to those of his brood. Jock, Wat, and Harry did not stay in the house ten minutes longer than they were forced to stay. These miniature men, in their corduroy breeches tied at the knee, long stockings, shoes with buckles, little tailed coats and deep vests, were never unprovided with engagements which took the loons abroad. When they were out of the High School they were spieling the Castle Rock, sailing boats on the Nor' Loch, or seeking for plovers' eggs on the Burgh Muir, according to the season. Or the callants were making slides before the mansions of the highest nobility, or fighting pitched battles with snowballs under the very noses of the guardians of the peace \u2014 the city guard with their Lochaber axes. Or the bauld High School laddies were \" waiting on \" in the Parliament Close for the upshot of some notorious case, like that of the Douglases, or were attending the grisly spectacle of a hanging, as it was still celebrated for the public benefit. The lassies were little better, in their mob caps and long skirts, so far as domesticity was con cerned. They did not, indeed, spiel the Castle Rock or witness hangings, neither were they at liberty to stray as far as the Burgh Muir. But"], [74, "70 LADY JEAN'S SON. the youthful maidens were present at every show which took place in the Canongate or the High Street, whether the show was a wedding or a funeral, a march of troops from the castle, or the conveyance to the Tolbooth of an arrested high wayman or smuggler, followed by a shouting rabble. The procession of the Lord High Com missioner, with his train of blackcoats, to open the General Assembly of the Kirk, and that of the judges, when the court of session resumed its sittings, were yearly and familiar sights to these experienced sightseers. As to their private diver sions, they played at jing-a-ring and fal-lal or hop-scotch with their acquaintances in the nearest closes, quite as freely as their more humbly-born sisters engaged in these games. It was an altogether hardy, independent life, in which the young sprigs of quality, even of the gentler sex, engaged in that bygone auld Reekie. A credible witness has left his testimony that he saw one of the little ladies Eglinton riding on a sow, which was whipped up by her sister as the group pursued their erratic course in the principal street of the city. We have it on the best authority that the small daughters of Innes of Stow, Scott of Mailing, and Trotter of Morton Hall, waded with high glee in the \" Cowgate Strand \" when the gutter was in flood."], [75, "NANZIE BOYD'S ILL NEWS. 71 But it would be a mistake to suppose that these aristocratic damsels received no training. They were taught by their brothers' tutors and their mothers' waiting-maids (often daughters of the poorer parish ministers or schoolmasters), and by elder sisters like Jeanie Erskine. The girls went to school, as their brothers did \u2014 not to the same school, but to a seminary for \"young misses,\" generally kept by a starched spinster. She taught her pupils manners, the harpsichord, a little French \u2014 not at all bad, so far as it went ; she instructed them to draw patterns for ruffles and caps, to embroider the muslin for which the patterns were drawn. Included in her course were lace mending and fine darning, as well as advanced reading, writing, and arithmetic, with a trifle of geography and history thrown into the bargain. As the girls were nearing womanhood, they were put through a season of catechism and religious instruction by their father's chaplain or by the parish minister, whether of St. Giles, or the Tron, or the Tolbooth. They were then reckoned fully equipped for their entrance into society. Whatever the faults of the system, it turned out, without question, many a courageous, capable, ready-witted woman. The Erskines' mother was dead, so that a"], [76, "LADY JEAN'S SON 72 matron's responsibilities devolved on the eldest daughter. She was her father's housekeeper ; she was required to spend judiciously the extremely moderate allowance for the wants of the house hold. She sat at the head of the table. She was, as far as she could, a mother to the ob streperous troop of younger brothers and sisters. It was a trying task for so young a girl. It developed her womanliness to a degree beyond her years, and rendered her thoughtful before her time. It was a sufficient proof of Jeanie's sense of the duty imposed upon her, that she had never yet been tempted to yield to what Lady Marget had rightly divined was David Elphinstone's fiery impatience at the obstacles which divided the couple. For Jeanie's father had absolutely declined to listen to Elphinstone's suit, though not because of any objection to the suitor personally. Mr. Simon Erskine had said frankly, without a perception of selfishness in the reason he gave, that he could not spare Jeanie. The house could not be kept, her brothers and sisters could not get on without her. Elphinstone, when he prepared to take Jeanie away, did not consider \u2014 with the usual senselessness and lack of consideration of young men in the circum stances \u2014 that neither he nor Mr. Simon Erskine"], [77, "NANZIE BOYD'S ILL NEWS. 73 was prepared -to enter into any arrangement by which her place in the family could be supplied. Moreover, Mr. Simon Erskine did not believe that the reckless wooer, who had no private fortune, was able, by the scanty earnings of a junior counsel, to maintain a young wife with whom he would get no tocher. The father would not listen for a moment to projects in the air \u2014 how David Elphinstone was to turn his hand to anything and everything ; how he would join Harry Mackenzie in the papers he was about to bring out, or write for the London booksellers and the newsprints, with young Jeanie, forsooth, to copy his papers, keep the purse, and manage the outlay. She might do that in her father's house, where, granting there was little to spend, that little was sure as long as Mr. Simon Erskine's life lasted, but she should never with his consent embark on a more desperate enter prise. No, the pair must make up their minds to part ; they were young enough to forget a fancy, or they must let it stand by for, say, a dozen years, when it would be time enough to consider the matter again. It was the idle non sense of young folk, who did not know what wrestling with difficulty and facing poverty meant, to speak of such a step at the present"], [78, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 74 moment. Bide the dozen years, and Ailsie and the other lasses would be grown up, fit to take Jeanie's place, and the lads would be out in the world, and the billie Elphinstone would have made his way in the world, if he was ever to make it. Having given his decision, Mr. Erskine did not afford the slightest assistance in carrying it out. He was as completely quiescent here as he was in the housekeeping. He gave Jeanie the money he could afford, and left the girl to spend it to the best of her ability, to keep in here, to pay out there, and rack her youthful brains to get two ends to meet. It was not that he was a man of great mind who could not condescend to trifles. He had rather a turn for minor details in his business, just as Mr. Andrew Douglas, of Douglas Place, was pernickety in his laird's fashion about his farms and his fields, his planting and draining, his horses and dogs, and his very furniture, con cerns Jeanie held beneath a man's notice. Neither was it that Mr. Simon Erskine was sparse of speech. On the contrary, he had an inclination to prose on whatever interested him, to any listener he could find, even to a lass like Jeanie, during the short time he was in her company. But he had a rooted conviction that"], [79, "NANZIE BOYD'S ILL NEWS. 75 housekeeping and the superintendence of a family constituted the business of women \u2014 whether old or young \u2014 and that the sooner they learned their business, the better for all connected with them. If a man discharged the duties of his profession or trade, he was not to be fashed with domestic troubles, they were beneath his dignity. His implicit trust in his womankind had always con tained a subtle flattery, but it was a little over whelming. Life would have been easier if less honourable for them ; had the master of the flat in the Hammermen's Close not left them entirely to themselves, or if he had even permitted them to appeal to him. He was not a bad-tempered, far less a hard-hearted man, but his pride clung to the reflection that he had never needed to lift his voice in his own house, that everything was done for him there, while his word which was law was not heard within the four walls. Mr. Simon Erskine practised the same masterly inactivity and absence of intervention in relation to Jeanie's love affair. He trusted her and, for that matter, her lover, implicitly, in this also. He delivered his verdict, and then, as if it was beyond contest, troubled himself no more about the matter. He did not so much as forbid Elphinstone the house, or prohibit correspondence between the"], [80, "76 LADY JEAN'S SON. couple. Mr. Simon Erskine did not take any steps to keep the victims out of temptation. With a refinement in cruelty, of which the worthy gentle man was wholly unconscious, he imposed upon poor Jeanie the arduous obligation and thankless office of holding her hot-headed, strong-willed lover at bay. Soft and gentle as Jeanie was, and attached to the man whom she kept at a distance, she did it. All the reward she had in the mean time was her father's calm obliviousness of any gigantic effort on her part, and the unreasoning wrath with which Elphinstone would, on occasions, resent her sub mission to parental authority, and her refusal to support him in any rebellious attempt to set it aside. In this mood he would fling off from her presence whenever they had happened to meet, and take care not to cross her path again for weeks and months. Jeanie had undergone her trials, and life had been for some time a battle field, though she was not more than eighteen, ah ! but that was one of her great consolations ; she was young and he was young. There was no saying what might befall them yet. She believed in him, poor child, however \" thrawn his humour, whiles ; \" for was he not crossed in love as well as she, while, as everybody knew that was hard to"], [81, "NANZIE BOYD'S ILL NEWS. 77 thole ; and was he not striving to conquer fortune for her sake ? He had not been thrawn to such an extent that the blink of his eye had not spoken to her, as in the Parliament House yesterday. Accordingly Jeanie was sitting alone in the window recess of the Erskines' parlour after their early dinner, not feeling particularly depressed. She was able to recall late events with some satis faction. She was hoping and hoping that Mr. John Douglas would come off victor in the great suit. Then he and Jeanie's friend, Lady Marget, who was not of a fickle nature, but as steadfast as a rock, where she gave her regard, would not forget the unparalleled exertions of a certain re doubtable young advocate on their behalf. When Jeanie came to this point in her meditations, she began to hum softly over her seam Grizel Bailie's song, written in exile and adversity : \" Werena my heart licht, I would dee.\" There was one good thing belonging to the dark old closes, of which the Hammermen's was one \u2014 they were like the narrow streets of high houses in some ancient Italian town, cool and restful to the eyes in the greatest glare of sunshine. To be sure such sunshine, even in a northern version, was not a very frequent or oppressive accom paniment of the grey town, but when it did"], [82, "78 LADY JEAN'S SON. succeed in penetrating the gloom and lighting up outside stairs here, steep gables there, and a mas sive arch yonder, the most wonderful effects of light and shade were produced. In like manner when the moonlight on a cloudy harvest-night flickered in and out, and played hide-and-seek on the projecting door posts and in the deep recesses, the result was magical, and like nothing which was entirely of the earth, earthy. Jeanie was roused from her half-unconscious perception of the charming relief lent by the invading sunshine to the close, a perception which mingled with and irradiated her thoughts. She was sure she distinguished a familiar voice speak- ing to Eppie Caw and Nick Annan in the adjoin- ing kitchen. The voice was that of Nanzie Boyd, Eppie's predecessor in office. She was another sonsie, sensible, hardworking Scotch lass, true as steel, in the light of a retainer to an employer, while free of speech, not always mindful to keep her place, for that matter not always conscious that there was a place to keep, with a dash of self conceit and more than a dash of self-will. She had quitted the Erskines' service a few months before, on her marriage to a journeyman wright, with whom she shared a room in a vennel off the High Street. Many a consultation, many a"], [83, "NANZIE BOYD'S ILL NEWS. 79 confidence and anxiety Jeanie and Nanzie had shared when Jeanie had first taken the reins of government in her father's house. Young mistress and maid had been loyal friends and helpmeets, and the alliance was not dissolved by marriage. Cordial greetings and small gifts passed continually between the flat in the Hammermen's Close and the single room at the top of the land in the vennel. Nanzie was ready to run to the Erskines' assistance whenever work was throng, when pot luck was dispensed to patrons or cronies of Mr. Simon Erskine's, or when anybody was ill. If there was no special call for her aid, the humble ally was not the less welcome when she came, just to speer for the wellbeing of the family, to have a crack with Eppie and Nanzie's old fellow-servant Nick, and to see Mistress Jeanie, if she was not better engaged. Nanzie was burning to learn whether the Master's spring hoast had yielded to the warm weather ; whether young Wat had given over play ing truant in the fashion which had vexed his sister, without her being at liberty to complain to his father ; whether Miss Ailsie had mounted the top-knot which she had been threatening to set up the last time Nanzie gave the family a call. \" Come away, ben Nanzie ! \" cried Jeanie, without quitting her seat, while she raised the"], [84, "80 LADY JEAN'S SON. sweet, girlish treble of her voice to its highest pitch, and screamed out to the kitchen, for those were unceremonious days. \"My seam is pinned to my knee, so that I cannot stir, and I must finish it before the lads and lasses come in to their ' four hours.' I'm very glad to see you. I hope your man is as steady as ever, and that he has got the job to do at Lord Torpichen's. Wat is sticking in better to his lessons, and Ailsie lends me a hand with the sewing and the redding up oftener than she was wont to do when you were here ; but she may let the top-knot abe this summer, for she's off this afternoon to the Baillie's, to play at the chacks with Lilias and Bess, wearing out their carpets and crushing her own gown tails ! \" Jeanie was so full of the ordinary interests of the two houses, she did not notice that Nanzie, in her matronly curch and clean, short gown, with her tartan screen thrown back, was flushed and excited. \" It was about none of these things that I wanted to speak, Mistress Jeanie,\" said Nanzie, dropping her voice mysteriously. \" I was that fain to get word o' you, your lane, that I've fair forgot the dish o' sowens I was bringing for the maister's breakfast. My gude-mither brocht in"], [85, "NANZIE BOYD'S ILL NEWS. 81 a poke o' seeds from the Dairy Mill, and they've been lying in steep ever sin syne.\" \"Thank you kindly, Nanzie; sowens are very refreshing and wholesome in warm weather, and my father will enjoy them when you can bring them, they will keep fine till then. Sit you down and rest, and tell me your will.

For, of course, she, like every intelli gent member of her class and calling, had not lived years in the house in the Hammermen's Close without being perfectly an fait to the most private affairs of the Erskine family. F"], [86, "82 LADY JEAN'S SON. \" What is it, Nanzie ? \" inquired Jeanie, in a frightened whisper, growing pale and letting her seam fall in her lap. \" The last news I heard from the court was that there was a fair prospect of our \u2014 that is, of Mr. John Douglas winning the day.\" \" Weel, I can tell you, mem, you're a' lost,\" said Nanzie, leaning forward and speaking with the tragic exaggeration common to her class when they've an impending misfortune to an nounce ; \" you're a' lost, gin you dinna tak tent to what I've gotten to say, and gin you let thc grass grow aneath your feet in acting on't.\" \" But what is't, Nanzie, and how can you ken what is unbeknownst to one of Mr. John Douglas's counsel ?\" urged Jeanie, rebelliously, taking a little umbrage at the implication of superior knowledge and wisdom on the part of a young woman in Nanzie's position, and up in arms on the instant, for the honour of a certain junior counsel. \" It's just this, Mistress Jeanie,\" said Nanzie, taking pity on the girl's suspense, and linking together emphatically her own strong, rough brown fingers, on which the proudly-prized token, her wedding-ring, shone conspicuously ; \" there's mischief in the wind.

She hailed a manservant who was crossing at the foot of the stairs, and told him she must have a word with Lady Marget Elliot without an instant's delay. He must go and find his young lady and bring her to speak to one who had an errand that would not tarry \u2014 or he might say, Miss Jeanie Erskine at once, to save time. The man knew Jeanie perfectly well by sight, and told himself that she was Lady Marget's great friend. He was also sensible when he saw Jeanie's heaving breast and heard her faltering words, that Lady Marget would not easily forgive any dis respect to her \" maiden cummer \" or neglect of her requests. But he had to answer for what he did to another and still more formidable mistress, and he was worried and engrossed with the com pany in the house. In his uncertainty how to act, he took the most unadvisable step in the circumstances. In place of conducting Jeanie to Lady Marget's room, he showed her into the ante-chamber of the reception-room, in which the Countess's guests were assembled, and left her standing there, covered with confusion, and in an"], [97, "LADY TEVIOTDALE'S DRUM. 93 agony of perturbation, while he threaded his way among the moving groups, and amidst the din of tongues, in search of Lady Marget. The awkwardness of the situation did not lessen Jeanie's agitation, but she could not help seeing and hearing a good deal, through the open door into the shadow of which she drew instinctively. Opposite to her was the ungainly figure of the Duchess of Douglas, uncouth even in a flowered brocade, with row upon row of gold lace on her petticoat. She was at high words with another lady \u2014 a little old lady who occupied the same settee. Site wore nothing better than a plain black silk gown and mantle, with a \" boned \" caleche to protect the trembling head in its muslin cap. She had silver-rimmed spectacles on the high bridge of her nose to aid her failing sight, and an ebony stick in her mittened hand to support her tottering feet. If she had been asked and had chosen to answer, since the story was not one which the members of her family cared to discuss, she could have told the true version of the tragic bridal of Lammermoor, for the unhappy Janet Dalrymple had been Lady Stair's sister-in-law. Lady Stair's name had been brought forward prominently in the Douglas case. She had been compelled to give evidence, and had incurred no"], [98, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 94 little odium from the party of the defender in consequence. But old and feeble as she was, the ancient dame was quite able to defend herself. Jeanie could not listen to her in the mean time. To the girl's horror she heard Lady Teviotdale's chilling, grating voice put an audible question to the manservant. \" Who was it, did you say, Mungo, was asking out Lady Marget \u2014 Miss Jeanie Erskine ? Well, I've nothing to say against the young lady, except that she has got too far ben in this house, and is a bit forward for her age ; she ought to know better than to come uninvited and disturb company in this fashion. Tell her she'll have to wait till Lady Marget's disengaged.\" But it was not to Lady Teviotdale that the man had been sent with his message, neither was it to her he would have to answer for not delivering it. There was a young as well as an old mistress in Teviotdale House, Mungo had learned to his cost before now. Therefore when he was caught up by my lady the Countess, he took refuge in the cautious temporizing policy, of not \" letting on \" he heard her. He still continued his search for Lady Marget.

They were more familiar with the \"tappet hens\" and \" shelties \" of usquebah in the change-houses than with the tea-kettles and tea-pots of fine ladies. The gentlemen were ill at ease and bored, the old Earl was more than usually restless and irritable. It was not his fault that Lady Marget was not kept stationed at his elbow, for every alternate minute he cried querulously, \" Where is Marget ? I've tint my glasses, I cannot put my hand on my snuff-box. Send my daughter here, some body ; she can find what I want.\" And if Lady Marget had obeyed the summons with magical celerity, he would still have been as fractious as a child, while he complained, \" Meg, can you not keep my things together for me ?

Her lady mother might not mind the matter to speak of, she was case-hardened, and her heart \u2014 what was of it \u2014 had shrivelled up in the hardening process. She would still seek to carry out her prideful projects, though Lady Marget's ardent young heart was broken to bits ; but he was wae for his Marget. It was a relief, in the tension of public and private feeling, to hear one of the gentlemen refer to \" that rascal Wilkes,\" and quote what the last London newsprint had said of him. Then a lady not far off took up the ball, and spoke of the word which had just come from \" Lunnon \" of the marriage of the Duke of Buc cleugh to Lady Betty Montagu. But it did not need the fact that his Grace was the son of that very Dalkeith to whom poor Lady Jean's troth had been plighted in her young days, which were neither to-day nor yesterday, to recall the speakers to the engrossing topic of the hour.

No event, however interesting, had a ghost of a chance of keeping its ground for a moment, in this aristo cratic gathering, against the case which had been making the Parliament House and the good town ring throughout this month of July, and was drawing to its close, amidst many searchings and faintings of heart, and murderous threats from fierce partisans. The whole room, the whole town, was surcharged with electric influence. Sud denly the Duchess of Douglas and old Lady Stair's voices rose high above the hubbub of general conversation. \" It was a fell-like thing in you, my Leddy Stair,\" cried the deep voice of the Duchess, in the broad Scotch for which she was remarkable, even in the days when the native Doric still lingered on the tongues of the nobility and gentry, \" to gang and wyte a puir laud who never did you wrang, to help to cheat him o' his G"], [102, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 98 birthricht, and rob him o' his ain name, and so bring him, if you had your wull, to rack and ruin.

He spoke in dry, measured accents in the lull of the storm. \" I apprehend Mr. John Douglas will not be penniless whatever betide ; and he is so fortunate as to possess powerful friends, who will exert themselves in his behoof.\" At this moment Lady Marget appeared in the door-way, briskly demanded what Jeanie was doing standing in the ante-room, and straightway ordered her to come into the reception-room. Jeanie felt as if she had already run the gauntlet of eyes and tongues. She would have a friendly nod from the Earl, if the Countess did no more than bend her long neck stiffly in an ungracious salutation, and stare in strong condemnation of Jeanie's curtsey. There were plenty of people present, Lady Marget among them, who did not hold that Jeanie Erskine was \"a bit forward\" and needed to be set down. They were sure she had some parley for Lady Marget which would not keep. They knew Jeanie as a modest and discreet young gentlewoman, a good daughter and sister, and were ready to lend her their countenance accordingly."], [105, "LADY TEVIOTDALE'S DRUM. 101 \" I have a word to say to you, Lady Marget,\" whispered Jeanie. Lady Marget glanced sharply round, and then took her friend into a quiet corner which was empty for the moment. But first, before she asked any questions, Lady Marget held her sides, leaned against the wall, caught up and crushed between her fingers one of the corners of her worked muslin apron, and gave vent to a half stifled exclamation. \"Oh, Jeanie!\" she said, \"I thought I had a stout heart, but to hear idle folk talking over his affairs and mine, treating questions which are life and death to us, as if they were no more than the lightest talk of the town, is hard to bear.\" \"And it is hard to me, Lady Marget, to add to your trouble at such a time, by coming to you with fresh vexing tales,\" said Jeanie, with wistful, affectionate deprecation. \" What ! Have you heard something new ? Out with it, Jeanie, without drawing breath or standing on ceremony,\" cried Lady Marget, with flashing eyes recovering herself on the instant. She rose to the occasion, sniffing the scent of battle from afar, and like a high-bred war-horse champing his bit, till he was in the thick of the fight."], [106, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 102 Jeanie told her tale, and at first Lady Marget blazed up in incredulous wrath. \"It is a vile lie, Jeanie Erskine.

But it is well that it has been discovered in time, and not sprung upon us, like a mine, in the dark. We'll beat the knaves yet, and this trumped-up story will only add to their humiliation.\" Then her counte nance fell, and she leaned once more against the wall. \" If Jock Douglas is a beggar's brat, after all,\" she said in a faint, sick voice, while despair was in every line of her drooping figure, \"then God help him and me ! \" But this collapse was even briefer than the last. Before Jeanie could utter a word of comfort, Lady Marget was herself again \u2014 alert, yet calm. \" We must get speech of Davie Elphinstone or some of the other counsel without drawing bridle. Your clever lass was right there. Forby the danger, it does not consort with Jock Douglas's honour to keep such a rumour in the dark.\" Lady Marget drew herself up proudly ; then she quivered with pain, as she added quickly, \" But as to telling the story to Jock himself, and watch ing how he took it, I could not do it, Jeanie ; I"], [107, "LADY TEVIOTDALE'S DRUM. 103 would just die with shame and misery, whatever befell.\" \" There is the risk of rousing the opposite party's suspicions, too,\" said thoughtful Jeanie. \"Yes, we must avoid that.

THE SUPPER IN BLAIR'S CLOSE, Lady Marget arrived with a couple of sedan chairs at the door of the house in Hammermen's Close. She did not desire an escort to accom pany her and her friend up to the neighbourhood of the Castle in the gloaming \u2014 which might be considered nightfall, and yet was still clear with the peculiar, half-subdued light that can scarcely be called dusk, lingering long between sunset and darkness in the summer of the North. Therefore, it was in comparative solitude, and in freedom to follow each her own train of thought, that the two girls were carried by caddies, in the Teviotdale liveries, up the dark-browed, storied old streets.

What did the young girls stay to recall of Moray House, where Stewarts of the Moray family still dwelt ? These might, from the upper windows, look over the blue Frith to the green woods of Aberdour, where was the grey castle of their ancestor, the \" bonnie Earl,\" so piteously lamented. It was little matter to the occupants of the sedan chairs that this corner shop, opposite Niddry Wynd, had been tenanted only the other day by douce Allan Ramsay, wig maker and bookseller. This was thc greater wonder, since the girls were well acquainted with the Tea-table Miscellany and its songs, such as \"Within a Mile o' Edinburgh Town,\" \"The Bush aboon Traqhair,\" while one of the two could repeat whole passages of \"The Gentle Shepherd.\" It would not have occurred to Lady Marget and Jeanie, even if they had been less engrossed with their private concerns, to stop their progress, and step out from the high walls of their chairs in order to stare up at the beetling castle rock over which \"Mons Meg and her marrows\" held sway, or to gaze across the silver sea to the hills of Fife. The gazers would have found nothing remarkable"], [111, "THE SUPPER IN BLAIR'S CLOSE. 107 in the fact that the tall houses they were passing had terraced gardens running down to the big dark pool of the Nor' Loch. It might be better viewed at a distance than near at hand, yet it presented a pleasant, glinting mirror to reflect the setting sun \u2014 a mirror which would be missed when it came to the loch's turn to be drained. These were the most ordinary sights in the world to the favoured young women, and they were absolutely unconscious of them, in the tumult of anxieties which now swelled each burdened bosom. Lady Marget and Jeanie were borne along through what traffic still lingered in the streets, and did not stop till the caddies passed under a carefully carved coat of arms, and set down their light load in the semi-darkness of Mrs. Cockburn's oil-lit lobby. What did it matter for the darkness or the steepness of the worn uncovered stairs, when one thought of the feet which had passed up and down there ? Even Lady Marget in her day had classed Mrs. Cockburn and her friends as the best of company, little dreaming, all the same, of the hold which hostess and guests would take on future generations, when such grandees as the Duke of Queensberry and the Duchess of Douglas were well-nigh forgotten."], [112, "108 LADY JEAN'S SON.

The Jacobite swallowed up the Georgian, because victory lends itself to comedy, not tragedy, and is far less picturesque, poetic, not to say pathetic, than defeat. In this light the vanquished have the best of it. An old German cheil' seated on the English throne could not be expected to awaken the singer's enthusiasm like a young knight errant of a prince come to claim the land of his fathers. Nevertheless, the Whigs had the best of it, in substance if not in shadow, and Alison Cockburn wrote at least one heart-wiling, unforgotten song, when the chords of her heart were struck in a cause personal, not political. As her heart continued green, so her face did not fade, or faded with a mellow sunshine on it to the last. The auburn hair, which she wore over a high roll, never showed more than a thread or"], [114, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 110 two of silver among the gold, so that she could afford to substitute a Flanders lace handkerchief, tied under her chin, for the voluminous lace \"heads\" of her neighbours. She cherished an innocent pride in the fancy that she resembled Queen Elizabeth, because of her auburn hair and aquiline nose, and had the sleeves of her plum coloured sacque puffed in Elizabethan fashion, to meet the muslin neckerchief crossed over the bosom. But great Queen Bess, in her wisdom and might, though she had a witty tongue of her own, and the gentlemen of her household vowed she was the sun of the royal circle, had not an atom in common with this honest, large-hearted dame de salon, whose sympathies were so frank and genuine, who forgot her own losses to rejoice over her neighbour's gains. When she was \"old and cold,\" a widow and childless, she never failed in her perennial interest in her fellow-creatures, not only in the way-worn cronies of her youth, but in the new denizens of a new world, strong, gay, prosperous. She had as many friends among women as among men, among children as among grey-beards, among the poor as among the rich. A faint echo of her brilliant repartees, her quaint quips and jests, has descended through the generations. No saying of hers lacked point and"], [115, "THE SUPPER IN BLAIR'S CLOSE. 111 spirit, yet they were without sting, and left no poison behind. She was full of the milk of human kindness and charity, while she was a woman of birth and breeding, a woman of society, of letters, and still more of extraordinary personal and mental charms. Yes, if a parallel is to be sought for Mrs. Cockburn, it is necessary to cross the Channel to find it, for she was no more like Lady Mary Wortley Montague than she was like Queen Elizabeth. Mrs. Delany approached nearer to Mrs. Cockburn ; but Mrs. Delany, in spite of her accomplishments and her voluminous letter-writing, was less gifted ; the individual who came closest was the Marquise of Marquises. And if Alison Cockburn could not boast such exquisite vivacity, grace and tenderness as dis tinguished the noble, sweet Frenchwoman, the Scotchwoman was of stronger, sounder fibre, her standard was less worldly and more womanly, her morals purer, her principles firmer, her piety more reasonable. \" Come away, Lady Marget,\" cried Mrs. Cock burn, with the \" presence \" which was as genial as it was stately ; \" whom have you done me the pleasure to bring with you to-night? A young friend ? An Erskine from the Hammermen's Close, who keeps her father's house and looks"], [116, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 112 after her younger brothers and sisters, and has not so many ploys, I warrant, as befits her years? I think I've heard of her from some of my gossips. I'm blythe to see you, my dear ; I hope there will be enough young folk for you to have a round game, and be as merry as I would wish you to be. Whom am I expecting, Lady Marget? Just the old set, for the most part. There is one of the Balcarres bairns over from Fife. My niece, Anne Pringle, and her brother Mark, and some of the young Rutherfords are in from the Forest ; so is my sister-in-law, Lady Fair \u2014 you know she is one of our Dutch ladies, and is sometimes very droll in her speech when she means it least. Suff Johnstone may be counted on ; I hope she'll not frighten you with her mannish ways, Miss Erskine. She's a rough diamond, but she is a. diamond. Montboddo half promised to look in, if he could get away from his papers in time ; and Davie Hume may show face where there are so many Ettrick faces to keep him in countenance. Be sides, I'll not say that there may not be a wheen younger beaux casting up at the last moment from their chambers. I'm sure they would descend on Blair's Close in a flock, if they but knew who were here.\" \" In a flock, madam ? \" repeated Lady Marget ;"], [117, "THE SUPPER IN BLAIR'S CLOSE. 113 \" a flock of daws or corbies ? \" She accomplished the pleasantry by a desperate effort, while she was pricking her ears at the name of Lord Montboddo, one of John Douglas's senior counsel ; moreover, he was one of the commissioners who had taken evidence in France. \" Hear till her,\" exclaimed Mrs. Cockburn, delightedly. \" Is Saul also among the prophets ? Is a young lady to take my trade over my head and keep the men in order for me, in my sight and hearing ? \" The next moment she was hurrying away to welcome other guests, and Lady Marget was shaking hands with the Balcarres bairn, a well grown, elegant young woman. Lady Anne Lindesay was not so fair of face as her sister, Lady Margaret Fordyce, a London beauty, but she was still quite comely enough to be admitted into \"the beauty set,\" which figured during the season at the Edinburgh assemblies, and witty enough to take her place, when she desired the distinction, in \" the heartsome set,\" which, led by the masculine heroine, Miss Suff Johnstone, a habituie of Balcarres, performed a reel on the same classic ground. Lady Anne's wit was not such summer-lightning as played round the sweet, full lips of her mother's friend, Mrs. Cockburn ; but H"], [118, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 114 though it could singe, and even scorch its victims, it was not cynical enough to wound or slay them. For at its source was a spring of natural feeling, that could enter into the sorrows of rustic lads and lasses, and make them her own. It was one of the significant features of those days \u2014 racily rude and splendidly homely \u2014 that in this \" genteel \" sitting-room in Blair's Close were to be found that night two very fine ladies, one young and one middle-aged, each of whom had written a song for the people, which went home to their hearts. These songs have been sung in town and country, and across the seas, in the cottages of ploughmen and fishermen, the houses of yeomen and traders, in lairds' mansions and lords' castles, for more than a hundred years. Scotchmen, at home and abroad, will no more be Scotchmen when they cease to respond to \" Auld Robin Gray\" and \" The Flowers of the Forest.\" It did not matter that Alison Cockburn's set of \" The Flowers of the Forest \" was written with something of the artificial elegance and high-flown sentiment of the eighteenth century. The poorest peasant and scholar of John Knox's parish schools could relish the flowing measure of \" I've seen the morning, with gold the hills adorning,\" and realize the underlying pathos of"], [119, "THE SUPPER IN BLAIR'S CLOSE. 115 \"Tweed's sillar stream, drumlie and dark, as it rowed on its way.\" It did not signify that there were other verses, written by another woman of gentle birth, to the same tragic old refrain \u2014 verses, in their grand simplicity and graphic picturesqueness, more in keeping with the primitive subject, if not more piteous in their motive. It was of no consequence that Allan Ramsay wrote before, and Robert Burns after, Mrs. Cockburn and Lady Anne Lindesay ; and that a third, and yet a fourth gentle woman, Caroline Baroness Nairne and Joanna Baillie, took up the strains, and for the single songs of their predecessors, poured forth ditties by the score, full of mirth, full of plaintiveness, full of melody, immortal in their turn. The first two ladies held their ground. They had, without any vivid consciousness of the feat which they had accomplished \u2014 hardly knowing it, indeed \u2014 touched the chord which would vibrate in the national heart for all time. But it was not of \"Auld Robin Gray\" and \" The Flowers of the Forest,\" any more than of John Knox's house and Allan Ramsay's shop, that Lady Marget and Jeanie were thinking, when Lady Marget whispered a heartfelt \"Oh, that Montboddo would come ! I would make up to"], [120, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 116 him and take him aside, though he held me ever so near allied to a puggy.\" And Jeanie replied fervently, \" Oh, for Montboddo ! \" But, as ill luck would have it, no Montboddo appeared. There was the further difficulty that the girls could not avoid sitting down to play cards with all the junior members of the company, and such of the seniors as were not disposed to draw back their chairs, so as to form cliques of two and three, in which to have their cracks in peace. One might have thought that to be taken forcible possession of by the pressing importance of \" deals \" and \" pools,\" \" counters \" and \" odd tricks,\" would have afforded a welcome sense of temporary relief and variety from the monotonous burden of their cares. But Lady Marget's and Jeanie's nerves were set on edge, and tingling with the dreadful apprehension induced by Nanzie Boyd's story, and with the urgent call on them for immediate action, while they were gagged and fettered by their attention being claimed for the noisy business of the card-table. Thus two of the players were languid performers, to begin with. \" The last beauty of the town, Lady Marget Elliot, is giving herself airs. Though they do say she's engaged to Mr. John Douglas, it is ill manners to make a display of her vapours,\""], [121, "THE SUPPER IN BLAIR'S CLOSE. 117 was remarked, with the addition, \" Her friend, that demure puss, Jeanie Erskine of the Hammer men's Close, is following a bad example.\" Lady Marget's heart was sinking, until she had thoughts of feigning illness \u2014 an unbearable head ache, or the sudden coming on of a quinsy (her head was throbbing and her throat was parched) \u2014 and so making her escape ; but Jeanie was such an honest little fool, she would not see through the feint, and might make a work. Besides, there was still hope of Montboddo's and Davie Elphinstone's coming in at the last moment, with a fresh arrangement of the guests when the supper was handed round. Lady Marget dared not throw away even these slender chances ; she tried to divert herself during the interval of a deal by mentioning to Jeanie, who sat next to her. The stout gentleman in the brown coat, who still wore a bag-wig, and had a singularly well-pleased, tranquil expression on his round, comfortable face, was the man who denied the miracles. \" Mercy on us ! that fearsome man,\" cried Jeanie under her breath, with a mixture of awe and horror, for it had not then been discovered that the historian's scepticism was an intellectual mis fortune, and not a moral error. It owed its origin"], [122, "118 LADY JEAN'S SON. to nothing worse than a lack of imagination \u2014 after all, a grievous lack in a historian. \"Why does she let him into her house ? \" inquired the little bigot, \" though he is just like the other men of his years.\" \"Did you expect to see him with horns in his head and cloots for feet ? \" Lady Marget permitted herself to ask sarcastically. \" He was an old country neighbour of hers, before he went to France, like the rest of the clever men, and herded with the French philosophers, who believe in nothing, save what they can see and hear for themselves. They say he's a most obliging, agreeable man. What the better would he be of her showing him the back of the door ? He lets her think for herself, and why should she not grant him the same liberty ? Is banning unbelievers the proper attitude for Christians ? When it comes to that, I do not know that Mr. David Hume is more heretical in his opinions than that weary Mont boddo. Oh ! why does he tarry this night, of all nights ? \" \" If he would but come ! \" echoed Jeanie. Surely never had a crochetty old judge been so sighed for by two charming damsels in distress. Yet, if the truth were told, he was not the he to whom Jeanie's heart was going out in a desperate cry for his presence and counsel."], [123, "THE SUPPER IN BLAIR'S CLOSE. 119 The night wore on, a cruel night to Lady Marget and Jeanie, though it was clearly a merry and pleasant night to the old and young people, who were \" catching \" honours, getting rid of undesirable cards, bandying jests and laughter, and entering with zest into the graver conversation around them. No Montboddo came, and though his place was at last supplied by a better man \u2014 so far as Jeanie was concerned \u2014 it was' too late, and, as Lady Marget began to see plainly, Mrs. Cockburn's decidedly circumscribed parlour was not the place for delicate confidences. Therefore it was to comparatively little purpose that Davie Elphinstone's big person and equally big red head appeared in the doorway. No dressing and powdering, no arranging in side curls, according to the last mode for the hair on that big head, could do more than tone down its radical fieriness, just as no lessons prudently taken from a dancing-master, after the pupil was a grown man, could modify to any extent the heavy tread and the vehement gestures of the future judge. All the same, Jeanie's heart gave a great bound of profound thankfulness. It seemed a trifle at the moment that Jeanie and Lady Marget were so wedged into the circle surrounding a crowded card-table, that no dogged determination on the part of the newcomer, aided"], [124, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 120 by Lady Marget's masterful adroitness, could have got him so much as standing room in the girls' vicinity. The language of the eyes was still left to the lovers, and it was as if that were the only language Davie Elphinstone and his Jeanie were destined to interchange. He was not so reasonable and easily contented as she was. He stood in the background, looking full of exultant surprise the one moment, when he discovered the presence of the two young women, and of black gloom the next, when he recognized the impossibility of gaining access to them. As if to add insult to injury, where there was not space for him to edge in an elbow, another man had inserted his whole body. A handsome young Rutherford, established as if he had been on the spot for half his lifetime, and had the best right in the world to occupy it, was seated at Jeanie's right hand, advising her how to play her cards, and proposing to be her partner for the last round. And it was not in Jeanie's nature to be otherwise than civil to the very civil-spoken gentleman, kin to the mistress of the house, who was doing his best to be of service to her. As for Lady Marget, she was really doing nothing, either to help herself or any one else. She had changed her mind, and was resigning"], [125, "THE SUPPER IN BLAIR'S CLOSE. 121 herself drearily to the inevitable, in reference to the supper party in Blair's Close. Mrs. Cockburn, in her catholicity of temper, had partisans of both sides in the great suit, under her roof and at her table. The same tolerance had been practised at Teviotdale House that afternoon, but with a differ ence. So clearly was the liberal and courteous nature of the hostess borne in mind by her guests, that nobody attempted to outrage it by starting a forbidden topic, or by raising passions which were under decorous restraint. In addition to this obli gation, there was no lack of topics among the intel lectual company. They might be interested in the enthralling case, but they were not confined to it. They were not even limited by the fashionable events of the hour. The affairs of Edinburgh did not engross the speakers, though they were ready enough to discuss them in passing \u2014 how the first stone of the first house of the new town had just been laid by Craig the builder; and how the famous aloe, which was seventy years old, was about to blossom in the Physic Gardens. The prospects of the country, in its crops and cattle, did not exhaust the conversation. Even London politics did not round it off impressively. There was Mr. David Hume ready to talk daring French philosophy, within bounds. There were Mrs."], [126, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 122 Cockburn and Lady Anne Lindesay, and Miss Suff Johnstone, though Miss Suff was but a free thinker, prepared to contradict him when he over stepped these bounds, and to tackle him on his history. Mrs. Cockburn and Lady Anne had belles lettres at their finger ends, from the works of Pope and Addison to those of Dr. Goldsmith. His elegant ballad of \" Edwin and Angelina\" was about to come out in the Scots Magazine, to which young James Boswell was, by his own account, the most highly-prized contributor. There was but one exception to the polite reticence of the company on the burning question of the day. In a lull of the conversation, a harsh, powerful voice was heard to protest, in accents of authority, \" He's nae mair a laddie o' Leddy Jean's than he's a laddie o' mine.\" Nobody accepted the challenge, and no notice was taken of the offence. It was passed over even by the high-spirited hostess, who, kindly as she was, could defend and maintain her tactics. For great licence was allowed to the hardened offender \u2014 no other than Miss Suff Johnstone. She did not bring her man's jacket and her man's shoes to a supper party, but her company gown was of the oldest fashion, and the most unbecoming style ; while she did not fail to sport the overbearing, uncouth"], [127, "THE SUPPER IN BLAIR'S CLOSE. 123 manners which balanced her masculine strength of mind and shrewdness of intellect. Lady Marget disdained to make any observa tion on the gross infringement of good breeding, beyond the listless aside to Jeanie that the lady would be better employed at her horse-shoeing \u2014 her favourite recreation \u2014 than in volunteering an opinion which was not asked for in polite society. Deliverance dawned for at least two of the victims from the manners and customs of this same polite society. Mrs. Cockburn's quick, sym pathetic glances caught sight of a pair of wistful, drooping eyes, resting mechanically on the cards, held with spasmodic tightness in a trembling, mittened little hand ; and another pair of eyes, glowing and glowering, in their resentment, from a convenient station for receiving all manner of false impressions, and for indulging in any amount of jealous, unfair suspicions. Mrs. Cockburn smiled, and sighed to herself with perfect com prehension. Her motherly heart wandered to her son Adam \u2014 no more than a subaltern in a march ing regiment, yet already cherishing a desperate attachment for his cousin, Anne Pringle. Alison Cockburn's thoughts strayed farther back still, to the young painter, John Aikman, with his winning tongue and his eloquent pen and pencil. It"], [128, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 124 was many a year since all that was mortal of him was laid to rest in his quiet grave among the Forest hills, when young Alison Rutherford, sitting in her turret-room at Fairnilea, and know ing that John Aikman's head was lying low, had held truly that \u2014 \" The Flowers of the Forest are a' wede away.\" Mrs. Cockburn, as mistress of the house and the situation, signed imperatively to Robbie Ruther ford to vacate his seat, and motioned to the ireful, unreasonable young man who was one of her \"joes \" to take it, in a manner that, from the giver of the feast, admitted of no contradiction. It was too late in point of time, and too perilous in point of surroundings, for business. Lady Marget took the precaution of whispering to Jeanie. The next moment she had a grim conviction that the prohibition was unnecessary. She was not sure that the two, on the other side, had not forgotten every word about her and Jock Douglas, and the great case in which Davie Elphinstone was a junior counsel ! She believed they had lost sight of every other consideration in the consciousness that they were together there, the couple sitting with their heads so close that you could have put them under one bonnet ; Jeanie, red as a rose, listening, as if she could never tire,"], [129, "THE SUPPER IN BLAIR'S CLOSE. 125 to confidences of all Davie Elphinstone had been thinking and doing for the last two or three months \u2014 confidences which seemed not likely to come to an end. Then the two were partners in the game, and he was making such a pool for her as no other pair of partners could rival. The lovers were quite beyond caring for the sly, amused glances cast upon them by their neigh bours. \" The fond fools ! and Davie Elphinstone to be a man of sense,\" reflected Lady Marget, sardonically, and all the more her mind flew to Jock Douglas in his tottering fortunes, while it needed the utmost efforts of her better nature to keep her from growing green with envy. It was the same through Mrs. Cockburn's modest \"hand-about\" supper of carved roast hens, jam puffs, wet fruit and dry, with claret and whisky punch for the gentlemen, and negus for the ladies. When it came to toasts and sentiments, the King's health was drunk, first by his subjects, as in duty bound, with full purpose of doing honour to King George \u2014 on the part of the Whig hostess and her Whig guests, and with but the surreptitious move ment of a glass across a water-jug, to save a Tory's conscience. Mrs. Cockburn cheerfully overlooked the action, for are not the winners in a game bound to grant grace to the losers ? Davie"], [130, "126 LADY JEAN'S SON. Elphinstone had the recklessness to give for his toast, \"What each heart craves,\" with an auda ciously appropriating glance at Jeanie ; and Jeanie in her confusion could find no other sentiment than \" A warm heart and a leal ! \" The couple were not done with their \" toying,\" an indignant onlooker remarked to herself, even after they had taken leave of their hostess and when the members of the party, breaking up in the sma' hours, had set out on foot and in their chairs for their respective homes. Advocate Elphinstone walked by the side of Miss Erskine's chair, and left Lady Marget Elliot to the care of others. She bore him no malice, she simply bided her time and matured her plans. Poor young wretches ! she need not grudge them their brief experience of a fool's paradise. They were in little better plight than herself and him she wotted of. She dis missed her cavaliers, and caused her chair to be put down, by the side of Jeanie's, in the entrance to the Hammermen's Close, where she announced her will and pleasure. \" Mr. David Elphinstone, Miss Jeanie Erskine and I mean to honour you with an early call at your chambers before court hours to-morrow morning.\" \"I shall be highly honoured, Lady Marget, and"], [131, "THE SUPPER IN BLAIR'S CLOSE. 127 I'll wait your pleasure as long as my duty to my seniors and my client will permit,\" answered the advocate, promptly, making his best low bow, and refraining from betraying the slightest sur prise. \" Lady Marget ! \" protested Jeanie with a gasp. Then Lady Marget could no longer control herself. \"Jeanie Erskine, you're a bonnie ane to find fault with anything I propose, after to-night.\" \"Oh! have I done wrong?\" cried the conscience stricken Jeanie. \" Madam,\" broke in the other offender, resent fully, \" I have yet to learn what right you have to blame Miss Erskine \u2014 or anybody.\" \" I'm blaming nobody ; you'll drive me mad between you. Jeanie, if it is your father you're feared for, you ken you've only to tell him what is the truth, that you went with me on my business, and he'll be satisfied. You know I'm as my own mistress where my family are concerned. They are too well acquainted with me to call in question what I do. I'll bid my cousin, Mrs. Hugh, lend us her countenance, if that will please you, so that there will be no room for fault-finding. Mr. Elphinstone, will seven o'clock be too early for you ?

I'm at your and my client's disposal at any hour of the twenty-four,\" declared Davie Elphinstone, lifting his three-cornered hat."], [133, "CHAPTER VII. A VISIT TO DAVIE ELPHINSTONE'S CHAMBERS. What Lady Marget had said was the literal truth. Mr. Simon Erskine was so thoroughly convinced of the excellent balance of his daughter Jeanie's mind and conscience, that he would have freely trusted her in still more debatable situa- tions than in that of making an early morning call in Lady Marget Elliot's company, on Lady Marget's business, or at least on the business of her acknowledged suitor, at the chambers of Mr. David Elphinstone, or at those of any other bachelor advocate in the faculty. Supposing Mr. Simon had heard of what an enemy might have called \" the exhibition \" at Mrs. Cockburn's the previous evening, his faith would still have re- mained unshaken. He would have treated the matter as a momentary ebullition of youthful folly, which might be the more easily condoned in that it was not likely to be repeated. Mrs. Hugh Elliot was a widowed cousin I"], [134, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 130 belonging to, and in a measure dependent on, the Teviotdale family. She could be appealed to for aid on any occasion without much risk of refusal. The risk was further minimised when the petitioner was Lady Marget, who was Mrs. Hugh's best friend and most liberal benefactress. Mrs. Hugh was a worthy enough woman of subdued spirit, colourless character, and uncertain age. Her very appearance was individually flavourless and undecided, since mixed up with her carefully preserved weeds were sundry articles of attire in the form of satin and lace (muff of satin and lace ne'glig^e), which had belonged, in the first place, to the Countess and Lady Marget, who were neither of them widows. As they had bestowed the gifts on their relative, she felt bound to wear them as a mark of her appreciation of the commercial value of the gifts and in her anxiety not to slight the donors. Lady Marget and Jeanie were going on an expedition, in connection with which they were desirous of attracting as little notice as possible. The early morning was not sufficient protection. They muffled their faces and figures in the tartan plaids or \" screens \" which, like the dominos worn at the London masqued balls, were still in use for women of all classes, when privacy was wanted."], [135, "A VISIT TO DAVIE ELPHINSTONE. 131 In the independent, frolicsome society of old Edinburgh, lively adventures \u2014 of which innocent privacy was a necessary accompaniment \u2014 were not unsought even by the most virtuous and honour able of her matrons and maidens. Apart from affording a disguise, the screens were already largely given over to decent servant lasses, like Eppie Caw, or respectable young wives of the working class, like Nanzie Boyd. In spite of Allan Ramsay's word in its favour the screen was doomed. Yet Allan was right in this, as in other articles of his creed. The plaid of fine woollen, or of silken material, when worn by women of degree, fell in soft or rich folds from head to foot, in a manner singularly becoming to its wearer, while affording a distracting bait to the curiosity of the baffled gazer. Advocate Elphinstone's chambers were up three long flights of unsavoury stairs, in an entry which dived abruptly out of the High Street. Their great recommendation was that they were near the lawyers' seat of war \u2014 the Parliament House. So highly was this advantage prized, that not a few of the writers of all ranks had their offices, and even their dwelling-houses, in the flats above the shops, which distinguished the High from the Laigh Luckenbooths, at the very"], [136, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 132 lug of the law, as the tenants flattered themselves. The ladies' visit had been prepared for by such means as were at Davie Elphinstone's command. The passages had been swept out. His chambers, or rather his couple of closets crammed with books and papers, had undergone such a per functory \" redding up \" as a man's unskilled hand could accomplish. The remains of his breakfast had been cleared away, while as yet the fish wives and water-caddies had scarcely begun their rounds, and chairs had been borrowed to accom modate the visitors. In spite of these attempts at improvement, the \" den \" would have been incredibly dingy, cumbered, and devoid of any touch of adornment beyond the bits of gilliflower in the jug on the mantel-piece, but for the glamour in Jeanie's eyes. It made her look round her with pride and admiration, and compare, the inner book closet where Davie's clerk was usually niched, to the study of a learned divine. She noticed, too, that the owner of the chambers had found her a chair opposite his own \u2014 a chair by the tireless hearth \u2014 which still had a certain air as if it might have been the mistress's seat, had the premises pos sessed a mistress. Mrs. Hugh Elliot was sworn to secrecy, and"], [137, "A VISIT TO DAVIE ELPHINSTONE. 133 might be depended upon not to let her voice be heard on the housetops, in a matter of vital im portance to the house of Teviotdale. Davie Elphinstone's clerk had been sent out of the way lest his ears might be tickled by a stray word. Elphinstone listened with grave attention while Lady Marget repeated to him, with a method and clearness which had something stern in them, the story which Jeanie had told her disjointedly. He wrote down briefly the substance of what he heard, with the address of Nanzie Boyd's sister Jenny, which Jeanie was able to supply. He also asked a question or two as to the precise date of the Frenchwoman's arrival, her age and appearance, which neither Lady Marget nor Jeanie could answer. \" Never mind, we'll soon find out,\" he said encouragingly, in the middle of his professional reserve ; adding, \" you were quite right to put us on the track. We are greatly indebted to you, Lady Marget.\" But he gave no opinion on the truth or the falsehood of the tale. Jeanie was instantly cast down ; even Lady Marget was staggered. \" I thought at once, when I heard the story,\" Lady Marget said, with a falter in her voice, while her calm bearing failed her for a moment,"], [138, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 134 and she spoke with some vehemence, \" that it was a wicked fabrication \u2014 the crafty machination of the agents of Mr. Andrew Douglas, whom he is too honest to suspect and too canny to control. They began by sticking at no villainy in frightening and subduing the French witnesses, and now, for their own credit, these knavish agents are seeking to bolster up their lies by fresh lies of a deeper dye.\" \" It may be so. I trust it is so,\" he answered, with no coldness, but with forensic caution, checking his hot temper. \" It must be so,\" corrected Lady Marget, with an involuntary stamp of her foot. \" Oh, it must be so ! \" cried Jeanie, clasping her hands imploringly. \"There is no 'must' in a court of justice,\" he replied, shaking his big head, and looking at the last speaker with smiling, indulgent rebuke. \" I have already said,\" continued Lady Marget, with a dash of haughtiness in her manner, \"that it would not consort with the honour of a gentle man like Mr. John Douglas to have the tale hushed up, instead of sifted to the bottom. However the case may go, the mere whisper of such a claim \u2014 uninvestigated and stifled in the birth \u2014 would be a stain on his reputation that"], [139, "A VISIT TO DAVIE ELPHINSTONE. 135 would cling to him, and his whole race after him, to the end of their days.\" \" I agree with you there,\" he said decidedly ; \" the defender would never have an hour's peace with such a sword of Damocles hanging over him and his.

It sounds as if it were founded on the earlier criminal charge of the kidnapped French children \u2014 if so be there were kidnapped children ; beyond that I never heard a word of it ; but that is no proof either way. The statement would have been pretty certain to get to the enemy's know ledge. It would have been a fine nick in our neck, and a capital point against us for them to have taken us by surprise, by trumping up the story, and implying that we had kept it in the dark. Now, Lady Marget, we'll steal a march on them, and make stock of the fable, if possible,\" cried Davie Elphinstone, beginning to be gleeful in anticipation of brandishing it in the pursuer's face, and tearing it to tatters in the hearing of the judges. \"It behoves counsel, if they are wise, to be open and above-board when it is in their power.\" \" But we are every one of us bound to be open and above-board always and everywhere,\" put in"], [140, "136 LADY JEAN'S SON. the bewildered Jeanie. She could not understand Lady Marget's talk of its not consorting with Mr. John Douglas's honour to fail to clear up the fresh mystery, nor could she follow Davie Elphinstone's speech of the bad policy and injury involved in letting the pursuer's counsel proclaim the new claim first, and thus throw upon their adversaries the odium of having slurred it over or suppressed it. To Jeanie there was only one question \u2014 that of right or wrong, truth or falsehood. The French woman was either an arrant impostor or she was the real mother of Mr. John Douglas (which God forbid !). If she was the first, she ought to be punished. If she was the last \u2014 ah me ! to think of her, a stranger in a strange land, a bereft, well nigh distraught mother, who has wandered many a mile over land and sea, amidst boundless perils and hardships innumerable, to identify a long-lost son. All the highest, nay, even the lowest feel ings of human nature; all \"the weeping blood in woman's breast\" called, in accents which would not be denied, to have her evidence believed and sustained, and the poor soul's unutterable yearning satisfied at any sacrifice, however costly. It was just the right or the wrong of the story which a clever, upright chield like Davie Elphinstone should be able to fathom."], [141, "A VISIT TO DAVIE ELPHINSTONE. 137 He answered in his own defence her unspoken protest, being impelled to speak without ceremony, but not without loving exasperation. \"Jeanie Erskine, it is not my business, let us be thankful, to decipher right from wrong. What I have to do, and it needs all the wisdom of greater men than I can ever pretend to be to do it, is to interpret the law of Scotland and the Acts of Parliament, and take heed that my clients have the benefit of them. It is not even for me and Mr. John Douglas's other counsel to prove that he is the lawful heir of the Duke of Douglas through his mother, Lady Jean, as she and her husband Sir John have asserted. It is for the other side, the pursuer's counsel, to show convincing proof to the contrary. Questions of morality are out of our scope.\" Jeanie did not see it, and could not be made to see it, even though it was Davie Elphinstone who was the interpreter. For her, law and lawyers existed solely to vindicate the right and discomfit the wrong."], [142, "CHAPTER VIII. MOTHER AND SON. It was arranged that John Douglas, by his own consent unhesitatingly given, should confront the woman who asserted that she would find in him her abducted son, and that he should be accom panied on his errand by Davie Elphinstone. The advocate might be supposed to tell what the law would have to say to natural instincts and alleged tokens of birth-marks and moles, which had sur vived the growth of a child from infancy to manhood. In the course of the lawyer's whole experience, which was destined to be long and wide, Davie Elphinstone was wont to declare in confidence that he never witnessed so strange a scene as that in which he assisted at the house in the Cowgate, in which there were rooms occupied by Jenny Burnet, the wife of the drunken caddie, her progeny, and her lodger. Elphinstone was baffled to begin with, in spite"], [143, "MOTHER AND SON. 139 of his natural acuteness, his pondering interest in his fellow -men, and that lively curiosity with regard to the labyrinths of their affairs, which helped his retentive memory and sound logic. He could not read Douglas's mind prior to the meeting, or ascertain its attitude with regard to this strange woman of the French gutters, who vehemently affirmed that she was his mother. Had Jock Douglas any doubt on the subject ? He was not more than five years of age when his mother died, and in the autumn of the following year his brother died also. It is possible to remember a good many domestic passages and maternal endearments at five, but by the time the child has attained his majority these remembrances are apt to get a little vague and confused. The blurring process must be immensely increased by a rapid trans ference of the small receiver of the impressions from one country to another, and from a state of comparative comfort or reckless extravagance to the opposite conditions of pinching poverty. The tendency to forgetfulness is intensified by the transplanting of the little lad from one household to another. First it was to Euphie Montgomerie's, then to Douglas Castle, then to Lady Schaw's, and then to Murthly, when Sir John came into his brother's estate, and so was able to claim his boy."], [144, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 140 At last it was back with a flourish of trumpets to the grand gates of Douglas Castle, which had been closed against him when he stood before them with his mother and twin brother. Again they were thrown wide to the young heir, who was hugged by the boisterous Duchess and had his hand shaken by the stupid, sulky Duke. What could have been the result of all these meta morphoses save chaos in the brain of the young man who had experienced them ? True, his father, Sir John, was still alive, and solemnly deposed to the fact that John Douglas was his elder son, the one surviving child of his second wife, Lady Jean. But poor Sir John had been a harum-scarum, polished ne'er-do-well in his high days, and in his worst was so be-muddled by age, infirmity, and the consequences of a long life of well-bred dissipation, that it was impossible to attach much weight to his testimony. As for John Douglas's elder brother, Charles, who would succeed to Murthly, he had been brought up by his mother's kindred. He had no personal acquaintance with the particulars of his reputed half-brother's birth and childhood. He civilly and prudently professed his belief in the relationship, and naturally trusted that John Douglas might retain the great estates of the"], [145, "MOTHER AND SON. 141 late Duke, but in view of the circumstance that the young men had grown up comparative strangers to each other, nothing farther could be expected from Charles Drummond. There was a theory in the mouths, and on the pens of Mr. Andrew Douglas's supporters. It was that the undoubted affection which Sir John and Lady Jean had shown their twin children was not altogether a pretence of regard, got up to bear out their story. It was alleged that the extraordinary pair of conspirators had, especially in the case of Lady Jean, actually conceived a strong personal attachment to the little boys whom the fine lady and gentleman had summarily adopted. This theory of necessity included the implication that the supposed father and mother had never, in their most unguarded moments, and in their utmost difficulties, treated the twin brothers, in word and deed, otherwise than with the pride and fondness which might have been looked for from elderly people towards the children born to them late in life. It was possible that John Douglas might, in the tantalising dimness and confusion of his recollections, be driven to ask himself if his opponents' theory was, after all, the explanation of the tender kisses showered upon him and his"], [146, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 142 brother by Lady Jean, of the rides on foot and shoulder provided for the children by Sir John, even when rheumatism was making the primitive exercise so agreeable to them, a torture to him. Was he, John Douglas, after all not the son of the high-born, spendthrift, impecunious couple from whom he had been led to believe he derived his being ? Had they not been unfor tunate simpletons, but cheats and liars capable of the deepest deceit, the most unscrupulous fraud ? The Duke of Douglas, his nephew had always been told, had displayed his disapproval of his sister Lady Jean's ill-starred private marriage by churlishly withdrawing from her the allowance which was the only means of sub sistence she and her husband possessed. Had they, in return, sought to revenge themselves, and at the same time make a cunning provision for the future, by bringing forward the spurious twin boys, whom the husband and wife plotted to pass off as their children and his Grace's nephews \u2014 one of them the lawful heir to the ducal estates? And was it also credible that in the very act of practising the infamous imposition, the natures of the man and woman, so far from being farther demoralised by their baseness, were won by the little children whom they were"], [147, "MOTHER AND SON. 143 using as tools, until each profession of regard grew genuine, instead of fictitious? What ques tions were these to rack an unhappy young man's brain ? There was one person and one alone who might have done something to answer the ques tions. This was old \" Nursie,\" the faithful de voted woman whom John Douglas could re member from the first dawn of consciousness, and to whom he was disposed to turn as the only sure foothold and stay, in the quaking bog of misty recollections and maddening contra dictions. \" Nursie \" had not only been Lady Jean's maid from her motherless youth upwards, and the confidante and accomplice in the run away match at a time of life, when both mistress and maid might have learnt more discretion, she had also been the children's sole nurse in the scrambling days in London. She had come down with them and their mother to Scotland ; and when Lady Jean had gone back to be near her good-for-nothing husband \u2014 whom she loved, and who loved her in his easy fashion to the last \u2014 when he was detained in the King's Bench, the little boys were left behind in Edinburgh with the trusty retainer. Their mother died in her arms, so did little Sholto ; and it was by"], [148, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 144 \"Nursie,\" when the Duke took his last \"strum\" and Jock was sent back to his humble ally, that she, who could do no more for him, solemnly consigned the boy to the charitable protection of one of the ladies of quality who had remained faithful to old ties of friendship, and this lady kept the child till his father was at liberty and could claim him. But the ill-fortune which had dogged \" Nursie's \" em- ployers, attended them in connection with her also. The woman whom her nurseling remem- bered as still hale and in possession of all her faculties, was now in extreme old age, in her dotage, lying on her death-bed. True, she had already made a deposition while still fit for the task, largely confirming Sir John's statement ; but by reason of her scanty education and fail- ing memory, she had fallen into sundry natural and easily-understood errors with regard to dates and places. The simplicity of those mistakes had not kept them from being eagerly caught at by the opposite side in the suit, and brought forward as so many damning proofs of her un trustworthiness, and of her complicity with her former master and mistress in the fraud which they had sought to perpetrate. There was something inscrutable about young"], [149, "MOTHER AND SON. 145 Johri Douglas, transparent as his character looked at the first glance. Fine - looking, high-bred, courteous and considerate to all, with a good forehead, a sensitive mouth, but a strong chin, it was impossible to read between the lines, and tell either his thoughts or his feelings. He had learnt perfectly, in a hard school, lessons with regard to which Sir John and Lady Jean had never acquired so much as the ABC. Sir John's ranting and bragging, Lady Jean's babbling, were propensities far removed from the habitually silent self-restraint of their son. If there was anything lacking in the role of popular hero, which he played with so much grace and dignity, it was the positive in capacity to let himself go, the absolute self possession which ruled his speech, and appeared, not in his words alone, but in every look. Davie Elphinstone had never seen the reserve and composure, singular in so young a man, which were marked features in John Douglas's individuality, more conspicuously displayed than during this visit of the two men to the Cow gate ; a visit which might mean much to both. For any sign of excitement or agitation which Douglas betrayed, the occurrence might have been of the most ordinary description \u2014 a good natured saunter to inquire after an old retainer, K"], [150, "146 LADY JEAN'S SON. or an errand of charity to the poor and needy. The chief figure in the scene was looked at, recognized, pointed at, whispered about. He even stood a chance of being followed as the central object of the entire gossip \u2014 high and low, of Edinburgh or Scotland, for that month of July. But he appeared to take it as a tribute to his rank and misfortunes, and to bear it with enviable non chalance. He returned with punctiliousness and friendliness the respectful greetings paid to him, occasionally, by the passers-by \u2014 mostly trades people and working-men and women, for the hour was as early as that at which Lady Marget and Jeanie Erskine, with Mrs. Hugh Elliot to play pro priety, had visited Davie Elphinstone's chambers the day before. But the saluted man seemed to attach no importance to the salutations. He did not refer to the purpose which had carried him and his companion abroad betimes. If Douglas let fall a word, it was such as any disengaged pedestrian might have dropped \u2014 of the hindrance to traffic caused by the slovenly, encumbered state of the streets ; or it was a question as to who occupied this house or that, whether Lady Tor pichen had left her winter lodgings, or if any of the Lord Chief Justice's family had already started for his country-houses"], [151, "MOTHER AND SON. 147 One of the finest burgher houses in Edinburgh was passed ; then there were more high \" gusset \" houses down an archway ; more outer stairs and draw-wells, with a gem of an ancient church in the near distance. Finally, there was a dive down a perilous, broken flight of stairs to a \" laigh \" abode, that of Nanzie Boyd's sister Jenny, her husband the caddie, her burden of bairns, and her doubtful foreign lodger. The caddie and the bairns were already dis- persed on their business or play ; there were only two figures discernible in the house-room. It was a poor little smoke-begrimed place, in which could be dimly distinguished the discoloured deal-table for all uses, the family box-bed, the spinning wheel with its attendant reel. There were a couple of deal chairs and an array of \" creepies \" or three- legged wooden stools. The pair of water stoups stood behind the door ; the aumrie hung by the small window \u2014 half of it below the level of the street, its small panes filled with thick greenish glass. The iron fore-face with the whitewashed \"cheeks\" or jambs \u2014 the brightest point in the room \u2014 represented a grate and held a peat fire, burning with the customary dull red glow ; on it rested a flat iron girdle, while on either side, balancing each other, stood the kail pot and the"], [152, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 148 porridge pot, a greasy ladle in the one, a porridge encrusted thivel in the other. The mistress of the room, a careworn, hard working, yet still comely and hearty wife, stood with the sleeves of her short gown rolled up to her elbows, her hands and arms dabbled with oat meal, in the act of \"putting out\" an oat cake at the table. And as a necessary ceremony pre paratory to laying it on the girdle, she was in denting it round the edge, in a free-hand pattern, executed with her thumb nail. The other figure was more unhomely and bizarre. It was that of a little woman with a brown face and a bent back, bony arms and clawy hands. She had skin like parchment, small glittering eyes, a mouth fallen in from lack of teeth, which added to the nut-cracker effect of her long nose and sharp-pointed chin. She sat in the darkest corner of the dark little room, crouched on a settle, at one side of the hearth. She was hanging over the fire, though the atmosphere was stifling, as if she sought all the artificial heat she could get, to drive out the chill from her scantily flowing blood and her dry and rattling bones. She wore a tight grey jitpe and a white flannel camisole with sleeves, of an outlandish cut, and not over clean. Above it she had a grass-green apron, with a bib pinned"], [153, "MOTHER AND SON. 149 across her flat chest to her lean shoulders. On her head was one of the linen cowls, without borders, which served as children's sleeping caps in those days. It formed a strong, and in some aspects, a ludicrous contrast to the stereotyped Scotch mutch, voluminous, whether its wearers were of high or low degree. The cowl was drawn far over the wrinkled forehead, so that only a few elf-locks of grizzled hair escaped at the sides and hung down on the neck of the flannel jacket. When the woman rose, it was seen that her feet, instead of being bare like Jenny's, were clad in coarse woollen stockings and wooden sabots, which clanked on the flagged floor. The poor creature was not in rags : she had patrons and patronesses in her village. There were the intendant of Mon sieur, at the Chateau ; the aubergiste Maitre Louis, who had a vineyard and a farm ; La Griponne, whose poultry fetched a premium in the Paris Halles. These compatriots and compatriotes had taken care that their protegee should present herself at the scene of action, in what they viewed as decent guise. For, by a supreme and combined effort, made under the influence of the lively interest which the great lawsuit, with its appeal to the Tournelle, together with the memorial of the Archbishop of Paris, was arousing throughout"], [154, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 150 France, the local magnates had exerted themselves to procure for their half-crazy countrywoman the desire of her heart. They had furthered, with their hoarded francs, her journey to Dieppe, her voyage thence to the pier of Leith, her progress to Edin burgh. These friends had been fired throughout by the expectation that her empassioned words would clear up the mystery, when her fellow-villagers would get their full share of the credit of the revelation. La veuve Dobrte's garb was not that of a vagabond, it was simply that of a French peasant of the humblest class, such as she professed to be. Elphinstone had given an intimation of his visit in company with Mr. John Douglas, but he thought it necessary to add to his general \"good day to you \" a special explanation in his laboured French to \"the French witch\" by the fire. \"Madame,\" he said (if she had been Scotch he would have addressed her as \" Luckie \"), \" I have been as good as my word ; I have brought to you the Scotch gentleman you were desirous to see, though I have warned you beforehand he is a very different person from what you take him to be. You have great call to thank such as he for coming out of his way, in his throng of engage ments, just to humour an old wife and set her mind at rest.\" The woman to whom he spoke"], [155, "MOTHER AND SON. 151 gave a shrill cry, and sprang up with a quickness and lightness marvellous in the shrunken, trembling limbs. Jenny, in her character of hostess, was hastily wiping the two chairs with her \" brat,\" and inviting the gentlemen \" in by,\" in evident satisfaction at the honour of their presence. She stopped short with a hasty \"Guid guide us!\" and stood still, with her back to her table and her baking, pre pared to stare round-eyed at the next act in the performance. Madame made her way towards Douglas with surprising swiftness, flung herself upon him, grip ping his two wrists, and stretching up on tiptoe to peer into his face. \" Oh, ciel ! \" she cried in her native tongue, with a mumbling articulation, to which a species of frenzy lent a certain amount of clearness, \" the moment of fate has come. The good God has sent it at last. Jacques, Jacques, mon enfant, mon petit Jacques ! is it that I see thee again when thou hast grown tin beau garcon, un gentilhomme ? Is it that I touch thee once more, as my brain has been on fire to do all these years? But though thou art the finest of gentlemen, thou wilt not deny thy poor mother who bore thee in sorrow and trouble \u2014 never, never ! \""], [156, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 152 There was no cheat here ; she might be mad, but she was in earnest. \" Guid preserve us ! \" protested Jenny Burnet again, having appropriated the part of chorus. \" I dinna ken a word the demented body says, but I'm a mither mysel' ; I suld ken a mither's voice. Keep us a' ! Maister Elphinstone, this will be a bonnie piece o' wark. I wad gie a sillar penny, though I can ill spare't, that she had never crossed my door stane.\" Elphinstone did not hear her. He was watching breathlessly the mixture of patience and pity, the unconcern, save for the unhappy woman, with which the son thus confidently claimed, endured the searching scrutiny. \" Good heavens ! \" Davie was saying to himself, \" if I were he, and there was the faintest shadow of a doubt, I had sooner be shot than meet these burning eyes in which all the tears were dried up twenty years ago.\" In the mean time Douglas was replying gently in better French than Elphinstone's. \" Madame, I am sorry to disappoint you, but my name is not Jacques, it is John \u2014 John Douglas. But you are right in this ; if I could recall having but once seen you before, I should not decline the acquaintance.\""], [157, "MOTHER AND SON. 153 He could afford to be cool, while there rose up before him in violent contrast a vision of Lady Jean. She had been a tall, elegant woman, with fair hair and fair skin, and a pretty pink colour which she retained to the end. She had worn fine clothes \u2014 however tumbled and shabby her \"lace head\" and her quilted and embroidered robe de chambre, however worn her high-heeled satin slippers. She had insisted on being properly dressed the very day she died. Her manner, in its utmost affability and greatest silliness, was unconsciously that of a born aristocrat. \"Peste!\" the old Frenchwoman was crying, with a piteous grin which exposed her toothless gums. \" How couldst thou remember having seen me, if thou wert not told of it afterwards ? Thou wert my poupte, my cabbage in thy berqeau, when thy cruel father was tempted and fell. For he stole and sold thee that day I had gone up to the Chateau with the wool I had spun. But do not curse thy father, mon Jacques, since I have cursed him for thee, and he has gone to face his Judge who will settle all for us, Monsieur le Cure says. The glass-blowing trade was bad, and there was such a number of us then \u2014 Pierre Michel and Antoine, Suzette and Nanette. Even the fields which my man had from his father were burdened"], [158, "154 LADY JEAN'S SON. beyond bearing, what with the gabelle and the road-tax and the seed-corn. Ma foi! the times were hard. He thought thou wert born to misery like his own, and the traitor who tempted him promised thou shouldst be softly lodged and well cared for all thy days.\" \"Yes, I understand,\" said Douglas, still with commendable quietness, \" but it was not of me they spoke. I was not that little child whom I grieve to hear you lost. My father is alive. He is a Scotch gentleman, he was never a glass-blower in Moulin-sur-Aube, that village near Paris from which I understand you come.\" He could have laughed in spite of his self-command, as another vision swept across his mental horizon, not of Lady Jean this time, but of a big stately man in a \"cinnamon coloured coat with gold buttons,\" ruffling and lording it even in the King's Bench, fain to feast his fellow-prisoners out of the stores which Lady Jean spent her time in procuring for him. \" Tiens ! that is their story,\" cried the old woman, angrily. \" Thou art not going to take their word for it instead of thy mother's, my son ? They said they would make thee a fine gentleman, and they have done it. Oh ! I know I am asking thee to give up much ; I am a beast with selfishness, but"], [159, "MOTHER AND SON. 155 I am alone, all alone ; my heart is empty, and it has such pangs of child-hunger ; then my head swims, and the neighbours say old Bettine is beside herself. Pierre has gone long ago to the wars ; Michel slipped his foot and fell into the furnace ; Antoine was taken with the fever ; Suzette is married on the other side of Paris and has her hands full ; and my little Nanette, so gentille, like a bird, she went away one day to see the gay shops and the busy streets of Paris \u2014 what wilt thou ? Dost thou wish to hear anything farther ? \" she appealed to him fiercely ; \" she never returned to her wretched mother, who had trusted her.\" \" Poor mother ! \" said John Douglas, softly, \" I have known a son without a mother, though I do not know the mother without son or daughter, which you tell me you are. I pity you, but I am afraid I cannot serve you, for I have never heard of those whom you mourn. Believe me, I am a stranger to you.\" \" No, no, a thousand times no ! \" she cried wildly. \"Thou wilt not disown thy mother and bring God's vengeance on thy head. Thou wilt own her just once, and carry her away from this miserable cold grey Scotland, where she is chilled to the marrow of her bones, starved and poisoned"], [160, "156 LADY JEAN'S SON. for want of food that a Christian woman can eat. Ous! not a single tartine, not a morsel of Neuf chdtel cheese, not an omelette, or drop of Medoc, to refresh a fainting woman. Jacques, thou wilt take me back to our France, our village, and let me have one day of pride in my life, to make up for all its sorrows and losses ? Thou wilt suffer me to show thee to my friends \u2014 my good, well to-do friends who listened to my tale at last, and to what my old gossip Toinette and Jeanneton said they remembered of my poupfe's being carried away, and of how I went out of my wits ? Do that for me, mon cher, mon ange, and I will ask no more. I will let thee go back to thy friends in this dismal Huguenot Scotland. I will be content to have seen thee once again.\" \" Set her up ! \" broke in Jenny, unable to restrain herself any longer. \" Let her gang back to her Papish France and welcome. I hae let her sit in the ingle neuk from morning to nicht ; I hae gien her a gude caff bed, but the hoose ; I hae fed her wi' halesome parritch and kail, for whilk I'll never be half paid, and here's she, the neist thing to cockin' her neive at me \u2014 the auld besom !

She's but a poor old demented foreigner who kens no better.\" \" Alas ! madame, I cannot fulfil your request,\" Douglas's melodious voice was heard representing, with unabated long-suffering and inexhaustible courtesy. \" I am not your lost son, as your good friends would soon discover. I have my own urgent affairs to attend to here ; they would not permit me to be any woman's escort abroad, how ever sorry I might be for her.\" \" But I will show thee that thou art none other than my Jacques,\" persisted Madame, trembling with eagerness, \" and then thou wilt not refuse thy mother her one prayer.\" She stretched up her wrinkled brown hand, with its talon-like nails, and clutched at his cravat, dragging it down and leaving his throat bare. \"There was a tache \u2014 a darling little brown tache ! I have kissed it many a time \u2014 below thy chin. Ah, here it is. Below thy chin, did I say ? No, below thy left ear. Thy poor old mother's memory is failing her every day. Now thy right arm. Quick ! quick ! \" she cried, in a voice of triumphant expectation. \" Strip it ! hold it out here for this femme sauvage, this gentleman to see for themselves, whether thy old mother speaks true or not. There is a long red"], [162, "158 LADY JEAN'S SON. tclaboussure, as of three cherries spilt on the bend of thy arm. Hein ! you will see, you all, that none save my Jacques can bear the token of which I tell you beforehand.\" Mechanically John Douglas did as she bade him : tore open the diamond button, pulled aside the lace ruffle, rolled up the velvet sleeve of his coat, and exposed a muscular arm, without spot or blemish of any kind. \" Bah ! thou art deceiving me,\" screamed the old woman, \" or my memory is playing me devil's tricks, as with the tache under the chin. It must have been the left arm, not the right \u2014 oui, oui, that is it.\" He uncovered the other arm and showed it without flaw or mark. She fell back with a groan as from a broken heart. She made a gesture as if to push Douglas away, and covered her face with her hands. \"Miserable!\" she moaned; \"I have been de ceived ; thou art not he \u2014 I have not found my son. What will become of me, miserable that I am ?.\" That spectre was laid for ever. If it survived at all, it was in order that it might be proudly hurled at the enemy, as a signal proof of how honestly the defender and his agents went to work ; how fearlessly Mr. John Douglas was ready"], [163, "MOTHER AND SON. 159 to confront every questioner of his rights. His purse was in his hand, and he was proceeding to drop it into the lap of the unhappy creature, suddenly plunged from the heights of joyful fruition to the black depths of failure and despair. \" Take this, ma fetntne\" his kind voice was saying compassionately ; \" it will at least pay your passage home ; and it may help you to search elsewhere and find your Jacques.\" Elphinstone attempted to stay his hand. \"Hooly! hooly! Mr. Douglas,\" murmured Davie, driven into the broadest vernacular in his alarm, as he caught his companion by the arm and arrested him in the deed. \" Sir, sir, take tent what you're about ! Think how the gift may get wind, and what mistaken construction of bribery and corruption may be put upon it.\" \" What care I ? \" cried John Douglas, for once yielding to youthful impetuosity, freeing his arm, and flinging his gift to the cowering old woman. \" Good Lord ! am I not to be at liberty to solace the misery of a deluded, bereaved wretch, whom I have been compelled to undeceive, lest the world should say I'm suborning her for my own purposes? A galley-slave would not be so gagged and bound. Perish the thought, Elphin stone ! \""], [164, "160 LADY JEAN'S SON. \"Ay,\" said Jenny, planting her arms akimbo, and looking with frank admiration at the speaker. \" Hear and see till the heich magnanimous speerit and the open hand of the rale gentleman ! What need you mint at ither birth-marks ? that is ane that canna fail.\""], [165, "CHAPTER IX. THE VERDICT. Sinister rumours were afloat \u2014 the decision of the judges was likely to go against Mr. John Douglas. Not merely rumours, treasonable threats were fill- ing the summer air and rendering it murky and lurid. The month's trial was drawing to a close, and the tension of suspense was driving men mad ; not only did it affect the pursuer and the defender, Mr. Andrew and Mr. John Douglas, its malignant influence spread far and wide. In point of fact the principals, who might well have been worked up to the last pitch of excitement, still hid their moods under a veil of decent forbearance and composure, like well-bred, sensible men. It was their unscrupulous, irresponsible adherents who raged and swore vengeance against the hostile judges. The frantic efforts to coerce and over- awe justice, reached their climax in the two anonymous letters received by the Lord President, and courageously and solemnly laid by him before L"], [166, "162 LADY JEAN'S SON. the Court of Session. In one letter the writer bound himself to \"burn the President's lodgings,\" both in town and at his country seat of Arniston, and farther pledged himself that there was another \"Porteous mob\" in preparation, with three hundred men banded together to make of Dundas another Captain Porteous. In the second letter the writer vowed that he himself would undertake to blow out the Presi dent's brains, the first time he was met abroad, if he did not give his vote for Mr. John Douglas. The insulted majesty of the law protested against this shameful violation of its sanctity, in a scheme to intimidate its chief official. It was supported by all the powers of Government and the force of public opinion in the classes which have the highest respect for peace and order, as maintained by the country's most honoured institution. The two litigants gravely disclaimed all connection with the ruffian-like scandal. The King and the Government offered a reward of five hundred pounds, for the discovery and conviction of the writer or writers of these insolent and treasonable documents. The Provost and magistrates followed suit, with an offer of two hundred pounds ; the Society of the writers to the Signet, bound to back their brethren on a higher rung of the"], [167, "THE VERDICT. 163 professional ladder, three hundred ; Mr. Andrew and Mr. John Douglas, three hundred each, though the loser in the suit would be ill able to afford the testimony that his hands were clean from the guilt of any reckless endeavour to weigh down the scales of justice. Scotland was then a poor country. It had not by any means recovered commercially from the first disastrous effects of the union, which imposed upon the nation the English malt tax and the salt tax, thus ruining utterly two of its chief industries, while it took from the capital its court and parliament. The reward was a large temptation to dangle before discontented and covetous eyes. But no clue was ever found to the perpetrators of these fierce, seditious letters. It had leaked out that the judges were divided in their opinions, and that in spite of the loyalty and enthusiasm of the huge body of John Douglas's supporters in all classes, in spite of the wisdom of his senior counsel, and of the fervid eloquence and superhuman exertions of such a junior as Advocate Davie Elphinstone, the preponderating votes were likely to be in favour of the unromantic though estimable Mr. Andrew Douglas. Still, the contest was so close that a vote or two might turn it either way. Some of the fifteen judges"], [168, "164 LADY JEAN'S SON. either could not make up their minds, or were \" close \" in another sense, and chose to keep the conclusion they had arrived at a mystery to the last moment. Thus the ferment in the public mind increased, and the protracted anxiety of the long trial was strained to the point of torture. On the day at the end of July on which the verdict was to be given, all Scotland was quiver ing with expectation ; all Edinburgh that was not doomed to work off its excitement in first doing its day's darg of labour, was up with the dawn to secure good places in the Parliament Close, if not in the House itself, so as to be early acquainted with the result. \"You will not fail me, Jeanie,\" said Lady Marget, drawing a long sighing breath, which would have been a sob if it had not been for her proud spirit and strong will. The occasion on which she spoke was when she looked in at the Erskines' house on the evening before the last day of the trial. \" We will see the last of the business and of them \u2014 at least, I shall. But if I were you, no exacting care of a father, or of a pack of tyrannous young brothers and sisters, would rob me of my love and spoil my life.\" \"And if I were you, Lady Marget \" said Jeanie, moved to make a retort. But she stopped"], [169, "THE VERDICT. 165 short after the first words. She was not sensible that her silence was more expressive than any speech would have been, but she could only gaze sympathetically at her friend with the sweet, woe begone hazel eyes which had shed many a tear in secret within the last ten days. Lady Marget had lost much of her fine colour, had lost flesh, too, under the severity of the ordeal. If it had lasted much longer, she declared, with curious self-disdain, she would have been reduced to a whipping-post, with the complexion of a whey cheese, not worth any man's taking or leaving. \" If you were me,\" she repeated after Jeanie, \"you would forget that you were a Teviotdale Elliot, and that he was declared to be the son of a French beggar \u2014 a thief who stole and sold his own flesh and bluid. If he had been caught in the act, he would have paid for it with his felon life, or else he would have been branded on the back and sent to the galleys, hooted at by the lowest of the rabble from which he sprang. Is that all you understand of fitness and pro priety ? \" \" But you do not believe it \u2014 not one word of it ? \" protested Jeanie, with a gasp. \" What does it signify what I believe ? \" said"], [170, "166 LADY JEAN'S SON. Lady Marget, with scornful bitterness. \" It is what the judges decide, and the law awards, that makes or mars the man. Poor Jock knows better than to ask such a sacrifice from me or any woman. Well, I suppose we all know our own troubles best. But you'll go with me, Jeanie ? We need not stick ourselves up where we'll be kenspeckle, where folk would be watching us and speculating when we were going to faint. I am not of the fainting kind, neither are you, for you've been too busy taking care of other folk to have had time for cultivating dwams. We'll leave that to her Grace of Queensberry. I'll send Mungie to secure us places in a back row, and we'll creep in and nobody be any the wiser.\" \" And they'll not be troubled with our presence,\" said Jeanie, in a low, tremulous voice. \" If we cannot make it up to them, we'll not vex them with the knowledge that we are seeing them beaten.\" \"As if they would believe that we could stay away ! \" exclaimed Lady Marget, incredulously. \"Fortune may take a turn,\" said Jeanie, with wistful deprecation. Lady Marget shook her head. \"Do not pin your faith to that forlorn hope. Auchinleck is for once with his son Jamie. But Hales and"], [171, "THE VERDICT. 167 Pitfour, after remaining doubtful up to the begin ning of the week, have gone over to the enemy. Make up your mind to the worst, Jeanie. Be careful, for if you let yourself be taken by surprise, and think fit to skirl or swarf, and draw attention to us \u2014 besides causing more trouble to them that have trouble enough already \u2014 you need not look for quarter from me.\" \" I'll seek none,\" said Jeanie, not so much stung as pained by the distrust of her. \"You may count on me. I may not be so strong-minded as some folk, but I ken how to behave so as not to let my weakness be a burden either to friends or foes.\" \" I beg your pardon, Jeanie,\" said Lady Marget, humbly. \" I do not ken what possessed me to make that speech ; but oh ! my heart is sore. A sore heart cankers the best of tempers, and I never pretended that mine was anything out of the common,\" she finished, with a languid smile. \" Never mind,\" cried Jeanie, not to be outdone in generosity. \" As if you could not say what you liked to me ! As if I would not be a wretch to resent an idle word spoken at such a time ! \" \" Jeanie Erskine,\" pronounced Lady Marget, severely, \"if Davie Elphinstone ever gets you, you'll be the ruin of his temper, which, if all tales"], [172, "168 LADY JEAN'S SON. be true, is hasty enough already. Grant you your will, and you would spoil man or bairn that crossed your path.\" \" I hope not ; I hope you are wrong,\" answered Jeanie, with simple sincerity. As Lady Marget had arranged, she and her friend, with their tartan screens drawn well over their mob-caps and straying curls, and round their slim shoulders, were safely ensconced in a com paratively remote corner of the court-room, in order to be eye- and ear-witnesses of the verdict which concerned them nearly. There were the rows of judges ranged solemnly as before, with portentous faces under their wigs ; only one queer, eccentric specimen, who believed in syrens and mermaids, as well as in men's in conveniently near relationship to monkeys, fidgeted and made remarks to his irresponsive neighbours. There, still in conspicuous seats, were the great upholders of the contending parties, including restless Kitty of Queensberry and the dour daughter of Douglas of the Mains. She had carried her point all through life \u2014 even to the eventual twisting round her finger of her morose, vin dictive Duke \u2014 till now, when the spell threatened to fail. She was snorting heavily with anger and apprehension, and the drops of moisture were"], [173, "THE VERDICT. 169 standing out on her broad, swarthy forehead, drawn forth by her agony of alarm for the antici pated demolition of her pet project. For it signified the discomfiture and degradation of the bonnie boy whom she had taken to her heart in his childhood, to whom she had pinned her faith as the head of her house, her dead husband's nephew and lawful heir. There, in the background, were the magistrates and great \"merchants\" of the town \u2014 potent persons in their own sphere, allying themselves every day, through their sons and daughters, with the im poverished nobility and gentry. There were the pursuer and defender, each sitting in the middle of his regiment of lawyers. Mr. Andrew Douglas's long lank person bobbed about to an unusual extent in the centre of his supporters, though what he had at stake was as a feather's weight compared to what his opponent had in peril. Come what might, Mr. Andrew would still be Mr. Andrew Douglas of Douglas Place, a Lanarkshire laird of good family, kin to the late Duke of Douglas, and of such substance that even the costs of the case at this stage, sup posing they were to fall on him, would not ruin him stoup and roup. What ailed Mr. Andrew that he was so fidgety? Could it be that the"], [174, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 170 malpractices of his agents abroad, in which he had hitherto refused to believe, were at last forcing themselves on his notice, and weighing on his honourable mind ? As for Mr. John Douglas, an adverse decision would render him nameless as well as landless. It would not merely deprive him of the glories of Douglas Castle and the good heritage which went with it, of a position and career second to none in the county ; it would not only take from him his mistress, Lady Marget, it would cast him out of the circles in which he had been reared, and brand him as an impostor and outcast. Never theless, no face in all the assembly showed itself so unmoved as the face of John Douglas. Every now and then, in the swaying and surging process which agitates all large, deeply impressed audiences, charged to an extraordinary extent with the electric force of sympathy, the finely chiselled, passionless young face stood out in its calm mastery of the situation, in striking contrast to the strongly stirred faces round it. Davie Elphinstone might have borrowed a leaf from his client's book with advantage. If ever Davie were the great lawyer which it was in him to be, he must learn to control his features, and mask such a thunder-cloud of impotent wrath as"], [175, "THE VERDICT. 171 now sat on his frowning forehead and compressed lips. There were two persons in the body of the court who were the reverse of indifferent to the attitude of the principals. \" My Jock is bearing it like a man,\" said Lady Marget, proudly. \" The best Douglas among them never showed a more gallant front. The ' Black Douglas ' himself would not have disowned him.\" \" Poor Davie ! \" said Jeanie to herself wistfully. \"To have warstled as he has done for the case the whole of this month, to be thrown at last ! And he with nobody to go home to, to whom he might unburden his mind, who might persuade him to take rest and refreshment now that the battle is over ; nobody but a thoughtless laddie of a clerk, and a selfish wife of a landlady who had not the corners of her lodger's room so clean as I would have liked to see them.\" The votes were taken, seven judges on their consciences, to the best of their judgment and legal learning voted on either side, so perplexing and contradictory was the evidence, so near the issues. Was it a drawn battle ? Nay. The Lord President, Robert Dundas of Arinston, over whose unflinching head those letters breathing arson and"], [176, "172 LADY JEAN'S SON. murder were fluttering, deliberately and defiantly, like a brave gentleman and dauntless judge, gave his casting vote in favour of the pursuer, Mr. Andrew Douglas. Mr. Andrew's petition was sustained ; the Court of Session decreed that John Douglas, who had come into the great property and been already infest in it \u2014 according to the will of the late Duke of Douglas, which styled the young man the next-of-kin and the direct descendant, in the female line, of the late Marquis of Douglas, the Duke's grandfather \u2014 was not the son of Lady Jean and her husband Sir John. Thus he had neither right nor title to lands or name. In spite of the august character of the highest law-court in Scotland, there was a muffled roar as of distant thunder, immediately hushed, of applause on the one side, and condemnation on the other. Mr. Andrew Douglas bowed stiffly to the President and judges. A deeper wintry red rose and stained his high cheek-bones, and his under jaw fell slightly. His victory had not swept away the uneasiness which had lately beset him, and the instant his look travelled from the bench it turned furtively, yet as if by an irresistible fascination, to his vanquished antagonist. He also bowed to the great lawyers who had"], [177, "THE VERDICT. 173 discussed with such pains and patience the Douglas case. Except for a slight greyness which crept insidiously into the natural paleness of his com plexion, he did not betray a sign of emotion. His carriage was as erect, his bearing as graceful and gracious as ever. Yet one was vividly re minded of stories which have been told of men shot through the heart, or stabbed through the lungs, who have still stood for a few seconds on their feet, with undimmed eye and unfaltering lip, receiving death, as it were, with a courteous smile and a wave of the hand. That was but a passing impression. The next instant Mr. John Douglas, keeping his legs better than Mr. Andrew kept his, instead of tottering and falling prone, as a dead man would totter and fall, while he underwent the same process of being surrounded and clamoured over by his legal advisers and friends, was swallowed up by them as they marched in a body out of the court-room. \" It is a black shame ! \" cried the Duchess of Douglas furiously, in a loud, rude aside, while she stamped out in her turn. \" My luds are wrong for once,\" cried Kitty of Queensberry, shrilly, tossing her ill-balanced head as she spoke. \" But there is as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it. These are not the"], [178, "174 LADY JEAN'S SON. only luds in the kingdom, and we'll see what the others have to say to it, before we give up my lud's ward and my young squire.\" Jeanie's quivering face was hidden in her hands, |while Lady Marget was plucking at her friend's sleeve and saying sharply \u2014 \"Come away, Jeanie. They must guess we're here, but don't compel them to see us and inter change gude days with us. Beaten men that they are, as you said yestreen, they're sure to be stopped in the square. Nobody will stop us if we're quick \u2014 we can make our way through without an encounter.\" Outside in the square or close, the moving mass of human beings was heaving and splitting up into departing groups, while the air was ringing with cries of \"Shame! Treachery! The judges have been corrupted ; the Bench itself is rotten ! They prefer an auld carle like theirsels to a fine fellow like young Douglas.\" To which counter cries, fewer and less sonorous, responded, with provoking crouseness in their marked inferiority in volume: \"Weel done, Mr. Aundry, honest man. Hurray for the true representative of the wise-like, mensefu' auld stock o' the Dooglases \u2014 no a dressed-up foreign varlet ; no a new growth of the warming pan ; no"], [179, "THE VERDICT. 175 a popinjay of fine leddies' drawing-rooms, whose richt place should be, not working with his saft white hands among decent working bodies, but among the scum of a j ile like the Tolbooth yonder.

IT was all very well for the minority in the Parliament Close, whose man had won in the Parliament House, to assert their triumph and make stock of it on the spot ; the majority had but to bide their time, when retribution in some form would be dealt out by them. For some time after the union, an aggrieved national feeling smouldered and leapt up into dangerous flame, at intervals, in Scotland. This existed not merely among the ignorant and pre judiced, it had a place among the better-informed and more liberal inhabitants of the country, who were aware of the counter-balancing advantages which ought to have outweighed any losses sustained by Scotland in consequence of the gradual blending of Crowns and Parliaments into one powerful Government. Still, a sense of injury lingered and rankled, requiring several generations"], [181, "THE MOB'S AMENDMENT. 177 and a couple of rebellions to end it. It may seem odd to take this feeling into account in connection with the Douglas case, in which both pursuer and defender were Scotchmen, while the trial took place in the Scotch Court of Ses sion, to begin with. But it must be remembered that the judges were his Majesty's officials, and that the appointments to the higher dignities of the Scotch bar were made by the Govern ment in London, so that English influence was supposed to be paramount here as elsewhere. The Porteous riot, which had taken place about thirty years before the Douglas case was heard of, may serve as an illustration of the spirit of insubordination which was abroad with regard to the supposed miscarriage of justice. As an example of the lenient light in which Scotchmen of all classes viewed this insubordination, it is only necessary to quote the reply of John, Duke of Argyle, to Queen Caroline's angry threat that she would convert Scotland into a hunting-ground : \" In that case, madam, I will take leave of your Majesty, and go down to my own country to get my hounds ready.\" It was with the old feudal feeling still in force, and in natural response to any advocacy of their cause, that the Scotch populace entered M"], [182, "178 LADY JEAN'S SON. with fiery zeal into the merits of the Douglas suit, especially in reference to John Douglas. On the night of the day when the Scotch judges gave their verdict the Edinburgh mob was \" up \" with a vengeance. The girls, Lady Marget and Jeanie, beheld the turbulent rush of John Douglas's champions, together with some part of their wild performances, from one of the windows of the chief reception-room in Teviotdale House. The eager half-scared gazers on the spectacle had it so far to themselves. The Countess kept disdainfully to her parlour on the other side of the house, and to her knitting, treating such a vulgar display of feeling as beneath her notice. The Earl was laid up with a fit of the gout in his room, and was doing his best to drive his old valet to distraction. The main body of the servants who had not stolen abroad found their loopholes and points of vantage in different quarters of the house. Lady Marget, who had sent for Jeanie on the first whisper of the proposed entente, had secured the window for her self and her friend. They could stand in the darkened room, screened from observation and molestation by the heavy curtains, and command not only the opposite houses, crowded from top to bottom with spectators, but a considerable stretch of the Canongate, which, instead of being left to"], [183, "THE MOB'S AMENDMENT. 179 the deepening dusk of a summer night, feebly lit up by an occasional oil lamp, was blazing with links borne by hundreds in the gathering crowd. Lady Marget's eyes were glittering with sym pathetic excitement. Jeanie was peeping out with the mixture of awe and fascination with which one listens to a well-timed, well-told ghost story. In the street below, irradiated by the shifting fantastic lights, thrown into relief against the wavering grotesque shadows, as the streaming torches were held aloft and brandished at every imaginable angle, a dense crowd of human beings, huzzaing and hooting, gorged the space, and struggled, tore, and fought for a passage. As a matter of course, here and there a few wild-eyed, shrieking women, with crying, terrified children, were wedged into the mass of men. The larger proportion of the mob consisted of mechanics, journeymen and apprentices ; but, as on the occasion of the Porteous mob, there was also a considerable sprinkling of figures clearly belonging to a different class. These wore the loose great coats known as \"wrap-rascals,\" and had their faces half hidden by shawls called \" mufflers,\" used as neck-cloths, and by big slouched hats. The dis guise was, however, neither so complete nor so"], [184, "180 LADY JEAN'S SON. carefully maintained as to conceal the wearers from Lady Marget's searching inspection. \"Yonder goes Jock Pringle. There is Jamie Boswell. Look ! Jeanie, quick \u2014 see, the other side \u2014 and you'll find a cousin of yours in the middle of the hurly-burly. It is young Harry Erskine. Davie Elphinstone had better look to his laurels, for they say in a year or two Harry will reive the bonnet of every advocate in the Parliament House. Ah ! speak of the deil, here comes Davie's self. He has the same frown on his face as when he was in the court. He does not ken who is here, or he might look up. He's squaring his shoulders and seeking to get to the van to keep them back. He may spare his breath ; he might as well try to wear round the waves of the sea, and hold them in check. He'll get his coat torn from his back for his pains.\" Jeanie drew in her sobbing breath. \" Surely they'll ken their friends from their foes. They'll not do any sore damage, that would only tell against Mr. John Douglas's case. What are they seeking? What would they be at, Lady Marget?\" \" They're bound to smash every window in the house of every adverse judge,\" answered Lady Marget, with grim composure, which sounded not unlike satisfaction. \"Hark to the rattle of the"], [185, "181 THE MOB'S AMENDMENT. glass !

What for does no judge among them read the Riot Act, and send for the soldiers from the Castle ? \" \" I dare say the magistrates, worthy men, are consulting together in a change-house, as folk said they did the night Porteous was hanged, and it would be a daft judge who would put his head out of a window for any such object as reading the Riot Act on a night like this. Even Mont boddo would not try such a trick. As for the soldiers \u2014 they are not over fond of meddling with the gude town unless in a matter of dire necessity.

Mercy on us ! is that him ? \" broke off Lady Marget, with a cry of amazement and consternation, as a fresh detachment of the mob came in sight, and there, raised high on the shoulders of those in front, was perched such an armchair as was sometimes em ployed to do honour to the successful candidate in an election. Seated on the swaying seat, \" chaired,\" in fact, so as to be better seen by his escort, and by the throng in the street and at the windows, played upon by the fitful gleam of the torches, was a doddering figure in a velvet coat, lace cravat and cocked hat, bearing a speaking likeness to Mr. Andrew Douglas of Douglas Place, now of Douglas Castle, for was he not the success ful claimant of the headship of the race, with the corresponding patrimony ? As the noisy cavalcade advanced to the tuck of a drum of which they had possessed themselves, Mr. Andrew's bearers gave a great lurch which threatened to topple him down among the feet of the multitude, an imminent casualty which was hailed with yells of mocking laughter. \" Save him ! save him ! \" shrieked gentle Jeanie."], [187, "THE MOB'S AMENDMENT. 183 \"The poor gentleman will be felled. Is there nobody to take pity upon him ? \" \" Whisht ! you gowk ! \" cried Lady Marget, un ceremoniously, while she pulled back her companion and placed a hand on her mouth. \" Do you not see it is but his effigy ? I was deceived myself for a minute, the long back of him is that well done ; \" and Lady Marget giggled an echo to the laughter of the depredators. \" What will they do with it ? \" asked Jeanie, as somebody gave the figure of straw a great buffet in the side to make it sit straight. \" Oh ! it is a cruel pastime,\" she said again with a shudder. \"I should say,\" declared Lady Marget, not at all discomposed by the scurvy treatment which the improvised image of one of her suitors was receiving, \"they'll take it to Carubber's Close, where he's putting up with one of his agents, and they'll get a tar-barrel and a pound or two of gun powder. Then they'll prop him up in their midst, cleek hands, and dance round the blaze till it blows him up ! \" \" It's fearsome,\" maintained Jeanie. \" I wish I were at home. I'm not clear that our laddies are safe.

I would think little of laddies who kenned of such a ploy, and yet stayed still in their beds. What are they going to do now, think you? \u2014 for they've come to a standstill.\" The mob beneath the window were not slow to explain their pause. \"Jock Dooglas's lass bides here,\" cried a well-informed leader. \" A cheer for her ! a cheer for my Lady Marget Elliot ! \" shouted some of his followers. But before Lady Marget, with a mistaken sense that she was visible in the darkness in which she stood, could do more than recoil abashed and heart-stricken with the knowledge that she was Jock Douglas's lass no longer, the lusty cheer was strangled in its birth. Another voice rose high in wrathful contempt. \" That's a' in the wind now, billies. She's a fause jade ; it was Dooglas Castle, and not the bonnie lad that took her fancy.

It is hard enough being forced to desert him, without being called upon to listen to their unspeered-for opinion. I'll let them ken what heed I pay to it ! \" But the disordered march was already resumed, and the effigy of Mr. Andrew, with its uproarious bearers, passed out of sight. From a window of the house in Carubber's Close, Mr. Andrew Douglas beheld the brutal farce \u2014 to the credit of his courage, with much equanimity. He took a pinch of snuff upon it, and said philoso phically, \" The world is a whirligig. There will be a different kind of bonfire blazing the morn's night at Tod Law foment Douglas Place.

THE OLD ASSEMBLY ROOMS AND THEIR COMPANY. WHAT beating hearts and tripping feet, ardent hopes and ambitious dreams, were once carried up the old Assembly Close, into the Assembly Rooms, over which Mrs. Jacky Murray, a sister of Lord Mansfield, presided as mistress of the ceremonies. Mrs. Jacky Murray, a potent spinster in lace head and ruffles and voluminous hoop, with a carriage as upright as that of an oak sapling, with demurely mittened hands crossed in her brocade lap, was a host in herself where rules and precedents were concerned. No committee of fashionable matrons presiding over a select Almacks, no regiment of stewards responsible for their town or country balls, could equal Mrs. Jacky. The fame of her high position and in flexible will survived her generation ; order and propriety were safe in her keeping. The wildest member of the Hell-fire Club cowered under her"], [191, "THE OLD ASSEMBLY ROOMS. 187 challenge, the sauciest girl born to defy her elders and betters, collapsed before the sleepless vigilance of that pink of dignity and decorum. The most skittish and wilful of duchesses on her way to an oyster supper, in a den behind the Luckenbooths, modified her quips and restrained her pranks till she was out of sight and hearing of the aristocratic Mrs. Grundy. She was the Gorgon Edinburgh society had itself raised up, and continued to up hold and defer to, as a wholesome check on its genial liberty, approaching perilouslynear to license. There were certain hard and fast laws which regulated the old Assemblies. They were insti tuted for the season, that is, for the sitting of the Court of Session \u2014 the only court left in Edinburgh. As a rule they were discontinued by the middle of summer, when many of the subscribers had repaired with their families to their country houses. But in such a year as this, when a suit of the absorbing interest of the Douglas case had not only detained the bulk of the lawyers in town, but had brought up to the capital large contingents of the country gentry and nobility, either con nected by family relationship with the principals, or summoned as witnesses on either side, the social institution had lasted longer. The last ball of the season was not held till the remarkable"], [192, "188 LADY JEAN'S SON trial had come to an end, and the court was on the eve of adjournment. A much more arbitrary and irreversible arrange ment was that by which partners were chosen, and established in their rights, at the beginning of the season with no possibility of change, unless death or marriage intruded and broke the term of service. There was no light-minded variety about the process, neither was there any anxious uncertainty. A damsel with a partner secured to her, knew that he was at her beck for the next six or eight months, on the pain of the righteous vengeance of Mrs. Jacky. She would sooner pro nounce on him a sentence of expulsion from the Assemblies than admit his right to change his partner, who was like an old-fashioned valentine \u2014 \u25a0 to have and to hold \u2014 so far as dancing in public was in question, till the following year. There was no appeal from Mrs. Jacky's verdict ; it was doubtful if even her brother, the great judge in London, the bulwark of Scotch interests there, would have dared to dispute his sister's authority on polite manners, and the obligations of etiquette. Happily, the dancing to which the season's engagements referred did not amount to much. The enchanted ground was so circumscribed in its shabbiness and dinginess, and so crammed with"], [193, "THE OLD ASSEMBLY ROOMS. 189 good company, that it was hardly possible to do more than walk the stately minuet in the cleared space before Mrs. Jacky and the most distinguished dowagers who bore her company in the upper seats, and dance \"down and up again,\" \"down and up again,\" for as many sets of country-dances as could be ranged in rows at the lower end of the room. This was the locality of reels also, and here the restrictions were less stringent, and the company more promiscuous. In this region solemn and respectful silence was replaced by lively chatter and fun, which sometimes, in spite of Mrs. Jacky, verged on the fast and furious. The liveliness prevailed among those who might be termed the light skirmishers and rowdy volunteers of the Assemblies, the contingent of ladies and gentlemen who had been unfortunate in missing the privilege of \"walking\" the minuets, because the candidates had applied too late for admission to the lists of members to be present at the ceremony of drawing for partners. There was also a com pany of old and young, who for reasons of their own availed themselves of outlying or spare tickets, and were therefore merely occasional visitors, and not regular attendants at the balls. Of the first Mrs. Jacky did not wash her hands, but she did not view the interlopers in the same light as that"], [194, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 190 in which she regarded her regular charge. These met without fail on the first night of the season, when the great rite referred to, which was of vital consequence to the dancers, was scrupulously complied with. A trusty, well-accredited gentleman, a kind of henchman of Mrs. Jacky's, took his cocked hat from under his arm, and with a low bow, pre sented it, like a salver, to each lady in the circle, when she lightly dropped into it, with firm or tremulous fingers, her ivory fan. When the fans formed a heap in the cocked hat, it was time for the gentlemen to play their part. They crowded round the arbiter of destiny, and each man drew out a fan, to the owner of which the drawer was bound, for the Assembly's year, as a gallant partner and escort. Special eligibility, suitability, or personal choice had little or nothing to do in the matter, unless by what was implied in sharp eyes and a happy inspiration on the gentleman's side. On the lady's part a hint might be given by the involuntary appeal of a wistful glance, the tension of the figure in the attitude into which it had fallen, the low, nervous tap of a high-heeled slipper within the shelter of a hoop. If the gentleman was a courteous squire, was disposed to push his claims, or was warranted by"], [195, "THE OLD ASSEMBLY ROOMS. 191 intimacy or the foreshadowing of a troth-plight to stretch his rights to the uttermost, he might walk every Assembly evening, to the detriment of his full dress and powdered hair, to the house or lodgings of the lady and her family, might add his attendance to that of the footmen or link boys and caddies, in the guidance of her sedan chair through the concourse of the streets. Uncovered and bowing low, he might hand her out at the mouth of the Assembly Close, which was too narrow to admit of the encounter and the passing of sedan chairs on the road, and taking her by the tips of the fingers, lead her gingerly through the ranks of spectators to her seat. When the gala was over, he might accompany her home in the same manner. The sections of the country-dancers were shorn somewhat both of dignities and privileges. But it was imperative that gentlemen and ladies alike should be provided with corresponding tickets, on which the number of each couple's set, and their place in the set, were inscribed. Woe to any reckless and mutinous couple who disregarded these directions, and took up their station else where ; they were liable, on discovery, to be ignominiously expelled from the dance. The tickets conferred the additional boon that each"], [196, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 192 gentleman might wait on his lady in the tea room, present her with the simple refection of an orange at the end of every dance, and take her into the supper-room. On the night of the last Assembly of the season in the year of the Douglas case, there was a great gathering \u2014 not only of the regular members and the occasional frequenters of the scene, but of country gentry far and near, who, by the influence and introduction of friends, had succeeded in gaining admission for the night. There was much to see \u2014 of which to carry off rapturous reports, sufficient to excite the wonder and longing of the provinces. There were the fashions and the celebrities. The redoubtable Mrs. Jacky, on what was practically her throne, was somebody to stare at. So was Lady Eglin ton, who had given evidence in the Douglas case. The matronly beauty of the Countess, like that of Mrs. Cockburn, retained its red-and-white charm to the verge of old age. Her six fair daughters were largely married and dispersed. Those who remained showed the extraordinary brilliance and delicacy of complexions for which the troop was celebrated. It was said to owe its perfection to no more refined cosmetic than sow's milk."], [197, "THE OLD ASSEMBLY ROOMS. 193 Another notability was the gypsy beauty, Lady Anstruther of \" the Elie.\" She had been no com mon Egyptian, but the daughter and heiress of the great merchant house of the Faas of Dunbar. She was an Assembly belle, as Mrs. Jenny Faa, before she married Sir John Anstruther. Sir Joshua painted her in her pink satin, with her raven hair drawn up over a cushion, and a narrow black velvet band, bringing out the whiteness of her throat. Her charms of body and mind were freely said to have bewitched the sheriff of Fife when he gave his decision in favour of Sir John Anstruther, in the course of a contested election. But Jenny and her friends did not come off scatheless, for her gypsy origin (perhaps also her witchery) was cast in her husband's teeth on the hustings. The Duchesses of Queensberry and Douglas, who had figured so prominently in the great suit, who were now carrying off their defeat with a high hand, were here. They brought with them in their train a sight for strangers \u2014 Mr. John Douglas (alas ! he was adjudged M. Guillaume Dobr^e, but who dared breathe that name in their Graces' ears?), and the verdict pronounced on him by universal consent was, \"a braw young chield, looking as if nothing had happened to him.\" N"], [198, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 194 Yonder was Mrs. Cockburn, the literary dame de salon, as bright as she was bonnie, and as cordial as she was witty. She loved these balls, and took to them, week after week, and year after year, bevies of girls, most of them hailing from the Forest. \"Nancy and Peggy Rutherford, Agnes Keith, Christy Pringle, Babie Carnegie, Christy Anderson, and Jeanie Rutherford,\" represented only one batch. Their chaperon was the most indefatigable and sympathetic of chaperons ; she would bestir herself as joyously as if she were herself a girl, to find her girls partners \u2014 partners to their minds. It did not matter to her that it was four decades since, in order to twit a loutish youth, she had written the parody : \"Nancy's to the Assembly gane, All the beaux are chattering.\" It did not signify that she, who was still light of foot and light of heart in her mature years, able to forget her sorrows and cares, and, without loss of dignity, to stand up with an honoured old or young \"joe \" in a country dance, or to take a turn in a \" heartsome \" reel, had in her youthful bloom renounced the fashionable accomplishment of which she was passionately fond, and in which she excelled all her contemporaries, simply in affectionate deference to the prejudices of her aged"], [199, "THE OLD ASSEMBLY ROOMS. 195 father-in-law, the Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, with whom she and her husband had kept house. \" To please the bairns \" was always a much stronger motive with her, than to inspire awe or win admiration. In her zeal for the bairns' interests, that the sprightly band might have a sufficient following, she wrote that urgent appeal to her trusty coadjutor, \"With all your getting, get men.\" The men of the old Assemblies were not de pendent for distinction on those common qualities of pedantry and poverty which were marked attributes of the Scotch nobility and gentry of the day. Many of the judges who had sat on the great case, were in possession of individual traits. There was close-fisted \" skeich \" Buchan, the \"skeichest\" of Scotch peers, even with a bigger bee in his bonnet than music-mad \" Kelly,\" and there was \" Dumfries,\" who was not mad but drunk as usual. There was the pseudo Kew gardener, whom the school-girl, countess of Rothes, countess in her own right, fell in love with, and married, \" a prettily behaved man \" considering his origin, but like the husband of the grande mademoiselle, he was said to repay his mistress's devotion by bodily chastise ment. Had the Leslie heiress as magnanimous a"], [200, "196 LADY JEAN'S SON. heart as that owned by the uncouth generous daughter of France, when she asserted in excuse for her rough soldier, that the Bourbons required to be held in with a strong hand ? There was the poor divine John Home, a middle- aged man of letters, fresh returned from London. He still talked, in his simple egotistical way, of the battle of Falkirk, with his imprisonment while a rash student in the Castle of Doune, and of the triumphant representation of his play of \"Douglas\" at the Edinburgh theatre. Being a long-suffering, peace-loving man, he said less of the persecution of his stern brethren of the kirk, which compelled him to resign his parish and trust to his wits for a living. His \" modest dark eyes \" could still roll in a fine frenzy. His \" Norval \" would proclaim his name, and tend his sheep on his father's hills, in the mouths of spouting schoolboys, for genera tions to come. A much more potent divine condescended to grace the Assembly \u2014 Dr. Hugh Blair, whose wig was as symmetrically'elegant \u2014 like the side curls of the \"beaux\" whom Mrs. Cockburn commemorated \u2014 as was the rhetoric of his sermons. The young lions of the Parliament House were there, roaring as loudly as their dread of Mrs. Jacky would let them."], [201, "THE OLD ASSEMBLY ROOMS. 197 In the fiddlers' gallery there was a notable figure not to be forgotten. He was there for the playing of the reels, by the express favour of young Jean Maxwell, the future Duchess of Gordon, beginning betimes to wield her sceptre. She had already made his acquaintance, and she was soon to make his fortune. He was a dark-eyed, dark-com plexioned man, with close-clipped black hair, forming a strong contrast to the bag wigs, queues, and powder around him. He wore tartan breeches to his short coat, as became a thorough Celt. Absorbed in his own music, and entranced by it, he wielded a bow as magical as were Jenny, Lady Anstruther's glances. Well might the electrified listener ask enthusiastically : \" Oh ! haena you heard o' famous Neil, The man who loes the fiddle weel ? \" Perhaps it was to \"Neil Gow's farewell to whisky\" (satiric phrase!) and not to the usual \"Bob o' Dunblane\" that \"the heartsome set\" was danced on the portion of the floor set apart for reels and country dances.

LONG FAREWELLS. The Teviotdales were among the constant at tendants at the Assemblies. Nothing short of death or deadly sickness in the family,' would have prevented the Countess from making her appearance in her world. Neither did Lady Marget hang back this night ; she was even eager, for reasons of her own, to be present. Jeanie Erskine, too, found means and oppor tunity to be at this last ball of the season, with some of her cousins, the Buchan Erskines. Jeanie had a season-ticket, like every other well-born girl in the town ; but it was only at irregular intervals that her home duties and the state of the family finances permitted her to avail herself of it. She could not stay away to-night. She felt she had been so shaken by the incidents of the last week that the only cure \u2014 if it could be called a cure \u2014 for her mental disturbance, was to"], [204, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 200 plunge anew into the exciting circumstances which had caused her agitation. And the first person she saw on her entrance, while she was still employed disengaging her \" gauze tail,\" and shaking out her \" kissing strings,\" was Davie Elphinstone. He was standing just inside the door, as if on the watch, his arms folded, his eyes directed towards the arriving company. It was early for Davie, who was in the habit of burning the midnight oil over his law-papers, and only \" looking in \" towards the small hours, even at entertainments at which he had some expecta tion of meeting his Jeanie. John Douglas had drawn Lady Marget for his partner for the year, at the beginning of the season, which was also the date of their con ditional engagement. That had been brought to an end by the court's decision ; but \u2014 even if he had lost a dozen great estates, Lady Marget was still his partner, should he choose to claim her for this last Assembly. The only objection turned on a very nice technical question, which Mrs. Jacky herself might have found a difficulty in answering. His name was on the subscription list as John Douglas, of Douglas Castle, and as John Douglas he had the honour to be Lady Marget's partner. But if his real name was"], [205, "LONG FAREWELLS. 201 Guillaume Dobree, was not this contract also rendered null and void ? What became of the false Count Horn's engagements in the gay world of London, when the real Simon Pure turned up ? Did the engagements pass with the name and title to the true man ? or were they still so far the property of the masquerading lacquey, as to be used by him when the attentions of the officers of the law would permit ? The riddle was not openly propounded, for, after all, there was no proper parallel between the two cases. John Douglas had been reared from childhood in the circle in which he sought to move. He had no lack of powerful friends and connections, who had declared their belief in his claims ; who stuck manfully and womanfully to him, in spite of the blow which had been dealt to his pretensions. In the present day, we do not at once refuse the right-hand of fellowship to our recent ally, who has become bankrupt under somewhat painful circumstances, or who has got into a scrape, from which he has not emerged with his reputation absolutely spotless. We are sorry, we are affronted, we are prepared, perhaps, gradually to drop him ; but our first humane impulse, unless we are rigidly righteous, is not to show our virtuous indignation by making an example"], [206, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 202 of the detected culprit, but to greet our quondam familiar friend very much as we greeted him yesterday, apart from an involuntary confusion of countenance, which as a rule is more on our part than on his. We must let him down by degrees ; the old association must have time to die, and receive a decent burial. Thus, when John Douglas appeared under the august auspices of their Graces of Douglas and Queensberry, and as usual advanced and bowed low to Lady Marget, she took his arm without an instant's hesitation, while Lady Teviotdale, though looking grimmer than her wont, did not venture to interfere. But it goes without saying, that every eye in the room was on the couple, as they stepped forward to occupy the space just vacated in front of Mrs. Jacky Murray and the highest and mightiest of the dowagers, and stood ready to walk their minuet. A ring of spectators was in the habit of encircling the minuet-dancing, with which the ball began, and of surrounding the elite of the company especially selected to take part in it and to witness it. On this occasion the circle increased with the rapidity of lightning into a dense crowd, each member of which was wedged into the smallest space of standing-room, to the destruction of trains and tempers."], [207, "LONG FAREWELLS 203 Mr. John Douglas and Lady Marget Elliot had been unanimously voted throughout the season the handsomest pair in the rooms. There had been an audience collected every Assembly night, to see the brilliant beauty dance with the hero of the hour. He was more than ever a hero to his partisans, since he was not only the principal in a memorable law case, he was the unfortunate victim of a malign fortune, the hap less human ball tossed here and there by adverse destiny, and at last in the act of being hurled from his high estate. Whispers, now and then audible, passed round the excited throng. \" Sirs ! what a stately, bonnie lad. It is no possible that he's nought but a French glass-blower's son. Dinna tell me sic an impossibility.\" \"What a grand-looking lass ! with lilies and roses in her cheeks and een like diamonds.\" \" Puir things ! Puir things ! Wow, but their hearts maun be heavy, though their feet are licht.\" Powdered heads were shaking, dim eyes were wiped behind convenient fans, in sympathy with the performers in a drama \u2014 the woes of which were so much more real, so much less artificial than suited the formal courtly measure the dancers were treading. Weep, or groan, or whisper who might, there was not a sign of disorder in the youthful couple"], [208, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 204 who were following the mazes of the difficult dance, with its elaborate advances and with drawals, profound bows and curtseys, which no modern backs and knees have the patience, the seriousness, the deep sense of responsibility to accomplish with any approach to the success of the members of former generations. Lady Marget and Mr. John Douglas were dancing for the approbation of Mrs. Jacky and her com peers, and for the edification of the onlookers in general. No private grief, however heart rending, could cause the two to fail. Only an earthquake might have broken down their for titude, routed their courage, and put an end to that heroic, piteous, exquisite poem of two dancers. Among the company favoured by the singular spectacle Mr. Andrew Douglas, of Douglas Castle, by the award of the Court of Session, was not present. He did not appear at this Assembly \u2014 some said from modesty and magnanimity, some from nothing less prosaic than an un timely twinge of the gout. Anyhow, he escaped sundry other twinges yet harder to bear, which the last glimpse of Lady Marget and his oppo nent in love and war, as well-matched partners at the Assembly, might have given him. Cer tainly he was not brandishing his triumph in"], [209, "LONG FAREWELLS. 205 the face of his young adversary, and rejoicing over him in a vaunting and insolent manner. Mr. Andrew's blood was cool and his head steady, as the result of long years of integrity and discretion. He was a worthy gentleman as well as a canny, though his agents had com mitted iniquities unknown to him and unautho rized by him. He was a man moderate and measured in all his tastes and pursuits. He had been well content to be the Laird of Douglas Place. It was doubtful if he would quite know what to do with the great possessions of the late Duke of Douglas, or what to make of himself as the grand seigneur of Douglas Castle, now that he had won his suit. It was not till their minuet was over and another couple were about to take the place of the pair who had created the sensation of the evening, that Lady Marget showed tokens of fatigue, which compelled her to take advantage of an empty bench to rest for a few minutes before rejoining her mother. Lady Marget's partner stood by her and looked down at her wistfully. \"Jock,\" she said slowly, but without faltering, \"this must be our last dance; there is no help for it, unhappy twain that we are.\""], [210, "206 LADY JEAN'S SON. \"I know it, Lady Marget,\" he answered, in his deep man's voice that yet shook a little, in spite of his marvellous self-control. \" Do not dream that I'll ever blame you, any more than I blame myself for indulging in a dream of Paradise.

It was as if he had said, \"And thou too, Lady Marget! \" He spoke again after a moment's pause. \" I believe as my dead mother \u2014 her that I called mother \u2014 told me. She was a true mother to me and to my twin brother. I believe as my dying father swears.

I'll never forget it or you, my love, let my years stretch to man's utmost span, let seas roll between us.\" She bowed her head gratefully. \" I ask your pardon for the unwitting wrong I did you,\" he added, in the same tender, troubled tone. \" Don't, don't ! \" she cried, in a half-choked voice, putting up her hands to ward off his words, as if they were so many blows ; and he stood again silent at her side. Then she began to speak with strange humility. \" Jock, my man, will you tell me what you mean to do ? You said something of seas rolling between us \u2014 does that signify you think of going to foreign parts ? \" \"Yes,\" he answered directly, \"if the idea of our appeal to the House of Lords should fall through.\" \"But why should it?\" she demanded eagerly,"], [212, "208 LADY JEAN'S SON. with a gleam of hope kindling afresh in her bright blue eyes. \" Well,\" he said quietly, \" my good friends, especially the Duchess of Queensberry, are dead set on it at this moment, though what they may be, when they've time to cool down and look at all sides of the question, without reflecting un handsomely on their tried fidelity to a solitary ill starred devil like me, it would be hard to say. I must confess, for my own part, that I think it is more than improbable that the Lords in London will go against the judges here. The case has already cost a fortune, of which I'm grieved to think I and my father, who has my brother Charles's interests to think of, can only pay a moiety. Is it for me to urge or even permit, if I can prevent it, my aunt the Duchess of Douglas, and my late guardian Queensberry, with other generous up holders of my cause, to fling good money after bad, and throw away another fortune on the merest peradventure ? \" Her expressive face had been falling while he spoke, for she was too clear-headed and high spirited not to acquiesce in his reasoning. \"But you have not told me what you are going to do in Holland \u2014 or is it Germany?

She felt a kind of burning shame in the consciousness that she had renounced the right to question him, or to act as if his affairs were hers. All the same it was her conviction still, that it would be impossible for her to do otherwise.

He had managed that the numbers on their tickets should corre spond, and when the time for the country dances came, he led her to their appointed set and place. Their tune was \" The White Cockade,\" to be followed by that of \"The Country Bumpkin.\" The first well-remembered badge held painful associations for many persons present ; but that was a robust, thick-skinned generation. Davie Elphinstone, instead of taking his place opposite his partner, and being watchful that they should comply with their obligations when their turn to dance drew near, passed over to the ladies' side, and insisted on engaging Jeanie in an agitating conversation. He would not attend to the point at which he ought to have been in the ranks of the gentlemen, crossing hands, setting to his vis-a-vis, or turning his partner. He had to be jogged and hustled into doing his duty, at the risk of throwing the whole set out by his neglect and preoccupation.

Jeanie could easily forgive any asper sion of her own motives, but her filial reverence and her family affection were great, and she would not have readily condoned any slighting reflection on her father, or any lack of consideration for her laddies and lassies. He took a new and more insidious course. He said solemnly, \"Jeanie, I swear if you were once mine I would do all in my power to be a son to your father, by looking after his worldly comfort and ease. You know my own father and mother, though they cannot endow me with wealth, or so much as an additional allowance, need nothing at my hands.

At the same time he raged against his impotency to move her. The moment the dance was over he departed from her in dudgeon. He took extreme, unwarrantable offence because the soft-hearted girl, whom he could twist round his finger, in the superiority of his intellect and in the tenderness of her love for him, who forgave all his taunts, since they were the outcry of his disappointment and mortification, yet who the instant a question of duty was touched, changed into a pillar of stone in her inflexibility. She would shield him from himself, from his own lower nature and more headstrong passions, till her weak arms dropped powerless by her sides. Blessed is the man whose sweet girl-love rises into a guardian angel in the hour of need."], [221, "CHAPTER XIII. THE SUIT THAT WAS DESTINED TO FAIL. THE autumn and winter months after the decision in the Douglas case in the Court of Session involved a period of reaction, with a dull and depressing effect on the men and women who had been chiefly concerned in it, especially on those who remained in Edinburgh. For Mr. John Douglas and his friends departed for London. Rumours came at intervals of what was going on in the capital. Generally they were sinister rumours ; for Edin burgh, in the person of her judges, did not care to have the authority of their ponderous learning and wisdom questioned, granted that they had been a house divided against itself, with the verdict given on the casting-vote of one man. It was commonly said that the Lords \u2014 the majority of whom were, of course, Englishmen, much taken up with English affairs just at this moment \u2014 would seize the opportunity of showing how little value they attached to Scotch business,"], [222, "218 LADY JEAN'S SON. and how disinclined they were to be pestered by it. They would either discover some technical flaw in the appeal to their higher jurisdiction, which would enable them to dismiss the appeal with scant ceremony, or they would postpone the hearing of the case again and again, till the expectation of the public and the hearts of the petitioners were alike wearied out. Then the petitioners would be reduced to submit to a hurry scurry inquiry which must, in all probability, result in a confirmation of the judgment of the Court of Session. If there were people qualified to see farther, and to aver that the House of Lords could not \u2014 either in legal conscience or in constitutional dignity \u2014 thus easily dispose of a case, whether Scotch or English, which had been referred to their ultimate decree \u2014 these people were in the minority, and some of them were silent either from prejudice or expediency. It was commonly and cannily held that all who insisted the Lords must give a due hearing to the Douglas case, were the hot-headed supporters \u2014 many of them young fellows like him self \u2014 of the lad calling himself Mr. John Douglas, and the sworn opponents of the successful litigant, Mr. Andrew Douglas, now reigning in all the glory of possession, which was nine-tenths of the law,"], [223, "THE SUIT THAT WAS DESTINED TO FAIL. 219 at Douglas Castle. The public were pointedly reminded how confident this defeated party, com posed largely of the credulous, the rash, and the ignorant, and of the ultra-Scotch element in the higher ranks and in the law courts, had been of the indisputable claims of their hero, and of his partisans triumphantly establishing him in the halls of his ancestors (he whose ancestors had been proved the veriest scum of Paris and its environs !). It was well that such a gross imposition and monstrous fraud had been exposed and brought to nothing. Still more cautious persons did not wish to commit themselves to too pronounced an opinion either way. The Press, as represented by the Scots Magazine, was very wary, and it was a considerable journey in those years between Edinburgh and London, so as to get at the truth of what was likely to occur at head-quarters. It was certain that the Government was then much occupied with trying to find out the author ship of the Junius letters, and with the prosecution of Mr. Wilkes, so that the Douglas case had been temporarily set aside. The year was passing. The Teviotdale family had found leisure to repair to Teviotdale for their annual visit. Jeanie Erskine had carried her obstreperous young family for a breath of sea"], [224, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 220 air, as far as Leith, while Eppie Caw had made a shift to look after the wants of Mr. Simon Erskine, who never forsook the Hammermen's Close, summer or winter, whether the courts were up or down. Winter had come again, with the return of the Court of Session to its onerous labours, the flitting back of all the families of degree to their town mansions and lodgings, the re-opening of the season's Assemblies, and the re-instalment of Mrs. Jacky Murray in her office of Mistress of the Ceremonies. Nay, spring had succeeded winter, and summer spring, yet nothing more was heard from autho rized sources of the prosecution of the Douglas case. Several of the principal lawyers who had been engaged in the suit, were known to have gone to London from time to time, to lay their heads to those of their English brethren of the long robe ; but the proceedings were kept very close, save to the initiated. An air of despair stole over the defender's adherents in the outer circle, which led to the suspicion that any revival of the suit was likely to be strangled in its birth. The Teviotdale household went again into Roxburgh, and after their return to Edinburgh in October, Jeanie Erskine chanced not to see"], [225, "THE SUIT THAT WAS DESTINED TO FAIL. 221 Lady Marget for some little time. Jeanie had been a good deal occupied with family concerns \u2014 with the outfit of her eldest brother, who had got a midshipman's commission through the influence of his kinsman, Lord Buchan, and had gone to join his ship. In addition, Jeanie had troubles of her own, which were making her fair face look sedater than ever, in its sweetness. Davie Elphin stone had taken her at her word, and had not sought to cross her path for more than a year, not since the last Assembly, after the conclusion of the Douglas case. Worse than that, he was gone to London, without so much as seeking to take leave of her before he went. She supposed he would return to the Scotch Bar at which his practice lay ; but what inducements to tarry in the south might beset him, or how his fancy might be taken by the English lasses, with whom he was sure to foregather, who would have all the charm of novelty to him, and would doubtless be more genteel, with softer tongues and prettier ways, and be freer to receive his advances, so that he need no longer cling to a forlorn hope, Jeanie could not say. Another thing vexed the girl \u2014 a very little, as she told herself with a certain disdain, still it was sufficient to fret the care-ridden young soul with"], [226, "222 LADY JEAN'S SON. a new care. A son of the Lord Chief Justice, a budding advocate, had come occasionally of an evening, during the preceding winter, to the Hammermen's Close, about some law business with which Mr. Simon Erskine had to do. The young gentleman, a lad of taste and penetration, had found another attraction than that of the old lawyer to the house. Jeanie was guiltless of giving the youth the slightest encouragement, but she had a horrible suspicion that her father did not even remain neutral. She had reason to be- lieve that he set such store upon her, that he had absolutely refused to listen to the suit of her own lad, Davie Elphinstone ; yet here was he actually looking with some complacence on an interloper's pretensions ! True Mr. Simon Erskine had, as a matter of necessity, to stay away from his tavern and receive the son of his chief, when he came on business, which, for aught Jeanie knew to the contrary, might be the business of the Lord Chief Justice. True, also, that Mr. Simon Erskine was too loyal to his employer, and too much of a gentleman on his own account, to be otherwise than innocent of any overt art to win such a suitor for his daughter. He would let the matter run its course \u2014 that was all. He would neither tempt the somewhat precocious wooer, nor would he"], [227, "THE SUIT THAT WAS DESTINED TO FAIL. 223 force his daughter's inclinations. Just leave things to go their own gate, at their own rate. But if affairs prospered, here would be a proper down sitting for Jeanie, in ten or fifteen years' time. The match would be a credit to her family, and in that light he would be able to do more than endure it. In the course of ten or fifteen years' time the other girlies would be women grown, and have learnt sense, and the lads would be adrift, pushing their fortunes. It was not that he objected to marriage in the abstract, for Jeanie or any young woman who had reached the years of discretion ; but that she should enter upon it hastily with a penniless, head-strong fellow, like Elphinstone, whose father was little better than a cock-laird, instead of a Lord Chief Justice, was not to be thought of. It was not to be suffered for a moment that Jeanie, in the words of the plaintive nuptial song, should \" Aye be awa' ! awa' ! \" at the very time when she was most wanted. Who would have looked after the house, brought up the younger bairns, and seen to Mr. Simon Erskine's peace and comfort, in ordering the quiet and economy of his breakfasts and dinners, if that fellow Elphinstone had got his unheard-of"], [228, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 224 will ? But young Archie Hope, ten or fifteen years hence, was a great odds. When had Jeanie seen her father so crouse, and prepared to expatiate at length on what might interest his young guest? When had she known him so considerate and attentive to her self? He had gone so far as to offer her money for new ribands and fal-lals, and to ask if she would like to go to the Saturday promenades on Leith Sands, suppose a fitting escort presented himself? It was not that Mr. Simon had ever failed in solid kindness to his offspring, but it was as if something had suddenly called his atten tion to his eldest daughter, and impressed him with the conviction that above and beyond her long faithful services to her kindred, she might suddenly become a crowning credit to them. Jeanie's heart was very sore under this new trial ; she had it in her even to give up Davie Elphinstone for the sake of the duty she owed, and was called on to fulfil to her father and his family. She was convinced, as she had said, that no blessing would wait on her and Davie if she failed in her first allegiance as a daughter and sister, or if she brought a stigma on her lover and herself, by joining him in an irregular marriage. He would be better without her"], [229, "THE SUIT THAT WAS DESTINED TO FAIL. 225 when it came to that. It would be made up to him, and no doubt he would be happy with another woman in time, Jeanie told herself with a dry sob in her throat ; and she would be content \u2014 in time, when she saw him happy, and knew herself a stand-by to her family. But she would never wed another, for that would be false- hood and mockery. She would live and die single, and be an old maid for Davie Elphin- stone's sake, if she could not be his wife ; she should at least have that comfort. As for the raw laddie, Archie Hope, she could have laughed in his smooth rosy face at his presumption \u2014 for it was gross presumption in him to suppose he could fill Davie Elphinstone's shoon. But her laughter might anger her father, or it might come to the ears of the Lord Chief Justice and offend him, though he would be the last to desire the match, and that was not to be thought of. It was safer, after all, just to be very stiff and a wee snappish, when her temper could stand the infliction no longer, to the forward \" halflin \" \u2014 as Jeanie termed the young gentleman, who was at least two years her senior \u2014 in the height of her contemptuous wrath. But what if the absurd story got wind ? if the birds of the air carried it the length of London, P"], [230, "226 LADY JEAN'S SON. and to so hot-headed a chield as Davie Elphin stone ? It was this apprehension and the dread of the miserable misunderstanding which might arise from it, which kept poor Jeanie awake many a night, tossing on her not over soft bed, in the small space allowed her by the young sisters, who slept the untroubled sleep of irresponsible girlhood, one on each side of her guardian. The seal of something like a horrified certainty was set on Jeanie's trembling fears when Nanzie Boyd, making one of her kitchen calls, and coming to have a word in the privacy of the parlour with Mrs. Jeanie, challenged her with the freedom of an old friend. \"Eh! Mistress Jeanie, what's this I hear? and you never to let on to your auld handmaiden, who would be as proud as a peacock to learn the truth from yer ain lips.\" \"What truth, Nanzie?\" inquired Jeanie, with a sinking heart, but a brave attempt to present a front of dignified reserve to the privileged assailant. \" What have I had to tell you among my own concerns, that I've not let on about ? \" \" What but aboot the grand new beau that is coming aboot the hoose, and no for Miss Ailsie?

THE SUIT THAT PROSPERED. It was a relief and diversion to Jeanie's mind to hear that the Teviotdale family had returned to the Canongate. She set out in better spirits than she had been in for some time, to inquire for the family, and pay her respects to Lady Marget. But before Jeanie had traversed the few paces between the Hammermen's Close and Teviotdale House, she heard such news as caused her another pang. It was not that the old Earl was dead ; it was not that the Countess had lost her reason. It was another tale that the dress maker, the mantua-maker, the corset-maker, the man who had come from the shoemaker to measure Lady Marget's foot, the mercer's lads, who were carrying such bales of goods for in spection that two had been told off for the service, were each and all burning to impart to all whom it might concern. Each of the emis saries was prepared to tell the same tale, which"], [235, "THE SUIT THAT PROSPERED. 231 their combined presence was enough in itself to convey. However ruefully Jeanie might receive it, she could not decline to accept the testimony of her own eyes and ears. Some of the witnesses worked for Jeanie also, in a small way, and were known to her, both as highly respectable trades people and as old acquaintances. Mrs. Primrose had gentle blood in her veins, and Miss Mysie Cumming was the daughter and sister of sub stantial Edinburgh burghers, so that their veracity was beyond suspicion. Neither did Jeanie know how to contradict them when the one proclaimed, exultantly, \" It is the grandest match I've been bidden provide for this many a day ! \" And the other chimed in, \" 'Deed, I can say the same. But for the title, it would be little ahint Miss Jean Maxwell's.\" Then, in the middle of the speaker's satisfaction, she allowed the sentimentality of her sex to peep out in a solitary regret. \" It is a peety, though, that bride and bridegroom were not better suited in years. She is so young and bonnie \u2014 one of the beauties of the gude toon, and the unhappy laud, who had her troth-plight for a season, and lost it with his lands and his name, was a better match for Leddy Marget in that licht.

I'm sure Mr. Aundry Douglas's sprush and wise-like for his age, and a most proper gentleman in ilka other respeck,\" Mrs. Primrose took it upon her to rebuke her colleague's indiscretion. Jeanie, who had stood dumb, roused herself to murmur some words of acquiescence, and excused herself for hastening on to have her interview with Lady Marget. The visitor could almost have fancied that there was an air of consciousness and elation about the servants who admitted her, and handed her on to her destination. She was not shown into the great drawing-room, but into the small room where the Countess usually sat. There Jeanie found both the mistress of the house and Lady Marget, who had not been wont to see much of her mother, unless at meal times and when there was other company. The ladies were sitting resting after an important discussion in which the functionaries whom Jeanie had encountered as they left the house had borne a respectfully authoritative part. The round table between the Countess and Lady Marget was heaped with laces, feathers, furs, and fans ; the chairs and settee were piled with webs of fine muslin, cloth and silk. Even the Countess's"], [237, "THE SUIT THAT PROSPERED. 233 satin-wood wheel had been brought into requisition and used as a lay figure ; the rock had a hood fitted on it, and the body of the wheel was robed fantastically in a roquilaire.

You'll lend us the benefit of your taste. Do you think this Mechlin neglige'e looks as handsome as that Valenciennes one ? I'm uncertain. This is not a question of wear, I must remind you, for these duds are going where new may be ordered every day of the year, without counting the cost.\" \" Yes, Jeanie, I may break the shops, and have my coats of velvet and my shifts of cambric without wasting a hoast on the bill,\" cried Lady Marget, with a laugh that was more scornful than mirthful. \" Come and sit you down by me, and give us the help of your counsel.\" Jeanie took the seat which Lady Marget pushed forward, and tried to make herself useful ; but how ever light or heavy Lady Marget's heart might weigh, Jeanie felt her heart like lead, and could not resist the sensation that she was assisting at the preparations for a burial rather than a bridal."], [238, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 234 Lady Marget, though she was perfectly composed, and carried matters with a high hand, had grown very thin within the last twelve months, and looked as if she might age prematurely. The old Earl hirpled in, and nodded to his daughter's friend. \" Blythe work for maiden fingers,\" he said jocosely. \" It will be your turn next, Miss Jean. Meg will give you a rub of her shouther,\" alluding to the merry fancy that contact with the shoulder of a bride or bridegroom rendered matrimony an epidemic. But though he looked pleased he was as restless as ever, and now and then his bushy grey eyebrows met in a troubled frown. Presently the girls were left alone together, and looked in each other's faces with a long piteous look. Lady Marget spoke first. \" Is it to be your turn next, Jeanie ? \" she asked defiantly. \" I heard something of young Archie Hope finding his way to the Hammermen's Close, anent law papers, of course, two or three evenings a week last winter, and this spring, before we went down to Teviotdale.

I've to remain at my post, keep house for my father, see the rest of his bairns established in life, and nurse his old age.\" \" I'm glad to hear it,\" said Lady Marget, with a long-drawn sigh, fastening and unfastening a diamond buckle as she spoke. \" I would have been sorry to lose my conceit of you, Jeanie. I'm glad to think there is somebody in the world true to death, and that you are that somebody. I hope he'll be worthy of your constancy ; I always kenned you were of a different clay from me. Why is it ? It is not because I've given myself up to idle-set. I could not live without being up and doing, let it be at mischief. I've been as diligent in my way as you in yours.\" \"That is true,\" owned Jeanie, willingly; \"you've read your French and practised your spinnet, when I could not spare half an hour to either of them.\" \" But my work,\" continued Lady Marget, pur suing her reflections without listening to her com panion, \" was made up of reading French and"], [240, "236 LADY JEAN'S SON. strumming tunes, drawing pattern for ruffles and embroidering them, tambouring and knotting, painting on velvet and pinking it out, and the like.

Davie Elphin stone is not lost to you to this day, as somebody has been to me for a year and more.\" \" Are you not over hasty, if nothing else ? \" interrupted Jeanie, pleading for what she con ceived was her friend's last chance of happiness. \" If the appeal to the Lords be sustained, it is within reason that the Court of Session's decree may be reversed; Mr. John Douglas may yet \" \" Hold your tongue, lass ; not another word,\" Lady Marget forbade imperiously, while a tide of blood surged into her face and retreated, but not before it had set the roses in her cheeks on fire"], [241, "THE SUIT THAT PROSPERED. 237 with a burning blush. \" I tell you, let sleeping dogs lie. Do not raise ghosts that have been laid decently for months.\" \" Why did you not bide a wee ? \" said Jeanie, still in accents of reproach. \" It would have been useless,\" declared Lady Marget, desperately. \" The Lords will never right the wrong the Court of Session has done.

But whether I can succour him or not, in the long run, it is better to put him as well as myself out of pain, without more loss of time.

It is the dergie of my heart, and its first and last love you're to have a hand in, Jeanie, my woman. Mr. Aundry and me are to be wed by the minister of the town within the month ; we've come up to the town express for the purpose ; and you'll not refuse to be my best maid ? \" Jeanie gave an involuntary shiver. \" Na, you need not trouble,\" remonstrated Lady Marget ; \" it is not such a very uncommon process \u2014 the death and burial first, and the marriage to follow fast.

He is an honourable, worthy gentleman, and a friend of the family. You are doing the will of your father and mother.\" Lady Marget laughed not an altogether pleasant laugh, though her voice was naturally sweet. \"Ay; but I ken also that I'm a mean, worldly wretch.

It is clear Mr. Aundry must have a lady to help him to bear the burden of his honours before they crush the fikes out of him, and crush the man with his fikes.

Lady Marget's marriage did not take place at the time or in the circumstances indicated, though she had welcomed the seven-leagued strides of its approach with the wayward longing of a sick and weary heart for the crisis of her fate to be over, and her future fixed beyond recall. It was not an inoppor tune attack of gout, or gangrene in the earl's crippled knee, which was the obstacle. It was Lady Teviotdale, ordinarily as strong in body as she was stout of heart and stern of will. She had been from the first the great promoter of the match between her daughter and Mr. Andrew Douglas ; she had been rejoicing in her high and dry way, at its fulfilment, when she fell ill so seriously and tediously, that Lady Marget's marriage was in evitably postponed, from the early autumn to the spring of the coming year.

As it was wearing on to the \" daft days \" between the old year and the new, more definite and in spiriting tidings with regard to the Douglas case began to arrive by every fortnight's coach, and from private hands travelling by post from London. The appeal was to come before the Lords, now that Mr. Wilkes's offences were disposed of, and it was set down for the earliest working days in January. Mr. John Douglas's counsel, and his powerful friends who were with him in London, were bestirring themselves to the utmost, and were beginning to be hopeful once more. It was rumoured that the Lords would call upon Mr. Andrew Douglas's agents, native and foreign, to produce their private papers, the notes they had made, and the recognizances they had taken, before the witnesses were brow-beaten and intimidated by the proceedings in the French Court of the"], [247, "THE TIDE TURNS. 243 Tournelle, and by the Archbishop of Paris' man- date, so that the earlier depositions of the French witnesses might be compared with the later, to the confusion of face of other than the absent witnesses. It was also said it would be shown that the Cure who had given evidence as to the removal of one of the peasant children from his parents and his native village was labouring under an error so far as Sir John Drummond's having had anything to do with the removal. In fact, it would be proved beyond contradiction, that Sir John and Lady Jean had quitted France, and repaired to London, with their twin children, at a date previous to that of the borrowing, buying, or stealing of this last child. Finally it was bruited about that there had been the recovery of a packet of Lady Jean's letters written to Sir John when he was living in the King's Bench prison, and she was living with her maid and children at Chelsea, and elsewhere, pinching herself while she catered for his wants. And it would move the heart of a stone to read the motherly terms in which the poor lady wrote of her \" little men,\" how they were to get their hair cut before they went to see their father again, and what store they set on the toys he had kept by him for them. There was no question of the genuineness of these simple, natural"], [248, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 244 letters, and it was a moral impossibility that either Sir John or Lady Jean could ever have contem plated her share of the correspondence coming before the world. In the interval, between the suit's being argued before the Court of Session and its being taken up by the House of Lords, Sir John Drummond had died, ending his aimless, shiftless, Bohemian career in more solvency and respectability than might have been anticipated in its earlier stages. Nursie, too, had travelled into the shadowy land after her old master and mistress. But these two important witnesses had left behind them solemn attestations, which had been made on the testators' death-beds, in the presence of clergymen and law yers \u2014 good and credible persons \u2014 that Mr. John Douglas was no other than the lawfully born surviving twin son of Sir John and Lady Jean. Again Edinburgh rang from end to end with the fortunes of the Douglas case. The arrival of the London coach with the mail containing the news-letters was eagerly watched and waited for, that the letters and news-prints might be greedily read, and pass through innumerable hands, while the contents became the engrossing topic of the hour, till fresher intelligence arrived. As the groups gathered in front of the coach-"], [249, "THE TIDE TURNS. 245 office in the High Street, sentimental and realistic gossips were wont to recall it was by this very coach that poor Lady Jean, who had been used in her youth to different conditions, including the state maintained in travelling, as in everything else, by his Grace of Douglas, had made her weary peregrinations from and to London. On the last occasion she was too poor to afford herself the company of a maid. But nobody failed her among the plain, middle-class passengers \u2014 the younger sons of lairds, bound for the south to push their fortunes, ministers, writers, or merchants and their wives, who could not afford themselves a post chaise, even though they clubbed their means together for the journey. Which among the company, from the highest to the lowest, had not been ready to befriend the fallen great lady, who was so humble, affable and garrulous, making her plaint to all who would listen ? The last news-letter was believed to have been written by no less a person than Advocate Elphinstone, one of the defendant's junior counsel, a very promising young limb of the law up in London for the defence. The letter brought word of a wonderful acquisi tion made just in time. A young English barrister had been wanted to open the case,"], [250, "246 LADY JEAN'S SON. English fashion, in a telling speech before the Lords. The Scotch lawyers had been at a loss where to find the best man for their purpose. Then followed the droll story of these Scotch visitors to the Metropolis, having repaired for a little seasonable recreation to Novado's coffee house, where the junior barristers were wont to meet, smoke, and discuss the events of the day, debating with each other, as good practice for future pleadings in the law-courts. There the strangers happened to hear a certain wild billy from Cambridge, one Thurlow, a rough diamond, a black-visaged lad, whose wig nearly met his heavy eyebrows, descanting, as he sat over his steaming punch, for the mere pleasure of exercis ing his gift of the gab, flooring the men who were opposed to him, in favour of Mr. John Douglas and his chances in the great case. The young man spoke with such power and eloquence that the most interested of his listeners had a happy inspiration. \" Here is our man ready dropped from the skies ; though unknown to fame as yet, he'll make a spune or spoil a horn before he has done. Dod i we'll risk it ! \" they told each other, and engaged the fledgling barrister on the spot. The gawsy Scotch writers who took the initiative and made"], [251, "THE TIDE TURNS. 247 the venture, were not wrong in their calculations, as events proved. The trial before the Lords lasted twelve days, and the London coach arrived once in the interval, while all Edinburgh and Scotland hung breathless on its tidings. The case was receiving the greatest possible attention. Thurlow's splendid oration had roused and stirred his audience, while the House was packed from doorway to doorway. The Lord Advocate had spoken for Mr. John Douglas in a speech which lasted fourteen hours. Mr. Wedder burn had replied for Mr. Andrew Douglas in a speech of twelve hours' duration. The Lord Chancellor had spoken for three hours in a great speech in support of the defender. The Duke of Newcastle was on the right side, but the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Sandwich were on the wrong. There had been challenges given and taken on account of words spoken in the heat of the discussion. Mr. Thurlow had gone out to meet one of Mr. Andrew Douglas's agents with sword and pistol in Hyde Park ; but on the first discharge of pistols neither of the principals was struck, whereupon the seconds had interfered, and the matter had been arranged. Mr. John Douglas had appeared one day in the House of Lords,"], [252, "248 LADY JEAN'S SON. along with the Duke of Queensberry, and had been the observed of all observers, while he sat listening with unruffled composure to the speeches of his friends and foes. Mr. Simon Erskine, in the dignified neutrality and magnanimity which, while asserting his parental authority, he had practised all along with regard to his daughter's sentiments for young Elphinstone, did not dream of depriving himself of the satisfaction to be derived from the news letter because it was liberally attributed to the same young fellow. In fact, Mr. Simon had no quarrel with Davie, though the elder man refused to accede to the younger's unreasonable request for the hand of Jeanie. Mr. Simon Erskine not only read the letter impartially, and discussed its contents at length with everybody of any intelligence, especially with every lawyer among his cronies in Edinburgh, in the very height of transparent confidence and unconcern he brought a copy of the letter home, and suffered it to fall in Jeanie's way. The girl read it with avidity, asking herself, half proudly, half humbly, Was any of it for her specially ? and only blanching at the mention of challenges and hostile meetings because of one hot-headed young advocate she knew."], [253, "THE TIDE TURNS. 249 During these exciting weeks Jeanie had not dared to broach the subject to Lady Marget, who had been in close attendance on her mother's sick bed, and had not been going into company throughout the winter, so that she might thus have escaped hearing the earlier rumours of the turning of the tide. But she must have known something of the truth later, when Mr. Andrew Douglas went up to London to watch the conducting of the case in the Lords. Yet it might be that the information which reached Lady Marget, coming through Mr. Andrew, would be coloured by the views of him and his party. Mr. Andrew Douglas was a gentle man incapable of deliberate deceit, whatever his agents might have been ; but as he was a mortal man, it was to be thought that, after the trouble some steps he had taken, and the great incon venience which had been incurred by a gentleman of his retired bachelor tastes \u2014 after the bride he had been induced to claim \u2014 and the ruinous costs which were being heaped up by his adversary's appeal to the Lords, Mr. Andrew would be loth indeed to resign his newly gained honours and possessions. Lady Marget was singularly reticent, for her, on what she had heard and what she had not heard, on what she thought now of the shifting chances"], [254, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 250 of her former lover and of her plighted bride groom to Douglas Castle and its dignities. The reserve was a new display of character on the part of Jeanie's friend. Jeanie could only feel full of trembling expectation on the one hand, and on the other of intense commiseration, which found vent in saying to herself a hundred times a day, \" Oh, why could Lady Marget not bide a wee, and bear her family's pressure a little longer ? Who would have said that she would have been weak and other folk strong ? Why was she so rash ? \" , On a raw gusty evening in the beginning of March, Jeanie was surprised by a visit from Lady Marget. Though the season was different, it was so like a visit that she had paid at a former crisis, Jeanie could have shut her eyes and told herself it was all to do over again \u2014 the adverse decision of the Court of Session, the long partings. Lady Marget had walked round, escorted by the factotum Mungo, as she had not done for many a day ; she said, as she threw off her wraps, that she had just come in for a change. She was feeling dowie, and she thought she would be the better of a crack with her cummer, Jeanie. No, the Countess was not worse, she was keeping better steadily now, and had just fallen asleep. The Earl was in his usual health,"], [255, "THE TIDE TURNS. 251 or ill-health. It was only Lady Marget who was a little out of sorts, and had a craving for a friend's company. Her eyes did look clouded, and she was listless and dull, to Jeanie's sorrow. She said nothing in particular, yet she seemed re luctant to go ; she sat bolt upright in her chair, staring into the fire, merely letting fall a word now and then for appearance's sake, as it were : Jeanie did not know what to make of her visitor, whose present mood was oppressive and depress ing to the younger members of the household. Accordingly they dispersed on their own account, after they were tired of staring at sister Jeanie's fine lady friend. They retired to the kitchen to try Eppie Caw and auld Nick with \"fichles\" (riddles), to listen to any stories my lady's Mungie choose to tell, to plague Eppie by inter fering with the tripe-cooking, which she was conducting, in case the master by any chance should come in to supper, or to sit on the kitchen-table for the benefit of her cruizie by which to sew their neglected seams, or read their well-thumbed copies of \"Plutarch's Lives,\" or the \" Gentle Shepherd,\" or a volume of \" Sir Charles Grandison,\" got from the circulating library, which had formerly been Allan Ramsay's. These were the elder and the more studious"], [256, "252 LADY JEAN'S SON. of the troop that occupied so much of Jeanie Erskine's time and thoughts. The younger braved the terrors of the dark stairs and garret bedrooms, in order to play hide-and-seek in the background. Still Lady Marget sat on, like one in a dream, till Mr. Simon Erskine returned, earlier than was usual with him, from his tavern. Out of respect to the head of the house, the scuffling of feet overhead, and on the stairs, and the scarcely suppressed cries of \"Come,\" pronounced for some inscrutable reason, \" Comb,\" with bursts of laughter, ceased. The panting players, to gether with the quieter contingent from the kitchen, appeared for a moment, in forced de corum, on the scene, before being summarily dismissed for the night. At last Lady Marget rose and prepared to go, but her departure was further stayed by the entrance of Eppie Caw, who bounced into the room without her supper-tray, charged with such news that ceremony might well be dispensed with. \" Oh, maister, Mistress Jeanie, Lang Tarn Wabster has just looked in i' the by-going to warn me and Nick and Maister Mungie that there's grand doings at the Cross. A gentleman"], [257, "THE TIDE TURNS. 253 has just arrived in a post-chaise, who has travelled day and nicht frae Lunnon. He's making a speech and reading an announcement to the folk. They're dragging out peats and tar barrels that hae been lying hode, waiting to kindle a bonfire, these five nights ; I trow it's no the King that's dead, and his young son reigning in his stead. His Majesty's no coming doon to Holyrood, nor hae the French landed. It's the Suit \u2014 the Suit that's lost and won.

I lay my command on the laddies that they're not to cross the doorstep. Excuse me, Lady Marget, your serving-man will see you hame. Jeanie, you and Eppie Caw will bide in the house, and keep my supper hot.\""], [258, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 254 \" No, Mr. Erskine,\" cried Lady Marget, restored to life and movement, her cheeks flushed, her limbs quivering, while she laid a detaining hand on his arm, and he had too much reverence for the powers that be, and respect for the quality, to shake her off, as he would have done his daughter. \" Take me and Jeanie with you to the Cross to hear the news. We'll take no scaith under your protection, and we'll be careful that we're not seen.\" \"My dear young lady,\" protested Mr. Simon, \"the Cross is no place for you and Jeanie on a nicht like this. You'll hear the tidings, whatever they may be, before the night is past. I'll rather undertake to send you special word. If you had asked me to see you home, before I repaired to the Cross, though I apprehend your servant is enough escort for the few steps, I would have been, as in duty bound, at your service.\" \"Well, Mungie and Nick may attend Jeanie and me to the Cross, if that is your will, sir,\" insisted Lady Marget, \" if you're feared to have the sole charge of us. I'll be at the ploy, for it is the last of the kind I'll see and hear, since you ken I'm to be married next month, and it does not become a married woman to run after ploys, whatever the fashion may be. When you sit at"], [259, "THE TIDE TURNS. 255 my right hand in my dining-room, you'll not be sorry that you granted the last request I made to you, in the name of Marget Elliot, your daughter Jeanie's friend.\" Sorely against his judgment and inclination, Mr. Simon set forth, burdened with two such unsuitable encumbrances \u2014 Lady Marget tucked under one arm and Jeanie under the other. All Edinburgh was in an uproar, but it was mad with joy and not with rage ; and in the first stages of its joy it was not unlike the appearance it pre sented on a national festival. The bonfire which had been in waiting for the news might have stood for a general illumination. It was already blazing and crackling in defiance of all penalties, at the Cross, and fortunately it was the centre of attraction to the roughest of the population. A post-chaise, its horses yet reeking and trembling with the frantic speed of their last stage, was drawn up by the ancient landmark. In the yellow glare a gentleman, with his head and shoulders thrust out of the open chaise door, was reading, in a loud voice, for the sixth time, the decree of the House of Lords. \" Long live Mr. John Dooglas ! \" shouted the listeners. \" Up with the Lords ! and down with the Court of Session 1 Only no you, Elphinstone"], [260, "256 LADY JEAN'S SON. \u2014 you've focht for the richt like a man ! Hurray for the richt heir ! the bonnie young laud, the son o' the puir dead leddy and auld Sir John, whom the howlets o' judges would have robbed of his lands and name to serve another howlet like their sel's! Young Jock Douglas and his coonsel Elphinstone for ever ! \" Friendly hands were patting the horses' heads, and offering them bags of corn and pails of water procured on the instant. The next moment there was a rush to unyoke the animals and replace them by human substitutes ; a band of resolute men, four deep, supported by double lines of link boys, and followed by a shouting, gesticulating crowd, gathering in numbers as they rolled along, proceeded to drag Davie Elphinstone, in spite of his vehement remonstrance, in triumph to his lodgings. Mr. Simon Erskine had drawn his companions aside into the mouth of a close comparatively deserted. Lady Marget slipped her hand from his arm and went round to his other side, in order to catch Jeanie's hands in hers. Lady Marget's eyes were shining like diamonds, and her head was thrown back till its covering fell on her neck, exposing her face to the imminent risk of discovery."], [261, "THE TIDE TURNS. 257 \" Did you hear them ? Did you see him, Jeanie, and your father standing by ? Are not you proud and glad ? Oh, my dear, I am happy for you ! \" Then as Jeanie hung her head because she could not return the congratulation, Lady Marget hastened to reassure her. \" I am not sorry for myself \u2014 how could you think it ? \" she cried reproachfully. \" I must laugh to-night, though I may greet the morn. My Jock \u2014 he is mine to-night again \u2014 has conquered, as he deserved, and I'm the gladdest woman in the world \u2014 gladder than you, Jeanie, just to know it. He has come off victorious, after all, and I trow my heart sings for his victory. I'm his to-night, let me belong to who will to-morrow. I could find it in my heart to join in the chorus, ' Long live Mr. John Douglas ! ' I'm sure now not his auntie, her Grace of Douglas, nor her Grace of Queensberry, who will neither be to hold nor to bind, wishes him such health and prosperity to wear his honours \u2014 well will he set them \u2014 as I do.\" \"It is the fortune of war,\" said canny Mr. Simon dubiously, \" and least said is soonest mended. We'll away home, my lady, now that you've had your maggot.\" A new idea struck Lady Marget as Mr. Simon R"], [262, "258 LADY JEAN'S SON. Erskine issued cautiously from the close, and placed himself between his two companions. \" Mr. Erskine,\" she said with a little dry laugh, \"you'll never sit at my right hand in the dining room at Douglas Castle ; but maybe you'll come and take pot-luck with me and Mr. Andrew Douglas at ' Douglas Place,' and we'll tell my gude-man how you were so kind as to humour me by convoying me to hear the proclamation of the Lords' decree, at the Cross, and to witness the dragging home in triumph of the lad who travelled post-haste to bring the news.\" When Mr. Erskine and Jeanie had seen Lady Marget safe through the disturbed streets, left her in the hall of Teviotdale House, and made their way back to the Hammermen's Close, they found somebody there before them. It was some body who was thundering at the door as if the house belonged to him. Steady-headed as the young man was, he was \" gane gyte \" for the time. There was not a particle of powder left in his hair, to tone down its fiery red. His cravat was disordered, his ruffles were soiled and torn ; his eyes were blazing, his face flushed. In this guise he looked past Mr. Erskine to his daughter. \"Jeanie, I have come to take my wages,\" he"], [263, "THE TIDE TURNS. 259 cried, and he caught her in his arms and kissed her before her father's face. Then he addressed the dumbfounded Mr. Simon. \" Sir, I make no apology. I've speered your daughter's hand once, twice, thrice before ; I speer it again, and even you will not refuse me to-night.\" \"Well, well, Mr. Davie, you're not blate,\" sub mitted Mr. Simon, not altogether ungraciously. His views had suffered a considerable upheaval within the last hour. He was not disposed to engage, on his door-step at midnight, in a con tention with an intractable, delirious young man. \"We'll see about it; there's time enough. Come in, though it's a thought late, and take a snack, if there's any supper keeping for us, and tell us the news of the decision. What did Wedderburn say? Did Mansfield turn the scales ? \" cried the old lawyer, excitedly. Yes, Mansfield, who maintained the honour of Scotland in the high places of the sister Kingdom ; who had been offered the seals and had refused them ; who was the pride and glory of his grateful country, the soul of common sense not less than of judicial wisdom. Mansfield, worthy brother of Mrs. Jacky Murray, had spoken for an hour on John Douglas's side. Mansfield, whose summings up were so just and"], [264, "260 LADY JEAN'S SON. judicious that they had hardly ever been set aside, had declared in a powerful and convincing speech, that there was practically not an item of proof which could identify either of the missing French children \u2014 whatever might have become of them, with Mr. John Douglas. Lady Jean's artless letters were unanswerable ; through them he saw into her heart \u2014 the heart of a true mother. On the twelfth day of the suit, when the de cision of the Court of Session was reversed, the Lords had sat for an unprecedented length of time, from eleven in the morning till nine at night. That winter's day Lady Queensberry had, in pity for Mr. John Douglas's suspense, carried him off to Kew in her coach to divert his mind. When word of his success reached him, he received it with the same admirable composure that he had maintained throughout the long ordeal to which he had been subjected. \" Oh, he's a wonderful young gentleman ! \" cried Jeanie. \" Is it breeding ? is it grace that has been granted to him ? \" \" It is a pity that all his friends are not equally discreet,\" remarked Mr. Simon Erskine, as a commentary on her words. On that night, again, the windows of every"], [265, "THE TIDE TURNS. 261 judge who had voted against John Douglas's claim in the Court of Session were smashed by the jubilant populace. Lord Auchenleck had not voted with the majority. For a marvel, he and his son Jamie had seen alike. But to the eccentric Jamie, the composure with which his lordship had heard of the Lords' verdict, savoured exas peratingly of indifference. Accordingly, the future biographer of the great Dr. Johnson, not being yet married to his cousin, Miss Peggy Mont gomery, who kept her husband in order, put himself at the head of a section of the mob, and showed them how to demolish the parental panes as a fitting reprisal. On the following day a detachment of troops once more took possession of the streets of Edin burgh, and patrolled them nightly till the public rejoicings were supposed to have subsided."], [266, "CHAPTER XVI. LADY MARGET'S BOND. IT was reported by the news-writers that the expenses of the great Douglas lawsuit amounted to not less than a hundred thousand pounds \u2014 a great sum according to the value of money at the time. To arrange and apportion these costs could not be done in a day. It was summer before Mr. Andrew Douglas, who had been sorely harassed, could bring his trying sojurn in London to an end, and repair to Douglas Place for rest and refreshment. Surely if they were ever to be regained they would be found among familiar sympathetic faces, and old soothing habits, among his books, his house hold accounts, his stables, byres and kennels, and the interesting enterprises in drainage and planting with which he had been occupied and happy before he was persuaded to make the disastrous claim to the estates of his kinsman the late Duke of Douglas. The result had crippled his resources terribly. They would have been worse than"], [267, "LADY MARGET'S BOND. 263 crippled if it had not been for the magnanimity and generosity of Mr. John Douglas. Mr. Andrew Douglas might have had to tarry for the rest of his days amidst the distasteful sights and sounds of such a lodging in the King's Bench as the late Sir John Drummond had philosophically accepted. The pursuer's deliverance had been effected by his late opponent, who had insisted on treating Mr. Andrew as his kinsman \u2014 a kinsman who had been ill-advised in contesting his cousin's rights, but who was no less a Douglas when all was said and done. By this forbearance, therefore, by the discharge on the part of the winner of a portion of the expenses which would have crushed the loser in the suit, by a timely loan, by the sacrifice on Mr. Andrew's part of the savings of his prolonged bachelorhood, and by a mortgage on his property of Douglas Place, he was enabled to return a sadder and a wiser man to his paternal acres. He could cherish a hope \u2014 faint and distant, but still possible \u2014 of yet paying his outstanding debts. Poor Mr. Andrew! He had never greatly coveted the dignities and splendours of Douglas Castle. He had been conscious that he was too far up in years, and of too stiff a nature to change his ways and fit readily into a new regime. He had"], [268, "264 LADY JEAN'S SON. shrunk from encountering it alone, and had sought the only assistance which had occurred to him as proper and practicable. He had felt that even with the help and countenance he had desired, the state and bounty of what had been a ducal estab lishment would have been an irksome burden to him. He had engaged in the contest more from family pride than from lurking vanity. He had entertained a sense that it would be a disgrace to every Douglas in existence to have a wretched French impostor at the head of the house, abusing the power and influence of the old dukes, dwelling in the very Castle itself, which was of as much count as the palace of Holyrood to a true Douglas. It would be a scandal and affront which no gentle man worthy of the name would permit, at whatever cost of peace and ease to himself. It would be difficult to say whether Mr. Andrew now believed in the cousinship which Mr. John Douglas was so ready to profess, when the pro fession, in place of being altogether a gain, involved a loss to him. Certainly Mr. Andrew had been brought to allow that the lad \u2014 whether a veritable Douglas, or a self-deceived adventurer, to whom the highest law-court in the land had, with only four dissentient voices, adjudged the Castle and lands \u2014 had conducted himself like a gentleman"], [269, "LADY MARGET'S BOND. 265 on all the points at issue, and had behaved when the ball was at his feet, in the handsomest manner to his rival. Mr. Andrew had also been compelled to see plainly, through the exposures accomplished in the trial before the Lords, what he had only begun to suspect previously, that his agents, whom he had trusted implicitly, whose integrity he had doggedly declined to question, had been guilty of grossly unfair dealings in his name. Not the least of his ruefulness and mortification was occa sioned by a sense of the aspersions which might justly be cast on his judgment, if not on his honour. Mr. Andrew was heartily sick of the whole affair. He had commenced to believe, in his secret heart, that Mr. John Douglas was the son of Mr. Andrew's beautiful ill-fated cousin, Lady Jean, and her scatter-brain husband, Sir John \u2014 another family connection, who, according to the Lords, had been grievously persecuted and defamed. Mr. Andrew could not be expected to make the admission publicly ; but from the moment the conviction took shape in his mind, he had known that he should have had no rest in having gained his suit, dispossessed the claimant, and taken his place as the heir of the defunct Dukes of Douglas. It was not in mortal man, above all, in mortal"], [270, "266 LADY JEAN'S SON. Scotchman, with his peculiar territorial pride, in addition to other forms of pride, to have reckoned himself and to have been reckoned by his neigh bours for a year and a half the lawful owner of Douglas Castle and its domains, and yet in the end to have to relinquish family grandeur and wealth, and sink into an obscure, impoverished laird, without experiencing a sharp pang. But there were indemnifications. He was so disgusted with the entire business, had been so overwhelmed and alarmed, so fain to clutch at the first respite, that to get back to his quiet home and realize that, burdened as it was, it at least was left to him, that he should no longer have to trouble himself to put on other manners and assume a more dignified bearing, would have been a sensible relief \u2014 but for one consideration. Here was a pretty state of matters for a plighted bridegroom to be plunged into, and that after he had succeeded in outstripping the young fellow who had been doubly the elder man's rival. Mr. Andrew had wooed and won a fair, high-born, high-spirited young bride, with whom he was on the eve of marriage, and what was he to do with her in the altered circumstances ? However great the misconception under which she and her family laboured, when by their advice she broke off her"], [271, "LADY MARGET'S BOND. 267 engagement with John Douglas, and entered into an engagement with Mr. Andrew, though she might bear a grudge against him for the remainder of their unhappy lives, and regard him as the cause alike of her loss of her lover, and of the great match which, as it had turned out he would have been to her, the matter nevertheless stood as has been recorded. And if Mr. Andrew did not propose to fulfil his part of the contract, hugely unsuitable as it had become, like a gentleman and man of honour, he would inflict a fresh injury, possibly the deadliest of all, on Lady Marget. He would place her in the position of a person who had sat between stools and come ignominiously to the ground. The Countess of Teviotdale had shown her toughness of constitution by not dying when she was made aware of the reversal by the House of Lords of the decree of the Court of Session in the Douglas case. The old Earl, too, was still alive. The family had just accomplished their annual transfer to Teviotdale for three months, and on this occasion Lady Marget had succeeded in securing the company of her friend Jeanie Erskine. Lady Marget had represented strongly that it was high time Ailsie Erskine \u2014 who was years older than Jeanie had been when their mother died, and"], [272, "268 LADY JEAN'S SON. Jeanie had to take up the reins of household government \u2014 should be put upon her mettle. It would be like serving a short apprenticeship to Eppie Caw, before Jeanie's marriage to Davie Elphinstone, which was to take place ere the courts began to sit in the autumn. Mr. Erskine had \"come round,\" and consented to the alliance. Ailsie was grown big enough, if she had but wit enough to succeed to her sister. The loon Davie Elphinstone's fortune was made by the conspi cuous part he had played in the great case, which had triumphed in the end, and with Mr. John Douglas, of Douglas Castle, for an indebted and grateful patron. A bird in the hand was worth two in the bush. Mr. Archie Hope's attachment might turn out no better than calf love after all ; and it was doubtful, to say the least, whether the Lord Chief Justice would be propitious where a union between the families was concerned, though an Erskine was as good as a Hope any day. Moreover, Jeanie was a good lassie, and her inclinations ought to be taken into account, pro vided they were reasonable. Lady Marget had said that she and Jeanie might not have another opportunity of spending a summer together, for the rest of their lives. As for Jeanie, she had been willing to give her friend"], [273, "LADY MARGET'S BOND. 269 the consolation she coveted ; though it was an effort to leave Edinburgh when a certain young advocate was again walking the Parliament House, and when, instead of not seeing him once in the season, as had happened sometimes in former years, he might come every day in the character of a privileged wooer to the Hammermen's Close. But if Jeanie had not Davie Elphinstone's presence, she had his letters, which were next best. She could read them over and over again in the bowers and summer-houses which abounded in the grounds of Teviotside ; and she could get through a great deal of tambouring of ruffles, tippets, and aprons, and \"flowering\" of flounces, fit for the providing of the wife of a future judge, in the unwonted leisure and retirement of a visit to the country. Lady Teviotdale was nearly as strong as before her illness, but was fractious and hard to deal with beyond what Jeanie, accustomed to the lordly yet easy rule of her father, could have believed pos sible. The old Earl, too, was manifestly unhappy, and indulged in frequent explosions of temper in connection with his two sons, who were home for the fishing and shooting. They would have been clever and skilful, indeed, if they could have pleased their father in his present mood. Jeanie could not see any great harm in them, if she could not see"], [274, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 270 much good. The elder, the heir, rather overdid \" the powdered beau \" of the period, and the younger \" Robbie \" was inclined to exaggerate the sporting, betting, brawling \" buck,\" who kept the \"beau\" company. The crow which Jeanie had to pluck with them was when they confided to her their disgust that their sister Marget was going to sell her hogs in but a poor market, when all was come and gone. Then, indeed, Jeanie compared them very unfavourably with her laddies in the Hammermen's Close, and doubted whether the young men were worth the price which Lady Marget had thought to pay in order to build up their fortunes. For Lady Marget herself, whatever her temper might have been before she had made up her mind, now that the die was cast, she was cheerful composure itself. She emulated her former lover in self-mastery. Somehow Jeanie distrusted the tight hold which Lady Marget kept upon herself, her words, and looks, after a fashion, quite unlike her natural disposition. Jeanie asked herself, in trepidation, what was despair like, when it chose to put on a smiling face and a laughing voice ? The lines had not been written then which declare that \u2014 \" Like sunshine upon prison bars Is grief behind a smile ; \""], [275, "LADY MARGET'S BOND. 271 but the sense of the poet's words came to the girl as she looked fearfully in Lady Marget's face, worn for her years, but brave and beautiful still. Lady Marget and Jeanie were in a parlour at the back of the old house, in itself more rambling than imposing. This parlour looked out on a rustic, ill-kept bit of the \"policy,\" where there stood a ragged blackthorn hedge, an elder-bush or two, and an occasional broom \" cow.\" Even these objects were very welcome to eyes which had looked long on smoke-begrimed stone and lime. The avenue and the main entrance were on the other side of the house ; but in the country still ness, and in a pause of the girls' conversation, they distinctly heard a carriage drive up. \" There's company when they're not expected,\" said Lady Marget, calmly, though, as she spoke, her colour went and came. In a few minutes a servant, the confidential, conscientious Mungo, in the easy undress in which he had been in the garden helping \"to pull berries,\" entered and made the solemn announce ment \u2014 \" Mr. Aundry Douglas, of Douglas Place, to wait on Lady Marget.\" \"Tell him I'm coming,\" said Lady Marget, briefly."], [276, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 272 When Mungo had retired, she turned with an odd look to Jeanie \u2014 \" My bridegroom ! I cannot say he has ridden post-haste, for I ken he was back from London ten days ago ; but I dare say his joints are stiff, poor old man, and his pulses are languid. He has had a sore down-come and much weary travelling since I saw him last, so that we must make allowances for him.\" She left the room, almost with an unconcerned air, to obey the summons. It was left for Jeanie to wring her hands, and \" greet,\" and thank God that her bridegroom was her own true love, Davie Elphinstone. Mr. Andrew's long back looked longer than ever, though it had certainly lost some of its straightness, and the fingers with which he fumbled to take Lady Marget's hand were tremulous as well as bony. He would have kissed her hand, but she came close to him, rose on tiptoe, and held up her cheek. When Mr. Andrew had saluted it bashfully, she said gently \u2014 \"You've been long away and you've had a thankless errand, but you've come home to rest and be happy. As for the lost honours and diminished means, they are no fault of yours, sir, and believe me, I'll do my best not to mind them."], [277, "LADY MARGET'S BOND. 273 We must just cut our coat according to our cloth.\" \"You are very good, Lady Marget,\" he said, embarrassed as well as grateful. \" But do you think you can bring your mind to what are now my poor circumstances \u2014 to wed an auld carle drowned in debt, instead of the mighty lord of Douglas Castle ? Sit you down on that settee, madam, and think the question over ; count the cost before you answer me. I've thought and better thought what was best for you, as I was bound, without considering myself. But upon my word I cannot tell. You may get both the scaith and the scorn if our contract is not fulfilled ; on the other hand, there may be a chance where you are concerned of bygones being bygones,\" he said somewhat awkwardly. Then he hastened to add, \" There may be a mint of chances for you who are so young, and \u2014 not to fleech you, so bonnie.\" \"But you are fleeching me, Mr. Andrew Douglas,\" asserted Lady Marget from the seat by which he stood, shuffling from one foot to the other, \" and you're speaking to me as if I were a weathercock,\" she said with spirit, while her cheeks were dyed crimson. \"You may have had reason to think me so, but it is not for you to cast it in my teeth.\" s"], [278, "274 LADY JEAN'S SON. \" Cast it in your teeth ! \" exclaimed Mr. Andrew, taken aback ; \" that is far from my thoughts. Poor young lady, you could not help yourself! But now that ill has come of it, I'm loth to stand in the way of your chances, by keeping you to your word that was given in very different circum stances. Therefore I am here to offer you back your troth, if you like to take it. A word of blame shall never pass my lips,\" he finished eagerly. \" I've deserved it,\" she said bitterly, sitting still with her hands crossed in her lap, the fingers tightly interlaced. \" I've deserved to be told what I have not failed to tell myself, that it was no Douglas who ever bore the name I engaged to marry. It was not a man, but a castle, and doubt less a well-plenished dower-house when my day of the castle was over. I promised myself to Douglas Castle, and whenever the castle is out of count, my promise is no better than Samson's green withes. Oh, heavens ! how you are mis taken ! \" she cried passionately, \" and how I slander myself, for I loved the one man as I loved my life, and I vowed, and would have kept the vow, to be a faithful wife to the other, through riches and poverty, good and ill. I have known him all my days, but he cannot trust me sufficiently, to believe"], [279, "LADY MARGETS BOND. 275 that I would have shut myself up to share his mean fortunes and tend his declining years. I would have counted it my greatest pride and pleasure, because I was bound in honour and duty to make up to him for what he had tint and suffered at the hands of another.\" \" Lady Marget, I am greatly beholden,\" stam mered the gentleman, in increasing perturbation. \" You're nothing of the kind ! \" stormed Lady Marget. \" I tell you plainly, Mr. Andrew Douglas, and I'm not ashamed to make the confession that other man was the light of my eyes and the desire of my heart ; but we were parted, as none knows better than yourself, by dire misfortune beyond our control. Now, what is left to me but to keep my word and play my part for him as well as for myself? It was never his will, whatever may have been his hap, to be a cause of ruin to his kinsman ; and I would have done what he would have approved in being a good wife to you.\" \"Madam,\" said Mr. Andrew, driven into a corner, \" I do not doubt your generosity any more than I can question that young man's liberality. Had it not been for him, I would not have seen again the old walls of Douglas Place, the house of my fathers, within which I was born. It does not become me to quarrel with his"], [280, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 276 motives or yours, or to waste another speculation on who were his forbears, since the Lords have taken it upon them to bid that flea stick in the wa' for ever, and to serve him heir to the late Duke of Douglas. Lady Marget, to speak the truth, it was my own deserts and qualifications I misdoubted \u2014 a mowdiewart of an auld bachelor, a poverty-stricken laird whose auld-world, per nickety ways, were formed and set before you were born. We must now add to his other dis advantages the crowning objection of growing near-be-gaun, in spite of himself. What would you have, Lady Marget ? If I had kept Douglas Castle I might have risen to my position, and you would have had a grand downsitting, with the Earl of Teviotdale's daughter, the acknow ledged queen of the country side. But as it is, Douglas Place is little better than a rickle of moss-grown stanes. There has not been a stick of new furniture carried into it, since my father brought home my mother, and that I need not say, was neither to-day nor yesterday. The very grounds,\" \u2014 with an emphatic wave of the hand to the Teviot-side avenue \u2014 \"are no better than a calves' park and a berry garden.\" \" I think you are seeking to put me out of conceit with your establishment, Mr. Andrew"], [281, "LADY MARGET'S BOND. 277 Douglas,\" said Lady Marget, with a new tone coming into her voice, and a new light breaking over her face. \"Surely if the quarters are good enough for you, they should be good enough for me were I to become your wife. The lady cannot complain if she has been made acquaint with the facts, and is only required to fare as the gentleman fares.\" \"But it is second nature to him, Lady Marget\" Mr. Andrew contested the matter desperately. \" He could soon accommodate himself to the worst, if it came ; he would be faring bravely when all her teeth were standing on edge.\" \"Then am I to understand,\" asked Lady Marget, yielding to a sense of amazement, the extent of which was well-nigh comical, while her keen native humour lent a certain relief to the depth of her mortification \u2014 \" am I to understand,\" repeated Lady Marget, \" that you do not wish to have me, sir ? that I have been descending so low as to offer myself to a man who declines the honour ? \" \"Do not put it in that way,\" protested the unhappy Mr. Andrew. \" It is an honour, and would have been a delight if I had been worthy, or the fates had smiled, instead of frowning their darkest. But if you still hold that you would"], [282, "LADY JEAN'S SON. 278 rather wed me, than have the nowt run through your marriage a second time, then with all my heart let us be buckled to-morrow, and whoever else is stinted, I engage that you shall be satisfied.\" \"No, thank you, Mr. Andrew Douglas,\" said Lady Marget, rising and making a low courtsey. \" You are an honest man, and a man of sense, and I was a silly girl. But we are quits, you and he as well as you and I. This is your doing, and I've to thank you for it, while, as far as I can see, there is little likelihood that you will ever repent it.\""], [283, "CHAPTER XVII. \"DOUGLAS, DOUGLAS, TENDER AND TRUE.\" Notwithstanding her words, Lady Marget was a little rueful over the untoward termination of her second engagement \u2014 the more so, perhaps, in the contradictoriness of human nature, because of the elation of the Countess, the satisfaction of the Earl, the all but open rejoicing of Lady Marget's brothers. They did not wish to be hampered with a poor old hare-brained laird, as they thought fit to dub Mr. Andrew, for a brother- in-law and a husband to their beautiful, mettlesome sister. Even Jeanie Erskine could not conceal her gladness ; nay, did not the ex-bridegroom behave as if a weight were lifted off his mind ? Everybody concerned took the affair so coolly that there were neither quarrels nor reproaches. Not only Lady Marget, but all her relations and friends were unanimous in saying that Mr. Andrew Douglas had acted with candour and prudence befitting his years. It was marvellous how"], [284, "280 LADY JEAN'S SON. incontinently he slipped back into the position of an old family friend, and no more, how much he was at ease himself, and made everybody else at ease. He discussed London politics and country interests with the Earl, he gave his views of sport to the young men, he took a dish of tea with the Countess, and acquainted her with the circum stances of such of her friends as he had seen when in town. He was even sufficiently master of himself to describe his visit to Ranelagh for the benefit of the young ladies, and in the course of the description to pay his hearers one or two of his former gallant flourishing compliments. Lady Marget said sarcastically afterwards, she could have shut her eyes and believed that her engagement to Mr. Andrew Douglas had been a dream, so speedily did it vanish into thin air. Finally, Mr. Andrew stayed the night and departed as if nothing had happened, leaving not an arriere pense'e behind him, unless in the dis contented heart of Lady Marget. She was dis contented, restless, and ashamed, even while she did not deny that she was freed from a crush ing obligation. \" But I'll tell you what it is, Jeanie ; I'm left forlorn,\" she confided to her friend. The two girls were sitting together on the"], [285, "TENDER AND TRUE. 281 following afternoon in one of the rustically sentimental arbours which dotted the grounds. Lord Cockburn has described similar grounds belonging to the old Scotch country houses, un walled spaces containing \"peaches and oaks, gravel walks and wildernesses ' grotesque and wild,' a burn, a bowling-green, sun and shade, vegetables, glorious holly-hedges.\" The same eye-witness has explained that in fine weather \"the long smooth lawns of turf, called bowling alleys,\" formed the open-air drawing-rooms of all the old country houses. Lady Marget and Jeanie's bower, composed of dry heather grown over with traveller's-joy, was at the farther end of one of these bowling-alleys. \" I lost my Jock, years \u2014 ages syne,\" proceeded Lady Marget, with sad deliberate conviction. \" He saw the necessity of giving me up, and was more reasonable than ninety-nine out of a hundred suitors would have been. But, as he is mortal man, he will not look over the fact that I was in haste to replace him with his successful rival. Now the tables are turned, and I've lost Mr. Aundry next. He would not suffer me to stand by my word, to renounce this world's vanities, and ' tape out ' what is left of his rents with him. Well, I'll not say that he was not a wise man, for"], [286, "4 282 LADY JEAN'S SON. we cannot tell, without its being tried, how long the fancy would have lasted. But the upshot is that I've gone through the wood and will have to take a crooked stick at e'en, or else do without a stick at all ; and I'm not like you, Jeanie Erskine ; I'm not of the stuff that good auld maids are made of; I'm not cut out for a single lady, even though she be an Earl's daughter \u2014 it is a great come-down.\" \" Hear till her ! \" cried Jeanie, in the height of incredulity and disdain. \" Lady Marget Elliot, Teviotdale's daughter, the first of the Edinburgh belles, with the wale of the best and bravest lads in the country for her marrow \u2014 Lady Marget condemned to be a single lady against her will ! \" With that, before the speech had died away on Jeanie's lips, the tendrils of traveller's-joy hanging down round the mouth of the arbour, were pushed aside, and in the entrance stood John Douglas. He had come with no flourish of trumpets, no coach and six, no post-chaise even driving up the avenue, no herald in the shape of Mungo in his country undress. If a King of Scotland could in his day journey through his kingdom in the unpretending guise of the Laird of Ballingeich, surely Douglas, of Douglas Castle, might, when it pleased him, without any serious impropriety, pass as a gentle man of no particular consideration, instead of the"], [287, "TENDER AND TRUE. 283 man with whose name Scotland, France, and England had been ringing for years. He had chosen to travel by coach, without giving any hint of his identity, as he had travelled when he came down to Scotland in his childhood and found the gates of Douglas Castle closed against him. He had walked from the nearest stage at which the coach stopped, to Teviotside House. He had hit, without entering the house, or seeing any of the family, or servants, on the very spot where Lady Marget was to be found. It might have been by unerring instinct, or it might have been that the girlish voices from the bower at the end of the bowling-alley, had reached farther than the speakers supposed, even as far as a visitor walking up the avenue. Jeanie Erskine did not stop to inquire. She hardly left the newcomer time to raise his three-cornered hat to her, when, mutter- ing something of having forgotten her huswife, she begged her companions to excuse her, and fled like a lapwing to the house. \"And to think, Jock, that I have been the last to wish you joy,\" said Lady Marget, piteously. \" You are wishing it to me now, Marget, when I am learning to the full the sweetness of victory,\" he said lovingly."], [288, "284 LADY JEAN'S SON. \"But can you \u2014 a man, understand what made me fail you, and why it was in me to be false to you in word and deed, though never in heart ?

John Douglas, is it possible that you can understand and forgive ? \" \" Lady Marget,\" he said, \" if I've learnt nothing else in my strange eventful history, I think I've learnt to understand.
