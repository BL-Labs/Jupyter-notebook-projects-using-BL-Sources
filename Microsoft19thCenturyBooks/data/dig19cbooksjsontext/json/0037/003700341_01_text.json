The cause of their contention was their hiring or not hiring the only wet-nurse to be had by them. The chance they were now bandying between them was the last hope for the life of their last child. The time was the final decade in which witches had power \u2014 that is, the final decade in which the belief in witches, with the dogged bigotry and pale terror in the belief, still lingered on Scotch soil. The scene was the"], [12, "8 THE WITCH-WIFE prim, white-wainscoted lady's parlour of a laird's mansion-house of the day, in the low lands of Perthshire. The Laird, in his brown coat and knee breeches, tartan waistcoat, \" Holland \" frills, woollen stockings, and great shoes with silver buckles, was a stalwart man forty years of age, thick-headed and slow-witted. He had strong prejudices, matching his strongly lined, weather beaten face, with its high cheek-bones. He was not over nice in many of his sentiments, and yet there existed in him a rude common-sense and a rough kindliness which balanced his blunders and errors, and kept him manly and well enough liked in his generation. The lady was tall, lean, and pinched, with a high, narrow forehead in the shadow of the voluminous \" borders \" of her lace mutch. She had a thin-lipped, close-shut mouth, suspicious and stubborn, contradicting somewhat her characterless nose, weak chin, and blinking eyes. Her long neck was prematurely wizened for her five-and-thirty years, under her starched muslin neckerchief. Over her sloping shoul ders she wore a shepherd's maud or plaid of dingy black-and-white tartan, drawn tightly round her, till it half hid her cambric apron and black silk gown. The expression of the Laird was wont to be"], [13, "A NURSE TO NURSE THE CHILD 9 full of a certain kind of shrewdness, of a cool, \" canty conceit\" of himself, and of some joviality when joviality was permissible. But at pre sent it was downcast and perplexed. The very sweat-drops hung on his bullet forehead, and his full nether lip twitched as he paced with hasty strides, his tanned hands thrust into his pockets, up and down the narrow bounds of the lady's parlour. In his walk he passed to and fro, always with a covert side glance shot from under his drawn-down bushy eyebrows, at the great chair covered with white dimity, and stuffed with feather pillows, in which the long, spare figure of \" Lady Glenfierroch \" was well nigh swallowed up. An ebony wheel stood near her unused. Wool dyed red was bound about the \"rock,\" and the yarn thread spun from it was also red. It made the one bright spot in the cold white room, with the grey drug get on the floor, and the black and white figure seated in the centre. But when a flicker of March sunshine kindled up the red, it was seen to be dull and faded, like the dying embers ofthe peat fire half quenched into ashes on the hearth. On the broad window-sill stood a pot of balm of Gilead, which ought to have been putting out fresh green leaves, but was yellow and shrivelled from want of water. It had not been intended for a thing of beauty ; it had been meant for"], [14, "THE WITCH-WIFE 10 feeble hands to pluck, and for fluttering nostrils to be refreshed by its pungent scent. Lady Glenfierroch's expression had long ceased to be simpering and complacent. Her very face seemed to have grown inches longer as well as ounces thinner with years and cares. The amount of its dolefulness and querulous ness was only a question of degree under the combined effects of more or less ill-health and family bereavement. The Laird did not wish to be hard on his wife, who had been his free choice fifteen years before, while she offered now to him the baffling, irritating puzzle of a chronic, self-centred invalid in a healthy generation. In fact, she had been for a dozen years a pricking thorn in his side. But, as it happened, she had been only a few weeks ago, as he would have said, \"in the straw,\" at the risk of a well-nigh spent life. She had borne him at the eleventh hour, when hope was all but dead, a late child, a last boy. Poor woman \u2014 it was not her fault, not hers, if she would but be reasonable, that there was no greater promise of life in this lad-bairn than there had been in the other children, each of whom had died at the mother's breast, failing to accomplish a single year's existence. Glenfierroch felt he owed his wife gratitude for the boon in its very precariousness. And"], [15, "A NURSE TO NURSE THE CHILD 11 what man worthy of the name, high or low, in the Carse, would not be willing to yield a por tion of his just rights, in order to humour and \"dawt\" (pet) a woman \u2014 even were she strong, and not \"silly\" \u2014 in the interesting circum stances ? Every man was aware that a newly made mother was a privileged person. Why, even his terrier bitch was cockered and set up when she brought him a litter of puppies. But apart from that consideration, though the Laird, in his blunt, bluff way, had said little about the loss of his children, though his mourning had been of the shyest and shortest, he had shared, so far as such a man could share, his wife's disappointment and desolation over the cradle so often filled and so speedily emptied. He felt as if it were a reproach to him in his man hood and vigour that no child of his \u2014 men children as they had mostly been \u2014 should sur vive to bear his name and hand down the honourable lairdship of Glenfierroch to a suc cessor in the direct line. The Drummonds of Glenfierroch had been hitherto a hale and healthy stock, meeting their deaths more frequently in accidents by flood and field \u2014 in the great hunts which all the country-side engaged in periodically \u2014 in the Duthie River when it was swollen after a thunder-storm \u2014 in the snow drifts when they hid the cart tracks \u2014 in scuffles"], [16, "THE WITCH-WIFE 12 with caterans from the hills, or in gentlemanly sword and pistol fights with the next neigh bours, than in quiet beds with minister and doctor and weeping women waiting to see the end. Why should the exception begin with his offspring ? He was not the person in fault. He was sound in wind and limb. No man of his years could spiel a brae, or break in a wild colt, or go through a bout of sword exercise with less effort and incon venience. The debasing, humiliating weakness was from another source, and surely that source should stretch a point to repair the mischief. \"The bairn is christened,\" he began again tentatively, stopping in his walk to regard his wife's long impassive back, as if that might have spoken in answer to his argument. \" You took care of that, Bell ; he was carried out in the teeth of the east wind, and the rime, into the cauld kirk before three days had passed over the bit bald pow of him.\" \" He was that,\" answered Lady Glenfierroch emphatically. She raised herself, looked round, and spoke with more spirit and determina tion than might have been expected from her languid attitude. \" His bald pow, as you call it, was well protected with a skullcap and a christening-cap, forby a flannel hood.

But we are but a pair of fules to be drawn off into a controversy on baptism when the bairn wants a nurse, and the question is whether Sibbie Bethune is a fit or proper person for the office. I say she is, save for a wheen clashes and lees which have nought to do with the business. She is a clear skinned, strapping cummer as ever lived. Moreover, her bairn which she has lost, poor body, was eildons [the same age] as wee Randal, and there is not another woman in the parish or the Carse precisely so situate.\" All the time he spoke the wife and mother had been writhing in her chair. She hated"], [18, "THE WITCH-WIFE 14 to hear her husband speak of another woman in the terms he had employed about Sibbie Bethune; she detested the necessity for a nurse; she grudged another woman's having a share even so far in her child. It was gall and worm wood to her to have been told by the honest, plain-spoken doctor that the children she had borne and seen die had drunk in poison with their mother's milk, and that if this last child was also suckled by her, he would be seized with the convulsions which had been fatal to his predecessors. She had desired desperately to bring up the child \"by hand,\" and when he was manifestly pining away under the pro cess, and she had been compelled to call in, not Sibbie Bethune, but an undesirable mother in the Cotton (village), to grant the poor infant a respite from the injudicious cares and super stitious practices employed for his benefit, Lady Glenfierroch had made the staring, grin ning woman cover her face with a napkin, in order that the child \u2014 blind as any puppy of his age \u2014 might never recognise his nurse. The ill-chosen words \"clear-skinned\" and \" strapping \" had been an additional offence to the morbid mind of the sick woman who could not claim such attributes. She repeated them with a choke in the thin quaver of her voice. \" Ay, she may be all that ; but have you"], [19, "A NURSE TO NURSE THE CHILD 15 ever sought for the Devil's mark on her braw body ? Would you have that transferred to your innocent bairn ? \u2014 my bairn. Would you have him grow up a warlock, without a shadow, like auld Michael Scott? Would you have him suck in the foul fiend's black nature and his gruesome destiny \u2014 to be condemned to chains and darkness \u2014 till that day (do you hear, Glenfierroch ?), lying helpless on that brazen-faced cutty's breast ? \" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" cried the Laird angrily. \"What has the woman done to you or me or to the country-side that she should be set upon and blackguarded like this ? Her and hers came strangers to these parts. They kept themselves to themselves, and maybe they were a thought wiser and more skilful in their call ing than their accusers.

It may be so, but it is not a very becoming word for a wife to say to her man. And what harm has Sonsie Sibbie done ?

She is a kirk goer, like yourself when you were well. She goes forward to the Tables, and the whole lot of ministers and elders cannot hinder her. There's one who would not hinder her if he could, and that is the Rev. Adam Rattray of the Brigton. He is fair throng [intimate] with Sibbie.

He was not subtle ; he had no casuistry wherewith to answer her.

And after all, what were auld wives' \" freits \" to the welfare of the heir of Glenfierroch ? \" Dang it, woman ! \" he said resentfully, \"have it your own way.

The old woman was evidently a privileged person, and as surely in the height of crossness and exasperation. She was, in fact, Glenfier roch's old nurse, who had been pressed into the service of his last unsatisfactory little son. She deposited the child in the lady's lap with an aggrieved shake and something like violence, which did not, however, still for a second his piteous cry. \" Hae, tak' him yoursel', Leddy Glenfierroch. I can thole his weary girn nae longer. Gi'e him what he wants ; he's for the yird onyway, and as sune dee of pisen as of starvation \u2014 the tae road is shorter and more merciful than the tither.

He's as boss as a toom egg-shell \u2014 and him as weak as water ! If you and Glenfierroch can bide his yammerin', I canna.\" The mother of the child unfolded the flannel with a trembling hand, and disclosed a morsel of humanity, the face yellow rather than red, puckered and drawn, in confirmation of old Elspeth's statement, into the miniature image of an aged man whose buffets with the world had been many and his cares overwhelming. Two little fists were thrust into view, clenched as if in the depth of agony. Lady Glenfierroch looked at her son, and a sudden change came over her own wan, pinched face, as if a rock had been struck and the waters had gushed forth. \" Have your way, Laird,\" she cried passionately. \" Bid them fetch the witch-wife without loss of time. God forgive me if I'm perilling his immortal soul to preserve his perishing body. But a mother's heart is thowless to resist to the death \u2014 not of herself, but of the bairn she has brought forth in sorrow.\""], [25, "21 CHAPTER II \"sonsie sibbie\" Thus summoned, Sonsie Sibbie stood before the tribunal formed by her prospective em ployers. She was, as Glenfierroch had de scribed her, a fine young woman nearing her thirtieth year. She was tall and shapely. Her black dress and white neckerchief, though they were of the plainest description, did not spoil, rather set off, the lines of her figure. She wore a widow's cap, the universal head dress of a widow, whether old or young, in her day. The close coif or cap framed tightly the bands of sandy-brown hair. They were dis posed of with a strong hand, a determined will, and a plentiful application of cold water, still they declined to resign altogether the crisp wave which was natural to them. The com plexion, much freckled and tanned by sun and wind, was originally florid and fair, agreeing with the colour of the hair and of the eye brows and eyelashes belonging to eyes of hazel \u2014 not the warm, red hazel, but the cooler,"], [26, "THE WITCH-WIFE 22 clearer, greenish hazel. The features were large and regular \u2014 a little heavy when at rest ; but when their possessor was interested or ex cited, they were lit up by the spirit within, till their somewhat clumsy mould was lost sight of. Sibbie wore round her neck a string of beads large in the centre, graduating to smaller beads at the two ends of the string. These beads were not of jet, in keeping with her mourning, but of amber. They were such beads as were frequently brought home by sailors from the shores of the Baltic, and worn by all conditions of women in any circumstances. The salient characteristics of Sonsie Sibbie's face and figure, and of her dress, clean and cared for in its evidence of poverty, were those of a robust country-woman gifted with self resource and self-command, which lent her a latent dignity amounting to stateliness. There was another attribute of Sibbie's, and it was that which gave her the by-name of \"Sonsie Sibbie\" which she bore. \"Sonsie\" means well-fleshed, comfortably plump ; and it refers also to the placidity and tranquillity which generally attend on an agreeable roundness of outline and softness of animal texture. Sibbie was not merely \"world and wise like,\" as well favoured as the better looking of her neio-h-"], [27, "SONSIE SIBBIE 23 bours ; there was a curious, simple serenity about her which alternated with flashes of spirit and fire. When the tranquillity was in the ascendant, its effect was to inspire everybody who had to deal with her with ease and confi dence. The peacefulness of her aspect created what might be subsequently regarded as a de lusive impression. Her contemporaries might have pronounced Sonsie Sibbie \" a very decent and discreet looking young woman,\" had it not been for a hostile influence which crossed and contradicted her peacefulness. When she was under the sway of the second element in her nature her neighbours ran the risk of being scandalised witnesses to outbursts of wild merriment and scathing satire. \"Sibbie,\" said the Laird, clearing his throat as if in some difficulty, \" we have heard of your loss, and we feel for you. God knows we ken \u2014 none better \u2014 what it means, and should feel for you, since what are we, after all, but men and women alike travelling between our cradles and our coffins, alike subject to disappointment and heartbreak. Now, we want to ask you, since you've tint your bairn beyond remedy, if you will take our poor wee laddie and do what you can for him.\" He waved his hand to the background, in which Elspeth stood rocking in her ancient arms the flannel bundle she had"], [28, "THE WITCH-WIFE 24 resumed. The moan which issued from it was fainter than it had been, and more like the plaintive bleat of a newly born lamb which has missed its mother, and is ready to die of the cold emptiness of the world into which it has strayed. \"We want to learn,\" broke in Lady Glen fierroch's reedy voice abruptly and not over civilly, \" if you will come up to the house here and nurse the young Laird till I am about again and stronger \u2014 till he has no further need of your services. You will be well housed, and Glen fierroch will pay you what you ask.\" \" An it please you, Lady Glenfierroch, I cannot, though I'm honoured, no doubt, by the proposal,\" answered Sibbie, in her full, some what deep voice. She spoke with decision, but not rudely ; indeed, there was more courtesy in her tone than in that of the lady, and Sibbie's language testified to at least as much education as had been enjoyed by Lady Glenfierroch. There was also a momentary twinkle in the clear, hazel eyes which looked calmly and with out disrespect in the faces of her betters. \"What for no, Sibbie?\" inquired the Laird anxiously, fearing that the ground was about to be cut away from beneath his feet. He had won a battle, only to find himself circumvented. \"It would be the greatest favour you could"], [29, "SONSIE SIBBIE 25 render us. You might save the life of a man to be.\" She looked at him with compassion in her look. \" It is just because there are lives and lots to make or mar, Glenfierroch, that I'm bound to bide still in my own house, where anybody that wants me can find me,\" she told him, with an unconscious dramatic exaggeration of her own importance. \" It is not because of my huswifeskep, though even poor bodies like me,\" with a telling glance at Lady Glenfierroch, \" have their own firesides and their sticks of furniture they prize, and maybe their dog or cat or singing bird and their daily darg [task] they're used to, that they do not care to turn their backs upon lichtly. How do they ken they'll find things and be able to take them up where they left them aff, when they come back? But it's not that, Laird ; I'm not so near be gone [greedy] with selfishness as that comes to. Nor is it because my bairn, the only bairn I'll ever see, was carried out of my house feet foremost three days syne, and laid in the kirk yard with none but me and the grave-digger and Mr. Adam Rattray \u2014 God bless him! \u2014 to see the bit coffin put in the wee hole.

When Sibbie had ended, Lady Glenfierroch crossed her hands in her lap and lay back in her chair with an air of stern reprobation. The look and gesture were not lost on Sibbie, who was a woman, in her placidity, alert and full of observation. Neither did she fail to catch the interpretation which one of her audience put upon her words. It amused rather than offended her. She had been deeply injured, deprived of her good name and de famed. She was an outcast, without having incurred the penalty by personal wrong-doing. God had stripped her of her kindred. But there was one good thing : nobody was left who could be hurt by the aspersions cast upon her, and the very doubtful esteem in which she was held at the best, by the men and women who were willing to profit by her skill and sagacity \u2014 by such a man as Glenfierroch, for instance. She did not blame them. She did not bear malice \u2014 why should she? \u2014 against a pack of fools for their folly. But the treatment"], [31, "SONSIE SIBBIE 27 affected her though she was not aware of it. The iron had entered into her soul and bred a strain of recklessness in her. She had been born to be the contented, capable mistress of a family, a devoted wife and mother, a neigh bourly neighbour. She was left with a spice of the randy in her, the handsome, clever randy breaking out on occasions under the natural dignity * and propriety of her behaviour. Sonsie Sibbie knew that it was not for her real gifts people looked up to and feared her. They put little value on her extraordinary knowledge of herbs and simples derived from her father, who had merited a European repu tation as a herbalist. They were not grateful for her generous use of her knowledge. They were ignorant of that strange, mysterious faculty she could neither name nor understand, of which she was conscious at times with a half-terrified recognition, though she had a man's courage united to a woman's endurance. But it was not for the mystery which was beyond even her fathoming that they pointed their fingers at her and taught their children \u2014 the very children whose ailments she had cured \u2014 to keep away from her and her black dog, 1 Similar dignity or stateliness was noticed and commented on in a woman who was tried and condemned for witchcraft late in the seventeenth century."], [32, "28 THE WITCH-WIFE Tyke. It was for some incredible absurdity of belief that she could ride on a broomstick and fly through the air at midnight, or change her self into a \"corbie\" or a \"cutty\" (a raven or a hare). Sibbie despised the gross, childish superstition. Still, a state of contempt was not her normal frame of seeling any more than a state of resentment. In spite of whatever was strange and abnormal in her mental constitution, her nature was healthy and well balanced. If it ever reeled under a sense of marvels she could not understand, it speedily recovered its equilibrium in a magnanimous good-nature and composure which might be classed as untutored philosophy. So Sonsie Sibbie smiled defiance at Lady Glenfierroch, till the childless widow, in her poverty, realised, by the power of her wide sympathies, the look of affairs to the wife and mother sick to death in her prosperity, and about to have the only child which remained to her snatched from her. Then Sibbie took a step forward and said, with compassionate gentleness, \" Madam, I ken how the pain goes stounding through your head till I feel it in my own brow. If you would suffer me to pass my hand once or twice across your brow, I believe I could lessen the pain if I did not bring you lasting relief.\""], [33, "SONSIE SIBBIE 29 \" Away with you, woman ! I want none of your cantrips,\" forbade Lady Glenfierroch fiercely, shrinking back and flinging out her hands as if to push Sibbie away from her. The would-be physician turned aside with a shake of her high head and her shabby skirts, as if she dismissed all responsibility in this per- verse fellow -creature's preference of suffering to consolation. She would have left the room, but in doing so she had to pass old Elspeth with her light burden. Sibbie's feet became arrested whether she would or not ; she looked wistfully at the mummy of a child, and then turned impulsively to the Laird. \" If you would let me take him with me, Glenfierroch, I would do my best. There would be no hard fare for an infant like him in my cot-house. He would be safe and warm in my arms. He would drink his fill from my breast, where the milk is still flow- ing for him. I would keep him in and out, and watch him day and nicht.

Her mind was beginning to wander, feebly feeling its way into the remote and the unknown. The light of delirium was flickering under the glaze of her sunken eyes.

But Lady Glenfierroch was not disposed either to embrace or bless the lusty child sprawling on the silken coverlet, while she made imperative signs to Glenfierroch and Elspeth, the only persons present, to remove the intruder. However, her mind was not wandering when she gave the direction.

Was the fine lad-bairn not his son, not the poor infant in the dead thraw, which had been transferred from the house of Glen fierroch to the cottage of the Snaws three months since ? When the Laird came to think of it he feared it would be the next thing to a miracle if the pair were one and the same. It would be a terrible disaster if he made a mis take, if a base deception had been practised on him, and he were to introduce a child substi tuted by Sonsie Sibbie, whether her own or the Deil's, for his dead or spirited-away son and heir, to reign in Glenfierroch's stead over his house, his land, and his people. A warlock for a laird of Glenfierroch ! The idea was not"], [42, "38 THE WITCH-WIFE to be entertained for a moment. Did the near approach of death lend the true child's mother more than a mother's instinct to detect the fraud ? The Laird gazed wistfully and fixedly at the three months' babe he had been inclined to cherish and take pride in, as at last a worthy sprout of the Glenfierroch stock. But it might be that its infant sturdiness and comeliness were but a reflection \u2014 after all, plainly to be seen \u2014 of Sonsie Sibbie's vigorous good looks. It was possible \u2014 nay, probable \u2014 that an impudent and wicked attempt was being made to cheat and impose upon the Laird, to cause him to foist upon the whole of the Carse and the shire a being worse than a strange bastard as his own and his poor resisting wife's lawfully born son. Glenfierroch was loath to credit it of Sibbie, for whom, in spite of what he was driven to believe of her knowledge of the Black Art, he had always been disposed to feel considerable respect and regard. He was aware of many acts of humanity and good deeds ill requited which she had performed \u2014 it might be by means ofthe powers of darkness, but surely some merit was due to her for using her uncanny gifts mercifully and kindly.

Glenfierroch ventured to touch the object of suspicion cautiously and gingerly with his blunt forefinger ; a happy movement, for the infant's rosy fingers immediately closed on the father's finger, and to unclose them he had to raise the chubby hand and bring it directly under his notice. He stopped short in his fumbling effort to unfasten the soft clasp, while a flash of satisfaction crossed his troubled face. There before him was a miniature copy of his own broad, short hand, with the crooked little finger which palmists said was a sign of wealth. The sign had not been specially fulfilled in his own case ; but never mind, it testified to what was of more consequence to him at that moment than crowns or pounds.

It was a token, likewise, that she was come of a diligent and careful race, the discretion and good management of whose women-folk, after they became the wives of Highland chiefs, Lowland lairds, and English lords, were not to be surpassed. Sonsie Sibbie's witchery might compass casts of countenance, birth - marks, moles, and the like, but he could not believe that it would attain to such fine distinctions \u2014 personal and family \u2014 as the crook of a finger and the bend of a nail. Glenfierroch seized and tossed up the child in triumph. \"You're my own wee Randy, and no question about it,\" he cried. \" You're no changeling, no Devil's brat, but a braw little man as ever was born. Elspeth Gillespie, my auld friend Elspeth, you mind my father's muckle nose and chin \u2014 I call you to witness it is his gruffer's nose and chin the bairn bears, and no other.\" Thus, though the heir of Glenfierroch missed his mother's blessing, his father acknowledged him without reservation."], [45, "CHAPTER IV THE YOUNG LAIRd's PLAYMATES Lady Glenfierroch had been in her grave for half-a-dozen years. Glenfierroch dwelt alone among his household and retainers. He had no thought of marrying again. Perhaps his first ex periment had not been so successful, in spite of the descent from the kings ofthe Picts, and the patent of unsurpassable matronly prudence, as to warrant a second trial. It had been \"dowie \" (depressing) to have a \"pingin, grainin\" (whim pering, complaining) wife who bore him bairns only to have them \" straiket \" (laid in the atti tude of the dead) as well as swaddled in no time, so that he had all the trouble and none of the pleasure of them. Glenfierroch was a reasonable man. He owned that his lady had not been to blame, either for her delicate health or for the family bereavements, which were sorer on her than on him, so he had borne with her and them as best he could. But when the obligation .\u25a0"], [46, "THE WITCH-WIFE 42 came to an end, he felt the atmosphere was clearer and brisker for him, \"a widow man,\" than it might be if he were to tempt a repeti tion of his experience. He was free to sow and plant and build, to fish and shoot in the seasons, to meet his compeers and cronies at kirk and market, trysts and hunts, comings of age and dergies, and to entertain his company at Glenfierroch without any sense of impro priety or of awkward results. If the state and fare were rougher than of old, if the guests sat long over the dinner-table, and there was no adjournment to the lady's parlour for a dish of chocolate or a glass of home-brewed wine to efface the taste of stronger beverages, at least there was no carping criticism on the protracted sitting to be apprehended. Besides, there was no necessity laid upon the Laird to marry again, as he was thankful to recognise. Bell, his wife, had done him one good turn \u2014 she had in the sequel provided him with as gallant an heir as a man could wish for. Glenfierroch had left the child with Sonsie Sibbie. He had feared what might happen to the child's health if he were withdrawn from his foster-mother's care. He had a man's incapacity for measuring time. He had no near female relative to put at the head of his house in lieu of a second wife and step-mother. Even his own nurse, Elspie, was"], [47, "THE YOUNG LAIRD'S PLAYMATES 43 too far gone in her dotage to be entrusted with so precious a charge. If Glenfierroch was influenced by sundry sly hints dropped by his neighbours \u2014 under provocation \u2014 that it was a wonder the Laird was not frightened to leave his laddie, long after he could see, hear, and speak, in the keeping of a witch-wife, though she was a mettlesome hussy and the child's foster mother, the effect was to harden his will and stiffen his temper. He was not frightened, not he ! at country-side ferlies. Sonsie Sibbie was making a strong man of his \" silly \" (weakly) bairn, whom the child's poor mother, carried away by a woman's jealousy and the frenzy of her condition, had disowned with her last breath. Nevertheless, Glenfierroch consulted alike common-sense and natural affection in paying brief, unannounced visits, at short intervals, in order to judge for himself how Sibbie was fulfilling the trust reposed in her. The Snaws, so named because the cottage lay in a hollow between two braes, where snow was apt to collect and lie in winter, was, as the Laird had reminded his wife, near enough to the mansion-house to be visited easily at all seasons. The situation was lonely, and bleak in autumn and winter ; but on such a May"], [48, "THE WITCH-WIFE 44 morning as that Glenfierroch had chosen on which to make his call of inspection and offer his tribute of affection, the homely place was not without its rustic charm. The wind might have a snell smack in its balminess \u2014 after the fashion of Scotch May winds \u2014 but it was inexpressibly fresh in contrast to the soft, relaxing winds of regions farther south, and could be invigorating to the hardy, healthy children of the soil, like wine of the best bush. There were great patches of gowans like snow itself on the braes, so that even a child's foot could have covered more than the pro verbial nine which under such a cover con stitutes summer. Lambs, dear to the child heart because they are as very children in their innocence and playfulness, were lying, cropping grass demurely, or skipping in sheer senseless joy beside the sedate ewes, whose matted, clingy fleeces were soon to be clipped bare to the pink skin till the very lambs could not tell their stripped and ag grieved dams. The light from the high May sun in the blue sky, across which white clouds were sailing like ships at sea, was of that silvery steeliness which belongs to northern skies. Sibbie's cottage was but a clay biggin' with a thatched roof, and a yard or two of rough garden ground"], [49, "THE YOUNG LAIRD'S PLAYMATES 45 stolen from the wilds, and rudely fenced against intruders ; yet it displayed all the cleanness and neatness which were marked traits in Sibbie's contradictory character. The door step and the flagged path to the little gate were as white as if they had been pipe-clayed ; the pipe-clay having been hearthstone \u2014 in Scotch parlance, \"cawm.\" The small-paned windows glittered like diamonds in the sun shine. The straggling privet hedge was tidily clipped. There was a kailyard behind the cottage for the kail and cabbage, potatoes, turnips, carrots, and onions, which were staple articles of food in Sibbie's rank of life, and for the herbs, not confined to thyme, tansy, and marigolds, but including many rarer, less known medicinal plants which figured in Sib bie's pharmacop\u0153ia. The \" border \" in front of the cottage was for the common flowers Sibbie loved. The small-leaved, prickly rose bushes with their tiny blossoms, the darker, bigger-leaved ordinary white and red rose bushes would not be in flower till July, but here in May were crimson and white and pied daisies, clumps of late primroses, of red and lilac \"Spinks\" (polyanthus), of brown Dusty Miller (auricula), of nodding amber daffodils. If there were such uncanny plants as henbane or deadly nightshade in Sibbie's yard, they"], [50, "46 THE WITCH-WIFE were relegated to the back garden and were not conspicuous even there. \"Hey, Sibbie! take my horse,\" shouted Glenfierroch, without ceremony. Sonsie Sibbie came out in answer to the summons, looking little older than formerly, and as \" decent and discreet \" a woman as ever, in her close widow's cap, her poor but unstained and untorn black gown, her \" lammer beads.\" \" I need not ask you how you're faring, Glenfierroch,\" she said, in a friendly yet perfectly respectful tone. \" You do not need the caller air to set you up. Lairdie is ben there, playing himself as blithe as you like, with his pets. Shall I cry him out, or will you step in ? \" \" I'll find him,\" said the Laird, striding down the narrow path and crossing the threshold, while Sibbie held his riding-horse at the gate. What Glenfierroch saw was a plain and bare, but by no means comfortless cottage interior, swept and garnished, with nothing finer than a coarse coloured print of a ship in full sail above the chimney -piece, and a few specimens of cheap, gaudy foreign earthenware, and of white and pink, and mottled foreign shells. There was the usual box-bed, with the blue and white striped linen curtain looped up in front of it, and the clumsy wooden cradle standing beside"], [51, "THE YOUNG LAIRD'S PLAYMATES 47 it. There were the deal table and chairs, the single cushioned chair covered with the same blue and white linen as was in the bed curtains, the lint-laden wheel, the reel, the kist, the aumrie or cupboard for \" white bread \" or any dainty which was going. A sack of potatoes and one of oatmeal stood in the farther corners of the room, while the peat stack was in an out-house. There were one or two flitches of bacon among the innumerable bunches of dried herbs hanging from the smoke-blackened rafters. The cottage was that of a respectable, tolerably well-to-do working woman, to whom the extremes of squalor and penury were un known. But if Sibbie did serve the Deil, it was clearly not for luxuries of bed and board, unless she could, at will, convert the cottage furniture and fare into the soft couches and dainty food of the rich and great. A glowing peat fire was burning behind the iron fore-face, and between the white \" cheeks \" or jambs which helped to constitute the grate. On a tanned sheep-skin, in the glow, lay a child, big for his age and bonnie, with rosy cheeks and wide-awake eyes, in which, by an effort, one could see again the smaller, dimmer blue orbs of Glenfierroch. The boy was playing with a large black curly-haired dog of the Newfound land breed, then rare in Scotland."], [52, "THE WITCH-WIFE 48 The little lad was clad in a tartan kilt and small coat of fine cloth, and the crumpled frill round his throat was of cambric, like the Laird's frills ; only, while the Laird's were of a some what yellow hue, betraying the absence of a responsible mistress at Glenfierroch, the young Laird's frill was white as Sibbie's mutch and neckerchief, white as the daisies, as the very snow which gave the cot-house its name. So far, well. But what were the pets with which the little man was playing in addition to the towsy Tyke, which half rose to its feet and uttered a thunderous growl at the sight of a stranger ? Round Randy Drummond's fat wrists were glistening scaly bands which clung like bracelets, and yet wriggled slightly and thrust out pointed heads with beady eyes and forked tongues, as if prepared to hiss and dart and inject venom. Hopping on his shoulder, croaking in one of his ears, with a long black beak perilously near the azure eyes, was a hooded crow flapping a broken wing. The Laird stopped aghast ; he had never encountered the trio thus gathered together before, with his son the centre. \" What's this of it, Sibbie ? \" he called out wrathfully, as Randy, still clutching at Tyke, struggled in company with the dog to his feet, shouting jubilantly, \" Daddy, daddy ! \" For"], [53, "THE YOUNG LAIRD'S PLAYMATES 49 the deep pockets of the gentleman, arrested in front of little Randal, had been wont to bring many a whistle and jumping-jack, tin horse and gingerbread crown to the cottage. No such gifts did Glenfierroch bestow on the pre sent occasion. He did not even return his child's greeting, or stoop to caress him, before he turned and tramped out faster than he had entered, to challenge Sonsie Sibbie standing at the gate holding the horse's bridle and feed ing the beast with the child's sugared piece of bannock, which she had snatched up when she obeyed the Laird's summons. The mare, \" Blackfoot,\" was not proof against Sibbie's blandishments. She was pawing with one foot, nickering or neighing, rearing her head, and blowing through her wide nostrils in lively satisfaction and gratitude. \"Sibbie,\" began Glenfierroch, stuttering and choking with the excess of his indignation \u2014 \" woman, is this your care of the bairn ? How dare you surround him with noxious vermin, and teach him to have troke with un chancy beasts and birds ?

I tell you I will have no son of mine making friends with such base clanjamphrey.\" Sibbie, thus taken aback, and violently accused by one she had learnt to look on as a friend, was driven into one of her defiant moods. In her isolation, her intellectual acti vity, and her strong sympathies, she had learnt to know and love all living things high and low within her reach. She was vexed that they should be attacked and aspersed. \" What for no, laird ?\" she demanded with provoking coolness; \"they are more sensible playthings than tin sodgers and wooden cocks and hens. Troth, Randy has a spirit in him which hinders him from looking at lifeless toys when he can get living playthings.

Now, what are bears and eagles but ravenous beasts and birds compared to Randy's wee cattle that are without the sin of cruelty ; not that Tyke will not catch a leveret or an ephesian [pheasant] when he has the chance, but it is for his dinner and mine \u2014 surely a gentleman like you would not grudge us our mouthful, and not for mere pleasure or out of idleset [idle ness].

For the crippled howdie craw, what mischief can it compass? If it had been a corbie, I own there would have been a difference.\" \" But I tell you I will not have it, woman,\" fumed the Laird, far too angry to receive a lesson either in morals or in natural history, or to be converted by it from the rooted antip athies of a lifetime. \" Consider the look of the thing.

What I've lost has not taught me to put away my heart in a gowden kist and steek [close] it with a siller pin, as the song bids. But there, Glenfierroch, take your laddie. It is time he was learning his letters and his carritch [catechism]. You would not have me, a witch-wife, teach him them ? Na, a reverent dominie or a sticket minister is the proper person for that trade.\" \" It is your own wyte, Sibbie,\" said the Laird relentingly, while he recognised the full force of her statement. \" It is time the laddie were at the house being put through his facings, and made to pick up such a bearing and such scholarship as befits his rank and position, from the minister of the parish or such-like. But I would not have had the parting so sudden if"], [57, "THE YOUNG LAIRD'S PLAYMATES 53 you would have listened to reason and done my bidding.\" \" You're wrong there, Laird,\" said Sibbie composedly. \" What must be done had better be gone through at once. Better a finger off than one aye wagging. Partings are not made easier by being long drawn out, like the sough of the winter wind.

You're going to get a ride with daddy on his big horse.\" She hid from the child that he was not to come back to her, and he shouted in unclouded delight, \" A ride with daddy ! Gee up ! gee up ! \" imitating the ploughmen's invocation to their cart-horses. Glenfierroch took a step towards his son and then hesitated, his heart reproaching him for his harshly prompt acceptance of Sibbie's suggestion. Tyke put his shaggy paw into the balance and weighed it down on the wrong side. At that step of the Laird's towards the child the dog sprang forward with a savage growl. Glenfierroch, kicking the animal aside, seized the boy, whose toilet was completed. \" Get out of my way, you hellicat brute ! \" he roared. Next he called back to Sibbie as he made for the door, \" 111 send you what wage is owing.\""], [58, "THE WITCH-WIFE 54 \" No more wage, Glenfierroch,\" Sibbie cried after him. \" I've had more than enough already.

You must loup upon my bed and guard me, and keep me warm. You must mind me that you were Jock's dog and kenned him, a privilege that even Randy did not possess, though I have telled the bairn, young as he is \u2014 and he liked well to hear \u2014 how my man went and came on his voyages, how he sailed the seas in calm and in storm, and how his braw ship he was so proud of was driven a wreck on the reef, when all on board perished, one waefu' night before his bairn was born.\" Her thoughts wandered far away for a season. When they returned to the present, she told herself the Laird would be sorry for what he had done on the spur ofthe moment ; she under stood him better than he understood himself. The act would not be recalled ; both he and she saw that it was no longer desirable. But he would send the young Laird to see her some times ; and she would take care that the father should not be bribed nor the son tempted\u2014 either by the final banishment of her humble satellites, or by the bairn's being brought into fresh con tact with them in the brotherhood which St. Francis was fain to proclaim. Sibbie was uneasy on one point. She had done nothing to the child beyond discharging"], [60, "56 THE WITCH-WIFE the duties of a capable and kind nurse ; but she could not conceal from herself that, young as the bairn was, he was not quite like other bairns. It was not in his love for the lower animals, for that did not go further than the fondness which familiarity might develop in any child. He had derived something else from Sibbie without her will, against her will. She was convinced that she had detected in the little lad the dawning of these occult and mys terious faculties which she could not analyse or classify in herself, but which she was aware were there holding her apart from ordinary humanity. \" They'll swear I've bewitched him if they ever find out,\" reflected Sibbie ruefully. \" Will Randy turn against me with the lave because I've made him wiser than his kind? Dear kens ! Yet I had no hand in it \u2014 none whatever. I would never have ventured on such an undertaking, not where my own bairn was concerned, and he might have had by descent the power which has gone unwarranted, unsought, to the other.\" Sibbie pondered a little longer in wonder, doubt, and awe, in regret lit up with irresistible flashes of triumph. The Laird had taken back his son, as he was entitled to do, and he might not spare him to Sibbie even for the occasional condescending visit which any foster-child"], [61, "THE YOUNG LAIRD'S PLAYMATES 57 might pay to his foster-mother. But it could never be said that Sonsie Sibbie had \" neither art nor part\" in Randy Drummond. He had drawn from her in their close contact what she had not offered, what in her better moods she would have withheld, what could not, in the nature of things, be expelled with not a sur viving trace to show what had been."], [62, "CHAPTER V \"BONNIE BABIE OF BALDUTHIE \" Balduthie was a small place compared to Glenfierroch. It was merely what in Scotland is sometimes called a \" pendicle \" of land, only sufficient to constitute its owner a \"cock\" or \"bonnet\" laird. However, it had a better class, old-fashioned tower of a house upon the land, such as gentlefolks, whether lairds or tacksmen, could dwell in. The present occupants were Drummonds. For that matter, everybody was a Drummond in that locality unless he happened to be a Murray, or a Menzies, or an Oliphant. The Balduthie Drummonds were doubtless an off shoot of the Glenfierroch stock, as they in their turn claimed descent from a cadet of the noble house of Perth. The Drummonds of Balduthie were repre sented at the present time by a household of elderly warriors who had fought both by land and sea. There was Major Drummond, the eldest. The small patrimony naturally 58"], [63, "BONNIE BABIE OF BALDUTHIE 59 belonged to him, but he gave his brothers house-room and a share in all which concerned their birthplace. He had served in campaign after campaign in the Low Countries. There was Lieutenant Drummond, who had taken arms under Montrose, and been engaged on the winning side at Tippermuir and Inver lochy, and on the losing side at Philiphaugh. And there was Commodore Drummond, who had swept the high seas with victorious Blake. Not more than one of these worthy gentlemen, and he the Lieutenant, had married, while he had been for many years a childless widower. But the gentler sex was not altogether lacking at Balduthie. The only sister of the warriors had married a Drummond cousin. She had died young, and her husband had followed in her footsteps. But the couple had left behind them one child \u2014 a daughter, Babie Drummond, to be brought up by her uncles, and to become in time their housekeeper. Little of the spoils of war had come to Balduthie. Each veteran was poorer than the other. They could barely subsist on their combined savings and the scanty profits of the pendicle of Balduthie. But they were well-born, gallant gentlemen, who held their heads high, and made a very respectable ap pearance, in their faded buff coats and blue"], [64, "60 THE WITCH-WIFE jackets, their well-preserved uniform, at kirk and market. They were not without their compensations and enjoyments. They had succeeded in coming home to die in peace among old scenes and old friends. At the same time, the ancient warriors fought their battles over again to interested listeners, by the fireside in winter, and on the garden bench in summer. The Major farmed the few fields, marshalling his ploughmen, \"halflins,\" herds, and field workers, who helped to hoe his tur nips, reap his corn, and gather his potatoes, with military authority and precision. He ranged his black cattle and sheep into bat talions, and sent the collies in brisk sallies to preserve the ranks. The Lieutenant appropriated the garden as his charge, and cultivated vegetables, fruit, and flowers, all the year round, on the most approved principles then known. The Commodore was in his element on the lochan, an appendage of the property. He was not content with a boat on its waters ; he built and rigged a miniature schooner which traversed it from end to end, and was the admiration of the whole country-side. Neither did he disdain the burn of the Duthie, which, though it was but a big burn, contained salmon-grilse and trout in abundance. He"], [65, "BONNIE BABIE OF BALDUTHIE 61 kept the footpaths along the low-lying banks, and by the wooded scaurs which overhung it, in good order, and boasted that by his dredging \u2014 when dredging was proper \u2014 the Duthie was navigable to small boats for a greater stretch of water-way than was its more important, brawling rival, the Fierroch, into whose arms the Duthie at last subsided. The warriors' niece was as the apple ofthe eye of all the three, and she could twist the fiercest of them round her little finger if she chose. They had combined to educate and spoil her. The Major had taught her a little campaign French, German, and Flemish, in addition to the lessons in English, writing, and arithmetic, which the nearest dominie had given her. He had also drilled her, and made her walk in step with her head up and her toes out. The Lieutenant entrusted her, from her earliest years, with a small spade, rake, and basket, and accepted her willing assistance in the lighter work of the garden. He had a musical ear, and could play both on the viol and clarionet, so that he was possessed of sufficient knowledge to instruct her how to accompany her voice on her mother's little Irish or Highland harp. The Commodore instructed his niece in rowing and steering a boat, and in under-"], [66, "THE WITCH-WIFE 62 standing and applying correctly the nautical terms in use on board a frigate. Babie at seventeen and a half was so bonnie in her snood or in her hood, with her crop of dancing dark curls, her merry eyes as black as sloes, and the poppy red in her brown cheeks, that her bonnieness was proverbial. She was known as \" Bonnie Babie of Bal duthie \" throughout the Carse. Yet her bon nieness was only the fresh, saucy sweetness of girlhood, of a flower in the bud. In time, possibly when trouble as well as happiness had developed and ripened her whole being as frost helps to ripen grain, the bud might open out into the perfect flower. It was only the bud of promise as yet, which is good simply as a stage to further progress. It would be a bad day for both Babie and her admirers if they grew so enamoured of the bud that they would fain stop its growth and keep it in its immaturity, not desiring that it should arrive at flower and fruit. For a bud must grow old like everything else in creation, and there is nothing so dreary to contemplate, so foolishly incomplete and effete, as a washed out, shrivelled-up old bud which has been pre vented from blowing in its season, and has never fulfilled, either spiritually or physically, the end for which it was created."], [67, "BONNIE BABIE OF BALDUTHIE 63 Babie, being still in the bud, was, partly by reason of her age, partly from the force of cir cumstances, half bairnly, half womanly. She was bairnly because of her limited experience, and because she had been brought up in a household of elderly men who doted on her, magnifying her merits and finding excuses for her shortcomings. There was never a woman among them to initiate her in the delicate mysteries of a woman's heart and life, to call her to order, and rebuke her for her childish forwardness, or thoughtless negligence where the claims of others were concerned, or her dan gerous, unbecoming rashness and recklessness in her own small affairs. Poor bonnie Babie ! There was not a woman, whether married or single, with a mother's heart in her to teach the lass -bairn dainty maidenliness and fine discretion. The loss did not originate in the warrior uncles having no female friends among their old acquaintances. The chief reason was that the Carse happened then to be thinly peopled with resident gentry, and that there was no lady \u2014 maiden, wife, or widow \u2014 at Glenfierroch, the nearest laird's house, and in a sense the natural head of Balduthie, and its guide in what belonged to manners and deportment. Moreover, from not having been accustomed"], [68, "THE WITCH-WIFE 64 betimes to just and judicious criticism ol their little niece's behaviour, the Major, the Lieu tenant, and the Commodore, in their excess of pride in her and tenderness for her, had grown to be stupidly jealous of any hostile opinion ex pressed on a single act of hers, and to attribute it to envy and malice. Babie's womanliness, of which she had her share, was not therefore derived from any sister-woman, not even from the minister's lady at the manse. She was the daughter of a professional man in Edinburgh, and had come north late in life with a high idea of the culture of the capital, together with the precedence it ought to give her in a com paratively rude country circle. But the sparse lairds' wives and daughters, however unlettered, stood out stubbornly on their longer pedigrees and higher social standing, declining to ac knowledge the superiority of the capital in the person of the minister's wife, and mocking at her mincing gentility. Accordingly, she was induced by lack of encouragement to betake herself to the good deed of giving Babie some instruction in plain sewing and embroidery, in the finer cookery and the distilling of cordials and simples, accomplishments absolutely essen tial to gentlewomen in those days. Unfortu nately, the minister's lady could go no further, for, in spite of her self-complacency, she was"], [69, "BONNIE BABIE OF BALDUTHIE 65 unable to cope with and control the darling of these three elderly men in her youthful arrogance and intolerance of restraint. Babie's womanliness was derived entirely from the fact of her premature acquaintance with the straitness of her uncles' means and the corresponding restrictions of the house hold, combined with her sense of responsibility in the matter. She had a proud conviction that she was the warriors' natural stay in their domestic concerns ; that she, and she alone, could look after and take care of these three benighted, bald, and grey-headed men. It did not signify in her eyes that they had made their own way from boyhood. The least travelled of them had been all over Scotland in sunshine and under a cloud, blazoning a hero's victories, or lying in hiding with a cause in ruins, and a chief beheaded at the market cross of Edinburgh. As for the Major, he had traversed much of Holland, France, and Germany ; while the Commodore had not confined himself to the English Channel or the German Ocean, but had been as far as the Spanish main. All the three had faced dangers innumerable and survived hardships beyond telling, only to come under the yoke of their young niece, Babie, and to be, accord ing to her artless conviction, unable to do E"], [70, "66 THE WITCH-WIFE without her. No doubt this confident belief helped Babie to become womanly, though it also added to her childish self-conceit. Life at Balduthie was at this stage when the young Laird of Glenfierroch began to appear there with suspicious frequency, especially when there was any new fashion in curled periwigs, plumed hats, slashed coats, or hanging sleeves, to be flaunted before eyes which pretended not to see them. Young Randal Drummond was always volunteering uncalled-for escorts of the three gentlemen and their niece to kirk and market. He was always encounter ing and attaching himself to them when they went at intervals soberly junketing to the burgh town, or attended social gatherings at wappenshaws, or golf or curling matches, or games of bowls or quoits \u2014 anywhere at which Glenfierroch Drummonds and Balduthie Drum monds could forgather. There was only one Drummond master at Glenfierroch by this date. The young Laird was still young, but he was also the Laird in possession. His father had been a strong, able bodied man, little past three-score \u2014 not only when he was last seen carrying off his bairn from Sonsie Sibbie's cot-house of the Snaws, but after his boy had attained young manhood. The elder Glenfierroch had, notwithstanding,"], [71, "BONNIE BABIE OF BALDUTHIE 67 passed away, as gossips said, like the flicker of a candle. He had stayed late at a justices' meeting. The night was foggy and rimy ; the cold air caught him by the bull neck and the broad chest. First a chill, then an in flammation, and last a fever of a malignant type, of which he died in less than a week. Young Randal Drummond, Sonsie Sibbie's \" Lairdie,\" was now absolute monarch at Glen fierroch. He was entirely his own master, which might be the reason why, in addition to his perpetual encountering of his nearest neighbours, he dropped in so often of an evening at Balduthie to talk farming with the Major and gardening with the Lieutenant, the prospects of the salmon fishing or the last news of \" our ships \" with the Commodore ; to play cards for silver groats with the three gentlemen, and \" the tod and the lamb brod \" (the fox and the lamb board) for love with Babie. In the last case, whatever he might say or do, he was teased, found fault with, laughed at and scolded, and generally badly treated, to the scandal of the uncles, by the slim, half-grown-up upstart and tyrant who had arrogated to herself the precedence over the family circle and the mistresship of the household. Certainly, if either the late Glenfierroch or"], [72, "68 THE WITCH-WIFE his lady had been in the body, they would have had something to say against this inti mate association of the bigger Laird of Glen fierroch and the cock Laird of Balduthie, though he and his brothers were gallant warriors. Randy's father and mother would have looked higher in a match for their son, as did every ally he had ; but the young man took the bit between his teeth, for so young men will. On the other side, the Major, the Lieu tenant, and the Commodore pricked their ears and looked knowingly at each other, though they were gentlemen and would not broach the subject even among themselves in plain terms. They would not say to each other, unless on strong provocation, \" Glenfierroch is getting daft about our Babie, and that is what brings him here day by day without an invitation ; we're not such auld fules as not to see through a mill-stone. An offer from him sounds grand. Glenfierroch will be a fine down-sitting for our sister's daughter.\" But they coughed a little significantly when they were alone together, and one would say slyly to the other, \" Did you say, Major \" (they were punctilious in giving each other their respective titles), \"Glenfierroch was telling you when you met him at the cross-roads that he would may-"], [73, "BONNIE BABIE OF BALDUTHIE 69 be take a daunder over before supper ?

He keeps us canty with his visits ; he's fine company for a raw callant.\" \" He's more than that,\" one of the others would comment jealously. \" He was of age when his father died, and that is more than a year syne. It will soon be time he were settled in life. Glenfierroch must needs be a lonesome home for a young man, whilk is no doubt the reason its master is so often abroad.\" When similar remarks happened to be over heard by Babie, she would break into the con versation, tossing her curly head, and declaring, \"I'm sure I wish he were settled down, nailed to his chimney-corner, or tied to some manag ing wife's apron-string. He's a coos to trail here, where he might see he is not wanted. He might be more thought of if he made him self scarce. As for me, I'm sick tired of his stammering speeches and his blate laughter.\" \"Call canny, Babie; call canny,\" remon strated an uncle gently, but with manifest anxiety. \" He's a worthy youth, Glenfierroch, a clansman and a neighbour, the best of neigh-"], [74, "THE WITCH-WIFE 70 bours. We must be neighbourly in our turn ; no lady or gentleman is forgetful of the claims of hospitality.\" \" The claims of hospitality ! \" echoed Babie in a high key. \" What have they got to do with our being weary of a menseless [mannerless] intruder ? We would not refuse him bite or sup in extremity ; but as to his taking offence at our just letting fall a civil hint that a little of his absence might be better than so much of his company \u2014 well, I'm sure I'm easy whether my lord takes the dorts [sulks] or mounts his high horse and does not come near us for twelve months to come \u2014 a good riddance ! \" ended Babie scorn fully, stepping out of the room that she might not be further taken to task by her indulgent elders. \"The lassie will surely never be such a gowk [goose],\" cried one of the uncles in alarm, when the provocation was thus given. \" Let her a-be,\" pronounced the Lieutenant, who, having married in his youth, was sup posed to have knowledge of women and their ways. \"She'll come the sooner round. Give her her fling and she'll not be long of tiring of her capers,\" he said confidently, with some dim and distant memory of his own wooing. \" It is just that she is a young thing full of"], [75, "BONNIE BABIE OF BALDUTHIE 71 flouts.

These three were : a long pedigree, a territorial possession, and pedagogic learning \u2014 if united with godly religion, so much the more precious. Randy Drummond had two of these unap proachable qualifications, and he was a good, dutiful, reverent lad besides. Of the warriors, the widowed Lieutenant was not only the man of the greatest experience in one light, he was the brother of the softest mould. He had complacently referred to Randy Drum mond as a likely young man to take a girl's fancy, a fit match for Babie. But had he been stiff with rheumatism, and whiter headed than his father was when he vacated his laird ship in favour of Randy, even the Lieutenant would have thought young Babie \"daft\" to refuse the anticipated offer. Glenfierroch was such a good down-sitting ; to wed with the higher branch of the clan, such an unquestion able honour. Little Babie would reign as a potent matron among those very neighbourly matrons who had shown their neighbourliness by taking it upon them to turn up their noses and find fault with the bairn. She would be the young queen of the country-side yet."], [77, "73 CHAPTER VI glenfierroch's danger There was a bad King on the throne \u2014 the pleasantest and most faithless of men. Early adversity had taught him nothing save to con- sult his inclinations and \" jouk and let the jaw gae by \" (duck and let the unsavoury torrent pass). He had broken every pledge he had taken when he came to his kingdom. He cared nothing for the credit or independence of the country. He was an utter sceptic where honour, duty, virtue, and religion were con- cerned. His immorality, his renunciation of every solemn obligation binding on him, his light-mindedness and ingratitude caused his name to stink in the nostrils of his Scotch sub jects. There was no love lost between them. He had too little earnestness in his careless good-nature to take the trouble to be vindictive. It was not in him to be ungracious, but the least gracious shrug he gave his easy-going shoulders was at the remembrance of Scotland, where he did penance, wore a long face, swore"], [78, "THE WITCH-WIFE 74 to keep the Covenant, and listened, or affected to listen, to endless sermons of which his short comings frequently formed the texts. This King's heir was his brother, who had sat in the high court of justice, and seen with stolid relish the thumb-screws and the boot applied to testifiers for the truth, men of whom the world was not worthy. This tender-hearted prince was suspected of black popery, so that little was hoped for from the successor to the throne. England was restive, concerting patriotic plots, and planning Protestant insurrections. If Scotland was more quiescent, it was simply because she was more cautious and was biding her time. Still, there were premature move ments, secret assemblies, projected risings among more than the west-country Whigs \u2014 abortive and doomed to be nipped in the bud because the hour and the man were not ripe for revolution. These hasty, frustrated attempts, when made on the borders of the Highlands, had from time immemorial been conducted under the guise of great hunts, inaugurated by powerful north country noblemen or chiefs, to which their fellows in rank and their humbler neighbours were summoned as if for purposes of sport, while higher game than deer and ptarmigan"], [79, "GLENFIERROCH'S DANGER 75 were in the leaders' minds, and fire and sword directed against the Government and its allies lurked under the talk of \"cutty-guns\" and salmon-spears. None of the warrior brothers of Balduthie had any concern with a certain Earl's hunt, though they were patriotic lovers of their country, and stanch adherents of its kirk. They had all served the King, and his father before him, and were King's men in conse quence. Loyalty demanded it of them, as they held. They would render unto C\u00e6sar the things which were C\u00e6sar's. They would not utter a despiteful word ; they would not suffer themselves to harbour a censorious thought against C\u00e6sar, because they had taken his pay, and had worn and still wore his livery. It was theirs to obey their sovereign \u2014 not to sit in judgment on him. The Commodore went further. He main tained that the Duke of York was an excellent sailor, and so must be a worthy and able man, fit to steer the helm of a country's government when he should succeed his most gracious majesty King Charles. The Commodore had nearly plunged into a hot quarrel with Glen fierroch on the subject the last time the young Laird quartered himself on Balduthie. For Randy Drummond was only shy and timid in"], [80, "76 THE WITCH-WIFE Babie's presence ; out of it he was neither back ward nor fearful. Like many another gene rous, enthusiastic young soul, not disposed to look before he leapt, he was all for freedom and honour, the vindication and preservation ofa reformed political constitution. He would assert the people's rights, their liberty to wor ship God according to the light of conscience. They should manage their worldly affairs with out being king or priest ridden, impoverished by unlawful taxes and royal monopolies, or saddled with overbearing ecclesiastics in restored cathe drals and fraternities of cowled and frocked monks, from whom John Knox had set Scot land free. The subject of Glenfierroch's seditious opinions and his perilous sympathy with the disaffected, together with the probability of his being drawn in to join this make-believe hunt, was being anxiously discussed in spoken cipher over the breakfast-table at Balduthie. What would become of their niece Babie's grand down - sitting if the young Laird was slain in what was no more than a rebellious foray, or if he was included in the general out lawry of the mischievous plotters and traitors who were proposing to bring, needlessly and recklessly, cruel war and bloodshed into a peace ful country? What if his lands \u2014 fine corn-"], [81, "GLENFIERROCH'S DANGER 77 land and pasture-land, as well as moor-land \u2014 not to say his head, were forfeited. More over, these elderly clansmen of Glenfierroch's liked the lad for himself. The very loyalty which was the prevailing element in their common nature caused them to suffer by proxy for his folly, and to long to rescue him who was in a fashion their feudal head and superior, because of his belonging to a higher and older branch of the Drummonds, one a step or two nearer to Perth than the Balduthie brothers were. The breakfast -table at Balduthie was an example of a provision for different tastes at the morning meal. The house did not possess a dining-room or a lady's parlour. It had only a hall or living-room, furnished with solid oak, and embellished with the Major, the Lieu tenant, and the Commodore's swords and pistols disposed above the chimney -piece, in addition to a few antlered heads of deer, foxes' brushes, and the dried skins of otters and wild cats fastened on the walls. Babie's bower consisted of the deep embra sure of one of the windows. It was large enough to hold Babie, her wheel, her work basket, and her harp. The Lieutenant had nailed up some old tapestry as hangings, which she could draw and undraw. They sheltered"], [82, "THE WITCH-WIFE 78 her from shrewish draughts, and kept her pri vate at will. Babie herself decorated her window corner with May boughs, branches of holly with its red berries, or of willows with their yellow catkins, with clusters of roses and sheaves of lavender-spikes, in their respective seasons. There was no thought of anything so woman ish and childish as flowers on the hall table \u2014 at the foot of which the eldest serving-woman, supported by the more privileged of the farm servants, sat at the evening meal when the work of the day was over. The exception was on oak-apple day, when oak boughs were to be seen everywhere. The Major, accustomed to campaign diet in the Low Countries, broke his fast on slices of corned beef between barley bannocks, and a great jug of the strong-brewed ale which re placed the red Burgundy and the pale amber of the Rhenish, even the royal purple of the Bour deaux, which was beginning to be scarce in Scotland. The Lieutenant had a wooden cog (basin) and bicker (drinking cup), and Babie a smaller coggie and bicker of porridge and milk. The Commodore drank his allowance of grog out of a curious tall Dutch glass, and munched ship's biscuits to bear the liquor company."], [83, "GLENFIERROCH'S DANGER 79 The gentlemen, as they ate, exchanged brief, measured remarks on a danger in the wind, together with mysterious allusions to a rash, ill-advised \" birkie \" (youth), whom it might concern. They came no nearer to the facts of the case ; they mentioned no names, because they did not wish to fright the bairn Babie. They had a settled conviction that all serious questions of politics and warfare were beyond a woman's, especially a girl's, comprehension, and clean out of her sphere. All the time Babie was pricking her ears as she balanced her horn spoon (silver was for high days and holidays) and darted glances out of the corners of her bright eyes from one uncle to another. She perfectly realised the subject and person under discussion, and made the disdainful mental comment that he would be a coos (coward), indeed, if he did not go his own way and risk what danger was going. The proposed hunt, with the Laird's attitude towards it, was a matter of concern to the war riors at Balduthie ; but it was a question of life and death at the cot-house of the Snaws in its rural obscurity, with nothing save the doubtful, uncanny character of its mistress to lend it distinction. Sonsie Sibbie had continued to love the lad,"], [84, "80 THE WITCH-WIFE whom as an infant she had taken in place of her own child, with a passionate attachment far beyond the mere lingering fondness with which foster-mothers regard their foster-chil dren. The connection between the two had never been wholly severed. Randy Drum mond, whether as boy or lad, had retained a tenacious affection for the woman who had saved his life, and cherished him as she would have cherished her own flesh and blood during his first years. He was without a mother to whom to carry his small troubles. He was necessarily left much by his father to the care of a succession of tutors, young men studying at Aberdeen, St. Andrews, or Edinburgh, in the winter months, and doing their best to shift for a living and make up a purse during the months which remained of the year. The servants liked and looked up to the young Laird ; but they never quite forgot that he had been the witch-wife's charge, and that the lady, his mother, had been convinced he was changed in his cradle. Bonnie, spirited boy and fine young man as he undoubtedly was, there were certain aspects in which he differed from other boys and lads. He had moods and ways, drowsy, dreamy moods and erratic ways, with sudden, sharp awakenings and displays of unaccount-"], [85, "GLENFIERROCH'S DANGER 81 able knowledge and power, which could only be explained by his having, young as he was, a share in his unchancy nurse's gruesome gifts, and by his possessing, whether he ever used it or not, a capacity for dabbling in the Black Art. Certainly he flew to Sonsie Sibbie in all his difficulties. More than once he had defied the authority of tutor and father and run off to his early refuge. Had it not been for Sibbie herself, who brought or sent him back without loss of time, and put severe checks on his visits, there would have been serious mischief wrought. When Randy was the laird and master of the situation, he insisted in a masterful spirit on making a sensible difference in Sibbie's worldly condition, since, whether or not ill gotten gear came to her, she did not spend it on creature comforts. Her spare means went for a superior pestle and mortar and an ex pensive still with which she might concoct her drugs. She bought rare books written by no more dubious authors than learned herbalists like her father, who had taught her the Latin names of plants.

He was not to be an alien and outcast from his kind because of endowments beyond those which were ordinarily vouchsafed to the race. For this, as for other considerations, Sibbie was greatly troubled by the discovery that the Laird was meddling or \" melling \" with the coming Hunt.

Sibbie satisfied herself of the folly underlying the so-called \"Earl's Hunt\" and of the dis asters which awaited it, in the manner which was open to her. She had some acquaintance with the confidential soldier - servant of the King's General stationed with his force at Perth to keep the Highland border in due subjection. The man sometimes came to her under the rose, to seek relief from a St. Vitus ailment which threatened to disqualify him for ser vice. She had overcome the malady, and earned his gratitude, coupled with wholesome awe. He had judged himself bewitched, and concluded that it was by counter spells she had undone the witchcraft. He was obliged to her, but the obligation was plentifully seasoned with distrust and apprehension. However, he owed her a debt, which he had the unwonted grace to recognise that no amount of Scotch pound notes could have altogether repaid. She sent for him to the Snaws, on the excuse of giving him additional directions how to ward off any further attack of his ailment. He came obedi ently but unwillingly.

When the man came to himself, waking up from his sleep, he had forgotten all he had said or done beyond an uncomfortable conscious ness that Sonsie Sibbie had turned him inside out. But the witch-wife was reassuring : she bade him go his ways and take heart of grace ; he was a serviceable loon and no harm would be fall him. Sibbie let no grass grow beneath her feet before she waylaid Glenfierroch in one of his rides and besought him, \" Laird, you will have nought to do with this 'Earl's Hunt' that everybody is speaking about.

Sibbie, like many a real mother who puts the price of her son as far above rubies, thought few women good enough for Glenfierroch. She would have regarded any one of Perth's daughters as not demeaning herself by throwing down the handkerchief for Randy Drummond to pick up. He would have been well worthy of her, Sibbie would have held up her head and roundly asserted in one of the rare weaknesses of which she was guilty. It had been a mortification to her, as to Glenfierroch's other friends, to find that he was going a-wooing to Balduthie after a young lass who had nothing to recommend her save a gipsy face, a sharp tongue, and a reputation of being spoilt \"to the mast-head\" by three donnert (doting) auld soldiers and sailors.

But, however disappointed and aggrieved Sibbie might feel on account of the Laird's infatuation, she stood aloof and let it run its course. She employed no arts lawful or un lawful, used none of the spells or philtres which were attributed to her, to prevent the misfor tune which was impending. She was at once too sagacious and too honest to be guilty of unwarranted interference. She knew that here she could do nothing. She knew also that, even if it had been in her power, she would not, in justice to Glenfierroch and the girl she disliked, meddle between them. Glenfierroch was entitled to his choice of a wife, however unfortunate that choice might be. In like manner, the girl was entitled to her chance of a husband, however undeserved that chance might be.

Babie was inclined to think of her, in the light of a girl's sharp young wit and youthful in tolerance, as a cool-headed, barefaced impostor, who made gain out of her neighbours' ignorant superstitions and cowardly terrors. It vexed Babie to think that the Laird of Glenfierroch should have been indebted to such a person, even in his irresponsible infancy, or that he should maintain the connection of foster-child to foster-mother. If ever she, Babie \u2014 but here she broke off her sentence with a toss of her curly head, and substituted for it the vague declaration that it would never be with her will that anybody in whom she took an interest should have the slightest traffic with a witch wife. The nearest to an absolute quarrel which Babie had had with Glenfierroch was when she twitted him with his sneaking kind ness for Sonsie Sibbie, and expressed in no measured terms her own opinion of the witch wife. Then Glenfierroch faced her and said plainly, Sonsie Sibbie had been the best friend of his youth, and turned on his heel, showing himself too hurt to be at once propi tiated by the combined efforts of the warriors, turned peacemakers for the nonce."], [100, "96 THE WITCH-WIFE These were Babie's sentiments in broad daylight and in conversation with her lover and her uncles ; but in her corner, when the gloaming drew a misty veil over all familiar objects and made them look strange and spectral to her, or in her little room on her bed in the dark night, her conclusion sustained considerable modification. She was neither more enlightened nor less sceptical than were her contemporaries. There was the witch of Endor. There were the Scripture warnings against having anything to do with witches or witchcraft. There were the learned and godly ministers of the Gospel who believed devoutly in witches as in everything else in holy writ. Nay, they consented to hold solemn sederunts in which wretched women accused of having traffic with the Devil and all bad spirits were tried and condemned. Not so often as in former years, yet not infrequently, tales cropped up in this parish or in that of the \" prickers,\" who were the accredited officers of Church and State, having detected on some miserable body the infallible mark that its owner was in bondage to the powers of darkness.

Well did he know what would be his payment if any of \" the offisher gentlemen \" or the servants caught him invading the pre cincts of Balduthie.

It was early autumn. The hips and haws were reddening in the hedges, the clusters of rowan-berries were hanging in bunches of coral above the brown water of the Duthie, the flush of pink ling on the uplands was replacing the purple bell-heather, growing sere and rusty like the bracken. The little three-cornered fields of bere, of a pale butter colour, were ripe for shearing ; while the blue green of the strips of oats had not been transformed into the golden sheaves of harvest, which was late in these regions. But though the harvest still tarried, it was the sportsmen's month. The hunters' moon was rising in the sky, the birds were strong on the wing, the stags' antlers were full grown. It was the fast-approaching season for that great gathering to hunt the wild creatures of the deer-forest, the moors, the glens, and the rivers, of which so much had been heard. Soon the"], [104, "THE WITCH-WIFE 100 frosts and snows of winter, misty days and long moonless nights, would render impassable the \"gates\" (passes) into the fastnesses of the everlasting hills. When the sun was low in the sky Babie resolutely tied on her white hood, drew the mittens on her plump brown hands to make her look older and more dignified, and sallied forth, telling herself she would get rid of the audacious trespasser on her good-nature and be back before her uncles' supper-time. Although it was barely five o'clock the sha dows were already beginning to stretch long and dark across the path through the fir wood. It felt lonesome and eerie, notwithstanding the day had been bright, and the sun was still shin ing when Babie came out from the trees and left the carpet of last year's fir spikes behind her. She saw that Sonsie Sibbie, in her widow's dress, had arrived before her. Beside the witch-wife was a large black dog, old and stiff, its eyes filmed with the blue glaze of age, its ears no longer pricked up to catch the sounds, which were fast dying into silence, where the dog was concerned. One of Sibbie's strong brown hands, the left one, on which the wedding-ring grown thin, and as it were welded by long use into the flesh of the third finger, was turned in the dog's crisp curls ; the other"], [105, "SONSIE SIBBIE'S TRYST 101 grasped the shattered bar of the gate.

It was a stateliness which Babie, though she might mince and bridle in her self-conscious youth, and step sedately with quiet or brisk matronly steps in her more mature years, could never rival. It was the first time Babie had been brought face to face with the witch-wife, and when the girl saw the woman inadvertently looking down upon her from Sibbie's superior stature, and taking Babie's limited measure from head to foot, from her outer dress to her inmost thoughts, with those cool green hazel eyes of hers, a responsive yet resentful thrill ran through the girl. What was coming over her ? She strove to pull herself together, to preserve the scornful indifference and haughty wonder at the situation in which she found herself, that she had determined on previously as her line of action. But strive as she might she could not restrain a falter in her voice when she took the initiative and made the condescending but disdainful speech she had prepared to utter : \"Well, good woman, what is your will with me ?

Would she preside over his house at Glenfierroch and chase away the moods which baffled him, before the year was out? \" Glenfierroch,\" said Babie suddenly, break ing in on his agitated thoughts, \"what is this about the great Hunt you're to join in next week, or is it to be in a fortnight's time ? \" She bent her head still lower and did not"], [113, "BABIE TESTS HER POWER 109 look up at him as she spoke, but her needle rested idly in her hand while she tarried for his answer. He glowed with pleasure at any expression on her part of interest in his actions. \"Oh ! is it the Hunt you're thinking of,\" he cried eagerly. \"It is going to be a big affair. We're to scour the country, and maybe take a turn across the Grampians.\" He was proceeding to recount the details of the expedition with much animation and some eloquence, for he was only blate and silent when Babie sat upon him and re pressed him with flouts and snubs and in tolerable mirthful raillery, which made him feel ridiculous, and tempted him to gnash his teeth with mortification, promising himself that he would never speak another word to the saucy little jade, only to find himself again in her presence, yielding to her yoke, glum and sore. He was prepared now to supply her gladly with a list of the company which was to attend the Hunt, and to ex patiate on their projected exploits in riding and racing, mountain -climbing, deer-stalking, together with shooting and spearing every bird, beast, and fish which came in their way, from an eagle to a sparrow-hawk, from a stag of ten to a fox-cub. But never a word of civil"], [114, "THE WITCH-WIFE 110 war, of men struggling in deadly conflict with their brother- men, of rapine and slaughter, of blazing roof-trees, houses left desolate, in which a few hours before husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and servants, had dwelt in peace and security. In fact, as he spoke to Babie he half forgot the ulterior nature of the Hunt, and saw in it only the blithe, manly sport he was describing. She interrupted the flow of his words. \" And what is to be the upshot of the ad venture ? What is to be the spoil of the harrying of the wilds ? \" she asked abruptly and dryly. \"Why, Mistress Babie,\" he reminded her in astonishment, \" have I not been telling you of the heaps of game we're to gather in ? We'll need all the carts in the country-side to bring it back. And though there were no game to show for our trouble,\" he added, with a flash of recollection, \" would you have us sitting in the ingle neuk, counting our fingers, or turning the auld wives' wheels, instead of breasting the wind and the wet, the hail and the snow, if there are any going, spieling the braes, swimming the rivers and the lochs, just for the pleasure of the thing, because we are men and must do our work and our play like men.

That is the game you're after, sir ; and do you think I want a share of the misery, whether in the infliction or in the suffering ? \" He was standing beside her, erect and proud. \" Who set you on to beard me like this, Mis tress Babie?\" he asked hotly.

It was ill done of them, though I say it in your hearing.\" \" They did nothing of the kind,\" denied Babie stoutly. \" The true meaning of your Hunt never passed their lips to me, though they had wit enough to see through your feigning.\" As the couple spoke they looked involun tarily at the group of men by the fire.

Were the two on the eve of appeal ing to their seniors to ask the consent which the young people might take for granted, and to crave the elders' blessing ? Randy Drummond shrugged his shoulders impatiently. \" I must be at the bottom of this business, and this is not the place to go into it,\" he muttered. \" There are too many within sight and hearing. No offence, madam,\" in answer to an indignant gesture of Babie's ; \" your friends are my friends, but I could spare their presence for a space. The secrets and the safety of others are not mine to jeopardise, or I might risk my own poor concerns.\" Then he raised his voice, and said in loud tones which might reach even the Lieutenant, who was slightly dull of hearing, \" Mistress Babie, the rime has not begun to fall, and the day has not shortened to the extent that there are not ten minutes of gloaming to spare.

But you'll take no harm, Mis tress Babie, from a single turn in the garden before the moon rises or the stars come out.\" The conclave by the fire did not affect not to hear. They nodded energetic approval, for this request of Glenfierroch's was entirely in order, and what might have been expected. They even cried, \"Go with the Laird, Babie, and show him the jargonelles and the pippins, and be sure you point out to him the Siberian crab, which is bearing fruit for the first time, though it was set six years syne.\" Was not this the clinching of the excellent bargain ? Were they, Babie's guardians and nearest relations, to stand on ceremony and raise an artificial barrier between the lassie and her braw wooer, as if they were so many \"mim-mou'ed\" (prudishly particular) fine ladies?

It was Babie who hesitated in momentary uncertainty. Randy Drummond had never used a masterful tone to her before. She would not say that it did not become him better than trembling before her anger, and wincing under the lash of her tongue. But what sort of precedent would she establish if she obeyed the first wag of his finger ? Only she had to admit that she had given him cause for stealing a march upon her. She was forced to own that if a lass is so rash as to meddle in a young man's private matters, and that to his face, she must pay the penalty. She must de scend a step from her pedestal, and grant him the satisfaction of an explanation if he should seek it.

A wild, scattered-brained girl who served in the dairy, helped to feed the calves and wean the lambs, went on errands, and did odd jobs about the place, laid a wager with the more youthful and thoughtless of the rustic circle that she would slip out, hide among the raspberry bushes, and find out if the wedding-day was 1 The bride and bridegroom's gifts to the relatives, friends, and retainers of the couple."], [121, "BABIE TESTS HER POWER 117 fixed.

They always received it as an honourable acknowledgment of their merits and services on the part of a senior officer. The demonstration demanded in return the most courteous reception and the exercise of the utmost hospitality. It seemed that after all, General Kingscote had sufficient spare time on his hands to pay his customary visit to Balduthie this autumn, for, contrary to expecta tion, and against express information, the Earl's Hunt, which had excited so much speculation, turned out to be an ordinary hunt of the kind, not over well attended, not extending to any great distance, and not remarkably fruitful in 126"], [131, "BABIE UNDER SUSPICION 127 big game. In fact, the Hunt was brought to a summary conclusion by unexpected engage ments which the leaders found they had to fulfil elsewhere. The General felt himself fooled and balked of his lawful prey. It was easy to see that the warning intelligence which had aroused the King's officer to action in anticipation, had not been confined to one side. There had been at least two at the trade. Intimation that the plot had been forestalled and circumvented had been communicated to the gentlemen who were to have conducted the Hunt, in time for them to remove from it every element that could be viewed as treasonable or subversive of the King's authority. General Kingscote was furious. He insti tuted searching inquiries in order to discover who had been the spy and the telltale in his camp. It was on this errand that he came to Balduthie, and his greeting was stiffer than usual as he alighted from his horse, in his military cloak, long riding-boots, and jingling spurs, and was conducted into the hall with much civil attention by the Major, the only representative of the brothers who happened to be at home. \" I wish a word with you, Major Drummond, before partaking of the refreshments such as"], [132, "128 THE WITCH-WIFE I see your servants setting out.

General Kingscote was his junior in years, but his senior in rank by the couple of steps he stood above the Major, and by the active service in which he was still engaged. All this should have rendered Kingscote the more careful and considerate of the feelings of a gentleman in the Major's position. \"The fact is,\" explained the General, thaw ing a little at the hurt and offended attitude at once assumed by the man who was an old acquaintance for whom his guest had a genuine respect, \" I am in a strait.

He had lived under military discipline, and a military requisition was a law to him. He was willing to make any reasonable concession. Still, the two officers erected their necks within the stiff coat - collars which the flowing cravats only served to hide, straightened the gentlemen's long backs within their long-waisted coats, and shook the curls of the wearers' peri wigs at each other \u2014 not unlike two dignified turkey-cocks consenting to a truce, but on the verge of renewing active warfare at any moment. Kingscote's next words were calculated to amaze but hardly to disarm his adversary. \"If I am not much mistaken, you have a niece, Major Drummond ; indeed,\" feeling that polite ness called for a more elaborate and courteous allusion to Babie, \" I believe that I have had the pleasure of being presented to the young"], [138, "THE WITCH-WIFE 134 lady, and of being indebted to her good offices as the mistress of your house.\" \"Doubtless,\" answered the Major, divided between surprise and uneasy displeasure. \" Your former visits were of another descrip tion; and as my niece, Mistress Babie Drum mond, is at the head of our poor household, I trust she was never wanting in the cares and attentions which were due to one \u2014 with regard to whom she was under the mistaken impression that he was the friend of her uncles.\" \"Man,\" cried the General, suddenly break ing out, \" keep your temper, and bear with me, as I am bearing with you.

He would discover from her if, after all, the General had been misinformed. Or her uncle would induce her, if she was the culprit, to tell from where she had derived her unaccountable familiarity with the tactics of the commander of the Royal forces. In that case the Major would report to the General the guilty insti gator who had been at the bottom of the check to his proceedings.

But as for the"], [143, "BABIE UNDER SUSPICION 139 General, he was subdued into a state of puzzled thoughtfulness and dawning dismay.

Babie was in the kitchen, as imposing a room as the hall itself; for, in addition to its firwood tables and birchwood chairs, it was fur nished and garnished \u2014 in spite of the warriors' lack of \"the penny siller\" \u2014 with homely, ap petising trophies, not of the chase, but of the ancestral farm.

On the shelves were ranged the Lieutenant's apples and pears, while bundles of dried fish from the east coast, and bags of onions and pot herbs, hung on the rough walls. Babie had been left in charge by the old woman who ruled over the kitchen ; she had been called away to preside at a birth in one of the cluster of cottages a quarter of a mile off. Babie was in the act of \"putting out\" \u2014 that is, kneading, rolling with a rolling - pin, and spreading on the iron griddle on the top of the peat fire a baking of oaten cakes for house hold use. She was full of gleeful importance, determined to do herself credit in the task she had appropriated. Her sleeves were turned up, exposing her round white arms ; a great sacken apron or \"brat\" enveloped her slender figure. Her brown face was flushed, and her curly hair, escaping from its riband, was straying in so many vagrant elf locks. Under the burden of her responsibility, and the effort she was making to complete her work in triumph before \" Tibbie \" should re turn, she formed a picture of young woman liness and domesticity as far removed as possible from a complicity with political ma chinations and a culpable attempt to thwart"], [146, "THE WITCH-WIFE 142 the lawful purpose of the King's soldiers.

The implication came too near the truth. It was through a woman who was believed to practise the Black Art, and was known as \"the witch-wife,\" that Babie had received the message on which, in her igno rance, she had at the time set no great store. Notwithstanding, as a precaution to keep herself guiltless of harm which might befall Glenfierroch and others, she had taken the tale to him. But if witchcraft was at the bottom of the revelation, and if the witchcraft was suspected, did it not behove her all the more to keep her own counsel ? If the blame were cast on her, as the Major had affirmed, if any thought that she was the witch should ever occur to those who reckoned themselves injured by her story, would not her position and the loyal characters of her uncles serve to shield her? Would not her youth, and the point that she had committed the offence in the interest of Glenfierroch, to whom all the world said she was next thing to troth plighted, be accepted as an excuse for her ?

Who would care that she had been Glenfierroch's foster-mother and had saved his life, as he was wont to plead in justification of his regard for her. But was it for Babie to compass her de struction ? Only Babie, Glenfierroch, and Sibbie were acquainted with the quarter from which Babie had derived her information. The \"little bird\" which had been so busy gathering up and conveying to the King's party what had passed between Babie and Glenfierroch in the gloaming garden of Bal duthie, had failed to be present, and to re cord the details of the previous interview between Babie and Sibbie in the sunset at the side of the fir plantation, by the broken gate which led nowhere. While Babie stood mute before her uncle, the side issues of a tragedy were being enacted in the familiar kitchen of Balduthie, in the homely neighbourhood of the baking of oat cakes with their single and double \"nickies,\" about which their maker had discoursed blithely to the Major on his entrance on the scene. \" Oh ! do you not see, Major, that I cannot"], [153, "BABIE IN PERIL 149 tell you what you want to ken, without break ing faith with whoever telled me what was likely to be the upshot of the Hunt?\" Babie said at last, in piteous desperation. \" I would not disobey you ; I have never done it, even in play, since you and my other uncles came back from the wars and took me, a poor, forlorn, orphan bairn to rear and cherish. But to break faith was never a lesson which you or the Commodore or the Lieutenant learned me ; you are honourable gentlemen, true to your word and your colours \u2014 you would not begin to learn me disloyalty now ? \" The Major did not curse her ; he let his hands fall and turned his back. He did not even condemn her in so many words for her misinterpretation of his lessons and her con tumacious opposition to his will. He was too dazed by all that had happened, and by finding the child whom he had supposed to be as wax in his hands, a woman with a woman's tender conscience, capable of being like stub born iron in resisting him. The Commodore and the Lieutenant, when the Major told them of the trouble which had come to the family through their niece Babie, saw the matter in the same bewildered, per turbed light. They were equally perplexed and dum founded : perplexed as to where"], [154, "THE WITCH-WIFE 150 Babie could have heard beforehand what was to take place between the hunting party and the soldiers ; dumfounded that their niece, their petted bairn, their clever young housekeeper, should decline to satisfy them as to what she had been about, should in a manner defy their authority to question and control her. They had given her the length of her tether ; they had spoilt her to the top of her bent ; they had relished, and not curbed, her airs of supre macy and her pretence of ruling them. And now, when she had turned the power they had bestowed on her against them, had acted for herself and would not be ruled by them, they were filled with astonishment and con sternation. They were as abashed as Babie was. Not one of the men in the height of their confusion, at their wits' end how to clear her, believed for a moment that their little Babie, their sister's daughter, the child they had known from her infancy, was a witch in forbidden communication with familiar spirits, the powers of darkness, the black Deil him self.

She had brought"], [155, "BABIE IN PERIL 151 herself and them under suspicion and into disgrace. They had a sense of outraged pro prietorship and wounded affection. The Major and the Commodore showed it by heavy dis pleasure against the offender ; they turned a cold shoulder to her ; they rebuffed her in every timid attempt she made to approach and propitiate them. The Lieutenant was of gentler mould. He knew more of \"the weeping blood in woman's breast.\" There always hung about him a lingering, subdued memory of the young wife he had lost and mourned faithfully. He could not be hard on Babie, even though her behaviour had been incomprehensible and was perverse to the last degree. He could only summon her into the garden to help him to pluck and store the remaining fruit, as if nothing had happened. He could only look down at her with wistful appeal as she picked up the apples which fell from the trees he was stripping, or held up her apron for the spoil from the hazel-nut bushes. Once he ventured to say \u2014 not desiring to push her to extremity, or to drive her to speak against her solemnly taken resolution \u2014 \" Babie, can you not tell me? \" \"No, Lieutenant,\" was the sorrowful answer. \"I cannot \u2014 I cannot break trust; and where"], [156, "THE WITCH-WIFE 152 would be the good of transferring to your shoulders, which are a thought bowed with rheumatism, a burden which my young back does not find it easy to bear?

A terrible bruit began to sound in muttered thunder in the parish and the Carse. The news that young Mistress Babie Drummond was the individual who had known beforehand what was to happen, and by warning her lover had put a stop to the Earl's Hunt in its com promising features, spread far and wide with manifold additions. The gossip enjoyed from the first \u2014 thanks to the forwardness and folly of \"Bletherin\" Kate \u2014 an extensive cir culation.

She was but a young, bonnie lassie, but women as young, as bonnie, as gently born, had sold themselves to \"Sawtan\" before it came to her turn. \" Done for the sake of her young lover ? \" quo' they.

Her uncles put no barriers in the way of his seeking to hear the truth from Babie, though he had a dim perception that their proud and happy hopes for her had been suffered to fall into abeyance. Indeed, if he had known it, the Major, the Commodore, and the Lieutenant felt it was for them to come to an explanation with Glenfierroch, to tell him the strange dilemma Babie had got her self and them into, and her unpardonable reti cence in refusing to confess to them where she had got her knowledge.

Better that, however, than that the whole household, and she the foolish, froward lassie in especial, should rest under a disgraceful imputation. She did tell him the first time they were alone together, partly because he was so far behind the scenes and could understand her story. Still more because of her girlish sense of being forsaken and abandoned, left to stand by herself in her trouble \u2014 she who had been the young mistress of the situation, deferred to, praised and petted for everything she said and did, for every responsibility she took upon her without the warrant of years and ex perience.

None, not even her uncles, would dare to plague and vex her after she had given him, Randy Drummond, the right to stand between her and the world. In the keen joy of accepted and returned love, which had been denied to him for a time, it is to be feared that Glenfierroch forgot his foster-mother and what he owed to her. He did not have his bliss clouded by the realisation that in order to set matters straight for Babie and reinstate her in public opinion, if that were possible, he must ex pose Sonsie Sibbie to deadly danger by denouncing her as the original author of the tale which had been brought to him.

It was his hand, her \" Lairdie's \" hand, which was to drag her down to such earthly per dition as awaited a reputed witch here, and was a faint foreshadowing of her eternal con demnation hereafter.

It would be useless for her to plead strange faculties and occult gifts, of which he had a shuddering intuition, when she was carried before the Presbytery. It was a cheerless day in late October. The little hollow among the hills, bleak even on a midsummer day, was indescrib ably bleaker when there were no tall white gowans and yellow weebies (ragwort) strewing rainbow silver and gold in the pasture ; when there were no lambs on the uplands, no larks in the sky, and Sibbie's flower-border pre sented dead flowers and bare earth, when winter seemed to be paying a premonitory L"], [166, "THE WITCH-WIFE 162 visit to the north. A chill, shrill wind was whistling through the dank, desolate air, and sweeping before it withered blades of grass and bracken, which early frosts had whitened and rendered rusty and shrivelled. Glen fierroch was affected by the season and the sky. He was quickly impressed by the aspects and moods of nature, while ashamed of his impressionability as of something lack ing in manliness. In his generation ordinary men were not affected with such sensibilities ; they were the characteristics of fops and milksops. He was gloomy as the day when he rode up to the gate, dismounted, and fastened his bridle to the post. But it was not only the wail of the wind, together with the sudden consciousness of the position in which Sibbie might be placed, which tugged at his heart ; young love in its absorption is hard and egotistical to all save one object of devotion. Glenfierroch's mind had re verted to his suffering mistress \u2014 his now by her own sweet consent \u2014 and it was in a gust of rage at Sibbie for having exposed Babie to censure and danger that he entered the cottage. What right had Sonsie Sibbie to drag Mistress Babie into the scrape, and leave her in the lurch to bear the brunt \u2014 his bright young lass, who had never till now"], [167, "LET HER ACCUSE ME, MY BIRKIE 163 known contradiction and trouble ? There was no use in pretending it was on his account. What did it signify for him ? He would have died a dozen deaths sooner than have cost Babie a single sigh. Short-sighted, ungracious man ! Had not Babie's strait brought her fluttering to his side, from which she would never depart ? Was he not able to guess, by this hour of the day, that one death on his part \u2014 there was no need for a dozen deaths \u2014 would have drawn from Babie not merely a sigh of per turbation and alarm, but salt tears, which long years would fail to dry ? \" What made you meddle unbidden in my affairs, Sibbie ? Who sent you to Mistress Babie of Balduthie ? \" he cried, in his un reasonable resentment. \"Who told you to send her to me ? Are you aware that you've got her into a sorry plight ? \" Sonsie Sibbie had risen from her seat by the hearth with a glow of mother's delight at the sight of him, but his words smote her as with a sharp blow, and raised the spirit of contradiction in her.

He turned back and sat down heavily with a frown on his brow, but a quiver ofhis lips. \"No, Sibbie, you do not understand,\" he assured her, speaking more calmly. \"You fail to do her justice. She has not turned upon you, as I have threatened to do. She would not black you. She has kept your secret, in my absence, to her own loss and sorrow.\" Sibbie came and stood before him, looking searchingly and incredulously into his face. \"What! that prideful, set-up, little besom.

Then her defiant mood took possession of her again. \"Man, I'm not a woman ; I'm a witch-wife,\" she said mockingly. \" Do you accuse me your self, then, Randy Drummond ?

There above the chimney-piece was the rude-coloured print of the ship in which Sibbie's man had sailed. It had been the greatest treat of his childhood to be held up to inspect its tall masts, slim spars, white sails, and the mazarine blue water on which it was supposed to sail. There was the heavy wooden cradle in which he had been rocked, still in the place of honour. There was the auld dog Tyke snoozling round Glen fierroch's feet, and wagging its wavy tail with all the vigour left to the animal. Randy Drum mond's other toys and playmates had gone the way of all living things, or they had been transferred to the back settlements provided for them. Only the broken-winged crow still flapped the wing which remained to him, and peered down with an inquisitive eye and a questioning croak from his wicker cage on the shutter. Randy had caused rough shutters to be made, and had himself fitted them in their place, to guard against draughts when Sibbie was laid down with her attack of rheumatism. He had sent over a stock of tanned deer-skins"], [172, "168 THE WITCH-WIFE and sheep-skins to put before her bed and her chair. Sibbie's good housewifeship, with her scrupulous cleanliness and tidiness, had made her cottage of the Snaws, with its new accom paniments, look, as she had said, \" bien and couthie \" in its degree. The fire cast a cheer ful and warm light round the hearth and the grannie's chair from which Sibbie had risen. O In addition to the can of Glenfierroch butter, the Glenfierroch kebbock, and jug of Glen fierroch ale, set out on the well-scoured table, were the glittering pewter plate with barley bannocks, which tore like rags in the hand, the newly poured pot of potatoes hung on the crook to steam, and the herring taken out of the salt to \"buff\" or brander before the fire, sending an appetising aroma through the houseplace in anticipation of Sibbie's supper. \" I cannot bear it,\" cried Glenfierroch hoarsely. \"I'm in a sore strait, and you who used to be my friend, to whom I was wont to come to tell my troubles and get gude advice from, are helping me no longer. In stead, you're driving me to desperation.\" He started to his feet, caught up the hat he had thrown down, and left without a further word of leave-taking. Presently his horse's hoofs were heard clattering along the uneven cart-track. Sibbie did not offer to stop him, neither"], [173, "LET HER ACCUSE ME, MY BIRKIE 169 did she follow him. She stood looking sorrow fully at the place where he had been. She spoke aloud to herself, as women who lead solitary lives will do. \" Puir lad ! his heart is riven in twain, and that is a heavy dis pensation. And so the little prideful quean who gave herself airs, and pretended not to care, would not tell upon me, would rather bear the ill sough and the fierce storm which might follow ! Even if it did not come, the word of it would be enough to blight a young thing's good name, and darken her days till she was grey-headed and had no pleasure in them. That was fine. That was something better than sparkling een or a cherry mou', a haughty carriage and grand clothes. That was something to make her worthy of Randy Drummond. Very like, a soft-spoken, fair tongued lass, who could not say bo to a goose or a witch-wife, would not have been half so steadfast. I'm like the rest of the stupid, selfish world ; I have not judged righteous judgment ; I have condemned the lass un heard, because I grudged Glenfierroch's throw ing himself away, and would have had him go farther and, doubtless, fare worse.

She"], [175, "LET HER ACCUSE ME, MY BIRKIE 171 had paper, pens, and ink stored away in her kist. She brought them out, sat down at the table, and wrote in clear, firm characters, with a strong hand which did not shake : \u2014 \"General Kingscote, \u2014 It was me, Sibbie Bethune of the Snaws, commonly called 'Sonsie Sibbie,' and likewise known as 'the witch-wife,' who let out your secret, and laid bare your plan of campaign against the Earl's Hunt.

But there is one thing I'm rather glad of \u2014 she has cleared that little girl of the Major's over at Balduthie of more than arrant folly in having dealings with a witch, when a lad was in the way.

He, on his part, tak ing the words \"witch-wife\" in sober earnest, and regarding the culprit as less under a civil than an ecclesiastical jurisdiction, laid the document before the members of the Presby tery in which the parish of Duthie, having within its bounds Glenfierroch and the Snaws, was situated. For the Presbytery happened then to be holding a sederunt in the town over which the magistrate presided. The crime of witchcraft was becoming less taken up by \"shirras,\" judges, and juries in civil courts, but from the ambassadors of Divine mercy and peace, the ministers whose office it was to preach salvation to the out cast, there was still little reprieve. In zeal for the maintenance of God's law, for purity of doctrine and life in the professors of Christianity, that charity which makes allow ance for the ignorant, which thinketh no evil, and forbears with the deceiver as with the deceived, was forgotten. The de filer of the sanctuary, the trafficker in for bidden arts, the child of the Devil, was"], [179, "ADAM RATTRAY PLEADS IN VAIN 175 to be unhesitatingly cast out, nay, was to be visited with the vengeance which was a foretaste of the Divine vengeance. God's vicegerents, in His name, hunted down poor wretches of women whom poverty, slander, isolation, persecution, or fantastic superstition had driven desperate, had hardened and mad dened till they imposed upon themselves no less than upon their neighbours. Devout, upright men, kindly in their stern way, on Sabbath days, in their Geneva gowns and white bands, thumped the Bibles on their pulpit ledges. On week-days the men went abroad in black cloaks white at the seams, knee-breeches worn threadbare, rough woollen stockings and uncouth shoes. For the wearers grudged to spend anything they could spare from their meagre incomes on the vanities of life. The ministers would go without dinner or supper ungrudgingly, if so be they could fill an empty stomach or procure a dainty for a sick one. Yet they took compensation in sentencing to the stake and the faggots the ordinarily raving or drivelling creatures accused of witch craft ! Compensation ? No, the judges who condemned the sinners found a solemn, awed satisfaction in their task. Might not the feeble, agonising mortal bodies given over to burning serve to deliver immortal souls from everlast-"], [180, "176 THE WITCH-WIFE ing flames ? Might not the torture extort wild confessions, induce fierce remorse, and broken down penitence, accepted, it was possible, with the criminal's last gasp? Not New England itself was more stanch in delivering over her misguided Quakers and wicked heretics to the death than was Scotland in bringing her witches and warlocks to justice in the centuries succeeding that of the Reformation. Even when the south of Scotland was growing more lax in enforcing this gruesome discipline, in the north, where Celtic sombreness and vividness of imagination contested with Saxon canniness and struggling common-sense (even in Cove nanters and wild Cameronians), rigid fanati cism still held its sway. Sibbie was ignorant of the fate hanging over her. Whatever was her power of project ing her mind into the future, or of learning its sealed- up secrets from others upon whom she could act, who were her instruments, proving as plastic clay in her skilled hands, no assur ance had reached her that her case had been laid before the Presbytery. Yet the next day but one they were to hold a special meeting, when she was to be brought before the mem bers, charged with her guilt, and if she could not clear herself to their satisfaction, as she was hardly likely to do, receive their sentence."], [181, "ADAM RATTRAY PLEADS IN VAIN 177 In the meantime the Snaws was to be closely watched by prickers and church officers, so that even if her master, Satan, gave her in timation of what was before her, there might be no chance of her escaping. There must have been difficulty in guarding a witch-wife who was supposed, as Bonnie Babie had re minded herself, to fly up the lum [chimney], sail through the lift [sky], and change her self at will into a colt or a steer, or even into such small deer as gnawing rats and burrowing moles. Still, it could be done when experienced church officers and prickers were in attendance, and, most important con sideration of all, when the witch-wife was strangely ignorant of her plight. Sibbie was even indulging in hopes of im munity. She had got off scot-free hitherto. She had been her own accuser in the matter of the message to Glenfierroch, and surely that would count in her favour. In any accusation brought against her she could urge in her defence, like Samuel of old, what horse or ass had she taken? Whom had she defrauded of their means? She was conscious that such power as she possessed had been used in blessing, not in cursing ; and life was still sweet to Sibbie, who was not past hale middle-age. It was sweeter to M"], [182, "THE WITCH-WIFE 178 her in those later days than it had been in her earlier years. Time had healed many a wound, and custom had reconciled her to her anomalous position. The next thing to being loved by her fellow-creatures was to be held by them in wholesome awe, which was not destitute of a certain trust in her good-will. If the witch-wife could help them in an ex tremity, they might count upon her doing her best, by whatever weapons it was done. The October weather had changed and improved. The air had become brisk and bracing, instead of raw and chilling to the bone. The hunters' moon was yet to be seen rising late, now that the sky was blue and unclouded and studded with stars. Sibbie was at her door looking out before closing her house for the night, when she saw to her surprise a familiar figure stealing along in the dim light. It was not Glenfierroch ; it was the beast-loving minister, the Rev. Adam Rattray of the Brigton. Unfortunately for Sibbie, he was not her minister. That was the parish minister of Duthie, of whose services she availed herself without prohibition, though not without dark doubts on the minister's part, and denouncing texts aimed at her side long from the reverend gentleman's pulpit. The Rev. Adam was the minister of a neigh-"], [183, "ADAM RATTRAY PLEADS IN VAIN 179 bouring parish, whose acquaintance with Sibbie began and was cemented by tastes they held in common, which culminated in an ex travagant delight in plants and animals. On this ground, to consult her about his field discoveries, to get her advice on the proper treatment of some of his furred and feathered or jointed and scaled dependants, the two were on visiting terms. The Rev. Adam was regarded as some what of an oddity and simpleton, allied to a \" natural \" or fool by the more narrow-minded of his clerical brethren and by the ignorant and prejudiced country people. He was bold enough, however, to come and see Sibbie occasionally, incurring, as he did, the odium of such an eccentricity and impropriety in a man of his cloth. But in his previous visits he had come in broad daylight, without an idea of subterfuge or concealment, with the coolness and hardihood of a man of inde pendent opinions, having a measure of the courage of his opinions. Now the minister came stealing to the door under the gathering shades of night, like those of Sibbie's scared humble clients who were greedy of her aid, yet who shrank from her comely, motherly presence, doubting and disliking her with the creeping doubt and"], [184, "180 THE WITCH-WIFE rooted aversion of those who saw in her an embodiment of unholy craft luring them to sin. Certainly Adam Rattray was neither cool nor hardened on this occasion. He wiped the sweat-drops from his forehead, and looked over his shoulder apprehensively, as he dived down the flagged pathway, past Sibbie stand ing in the doorway, with only a muttered \"Good -even.\" He knew he was risking more than his life. He was without wife or child, so that his death mattered less. He was imperilling his character for orthodoxy. He was a little man, with a large head, bright eyes, and restless hands, whom Sibbie held in some esteem, and was ready to wel come. \" Is this you, Mr. Rattray? How's all with you this night? Is aught wrong that you're in such hot haste, and so late? Have you lost the five-toed kitty you prized so high ? Has the wasp's nest come alive in your study, and driven your housekeeper wud, and you out of house and hold ? Have you found the lychnis I telled you my father kenned of, but he did not come upon it till his strength was failing, so that he could never take me to the exact spot where he said it grew.

I have various cordials which I keep in case of need. Shall it be balm wine ? or will you try a drop of strong waters ? \" \" Nothing of the kind, Sibbie,\" Adam Rat tray at last found voice to say. \" There's nothing ails me. It is you, woman \u2014 you I've come to warn to flee for your life. There's time yet.

There, you can take your passage in a smack for the Hebrides or Ireland, or better still, for Holland or France.\" Sibbie changed colour instinctively and gripped the table against which she was leaning, but she showed no other sign of dis-"], [186, "182 THE WITCH-WIFE composure. She must have often anticipated the announcement which was made to her, though it had been less present to her mind half-an-hour before than on many a previous occasion. It must have haunted her dreams, till she grew cold with chattering teeth in its clutch. It must have hung darkly over num berless waking hours as the sentence of death. That parting between soul and body which is physical death, passed upon all men, will flash across the mind of the youngest and gayest at the merriest, most thoughtless mo ment, and startle the laugher and jester into sudden sobriety and brief pensiveness. The anticipation was to be realised at last ; but still Sibbie was ignorant of the precise nature of the impending calamity. \"Who and what am I to run from, Mr. Rattray ? \" she asked quickly. \" I'm none so young and keen on the road as I have been, so that I should rise and take my foot in my hand at a bare word. Is it the English General who is bringing a troop to arrest me because I fooled him in his man\u0153uvres \u2014 me, a poor widow woman ! \" and the strong humanity within her, warped and stamped out of its original noble shape and gracious mould by harsh misconception treading on the heels of grievous sorrow, laughed a loud,"], [187, "ADAM RATTRAY PLEADS IN VAIN 183 gibing laugh at the absurdity of the anti climax. \"Whisht! whisht!\" implored the minister, stopping from plucking at his waistcoat but tons to hold up hands of horror at the sound. \"I'm saying no ill,\" maintained Sibbie. \" Eh! but he must be a small man, that General, to bring a regiment of sodgers with drawn swords and cocked guns, no doubt, against a lone woman who surrendered herself at discretion, so throwing herself on his mercy, to save him from misdoubting some of his and the King's best friends, and from flegging [frightening] a bit silly lassie out of what wits she has.\" \"You're on a wrong tack,\" groaned Adam Rattray, forsaking his buttons to clutch at the grizzled locks of his hair. \" It is worse, poor Sibbie, a hantle worse for you than being seized by the General and brought under mili tary law, though he had the heart to make you mount the wooden horse, or stand and be shot.

She could still preserve her self-control, and even make a feint of her old disdain. \"So it is a regi ment of black and not of buff coats who are to heckle me, that I may be delivered over to their tender mercies ; and when I come to think of it, you are one of the regiment, minister.\" \"To my misery I am,\" he admitted; \"but spare me the upshot, which would fill me with remorse to my dying day.

She has raised many a tempest in which hundreds of unhappy women have perished"], [193, "ADAM RATTRAY PLEADS IN VAIN 189 since she raised the auld man in the mantle.\" \" Those who traffic with familiar spirits are condemned, and that 'a witch shall not live ' is writ in the Word,\" argued the minister. \" That is as true as death, minister,\" owned Sibbie, with the utmost candour. \"But all your examples are from the auld dispensation. The lass in the New Testa ment who brought her masters much money by divination was not cited to the market place and burned to ashes by the command of the Apostle Paul \u2014 at least, not so far as Scripture testifies. Do you not think now,\" speaking with confidential earnestness, but still as if dealing with an abstract question, \"that the witches spoken of meant \u2014 even in the Auld Testament \u2014 false pretenders, liars, traders on their neighbours' fears, and the like ? The witch of Endor did not expect to bring up Samuel when King Saul set her to try her incantations ; she was nigh swarfin [fainting] when she found what she had done. Forby, cheatery of that kind is the high-road to madness.\" \" I have you there,\" said Rattray, half under his breath; \"we are weak, silly creatures at the best.\""], [194, "THE WITCH-WIFE 190 \"'Deed we are, sir,\" acquiesced Sibbie readily. \" But will you tell me that you accept as gospel the foul foamings at the mouth of miserable, demented women when they boast their shameless bairns' tales, and how they held their orgies in the King of France's wine-cellars, where the bodies broached King Lewis's casks, and drank his wine in the ill company of other witches and warlocks, with Clootie, their lord and master, at their head. Or how they sat on the top of the kirk steeple and laughed at the misfortunes which befell the minister and the congregation ? \u2014 what were they? He forgot, and stuck in the middle of his finest sentence ; the precentor lost his line of the psalm ; and the bairn to be chris tened girned and screeched till neither prayer nor chapter could be heard. The deaf wives sitting in the 'lateran,'1 seeing the faces of the father and the minister, thought the lofts were falling, and got up and banged down the stair in a band, raising a greater hulla baloo.\" \" It were hard to believe,\" sighed Adam Rattray, fidgeting on his seat. \" Then there are the witches' tales of stick ing preens into wax dollies and melting them 1 A railed-in space round the pulpit in which there were seats which deaf men and women could occupy."], [195, "ADAM RATTRAY PLEADS IN VAIN 191 before slow fires to revenge themselves on their enemies,\" went on Sibbie relentlessly. \" Well, I'm not denying that there are black hearts in the world, choke-full of malice and venom, that might ettle [try] at such vile prac tices ; but are the witches almighty to control Providence and rule human events? Where is the faith of you ministers in God in heaven, whose servants you profess to be, that you cannot trust Him to thwart and crush ini quity ? \" \" Sibbie Bethune ! \" cried the man, driven to stand at bay, \" our Maker permits evil and the Evil One, as you know well. We cannot tell for what end ; we can only trust Him. As for me, I have sat on witches' trials because I could not help myself, but I never harried any woman young or old be fore the Presbytery. I never started the prickers on their search. I never raised my voice to condemn a witch. I might have raised it to condone her guilt, or her fancied guilt, if I had not known my word would be useless.\" \" I believe you,\" said Sibbie with conviction. \"You're an honest, canny gentleman, a scholar \u2014 whether you're a powerful preacher, and I've heard to the contrary, matters less since the root of the matter is in you. The breath"], [196, "THE WITCH-WIFE 192 of your nostrils is peace, and that should be laid to your credit, for is not your Master called the Prince of Peace?

It was not generous of me to taunt you with the faults of others, though they are your brethren, and you've to sit with them and be consenting to their decrees \u2014 for the sake of purity, they say, and order. I beg your pardon, sir.\" \"Woman, woman, hold your tongue,\" cried Adam Rattray, rising to his feet and waving her aside wildly as she also rose, for it was the man and not the woman who was near to being in a frenzy. She understood it and opened the door for him, saying softly as she would have soothed a child's paroxysm of distress, \"Go your ways, minister; you're a good man and a kind, though you may not be a Samson or a Boanerges in spirit. If it will make you sleep sounder, take it to your heart and conscience that you came to my rescue at your own proper peril, and did what you could to make a wilful woman change her gate.\" He stumbled out, but even on the threshold he turned back imploringly, \" Will you not take a second thought, Sibbie? There's time yet.\""], [197, "ADAM RATTRAY PLEADS IN VAIN 193 She shook her head. \"The time's gone, long gone. Fare you well, Mr. Rattray. Bid your housekeeper send you up a hot drink, and swallow it before you go to bed, to keep off the chill from a late walk.\" N"], [198, "194 CHAPTER XIII THE LOWE (FLAME) ON THE KNOCK (HILL) All the next day Glenfierroch rode and ran like a madman. The tidings of Sibbie's danger had reached him, and he did not leave a stone unturned to save her. He interrupted the magistrate conducting public business in the very court itself; he intruded on minister after minister in the privacy of their studies. He entreated and urged, raged and threatened. The marvel was that he was not accused and arrested as the accom plice of Sonsie Sibbie. But he had three sources of defence : he was the young Laird of Glenfierroch ; there was a little of the heart of humanity beneath the official crust ; the tie between foster-child and foster-mother had a certain sacredness in that district close to the Highlands, because the passion and imagination of the Celt served to warm and colour the relation in the eyes of the more stolid but not less faithful Saxon, until the"], [199, "THE LOWE ON THE KNOCK 195 Lowland nurse was exalted into the position ofthe Highland \"moome.\" Glenfierroch had not prospered in his efforts, and it was tired as a dog, spent in body and mind, despairing and reckless of appearances, that he repaired towards nightfall, without the shadow of disguise, to the beleaguered Snaws. He sat down by Sibbie without a word, and with a world of misery in his blue eyes ; he flung his arms across the table, and laid down his head on them. There should have been a gleam of consola tion to Glenfierroch in the fact that his Babie was not only safe, forgiven, and reinstated in her uncles' good graces \u2014 she was weeping her eyes out in sympathy with his sorrow, and in rueful compassion for the woman who had come forward and sacrificed herself for Babie's de liverance. But the knowledge was counter balanced by the gnawing consciousness that it was he who had stirred up Sibbie to accuse herself to General Kingscote. He had offered up Sibbie in the place of Babie. She, Sibbie, might have lived down the scandal which had been busy with her name for many a year. It was not probable that she would have been arraigned at this date before either the civil court or the Presbytery for any offence of a less exceptional and aggressive nature than"], [200, "196 THE WITCH-WIFE that committed against the King's officer and his forces. Babie in the same situation might have had a chance ; but for Sonsie Sibbie, reckoned habit and repute a witch, a poor elderly woman without a friend save Glen fierroch, the case was desperate. The last terrible rigour of ecclesiastical law stared her in the face. She was rubbing shoulder with the stake and the faggots. Glenfierroch knew better than the Rev. Adam Rattray had com prehended that flight in the circumstances was impracticable. \" Poor lad, poor Lairdie, do not take on so,\" Sibbie implored, patting him on the shoulder and stroking his bent head, as she had not done of late. \"I'm not worth such lamenta tion. Forby, life is but a breath, and I've drawn a fair long breath. I'm a thought weary of the warstle [struggle] and the misjudgments. I've kenned lightsome joy and I've kenned heavy tribulation. I'm not like to ken either again \u2014 only the middle road, which grows dull to slowing feet. And, Randy Drummond, I've a way, a secret which I may not tell to you lest it bring you scathe ; but this I will say beforehand, it can rob even this death which lies before me of its bitterness.\" He lifted up a white, drawn face, and spoke madly. \"God will not hear, Sibbie. He's"], [201, "THE LOWE ON THE KNOCK 197 deaf to you and me. Oh ! will your friend the Deil not help you ? \" \" Whisht ! Glenfierroch, whisht ! \u2014 you too ? \" she cried at first, with stern reproach. Then the grotesqueness of the piteous appeal struck her, and awoke in her that strain of the outcast and the randy bred in her by her experience. \" Touts! Glenfierroch ; have you never heard the bonnie sang?\" she mocked him. \"Did I never croon it to you when you were a bairn ? \" She lifted up her voice, full and sweet as ever, and rang out the wild ditty which might have reached the ears of Rab Gilhaize or Saunders Hay, beyond the brae : \u2014 Some say the Deil's dead, The Deil's dead, the Deil's dead, Some say the Deil's dead, And buried in Kirkcaldy.\" \"That is the reason,\" she went on to ex plain, \" why ' the lang town ' is so long. The townsmen biggit it to keep him down. They had a sore fight to get him to lie still. Every now and then he threatened to be up and out.

Have you lost your wits beforehand, as they say women have done in your plight ? \" cried Glenfierroch, with a sob in his voice, which recalled her to herself. \" I'm wise1 enough,\" she said, sobering down instantly. \" It was just one of my flings at you and the rest of the world. Fy for shame on me that I should have a fling this night of all nights ! but if I had not laughed whiles in my sleeve and in folks' faces, and made faces at them before their een, I would have died lang syne \u2014 better for mysel' maybe, but not for you, my dear lad, if I had slipped away when you needed me.\" \" Ay, Sibbie, you gave me life and I have given you death \u2014 that has been your recom pense at my hands,\" Randy Drummond made his moan. \" Never ; you have given me all I cared for since your wee arms were round my neck and you were my bairn. You pulled me back to life when I had little to live for. You'll break my heart if you reproach yourself as you are doing, either now or in the time to come. You did right ; it was no more than you were bound to do to stand up for Mistress Babie, your bonnie young wife that is to be. 1 Pronounced \" wice \" when used in the sense of rational."], [203, "THE LOWE ON THE KNOCK 199 Do you think so ill of me as to believe that, whether you hacl interfered or no, I would have held my peace and let another, a bit lassie, stand in my shoon ?

Why, Laird, I was the witch-wife who might have been denounced and had up before the Presby tery and sentenced, any time this score of years, ere you had a beard to your chin, ere you could mount a horse or stand your lone, before you were born. Only better late than ear'. You'll not feel the want of me ; you'll have other com pany. And you'll have pleasant thoughts of me \u2014 na, I could not thole that they should be bitter with idle regrets. I tell you solemnly, Randy Drummond, what I may not tell you plain, lest they catch and cross-question you in their fury, but what you may see for your self when the time comes, if you dare look my way \u2014 I've a shield and a defence now that my hair is full of grey threads, which I did not call mine when I could walk a dozen miles without drawing breath, and when there were no silver locks underneath my widow's cap.\" He could not guess what she meant, and she failed altogether to alleviate his wretched-"], [204, "THE WITCH-WIFE 200 ness. Then she desisted from her arguments, and contented herself with pressing affection ately on him the food and drink he had not tasted that day ; but he turned from them with sick loathing, his throat refusing to swallow. At last, heavy with sorrow, utterly exhausted, strong young man as he was, he fell asleep in the blaze of the fire she was heaping up to keep the chill of weariness and grief from his bones. When Sibbie realised that the merciful re prieve had been granted to Glenfierroch which comes unsought, in their Maker's pity, to some mourners, she looked at the sleeper wistfully, longingly ; she took a step forward, saying to herself, \"What for no? It will be but this once, and it will remain a mystery to him, as in troth it remains a mystery to me, as it has done to Rory Menzies. There will be none to repeat it \u2014 least of all Glen fierroch, young and ignorant as he is of the hidden depths of his own nature. He may not be able to stand, even afar off, poor laddie ! and witness the \u2014 the job which has to be accomplished. This would give him a glint of it. This would help him to believe what I trust will be a marvel, in the sight of the near bystanders, reported by them and spoken of for years to come.

It is for his sake I employ the means, though I'll not deny that I'm craving for a rehearsal of the play with the assurance that I'm not deceiving myself. But what does it matter? The death agony even by fire cannot last longer than sailors in burning ships, and women and bairns in blazing houses, have borne many a time before me, and will bear many a time after me.\" She was stooping over Randy Drummond in his heavy sleep, lightly stroking his fore head, and passing her hands to and fro before his closed eyes, till his head fell back helplessly, and the pallor of wearied sleep in his face became like unto the pallor of death. \" Speak to me, my man,\" she charged him ; \"speak, and tell me what you see.\" The blue lips moved mechanically, and the far-away voice of one who is absent in the spirit replied, \"I'm climbing the Knock among the birks and heather. The strath of the Earn is under my feet, and the blue hills of Duniera and Glen Turret lie yonder.\" \" You ken the place ? \" \" I ken it well. I've mounted the Knock scores of times with my gun. Once Sonsie Sibbie carried me in her arms up to the top,"], [206, "THE WITCH-WIFE 202 when I was a wee callant, that I might breathe the caller air.\" \"She did that, and Tyke was with us. He hunted the rabbits, which was a great pleasure to you and him ; but I had to hurry down lest Monzie's keepers should come upon us and find us trespassing. That was a bonnie summer day, and we were taking our pleasure. Now the trees are bare and the heather is brown, and folk do not mount the Knock for pleasure. Are you your lone, Glenfierroch ? \" \" No, I'm in a crowd, every man and woman struggling to get to the top and command a good view.\" \" What kind of view ? \u2014 not just of the hills and glens which are most blotted out on a misty October day ? \" \"They're looking up, not down.

She must not bide, for there is a pillar of smoke rising in the sky, and tongues of flame. The Knock's alowe, and it will spread. Away, Sibbie! away, woman, away!\" The voice grew loud and hoarse as of one who warns an unconscious person of the approach of deadly danger, while the features of the sleeper worked convulsively. \" Canny, Randy, canny, or you'll not see the end,\" and Sibbie stroked the young man's twitching limbs, and wiped the sweat-drops from his forehead. \" How is she bearing her self? I'm keen to hear, and it is my one chance. Are her hands bound ? Quick, tell me ! \"Her hands are free.\" \" God be thanked ! \" muttered Sibbie. \"She's put them to her neck and rugged [torn] at her lammer beads, and bitten the string till it has given way, and they've fallen like a shower of fire-drops into the fire at her feet \u2014 all but the biggest.\" \" What has she done with that ? \" \" She has gripped it and flung it over the heads of the ring to somebody in the crowd.

Fy ! I can smell its strong sweet stink. Her hands have fallen by her side.

They are licking her knees, her shoulders, her face, with their cruel yellow tongues and red fangs. But they cannot waken her.\" His cry sank into an awed whisper : \" She'll never wake till the Day of Judgment.\" \" Amen ! \" responded Sibbie fervently. Presently Sibbie set herself to arouse Glen fierroch from his trance. \" Where am I ? \" he gasped with returning consciousness. \" Where have I been ? I thought I witnessed a fearsome sight \u2014 like"], [209, "THE LOWE ON THE KNOCK 205 that they said would happen.\" His voice failed him, and he shuddered violently. \" You were here, Glenfierroch, by me \" \u2014 Sibbie soothed him \u2014 \" where you have been blithe to be many a night. You were in no worse place ; but you were dog-tired, and little wonder, so you dropped asleep, which was the best thing you could do, in the heat of the fire I had made to put life into you.

The Presbytery, which has cited me to appear before them, may take another thought, or they may desire your testimony. You must go to your house and take what you can get of a night's rest, or you will not be fit to face friend or foe. I lay my bidding upon you \u2014 it may be my last, and you'll not resist it, my dear lad.\" \"I'm as weak as water, Sibbie,\" he groaned, staggering to his feet, \"and I can see no other way.\""], [210, "CHAPTER XIV THE END OF TYKE Whether or not Sonsie Sibbie slept or lay awake, with those cool hazel eyes of hers, which were tranquil and serene, save when she took her \" flings,\" staring open in the dim obscurity of her room, lighted only by the fire smouldering under a \"gathering peat,\" during the long hours of semi-dark ness after the moon had set, she rose betimes to set her house in order. She was well aware it was for the last time ; she would never see it again. After the sentence of the Presbytery was passed upon her, she would be taken to the town jail, and from that to the Knock, where, in broad day, in the most conspicuous spot in the district, held up as a beacon to the tempted, she would expiate her crime of witchcraft. There was not much to be done in the matter of sweeping and tidying the house place. Sibbie, with different habits from those commonly attributed to her sisterhood, 206"], [211, "THE END OF TYKE 207 was the most cleanly and orderly of house wives. \"They're wont to say witches' houses are dirty dens,\" she told herself. \"They'll not have that to say of my bonnie house when they come to harry it and smash my sticks of furniture. The Snaws will be left an empty hole to fall into ruins. No douce man or woman will come to take up their quarters in a cot-house where a witch has dwelt \u2014 not even with a horse- shoe nailed above the door, and a slip of the rowan stitched into the bed curtains. Folk will point their finger at my garden and the shed Glenfierroch has put up for my wee cattle. Bairns will scamper by and not look behind them. There will soon be no path to the door. Vagabond loons will make a show of boldness in dragging it off the hinges, and pulling down the thatch, and a bit here and there of the walls, till the whole building sink into a rickle [heap] of stanes crowned by a crop of nettles. That is all which will be left of the hoosie where my father found a resting-place \u2014 where I nursed him in his bouts of falling sickness \u2014 where I steeked his een \u2014 where my Jock came tramping merrily from the coast when his ship was in \u2014 where he left me a happy wife and came back never more\u2014 where our bairn,"], [212, "208 THE WITCH-WIFE which he never saw, drew his first and last breath \u2014 where Randy Drummond lay in the breast Jockie left warm. I'll not be here to heed. I'll be with my own again, my man and my bairn and my wise auld father, if the Lord of the universe wills. I would not have Glenfierroch seek to keep up the place and draw down scorn and trouble upon himself.\" She put up a few articles, among them the gaudily coloured foreign print of Jock's ship, at which she cast a last admiring glance, and addressed them to the Laird of Glenfierroch, trusting vaguely that they might come into the hands of some honest person, some servant from the house of Glenfierroch. She acted similarly with the boxes containing her \"wee cattle\" of birds and beasts, desiring that if anybody would do a charitable act for innocent beasts, then some of them might be conveyed to Glenfierroch, and some to the manse of the Brigton, to the Rev. Adam Rattray, who was well kenned to be a lover of beasts, and would make them welcome. But first she fed them sumptuously, according to their various habits and tastes, while to Tyke she gave a sevenfold portion of the sheep's liver and \"lights\" he loved. \"And now, Tyke, we must end it,\" she told him,"], [213, "THE END OF TYKE 209 \"in kindness to you and to me, for I could not thole that you should be abused and me not there to hold the villains off.\" She flung her arms round the old dog and re minded him that he had been Jock's dog. He and she and Jock had all three been young together, and they had walked out sweethearting in the long gloamings, when sweethearts met and held their trysts. Jock had bidden Tyke take care of his mistress till his master came back, the last time he had crossed the threshold, and well Tyke had fulfilled his trust. \" But now you are grown blind and deaf and stiff, and but for your loving heart the days would be at hand when you would have no more pleasure in them ; so what would you do without your mistress, Tyke, even though they suffered you to live, instead of starving or stoning you to death, and you found a refuge at Glenfierroch ? Na, na ; we must not get Lairdie into tribulation, not even for you, Tyke.\" Tyke listened to it all with a dog's wistful, wondering sympathy, and returned her endear ments with slobbering caresses. Presently Sibbie rose and sought out a large goose-quill, in the hollow of which there was a dark liquid corked up to prevent spilling. o"], [214, "THE WITCH-WIFE 210 She took out the cork, and after making, with the sharp edges of the mouth of the quill, a puncture in the neck of the dog, which sub mitted to the operation at the hands of his mistress with a wag of his tail and a lick of her fingers, \"Good dog,\" she said, \"to trust an auld friend ; but maybe you ken all about it, that I would not hurt you if I could help myself, and that it is you first and me next.\" She injected half of the liquid into the slight wound, but hardly waited for the drug to take effect and the dog to grow drowsy, since the time was short and she must make assurance doubly sure. Scientific discoveries to which poor Sibbie had attained by sheer mother-wit, were only in their crudest, most elementary stages to her. What science has perfected to a hair's-breadth, and can accomplish with nice precision and quick despatch, Sibbie could only do in a blundering, tentative way, with clumsy elaboration and bungling repetition. She fetched a cloth soaked in a second liquid, the subtle odour of which floated into every corner of the room. She spread the cloth over the dog's mouth and nose, holding the corners tight with a firm grasp, for Tyke was no longer quiescent ; he was struggling wildly, and uttering a long, gasping, wailing howl, which gradually sank into silence. She re-"], [215, "THE END OF TYKE 211 moved the cloth, and Tyke lay stretched out motionless, breathless, dead. \" Nought will hurt you more, my dog,\" she said softly and sadly; \"you're beyond the reach of the silly, heartless fules who said you were the black Deil himsel' \u2014 you who never harmed beast or body, save the vermin it was your instinct to keep down \u2014 you who were better, less selfish, more loving and leal, than many a Christian man and woman.\" She lifted the large animal gently, as if he still felt her touch, in her strong arms, his head, in which the filmy eyes of age were already taking another glaze, resting against her shoulder. She carried her burden into the garden behind the house. The day be fore, when seeking to save up her strength, as she had enjoined Randy Drummond to spare his, she had chanced to see a gangrel (wayfarer), a strange beggar man who knew nothing of her, of her character or her strait, passing along the country path. She had called him in, given him bite and sup, and feed him to dig a hole sufficiently broad and deep between the breaks of cabbages and potatoes. \" It's like a grave, mistress,\" the man had said, looking in surprise at his task when it was done."], [216, "THE WITCH-WIFE 212 \" Ay, it's like a grave,\" she acknowledged calmly ; \"but have no fear, murder of the kind you call murder has not been committed \u2014 yet ; there is no danger of you being taken up as art and part in the deed. It is but the grave of a dog, the best friend a lone woman ever had, to keep him from being hounded and stoned, or flung with a weight round his neck into the water, and his dead carcass cast out to rot on a midden.\" The man had stared and gone away, think ing the widow woman, strapping and wise-like for her years, and hospitable and liberal as she had been to him \u2014 maybe all the more likely on that account, for the ordinary world was hard on gangrels \u2014 must be a thought touched in her head. Sibbie lowered Tyke carefully into the hole, taking care that he did not strike the sides and bring down the soil roughly upon him, before she spread the earth over him with the spade the man had used. She happed Tyke up with her own hands in his last bed, as she would have happed a bairn in its cradle, smoothing the final sprinkling of earth as she would have smoothed a daintily patched quilt, and putting it into order with fond hands. \"There, I have done my best for you, my poor auld Tyke.

The members were met together for an ex traordinary meeting, not in the vestry, where General Kingscote's letter had been read to them, but in the church itself. Sibbie, in spite of her submission to autho rity, was hustled in by the church and the town's officers. The pricker, that most odious of credulous and besotted officials \u2014 for he was not always a hypocrite and impostor \u2014 had done his hideous work, and communicated the result to his employers. The witnesses who were to give evidence against the witch-wife were ranged in their places. The trial was not conducted with closed doors. As many of the public as could gain formal admittance, or could press in with or without permission, were jammed in a swaying mass, from the door half-way up the aisle. A trial for witch craft, which was becoming a rarer indulgence than it had been in former generations, was a"], [219, "SIBBIE BEFORE THE PRESBYTERY 215 more attractive and exciting event even than a trial for murder in the present day. It had just that mixture of the supernatural and the sensational which stimulates most effectually the dull and coarse-minded. It was an event which could only be surpassed in harrowing interest and gloating horror by the actual burning of the witch. When the witch was a neighbour, a more or less well-known and familiar figure which for years had been re garded with suspicious and critical eyes, the zest with which the gossips hearkened to the tale was intensified. It would be hard to decide to what extent the judges and the audience were affected when, as it occurred sometimes, the witch to be tried was no toothless, blear-eyed creature, mumbling and blinking as she uttered her spells and mixed her philtres, but a spirited or sedate woman, young or middle-aged, more or less superior in position and attainments to the bulk of the company, who had in consequence bitterly offended many of them by standing aloof from them. In Sibbie's case the offence was aggravated by the fact of her having come a stranger girl, with a stranger father who laboured under the incomprehensible disease of epilepsy, to dwell in the district ; while probably the cir-"], [220, "216 THE WITCH-WIFE cumstance that she had been the Laird of Glenfierroch's foster-mother, and was upheld by him, lent another kind of distinction to the proceedings. The clerical judges in ranks of black-mantled figures supported each other, occasionally ex changing remarks on the evidence. There was the formality of a table, at which sat the clerk of the Presbytery, one of the ministers, with his ink-horn, and the book in which he was to enter the minutes of the transaction. There was also a moderator, who in his Geneva gown occupied the precentor's box, as at once nearer the assembly and of a less sacred character than the pulpit. He presided over the meeting, commencing and concluding the business, and calling any transgressing member or witness to order. Everything was done duly and discreetly according to established precedent. Several of the judges were black-browed, heavy-jawed men. But Sibbie's minister, who happened to be moderator, had originally been a man of flaxen-haired fairness. Time had sprinkled the flaxen with grey, which lent it an ashen tint ; while his clearly cut, deeply lined beardless face was blanched to an ivory whiteness. No dark face there was so coldly set, so austerely rigid in its colourlessness."], [221, "SIBBIE BEFORE THE PRESBYTERY 217 Some of the members had the fire of mad enthusiasm in their eyes. Some were pictures of stolidity following where their leaders went, bound to them hand and foot. Others \u2014 a few, like the Rev. Adam Rattray, afforded glimpses of haggard faces, half dazed with doubt and despair, or quivering with uncontrollable emo tion. When the court was opened by a prayer well-nigh fierce in its earnest invocation to God on high to overthrow and crush the works and the agents of the Devil, there was a pause and a long breath drawn of gratified expectation. Sibbie, who had been held in the background by her guards, was freed from their grasp, and impelled forward. She re covered her balance on the instant, and walked with an erect carriage and a firm step to the other side of the clerk's table, where, in consideration of her sex and possible weakness, a seat had been humanely provided for her. She preferred, however, to stand, facing the clerk, the main body of her judges, and the spectators and listeners. In her shabby, tidy widow's weeds, her \"lammer beads\" hanging glistening on her breast, with the still comely, bountiful womanliness of her middle age un disturbed by bootless rage or panic terror, she was the most impressive figure in the company."], [222, "THE WITCH-WIFE 218 She cast only a passing look at her judges, sedulously avoiding, in doing so, the glance of the Rev. Adam Rattray of the Brigton, shrink ing from observation, sinking down in a heap, clutching at the ends of his neck-cloth till the cambric hung limp and unsightly. But she searched eagerly among the faces under the beavers, blue bonnets, and light or dark hoods, till her eyes fell on the object they sought. Her face kindled with a flush of pleased recognition, though she turned away her head determinedly, and exchanged no greeting with Glenfierroch standing in the forefront of the crowd, showing a face ten times more troubled than her own. It was rash of him, but he was not ashamed to own the tie between them, and he was there to see justice done to her, as far as mortal man could compass it. The moderator addressed the court. As in his prayer, he expressed his ardent desire that the sanctuary of their Church and their Christian country might be kept pure and unpolluted by the presence of the Devil and his servants working with damnable arts, horrible profani ties, and detestable crimes among the brethren. He testified to his profound sorrow and shame for the laxity which was creeping into the Church and tempting its members to sinfully overlook, excuse, and leave unpunished a"], [223, "SIBBIE BEFORE THE PRESBYTERY 219 heinous sin. He trusted that he, his fellow ministers, and their Elders might repent and be forgiven for their carelessness and coldness in failing to seek out the signs of the evil spirit at work in their parishes. He trusted that those who bore the Lord's commission and were vowed to His service would keep in mind that the garment spotted by the flesh was de filed by the Devil's token, as their own officer had deponed, and by the unhallowed allegiance given by the wearer to the foul fiend and his angels, so that such a one could no longer be tolerated in a Christian congregation. This was so. Then, even for the sake of the abandoned wretch who had rebelled against the Creator and Redeemer, and sold herself to their deadly enemy, if so be repentance was yet possible to her, they must proceed in the only way which was prescribed \u2014 to save her as by fire, giving her mortal body to be burnt, in order that her immortal soul might be purged from its iniquities. The clerk read the indictment, contained in the minutes of the last meeting of the Pres bytery, whereby Sibbie or Sibella Bethune, commonly called \" Sonsie Sibbie,\" and known throughout the district as \"the witch-wife,\" was summoned before the bar of the Pres bytery to answer an accusation of having"], [224, "THE WITCH-WIFE 220 been guilty of the detestable crime of witch craft. The moderator \u2014 the minister of Duthie, Sibbie's own minister \u2014 again raised his ashen head and blanched face above the assembly and craved leave to speak a few more words, and those on his own account. He took \" shame to himself,\" he said, his stern, blood less face working in the depth of his earnest ness as he confessed his culpable weakness. He felt bound to make a clean breast of it, in order that it might be a warning to his reve rend brethren. He had long suffered to live in his parish a woman by common report a witch, and that without any attempt to bring her to justice. He had been withheld from doing his plain duty by three specious reasons. There had been but few and vague charges of malicious wrong - doing brought against this woman ; while, on the contrary, she was credited with skill and kindness in minister ing to the sick, since she was in possession of her dead father's knowledge as an herb doctor. Secondly, she had not neglected the ordi nances of the Church. She had attended preachings and sacraments. But he might have known on both counts that, though good works are enjoined, the semblance may"], [225, "SIBBIE BEFORE THE PRESBYTERY 221 be so put on as to deceive the very elect. Again, though witches and evil - doers are wont to withdraw from the sanctuary \u2014 in deed, there is a current belief that they dare not come within its bounds lest the roof fall upon them, or the stones cry out against the sacrilege \u2014 still they had it on the best authority that Satan could quote Scripture, wresting it to the destruction of his miser able victims, and that he could show him self like an angel of light. Moreover, when the blessed Supper was first eaten, a traitor, a devil-possessed traitor, sat down at the same table with the apostles and their Master, if he did not handle the elements. Thirdly, this woman \u2014 this Sibbie Bethune \u2014 had been in the service of an honourable family in the parish, whose name was or should have been a warrant that she was of decent character. Sibbie listened to it all \u2014 prayer, indict ment, moderator's address, and apology of her minister for his shortcomings where she was concerned \u2014 without the flicker of an eye lid \u2014 nay, with her quick wit catching at every advantage, fruitless as any exercise of her wit was likely to be. She could have thanked her minister for inadvertently testifying to her worth, had not the audacity of such a"], [226, "THE WITCH-WIFE 222 step in the circumstances rendered it an impossibility. As it was, she was to pay heavily for her coolness, her unquenchable spirit, the inexhaustible sense of humour which prompted her to \"speak up\" repeatedly in her own defence. The witnesses were called, and first came the pricker, a large man with a fat flabby face and goggle eyes. He gave formal evi dence that he had experienced little difficulty in detecting the Devil's mark by which he identified his own, on the person of Sonsie Sibbie. It was on the right arm midway between the \"oxter\" and the elbow. The hellish stamp was not ill to see. \"Honest man\" \u2014 Sibbie suddenly raised her voice \u2014 \" will you not likewise tell my explanation of the mark ? It was a scar gotten when Lucky Bain's change-house was on fire and I helped to pull her auld bed ridden good-mother off the chaff bed when it was a-lunt [in a blaze].\" Sibbie was indignantly bidden to be silent. She was disturbing the order of the court. She must reserve her defence. Her time to speak, whether in justification or confes sion, had not come. But to be silent in the temper into which wrong versions of her behaviour, and grossly grotesque misinterpre-"], [227, "SIBBIE BEFORE THE PRESBYTERY 223 tations of incidents in which she had played her part, drove Sibbie, was exactly what she could not be, though it may still be main tained that she was naturally a reasonable, decorous woman. She must assert herself even with the consciousness that each ex ample of such self-assertion would be regarded as hardened insolence and brazen-faced insen sibility to the situation, and would do injury to her cause. But she was silent when the witnesses who followed contented themselves with piling up a heap of confused, incoherent assertions that she healed disease by magic, induced sleep by the movements of her hands, laid fever and restrained delirium by the touch of her fingers ; and she vouchsafed no reply to old patients who shuffled with their feet, and could not look her in the face when they thus bore testimony against her. She re garded them wistfully and pitifully, and only muttered to herself, \"Eh! poor creatures, have you the heart ? are you not feared lest a worse thing befall you ? \" Neither did she deign to pass an audible remark when more incredible and unproven statements were brought forward against her. A small-eyed, jealous little woman, who had been too good a Christian to consult the witch-wife, had, she"], [228, "THE WITCH-WIFE 224 alleged, in Sonsie Sibbie's revenge for the slight, lost every \"casting\" (swarm) of bees from her \" skeps \" that summer. A sullen, loose-limbed man had had words with Sibbie about his treatment of a lame horse which was his own to deal with as he thought fit, and forthwith his sister's son had fallen into vicious courses and taken to horse-stealing, for which he had shown no inclination before, and had been caught in the act and come to the gallows. Sibbie's self-control and her gravity alike gave way, however, when a couple of gaping rustics with huge red ears came forward and gabbled out a story. They had been watch ing Sonsie Sibbie returning in the gloaming from some of her errands, when just as they came over the brow of the hill beyond the Byres, and they should have had her full in view, she had clean vanished from the road ; but in the field on the left side of the road there was a grey beast which flung up its heels with a fearsome roar and galloped across the pasture. At this point Sibbie laughed out, actually laughed aloud \u2014 could effrontery and callous ness go further? \" It was a fell fool-like trick of me at my time of life,\" she admitted with shamefaced deprecation. \" But what would you"], [229, "SIBBIE BEFORE THE PRESBYTERY 225 have ? I saw the gowks jinking and glowering after the witch-wife, and I thought I would give them something to jink and glower at. So when they lost sight of me for a minute or two, I was so left to myself as to loup the dyke on my left hand and lie down flat behind it. And what should I do but frighten Willie Nicholson's cuddie, which had been chawing thistles by the dyke-side, till off he rampaged, hee-hawing like mad.\" \"Woman,\" cried the outraged moderator, \"hold your tongue. Mind you're on your trial. You've no call to make a mock at reputable witnesses\u2014 at the very court itself. Such wantonness will make it worse for you in the end.\" Sibbie did not laugh when the abashed rustics were succeeded by a scared-looking, white - faced young girl, and an older woman with wild eyes and trembling limbs. The pair were pushed in by excited, wrathful relatives, who complained that the two were bewitched.1 Their days and nights were spent in thrills and tremors. The victims laughed the one moment and cried the next.

They could with difficulty refrain from screaming loud out in the kirk and blasphemously contra dicting the minister. The elder woman had flung her Bible into the fire, and the young lass had torn her Catechism to tatters. Would not the ministers help the distressed kindred ? Would not they compel the witch-wife to unloose her cruel bonds ? \"Sirs, sirs!\" cried Sibbie, throwing up her hands in passionate protest, with a mixture of utmost compassion and \u2014 as her eyes met, steadied, and overpowered for an instant those of the woman \u2014 scornful repulsion, \" I have done them no wrong ; their help lies in themselves.

As for the woman, auld enough to have bairns of her own, she makes me grue ; I cannot abide her and her nonsense.\" At Sibbie's words there was a startled pause even in that prejudiced assembly, a puzzled wonder whether there might not be reason in what the witch-wife said. The next group which appeared to confront and subvert Sibbie was of a different class from those witnesses who had gone before. It was composed of the unmarried daughters of a neighbouring laird, and it was with some faint sense of having degraded themselves by treading in the footsteps of the vulgar, in con sulting the witch-wife on a domestic trouble,"], [232, "228 THE WITCH-WIFE that the cluster of big-boned, sandy-haired women of uncertain age came forward to give evidence. But various motives prevented them from being too affronted to add their testimony to the heterogeneous mass of fact and fiction already laid before the Presbytery. The ladies' self-complacency had been wounded in their encounter with Sonsie Sibbie. They honestly believed that one of them had been in grave danger. They were eager to tell their tale, in order to excite such sympathy and interest as would counterbalance the consciousness of what had been blamable and unbecoming in their act. They would like to be heroines in their own persons. Besides, the ladies' minister \u2014 and common rumour had it that Mistress Molly Fernie would have no objection to becoming mistress of the manse of Duthie by marrying the bachelor minister \u2014 had told them it was nothing short of their duty to put force on their modesty and delicacy of nature for the purpose of corrobo rating the narratives of the humbler witnesses. It would atone in some sort for the error of which they had been guilty in applying for advice and assistance to such an unwarrantable quarter. Therefore it was with a curious blending of mortification and pride that the sisters, in their silk hoods, and fine cloth capes"], [233, "SIBBIE BEFORE THE PRESBYTERY 229 and skirts, told their story amidst breathless silence and attention on the part of the com pany. They had been vexed in their minds about certain gossip which had reached them regarding an aged kinsman whose relations with his kindred had been far from satisfac tory, while he was now lying in sore sickness at some distance from those who were his best friends, and he was liable to be tampered with by designing persons for their own ends. The question was whether a will he had once made in the ladies' favour was still in exist ence, or whether it had been destroyed, and another written in which there was no mention of his defrauded kinswomen's names. Greed and worldly-wise concern for their own inter ests had aroused much anxiety in the minds of the would-be legatees. They had been advised by foolish counsellors to resort to the witch-wife and try if she could tell them what would happen, and afford them guidance in the difficult circumstances. In the simplicity of their sex and gentle breeding \u2014 the speakers and their supporters made much of this quality supposed to distinguish these better -class clients of Sibbie's, though their silly, sly faces, full of credulity and craft, gave the lie to the attribute \u2014 the ladies adopted the suggestion made to them. The gist of the"], [234, "THE WITCH-WIFE 230 transaction was that Mistress Molly, Mistress Euphame, and Mistress Betty Fernie had on one morning early \u2014 for they did not dare to approach the cot-house of the Snaws by night, and they naturally desired to escape observa tion \u2014 walked an unwonted distance for delicate gentlewomen, and arrived at Sonsie Sibbie's dwelling-place before the world was abroad. The visitors found the witch-wife stirring and engaged in the apparently innocent occupation of spreading linen to dry on the hedge of natural privet which bordered one side of her domain. She looked them all over with green eyes, from which they instinctively shrank. She was so rude that she did not desist from her work when they addressed her, but merely glanced over her shoulder at intervals. They informed her of their errand. For answer she said shortly, without apology, that as they were neither sick nor sorry, they were not the people to whom she could be of use. She could do nothing for them. She could not or would not tell them a syllable of their kinsman's testament. Her only word to them was that the lust of gold was a base lust, and that it was waesome when it entered into the breasts of the young \u25a0 \u2014 there she looked at Mistress Betty, who was considerably the junior of the three\u2014 for"], [235, "SIBBIE BEFORE THE PRESBYTERY 231 it would soon cast out all that was kind and loesome. Then the climax ensued when their punishment threatened to overtake the eldest of the sisters on the spot.

Sonsie Sibbie did not dare to connive at the making away of a single lady like Mistress Molly Fernie, with the hue and cry which would be raised through out the country, and the vengeance which would be exacted for the barbarous deed.

Yes, if you will have it, I was aware of the stratagem to con found all who were disaffected to the King's Government, and likewise what part the lying in-wait of the sodgers was to play in the matter.

And now her own mouth has con demned her ; for what says she in answer to the question of how came she to possess the ability to publish to the four winds the wise projects of the commander of his Majesty's forces in these parts ? First, she is speechless ; next, she owns to the ill-gotten knowledge ; but she will not, for she cannot, tell from what source it came to her. Then she raves of strange powers, and communications made to her in especial, but not vouchsafed to ordinary Chris tian mortals. \"Woman,\" he turned and ad dressed Sibbie, waving his long gaunt arms in passionate adjuration, while not a tinge of colour warmed the dead-cold white of his face, \" I call on you, in the name of the Most"], [241, "SIBBIE'S CONFESSION 237 High, to confess your guilt, your dabblings in forbidden arts, your abominable traffic with Beelzebub.\" \" I confess,\" said Sibbie slowly, with every eye fastened on her, and every breath held back lest a word of her answer should be missed, \"I'm a miserable sinner, as every soul here is, even the godly, learned gentlemen before me, in the face of Him in whose name I am conjured to speak.

The sentence completed the simili tude which had horrified him. To others it brought to mind the warning uttered for all time, that the servant is not greater than his lord, and what men have done to the master they will do to his disciple.

We must mind the gifts of healing and of the discerning of spirits, as well as the faculty of speaking with tongues, were conferred on the early Church by God, and not by the Devil.

Mr. Adam sub sided in a despairing heap, well aware as he was that his vagrant tastes were despised and disapproved of by the more strictly re ligious and professionally concentrated of his fellow-ministers. They coughed and cleared their throats with gruff significance as a token of their sympathy with the modera tor's remarks. A stalwart young figure and darkly flushed face pressed forward from the crowd choking the aisle. A little while before, Glenfierroch had"], [244, "THE WITCH-WIFE 240 writhed and ground his teeth at the slighting reference to Mistress Babie, but he had re strained himself and bided his time until he should stand up for Sibbie. \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, \" I am here to speak a word for Sibbie Bethune, whom you have arraigned as a witch. I have known her since I was a bairn, when she fostered me for years. She is an honest woman who has served her kind, no less than me and mine, faithfully. She has little de served the treatment she is receiving at your hands.\" But here his voice was drowned in a rising tumult. Representative of an old family, head of a branch of the great Drummond clan, laird of a substantial lairdship, spirited and popular young gentleman as Randy was on the whole, he had no authority, no right to speak here. He was not so much as an Elder in his parish, so as to have a voice in the kirk session, not to say the Presbytery, which was jealous for its prerogatives, not scrupling to rank them as part of the spiritual sovereignty ofthe Church's Heavenly Head. The people, as well as the Presbytery, were resentful of any meddling with ecclesiastical rights, for the Church of Scotland is democratic in its es sence, and whoever tampers with its institu tions has the nation \u2014 religious for good or for"], [245, "SIBBIE'S CONFESSION 241 evil to its core \u2014 against him. A prevailing growl of resentment and disapprobation on all sides threatened to put the intruder down. \" Glenfierroch,\" cried his minister impatiently on his side, so far forgetting his official dignity as to address the offender personally, \"you are not speaking to the point. Nobody denies that a witch may be a faithful servant to an earthly in addition to an infernal master. But woe be to the house she serves, if they give her a long tether and stick up for her in concerns which are none of theirs.\" The audience, if not the Presbytery, were wearied with the protracted sederunt. The impregnability of the Church court was a pass ing question to be asserted and dismissed, without further discussion. The real interest was centred in the witch-wife\u2014 in her guilt and in the sentence to be pronounced on her. The people had had their palates tickled, and their appetites whetted, for sensation and horror. They were not to be balked in their lawful gratification by any young jackanapes like Glenfierroch, who had attempted to cast the mantle of his rank and influence over their victim. What though Sonsie Sibbie had served the Drummonds of Glenfierroch ? The class of serving men and maids, accustomed, as their humbler compeers were wont to allege, Q"], [246, "THE WITCH-WIFE 242 to pander to the vices of the great, were not unfrequently the very class from which the devil's bondsmen and women were drawn. If the day ever came that their masters and mistresses could screen them from the punish ment of their crimes, then farewell to the cove nanted righteousness of Scotland's kirk and Scotland's nation. There were not wanting those who remembered that the last Lady Glenfierroch had hated the witch-wife, and had vowed she had changed her infant in the cradle. That was Glenfierroch's look-out, but woe to him if he identified himself with the proved sinner, Sonsie Sibbie. For the mis guided young man's sake, the sooner and the more effectually the two were separated the better. No, the lookers-on and listeners would not be deprived of the edifying spectacle of a witch's end. The recent protest against a sacrilegious invasion of the Church's rights was forgotten. A storm of rage on the part of the people swept away all obstacles and pre cedents. The sacred building rang with cries of, \" Dook the witch-wife !\" \" Burn her ! \" \" Tear her limb from limb!\" \"Let no master, young or auld, rob the Deil of his due.\" It was with the utmost difficulty that the moderator's voice could be heard above the uproar, or that, masterful as he was, he could quiet the dis-"], [247, "SIBBIE'S CONFESSION 243 turbance. It was done by quickly taking the votes of the members of the Presbytery, and causing the clerk to proclaim the result before entering it into his minutes. The resolution of the meeting was unanimous, save for two dissenting voices; the one was that ofthe Rev. Adam Rattray of the Brigton, the other be longed to another weak latitudinarian brother. Sibella Bethune, better known as \" Sonsie Sibbie,\" the \"witch-wife,\" was found guilty of damnable witchcraft. She was to be taken on the first Tuesday of this current month of November, to the Knock above the town, there to be burnt according to the customary usage with witches, in the sight of as many witnesses as cared to look on at the just retribution awarded to her wickedness. God have mercy on her sinful soul, and might the parish of Duthie, and the Church of Scotland, be then and thenceforth cleared of all com plicity with the deadly sin of witchcraft. The sentence was received with general satisfaction, though the place in which it was delivered prevented any loud expression of feeling. The church and town officers were permitted to remove the prisoner and convey her to the town jail without the rush of a rabble rout, to snatch her out of the men's hands.

It was a solitary hill or \" law,\" as such hills are some times termed in local nomenclature. When they arose near an old baronial castle or ancient burgh town, they were often utilised as seats of judgment (barons' courts), and places of execution. A survival of the uses to which they were applied lingers to this day in the terms \"Heading Hill\" or \"Hanging Hill,\" frequently given to these hills. If the Knock had ever served (which it had done, in all probability) as a Heading or Hanging Hill, the circumstance was so eclipsed by a later distinction that the earlier notoriety had come to be forgotten. It was in connection with the burning of witches, of whom Sonsie Sibbie was happily the last, that the Knock had its fame. The association was even eerier than that which belonged to headings and hangings,"], [250, "246 THE WITCH-WIFE and that was held in common with other hills. But the imaginations of the natives, in the days when men and women were hardened to horrors, existed under strict control. Idle fancies did not play their owners such tricks as to spoil for the dwellers in the vicinity the charm of the Knock. As Sibbie had reminded, Glenfierroch bairns were carried up there to profit by the brisk and bracing air ; lovers held their trysts there ; and old men, leaning on their staffs, climbed the path for the last time to look out on the world which the climbers were about to leave, as freely as if no witches had been offered there in sacrifice to a fantastic superstition. But the ordinary peregrinations to the Knock were made in the time of prim roses, in the time of roses, or in the time of ripe hazel-nuts and blackberries. It was not in any of these times that the witch-wife went to her doom. A dim, wan day in November, when the trees were stripped bare, the bracken was rusty, the brambles showed thorny spikes without lilac bud, white blossom or purple fruit, without even shrivelling leaves brushed with crimson. The Duthie, flowing through the strath, could only be recognised by rolling wreaths of white mist.

It was the natural rampart which guarded the green pastures with their herds and flocks, and the red ploughed land that in summer would wave with golden grain, from the Highland caterans who neither sowed nor reaped. The foreground was sombre enough where the hodden grey of November dulled the space between the Knock and the couching hills. The day when the last witch was burnt within the bounds was neither light nor dark ; no sun shone and no rain fell. It was either absolutely still \u2014 as if nature stood hushed and awed before the deed which was to be perpetrated in her sanctuary \u2014 or gusts of wind rose and fell fitfully, sobbing and moaning through the trees and brushwood which clothed the sides of the Knock.

But there was one spectator present who did no more than hang on the outskirts of the inner ring of the people, whose reluctant feet had carried him fascinated \u2014 drawn by an influence he could not resist to where he fain would not have been. He kept as much as possible out of earshot of the bystanders, as one troubled with too late misgivings and relentings, whom their remarks, callous or brutal, would go far to drive frantic. He strove to shroud his identity by muffling him self in his cloak, and pulling his beaver over his eyes. He would even, in his desperation, have turned aside or lowered his eyes, in order not to behold the ghastly consumma tion of the day's proceedings which he had yet, as it seemed, come with the multitude to see.

But over these hos tile heads, Sibbie's eyes might detect the remoter figure hovering in the near distance, and take comfort from the fact that he was there to see the last of her, as the eyes of the dying, closing on the sights of time, seek the loved faces fast being lost to them. Alas ! alas ! it was all the poor service Glenfierroch could render Sibbie. The days were gone by when he could have assembled and armed his retainers, ridden to the rescue, and defying magistrate and minister, wrested Sonsie Sibbie from their clutches. Who, even among his household, would venture to follow him when it was a tried and sentenced witch wife who was to be saved ? At a signal Sibbie mounted the pile of fag gots, and was bound to the stake they en circled, and immediately there sprang up the first light eddies of blue white smoke, which was to increase and grow dense till it rose in a solid column, seen from all the country"], [254, "THE WITCH-WIFE 250 round. An answering thrill ran through the crowd. \" It is like the smoke of Sodom and Gomorrah,\" cried one voice. \"It is the reek of the pit,\" cried another. Glen fierroch turned furiously, and in his misery would have struck at the speaker. Then all at once Randy Drummond staggered back, his head swam \u2014 a vision as of the night returned to him. All this had hap pened to him before ; it was his second experience of the burning of a witch on the Knock above the town, amidst a surg ing concourse of spectators. It was an act of which he had witnessed the re hearsal. He knew exactly what would come next in the performance, and what would befall the principal performer. The con sciousness left him dazed and bewildered, but it also tended to calm him. Yes, here was the very weather which fitted in with his dream \u2014 the stillness which might be felt, in which not only the whispers of the people but the fall of a leaf could be heard, giving place to gusts and blasts of wind which lifted and dropped again, or bore away in the opposite direction the smoke canopy. The woman he knew, his old nurse Sonsie Sibbie, was standing raised aloft, erect, and with hands unbound. She had submitted"], [255, "THE LAST WITCH BURNT 251 without resistance to her arrest. From first to last she had refrained from the frantic, fruitless struggles to which the poor wretches \u2014 often infirm and decrepit \u2014 with whom she was supposed to count kindred in sin, had frequently yielded. Therefore the boon of remaining unpinioned had been granted to her. Every detail was graven on his brain. One hand was up fumbling with the string of lammer beads at her throat. She raised it to her lips, and bit through the thread, just as the first tongue of flame leapt up from the lit faggots. The yellow drops were strewn around her all save the big central bead, which she grasped between her thumb and forefinger, and as he was a sane man, flung with all her force in his direction.1 He did not try to catch it ; he knew he would not. The blinding smoke again en veloped her, leaving him time to recall what the bead meant to him. He had played with it as a child when it hung from Sonsie Sibbie's white firm throat. She had taken the necklace off, and showed him how to rub the beads and attract straw and feathers 1 The incident ofthe \"lammer bead\" occurred in connection with the burning of the last witch in Scotland.

When he was older she had told him how her dead man had brought the beads to her as a love gift from the far-away Northern Ocean, beneath whose cold white sands the precious gum lay in veins. She had promised him, if he were a good Lairdie, that some day she would give him the big shining bead which was his special admira tion. WThen he looked at it he would \"mind on \" her, and think of how she had bidden him be \"manful and truthful, God-fearing, diligent, and thrifty,\" in the station to which God had called him.

The smoke column wavered, was torn asunder, and carried adrift again by one of the strong currents in mid-air. The woman, who was like Sibbie, and yet of so much grander an aspect, was, as he could see, fum bling with the arms \u2014 the sleeves of her short gown left bare \u2014 which were now crossed on her breast, and in the light of the fire a trickle of blood was visible on one arm. He knew she would presently snatch a hand-"], [257, "THE LAST WITCH BURNT 253 kerchief from her breast, and press it to her face, as if to screen it from the scorching flames. He divined the action from what had happened in that true dream of his, for the smoke once more shrouded the witch -wife, and yet once more it was borne away on the wings of the soughing wind. God in heaven ! What was that amidst the red crackling fire, which was roaring in its fury and flinging fiery sparks and half-extinguished black bits of peat far and wide, so that those who were nearest recoiled and shook gowns and mantles in dread of their ignition. There stood the statue of a woman supported against the stake, her hands fallen by her side, her eyes closed, her lips growing livid. She was sleeping the profound sleep which, whether it is slept in the kindly warmth and peaceful rest of a home bed, with the watchful eye of faithful affection keeping guard on the sleeper, or in the icy cold of a snow-wreath on the hard moorland where only hill foxes wander, is the first step into the eternal silence that reigns within the portals of Death.

For who even among the learned, godly ministers or Elders was suffi cient for these things ? The dream and the reality were one, and they were ended. Glenfierroch remembered nothing more.

There was nothing to hinder it when the principals had consented and their friends were satisfied. Indeed, the three warriors would have had the occasion celebrated with the utmost honour and rejoicing. It was a mortification to them that the alliance should be shorn of any splendour of festivity and gaiety befitting the wedding. They would have stretched the slender household purse to the utmost extent, in order to accomplish their share of the expenditure becoming so auspicious an event, which, if it were to be to their loss in one sense, in another would inaugurate some of the proudest moments in their lives. But the warriors were wise greybeards ; they took matters as they found them and made the best of them. They deferred where deference was due, 255"], [260, "THE WITCH-WIFE 256 even from seniors to juniors, in an age respecting generation, since it was the juniors who were chiefly concerned about the details with regard to which there might be two opinions. If Glenfierroch and Babie chose that their marriage should be a quiet one with no flourish of trumpets, no firing of guns, no joint, dignified, prolonged dis play and loud revelry among high and low ; why then, Glenfierroch and Babie should have their way. It might be a pity not to gratify their neighbours, rich and poor, and celebrate the wedding with an dclat of magnificence and gladness which should be remembered throughout the generation. But the mode of the marriage rite, the riding to church, the welcome home, the eating and drinking, were trifles after all, and perhaps, everything considered, the young pair were right, and it was better for them to be modest and retiring, to walk softly, and draw to themselves no special attention which might recall untoward circumstances. Randy Drummond and Babie seemed to have changed places and characters in their attitude towards each other within these recent months. It was not that he was no longer a fond and eager wooer, but that in the shocks he had undergone, and in the vary-"], [261, "GLENFIERROCH A FUGITIVE 257 ing moods which he had difficulty in shaking off, he had grown suddenly sedate and self restrained, older by years than he had been when he had first come to Balduthie court ing Bonnie Babie in the previous summer, and had been at the mercy of her gibes and flouts. And Babie, who had been so wilful and coy, a very spirit of mischief, mocking and teasing her sorely tried lover, could not go far enough now in meeting his wishes and seeking to please him. She was as gentle and yielding in these latter days as she had been hard and scornful, proud and resisting, in the beginning. It was as if she were always seeking to comfort him for some grief of which he spoke rarely, to heal by her love, grown generous in its kindness, the wound which had pierced his heart. The new year was to bring a new life, a double life to Glenfierroch, in place of the old lives which were still severed, though the lovers met every day. That double life, with its fresh duties and pleasures, would make up for the suffering of the past. Its light \u2014 broad, healthy, sane \u2014 would chase away the night-shadows which were gone and done with, but that still cast their reflection over a sensitive spirit. R"], [262, "THE WITCH-WIFE 258 The last night of the old year has always been a memorable night in Scotland, and this year it was doubly memorable at Balduthie. It was Babie's \"last night of the year\" in her old home which she had gladdened, the last occasion of her wielding at Balduthie the housewifely authority which she had assumed with such bold, light-hearted, girlish alacrity. But any regrets which she and her uncles might feel for the termination of her reign were chastened and subdued regrets. For her, she was wanted at Glenfierroch, and she was ready to be gone where Randy Drum mond wanted her. For her uncles, though her place at Balduthie might be left deso late, they would see her at the head of Glen fierroch's table, opposite a callant who doted on her, and was worthy of her, filling with grace and state an honourable seat which any gently born lass in Perthshire might have been well content to occupy. What more could the warriors ask for their darling or for themselves in their declining years ? There was, therefore, no need either for the mistress or the masters of Balduthie to damp the spirits of their retainers, who on this night of all nights were daft with the joy of hogmanay \u2014 the delight of \" first-foot ing,\" and of hospitably entertaining each his"], [263, "GLENFIERROCH A FUGITIVE 259 or her friend or lad, who came over in a jovial band to wake up the echoes of night and darkness, and partake of kail-brose, Glen livat, home-brewed wine, diet-loaf, and short bread, as tastes varied.

He must come again before the small hours, that the two might drink together of the cream of the well, and share the more intoxi cating beverage of the first kiss of the new year.

She was making some piece of finery, a trifle of lace and riband with which she might busk herself, in order to look fairer in the eyes of her lover when he came abroad to seek her, among the troop of gallants, old and young, scouring the country-side in the mirk and chill of this 31st of December, the blithest night in all the calendar.

She shook her head and smiled over the recollection. What a con ceited goose she had been! How had he borne it? and how could she have been so left to herself as to question that there was no young \"spark\" in Scotland like him, and that she had cared for him more than for the whole world besides, ever since the time that their eyes first met. The Major, the Commodore, and the Lieutenant were gathered by the fire re calling former hogmanays and recounting their incidents. It was like and yet unlike that other evening in the autumn when Glenfierroch and Babie strolled together in the fruit-laden garden and held the confabu lation which was of grave import to them and to more than them. That autumn gloaming had been a prelude to trouble and disaster ; but the striking of the hour which signalled the end of glad hogmanay, and the dawning of a new year, with its chances, promises, and hopes, was to be to Randy Drummond and Babie a foretaste of wedded bliss.

Surely it was not good luck so to anticipate the time of greeting. It was a result which might have been expected, that the top-knot should remain unfinished, and stare at Babie reproachfully every time she came across the token, for many a day. And why did the coming bridegroom hurry into the hall with a wild, half-dis traught air, as he had not looked since the dreary day on which the last witch had been burned within the bounds. He walked straight to Babie and stood in the little circle of yellow light which her cruizie made, while the warriors by the hearth \u2014 their weather-beaten faces lit up by the red glow from the peat fire \u2014 paused in their tales and looked round in astonishment to hear the reason of the premature intrusion. He told it to them as well as to Babie when he burst out in a strained, harsh voice : \" I am undone, Babie. There is a warrant out against me issued by the Secretary of State, and certain to be here by the end of the week at furthest.

It had pro voked them to recall former amnesties and take the vengeance which had lain in abeyance for acts, the actors in which had been suffered to believe they were forgotten and forgiven. At the date when the Earl's Hunt was pro jected, a paper containing a list of the names of the members most committed to a rising had fallen into the hands of the authorities, and been warily kept by them after the affair had collapsed, as a useful weapon in case of further disaffection.

They went so far as to ignore their com missions in the services, and the strenuous loyalty bound up with them.

This was a case in which stern justice might well be tempered by mild mercy with out any blame to the judges. The four gentlemen conversed together on the subject of Glenfierroch's flight, the seniors with animation and interest, the young man listlessly and hopelessly. The warriors had in their day been accustomed to many a sudden start and forced retreat.

Even though the marriage had been an accomplished fact, Babie could not have ac companied Glenfierroch on his journey. In days of difficulty and hardship, even to those travellers who were not hounded on by a warrant to apprehend them dogging their steps, it was not to be thought of that a young, tenderly nurtured woman should en counter the privations under which hardy men sometimes sank. \" Babie,\" said Glenfierroch, out of the depths of his gloom, \" our contract of marriage which was to have been fulfilled this day fortnight is broken off \u2014 snapped asunder like a sap less dead bough, as if we had never loved each other, never borne trouble for each"], [269, "GLENFIERROCH A FUGITIVE 265 other, never been within an ace of spending the rest of our days in each other's company.\" \"We will be wed before you go,\" spoke up Babie, with a sudden inspiration of courage and devotion. \"What is to hinder us?

Were they to change their faces when his prosperity had fled, show him the cold shoulder in his adversity, and deny him the wife whom they had well-nigh flung at his head, now that Babie was eagerly con senting ?

Babie could no longer play her part in it, since in the straitened means which had become her experience and that of her surviving uncle, all the household work which could not be undertaken by the Major's old soldier servant-of-all-work, the sole domestic who could still be afforded, devolved on the mistress of the establishment. Still, the Major, in his patched as well as faded military coat, preserved unimpaired the bearing and spirit of a gentleman.

She had"], [276, "THE WITCH-WIFE 272 craved to see again the place whose tragedy had stamped an indelible impression on her imao-ination. For Glenfierroch, who would have died or gone mad if he had not confided the tale to her ears, had related to her his dream and its fulfilment. She climbed the hill, which was now full of sweet sights, scents, and sounds. The spikes of the whin were rich in blossom, pale golden and apricot-scented ; the deeper yellow tassels of the broom were beginning to unfold. White wild anemones and lilac streaked wood-sorrel, with primroses innumer able, starred the banks. Ground ivy, with its veined leaves and purple blossoms, almost lost in a blue mist of hyacinths, forced an outlet through the carpet of decaying leaves under foot. Birds sang to their mates building in the trees and bushes. Squirrels hopped from bough to bough. Away between the boles of the trees could be seen the green strath, the rushing Duthie, and still farther off the grand outline of the deer-forests \u2014 a delicate blue in the spring sunshine, with patches of stain less white where the winter snows still lingered in the corries on the sides of the mountains. Babie walked slowly ; time did not fail her, and she was a little short of breath, as the natural accompaniment of the slightly pinched"], [277, "BABIE FINDS SIBBIE'S BEAD 273 look in the face which was still young, though girlhood had passed into womanhood. The human bud had opened into a flower, a some what worn flower at its present stage, but infinitely sweeter, infinitely more precious in its growth than the bud in its promise. The merry black eyes were soft and thoughtful. The rosy brown of the cheeks, where there were palpable hollows instead of smooth round ness, was still healthy in tint, because of an occupied mind and abundance of physical exer cise, but the tint as well as the moulding was subdued. The curly hair, with whose straying locks the lightest wind used to toy, under the snood which vainly sought to keep them in order, was not permitted to do more than wave, like poor Sibbie's hair under the white coif \u2014 a substitute for the matron's curch \u2014 beneath the black hood. The gay, mocking girl was dead and gone ; in her room was the patient, diligent woman, grave if still humorous, under her gravity, wise, true, and tender to the core. Babie thought, as she neared the summit of the Knock, of that other woman who, whatever her power, however derived, had been the most loyal of friends to Glenfierroch, the most generous of enemies to Babie. Here Sonsie Sibbie had died through her regard s"], [278, "THE WITCH-WIFE 274 for Randy Drummond and Babie, not less than for her own offences. Up yonder in the midst of the devouring fire, a marvel, which would be spoken of for more than one generation, had been wrought on the witch-wife. She had slept profoundly amidst the scorching flames, she had been converted into a deathly image of rest in the very hour of her torture. She had passed away untormented in the presence of her execu tioners, and no man could tell whether it had been the Devil and his fiendish crew, or God and all good angels, who had shielded her and carried her unharmed beyond the shores of time. It was not even her sentient body which was tortured ; it was only the ashes of which it had been composed that were cast to the four winds. As Babie pondered, something caught her eye which was neither flower \u2014 neither \"lucken gowan \" (globe flower), nor celandine, nor bur nished leaf ; something which, though earth stained, still glittered where it lay, nearly hidden between a tree root and a fragment of rock. She stooped and scooped it out. It was Sibbie's big lammer bead, of which Babie had heard. Sibbie had flung it in her last conscious moments to her foster-son. It was the bead Lairdie had looked at in his"], [279, "BABIE FINDS SIBBIE'S BEAD 275 childhood, which Sibbie had promised to give to him, telling him that if he kept it for her sake, and remembered, as he gazed into its clearness, how she had charged him to be \"truthful and manful, God-fearing, diligent, and thrifty,\" the world would go well with him and his, and when he was done with it a better world would be his portion. It was the witch -wife's lammer bead, which had lain through winters' snows and summers' heat, trodden on by many a careless foot, overlooked by many a careless eye, kept to be found by Glenfierroch's wife, of all people. Was it a good omen ? Babie asked herself wistfully, as she stood and looked at the token lying in the work-worn little hand, on the third finger of which the wedding-ring hung loosely. Ah no ! that was an idle freit. Never theless, she wiped the bead with reverent care, put it away in her housewife's pocket, and took it home to be cherished among her treasures. These were Glenfierroch's letters ; the valentine he had sent her, which she had not deigned to admire ; the little mirror in filigree he had brought her from St. John stoun's fair, which she had made a point of transferring to the Major for him to shave by."], [280, "CHAPTER XX WHEN DUTCH WILLIAM CROSSED THE SEAS Not on the very day or at the exact hour and moment when Babie found Sonsie Sibbie's lammer bead, which would indeed have been a striking coincidence, but in the gloom of the November of the same year, Dutch William sailed into Torbay. He took the road to London, and entered St. James's Palace, from which James the Second of England had fled before an outraged Protestant people and a daughter. Her faith and fortunes were those of her husband, the silent, ailing, dauntless man who, after the death of Gustavus Adolphus, was the champion of Protestantism in Europe, and had met and defeated the veteran armies of the great Louis. News were long of travelling, even within the borders of one small island, in those days. Perhaps it was as well, since the Major, the sole remaining warrior of Balduthie, old and feeble as he was, might have woke up to the sound of the trumpet like any ancient, 276"], [281, "WHEN WILLIAM CROSSED THE SEAS 277 battered war-horse, and limped painfully off to offer the sword his trembling arm could hardly wield to his anointed King. But the contest was evaded \u2014 save for the death flash of Claverse at Killiecrankie, which the Major's friends succeeded in keeping concealed from him \u2014 before the word of the unresisted invasion, and the well-nigh bloodless substi tution of William and Mary for James Stewart, reached Balduthie. The tidings, when they did come, were brought by a broad-shouldered, stalwart man in his prime. He had ridden the good horse he was wont to spare into a foam of sweat and mire before he drew bridle at the gate of the old tower of Balduthie, leapt off, and tramped in without \"tirling at the pin\" or so much as saying \"By your leave.\" The astonished occupants of the hall were the Major, with his shrunk frame wrapped in his old military cloak, and his wrinkled hands held out to the fire burning low on the hearth, and a woman still young enough to bloom again, but now faded and almost spent by the long and weary road she had been travel ling. She was trying to finish some needle work by the failing light in the deep recess of one of the windows. Her eyes could no longer see her thread ; but in the space of a"], [282, "278 THE WITCH-WIFE second, at the distance of the door, she recog nised the unannounced visitor, who passed quickly by the Major and came straight to wards her. She did not run to meet him, her limbs trembled too much. It was he who caught her in his sheltering arms and strained her to his bounding heart, then holding her at a little distance from him, devoured her features with fond, faithful eyes, growing dim as they gazed. \" The waiting is at an end, Babie,\" he cried. \" I am here, never to go away again, unless with you by my side. The outlawry and the forfeiture are both re moved by my King, our King, who will maintain our covenants, uphold the kirk, and judge the people with righteous judgment. The time for silks and velvets which you spoke of when I went, is here. You've long mourned in dule and hardship \u2014 why was I not telled? But the Lord be thanked, the days of your mourning are ended. You'll be the Lady of Glenfierroch at last. You'll want for naught that I can give you \u2014 your every wish shall be gratified, my sweetheart, my wife.\" \" O Randy Drummond ! I have you back, I want nothing besides,\" sobbed Babie. But as the next wish of her heart, the Laird persuaded the Major to leave Balduthie"], [283, "WHEN WILLIAM CROSSED THE SEAS 279 and go with his niece and her husband to Glenfierroch. There he had the delight of seeing his little Babie, as he had beheld her in his mind's eye years and years before, pre siding in state and bounty, with her husband by her side and her children at her knee, Glenfierroch's mistress and queen. Sonsie Sibbie's lammer bead was stored in the Laird's bureau, where it met his eye and recalled the remembrance of the donor each time he raised the lid. He did not shun the sight and the association. Gener ally, he regarded the relic with affectionate, contented eyes. He had learned its lesson \u2014 the witch-wife's lesson. He was \"truthful, manful, God-fearing, diligent, and thrifty,\" a respected and happy man in his generation. His neighbours, high and low, to whom he was an example and a stay, had long ceased to reproach him, in country gossip or in their inmost thoughts, with being the foster-son of a witch-wife. Still more entirely was it for gotten, even by Babie herself, as he knew, that there had once been a wild rumour of a witch at Balduthie \u2014 a witch in the person of young Babie Drummond, his bonnie Babie. Who could believe it of the brisk and buxom matron, so motherly in her briskness, the guiding spirit of the house?"], [284, "THE WITCH-WIFE 280 Only sometimes, as Glenfierroch's eyes rested on the lammer bead, he fell into a troubled mood, in which he struggled with the burden of faculties that were beyond his comprehension and control. But mostly he walked in the common light of ordinary day, willing and pleased to be like other men. He was not wiser with an occult wisdom, which would have dug a gulf between him and them, even between him and Babie the wife of his bosom, between him and the children he had held in his arms, the boys he had taught to ride and shoot and fence, the girls whose merry chatter cheered him, who sang pensive songs to him in the pensive gloaming. It was his pride and joy to think the boys and girls would fill his place and Babie's place in the house of his fathers \u2014 and in honourable houses similar to that of Glenfierroch \u2014 when the elders had passed behind the veil where mysteries cease.
