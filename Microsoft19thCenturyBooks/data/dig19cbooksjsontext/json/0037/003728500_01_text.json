Ever since the outbreak of the war, the country has been full of painful rumors concerning the treat ment of prisoners of war by the rebel authorities. Every returned prisoner has brought his tale of suf fering, astonishing his neighborhood with an account of cruelty and barbarity on the part of the enemy. Innumerable narratives have also been published and widely circulated. The public have been made very uneasy by these reports. One class have accepted them as true; another have felt them to be exaggerated; still another have pronounced them wholly false, fictions purposely made and scattered abroad to inflame the people"], [34, "20 REPORTS OF REBEL CRUELTY. against their enemies, and doing great injustice to the South. On the other hand, rumors have crossed the border, of an outraged public sentiment in the South, pre cisely on the same account : reports abounding there of cruelty and barbarity to the rebel soldiers in our hands. It has been repeatedly announced that what ever restrictions or privations have been suffered by Northern men in Southern prisons, were in retaliation for these. In the beginning of such a prodigious contest, as this has proved to be, breaking out in the midst of a people unaccustomed to war, and quite removed from extensive military traditions and examples, it was natural that many irregularities should have occurred, and many usages of warfare been disregarded on both sides ; and that in the matter of prisoners especially, where either region was suddenly inundated by many thousands, great abuses should have taken place, until accommodations could be provided and arrangements perfected. But these early days of ill-preparation have long passed away. The war has lasted more than three years. Both sections have become accustomed to it, and are familiarized with the ideas, habits and laws of military life. The passionate fury of one side and the patriotic indignation of the other, have had time to settle down, at least so far as to accept this condi tion, and make every civilized provision known in"], [35, "WRETCHED CONDITION OF THE RETURNED CAPTIVES. 21 modern warfare, for the mitigation of its horrors and inhumanity. And yet the painful rumors, so rife at the outbreak of the war, instead of subsiding with its early tumult, have lately increased to an extent which has seriously alarmed and aroused the public. The tales of cruelty and suffering have become even more heart-rend ing. Months ago we heard reports that our men were starving and freezing in the Southern prisons. In the late temporary resumption of the cartel, boat loads of half-naked living skeletons, foul with filth, and covered with vermin, were said to have been landed at Annapolis and Baltimore. Men, diseased and dying, or physically ruined for life, unfit for fur ther military service, had been received in the stead of soldiers of the enemy returned in good condition, and who had been well fed, well clothed, and well shel tered by our government during their captivity. But many reasons were circulated to account for such a difference. It was alleged that these emaciated men were the victims of camp dysentery, or similar distempers, and of food, which, however good in quality and sufficient in quantity, was averse to the Northern constitution. Again it was alleged that the rebel army was, itself, suffering for want of food and clothing, and that the very guards to these prisoners had fared no better. There were many among us who were willing to credit any statement which would mitigate or"], [36, "22 APPOINTMENT OF THE COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY. excuse the infamy of permitting such a condition of things. For the sake of humanity and the American name, they hoped that the worst could not be proved. But there were others to whom the proof was sufficient, and who were convinced that the whole was a horrible and pre-determined scheme, contrived for the purpose of depleting our armies, and dis couraging our soldiers. The attention of Congress was roused, and a com mittee was appointed to investigate this, and other alleged barbarities. Their report has just been pub lished. Before, however, the result of their inquiries was known, the United States Sanitary Commission, as the organ of popular humanity and philanthropy, deter mined to make an independent investigation, and such a one as would, if possible, put the question at rest on all points upon which the public mind was divided or unsettled, and furnish information so full, and so direct from original sources, that every one could arrive at a just conclusion. They accordingly appointed the undersigned as a Commission of Inquiry, partly because they were known to be removed from any political affiliations and prejudices, and partly because three of their num ber were supposed to be professionally competent to read the unerring testimony of nature in the physical condition of the men."], [37, "MANNER OF THE INVESTIGATION. 23 Two distinct departments of evidence were thus opened. In entering upon their duties the Commissioners had no other wish than to ascertain the truth, and to report the facts as they were. For this they endeavored to collect all the evidence within their reach, and to hear and record all that could be said on every side of the subject. They were accompanied by a United States Commissioner, and in every case the testimony was taken on oath or affirmation before him, or, in his absence, before other officers equally empowered. The mass of evidence, printed as an Appendix, was collected during a period of several months, and is now arranged and classified to facilitate the reader's reference. If it had been printed in the order in which it was taken, it would have been too irregular and apparently heterogeneous to have exhibited the total result of the investigation. But, as it now stands, it will be found united and homogeneous enough in the tragical story which it tells, without variation of* self-contradiction, to the country and to the world. Much of the evidence, however, is made up ot bare abstracts of the free and full conversations that were held with the persons examined, and although all the essential facts are preserved, yet many graphic and pathetic minor details are omitted which escaped, or could not enter, the formal record, but sometimes"], [38, "24 VISIT TO ANNAPOLIS AND BALTIMORE. were noted down by those who were present. Besides this, the Commissioners were witnesses them selves, and saw and heard enough to overwhelm them with astonishment, and remove the last doubt from their minds. For this reason, and that the reader may share with them, so far as can be, the almost dramatic development of the inquiry, they send out these pages, not in the form of a brief documentary report simply referring to the testimony, but as a descrip tive narrative, in which all the salient points of the evidence, and the results of their own observation, are incorporated together. Such a narrative need be only an intelligible grouping of material \u2014 its facts will speak best for themselves. The Commissioners, at the very outset, were brought face to face with the returned captives. They first visited the two extensive hospitals in An napolis, occupying the spacious buildings and grounds of the Naval Academy and St. John's College, where over three thousand of them had been^brought in every conceivable form of suffering, direct from the Libby Prison, Belle Isle, and two or three other Southern military stations.* * The Commissioners would acknowledge the courtesy and hospi tality of the accomplished and efficient Surgeon in charge of the Hospital at the Naval Academy, Dr. VanderKieft, by whom every facility for conducting the inquiry was heartily given."], [39, "25 LIVING SKELETONS. They also visited the West's Buildings Hospital and the Jarvis General Hospital in Baltimore, where several hundreds had been brought, in an equally dreadful condition. The photographs of these diseased and emaciated men, since so widely circulated, painful as they are, do not, in many respects, adequately represent the sufferers as they then appeared. The best picture cannot convey the reality, nor create that startling and sickening sensation which is felt at the sight of a human skeleton, with the skin drawn tightly over its skull, and ribs, and limbs, weakly turning and moving itself, as if still a living man ! And this was the reality. The same spectacle was often repeated as the visitors went from bed to bed, from ward to ward, and from tent to tent. The bony faces stared out above the counterpanes, watching the passer by dreamily and indifferently. Here and there lay one, half over upon his face, with his bed clothing only partially dragged over him, deep in sleep or stupor. It was strange to find a Hercules in bones; to see the immense hands and feet of a young giant pendant from limbs thinner than a child's, and that could be spanned with the thumb and finger! Equally strange and horrible was it to come upon a man, in one part shrivelled to nothing but skin and bone, and in another swollen and misshapen with dropsy or scurvy; or further on, when the surgeon"], [40, "26 EVIDENCES OF MENTAL SUFFERING. lifted the covering from a poor half-unconscious creature, to see the stomach fallen in, deep as a basin, and the bone protruding through a blood-red hole on the hip. Of course these were the worst cases among those that still survived. Hundreds like them, and worse even than they, had been already laid in their graves. The remainder were in every gradation of physical condition. Some were able to sit up, and to move feebly around their bed; others were well enough to be out of doors ; many were met walking about the beautiful grounds of the Naval Academy \u2014 by a curious and probably accidental compensation, on the part of the Government, swung to this Paradise on the Severn from the sandy little island in James River and its bleak and bitter winds. But however unlike and various the cases were, there was one singular element shared by all, and which seemed to refer them to one thing as the com mon cause and origin of their suffering. It was the peculiar look in every face. The man in Balti more looked like the man just left in Annapolis. Perhaps it was partly the shaven head, the sunken eyes, the drawn mouth, the pinched and pallid fea tures \u2014 partly, doubtless, the grayish, blighted skin, rough to the touch as the skin of a shark. But there was something else: an expression in the eyes and countenance of utter desolateness, a look of settled melancholy, as if they had passed through a period of"], [41, "27 THE HIGH CLAIM OF THE SOUTHERN PEOPLE. physical and mental agony which had driven the smile from their faces forever. All had it: the man that was met on the grounds, and the man that could not yet raise his head from the pillow. It was this which arrested the attention of some of the party quite as much as the remarkable phenomenon of so many emaciated and singularly diseased men being gathered together, all, with few exceptions, having been brought from the same prisons in the South. Every one who was questioned contributed his part to swell the following account of privation, exposure and suffering. The vail is now to be lifted from two of the nearest and most noted Southern stations for prisoners. There appear, indeed, occasional glimpses of places of cap tivity in Danville, Virginia, and Andersonville, Georgia, but the chief interest centres upon Libby and Belle Isle, 'at Richmond. Before, however, the narrative proceeds, two things must be borne in mind : First, that we are now penetrating into the arrange ments of a people who claim, and have so far main tained, their entire independence of the United States Government; who have organized a government of their own; who have also organized immense and powerful armies ; who had, in the beginning, so far prepared themselves, and, during the last three years,"], [42, "28 MODERN TREATMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR. have so far completed their preparations, as to be able to match, and all but overpower one of the strongest military establishments ever known. Let them, for the moment, be taken for what they claim to be : \" The Confederate States of America,\" a mighty government, and a \" superior race,\" first in civilization, in culture, and in courage, distinguished for all that is magnanimous, chivalric, humane, hos pitable, and noble, for all the graces and refinements, and highest developments of individual and social life. Furthermore, another thing must be borne in mind. that, in these days of civilized warfare, the cowardly and barbarous usage no longer prevails of maltreating prisoners of war, but the moment a conflict is over, every sentiment of Christianity and humanity rises to mitigate the bloody horrors of the field. The distinc tion of friend and enemy is no longer known. The surgeon, with the high sense of professional duty in which he has been educated, goes equally to all. The prisoners taken are not thrown into dungeons, nor shut up in jails, but put into barracks. They are made as comfortable as the arrangements necessary for their safe keeping will permit. They are sheltered, warmed, fed and clothed, in all necessary respects as well as the soldiers that vanquished and captured them. They become, for the time being, part of the military family of their enemy, and are made subject to the same sanitary and other regulations. Their barracks are never overcrowded; sufficient"], [43, "TREATMENT OF THE SICK. 29 area is allowed for exercise and fresh air ; so much bathing is permitted, and even insisted upon, for the sake of cleanliness ; their food is in every respect the same as that consumed by the army within whose lines they are ; their clothing is all that they need. Such a thing as robbery of their private property is unknown, or never tolerated if known. When sickness overtakes the prisoner he is removed to the hospital : taken from his bunk and placed upon a bed, and then, whatever distinction existed before vanishes entirely : every kindness and attention, every remedy and delicacy that a sufferer needs, is freely and generously given. Such is the high principle, and noble usage, which prevails in modern warfare. The perfection of its arrangements is a matter of pride and honor among soldiers, and the proper boast of every Christian gov ernment. We now turn to the people and government at present waging war with our Government, and who, through a dead-lock in the cartel, hold tens of thou sands of United States soldiers as prisoners of war."], [44, "30 II.

The first fact developed by the testimony of both officers and privates, is that prisoners were almost invariably robbed of everything valuable in their possession, sometimes on the field, at the instant of capture, sometimes by the prison authorities in a ''quasi official way,\" with the promise of return when exchanged or paroled : but which promise was never fulfilled.* This robbery amounted often to a stripping of the person of even necessary clothing. Blankets and overcoats were almost always taken, and some times other articles; in which case damaged 01 ragged ones were returned in their stead. This preliminary over, the captives were taken to prison. The Libby, which is best known, though also * No instance of the promise being kept appears in the evidence, but there have been occasions reported, though very rare, where money was returned, but even then in depreciated Confederate currency."], [45, "DESCRIPTION OF LIBBY PRISON. 31 used as a place of confinement for private soldiers, is generally understood to be the officers' prison. It is a row of brick buildings, three stori\u00b0s high, situated on the canal, and overlooking the James river, and was formerly a tobacco warehouse. The partitions between the buildings have been pierced with doorways on each story. The rooms are one hundred feet long by forty feet broad. In six of these rooms, twelve hundred United States officers, of all grades, from the Briga dier-General to the Second-Lieutenant, were confined for many months ; and this was all the space that was allowed them in which to cook, eat, wash, sleep, and take exercise ! It seems incredible. Ten feet by two were all that could be claimed by each man \u2014 hardly enough to measure his length upon ; and even this was further abridged by the room neces sarily taken for cooking, washing and clothes drying. At one time they were not allowed the use of benches, chairs or stools, nor even to fold their blan kets and sit upon them, but those who would rest were obliged to huddle on their haunches, as one of them expresses it, \" like so many slaves on the middle passage.\" After awhile this severe restriction was removed, and they were allowed to make chairs and stools for themselves, out of the barrels and boxes which they had received from the North. They were overrun with vermin in spite of every"], [46, "32 THE ROOMS OVERCROWDED. precaution and constant ablutions. Their blankets, which averaged one to a man, and sometimes less, had not been issued by the rebels, but had been pro cured in different ways; sometimes by purchase, sometimes through the Sanitary Commission. The prisoners had to help themselves from the refuse accumulation of these articles, which, having seen similar service before, were often ragged and full of vermin. In these they wrapped themselves at night, and lay down on the hard plank floor in close and stifling contact, \" wormed and dovetailed together, as one of them testifies, \"like fish in a basket.\" The floors were recklessly washed late in the after noon, and were therefore damp and dangerous to sleep upon. Almost every one had a cough in consequence. There were seventy-five windows in these rooms, all more or less broken, and in winter the cold was intense. Two stoves in a room, with two or three armfuls of wood to each, did not prove sufficient under this exposure, to keep them warm. The regulations varied at different periods in stringency and severity, and it is difficult to describe the precise condition of things at any one time, but the above comes from two officers, Lieutenant-Colonel Farnsworth and Captain Calhoun. As it happens they are representatives of the two opposite classes of officers confined in the Libby. The former coming from Connecticut, and influentially connected at the"], [47, "GUARDS ALLOWED TO SHOOT THE PRISONERS. 33 North, was one of a mess to which a great profusion of supplies, and even luxuries, were sent. The latter coming from Kentucky, and being differently situated, was entirely dependent upon the prison fare. These officers were there during the same season, but never became acquainted. The accounts of each, which will be found in the evidence side by side, are here combined and run together. From their statements it appears that the hideous discomfort was never lessened by any variation in the rules, but often increased. The prison did not seem to be under any general and uniform army regula tions, but the captives were subject to the caprices of Major Turner, the officer in charge, and Richard Turner, inspector of the prison. It was among the rules that no one should go with in three feet of the windows, a rule which seems to be general in all Southern prisons of this character and which their frequently crowded state rendered peculiarly severe and difficult to observe. The man ner in which the regulation was enforced was unjusti fiably and wantonly cruel. Often by accident, or unconsciously, an officer would go near a window, and be instantly shot at without warning. The reports of the sentry's musket were heard almost every day, and frequently a prisoner fell either killed or wounded. It was even worse with a large prison near by, called the Pemberton Buildings, which was crowded 3"], [48, "34 INSTANCES OF SHOOTING. with enlisted men. The firing into its windows was a still more common occurrence. The officers had heard as many as fourteen shots fired on a single day. They could see the guards watching for an opportunity to fire, and often, after one of them had discharged his musket, the sergeant of the guard would appear at the door, bringing out a dead or wounded soldier. So careless as this were the authorities as to the effect of placing their prisoners in the power of the rude and brutal soldiery on guard. It became a matter of sport among the latter \" to shoot a Yankee.\" They were seen in attitudes of expectation, with guns cocked, watching the windows for a shot. But sometimes they did not even wait for an infraction of the rule. Lieutenant Hammond was shot at while in a small boarded enclosure, where there was no window, only an aperture between the boards. The guard caught sight of his hat through this opening, and aiming lower, so. as to reach his heart, fired. A nail turned the bullet upward, and it passed through his ear and hat-brim. The officers reported the out rage to Major Turner, who merely replied, \" The boys are in want of practice.\" The sentry said, \" He had made a bet that he would kill a damned Yankee before he came off guard.\" No notice was taken of the occurrence by the authorities. The brutal fellow, encouraged by this impunity, tried to murder another officer in the same way. Lieutenant Huggins was standing eight feet from the"], [49, "MURDER OF A PRISONER AT DANVILLE. 35 window, in the second story. The top of his hat was visible to the guard, who left his beat, went out into the street, took deliberate aim, and fired. Provi dentially he was seen, a warning cry was uttered, Huggins stooped, and the bullet buried itself in the beams above. Very much the same thing is mentioned as happening in the prison buildings at Danville. A man was standing by the window conversing with private Wilcox. At his feet was the place where he slept at night, close under the window, and where his blanket lay rolled up. He had his hand on the casement. The guard must have seen his shadow, for he was invisible from the regular beat, and went out twenty feet to get a shot at him. Before the poor fellow could be warned, the bullet entered his fore head, and he fell dead at the feet of Iris companion. Almost every prisoner had such an incident to tell. Some had been shot at themselves a number of times, and had seen others repeatedly fired upon. One testifies that he had seen five hundred men shot at. The same brutal style of \" sporting \" while on guard, seems to have prevailed wherever the license was given by this cruel and unnecessary rule. Cap tain Calhoun, mentions that while he and his com panions were on their way to Richmond from North eastern Georgia, where they Avere captured, they stopped at Atlanta, and just before they started, a"], [50, "36 FAMINE IN LIBBY. sick soldier who was near the line, beyond which the prisoners were not allowed to go, put his hand over to pluck a bunch of leaves that were not a foot from the boundary. The instant he did so, the guard caught sight of him, fired, and killed him. Another instance of equal skill in \" shooting on the wing,\" will be noticed in the case of the soldier who only exposed his arm an instant in throwing out some water, and was wounded, fortunately not killed, by the rebel bullet. Something of the same kind was related in the course of conversation, but is not in the evidence, as happening at the Libby, when an officer was shot while waving his hand in farewell to a departing comrade. But there were cruelties worse than these, because less the result of impulse and recklessness, and because deliberately done. There opens now a part of the narrative which is as amazing as it is unaccountable. The reader will turn to the heart-rending scenes of famine which the testimony before the Commission has exposed. The daily ration in the officers' quarter, of Libby prison, was a small loaf of bread about the size of a man's fist* made of Indian meal. Sometimes it was made from wheat flour, but of variable quality. It weighed a little over half a pound. With it was given a piece of beef weighing two ounces. But it is not easy to describe this ration, it was so irregular in kind, quality and amount. Its"], [51, "37 BAD QUALITY OF THE FOOD. general character is vividly indicated by a remark made in conversation, by one of the officers : \" I would gladly\" said he, with emphatic sincerity, \"gladly have preferred the horse-feed in my father's stable.\" During the summer and the early part of the fall, the ration seems to have been less insufficient, and less repulsive than it afterwards became. At no period was it enough to support life, at least in health, for a length of time, but however inadequate, it was not so to such a remarkable degree as to produce the evils which afterward ensued. It was about the middle of last autumn that this pro cess of slow starvation became intolerable, injurious, and cruel to the extent referred to. The corn bread began to be of the roughest and coarsest descrip tion. Portions of the cob and husk were often found ground in with the meal. The crust was so thick and hard that the prisoners called it iron-clad. To render the bread eatable, they grated it, and made mush out of it, but the crust they could not grate. Now and then, after long intervals, often of many weeks, a little meat was given them, perhaps two or three mouthfuls. At a later period, they received a pint of black peas, with some vinegar, every week. The peas were often full of worms, or maggots in a chrysalis state, which, when they made soup, floated on the surface. Those who were entirely dependent on the prison fare, and who had no friends at the North to send"], [52, "38 DREAMS AND DELUSIONS OF FAMINE. them boxes of food, began to suffer the horrible agony of craving food, and feeling themselves day by day losing strength. Dreams and delusions began to distract their minds.* Although many were relieved through the gene rosity of their more favored fellow prisoners, yet the supply from this source was, of course, inadequate. Captain Calhoun speaks of suffering \"a burning sensation on the inside, with a general failing in strength.\" \"I grew so foolish in my mind that I used to blame myself for not eating more when at home.\" \"The subject of food engrossed my entire thoughts.\" \" Captain Stevens having received a box from home, sat down and ate to excess, and * The very same phenomenon occurred during the celebrated Darien Exploring Expedition, under Lieutenant Strain, some years ago. The whole party suffered starvation ; a number of them died, and the remainder were rescued when they had become emaciated and debili tated nearly to the point of death. \" From the time that food became scarce to the close, and just in proportion as famine increased, they revelled in gorgeous dinners. Truxton and Maury would pass hours in spreading tables loaded with every luxury. Over this imaginary feast they would gloat with the pleasure of a gourmand.\" \u2014 Darien Explor. Exped., Harp. Monthly, vol. x., p. 613. The party separated, Strain and Avery being the least exhausted and going on before the others to obtain succor if possible. \"At length starvation produced the same singular effect on them that it did on Truxton and Maury, and they would spend hours in describing all the good dinners they had ever eaten. For the last two or three days, when most reduced, Strain said that he occupied almost the whole time in arranging a magnificent dinner. Every luxury or curious dish that he had ever seen or heard of composed it, and he wore away the hours in going round his imaginary table, arranging and changing the several dishes.

Of these they ate ravenously until the theft was discovered. But the most unaccountable and shameful act of all was yet to come. Shortly after this general diminu tion of rations, in the month of January last, the boxes, which before had been regularly delivered, and in good order, were withheld. No reason was given. Three hundred arrived every week, and were received by Colonel Ould, Commissioner of Exchange, but instead of being distributed, were retained, and piled up in warehouses near by, and in full sight of the tantalized and hungry captives. Three thousand were there when Lieutenant-Colonel Farnsworth came away. There was some show of delivery, however, but in a manner especially heartless. Five or six of the boxes were given during the week. The eager prisoner, ex pectant perhaps of a wife's or mother's thoughtful provision for him, was called to the door and ordered to spread his blanket, when the open cans, whether containing preserved fruits, condensed milk, tobacco, vegetables, or meats were thrown promiscuously to gether, and often ruined by the mingling."], [54, "40 THIEVING OF THE BOXES. These boxes sometimes contained clothing, as well as food, and their contents were frequently appro priated by the prison officials. Lieutenant McGinnis recognized his own home-suit of citizens clothes on one of them, pointing out his name on the watch pocket. The officers were permitted to send out and buy arti cles at extravagant prices, and would find the clothes, stationery, hams and butter which they had purchased bearing the marks of the Sanitary Commission. In one instance this constant thievery became an unexpected advantage to the inmates. A.fter the famous \" tunnelling out,\" by which so many effected their escape, the guards confessed that they had seen the fugitives, but supposed that they were their own men stealing the boxes ! The tunnel, after running under the street, had its outlet near where the boxes were piled up. All through the winter and late into the spring, was this suffering, chiefly from hunger, prolonged. There is evidence of its continuance even so late as the month of May last. Surgeon Ferguson, who was confined there at that time gives a most painful picture of what he saw. \" No one can appreciate, without experience, the condition of the officers in the prison during the twelve days of my stay ; their faces were pinched with hun ger. I have seen an officer, standing by the window, gnawing a bone like a dog. I asked him, ' WThat do"], [55, "CRUEL PUNISHMENTS. 41 you do it for? His reply was, 'It will help fill up.' \" They were constantly complaining of hunger ; there was a sad, and insatiable expression of face im possible to describe.\" There is no suffering that can be mentioned greater than that of the slow and lingering pains of famine, except it be perhaps the agonies of absolute death from hunger \u2014 but of this no Libby evidence was collected. The description of Libby life might therefore end at this point so far as having reached the climax of all possible misery on the one hand, and of all possible barbarity on the other. But the testimony developes still other instances of cruelty, which may as well be introduced here, in order to show the animus of the Confederate authorities. It is stated that for offences, whether trivial or serious, the prisoners were consigned to cells, beneath the prison, the walls of which were damp, green and slimy. These apartments were never warmed, and often so crowded that some were obliged to stand up all night. It was in these dungeons that the hostages were placed. But the inhumanity was not confined to the living. It extended even to the disposal of the dead. The bodies were placed in the cellar, to which the animals of the street had access, and very often were partly devoured by hogs, dogs and rats. The officers had the curiosity to mails, the coffins in which they were"], [56, "42 DISPOSAL OF THE DEAD. carried off, to find out whether they were buried in them. But they proved to be only vehicles for bear ing them away, returning a score of times for others. This must have been the case with privates only, who occupied part of the prison, as it is mentioned that the officers generally secured by contributions, made up among themselves, metallic coffins and a decent temporary deposit in a vault for those of their number who died, until they could be removed to the North. One other incident may be noticed which is quite in keeping with all the rest, but without the foregoing catalogue of outrages to humanity, would appear too shocking to be credible. At the time Kilpatrick made his nearly successful raid on Richmond, the city was thrown into a panic by his approach, and the prison officials deliberately prepared \u2014 so the story runs \u2014 a more expeditious way of closing the career of their prisoners. It was some what more merciful than starvation, because it substi tuted instantaneous death for an endless agony of dying. The negroes gave the first intimation to the captives of what was going on* Richard Turner took care to dash the hopes of his captives, as well as add to their anxiety by informing them that \" Should Kil patrick succeed in entering Richmond, it would not help them, as the prison authorities would blow up * \" Dug big hole down dar, massa. Torpedo in dar, sure /\""], [57, "THE MINING OF LIBBY. 43 the prison, and all its inmates.\" Lieutenant Latouche was overheard observing to a rebel officer with whom he had entered the cellar, where the two hundred pounds of powder were said to be placed, \" There is enough there to send every damned Yankee to hell.' Turner himself said, in the presence of Colonel Farns worth, in answer to the question, \" Was the prison mined V \" Yes, and I would have blown you all to Hades before I would have suffered you to be rescued.'* The remark of Bishop Johns is corroborative as well as curious, in reply to the question, \" Whether it was a Christian mode of warfare to blow up defenceless prisoners ?' \" I suppose the authorities are satisfied on that point, though I do not mean to justify it.\" The idea is so monstrously shocking that Ihe mind hesitates to grasp it, or believe it. Many will try to see in it only a menace to deter any further attempt to take Richmond by a raid. And yet the evidence, even if it does come by rebel admissions, has an air of diabolical sincerity. A remark of Turner's jus tifying the act, which was mentioned to one of the commissioners, but accidentally omitted in the formal testimony, gives quite a decided turn to the very natural probability that the fiendish plan was resolved upon : \" Suppose Kilpatrick should have got in here, what would my life have been worth after you all got loose. Yes, I would have blown you all to Hades before I would have suffered you to be rescued.\" This was his argument and self-"], [58, "44 THE MINING OF LIBBY. justification in brief, though somewhat more at length at the time. The act was altogether consistent with the charac ters of the three men who had authority over the prison: \u2014 General Winder, the Commander of the Department, Major Turner, Commander of the Prison, whose brutality is fully illustrated by his management of it, and Richard Turner, Inspector of the Prison, by occupation a negro-whipper, (see the testimony of Colonel Farnsworth,) and whose savage nature vented itself in frequent acts of personal insult and physical violence toward the prisoners. Be the story true or false, it is at any rate, consum mately befitting and consistent, inasmuch as the strongest reasons for its probability may be derived from the other facts that have now been narrated. If true, it is strongly corroborative of the vindictive purpose which animates the Confederate authorities. History may yet write it so, and therefore the Com missioners do not pass it over in silence because of any doubt that may cling to it. Let the spectacle that, probably, came so near taking place, be, at least the appropriate crown and close of this portion of the narrative; the Union raiders, bounding over the fortifications of Richmond, intent upon rescuing their companions from a cap tivity worse than death, \u2014 and the three great brick buildings lifted bodily into the air, and let down in one stupendous crush and ruin upon the living forms of twelve hundred helpless men !"], [59, "45 1 1 1.

But there is a still lower depth of suffering to be exposed. The rank of the officers, however disre garded in most respects, induced some consideration, but for the private soldiers there seemed to be no regard whatever, and no sentiment which could restrain. It is to this most melancholy part of their task that the Commissioners now proceed. Belle Isle is a small island in the James river, opposite the Tredegar Iron-works, and in full sight from the Libby windows. It has pretensions enough to beauty at a distant view to justify its name, as part of it is a bluff covered with trees. But the portion on which the prisoners are confined, is low, sandy, and barren, without a tree to cast a shadow, and poured upon by the burning rays of a Southern sun. Here is an enclosure, variously estimated to be"], [60, "46 THE PRISONERS CROWDED AND SHELTERLESS. from three to six acres in extent, surrounded by an earthwork about three feet high, with a ditch on either side. On the edge of the outer ditch, all round the enclosure, guards are stationed about forty feet apart, and keep watch there day and night. The interior has something of the look of an encampment, a number of Sibley tents being set in rows, with \" streets \" between. These tents, rotten, torn, full of holes, \u2014 poor shelter at any rate, \u2014 accommodated only a small proportion of the number who were confined within these low earth walls. The number varied at different periods, but from ten to twelve thousand men have been imprisoned in this small space at one time, turned into the enclosure like so many cattle, to find what resting place they could. So crowded were they, that at the least, according to the estimated area given them, there could have been but a space two feet by seven, and, at the most, three feet by nine, per man \u2014 hardly a generous allotment even for a \" hospitable grave.\" Some were so fortunate as to find shelter in the tents, but even they were often wet with the rain, and almost frozen when winter set in. Every day some places were made vacant by disease or by death, as some were taken to the hospital, and some to burial. , But; thousands had no tents, and no shelter of any kind.

This is an established station for prisoners of war, and yet not a movement has been made, from its beginning to this moment, to erect barracks, or make any suitable and humane provisions for the comfort of those confined there. It remains to this day an open encampment, close under the walls of Richmond, and well known to the Confederate authorities, with nothing but the heavens for its canopy. Here then these thousands lay all last summer, fall, and winter, with nought but the sand for their bed, and the sky for their covering. What did they do in the summer and early autumn with the sickening heat of a torrid sun pouring upon their unprotected heads'? What did they do when the rain descended and the floods came % What did they suffer when the malarious fog enveloped them, or when the sharp winds swept up the river, and pierced their almost naked and shivering forms 1 Stripped of blankets and overcoats, hatless often, shoeless often, in ragged coats and rotting shirts they were obliged to take the weather as it came.

The winter came \u2014 and one of the hardest winters ever experienced in the South \u2014 but still no better shelter was provided. The mercury was down to zero at Memphis, which is further south than Rich mond. The snow lay deep on the ground around Richmond. The ice formed in the James, and flowed in masses upon the rapids, on either side of the island. Water, left in buckets on the island, froze two or three inches deep in a single night. The men resorted to every expedient to keep from perishing. They lay in the ditch, as the most pro tected place, heaped upon one another, and lying close together, as one of them expressed it, \"like hogs in winter,\" taking turns as to who should have the out side of the row. In the morning the row of the previous night was marked by the motionless forms of those \"who were sleeping on in their last sleep\" \u2014 frozen to death ! Every day, during the winter season, numbers were conveyed away stiff and stark, having fallen asleep in everlasting cold. Some of the men dug holes in the sand in which to take refuge. All through the night crowds of them were heard running up and down to keep themselves from freezing. And this fate threat ened them, even more than it would have threatened most men, exposed to an equally severe temperature, even with such thin clothing and inadequate shelter \u2014 -for they were starving ! The very sustenance of animal heat was withheld,"], [63, "49 THE PRISONERS RAVENOUS FOR FOOD. and one of the most urgent occasions of hunger, a freezing temperature, which makes the bodily neces sity stronger, and the appetite for food greater, was given full opportunity to make havoc among them. So the last stay and power of resistance was taken away \u2014 the cold froze them because they were hungry, \u2014 the hunger consumed them because they were cold. These twTo vultures fed upon their vitals, and no one in the Southern Confederacy had the mercy or the pity to drive them away. Only once was there heard a voice of indignant remonstrance in the rebel Con gress from a noble-hearted statesman, but it was heard with indifference, and brought about no alleviation. Read the rude words of these suffering men. Put together their testimony, and what a harrowing tale it tells ! They were fed as the swine are fed. A chunk of corn-bread, twelve or fourteen ounces in weight, half baked, full of cracks as if baked in the sun, musty in taste, containing whole grains of corn, fragments of cob, and pieces of husk; meat often tainted, suspi ciously like mule-meat, and a mere mouthful at that : two or three spoonfuls of rotten beans ; soup thin and briny, often with worms floating on the surface. None of these were given together, and the whole ration was never one-half the quantity necessary for the support of a healthy man. The reader will not be surprised to hear that the men were ravenous when the rations were brought in, i"], [64, "50 TOUCHING EXPRESSIONS OF THE SUFFERERS. nor remain unmoved by the simple and touching expressions which fell from so many of them : \u2014 \"There was no name for our hunger.\" \"I was hungry \u2014 pretty nearly starved to death all the time.\" \" I waked up one night, and found myself gnawing my coat sleeve.\" \" I used to dream of having something good to eat.\" \" I walked the streets for many a night \u2014 I could not sleep for hunger.\" \" I lost flesh and strength, and so did the others, for want of food.\" \" If I were to sit here a week, I could not tell you half our suffering \" There were other indications of the desperate famine to which they were subjected. They gnawed the very bones which had been thrown away, some times breaking them up for soup. They were glad to get the refuse bread which was occasionally thrown to them by the guards. They even ate the rats which burrowed in the encampment. A dog, belonging to an officer, straying into the enclosure was caught and secreted, and before he could reclaim his property, it was torn apart by the man who stole it, some of it eaten by himself, and the remainder sold to his comrades. So reduced were they, that they exchanged their clothing for food, and left themselves exposed the more to the cold. Under the temptation to secure"], [65, "DIRT, VERMIN, AND DISEASE. 51 double rations, many worked at their trades of black smithing and shoemaking for the rebel army. But as the weary months drew on, hunger told its inevitable tale on them all. They grew weak and emaciated. Many found that they could not walk ; when they attempted it a dizziness and blindness came, and they fell to the ground. Diarrh\u0153a, scurvy, congestion of the lungs, and low fevers set in. To add to their sufferings there came the unavoid able consequences of being herded and crowded together, but in this case especially aggravated by a most unnecessary restriction. A broad beach sur rounded the island, and yet only about seventy-five men were permitted to bathe per day in the river, in squads of five or six at a time. At this rate it was literally and almost accurately what so many of the men state : that they were allowed to wash themselves only once in six months. \"Lice were in all their quarters.\" Vermin and dirt encrusted their bodies. They were sore with lying in the sand. None, not even the sufferers with diar rh\u0153a, were allowed to visit the sinks during the night, and in the morning the ground was covered and saturated with filth. The wells were tainted; the air was filled with disgusting odors* Many were taken sick daily, but were allowed to suffer for days before they were removed to the hospi- * This taint of the drinking water was mentioned in conversation, but was accidently omitted in the evidence."], [66, "52 INHUMANITY TO THE SICK. tals, and when this was done, it was often so late that the half of them died before reaching it, or died at the very moment their names were being recorded. There was a hospital tent on the island, which was always full of the sick. It had no floor, the sick and dying were laid on straw, and logs were their only pillows. \" If you or I saw a horse dying,\" said one, \" wouldn't we put some straw under his head ! Would we let him beat his head on a log in his agony 1\" When this tent was full, the sick were taken to a hospital in Richmond. The poor creatures were often as prematurely returned, as they had been tardily removed thither. Often were they seen escorted back, so weak as hardly to be able to move, some even crawling on their hands and knees. Colonel Ely, of the 18th Connecticut saw one of his men, a former school mate and townsman, George Ward, a much respected citizen of Norwich, Connecticut, returning to the island in this condition, with a squad of others. He threw him a ham, but as the \"poor fellow crawled to get it,\" says Colonel Farnsworth, who also witnessed the sad condition of an old acquaintance, \" the rebel guard charged bayonets upon him, called him a damned Yankee, and appropriated the ham.\" An incident which happened in the very hospital from which these men were brought, will give even a better idea of how the sick were treated."], [67, "HORRIBLE CONDITION OF THE HOSPITAL. 53 Two officers made their escape. Immediately all the patients who were able to sit up or stand were taken into an empty room under the Libby, and kept there twenty-four hours, without food or blankets, as a punishment for not having reported the contem plated escape. From this treatment Surgeon Pierce died. The officers in the room above took up the floor, supplied the sick with food and drink, and shared their blankets with them. For this they were deprived by Major Turner of rations for a whole day. A still more vivid picture of a hospital interior is given by Surgeon Ferguson. It is of the notorious and horrible Hospital No. 21, where, so late as in May last, Dr. Ferguson says, \" the wounded Union prisoners were under treatment, * * * I consider,\" he adds, \" the nourishment and stimulation they re ceived entirely insufficient to give them a proper chance for recovery. I am surprised that more do not die. There were many bad cases among them that must inevitably sink under this treatment after a few days. The condition of these men was such, that any medical observer would impute it to, insufficient stimulation and nutrition. \" The bedding where the privates were confined by wounds was very dirty ; the covering was entirely, old, dirty quilts; the beds were offensive from the dis charges from wounds and secretions of the body, and were entirely unfit to place a sick or wounded man on. \"On the faces of the wounded was an anxious,"], [68, "54 HALF THE PATIENTS DIE IN THREE MONTHS. haggard expression of countenance, such as I have never seen before ; I attribute it to want of care, want of nourishment and encouragement.\" A Hospital Steward, while a prisoner, attending to some duty in the hospital, found, by accident, the Confederate Surgeon-General's quarterly report, which he brought away with him when he was paroled.

These facts are most conspicuous only because in the foreground.

The greater proportion of them were Hving skeletons, and each successive boat load was in a worse condition than the last. Hundreds, at each trip, were stretched on cots, sick with every form of disease which could have been induced by confine ment, exposure, and bad food. A number were dying ; several died before the boat landed. Every one was in a frightfully filthy condition. All were deficient in clothing.

Or why, as in one instance, (and one, under such circumstances, may be many,) did they subject them, even before they were convalescent and discharged, to such a punishment as confinement in a cell, exposure to cold, and deprivation of food? These grave developments of the testimony, by no means new to many at the North, and occasionally the subject of newspaper report, (though never in such detail as now related,) have as yet elicited no excuse or explanation ; and until an excuse or expla nation comes, the government by whom such things are authorized, and the people by whose public senti ment such things are encouraged, will stand arraigned for almost immeasurable ii^imanity and criminality before the civilized world.

Were they capable, also, not only of depriving their prisoners of their own clothing, but also of withholding the issue of sufficient to keep them warm, when the soldiers of their own army were well-equipped, and well-protected from exposure to the wet and cold ? But the inquiry cannot stop at this point. If they were capable of this, then they were capable of be holding, without compassion, their fellow beings sub jected to the worst and most lingering agonies which humanity can endure. Putting together the act, and this insensibility to its consequences, what other deduction can be drawn, than that all was a pre determined plan, origina%ig somewhere in the rebel counsels, for destroying and disabling the soldiers of their enemy, who had honorably surrendered in the field?

One fact was evident on the face of things, that no army could have endured such forced and violent marches, the fatigues and exposures of such desperate campaigning, and have kept up a spirit for such indom itable fighting, unless they had been well-equipped, and their physical condition had been maintained by every means, medical and commissary, known in a well regulated army. The rebel authorities could not afford to swell their army by conscription on the one hand, and to let the material, thus obtained, escape its military use by famine and disease on the other. The same arbitrary energy which could enforce the one, could provide against the other. Nor are the quotations of Confederate prices any criterion by which to judge. The country is rich and fertile, if the Confederate currency is inflated and poor. Every agricultural resource of a soil and climate, unsurpassed by any other in the world, has been quickened to meet the emergency. The neces sity has, also, in three years, developed other and unknown fountains of supply \u2014 all at the command of a strong, desperate, and despotic government, which has not hesitated to employ every means to keep its armies on the most perfect military footing."], [84, "70 REBEL GUARDS WELL FED. This reasoning is borne out by the facts developed in the inquiry. The testimony will be found to be quite a revelation of the rebel mode of sustaining an army and a war. Their efficiency in this respect must be admitted \u2014 an efficiency created partly by a greater aptitude and inclination for the single art of war, than for the many arts of peace ; and partly by the deadly necessity they are under for the most strenuous pos sible defence of their rebellion, on account of the ex traordinary power developed by the Government of the United States. It appears, from the testimony, that the guards of the prisoners (of whose privations so much has been said) were better supplied with food than the prisoners. The question was frequently asked, and elicited the invariable reply, that they did not share the same ration. Their supply was of a dif ferent character, and was enough. Sometimes they threw fragments of food to the hungry captives on Belle Isle. It will be remembered, that at the time the Libby prisoners were so insufficiently fed, a room in the cellar was found stocked with provisions of excellent quaUty. But no testimony on this point can be so satisfac tory as that derived from the rebel soldiers them selves. Several of the Commissioners went directly from An napolis to Washington for the express purpose of visit ing and examining the rebel prisoners. They found a"], [85, "TESTIMONY OF REBEL SOLDIERS. 71 large number at the Lincoln Hospital. Although these prisoners were suffering from wounds received in the late battles of the Wilderness and Spottsylvania, thev were in a physical condition which alone was evidence enough of the care that had been taken of them by their own government. In every case they were healthy, hardy, vigorous men. There was scarcely a trace even of the terrible fatigue they had so recently endured. Better than all, as an indication of their condition, their wounds were healing as only the wounds of men in perfect health can heal. Nine, out of the whole- number, were examined under oath. The formal testimony stopped at this number, as k was found by conversation, that all had the same account to give, and it was needless to mul tiply depositions. They came from six of the prin cipal States of the Confederacy. Two were from Virginia, two from South Carolina, two from Georgia, one from Mississippi, one from North Carolina, and one from Alabama. In order to make the inquiry more complete and satisfactory, certain members of the Commission after wards visited Fort Delaware, and the Hospital on David's Island, New York, at \u25a0 both which stations rebels were confined, and the testimony of eleven more was procured.

Any amount of such could have been procured, but that which has been taken will be found full enough. The result of the whole amounts to this : In the words of one of them \u2014 \" They had nothing to com plain of in the way of food and clothing.\" They were supplied with rations, only a few ounces less than the over-generous ration of the United States army. The quality of the rebel ration was as satisfactory to the rebels as the quantity. The corn-bread was excellent, made by themselves from fine meal. One of them naively observed that he preferred it to Northern meal ! They had never had any meal fur nished them of that quality which was ground with the cobs and husks, and in which whole grains of corn occasionally appeared. This inferior kind, they said, was \" given to stock.\" The only time in which they suffered any privation was on a forced march, when they were in advance of their supplies \u2014 a matter liable to occur in any army. In winter they lived in cabins or tents, well warmed, and well supplied with fuel. None ever suffered from the cold. In summer they were shel tered by tents, but these they left behind when on a campaign. They were fully supplied with clothing and with blankets or oilcloths. A requisition on the quartermaster could always procure any article that"], [87, "REBEL HOSPITALS FOR THEIR OWN MEN WELL KEPT. 73 was necessary. When engaged in active service, however, they carried as little as possible, only the clothes they had on and a single blanket, but no man was restricted as to the amount he might carry. It may be imagined what a condition they were in, under this system, as respects dirt, vermin, and rags, after a long campaign and a pitched battle. They describe the hospitals, both in the city and in the field, as comfortable, and with sufficient medical attendance. The bedding and sheets in Hospital No. 4, in Richmond, was said by one of them to be fully as good as those on David's Island, New York. There were also the usual delicacies for the sick. From all this, it appears that the Southern army has been, ever since its organization, completely equipped in all necessary respects, and that the men have been supplied with everything which would keep them in the best condition of mind and body, for the hard and desperate service in which they were engaged. They knew nothing of famine or freezing. Their wounded and sick were never neglected. So do the few details of fact that could be extracted, without suspicion of their object, from the soldiers of the Southern army, confirm the reasoning which accounts for its efficiency. The conclusion is inevitable. It was in the power of the rebel authorities to feed sufficiently, and to clothe, whenever necessary, their prisoners of war. They were perfectly able to include them in their"], [88, "74 ABLE TO FEED, CLOTHE, AND SHELTER PRISONERS. military establishment; but they choose to exclude them from the position always assigned to such, and in no respect to treat them like men taken in honor able warfare. Their commonest soldier was never compelled by hunger to eat the disgusting rations fur nished at the Libby to United States officers.

The amount issued being greater than a man could consume, the excess over that which was given was to go to the formation of a Prison fund, which was to be appbed in various ways, (not expressly provided for in the army regula tions,) that would promote the health and comfort of the prisoners. Army clothing was to be furnished by requisition, whenever needed, the only difference being that the buttons and trimmings were to be taken from the coats, and the skirts cut so short that the captives should not be mistaken for United States soldiers.

The Commissioners are able to testify that the order is fully carried out. They took pains not only to procure evidence as to the fact, but to see for them selves.

The wards were airy and neat, free from offensive odor, the beds so clean that the visitors sat upon them while taking testimony. The men themselves were cheerful and good-natured, the more slightly wounded crowding up curiously to know what was going on, until requested to retire. Some were sitting by their beds reading novels or odd numbers of periodicals, now and then a bible. They were always ready to con verse, and answered the questions that were put to them without hesitation. The visitors could see no difference in these two wards from the twenty or more others in the same hospital that were appropriated to the United States soldiers.

The wounds were being tenderly unbandaged and dressed by the surgeons and their assistants. Kind ness and attention were visible everywhere. Female nurses and a white-hooded Sister of Charity were constantly moving from bed to bed.

Some time after this, two members of the Com mission made an especial visit to Fort Delaware, for the express purpose of examining into the prison and hospital arrangements there, in order to give, in this narrative, their own direct testimony and description, as well as whatever evidence they might be able to collect. They fixed upon Fort Delaware because it was one of the most extensive of the United States stations for prisoners of war, and because it had been the object of various rebel reports* The following description is from notes taken on the spot by one of the party, and written out immedi ately afterward : \" The prisoners numbering between eight and nine thousand were lodged outside the walls of the fort, (which is situated on an island) in well built and ven tdated barracks, and have free access at all hours to * A recent specimen from the Richmond Dispatch, July 14th.

The same remark applies to the hospitals, which are spacious, clean, and in good order. \"When we went through the barracks, shortly before sunset, the men were generally out of doors walking about, talking, playing cards, washing, or occupying themselves in other ways.

Among these may be enumerated the want of 'vaccination, which seems to be as rare among the poorer classes of the South as it is general at the North ; the attempts made by the prisoners to vaccinate each other, which often caused disease of a dangerous type from the character of the virus em ployed ; and the bad state of the body of many of the men taken at and near Vicksburg, who were broken down by hardships and fatigues sustained before their capture, as well as by the influence of the terrible malaria of the South. \"But while the ratio of mortality among the Ameri can soldiers in the hands of the rebels has continued to augment with time, the health of the Confederate prisoners at Fort Delaware has, on the contrary, im proved under the influence of good food or kind treat ment, until in May, 1864, but sixty-two died out of eight thousand one hundred and twenty-six confined at the island. \" The cruel and unusual rule by which an approach to the windows from inadvertence, or for the most innocent purpose, is made an offence punishable with"], [98, "84 INSTRUCTIONS TO THE GUARD. death in the Confederate prisons, is, it need hardly be said, unknown in Fort Delaware.

Even then the di rection was to order the prisoner \" three distinct times to halt;\" and if he \" failed to halt, when so ordered, the sentinel must enforce his order by bayonet or ball.'' There were but five instances of shooting, under these instructions, and they were in every case in obedience to them. It is hardly worth while to notice the question whether any were shot for looking out of the windows. No such order was ever given in this, or any other United States Station. Here the windows were seen filled with the prisoners. The Commissioners are under great obligations to General Schoepf Commander of the Post, for the courtesy shown them, in personally conducting them over the station, and to the surgeons and officers in attendance, who readily furnished all the evidence that was asked for.

It will be noticed that a prison fund was formed, in accordance with the regulations, from the excess of the ration issued over the ration given, and that the amount was spent for vegetables and articles of convenience. But even with this withhold ing of part, so great was the abundance of food, that the prisoners hid loaves of bread, crackers and meat under the bunks. These were repeatedly found there in large quantities during an examination of the barracks. Captain Clark was able to save sometimes between two and three thousand dollars a month out of surplus rations, and yet every care was taken that too much was not withheld. The overseers were frequently asked if the prisoners complained of not having enough, and were ordered \"to give them more, and let no man want.\" A complaint was scarcely ever heard. It will be noticed what enormous quantities of cloth ing were issued, at this post alone, to the prisoners. In eight months over thirty-five thousand articles were distributed, comprising every species of clothing from shoes and stockings, shirts and drawers, to woolen blankets and great coats. Most of these were given on the approach of cold weather. Every one without a blanket or overcoat of his OAvn was provided with one.

The visitors no ticed in the latter, even green shades covering the windows, and a water-cooler in every ward,filled with ice, for the free use of the patients. Gen Schcepf informed the visitors that in every case of death, the body was removed to a neat grave vard on the opposite shore, and the burial service of the Episcopal church was read over the grave. It was found, by further investigation, that the arrangements of every other United States Prison Station and Hospital were the same as those of Fort Delaware. The same regulations were observed in all. The identical diet-table, containing the minute direc tions of the Surgeon-General at Washington, was hung up as conspicuously in the hospital for rebels as that for the United States soldier. The De Camp General Hospital, on David's Island, New York, was a counterpart of that just described. The testimony taken by one of the commissioners, is almost a repetition of that taken at Fort Delaware. The only variations which occur are additions to the facts already recited.

Full suits of clothing were issued to them. When the weather became cold they were removed from tents to spacious pavilions, furnished with abundant fuel. No one was ever frostbitten. None were ever shot at. They were triven the whole island inside the line of sentries for exercise. Formerly they had been allowed to go fish ing and clamming, till several escaped, when the line of sentries was placed on the beach. They had precisely the same rations as the Federal sick and wounded. Drinking water, cooled with ice, was furnished in profusion. Soap, towels, and combs were distributed for their private use. There was a nurse to every ten of them.* It will not surprise the reader to hear of the small mortality, although nine-tenths were suffering from wounds.

Whenever a death occurred, the funeral was conducted according to the form of the Episcopal church. Johnson's Island, in Ohio, has been an especial subject of rebel mis-statements. It is a pleasant, healthy spot, three hundred acres in extent, in San dusky Bay, close in the neighborhood of Kelley's Island, which is a favorite place of summer resort. The two Islands are much alike. The climate is testified to be as favorable to health as that of Newport or Saratoga in summer, or Cin cinnati and Dayton in winter. Like Fort Delaware it is a military prison and hospital. The buildings are spacious, new, and in good order. The sanitary and other regulations of similar stations are observed here in all particulars. Although in winter the weather was so cold that the lake was frozen to the main land, three miles distant, and the government teams, conveying sup plies, were able to cross upon the ice, yet so well warmed were the barracks, that not a single instance of treatment for exposure to cold was known, except, in the case of some who attempted to escape.

The statistics of mortality will be astonishing to read, after hearing the rebel stories. In twenty-one months, out of an aggregate of six thousand four hundred and ten prisoners, there were only one hundred and thirty-four deaths. The number in prison at one time never exceeded two thousand seven hun dred. In the months of May and June, last, there were about two thousand three hundred prisoners. In May five died ; in June only one ! Point Lookout was still another post which had been subjected to the rebel statement that the prisoners there suffered from cruelty and neglect. Miss Dix, who visited those very prisoners, sufficiently disposes of the slander. She says : \" They were supplied with vege tables, with the best wheat bread, and fresh and salt meat three times daily in abundant measure \u2014 the full government ration. \" In the camp of about nine thousand rebel prisoners, there were but four hundred reported to the surgeon. Of these one hundred were confined to their beds, thirty were very sick, and perhaps fifteen or twenty would never recover. \" The hospital food consisted of beef-tea, beef-soup, rice, mUk-punch, milk, gruel, lemonade, stewed fruits, beefsteak, vegetables, and mutton.

But the contrast must have been overwhelming at the point to which this narrative has now come. When the flag-of-truce boat landed within the rebel lines, the two systems confronted each other. On one side, hundreds of feeble, emaciated men, ragged, filthy, hungry, diseased, and dying ; on the other an equal number of strong and hearty men, clad in the army clothing of the Government against which they had fought, having been humanely sheltered, fed, cleansed of dirt, cured of wounds and disease, and now hon orably returned in a condition to fight that Government again.

The three points now investigated \u2014 The conclusion of the Commission- ers \u2014 These privations and sufferings were designedly inflicted \u2014 The late appeal to Divine and human judgment upon their cause by the i-ebel government \u2014 The spirit of that cause identical with the spirit which originated and defends it. Such are the facts which have been brought to Ught by the inquiry of the Commissioners. There were three points before them to be inves tigated. They were requested to ascertain \" the true physical condition of the prisoners recently discharged by exchange from confinement at Richmond and else where.\" They were also requested to ascertain whether these prisoners \"did in fact, during such confinement, suffer materially for want of food, or from its defective quality, or from other privations and sources of disease.\" This duty has been performed, and the result is now before the public. There was one other point which the Commis sioners were requested to make clear : \" Whether the privations and sufferings of the prisoners were designedly inflicted on them by military or other"], [106, "92 WERE THESE CRUELTIES INTENTIONAL? authority of the rebel government, or were due to causes which such authorities could not control.\" This question has already been alluded to digres sively, but its full answer properly belongs to this stage of the narrative, when the whole field of the investigation is before the reader. The feeling lingered in the minds of the Commis sioners as the investigation went on, that this dreadful condition of things might be attributable to even other causes than the possible destitution of the rebel government. This latter consideration, it will be remembered, was at an early moment, entirely disposed of. Any unconscious or unintentional form of crime is less reprehensible than that which is knowingly or deliberately committed. The question therefore suggested itself whether all this might not have been owing to the negligence and incompetence incident to an immature social system, or to the thoughtlessness of a reckless people, or to the misman agement of an improvident government. This was the only alternative, and was sufficiently discreditable. But it was altogether more probable that a whole people and government could unite in being thoughtlessly and inconsiderately cruel, than consciously and purposely so. The latter was something too revolting to be entertained or believed. The whole current of public feeling and public principle generated by the spread of Christianity, and the progress of civilization, is so averse to anything of the kind"], [107, "THE REBEL PRISON AT TYLER IN TEXAS. 93 that the majority of people are made almost incapable of comprehending, or even imagining such a state of mind in any community. And yet it is to this very conclusion that every one must come who carefully weighs the testimony. Every doubt and misgiving successively disappears. No other theory will cover the immensity and variety of that system of abuse to which our soldiers are subjected. That abuse is, in all its forms, too general, too uniform, and too simultaneous to be otherwise than the result of a great arrangement. One prison-station is like another \u2014 one hospital re sembles another hospital. This has been made especially apparent by intelligence that has reached the public just as this investigation is closing, and this report is being written. The remote prison at Tyler, in Texas, sends out a tale of suffering identical with that described in these pages. It was only a few weeks ago, that the streets of New Orleans beheld a regiment of half-starved and half-naked men, who had just been released from that station. Still more heart-rending is the later account, given in a memor ial to the President, from Andersonville, Georgia, and in the full description, verified on oath, of what is now being suffered there by the imprisoned sol diers of our army. It would appear to be Belle-Isle five times enlarged, and ten-fold intensified.

Here the prisoners suffer not only the privations already mentioned, but others peculiar to circum stances of a worse description.* In this pestilential prison they arc dying at the rate of one hundred and thirty a day, on an average ! The Commissioners allude to this station not as part of the evidence taken by themselves, but as an interesting, authentic, and corroborative illustration of the point now under consideration. It is the same story everywhere: \u2014 prisoners of war treated worse than convicts, shut up either in suffo cating buildings, or in outdoor enclosures, without even the shelter that is provided for the beasts of the field ; unsupplied with sufficient food ; supplied with food and water injurious and even poisonous ; compelled to live in such personal uncleanliness as to generate vermin ; compelled to sleep on floors often covered with human filth, or on ground saturated with it ; compeUed to breathe an air oppressed with an in tolerable stench ; hemmed in by a fatal dead-line, and in hourly danger of being shot by unrestrained and brutal guards; despondent even to madness, idiocy and suicide ; sick of diseases, (so congruous in char acter as to appear and spread like the plague,) caused by the torrid sun, by decaying food, by filth, by vermin, * For the full account see Supplement, page 259."], [109, "95 PRIVATIONS AND SUFFERINGS DESIGNEDLY INFLICTED. by malaria, and by cold ; removed at the last moment, and by hundreds at a time, to hospitals corrupt as a sepulchre, there, with few remedies, little care and no sympathy, to die 'in wretchedness and despair, not only among strangers, but among enemies too resent ful to have pity or to show mercy. These are positive facts. Tens of thousands of helpless men have been and are now being disabled and destroyed by a process as certain as poison, and as cruel as the torture or burning at the stake, because nearly as agonizing and more prolonged. This spectacle is daily beheld and allowed by the rebel government. No supposition of negligence, or thoughtlessness, or indifference, or accident, or inefficiency, or destitu tion, or necessity, can account for all this. So many and such positive forms of abuse and wrong cannot come from negative causes. The conclusion is unavoidable, therefore, that \" these privations and sufferings\" have been \"designedly in flicted by the military and other authority of the rebel government,\" and cannot have been \" due to causes which such authorities could not control.\" Further than this, the Commissioners are not re quired to express an opinion. Whether or not they are the result of an infuriated and vindictive ani mosity against the Federal government and people, or the result of a.pre-determined policy, deliberately formed, to discourage and affright our soldiers, to"], [110, "96 NO ABUSES SANCTIONED BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. destroy them, or to disable them for further military service, or to compel our Government to an exchange on other than the terms to which it is in honor and by necessity committed, the public are in a position to decide. The Commissioners have now performed their pain ful task. It has not been a grateful duty to narrate facts so unworthy of any people, especially of one heretofore so highly respected, so much admired, and in so many respects a credit to the American name. That name is shamed and dishonored by their exposure. But there is one source of pride and congratulation: \u2014 that, whatever abuses may have been developed on the Northern side of this war, none of them were origi nated or sanctioned by the government. In every case they have been the impulsive acts of subordi nates here and there \u2014 and such are incident to any conflict. The noble and magnanimous manner in which the government treats the enemies to its peace and prosperity, when they have become helpless prisoners in its hands, is, alone, a sufficient manifestation of the spirit which animates it in waging this war. No sentiment of anger or resentment has actuated it from the beginning. The condition of its prison stations and hospitals is the best and proudest exponent of the cause of humanity which it seeks to maintain. This praise will be awarded it by the historian and by"], [111, "THE SOCIAL CAUSE OF SOUTHERN INHUMANITY. 97 posterity, when the story of this stupendous struggle shall be written.

It will in that day be known whether the spirit which animates the South is, not also the spirit which has generated the cause of the South. The spirit which animates a cause, gives the character to that cause. A people, like an individual, is estimated by its actions and by its motives. Perhaps the world will yet discover a strange and reciprocal working of influences in the production of that which now opposes the republican progress of this government. Perhaps the social theory, already so widely accepted, may yet be fully established, which attributes the alienation of the Southern people to a simple difference of feeling on a question of humanity. A too positive denial of humanity to another race, and a too positive con tempt for a poorer class of their own race, have fostered those perverted principles, which would undermine a government filled with a more generous idea, and excite a hatred toward the people who would uphold it. As an exponent of the inhumanity of the Southern cause, it is not unjust, therefore, to point to its prisons and hospitals, where disregard 7"], [112, "93 REBEL APPEAL TO DIVINE AN'D nUMAN JUDGMENT. of the sacredness of hum ui life, and the cry of buman suffering, has such an extraordinary mani festation. And in the face of all this, the confederate con gress, with the approval of the confederate president, issued, on the 14th of June last, a manifesto, of which the following is the concluding declaration : \" We commit our cause to the enlightened judgment of the worlds to the sober reflections of our adversaries themselves, and to the solemn and righteous arbitra ment of heaven.\" Can this appeal, to both Divine and human judg ment, be really sincere, or is it only a rounded and rhetorical termination of a state paper?

Most persons eat more in winter than in summer. The cause is doubtless to be found in the fact, that, in cold weather a greater quantity of respiratory food is required in order to keep up the animal heat, than in hot weather, when the external tem perature more nearly approaches the temperature of the body.* \"He who is well fed,\" observes Sir John Eoss, \"resists coid better than the man who is stinted, while the starvation from cold follows but too soon a starvation in food.\" And Sir John Franklin, in his narrative of a jour ney to the Polar sea, writes, \"no quantity of clothing could keep us warm while we fasted.\" \"In tropical climates and. in hot seasons, the system requires a smaller quantity of food than in colder countries and in cold seasons.\"!

That this amount will be sufficient for comfort and health in the warm weather, and under the inactive life of the prisoner, we must infer from the statements of Pereira, Hammond, and Carpenter (above), and may likewise consider proven by the fact, that at Fort Dglaware, even in the cold weather of the past winters, the prisoners could not consume all that was given them, and that large quantities of food were secreted, and wasted by them* By authority of the \"War Department, the same Eegulations are observed at all stations, where prisoners of war are held,f and of course at all such stations, the same general condition of things must prevail.

The ration of meat was, in a few instances, from four (4) to six (6) ounces, but generally about two ounces, though in some cases it was less than this. The meat was irregularly given ; not often daily, and to some, only at intervals of days, or even several weeks, and when meat was served, the bread was, in many instances, diminished. About half a pint of soup, containing sweet potato, or generally beans or peas in amount about two ounces, was sometimes given, with or without meat in different cases. The beans and peas were occasionally given raw and dry. The maximum amount of solid food for one day, described, -was, ... 10 oz. bread. 6 oz. beef.

It was made of meal which was coarsely ground and rough, contained all the hull (or bran), often whole grains of corn, with fragments of cob or of husk intermingled ; frequently ill-baked, or over-baked, and sour and musty withal. The soup was, by universal declaration of the witnesses, repulsive in odor and disgusting in flavor. It appears to have been made of the water in which the beef was boiled. Gravel and sand were the least objectionable of the impur ities found in it. The beans and peas issued were generally worm-eaten, and contained these insects in quantities, so that they would be floating on the surface, or intermixed throughout the mass of soup and beans. Dunglison, in the work before quoted, says fhVSjonsf that, \"Corn bread with those unaccustomed to its use, is apt to produce diarrh\u0153a, in consequence probably of the presence of the husk,* with which it is always more or less mixed, &c. ;\" and it is \" but little adapted for those liable to bowel affections, &c.\" And Dr. Hassall says, \" In those unaccustomed to its use, maize is considered to excite, and to keep up a tendency to diarrh\u0153a.\" Every one is aware of the laxative influence of so-called bran bread, f which is due to the physical action of the hull of the grain upon the delicate lining membrane of the stom ach and bowels, acting thereupon as an excitant or irritant, though tempered by the bland influence of the wheaten flour. Now what must be the result when the meal is of corn, and coarse, and intermixed with hull and grain entire, * Prof. Dunglison informs me that by the word husk, he intends to imply that which is commonly denominated bran. t See Pereira, Pood and Diet."], [127, "113 MEDICAL REPORT. with husk and cob in fragments, among our Northern troops, who are, for the most part, \" unaccustomed to the use of corn meal?\" We see by the evidence, that some of the men observed the influence of this bread, in producing the diarrh\u0153a with which so many were afflicted. The character of the soup, as above described, would stamp it as entirely unfit for food, and upon men already suffering from diarrh\u0153a, the evil influence of such a com pound is but too plainly to be imagined. The evidence shows that some could not eat it, though hungry to star vation. The average amount of meat allowed, was so small that it is not worthy of special considera- \u00a3\u00b0ti\u2122r8,e07 la tion ; and as to the variety and change of diet, oners. upon which all physiologists lay so great stress, \u2014 it is not in the Record, \u2014 there was none of it.

The question may be answered by contrasting the exhausted, the attenuated, the melan choly, the imbecile, the dying, and the dead, Union soldiers, returning home from Richmond \u2014 with the cheerful, healthy, and vigorous, Southerners, held at, or released from, the, various United States stations referred to in the appended testimony. Let us look now at the consequence of de- ficiency of food, as explained by students and observers of the subject. 8"], [128, "114 MEDICAL REPORT. In the Medical and Surgical history of the British army which served in Turkey and the Crimea, we find that \"during January, 1855, by the deficiency of food, the effi ciency of the whole army was seriously compromised. Disease was simply the more overt manifestation of a pathological state of the system, which was all but uni versal, and merely indicated the worst grades of it. Fever and affections of the bowels represented the forms in which morbid actions were usually presented, while gangrene and scurvy indicated those privations and that exposure from which these diseases were mainly derived.\" Again, \"in starvation, the tissues of the body are consumed for the production of heat, and rapid loss of weight is the conse quence. The other vital processes all involve decompo sition of the substance of organs, and add to the loss which the body undergoes. From insufficient food for a dneeedtbyrit- few weeks, disease is almost invariably induced sufficient food. 7 typhusa.ua typhoid fever, scurvy and an\u00e6mia are the consequences.\"* Dr. Carpenter, in his Human Physi ology, says, \" the prisoners confined in Mill Bank Peniten tiary, in 1823, who had previously received an allowance Of from thirty-one to thirty -three ounces of dry nutriment daily, had this allowance suddenly reduced to twenty-one ounces, \u2014 animal food being almost entirely excluded from the diet scale. They were at the same time subjected to a low grade of temperature, and to considerable exertion ; in the course of a few weeks, the health of a large proportion of the inmates began to give way. The first symptoms were loss of color, and diminution of health and strength, subsequently diarrh\u0153a, dysentery, scurvy, and lastly ady- * Hammond's Hygiene."], [129, "115 MEDICAL REPORT. namic fevers, or headache, vertigo, convulsions, maniacal delirium, apoplexy, &c. After death, ulcerations of the mucous lining of the alimentary canal were very commonly found ; fifty-two per cent, were thus affected. That the reduction of the allowance of food was the main source of the epidemic, was proved, * * * &c.\" We appeal here to Chossat's Inquiries, resulting \u201e P i \u2022 \u2022 n. n Insufficient in the proof of this curious effect of insufficient nutrition 1. J- JJ starvation. nutriment, that it produces an incapability of digesting even the small amount consumed.\" \" So that in the end, the results are the same as those of entire depriva tion of food, the total amount of loss being almost exactly identical, but its rate being less.\" But in addition to a starvation diet, our evi- Privations dence furnishes proof of confinement to over. fO0\"than0f crowded rooms, without proper ventilation \u2014 of want of clothing \u2014 want of shelter \u2014 and denial of suitable means of warmth, whether by blankets or by fuel, and this even during the fall, winter, and spring just passed. \"Overcrowding, imperfect ventilation, and want of cleanliness, are three conditions usually associated, BCoSn'g.'Po1\" and may be designated by the single term Crowd- Poisoning.\"* The evidence exhibits that about twenty square feet was, in some instances, all the superficial space permitted to each man confined in prison. And, on Belle Isle, it would appear that for a time there was little varia tion from the same area. \"The air of crowded camps and habitations becomes contaminated through emanations given off during respiration, through effluvia from the skin, and by decomposition of the various excreta. The nitrogenized matter carried into the air from the skin, and * Woodward ; Camp Diseases."], [130, "116 MEDICAI REPORT. the products arising from the decomposition of the excreta, are sources of deadly mischief. The effects of overcrowd ing are not only manifested by the increased violence and the adynamic character of all diseases occurring among those exposed, but the development and severity of the adynamic fevers appear particularl}'- connected with this cause.\"* And again, \" To the organic matters emanating from the human body, more than to any other cause, the injurious results of overcrowding are to be ascribed.\" \"The proofs are ample, that the emanations from the human body are of a decidedly deleterious character, when present in large amounts in the atmosphere inhaled. They are absorbed by the clothing, and even the walls of the room take them up and retain them for a long time.\"f \" If animals be kept crowded together in ill-ventilated apartments, they speedily sicken.\"^: \"The continued respiration of an atmosphere charged with the exhalations of the lungs and skin, is the most potent of all the predis posing causes of disease.\"\u00a7 But Dr. Woodward alludes to \" want of cleanli- est\u2122'!!1\"9 ness\" as one of the elements of ordinary crowd- poisoning. Far more than ordinary was this \"want\" in the rebel prisons, especially on Belle Isle. A reference to the evidence will show that accumulation of filth of the most noisome character was compelled by prison discipline; that important accommodations were denied during the night hours, resulting in unavoidable soiling of the quarters of the prisoners, while the means of bathing, though convenient, were to so great an extent * Woodward. i Dunglison. t Hammond. \u00a7 Carpenter."], [131, "117 MEDICAL REPORT. denied the p.-isoners, as to produce, in a large number of them, a condition of the skin, which is not only a disease tn itself, but is also a cause of disorders various and grave* We observed the surface of the bodies of a -i ~, .

To the touch, it was as sand-paper of irregular quality. The cuticle \u2014 both effete and living \u2014 lay in masses, separated by fissures of varying extent and depth, through which watery and bloody fluids were seen exud ing. The soles of the feet were like the sole of a plasterer's sho.e \u2014 white, brown and yellow ; the cuticle dried and broken, and laminated variously. The functions of the skin, upon which physiologists lay so great stress, are here almost entirely unperformed, and hence we have \"gastric disturbances, and diarrh\u0153as,\" with suppression of that aeration of the blood \u2014 that true respira tion, which, physiologists tell us, takes place through the skin. Hence the lungs are overtaxed, and congestions are induced. And when to this we add the depraved state of the blood of the sufferers, and their exposures to cold, and wet, and storm, by day and night, we have, in full quantity, those general and special conditions, which induce pulmonary diseases of every grade and character. On the question of clothing and warmth ; from 1 Clothing and what has been shown above, a corollary is directly \u00a3*\u2122'l1j0,Ds/ deducible, viz : That if food be in limited quantity, low * See Surgeon Ely's evidence."], [132, "118 MEDICAL REPORT. temperature should be avoided, and external warmth duly maintained. \" Artificial warmth may be made to take the place of nourishment otherwise required.

Further, \" the sick and feeble will not bear the The sick and i\u00bbeibreeezS^e temperature, which to those in good condition, acts as a healthful stimulant.

Nay, is it not a cause for wonder that \"conge lation of the tissues\" was not even more common amono them ? Our evidence tells of many men freezing on Belle Isle, to loss of limb, and more, of life.

And from the same document we find that two thousand one hundred and twenty- n\u201embm diseased one, out of the two thousand seven hundred and as above- seventy -nine, were affected with debibty, adynamic fevers, diarrh\u0153a, dysentery, diseases of the chest, and scurvy \u2014 the very effects proved above to be produced by starvation, cold, over-crowding, filth, and exposure ; and, as already men tioned, the testimony of the United States surgeons at Annapolis and Baltimore, shows that the great majority of our soldiers received from rebel prisons suffered under the same affections. These surgeons further declare, that these diseases did not yield to ordinary medical treat- ment; that they were most successfully managed 0nh\u00b0S.n' by \"nullifying the cause\" that is, by nutrition and"], [134, "120 MEDICAL REPORT. stimulation, with especial attention to cleanliness and fresh air, medical agencies being only accessories, and sometimes not resorted to at all.

The evidence of those who have been under the care of the surgeons at these stations is corroborated by the testimony of Colonel Farnsworth, and by that of Surgeons Ferguson and Richards. The latter lay stress upon the offensive, and \" utterly unfit,\" character of the beds and bedding, and declare that the diet was \" entirely insuf ficient to give them a proper chance of recovery,\" and state further that there was a deficiency of medical sup plies in the hospital for Federal prisoners, while the evi dence is before us that at General Hospital No. 4, Richmond, the Confederate soldier had \" as much good food as he could eat, with good bedding and sheets ;\" and evidence to the same end appears in relation to \" Confederate hospitals in the field.\" On the subject of the mortality of Union pris- oners in rebel hands, we find that the \" Quarterly J,forl?,i'''ln. ' J Rebel Ilospi- Report \" above referred to, exhibits a record, Prisoners0 on which, though startling and fearful, is yet easily explained by the foregoing considerations. For what can be expected of men worn out, almost unto death, by the want of those things which are necessary for the body, \u2014 and then further reduced by disease, \u2014 when subjected to such privations and noxious influences as those described by Surgeons Ferguson and Richards ?

Yet the cases at Annapolis were all brought by flag-of-truce boat from City Point, Virginia, and were of the same general class as those in the \" Hospitals for the Federal Prisoners, Richmond, Virginia.\" Further, we find that \" a Confederate official, whose evidence cannot be questioned, declared that of jBeue'isie.''* the numbers remaining at Belle Isle, then about eight thousand, (8,000), about twenty-five died daily, andthat it would be but a few weeks before the deaths would count fifty a day.\" From this, we have a mortality at Belle Isle in a jatio of one hundred and fourteen pier cent. per year, with double this amount in prospect. Again ; the Macon Journal and Messenger says Ande'son \u00b0me. that \" there are now over twenty-seven thousand (27,000) prisoners at Andersonville, Georgia, among whom the deaths are from fifty to sixty a day,\" or in a ratio of about from sixty-eight to eighty-one per cent, per year* Turn now to the mortality among the rebel ro\u00b0,t'De'a\"are. prisoners at Fort Delaware, where, in addition to the more ordinary causes of sickness and death among soldier-prisoners, we find \" small-pox, the majority of the prisoners not having been vaccinated before they came here.\" Also, a \"prostrated condition of the prisoners from Vicksburg, a great many of whom had to be carried, * Since this was written a sworn statement has come to our hands (a copy of which will be found in the Supplement,) whence it appeals that the mortality at Andersonville had increased rapidly, and had advanced in fact to a ratio of from one hundred and thirty -Jive to on* hundred and fifty -two per cent, per year."], [137, "MEDICAL REPORT. 123 on their arrival here, from the boat to the hospital, and many of whom represented that they had been limited to half and quarter rations during the siege of Vicksburg ;\" and \" prisoners from Vicksburg and the Mississippi Valley laboring under miasmatic influences, under which a great number of them died.\" Yet with all these extra causes of death, the mortality for the entire year just closed, amounts to less than twenty-nine per cent., and when these special causes ceased to exist, it diminished rapidly, and during the three months of April, May, and June, it had fallen to below a ratio of ten and a half per cent, per year, and was still diminishing, while the sum total of prisoners was yet increasing. Again ; at Johnson's Island, Sandusky bay, Ohio, \u2014 the cbmate of which station has been \"Con^ \"L- land. stigmatized by our enemies as insalubrious, and in high degree pernicious to the constitution of the South erner, \u2014 the deaths among the rebel prisoners during the year 1863, with the prevalence of measles and small-pox, amo anted to less than nine per cent. ; and during May and June of this year, there were but six deaths, that is, in the ratio of less than two per cent, per year. By such contrasts of mortality at United States stations, and at rebel stations, argument and comment are struck dumb. There are still others, who are destined to fall victims to what we are compelled by the evidence mo\u00abai\u2122yal to consider a carefully devised plan for the de struction of Union soldiers, by weapons as surely, though not so mercifully, fatal, as shot and shell and bayonet.

The latter part of October received blankets, &c, from our Government ; my blankets and clothes had been taken from me. I lost flesh. Out of seven hundred that came to Belle Isle with me, I think there were about two hundred got shelter ; we were exposed to the weather. There was no name for our hunger. When a bone would be thrown away by some, it would be taken up often by others, and boiled to get something out of it. AH who were there failed in strength and flesh as I did, from starvation, I think. There were no sheds put up for us. ,. I should judge it was the corn bread which caused the diarrh\u0153a.

The corn bread gave me pain in my bowels ; often got whole grains and husks in the bread, I am positive, as I am on my oath; the proportion would be small ; after that, we got rye and corn mixed, of a better quality of bread.

I saw men that had frozen to death in the night ; I saw this seven or eight times. We had wheat bread when we first went there ; about eight inches by four and a-half, by an inch and a half or more thick ; meat ration four or five times a week, as big as my three fingers, each time, for three or four months : after that got none, except once in a while ; I had a chronic diarrh\u0153a; kept my strength pretty well till then; lost flesh before.

They took everything except the natural clothing, even to knife, on body ; no blankets given us ; I hid my money and they did not get that."], [160, "146 APPENDIX. No shelter provided ; slept on bare ground ; no covering in the least ; was put on the Isle the last day of September, or first of October; staid there eleven days; men came when I did ; had no shelter ; were turned into an enclosure in which there was no shelter ; I suppose there were two thousand without shelter. Removed to the city of Richmond ; we were all removed there ; placed in Smith's tobacco factory ; no covering nor bed until the blankets were sent to us by the United States ; received the blankets about the 1st of December. Removed to Danville, and placed in tobacco warehouse ; windows broken out ; miserable cold place ; we took the blankets with us from Richmond; so cold, we suffered; no means to keep warm, except by walking around ; the cold prevented sleeping to a great extent ; a man could not sleep alone comfortable with one h'anket. There was a great deal of stealing of blankets by the guards ; the men traded their blankets for rice ; the guards would bring rice to the window, from fifteen to twenty pounds, and offer to exchange for our blankets ; they would come to the windows and say, \" stick your blanket out so I can get hold of the end of it;\" then two or more of the guards would jerk the blanket away and not give the rice ; this was not a general thing, though it was often done ; the motive of the men for doing this, was, they were so near starved out that they were ready to take anything ; the guard would pass in bags of sand in place of rice and take blankets. When we first came there, our bread was made from middlings, shorts and bran, such as we feed our cattle ; it was a combination of most everything, corn-hulls, bran, and refuse flour ; got about half pound ; the bulk was only one-quarter larger than the loaf shown, but was lighter than this ; I should say from two to three ounces lighter. Our beef, when we first went there, would range from four to six ounces a day. Our soup was made from sweet potatoes; about half pint"], [161, "147 TREATMENT OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. in quantity, and the liquor the beef was boiled in ; some days we would not get any soup ; the soup was hardly palatable. There was a difference in our rations; we drew this black bread for about a week, then drew corn bread ; the corn bread was about the size for a ration as the loaf shown here ; I should judge our rations were heavier than that loaf, about two to three ounces, (loaf weighs now twelve ounces and a fraction). In every ration there was cobs, whole corn, as hard as on the cobs, sometimes husks as long as my finger; the loaf was sweet when we first got it; not sufficient to satisfy hunger. The way it affected me was to make me so weak I would become blind ; if I'd get up to move as far as across this room, I would become blind and everything would get dark, and I would fall from weakness ; my strength kept declining all the time before I got the diarrh\u0153a ; did not have much diarrh\u0153a until the first of March. I was removed to the hospital about the middle of December, from Danville ; I had no disease I know of but weakness, swelling of the legs,, with purple and inflamed aud yellow spots; the skin cracked and water ran out of my legs ; rations better at the hospital, when I first went there, than they were in prison ; we were allowed no privi lege at all in prison. After we tunneled out, we were only allowed to go to the privy six at a time ; the floor was in one mess \u2014 filthy ; an ordinary one-horse wagon-load of human excrement on the floor every morning. Not allowed to look out the window ; was shot at twice for looking out ; a man was shot alongside of me, while standing at the window; he was standing two feet from the window with his hand on the casement ; the sentry could not see him from the sentry's beat ; I presume the sentry saw his shadow; he stepped out of his position to shoot at him, perhaps twenty to twenty-five feet ; the sentry shot"], [162, "148 APPENDIX. him in the head and killed him instantly ; I suppose I have seen five hundred men shot at ; our orders were not to put our heads out the windows ; this man had not put his head out at that time; he had rolled up his blanket and was standing over the place where he slept on the floor ; his name was Alexander Opes, of the 101st Indiana. With one exception, we were treated very well by the physicians ; never heard any fault found of any physician but Dr. Moses, of Charlestown ; don't know his first name ; when once we had mouldy bread given to us in the hospi tal, Dr. Fontleroy made a fuss about it and had it changed WM.

About one-fifth of the men were permitted by the rebels to retain their blankets ; had no straw or board to lie on ; tents old and rotten \u2014 full of holes ; those in the tents managed to keep warm, though they couldn't sleep; those out of the tents, from three to six hundred, tried to run about to keep warm. Saw many with frozen feet carried off; in one morning saw eleven corpses, three frozen stiff. Near first of Janu ary, deaths occurred eight or ten in twenty-four hours, principally in the night; I deem the causes of those deaths to have been exposure and starvation. When I left, January 18th, there were about five thou sand men there ; I was transferred to the hospital for diar rh\u0153a and disability.

On entering Libby it was thirty-six hours before we had any rations given us, and would have suffered, if the offi cers already there had not shared with us; I mean our officers. We were packed in a room of one hundred and forty feet long by forty-five feet wide, and already occupied by nearly three hundred men.

We were wormed and dove-tailed together like fish in a basket ; in this room was the sink and privy ; we did our washing and dried our clothes in the same room ; two stoves in the room, one at each end, and two or three armfuls of wood for each per day. We were not allowed to go within three feet of the win dows to look out ; but men could not help this, and were repeatedly fired upon ; in this firing they wounded four officers ; there was hardly a day passed without firing ; any one who hung clothes near or on the windows, had the clothes confiscated and were put in the cells. Twice each day the men were crowded into two rooms for roll call; in this room were the sick and weak who could hardly stand ; the crowd was immense ; our men were counted out one by one ; the officers \u2014 there were one thousand officers ; any one not attending this roll call was compelled to stand in ranks four hours on the floor. When I first entered Libby in November, we received a small loaf of corn bread, about two ounces of poor beef and a little boiled rice each day ; the loaf was about an inch and a half longer, thicker and heavier than this* The crust was very thick; we used to call it iron-clad, and grate it and make mush out of it, as the most palat able way ; we could not grate the crusts. After November we received about two ounces of beef once in four weeks on an average ; from the 25th of March till the 6th of May not a bit of meat was issued in officers' quarters. * The same loaf before referred to."], [167, "TREATMENT OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. 153 For the three months of February, March, and April, there was a pint of black peas issued to each man every week, and a little vinegar ; these peas were full of bugs, nearly every ration ; they call them bugs, but they were little white maggots in a chrysalis state ; we pounded the peas so as to mash them, and let the bugs flow to the sur face ; there was about an ounce of soap and a little salt #^ given each man. This was inadequate to satisfy hunger, and for two months I have had a burning sensation, when in prison, in my intestines. I used to dream of food, and foolishly would blame myself for not having eaten more when at home ; the subject of food engrossed my entire thoughts ; not all suffered as I did ; the majority did ; some were fortunate enough to receive boxes from home. We were allowed to write letters once each week, not to exceed six lines. Boxes sent us from the North were stored in a warehouse near the prison ; we could see them in the windows ; the contents of the boxes were being stolen or ruined by keep ing, and when issued I think would have been eaten by none but starving men ; every package and can was broken open, and the contents were poured promiscuously into a blanket, so that everything ran in together ; they stole a great many of our boxes ; one of the guards told me that they saw our men escaping through the tunnel, and that they did not prevent them, supposing it was their own men stealing our boxes ; the Sanitary supply sent us, we re ceived but little of; we were allowed to send out and buy at extravagant prices ; they sold us the Sanitary hams, butter, and stationery. Marks of the Sanitary Commission were on the cases and on the paper. For trivial offences, officers were sent to the cells ; there had been about eighty-five men in; many of those men were innocent that were placed there as hostages; they said the cells were damp, walls green, no stoves; they were about twelve feet bv twenty ; at one time there were six-"], [168, "154 APPENDIX. teen men in those cells ; some had to stand all night ; I believe this fully. I was in the hospital with pneumonia. Just before I left, Capt. Stevens received a small box from home, sat down and ate to excess, as any man would under the circumstances, and died a few hours afterwards. The surgeon was very kind to us. The hospital food was just like the quarter food, with the exception of a little rye coffee and sugar ; not quite so much bread. I had a burning sensation on the inside, with a general failing in stiength. A man had a piece of ham which I looked at for hours. When I came away on the 16th of May, and saw the pale faces of the men through the bars, I cried. They begged me for God's sake to appeal to the Government and write to the papers\u2014 to do anything in the world to get them relieved. I am confident that if they remain long in that situation, they will never be fit for anything. The men never blame our Government for their suffering. I know the Rebels have plenty, for we went down into the cellar, and brought up corn meal, flour, potatoes and turnips, which we divided with our fellows ; the flour was excellent ; I ate about a quart of it.

Norwich, June 29th, 1864. Gentlemen : \u2014 In reply to a letter from one of your Committee, I have the honor to make the following state ment of what I saw, heard and felt of the treatment of prisoners of war by the Confederate authorities at Rich mond, Virginia: I entered service October, 1861 ; was captured on the 14th of July, 1863, in a cavalry skirmish near Halltown, Va. ; was conveyed to Richmond, and confined in Libby Prison ; was paroled and sent North on the 14th of March, 1864. My treatment by my immediate captors was gentlemanly in the extreme ; even going so far as to assist me in con cealing money, so as to prevent the Richmond authorities from robbing me. Upon reaching the Libby, we were rigidly searched, and all moneys and attractive jack-knives, nice overcoats and meerschaum pipes were kindly appropriated by the prison authorities ; rubber blankets, canteens, spurs and haversacks were taken from us. Lieut. Moran, for com plaining of this treatment, was knocked down by Richard Turner, inspector of the prison clothing. There was never an issue of clothing or blankets made by the Confederate authorities during the time I was there confined. We did receive one hundred (100) each of tin plates, cups, knives, forks, (mostly damaged by bayonet thrusts, they having been picked up from battle-fields,) for the use of one thousand (1000) officers. Accommodations \u2014 In six (6) rooms, one hundred by forty, there were confined as many as twelve hundred (1200,"], [170, "156 APPENDIX. officers of all ranks, from Brigadier-General to Second Lieutenant. This space was all that was allowed us in which to cook, eat, wash, sleep and exercise. You can see that soldierly muscle must fast deteriorate when confined to twenty (20) superficial feet of plank; we were not allowed benches, chairs or stools, nor even to fold our blankets and sit upon them ; but were forced to sit like so many slaves upon the middle passage. This continued until the appointment of General Butler, Commissioner of Exchange, aster which time we were allowed chairs and stools, which we made from the boxes and barrels sent us from the North. There was plenty of water allowed us, and a tank for bathing in four (4) of the rooms. There were seventy-six (76) windows in the six (6) rooms, from which in winter there was no protection. Subsistence. \u2014 Our rations consisted of one-quarter (f ) of a pound of beef, nine (9) ounces of bread of variable quality, generally of wheat flour, though sometimes of wheat flour and corn meal, a gill of rice, and a modicum of salt and vinegar per day. This continued until the 11th of November, which was the first day that meat was not issued, and bread made entirely of corn meal was substi tuted for wheat bread ; this meal was composed of cob and grain ground together, and when mixed with cold water, without salt or any raising, made the bread. Meat was next issued on the 14th, and the issue suspended on the 21st. On the 26th we received salt pork, sent to the pris oners by the United States Government ; from this time out, meat was like angels' visits ; sometimes it was issued at intervals of ten days, and sometimes not in thirty (30) ; the longest interval was thirty-four (34) days. The amount of rations first issued will undoubtedly sustain life ; but their long continuance without exercise will produce disease of a scorbutic nature. The rations issued aster the 11th of November will not"], [171, "treatment of union prisoners by rebels. 157 sustain life, and without the aid sent to us from the North the mortality would have been great. Nine ounces of such corn bread and a cup of water per day, are poorer rations than those issued to the vilest criminal in the meanest States Prison in the Union ; yet this was considered fit treatment by the hospitable chivalry of the South to be ex tended to men taken in honorable warfare, any one of them the peer of the arch -traitor, Jeff. Davis. Boxes. \u2014 We began to receive boxes in October. These came in good order, were inspected in our presence, and delivered to us entire ; they came regularly, and were delivered in good order up to about the 1st of January ; after this time boxes were sent regularly from the North, and were received by Col. Ould, Commissioner of Exchange, but they were not issued to us ; they were stored in a building within sight of the prison, and at the time of my leaving, three thousand (3,000) had been received there and not delivered to us; what was the cause of this non delivery of boxes we were never informed. They keep up a semblance of delivery, however, by the issue of five (5) or six (6) a week, they receiving from the North about three hundred (300) a week. The contents of these boxes were, undoubtedly, appro priated to the private use of the officials in and about Richmond. Here is simply one instance : Lieut. Maginnis, of the 18th Reg., Conn., since killed in battle, recognized a suit of citizen's clothes which had been sent to him from the North, on the person of one of the prison officials, and accused him of the theft, and showed his name on the watch-pocket of the pants. Such cases were numerous. Belle Isle. \u2014 Upon the 26th day of January, 1864, ] visited Belle Island, as an assistant in the distribution ol clothing sent by the Government and by the Sanitary Commissions of the North ; this was my first time outside of the prison walls in six months. The island is situated just opposite the Tredegar Iron Works, in the James river."], [172, "158 APPENDIX. The space occupied by prisoners is about six acres, enclosed by an earth-work three (3) feet in height ; within this space were confined as many as ten thousand (10,000) prisoners. The part occupied by the prisoners is a low, sandy, barren waste, exposed in summer to a burning sun, without the shadow of a single tree; and, in winter, to the damp and cold winds up the river, with a few miserable tents, in which, perhaps, one-half (J) the number were protected from the night fogs of a malarious region ; the others lay upon the ground in the open air. One of them said to me : \" We lay in rows, like hogs in winter, and take turns who has the outside of the row.\" In the morning, the row- of the previous night was plainly marked by the bodies of those who were sleeping on in their last sleep. Fed upon corn bread and water, scantily clothed, with but few blankets, our patriotic soldiers here suffered the severest misfortunes of this war. Here, by hundreds, they offered up their lives in their country's cause, victims of disease, starvation and exposure, \u2014 sufferings a thousand times more dreadful than the wounds of the battle-field. As many as fourteen (14) have been known to freeze to death in one night. This I have from men of my own regiment, and it is perfectly reliable. The hospitals upon the island are Sibley tents, without floors, the ground covered with straw, and logs of wood placed around for pillows, to which, when about to die, the men were carried ; and here, with logs for their pillows, the hard, cold ground for their bed, death came to their relief, and the grave closed over the victims of rebel barbarity. The officer in charge of the island was well spoken of by the men. He deprecated the condition they were in, but said he could do no more, for the authorities gave him no more to do with ; and yet it is a fact that the men were stimulated to work at their trades, as blacksmiths, &c, for the benefit of the Confederate Government, by the offer of double the quantity of rations they were then receiving;"], [173, "159 TREATMENT OF ONION PRISONERS BY REBELS. thus acting out, in their treatment of Northern soldiers, the great prin ciple of Slavery and of the South, that the lives of the poor and helpless are in their eyes of no more value than the amount of interest they will produce on capital. The facilities for washing were good, a sandy beach all around the island, and the whole number of prisoners could have washed in the course of the day ; but, under the management of the authorities, only a limited number (say 75 men per day) were able to wash, being conducted under guard to the water, in squads of five (5) or six (6). The sickness caused by the above treatment was of the respiratory organs, pneumonia, &c, and chronic diarrh\u0153a. Men were without medical treatment on the island until disease was so far advanced that when taken away in ambulances to the hospital, in squads of twe'nty (20), one half (i) of them have died within five (5) hours \u2014 some of them while their names were being taken at the hospital. Men were returned from the hospital to the island when so weak that they have been obliged to crawl upon their hands and knees a part of the way. On the 20th of November, 1863, a squad were passing the prison (Libby) in this condition, going from the hospital to the island ; among them was George Ward, a schoolmate of mine and of Col. Ely, of the 18th Conn. Vols. Col. Ely threw a ham to him from the window. As the poor fellow crawled to get it, the rebel guard charged bayonets on him, called him a damned Yankee, and appropriated the ham. The bodies of the dead were placed in the cellar of the prison, to which there was free access for animals from the street. I have known of bodies being partially devoured by dogs, and hogs, and rats, during the night. Every morning the bodies were placed in rude coffins and taken away for burial. Officers have marked the coffins thus taken away, and have seen them returned twenty (20) times for bodies. You may draw your own inference as to the rites of burial extended to a Yankee prisoner in the Capital of the Southern Confederacy."], [174, "160 APPENDIX. Officers dying, their brother officers procured metallic coffins and a vault, in which they were placed until they could be removed North. An officer, (Major Morris, of the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry, I think,) who had in .the hands of the Confederate authorities several hundred dollars, taken from him when he entered the prison, died in the hospital, and the authorities refused to use his money for a decent burial, and we raised it in the prison. Libby Mined. \u2014 Upon the approach of Kilpatrick on his grand raid on Richmond, about the 1st March, the greatest consternation was produced among the inhabitants. The authorities felt sure of his ability to enter the city and free the prisoners. We were informed one morning by the negroes who labor around the prison, that during the night they had been engaged in excavating a large hole under the centre of the building, and that a quantity of powder had been placed therein. Upon inquiring of certain of the guards, we found it the general impression among them that the prison was mined. Richard Turner, inspector of the prison, told officers there confined, that \" should Kilpatrick succeed in entering Rich mond, it would not help us, as the prison authorities would blow up the prison and all its inmates.\" The adjutant of the prison, Lieutenant Latouche, was heard by an officer (Lieutenant Jones, 55th Ohio,) to use the following words to a rebel officer with whom he had entered and examined the cellar where the powder was re ported as placed: \"There is enough there to send every damned Yankee to hell.\" Major Turner said in my presence the day we were paroled, in answer to the question, \"Was the prison mined?\" \"Yes, and I would have blown you all to Hades before I would have suffered you to be rescued.\" Bishop Johns said in the prison, when asked if he thought it was a Christian mode of warfare to blow up defenceless"], [175, "TREATMENT OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. 161 prisoners : \" He supposed the authorities were satisfied on that point, though he did not mean to justify it.\" I am very respectfully, Your obedient servant, CHAS.

David Young, Justice of the Peace. Additional Testimony by Letter of Lieutenant- Colonel Farnsworth. Norwich, Conn., July 16th, 1864. Rev. Treadwell Walden, Philadelphia: Sir : \u2014 Your favor of the 14th inst, received. In answer to your request for a written statement of facts, related to you by myself in conversation, in regard to the conduct of the guards at Richmond, Virginia, and the provision made for the sick upon Belle Isle, I submit the following : In what is known as the \" Pemberton buildings,\" nearly opposite the \" Libby,\" there were confined a large number of enlisted men. Hardly a day went by that the guards did not fire upon the prisoners. I have known as many as"], [176, "162 APPENDIX. fourteen shots to be fired in one day. They were thus sub ject to death if they merely came near the window to obtain fresh air. It was a very common occurrence to hear the report of a musket and then see the sergeant of the guard bring out a wounded or dead soldier. The guards would watch for an opportunity to fire upon their prisoners, and, without warning the prisoner to leave the vicinity of the window, fire. Lieutenant Hammond, of the Ringgold cavalry, (better known to Libbians as \" Old Imboden,\") was at the sink, which is constructed upon the outside of the building. From the upper part of the sides, boards are removed for the purpose of light or ventilation. The guard below caught sight of Lieutenant Hammond's hat, through this opening, and fired. The ball entered the side, far below the opening, showing that the guard was intent upon striking his man ; but a nail gave the bullet an upward turn and it passed through Ham mond's ear and hat-brim. From the position he was in, there is little doubt that but for the ball striking the nail he would have been struck in the breast. The attention of Major Turner was called to it, but he only laughed and said, \" The boys were in want of practice.\" The guard, when spoken to about it, said, \" He had made a bet he would kill a damned Yankee before he came off guard.\" There was not the least attention paid by the com mander of Libby prison to this deliberate attempt at murder. Lieutenant Thos. Huggins, of a New York regiment, was standing at least eight feet from a window on the second floor ; the guard could just see the top of his hat To be sure of his man, the guard left his beat and stepped into the street. Being seen, a warning cry was uttered, and Hugo-ins stooped and the bullet buried itself in the beams above. This was the same guard that fired at Hammond. Richard, or as usually called, Dick Turner was the in spector of the prison, and acted under the orders of the commander. There was nothing too mean for him to do. He searched you when you entered, knocked you down if"], [177, "TREATMENT OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. 163 you grumbled, took your blanket from you if found lying upon it after morning roll-call, never spoke of you except as damned Yankees \u2014 told you \"you were better treated than you deserved.\" This \"high-toned Southron\" was employed as the negro whipper of the prison. Colonel Powell, 2d Virginia cavalry, (Union,) Colonel Streight and Captain Reed, 51st Indiana, and others who had been confined in the cells, used to witness the whippings, (the cells were at one end of the cellar where the whipping block was,) and they could hear, \u2014 even if they shut their eyes to the horrid exhibition. Colonels Powell and Streight told me of as many as six negro women having been stripped and whipped, at one time, for having passed bread to our soldiers as they marched through the street. The flogging of the negroes that worked at the Libby was an every-day occurrence. These blacks were free negroes from the North, who were employed as servants, but fell into the hands of the enemy. He flogged one of them so severely that he was unable to move for two weeks, and walked lame months after. His offence was resisting a white negro-driver. The hospital tents on Belle Isle were old Sibleys. These were not temporary hospitals, for many died in them each day ; but when they could not contain all the sick some sick were removed to Richmond hospitals. These tents were awful places for human beings to be placed in \u2014 with out floors, a heap of straw for a bed, logs of wood for pil lows \u2014 men died with less attention than many a man pays to a favorite dog. The hospitals in Richmond were much better, being in buildings, and were furnished with bunks and straw beds \u2014 some of them with sheets. But though treated with kindness, compared with Belle Island, the want of proper medicines was visible, and many died for the want of the most simple remedies. Upon the 25th of October, 1863, two officers, (Major"], [178, "164 APPENDIX. Hewsten, 132d New York, and a Lieutenant 4th New York Cavalry,) escaped from the hospital. Immediately, upon its being known, all the sick who were well enough to sit up or stand, were removed from the room and placed in an empty room under our prison. Here they were kept for twenty-four hours, without food or blankets, as a punishment, it was said, for not reporting the contem plated escape of the officers named. From this treatment, Surgeon Pierce of the 5th Maryland died. The officers in the room above, removed a portion of the floor and furnished the sick with food and drink, and shared their blankets with them. This coming to the knowledge of Major Turner, we were deprived of rations for one day \u2014 October 29th, 1863. This was not the action of the surgeons of the Libby, for, with one exception, they were kind and attentive, and did all in their power for our comfort, but of the com mander of the department, Brigadier-General Winder, and of Major Turner, commander of the prison, who, I am in formed, was dismissed from West Point, by orders from the Secretary of War, having been convicted of forgery. I was informed by men whom I knew \u2014 Ward and Win ship of the 18th Connecticut, and Ferris and Stone of the 1st Connecticut \u2014 that the enclosure in Belle Isle was a mass of filth every morning, from the inability of the men to proceed to the sinks after evening. Many of the guards would fire upon the prisoners for the least violation of the rules. The men were in a miser able condition and looked sickly, worn out \u2014 starvation and exposure was expressed upon their features. Trusting that the above will assist you in your report.

Y. ; captured 12th May, 1863 ; taken to Libby Prison same day; remained there twelve days; found Union officers there ; my treatment same as officers re ceived ; daily rations, when first entered, were four inches by four inches by two of unbolted bread, which was coarse and sour about half the time ; a ration of beans, worm eaten, once a day ; about seven quarts to fifty-three or fifty-four men, or a gill to each man was served ; no other food was furnished by the Confederates ; what other they had was bought with their own money. (The ration of light bread of a common soldier in the United States Army is twenty-two ounces, and twelve ounces of pork or twenty of beef; besides that, our sol diers have thirty pound of potatoes for one hundred ra tions, or nearly a third of a pound per day to each man, besides coffee and sugar, &c, &c.) The food furnished us was insufficient for healthful sup port of life. When I reached the Libby Prison there were say twenty-five Union officers, no more, in the prison, recently captured; all the former occupants had been removed, as I am informed (and belove) by the rebels, to the number"], [180, "166 APPENDIX. of seven hundred or over ; when I left the prison on the 28th, there were sixty-nine Union officers there. I spent four days in Hospital No. 21, where wounded Union prisoners (very few sick) were under treatment; I was there partly as a visitor, and also did partial duty as a surgeon in the ward ; I was too ill to do full duty ; I had better rations in the hospital than in prison, for I had rye coffee and a little meat, say two ounces daily, very poor bacon ; the wounded men had the same ration of bread, no beans, two ounces of meat, rye coffee, occasionally a little sugar, and one gallon milk, and one gallon whisky, divided among two hundred and sixty men, or about a tablespoon ful of whisky and milkier man ; they had no other nutri ment or stimulation. I consider the nourishment and stimulation they received entirely insufficient to give them a proper chance for re covery. I am surprised that more do not die. There were many bad cases among them that must inevitably sink under this treatment after a few days, and therefore I can not state the true proportion of deaths. The condition of these men was such that any medical observer would im pute it to insufficient stimulation and nutrition. The condi tion of the wounds generally was very unhealthy, not tending to heal, pale and flabby, and the tissues lax \u2014 just such a condition as we expect to see where the patient is improperly nourished by deficient nutrition. These wounded have all been brought there since the battle of Spottsyl vania Court House. When I was captured, I was brought into a rebel fort. It was raining. I had on a rubber blanket ; the blanket was taken from my shoulders by a lieutenant, by the authority and consent of the commanding officer. I remonstrated against his taking my private property, and appealed to the commanding officer for protection, and to protect my rights. He replied, \" Damn you, you have no rights.\" It was not possible for him to have been ignorant of the fact that I was a medical officer. Some two or three hours after-"], [181, "167 TREATMENT OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. wards, when I was about to leave the fort for Libby Prison, the lieutenant remarked to me, \"I hope I have treated you kindly.\" I replied, \" I have always treated your men and officers with kindness and consideration, but you have treated me harshly.\" I don't think he made any reply. The Provost-Marshal took away my sabre. I told him it was my private property, and that he ought not to take it away, and his answer was, \" It don't make any difference, I have a friend to whom I intend to give it.\" I have had wounded rebels under my hand for treatment on various occasions. The course I have always adopted is, to take care of my own men first, then the rebels, giving them equal care and attention of every kind. I have taken my own private rations and given them repeatedly to wounded rebels. All other medical officers of our army have done likewise, as far as my observation has extended. I have been in the service two years and eight months, and I have been in all the cavalry fights of the Army of the Potomac since I entered the service. The buildings in Richmond occupied for hospital pur poses are well suited for such purposes, being large, con venient, and well ventilated. The wards are well supplied with water, and tolerably cleanly. The prison (Libby) had just been thoroughly cleaned and was well white-washed. In the prison, we had one blanket as bed, and one as cover. No one can appreciate, without experience, the condi tion of the officers in the prison during the twelve days of my stay. Their faces were pinched with hunger. I have seen an officer, standing by the window, gnawing a bone like a dog. I asked him \"what do you do it for ?\" H:s reply was, \" it will help fill up.\" They were constantly complain ino- of hunger. There was a sad and insatiable expression of the face impossible to describe. The bedding in Hospital No. 21, where the privates were confined by wounds, was very dirty. The covering was entirely old dirty quilts. The beds were offensive from the discharges from wounds and secretions of the body."], [182, "168 APPENDIX. and were utterly unfit to place a sick or wounded man on. On the faces of the wounded there was an anxious, hag gard expression of countenance, such as I have never seen before. I attribute it to want of care, want of nourishment and encouragement. There is a deficiency of medical sup plies, such as bandages, lint, sticking-plaster, and medicines generally in this hospital, whether from actual want of these articles, or from unwillingness to supply them, I do not know.

I have been the recipient of all the prisoners returned from Richmond since the 1st of June, 1863, except one steamboat load which were four hundred to five hundred. I have received, I should judge, nearly (3000) three thou sand; these are in a debilitated condition, badly clad, and down-spirited, on account of ill-treatment by starvation and exposure, as they all on inquiry agree in stating, and as I am convinced is the case by their actual condition on their arrival, and by rations shown to me, which they unanimously state are the only ones given them."], [184, "170 APPENDIX. They unanimously state that their blankets, overcoats, watches, and jewelry and money have been taken from them, partially by their immediate captors, but also in a quasi-official way, telling them that they wdl be restored when they are released, which, as far as I know, and have been informed, has never been done. The returned prisoners state that the officials, such as guards and nurses, often receive money from them, such as they may have been able to secrete, with the promise that they shall have the equivalent returned in food, which pro mise is not performed. Colonel Palmer de Cesinola (4th New York Cavalry) told me that while acting as distributing commissary of articles of food and clothing sent by United States Government and United States Sanitary Commission, he observed that some of our prisoners at Richmond and Belle Isle, in order to receive a less cruel treatment and to obtain larger rations, were acting as shoemakers for the Rebel Government. He at once told those men that such action was disloyal, as by so doing they indirectly assisted the rebellion. The result of this his remark induced the rebel authorities to deprive him of the privilege of being longer a distributing commissary. Almost in all cases I find that our men state that when they were captured, they were in very good condition as to general physical health; but I do not even need such a statement, as I am well acquainted with the regulations which govern the medical department of our army, \"to send to the rear every man who is not perfectly able to bear arms,\" and if a few feeble men have fallen into the hands of the rebels, they belong to the class called \"stragglers,\" which certainly belong to the minority. From my experience of fifteen years of constant medical and military service in Northern Europe, the East Indies, and Mediterranean, as well as in our own army since Sep tember, 1861, I affirm that the treatment to which our men have been subjected while prisoners of war in the hands of the enemy, is against all rules of civibzed warfare, and that"], [185, "TREATMENT OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. 171 I would prefer to fall into the hands of the Chinese of Borneo, called \"Anack Baba,\" who murder their prisoners, than to fall into the hands of the rebels, where the lives and com fort of prisoners of war is a matter of such cruel indiffer ence, to say the least, if not indeed, as one might almost be justified in supposing, a matter of determined policy. If I may believe the statements of our returned prisoners, the diseases under which they are suffering when they come into my hands, are attributable to the following causes, one or more: deprivation of clothing, deficiency of food in quantity and quality, want of fresh air, on account of over crowding in prison buildings and consequent unavoidable uncleanbness, and mental depression, the result of the above causes, and want of adequate shelter, exposure dur ing the fall and winter. The diseases most common among these returned prisoners are scurvy, diarrh\u0153a, and congestion of the lungs, which are not amenable to the ordinary treatment in use in civil life or in hospitals of our own army. They are most successfully mastered by high nutrition and stimulation, with cleanliness and fresh air \u2014 medicinal treatment being of small assistance in the recovery of the sufferers, and often being entirely dispensed with. The medical records in my office show that this system is the only valid and effective mode of management, thus proving by the counteracting effect of good food, air, clean liness, and stimulants, that these disorders are the result of the causes above stated.

General Hos- pital Division, No. i, Annapolis, Maryland, June 6th, 1864. Dr Ellerslie Wallace: Philadelphia, Penn. Doctor: \u2014 I am in receipt of your communication of the 2d inst., and would reply as follows : \u2014 I am an Assistant Surgeon of Volunteers in the service of the United States, and have been on duty in this hospital since October 3d, 1863, as executive officer and medical officer in charge of a ward. I have been present on the arrival of nearly every boat load of paroled prisoners since my connection with this hospital commenced. I remember distinctly the arrival of the flag-of-truce steamer \"New York,\" November 18th, 1863, and was present and assisted in unloading the men. I went on board the boat and saw bodies of six (6) men who had died during the passage of the steamer from City Point, Va., to this place. No words can describe their appearance. In each case the sunken eye, the gaping mouth, the filthy skin, the clothes and head alive with vermin, the repelling, bony contour \u2014 all cod spired to lead to the conclusion that we were looking upon the victims of starvation, cruelty and exposure, to a degree unparalleled in the history of hu manity. I have never seen more than the above number of dead in any single arrival; but at other dates, and on several occa sions, I have seen two (2) and three (3) dead on board the boat, and have repeatedly known four (4) or six (6) to die within twelve (12) hours of their reception into hospital."], [187, "TREATMENT OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. 173 The same condition evidenced in the cases of the six (6) re ferred to above, has characterized nearly every instar.ee, and leads us irresistibly to the conclusion that death has been owing to a long series of exposure and hardships, with a deprivation of the barest necessities for existence. I have known paroled prisoners of war to be admitted to this hospital with barely sufficient clothing to cover their nakedness. I cannot say that I have seen any single case where a patient was admitted without either hat, coat, shoes, shirt, or stockings, but I have repeatedly seen men without one (1), two (2), or three (3) of these articles, and think that I can say, that when they possessed all, it was an excep tional case. It is our rule to strip each patient to his skin, and provide all with entirely new clothing, because rags, filth and vermin preponderate so largely as to render any further use of the various articles of apparel upon the bodies of patients reaching this point from Richmond, Va., unhealthy, and in opposition to the simplest principles of hygiene. Patients, when asked the manner in which they lost their clothing, reply that they were robbed of what they had when captured, or else, that during their imprisonment, oftentimes extending over many months, their clothing, piece by piece, wore out, and that they had no opportunity to procure a change. It is impossible for any, save those who have seen the condition of paroled men soon after their release from cap- tivity, to have any idea of the state of the skin covering their bodies. In many cases that I have observed, the dirt incrus- tation has been so thick as to require months of constant ablution to recover the normal condition and function of the integument. Patients have repeatedly stated, in answer to my interrogations, \" that they had been unable to wash their 'bodies once in six (6) months ,\u25a0\" that all that time they had lain in the dirt, and, as might naturally be expected, the filth accumulation was constantly increasing. Frequently, the entire cuticle must die and be detached before any healthy action can be recovered."], [188, "174 APPENDIX. I know not how to better compare the cutaneous condi tion of these men in its different morbid states, than to liken it, in feeling, to the effect produced upon the fingers by pass ing them over sand-paper from the coarsest quality down to that moderately fine. Diaphoretic action in many such cases, I have found almost unattainable. When we consider the importance of the cutaneous secretion, relative to a state of health, it can not be denied that, in many instances under attention, this is the prime exciting cause of the diseases of the pulmonary and abdominal organs, which are so constantly found among our Richmond patients. A great many post-mortem examinations of paroled pri soners who have died in our hospitals, have been made by myself and others. The thoracic organs are seldom found healthy. The pectoral muscles are so much wasted as to ren der the walls of the chest, to a certain extent, transparent. The lungs frequently are found filling but half the pulmo nary cavities. Old pleuritic adhesions, in all degrees of ex tent, are generally seen ; almost invariably there is a local stasis or congestion of blood, posteriorly and about the roots of the lungs ; the heart is found flaccid, and often its walls are attenuated ; when taken out and laid down, it flat tens from its own weight, is seldom filled with a substantial clot, and generally contains but a very little dark, thin blood. Tubercular deposit is sometimes very extensive, and in cases where there is no external appearance favoring the scrofu lous diathesis, leading me to the conclusion that it has been engendered ofttimes, in a previously healthy subject, by the deprivation of good, wholesome food, and the combination of unhealthy influences, to which so many of our prisoners of war succumb. The liver is unusually pale in color, and of an\u00e6mic aspect ; the intestines are sometimes much dis eased, but frequently healthy. I have known many in stances of marked chronic diarrh\u0153a, resulting fatally, yet disclosing no organic intestinal changes or morbid appear ances,\u2014favoring the supposition that the diarrh\u0153a is often"], [189, "175 TREATMEN1 OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. only a symptom of a want of tonicity, not of organic dis ease. I consider the frequency of pulmonary congestions among our patients from Richmond, owing to the altered condition of the fluids of the system, especially the blood ; its fibri nous portion becomes diminished, and stagnation takes place in the most depending portions of the lungs, giving us what we term a hypostatic pneumonia, depending on the want of tone in the vessels and consequent enfeebled. circulation. The treatment which I have found most effective in aid ing the restoration to health of our reduced Richmond patients is, very briefly, as follows : Quinine, iron, and cod liver oil, (in their different preparations and combinations,) in small doses; bquid concentrated nourishment, a rigid enforcement of cleanliness, and regularity in eating and drinking, and, if possible, the hygienic advantages of a tent ward. Our records exhibit a mortahty among our patients from Richmond of 18 per cent. I am, Doctor, very respectfully, Your obedient servant. WILLIAM S ELY, Assistant Surgeon U. S. Volunteers.

I have seen an hundred of the rations served to the men. I do not consider the rations I have seen sufficient for the support of life for any long time. We give our men twenty ounces of beef on a march, per day, and twenty-two ounces of bread ; fourteen ounces of meat and ten ounces of bread will keep any man from starving ; less than twelve ounces of bread and ten ounces of meat per diem would produce disease, and if long con tinued, would fail to keep life up to the standard in a great majority of men. Lower than this would end in debility and"], [191, "TREATMENT OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. 177 decline ; in proportion as you vary a man's diet, so is his general health* The majority of the men did walk from the landing here. We did not receive the worst cases. In the main, the diseases were produced by insufficient and a bad quality of diet. Their stomachs were not able to retain a sufficient quantity of solid food when the men first got here. I was led to the belief that the diarrh\u0153a was produced by bad diet. I found nutrition was the most successful treatment. Have had cases of frost bite here resulting in mortifica tion of the ends of the toes. Those were cases from Rich mond, eight or ten cases. Though the men would be strong enough to walk from the dock up here, at the same time they were in that debil itated condition that a sbght change of air would cause congestion of the lungs, and death. Stimulants and tonics are largely used. There were a good many cases of scurvy. In the ma jority of cases of diarrh\u0153a, there would be scorbutic symp toms. I had at one time eight returned prisoners who lost their teeth. I suppose this was owing to the treatment these men had received, and their diet. At the hospital we give each man twenty ounces of bread per day, and one pound of meat, including bone ; could not give the per centage of bone ; we also give vegetables. In the winter we give cabbage, potatoes rice and beans, mo lasses, tea, butter. A healthy soldier would get no butter.

On or about the 16th of April, 1861, I received at the hospital over which I have charge, some two hundred and fifty paroled prisoners of war, recently returned from1 Bede Island and Richmond. The greater majority of these men were in a semi-state of nudity. They were laboring under such diseases as chronic diarrh\u0153a, phthisis pulmonalis, scurvy, frost bites, general debility, caused by starvation, neglect, and exposure. Many of them had partially lost their reason, forgetting even the date of their capture and every thing connected with their antecedent history. They resemble, in many respects, patients laboring under cretinism. They were filthy in the extreme, covered with vermin. Some had extensive bed sores caused by laying in the sand and dirt, and nearly all were extremely emaciated ; so much so that they had to be cared for even like infants. Their hair had not been cut, nor the men shaved in many instances for months. On inquiry of these men as to what was the matter with them, the invariable answer was, starvation, exposure, and neglect, while prisoners on Belle Island. They informed me, that while on Belle Island during the inclement months"], [194, "180 APPENDIX. of the past winter, there were congregated at one time, in a space less than three acres, one hundred and ten squads of prisoners, each numbering one hundred persons. Less than half of these had old worn out Sibley and other tents for shelter. The remainder were obliged to accommodate them selves as best they could. But a few of them had blankets. These were issued to them by our Government under flag of truce. Some had overcoats. Many had no shoes except patches that they had contrived themselves. Those that escaped freezing to death during the cold nights, did so by exercising and by huddbng together in heaps like hogs, alternating places with those more exposed in the heaps, and with those in the tents, until at last they were obliged to go to the hospital. They informed me, that each morning, numbers were foimd frozen to death, who had jjrobably died from other causes \u2014 exhaustion. They stated to me further, that they believed this system of slow starvation was carried on to prevent other men from enlisting in our army. The ration allowed them was a small piece of corn bread, the meal of which contained also the cob, a little rice soup very rarely, and sometimes, but rarely, a small quantity of meat \u2014 a few ounces ; they confessed that they had eaten clog meat whenever they were so fortunate as to capture a dog. In the hospitals, according to the statement made to me by Hospital Steward James, United States Army, they fared a bttle better, although, even there, they had an insufficiency of food, and the beds were filthy and covered with vermin. He states that at hospital No. 21, where he was serving as one of the apothecaries during three months, January, Feb ruary and March, there were admitted two thousand seven hundred of our men, of whom nearly fourteen hundred and fifty died.* They lacked medicines and all appliances * The quarterly report from which these figures are taken, was obtained and brought home by a returned Union prisoner.

The patients in the hospital had one advantage over prisoners of war on Belle Island, that was, they were allowed to buy a loaf of bread the size of a man's fist, for which they paid five or six dollars Confederate money. Out of the two hundred and fifty men received by me, so far, fifteen have died ; the post-mortems of which have made apparent diseases of nearly all the viscera to a remarkable extent. I received one man incurably insane, caused, as I was informed and believe, by joy, produced by the news that he was to be exchanged. I found, from excess of habit, they had become like savages in their habits, and lost the decencies of life, and had to be taught like children the decencies of society. The health and constitutions of the majority of these men are permanently undermined. Under proper care and treat ment, which consisted in their not eating too much, a spare but concentrated diet, many have rallied. In one instance a boy gained forty pounds in two weeks ; he still has phthisis and can hardly stand exposure or active exercise. A case of scurvy occurred among others which is the worst I ever saw or read of; a man turning red or nearly black from head to foot ; he died in twenty-four hours. I think nine-tenths of the men weighed under one hun dred pounds; they appeared to be articulated skeletons; covered with simply integument ; had dropsy and \u0153dema in the feet, caused by weakness ; and were the most pitiable objects to behold.

On the 18th of April, 1861, I received at the hospital one hundred and five of the paroled prisoners from Richmond, brought to this point on the flag-of-truce boat \" New York.\" These were the worst cases received at this point by that boat ; none of them being able to stand alone. All were brought into the hospital upon stretchers. Nearly all were in an extreme state of emaciation, filthy in the extreme, and covered with vermin. Some of them so eaten by the vermin as to very nearly resemble a case of scabbing from small-pox, being covered with sores from head to foot, so as scarcely to be able to touch a well portion of the skin with the point of the finger. Their appearance was such in the way of filth and dirt, as to convince any one that they had not had an opportu nity for ablution for weeks and months. Several were in a state of semi-insanity, and all seemed, and acted, and talked, like children, in their desires for food, &c. Very few of them had blankets or clothing some in a state of semi nudity. Upon being questioned upon the causes of their condi tion, the testimony was universal: \u2014 starvation, exposure, and neglect, whde prisoners at Richmond and Belle Isle."], [197, "183 TREATMENT OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. Their universal declaration was, in reference to their living, that they were provided with only one smaU portion of corn-bread per day, which was made simply from corn meal and water, without salt, not larger than a man's hand ; it was about an inch and a quarter thick. This was the por tion for the day. They sometimes got small portions of meat once a day, two days in a week. Several of them told me that they had been able to get occasionally a small piece of the flesh of a dog, which they had cooked and eaten with great relish, and that they had caught rats and eaten them in the same way. Many of them believed that the meat issued to them was cut from the bodies of mules. They said, while on Belle Isle they had no means of shelter, but were obliged to huddle together in heaps, to protect themselves from the inclement weather ; \u2014 often one or two blankets in thickness covering five or six persons ; \u2014 often lying one upon another in tiers, and changing places as they became tired out. They state that they had bttle or no shelter while prisoners at Belle Isle. We were obliged to treat them as chddren, in regulating their diet in the hospital, having to restrain their over eating, and confine them to a concentrated but nourishing and generous diet. Several cases had no disease whatever, but suffered from extreme emaciation and starvation. The limb of one of these men could be spanned with the thumb and finger, just above the knee. This patient, a boy of nineteen years old, would not weigh over fifty pounds then, though in health probably one hundred and thirty-five pounds. This was not a solitary instance, many others being extremely ema ciated. Many presenting the appearance of mere hving skeletons, with the skin drawn tightly over the bones. Many of them were laboring under such diseases as dropsy, pulmonary consumption, scurvy, mortification from cold, several having lost one-half of both feet from this cause. Several were afflicted with very severe bed-sores, caused"], [198, "184 APPENDIX. by lying in the sand without shelter. One man, unable to he in any other way but on his face, and hved about four weeks in this way. Up to the present time, of the number received, (one hun dred and five,) forty-two have died. All gave evidence of extensive visceral disease, of which starvation, cold, and neglect, were undoubtedly the primary cause. Some of the cases sank from extreme debility, without any evidence of disease as the cause of death. A. CHAPEL, Surgeon U. S. A. Affirmed to and subscribed before me, June zd, 1864. D. P.

Dix, sworn and examined: \u2014 Last winter I was at Annapolis and examined many hun dred returned prisoners. I inquired of these men exactly the manner in which they were fed and treated on Belle Island, examined them individually, and by sixes and sevens. I saw no disposition on the part of these men to exaggerate their sufferings. Inquiring from what causes they had suffered most severely, whether rapid marches, exposure to inclement weather, lack of apparel, or hunger, \u2014 the answer was inva riably, \"From hunger while at Belle Island.\" I inquired the amount of animal food allowed a day, when they had any at all; they replied that an iron-bound bucket, filled"], [199, "TREATMENT of union prisoners by REBELS. 185 with packed meat, was the allowance for one hundred men ; the weight of bucket and meat would be twenty-five pounds. When cooked this afforded a very small quantity for each man. As Winter and Spring advanced, the only food sup plied was corn meal mixed with water and roughly baked. This bucket of meat I speak of was allowed them about twice a week, with a very little rice in the autumn. I understand that in the hospitals they occasionally had a little boded rice, to which was sometimes added a very small quantity of brown sugar or molasses. I gather from Confederate authority as well as from our returned prisoners, \u2014 and a Confederate official whose evi dence cannot be questioned in that matter, declared, that the sole sustenance at Belle Island was corn meal and water, \u2014 that of the numbers remaining at Belle Island, then about eight thousand, about twenty-five died daily ; that the mor tality in Georgia was still greater, and that it would be but a few weeks before the deaths would count fifty a day. Another fact which he affirmed as a reason for withhold ing so much from our prisoners, sent by their friends and the Government, was the cruel and severe restrictions imposed on their men in our hands. I had visited those very prisoners to whom he referred at Point Lookout; they were supplied with vegetables, with the best wheat bread, and fresh or salt meat three times daily, in abundant measure \u2014 the full Government ration. In the camp of about nine thousand rebel prisoners, there were but four hundred reported to the surgeon ; of these one hundred were confined to their beds, thirty were very sick, and perhaps fifteen or twenty would never recover. The hospital food consisted of beef tea, beef soup, rice, milk, milk punch, milk gruel, lemonade, stewed fruits, beef steak, vegetables and mutton; white sugar was employed in cooking. The supplies were, in fact, more ample and abundant than in hospitals where our own men were under treatment."], [200, "186 APPENDIX. To return to the condition of the Federal prisoners on Belle Island, there was at no time adequate shelter for the entire number till late in spring, when the number had been greatly reduced by transfer to Georgia, exchanges, and death. I was told that in the morning it was not uncommon to find men dead from exposure and rain. I have repeatedly seen the exchanged prisoners reduced to the lowest extremity through want of food. Of more than four hundred landed in Baltimore, some little time since, nearly, if not the entire number, were suffering from the effects of hunger ; more than one hundred of these were taken a few yards across the wharf, to the hospital, on stretchers; seven died before they could be taken into the building, and seven more that same night. Their clothing was filthy to the last degree ; they were covered with ver min ; they were the merest bundles of bones and skin, and some bones piercing the flesh. The cries of these poor men for food, were pitiful in the extreme. In addition to their other sufferings, many had lost por tions of their feet by frost. The minds showed the weakness of the body. Some were reduced to idiocy. They would entreat for an apple or a bit of meat to look at, if they could not be allowed solid food. Many of these poor creatures died, and others, I understand from surgeons, are enfeebled for life. Many of these prisoners when brought on the flag-of-truce boat, were observed to clasp their hands and fix their gaze upon the American flag : \" It is enough, thank God, we are at home.\" A remarkable trial of disinterestedness : Rev. M. Hall said, \" What can I do for you, my boys?\" \" Hasten exchanges and bring away our comrades.\" A gentleman of Washington, who had been permitted to convey a body for burial to the South, on board the flag-of truce boat, remarked that all the rebel prisoners were in vigorous health, equipped in clothes furnished by the United States Government; many of them with blankets"], [201, "TREATMENT OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. 187 and haversacks, while we received in return not one able bodied man at that time. I have witnessed this fact myself, on other occasions on the flag-of-truce boats. The rations served to the prisoners on Belle Island, whether drawn from supplies furnished by the Federal Government, or through the individual liberality of North ern citizens, were never dispensed in sufficient quantities by the Confederate authorities to satisfy hunger. I have seen tons of provisions shipped on the flag-of-truce boat from the North, for the relief of our prisoners at Rich mond. Little or nothing came from the South for rebel prisoners at the North. Clothing and blankets were sent by our Government to the prisoners in quantities, but not fully distributed. One reason why our men were so wholly destitute of clothing at a late season, was the temptation they were under to give them away for a biscuit, or a small quantity of food, to save them from starvation.

This is a general statement of all my observation. My experience extended over three boat loads. No differ ence in the condition of the prisoners' clothing. The condi tion of the men on the last boat as to physical state, was worse than all previous. Two or three boat loads have arrived since my services ceased. Mr. Thompson, one of the United States Sanitary Commission Agents, accompanied the men on these boats. Mr. Thompson is now at White House, Virginia, on the Pamunky river. Cannot communi cate with him by telegraph. In general aspect and condition of returned prisoners, all were more or less emaciated. Of the first boat load, three fifths very much so. Of second and third boats, four-fifths very much so. The condition of some of those who were less emaciated than others, was owing to their having money with which they purchased provisions. I believe the fact from statements made by them on my inquiry. My atten tion was drawn to the fact by the Assistant Surgeon. I could pick out the men that had money by their physical con dition. Clothing was usually taken from them by their captors before their arrival at Richmond. Money was taken from them officially just before entering prison, except those that had succeeded in secreting it. I believe these facts from statements made by the men. They were also credited with the amounts, and were told that when released the amounts would be returned. I heard of no soldier who had it re turned to him. In case of officers it was sometimes returned in Confederate currency. On the first boat load there was about one hundred and fifty on cots sick, \u2014 with diarrh\u0153a generally. Many of these one hundred and fifty men had the scurvy; great many suffering from pneumonia. Often heard the physician say that these disorders were due to confinement, exposure, and bad food. In all I saw some ten or twelve dying on the"], [204, "190 APPENDIX. boats. From the last boat I saw five come off on shore in a dying state. I saw one man die on the boat ; the Doctor said his death was caused by starvation. Saw one already dead on the boat at Fortress Monroe. The Doctor said his death was caused by eating. He died from eating too much after he had been starved. He obtained this over amount of food after having come into our hands. The Doctor said that he had to be very cautious in giving them their rations, or they would injure themselves by getting too much ; that several had died in consequence of eating too much, which they obtained from their comrades, who were too feeble and too far gone to eat the rations which were given them. Some would secrete their rations and try to get a second ration. The Assistant Surgeon told me that the one I had seen dead, had eaten three rations which he had obtained from his comrades. The prisoners on board the boats stated that their diseases and sufferings, such as I witnessed, were caused by want of protection from wet and cold, and by insufficient and bad food; this was their invariable statement The Union prisoners were not at all vindictive, and ex pressed a desire to have the rebel prisoners well clothed and fed ; this was the case with all the men I spoke to on the subject on the three boats. My reason for making this inquiry was the remark of the Union prisoners in regard to the healthy condition of the rebel prisoners who were exchanged. Some of them re marked that it would make the condition of the Union prisoners worse if they attempted to retaliate, and would do no good. The general idea as expressed by the men was, that they did not wish to see the rebel prisoners treated as they had been. I have been on the battle-field and in hospitals and wit nessed much suffering, but never did I experience so sad and deplorable a condition of human beings, as that of the paroled Union prisoners just from Belle Island, and the rebel prisons of the South, emaciated by starvation, with"], [205, "191 TREATMENT OF UNION PRISONERS BY REBELS. impaired minds, vision, powers of speech and hearing, oc casioned by want of sufficiency of wholesome food, exposure to the cold and inclement storms of wind and rain. I believe from what I have seen and experienced among our unfortu nate prisoners on board the flag-of-truce boats, that their barbarous treatment and sufferings which they endured while confined in the military prisons of the South, can hardly be exaggerated.

Sir, \u2014 I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th nit., in which, in behalf of a Com mittee of the United States Sanitary Commission, you make iriquiry in relation to the condition and treatment of rebel prisoners of war in our hands. In reply, you are respectfully informed that such pri soners are treated with all the consideration and kindness that might be expected of a humane and Christian people. The rations allowed to them are ample and of good quality. The reduction recently made in the prisoner's ration, was for the purpose of bringing it nearer to what the rebel authorities profess to allow their soldiers, and no complaint has been heard of its insufficiency. Suitable provision has been made by the Government for supplying the prisoners with all necessary clothing and blankets; and at each depot there is a sutler, authorized to sell to them, at reasonable rates, certain prescribed articles of comfort and convenience, such as our soldiers desire to purchase. Fuel is provided by the army regulations, and is liber ally furnished."], [212, "198 APPENDIX. Shelter is not denied to any \"during the inclement and cold season,\" and for those who require them, comfortable hospital accommodations, and skillful medical and surgical attention are provided. The Commissary-General of Prisoners informs me that he has heard of no orders to shoot prisoners for being at the windows or near them, and he does not believe that orders of that character have any where been given. He has heard of no prisoners being shot under such cir cumstances. General Butler did, in the early part of this year, offer to exchange prisoners, grade for grade, and ma/i for man, of those at Point Lookout, and two other places, but the pro position was not acceded to by the rebel authorities. Your inquiries are thus substantially answered. I enclose copies of the orders of the Commissary-General of Prisoners, regulating the conduct and treatment of prisoners of war, and the rations they now receive.* I am, very respectfully, Your obedient servant, M. C. MEIGS, Quartermaster-General. * Printed in this Appendix."], [213, "199 FORT DELAWARE. Testimony taken at Fort Delaware, June 21st, 1864 COMMISSIONERS PRESENT : Dr. Wallace, Judge Hare. Captain Gilbert S. Clark, sworn and examined : \u2014 I came to this post 18th March, 1862, and the Subsistence Department at this post has been under my charge since May, 1862. The rations were as follow : Bread \u2014 18 ounces per ration ; or, Corn Meal \u2014 20 ounces per ration. Beef \u2014 1 pound per ration ; or, Bacon or Pork- \u2014 \u00a7 pound per ration. Beans \u2014 8 quarts per one hundred men ; or, Hominy or Eice \u2014 10 pounds per one hundred men. Sugar \u2014 14 pounds per one hundred men. Eio Coffee\u2014 7 or 9 pounds per hundred men.

Molasses \u2014 4 quarts per one hundred men twice per week. Potatoes \u2014 1 pound per man, three times per week. When beans were issued, hominy or rice not issued. These were the rations to which the prisoners were"], [214, "200 APPENDIX. entitled. Bread was issued, in point of fact, and not corn meal. Fresh beef was issued, during this time, four times a week When we had to give them hard bread they received a pound. When fresh beef was given, a pound and a quarter was given, and a less proportion of salt meat. This was done by orders of the commanding officer, with a view to the sanitary condition of the men. According to instructions from the Commissary-General of Prisoners, a fund was created by selling all surplus rations, under regulations, and with this fund were pur chased vegetables in addition to the regular rations. The order referred to, under which this course was adopted, was as follows : CIRCULAR. \"V. A general fund, for the benefit of the prisoners, will be made by withholding from their rations all that can be spared without inconvenience to them, and selling this sur plus, under existing regulations, to the Commissary, who will hold the funds in his hands, and be accountable for them, subject to the commanding officer's order to cover purchases. The purchases with the fund will be made by or through the Quartermaster, with the approval or order of the commanding officer, the bills being paid by the Com missary, who will keep an account book, in which will be carefully entered all receipts and payments, with the vouchers; and he will keep the commanding officer ad vised, from time to time, of the amount of this fund. At the end of the month he will furnish the commanding offi cer with an account of the fund for the month, showing the receipts and disbursements, which account will be forwarded to- the Commissary-General of Prisoners, with the remarks of the commanding officer. With this fund will be pur chased all such articles as may be necessary for the health"], [215, "treatment of rebel prisoners. 201 and comfort of the prisoners, and which would otherwise have to be purchased by the Government: among these articles are all table furniture and cooking utensils, articles for policing purposes, bedticks and straw, the means ot improving or enlarging the barracks accommodation, extra pay to clerks who have charge of the camp, post-office, and who keep the accounts of moneys deposited with the com manding officer, &c, &c.\" The provisions, according to my return, actually issued, were the same as for the garrison troops. The rations detailed above were the rations actually given to the men. The amount drawn on the books, for their account, was larger \u2014 and as large as that issued to the garrison, with the excep tion of flour or bread, which was eighteen ounces instead of twenty -two ounces. When I say actually issued, I mean when entered on my returns as issued. The difference between the amount thus issued, and the amount given as above, was sold and converted into a fund for the benefit of the prisoners, as I have stated, according to the order of which I have given an extract. This fund was expended and applied for their use in the purchase of extra vegetables and articles of comfort. This course is pursued towards our own troops in camp and garrison ; the surplus which they do not use being sold for their benefit to the Commissary of Subsistence, and regularly entered, and the proceeds applied to their use. The surplus rations sold for the prisoners were about the same as those sold for the garrison at the same time, show ing that the amount actually consumed by the prisoners was about the same, per man, as that consumed by the o-arrison. When hard bread is issued, prisoners not unfre quently leave a portion of it on the table. A large amount of bread has been found stowed away by them in the bar racks. The rations are precisely the same as that used for garrison, and of a very good quality."], [216, "202 APPENDIX. My expenditures for vegetables alone, for the use of the prisoners, out of the fund arising from the sale of the sur plus rations, amounted, at times, as high as from $2,000 to $3,000 a month. For instance, I would buy extra quantities of potatoes and onions, turnips, cabbage, pickles, carrots. I have frequently asked my overseers if the prisoners complained of not having enough, and if they did, to give them more, and to let no man want, as I could afford to do from the savings. During all the time I have been here, I have scarcely heard a complaint. No material change was made in the rations given to the prisoners till the first of this month, (June, '64) ; since this date, the following has been the ration given the prisoners : The rations issued on the returns remained the same as before. The amount given was reduced to the following quantity, by order of the Secretary of War : \"B.\" \" RATION : \"Pork or Bacon, . . 10 ozs. (in lieu of fresh beef.)

This part of the ration will be allowed only for every other day.\" The difference between the ration given and the ration issued continues to be sold, and the proceeds applied to the benefit of the prisoners, as before. The consequence is that the surplus fund for their use is larger.

IX. With the Prison Fund may be purchased such arti cles not provided for by regulations as may be necessary for the health and proper condition of the prisoners, such as table furniture, cooking utensils, articles for policing, straw, the means of improving or enlarging the barracks or hospitals, &c. It will also be used to pay clerks, and other"], [222, "208 APPENDIX. employees engaged in labors connected with prisoners. No barracks or other structures will be erected or enlarged, and no alterations made, without first submitting a plan and estimate of the cost to the Commissary-General of Prisoners, to be laid before the Secretary of War for his approval ; and in no case will the services of clerks or of other employees be paid for without the sanction of the Commissary-General of Prisoners. Soldiers employed with such sanction will be allowed 40 cents per day when employed as clerks, stewards, or mechanics ; 25 cents a day when employed as laborers. X. It is made the duty of the Quartermaster, or, when there is none, the Commissary, under the orders of the Commanding Officer, to procure all articles required for the prisoners, and to hire clerks or other employees. All bills for service, or for articles purchased, will be certified by the Quartermaster, and will be paid by the Commissary on the order of the Commanding Officer, who is held responsible that all expenditures are for authorized pur poses. XL The Quartermaster will be held accountable for all property purchased with the Prison Fund, and he will make a return of it to the Commissary-General of Prisoners at the end of each calendar month, which will show the articles on hand on the first day of the month ; the articles purchased, issued and expended during the month; and the articles remaining on hand. The return will be sup ported by abstracts of the articles purchased, issued, and expended, certified by the Quartermaster, and approved by the Commanding Officer. XII. The Commanding Officer will cause requisitions to be made by his Quartermaster for such clothing as may be absolutely necessary for the prisoners, which requisition will be approved by him, after a careful inquiry as to the"], [223, "209 TREATMENT OF REBEL PRISONERS. necessity, and submitted for the approval of the Commis sary-General of Prisoners. The clothing will be issued by the Quartermaster to the prisoners, with the assistance and under the supervision of an officer detailed for the pur pose, whose certificate that the issue has been made in his presence will be the Quartermaster's voucher for the cloth ing issued. From the 30th of April to the 1st of October, neither drawers nor socks will be allowed, except to the sick. When army clothing is issued, buttons and trim mings will be taken off the coats, and the skirts will be cut so short that prisoners who wear them will not be mis taken for United States soldiers. XIII. The Sutler for the prisoners is entirely under the control of the Commanding Officer, who will require him to furnish the prescribed articles, and at reasonable rates. For this privilege the Sutler will be taxed a small amount by the Commanding Officer, according to the amount of his trade, which tax will be placed in the hands of the Com missary to make part of the Prison Fund. XIV. All money in possession of prisoners, or received by them, will be taken charge of by the Commanding Officer, who will give receipts for it to those to whom it belongs. Sales will be made to prisoners by the Sutler on orders on the Commanding Officer, which orders will be kept as vouchers in the settlement of the individual accounts. The Commanding Officer will procure proper books in which to keep an account of all moneys deposited in his hands, these accounts to be always subject to inspec tion by the Commissary -General of Prisoners, or other in specting officer. When prisoners are transferred from the post, the moneys belonging to them, with a statement of the amount due each, will be sent with them, to be turned over by the officer in charge to the officer to whom the prisoners are delivered, who will give receipts for the"], [224, "210 APPENDIX. money. When prisoners are paroled, their money will be returned to them. XV. All articles sent by friends to prisoners, if proper to be delivered, will be carefully distributed as the donors may request ; such as are intended for the sick passing through the hands of the Surgeon, who will be responsible for their proper use. Contributions must be received by an officer, who will be held responsible that they are delivered to the person for whom they are intended. All uniform clothing, boots, or equipments of any kind for military service, weapons of all kinds, and intoxicating liquors, including malt liquors, are among the contraband articles. The material for outer clothing should be gray, or some dark mixed color, and of inferior quality. Any excess of clothing, over what is required for immediate use, is con traband. XVI. When prisoners are seriously ill, their nearest relatives, being loyal, may be permitted to make them short visits; but under no other circumstances will visitors be admitted without the authority of the Commissary-Gen eral of Prisoners. At those places where the guard is inside the enclosure, persons having official business to transact with the Commander or other officer, will be admitted for such purposes, but will not be allowed to have any communication with the prisoners. XVII. Prisoners will be permitted to write and to re ceive letters, not to exceed one page of common letter paper each, provided the matter is strictly of a private nature. Such letters must be examined by a reliable non commissioned officer, appointed for that purpose by the Commanding Officer, before they are forwarded or deliv ered to the prisoners. X V ill.

The principal part of the clothing was issued in October and November, 1863, and every prisoner not having an overcoat and blanket of his own, was provided with one. All that were in want of clothing received it. The barracks were kept comfortable by stoves; no stint in fuel that I know of; the attendants kept the fires up."], [226, "212 APPENDIX.

Were the rations issued sufficient for their subsistence ?"], [227, "TREATMENT OF REBEL PRISONERS. 213 had they at any time saved any rations, and was there any waste of their rations at any time ? A. The rations issued to them were at all times sufficient for their subsistence ; and sometimes greatly in excess of what they could eat. In policing their barracks sometime ago we tore up the lower bunk boards, under which we found about eight (8) barrels of hard bread and meat, which they had secreted there, because there was more than they could eat. At that time we had only about three thousand prisoners here.

Many died also from wounds received in different engagements. Many, when brought here, were suffering from chronic diarrh\u0153a and other diseases. The general effect of our treatment of the prisoners at this post has resulted in great benefit to their physical condition. In reference to vaccination, being desirous of obtaining the true cause of its bad effects on their system, I inquired of them (the prisoners) the cause of it ; they stated that they had been vaccinated by their own men with impure matter.

At one time we turned the prisoners out, and found enough of crackers to have paved the barracks two crackers deep, and they are an average of five hundred feet.

They had five stoves within five hundred feet during winter, and were warm enough in their barracks. There has never been an order to fire at any man look ing out the windows, and no man has ever been fired at for looking out ; there have been five men shot ; three killed and two wounded here, since this has been a prison. One killed while in the river making his escape, about one hun dred yards from the shore, at night ; one killed for attempt ing to climb over the fence towards the river ; one man was wounded \u2014 he died since \u2014 for committing a nuisance on the bank contrary to rule, and was ordered by the sentry to stop. He called the sentry \" a Yankee son of a bitch,\" and would not stop. The ball wounded two men. The other one said that he deserved all he got. Another was killed accidentally, by the sentry shooting at one who was com mitting a nuisance, and who would not obey the order.

Should the sentinel detect any prisoner in violating these instructions, he must order him three distinct times to halt I and if the prisoner obeys the order, the sentinel must call for the Corporal of the Guard, and have the prisoner placed in arrest \u2014 but should the prisoner fail to halt, when so ordered, the sentinel must enforce his order by bayonet or ball.

The condition of the prisoners, upon arriving here, was that generally of men suffering from over-exertion and bad diet; chronic diarrh\u0153a and scurvy prevalent among them ; they improved very mate rially shortly after their arrival here. The sanitary conditions here were such as to be condu cive to their health. Prisoners who arrived here from Vicksburg and the Mississippi Valley were laboring under miasmatic influences, under which a great number of them died. From their condition, I should judge they had been on a diet of salt meat. Some of the men arrived here in a good condition of health. The men from Gettysburg were generally in good health, though they soon broke down, showing the effect of their violent exertions ; they rallied again under good food and good clothing. The condition of the men brought here within the last few months, captured in Virginia, has been better than that of those brought here heretofore. A large number of the men had never been vaccinated, and many others imperfectly so. The scars were imperfect, in my judgment. They vacci nated themselves in the barracks with pen-knives, after their arrival here, producing diseases of the blood and skin. In my experience, the proportion of the unvacci nated men, among the prisoners, is far greater than in our own army, for I have never known of an unvaccinated man in our army. I consider the amount of food and clothing allowed to prisoners here, during the past winter, reasonably sufficient f jr the preservation of life and health. J don't know of any man who has suffered from a want of food or clothing, and unable to procure them, on proper representations. I do know of one man who was brought into the hospital last winter, during a severe spell, severely frost-bitten. I"], [232, "218 APPENDIX. don't know how this occurred. This is the only instance that has ccme to my knowledge. The men sent away from here were sometimes sick and sometimes well ; they were in general well ; and the physi cal condition of the well men was good. The sick were sent away under special orders, going as sick. The order was from Surgeon-General Hammond ; it was not an order to send away any who could not bear the journey; it was left to my discretion who to send away, aud I sent none who I believed would die on the passage ; I was careful about that. I think the treatment of the sick prisoners here is equal to the treatment of our own sick men anywhere.

They would frequently persist in doing it, although there was fresh water provided for them. They did this to save them selves from the trouble of going about a hundred yards for fresh water. They would dig little wells for the water, a few inches deep ; I think that water produced sickness, though I frequently cautioned them, and at different times. This was two years ago. For a year the water has been brought here in large quantities by boats. There are 30,000 gallons of water brought here now a day, besides what rain water is caught.

I was on duty in this hospital when the last load of rebel prisoners arrived, during the latter part of July, 1863. Some were lodged in pavilions, and some in tents, which were in excellent order. The prisoners had not been robbed or deprived of any of their private property, so far as my knowledge extends; on the contrary, the majority of patients under my charge possessed money, brought with them from the South to the hospital, and were never deprived of it. They came in a filthy, horrible condition. Their dirty garments were removed and burned, and new hospital cloth ing furnished them at the expense of the United States Gov ernment, after they had been thoroughly cleansed and washed. Their physical condition was bad in the extreme when they arrived; they were run down, and were the worst body of wounded men it has ever been my lot to see. I had ten tents under my charge, which contained ninety"], [235, "221 TREATMENT of rebel prisoners. four rebel patients and nurses. The tents were twenty-eight by fifteen feet. The pavilions were one hundred and ninety six feet in length, twenty-three feet in breadth, and twelve feet in height to the plate, and contained not more than eighty patients. During the ensuing cold weather the prisoners were re moved to the pavilions, and had all necessary fuel and warm clothing. I have never heard of any of the prisoners suffering from cold or exposure, so as to require medical treatment, nor of any having been frozen to death. They were allowed, for exercise and recreation, the whole island inside of the line of sentries, having the same liberty, rations, diet and medical treatment, as the Federal sick and wounded have always had. No rebel prisoners were ever fired upon, shot, or wounded, when on the Island, from any apprehension of their escap ing, or from any other cause. The supply of drinking water was of a good quality and abundant; and ice was supplied with liberal profusion, and sufficiency of water for washing, with plentiful allowances of soap, as well as combs, for their own private use. The physical condition of the rebel prisoners, upon leav ing the island, was very good, except a few cases of unhealed wounds. AUG. VAN CORTLANDT, M. D.

The dimensions of the tents were twenty-eight feet by fifteen feet ; the pavilions were one hundred and ninety-six feet in length, twenty three feet in breadth, and twelve feet in height to the plate ; not sealed over, and with numerous ventilators on the ridges. The tents were arranged to contain ten patients each, the pavilions to contain eighty; the number of pa tients never exceeded these numbers in either. The prisoners had not been robbed by our men, as most of them had money, some had gold, greenbacks, and Con federate paper. They were in rags, barefooted and bareheaded when they came, were frightfully filthy, and covered with vermin. Within three or four hours after their arrival, they had all been stripped of their rags, washed, and after being sup plied with clean linen, placed in clean and well-aired beds. Full suits of clothing, consisting of coats, pants, drawers, shirts, shoes aud stockings, were subsequently issued to them by the United States Quartermaster. To distinguish them from our own soldiers, the buttons and six inches of the skirt of the coat were cut off. Those who remained during the cold weather were abundantly supplied with fuel and warm clothing, and none required medical or surgical treatment in consequence of exposure to the cold ; none were frozen to death. They were allowed to go fishing or clamming, as they pleased, when they first came, till several escaped, when a line of sentinels was placed around the island upon the beach, inside of which they enjoyed all the privileges al lowed to the Federal patients in the hospital.

In my intercourse with the prisoners, I was guided sys tematically by the same rules with which I visited Union soldiers. The prisoners were equally well lodged with our own men. I remarked at the time of their arrival how neat and comfortable a provision had been made in the tents and pavilions for their comfort, with an ample supply of beds and bedding. I met the first transport at Philadelphia, and returned on the same with them to David's Island. The prisoners w< re in a most filthy condition, miserably clad, and covered /An vermin.

In the prosecution of my duties I was frequently present at their dinners, which were ample, superior, both as respects quantity and quality, to anything I have ever seen in hospital diet. The diet furnished to them was superior even to that of our own patients. This resulted from the fact that many little luxuries were fur nished by private donation. There were other comforts and conveniences afforded them beyond those of food, clothing, and shelter. A library of two thousand volumes, that had been pre viously used by our own soldiers, was at once thrown open to them, and every facility afforded for the use of the volumes. Being present as librarian, and taking each man's name as he received his book, the library was used by them far more than by our own people. As had been my practice, I went through the tents and pavilions with bibles and prayer books, making the special inquiry to every man, \" Are you supplied ?\" And furnishing books in all cases where they were required. Religious services were held in the chapel twice every 15"], [240, "226 APPENDIX. Sunday, and two or three times during the week, at which they were invited to be present, and attended in such num bers that the chapel was always crowded, the capacity of the chapel being three hundred, and on some occasions numbers stood at the windows during the entire service. I was supervisor of the post office, and officially appointed to examine the contents of letters, which were mailed and forwarded on my approval. Paper and envelopes were fur nished gratuitously, and post stamps when needed, were supplied to the extent of one hundred and fifty dollars, to my knowledge, gratuitously. From three hundred to five hundred letters were forwarded daily after the first arrival of prisoners. The common expression in their letters as to their con dition was that \"we have everything we need, and could not be better off.\" Funeral service was always performed over the dead, using the service of the Protestant Episcopal Church over the remains of the dead.

I was stationed at Johnson's Island, three miles from San dusky, from the last week of October, 1863, to the last week of January, 1864. My duty was to attend to our men guarding the rebel prisoners, and also to attend at the Smallpox Hospital for rebel prisoners, and at the Post Hos pital for our garrison ; my position enabled me to see the general condition and the general treatment of the prisoners. There could not be a more healthy or pleasant place than this island. Kelly's Island, a popular place of resort for pleasure and health, is about six miles from this island, and no better for these objects. The buildings were good ; in good order ; they were new ; say two years old ; convenient and comfortable ; they might have been better ventilated ; the buildings were frame, and lined inside ; they had rows of bunks, as in barracks, in three tiers \u2014 just the same as our men have in most of our barracks. The rebel prisoners all had blankets, either their own or furnished by the United States Government, and were gene rally furnished with clothing by the United States Govern ment \u2014 pants, shoes, hats, blouses, and underclothing and"], [242, "228 APPENDIX. stockings, \u2014 until a short time before I left, then these were furnished to those only who actually needed them. I have several times seen of an afternoon boxes carted in, and these articles distributed from the boxes among the prisoners, according to their wants. I was there in extremely cold weather, when the supplies were teamed on the ice from the main land to Johnson's Island, a distance of three miles ; the prisoners were pro vided against this severe weather by wood hauled every day for their use in stoves. I consider that the wood was sufficient for comfortable supply, except for, say two or possibly three days, when the teams were engaged in bringing lumber and provisions for additional troops ; during these two or three days the supply of wood was scant, and was the subject of complaint. No prisoners were frost-bitten or came under medical treatment from cold and exposure, except some who at tempted to escape. They all fared as well in this respect as our men do in barracks generally. The sick men all had ticks filled with straw as beds ; the hospital building for the rebels was bned and plastered. There was abundant supply of good water from the lake by pipes and pumps ; when the pipes froze they could go to the lake, under guard, and supply themselves, bringing it up in suitable vessels ; they always had plenty of water to wash themselves and their clothes. The rations of the prisoners were the same as those furnished to our own soldiers according to regulations. The prisoners did not consume all their rations, for I know that there was a large prison fund formed from the savings. During the hours of the day the prisoners were allowed to be in the open air as much as they pleased ; there was abundant room for them all to take as much exercise as they required for health ; they played games in the open air. The surgeon in charge treated the sick rebels as he"], [243, "TREATMENT OF REBEL PRISONERS. 229 treated our sick; there was no difference at all, except when special articles of diet were sent to our men by their friends. Some four hundred and sixty rebel privates were sent to some other prison in November ; most of them had been on Johnson's Island for some months ; when they left, taking them as a whole, their physical condition was excellent.

What has been and is now your position in the army of the United States ? A. I am Surgeon of the 128th Regiment 0. V.

I came to the island in February, 1862. The first prisoners came in April, 1862. I have had medical supervision of the prison from then until now. Q. What is your opinion of Johnson's Island as to health and salubrity ?"], [244, "230 appendix. A. I believe Johnson's Island to be as favorable to health as the climate of Newport or Saratoga in summer, and as that of Cincinnati or Dayton in winter. The latitude is about 411\u00b0 North, longitude 82\u00b0 42' West. Height of lake above tide-water five hundred and sixty-five feet. The island rests upon a bed of Devonian limestone, which rises gradually from the shore to the centre, terminating in a ridge of limestone rock, thus affording complete natural drainage. The water used is principally that of the bay, which comes in fresh constantly from Lake Erie. Q. What diseases, if any, are peculiar to Johnson's Island or the neighboring islands in Lake Erie ? A. I know of no diseases peculiar to those islands or preva lent in them. Johnson's Island is a small one, containing only about three hundred acres of land, and previous to the estab lishment of the prison, if I am correctly informed, was not inhabited by more than one family at a time; but the Peninsula, with Kelley's Island and the Put-in-Bay Islands, have been inhabited for between thirty and forty years. I have conversed frequently with some of the oldest citizens of the peninsula and the islands, but have never heard them speak of any liability to diseases, but such as is common to other parts of Ohio. Q. Is there any truth in the assertion made by rebel authorities that residence on the island for a few months produces in a great number of prisoners dangerous and fatal pulmonary disorders? Not the slightest. Q. What has been the rate of mortality among the prisoners? A. In 1862 \u2014 from April to December inclusive \u2014 the number of deaths was thirty-seven. During the year 1863 measles and smallpox were brought into the prison by prisoners sent from Alton and other prisons, and many wounded at the battles of Gettysburg, augmenting our mor tality list above what it would otherwise have reached. The number of deaths for 1863 was ninety-seven. This makes,"], [245, "TREATMENT of rebel prisoners. 231 from the time of the first arrival of prisoners in April, 1862, to January 1st, 1864, (twenty-one months,) a mortality list of one hundred and thirty-four, out of an aggregate of six thousand four hundred and ten, received into the prison in that time. As there were exchanges and removals of prisoners, the number in prison never exceeded twenty seven hunch-ed at any one time* Many of the prisoners came here with health impaired, by bad diet, exposure, and often by wounds received in battle. The bill of mortality owes little to the climate of the post, when we consider that men in prison, away from home and friends, are weighed down by anxieties and despondency, thus making the treat ment of disease more difficult. Q. Please state the number of prisoners now at the post ? A. About two thousand three hundred and six.f Q. Please state the number of deaths during the past two months. A. In the month of May there were five deaths; in the month of June only one. Q. What accommodations are provided for the care of the sick ? A. The hospital building is one hundred and twenty-six by thirty feet, with a transverse hall six and a half feet wide in the centre. There are four wards, each forty-eight bv thirty feet. There are eighty beds in all, giving to each patient, when the wards are full, seven hundred and twenty cubic feet of atmospheric air. The dispensary is furnished with all the medicines and stimulants furnished to hospitals for our own soldiers, and more than double the quantity is used by prisoners than by the same number of our troops. I have always had the assistance of competent Confederate surgeons, who cheerfully aid by giving their time to this duty. When there are no commissioned surgeons in prison, * The average number of prisoners for the entire of the year 18C3, was eleven hundred and fifteen. f In May, 1864, there were two thousand one hundred and thirty four, and in June, 1864, two thousand three hundred and nine."], [246, "232 APPENDIX. there are surgeons holding commissions in the line who do this duty. The cooking for the hospital is done by the most experienced and skilful cooks we can find in the prison. In addition to rations, the sick are furnished with flour, potatoes, corn-meal, milk, butter, eggs, chickens, tea, &c., &c. The bedding is amply sufficient to make each patient com fortable. A pest-house is built outside the prison, to which all cases of smallpox, measles or other contagions are removed on first development. J. WOODBRIDGE, Surgeon 128th O. V.

How long have you held that position ? A. Since the 17th of May, 1864. Q. What is your opinion of the general healthfulness and salubrity of Johnson's Island ? A. The general condition of the troops and prisoners of war at this post has been unusually good and healthy. The hospital in the prison, during the past two months, scarcely ever had more than thii'ty inmates among an aggregate number of two thousand one hundred prisoners of war. The prevailing diseases, during this time, were diarrh\u0153a, acute and chronic ; a few cases of dysentery, and a small number of intermittent fever. I consider the island as healthy as any locality I have ever visited. Q. Have you known any undue tendency to pulmonary"], [247, "TREATMENT OF REBEL PRISONERS. 233 disorders on this or the adjoining islands, or any part of the surrounding country? A. I have not, at least not during the time that I have been stationed here.

Bush, Notary Public in and for Erie County, Ohio."], [248, "234 APPENDIX. Deposition taken at Kelley's Island. George C. Huntington examined: Q. How long have you resided on Kelley's Island ? A. Since the Fall of 1838, with the exception of one year, from the fall of 1844 to the fall of 1845. Have been ac quainted on the Island since 1835. Q. What means have you of furnishing a statement of the character of the climate and sanitary condition of Kelley's Island, and the neighboring islands, and the sur rounding country? A. I have been in the habit, during the entire period of my residence on the island, of noting extremes of tempera ture, and such casual phenomena as would, in my opinion, have any bearing on the general health of the place; and, for more than five years past, have made three records daily of everything connected with the changes of the weather, in the manner prescribed by, and under the direction of, the Smithsonian Institution. Q. Please state the latitude, longitude, and height above tide-water of Kelley's Island \u2014 its population, and the gene ral character of the island for salubrity? A. My place of observation is in latitude 41\u00b0 35' 44\" N. longitude 82\u00b0 42' 32\" W. The level of Lake Erie is 565 feet above tide-water, and the island may in some places rise fifty or sixty feet above the level of the lake ; but I think the mean height of the island would not vary much from twenty-five feet above the level of the lake. The population, in April last, was six hundred and fifty-one. As to the salubrity of the climate, the matter will be best deter mined by the statistics given in answer to the next question."], [249, "TREATMENT OF REBEL PRISONERS. 235 Q. What has been the per centage of mortality, annually, on your island ? A. In answer to this question I give an abstract from the records of the \"Cemetery Association.\" This association was organized in May, 1853, since which time the whole number of interments has been ... 43 From this deduct, lost from vessels and washed ashore, 3 Died in Nashville, from wounds in battle, . . 1 \u2014 4 Whole number of interments in 11 years, . 38 To this add, died here and taken elsewhere for interment, 5 Whole number of deaths in 11 years, . 43 From diseases reported as follows: \u2014 Killed by premature blast 1, drowned 2, . .3 Old age 3, intemperance 1, dropsy 1, . .5 Still-born and infants but a few days old, . . 8 Dysentery and summer complaint, . . 9 Inflammation of bowels, . . . .3 Diseases affecting respiratory organs, '. . 5 Throat affection, age 76, age 50, . . .2 Fevers, (one contracted in army hospital,) . . 3 Childbirth 1, congestion of brain 1, . .2 Fits 1, not specified 2, . . . .3 \u2014 43 The average population of the island for this period of eleven years has been, as appears by the returns of the township assessor, 428, which would give an annual mor tality of 3.9 ; but if we deduct casualties 3, still-born and infants, which, although born alive, had not vitality enough fairly to commence the journey of life, 8; and one from disease contracted in hospital in Nashville, 1, it will reduce the number of deaths properly chargeable to disease and old age, to thirty-one, or an annual mortality of 2.82 in a population of 428. This would be an annual mortality from all causes of one per cent., and from disease, in-"], [250, "236 APPENDIX. eluding old age, an annual mortality of less than seventy three-hundredths of one per cent. (0.724.) By comparing these results with the tables of mortality in different sec tions of the country, the salubrity of our climate and the immunity from the ordinary diseases of the country en joyed by the inhabitants of this island as compared with other localities, may be easily deduced. Q. What is the distance of Kelley's from Johnson's Island, and is there any difference in the physical or sanitary peculiarities of the two islands? A. Johnson's Island is about seven miles nearly due south from Kelley's Island, and I am not aware of any natural causes which should make any difference in the salubrity of climate or sanitary condition of the two locali ties, unless the difference in the water between Sandusky Bay and the open lake (the latter being considered rather more free from impurities) might be considered a difference, so far as it is used for culinary purposes or as a beverage. Q. Is there any undue tendency to pulmonary disorders among the inhabitants of these islands ? A. By reference to the answer to a preceding question, it will be seen that the whole number of deaths from diseases affecting the respiratory organs in a period of eleven years, and in a population averaging four hundred and twenty eight, was but five, and of this number one was a transient person; leaving but four cases in eleven year's among those who could be properly called residents. Q. Has Johnson's Island ever had a bad repute for un healthiness ? A. I have never heard Johnson's Island called unhealthy. Q. Have you ever known any very fatal diseases among the inhabitants of Lake Erie? A. The Asiatic cholera has passed through the lake region as an epidemic, four times I think, since it first made its appearance on this continent in 1832. I am not aware of any other very fatal diseases having prevailed in the lake region since my first acqanintance with it in 1830."], [251, "237 TREATMENT OF REBEL PRISONERS.

Was captured with about eight hundred Federal troops, in front of Petersburg, on the 22d of June, 1864. We were kept at Petersburg two days, at Richmond, Belle Isle, three days, then conveyed by rail to Lynchburg. Marched seventy-five miles to Danville, thence by rail to Andersonville, Georgia. At Petersburg we were treated fairly, being under the guard of old soldiers of an Alabama regiment ; at Richmond we came under the authority of the notorious and inhuman Major Turner, and the equally notori ous Home Guard. Our ration was a pint of beans, four ounces of bread, and three ounces of meat a day. Another batch"], [274, "260 SUPPLEMENT. of prisoners joining us, we left Richmond sixteen hundred strong. All blankets, haversacks, canteens, money, valuables of every kind, extra clothing, and in some cases, the last shirt and drawers had been previously taken from us. At Lynchburg we were placed under the Home Guard, officered by Major and Captain Moffett. The march to Dan ville was a weary and painful one of five days, under a torrid sun, many of us falling helpless by the way, and soon filling the empty wagons of our train. On the first day we received a little meat, but the sum of our rations for the five days was thirteen crackers. During the six days by rail to Andersonville, meat was given us twice, and the daily ration was four crackers. On entering the Stockade Prison, we found it crowded with twenty-eight thousand of our fellow- soldiers. By crowded, I mean that it was difficult to move in any direction without jostling and being jostled. This prison is an open space, sloping on both sides, originally seventeen acres, now twenty-five acres, in the shape of a parallelogram, without trees or shelter of any kind. The soil is sand over a bottom of clay. The fence is made of upright trunks of trees, about twenty feet high, near the top of which are small platforms, where the guards are stationed. Twenty feet inside and parallel to the fence is a light railing, forming the \"dead line,\" beyond which the projection of a foot or finger is sure to bring the deadly bullet of the sentinel. Through the grounds, at nearly right-angles Avith the longer sides, runs or rather creeps a stream through an artifi cial channel, varying from five to six feet in width, the water about ankle deep, and near the middle of the inclosure, spreading out into a swamp of about six acres, filled with refuse wood, stumps, and debris of the camp. v Before enter ing this inclosure, the stream, or more properly sewer, passes through the camp of the guards, receiving from this source, and others farther up, a large amount of the vilest material, even the contents of the sink. The water is of a"], [275, "261 PRISON AT ANDERSONVILLE, GEORGIA."], [276, ""], [277, "SUFFERINGS OF UNION PRISONERS AT ANDERSONVILLE. 263 dark color, and an ordinary glass would collect a thick sediment. This was our only drinking and cooking water. It was our custom to filter it as best we could, through our remnants of haversacks, shirts and blouses. Wells had been dug, but the water either proved so productive of diarrh\u0153a, or so limited in quantity that they were of no general use. The cook-house was situated on the stream , just outside the stockade, and its refuse of decaying offal was thrown into the water, a greasy coating covering much of the surface. To these was added the daily large amount of base matter from the camp itself. There was a system of policing, but the means was so limited, and so large a number of the men was rendered irresolute and depressed by imprisonment, that the work was very imperfectly done. One side of the swamp was naturally used as a sink, the men usually going out some distance into the water. Under the summer sun this place early became corruption too vila for description, the mass breeding disgusting life, so that the surface of the water moved as with a gentle breeze. The new-comers, on reaching this, would exclaim : \" Is this hell ?\" yet they soon would become callous, and enter unmoved the horrible rottenness. The rebel authorities never removed any filth. There was seldom any visitation by the officers in charge. Two surgeons were at one time sent by President Davis to inspect the camp, but a walk through a small section gave them all the information they desired, and we never saw them again. The guards usually numbered about sixty-four \u2014 eight at each end, and twenty -four on a side. On the outside, within three hundred yards, were fortifications, on high ground overlooking and perfectly commanding us, mounting twenty four twelve-pound Napoleon Parrotts. We were never per mitted to go outside, except at times, in small squads, to gather our fire-wood. During the building of the cook house, a few, who were carpenters, were ordered out to assist. Our only shelter from the sun and rain and night dews,"], [278, "264 SUPPLEMENT. was what we could make by stretching over us our coats or scraps of blankets, which a few had, but generally there was no attempt by day or night to protect ourselves. The rations consisted of eight ounces of corn bread, (the cob being ground with the kernel,) and generally sour, two ounces of condemned pork, offensive in appearance and smell. Occasionally, about twice a week, two tablespoonfuls of rice, and in place of the pork the same amount (two table spoonfuls) of molasses was given us about twice a month* This ration was brought into camp about four o'clock, P. M., and thrown from the wagons to the ground, the men being arranged in divisions of two hundred and seventy, subdi vided into squads of nineties and thirties. It was the custom to consume the whole ration at once, rather than save any for the next day. The distribution being often unequal some would lose the rations altogether. We were allowed no dish or cooking utensil of any kind. On opening the camp in the winter, the first two thousand prisoners were allowed skillets, one to fifty men, but these were soon taken away. To the best of my knowledge, information and belief, our ration was in quality a starving one, it being either too foul to be touched or too raw to be digested. The cook-house went into operation about May 10, prior to which we cooked our own rations.

In addition to the utter inability of many to do this, through debility and sickness, we never had a supply of wood. I have often seen men with a little bag of meal in hand, gathered from several rations, starving to death for want of wood, and in desperation would mix the raw ma terial with water and try to eat it. The clothing of the men was miserable in the extreme. Very few had shoes of any kind, not two thousand had coats and pants, and those were late ..corners. More than one-half were indecently exposed, and many were naked. The usual punishment was to place the men in the stocks, outside, near the Captain's quarters. If a man was missing at roll-call, the squad of ninety to which he belonged was deprived of the ration. The \"dead-line\" bullet, already referred to, spared no offender. One poor fellow, just from Sherman's army \u2014 his name was Roberts \u2014 was trying to wash his face near the \" dead-line\" railing, when he slipped on the clayey bottom, and fell with his head just outside the fatal border. We shouted to him, but it was too late\u2014 \"another guard would have a furlough,\" the men said. It was a common belief among our men, arising from state ments made by the guard, that General Winder, in com mand, issued an order that any one of the guard who should shoot a Yankee outside of the \"dead-line\" should have a month's furlough, but there probably was no truth in this. About two a day were thus shot, some being cases of suicide, brought on by mental depression or physical misery, the poor fellows throwing themselves, or madly rushing outside the \"line.\" The mental condition of a large portion of the men was melancholy, beginning in despondency and tending to a kind of stolid and idiotic indifference. Many spent much time in arousing and encouraging their fellows, but hundreds were lying about motionless, or stalking vacantly to and fro, quite beyond any help which could be given them within their prison walls. These cases were frequent among"], [280, "266 SUPPLEMENT. those who had been imprisoned but a short time. There were those who were captured at the first Bull Run, July 1861, and had known Belle Isle from the first, yet had pre served their physical and mental health to a wonderful degree. Many were wise and resolute enough to keep them selves occupied \u2014 some in cutting bone and wood ornaments, making their knives out of iron hoops \u2014 others in manu facturing ink from the rust from these same hoops, and with rude pens sketching pr imitating bank notes or any sample that would involve long and patient execution. Letters from home very seldom reached us, and few had any means of writing. In the early summer, a large batch of letters \u2014 five thousand we were told \u2014 arrived, having been accumulating somewhere for many months. These were brought into camp by an officer, under orders to collect ten cents on each \u2014 of course most were returned, and we heard no more of them. One of my companions saw among them three from his parents, but he was unable to pay the charge. According to the rules of transmission of letters over the lines, these letters must have already paid ten cents each to the rebel government. As far as we saw General Winder and Captain Wirtz, the former was kind and considerate in his manners, the latter harsh, though not without kindly feelings. It is a melancholy and mortifying fact, that some of our trials came from our own men. At Belle Isle and Ander sonville there were among us a gang of desperate men, ready to prey on their fellows. Not only thefts and robberies, but even murders were committed. Affairs became so serious at Camp Sumter that an appeal was made to General Winder, who authorized an arrest and trial by a criminal court. Eighty-six were arrested, and six were hung, beside others who were severely punished. These proceedings effected a marked change for the better.

He has twenty-five assistants, besides those detailed to examine for admittance to the hospital. This examination was made in a small stockade attached to the main one, to the inside door of which the sick came or were brought by their comrades, the number to be removed being limited. Lately, in consideration of the rapidly increasing sickness, it was extended to one hundred and fifty daily. That this was too small an allowance is shown by the fact that the deaths within our stockade were from thirty to forty a day. I have seen one hundred and fifty bodies waiting passage to the \" dead house,\" to be buried with those who died in hos pital. The average of deaths through the earlier months was thirty a day : at the time I left, the average was over one hundred and thirty, and one day the record showed one hundred and forty-six. The proportion of deaths from starvation, not including those consequent on the diseases originating in the char acter and limited quantity of food, such as diarrh\u0153a, dysen tery and scurvy, I cannot state; but, to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, there were scores every month. We could, at any time, point out many for whom such a fate was inevitable, as they lay or feebly walked, mere skeletons, whose emaciation exceeded the examples given in Leslie's Illustrated for June 18, 1864. For ex ample : in some cases the inner edges of the two bones of the arms, between the elbow and the wrist, with the inter mediate blood vessels, were plainly visible when held toward the light. The ration, in quantity, was perhaps barely sufficient to sustain life, and the cases of starvation were generally those whose stomachs could not retain what had become entirely indigestible. For a man to find, on waking, that his comrade by his side was dead, was an occurrence too common to be noted. I have seen death in almost all the forms of the hospital and battle-field, but the daily scenes in Camp Sumtcr"], [282, "268 SUPPLEMENT. exceeded in the extremity of misery all my previous experi ence. The work of burial is performed by our own men, under guard and orders, twenty-five bodies being placed in a single pit, without head-boards, and the sad duty performed with indecent haste. Sometimes our men were rewarded for this work with a few sticks of fire-wood, and I have known them to quarrel over a dead body for the job. Dr. White is able to give the patients a diet but little better than the prison rations \u2014 a little flour porridge, arrow root, whiskey and wild or hog tomatoes. In the way of medicine, I saw nothing but camphor, whiskey, and a decoction of some kind of bark \u2014 white oak, I think. He often expressed his regret that he had not more medicines. The limitation of military orders, under which the surgeon in charge was placed, is shown by the following occurrence : A supposed private, wounded in the thigh, was under treat ment in the hospital, when it was discovered that he was a major of a colored regiment. The assistant-surgeon, under whose immediate charge he was, proceeded at once, not only to remove him, but to kick him out, and he was returned to the stockade, to shift for himself as well as he could. Dr. White could not or did not attempt to restore him. After entering on my duties at the hospital, I was occasionally favored with double rations and some wild tomatoes. A few of our men succeeded, in spite of the closest examination of our clothes, in secreting some green backs, and with these were able to buy useful articles at exorbitant prices : \u2014 a tea-cup of flour at one dollar ; eggs, three to six dollars a dozen; salt, four dollars a pound; molasses, thirty dollars a gallon; nigger beans, a small, inferior article, (diet of the slaves and pigs, but highly relished by us,) fifty cents a pint.

Tunneling was once attempted on a large scale, but on the afternoon preceding the night fixed on for escape, an officer rode in and announced to us that the plot was dis covered, and from our huge pen we could see on the hill above us the regiments just arriving to strengthen the guard.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Confederate States Prisc Charleston, S. O, August \u2014 , 186*. To the President of the United States : The condition of the enlisted men belonging to the Union armies, now prisoners to the Confederate rebel forces, is such that it becomes our duty, and the duty of every com missioned officer, to make known the facts in the case to the Government of the United States, and to use every honora ble effort to secure a general exchange of prisoners, thereby relieving thousands of our comrades from the horror now surrounding them. For some time past there has been a concentration of prisoners from all parts of the rebel territory to the State of Georgia \u2014 the commissioned officers being confined at Macon, and the enlisted men at Andersonville. Recent movements of the Union armies under General Sherman have compelled the removal of prisoners to other points, and it is now understood that they will be removed to Savannah, Georgia, and Columbus and Charleston, South Carolina. But no change of this kind holds out any prospect of relief to our poor men. Indeed, as the locali ties selected are far more unhealthy, there must be an increase rather than a diminution of suffering. Colonel"], [286, "272 supplement. Hill, provost marshal general, Confederate States army, at Atlanta, stated to one of the undersigned that there were thirty-five thousand prisoners at Andersonville, and by all accounts from the United States soldiers who have been confined there the number is not overstated by him. These thirty-five thousand are confined in a field of some thirty acres, enclosed by a board fence, heavily guarded. About one-third have various kinds of indifferent shelter ; but upwards of thirty thousand are wholly without shelter, or even shade of any kind, and are exposed to the storms and rains, which are of almost daily occurrence ; the cold dews of the night, and the more terrible effects of the sun striking with almost tropical fierceness upon their unprotected heads. This mass of men jostle and and crowd each other up and down the limits of their enclosure, in storms or sun, and others he down upon the pitiless earth at night with no other covering than the clothing upon their backs, few of them having even a blanket. Upon entering the prison every man is deliberately stripped of money and other property, and as no clothing or blankets are ever supplied to their prisoners by the rebel authorities, the condition of the apparel of the soldiers, just from an active campaign, can be easily imagined. Thousands are without pants or coats, and hundreds without even a pair of drawers to cover their nakedness. To these men, as indeed to all prisoners, there is issued three-quarters of a pound of bread or meal, and one-eighth of a pound of meat per day. This is the entire ration, and upon it the prisoner must five or die. The meal is often unsifted and sour, and the meat such as in the North is con signed to the soapmaker. Such are the rations upon which Union soldiers are fed by the rebel authorities, and by which they are barely holding on to life. But to starvation and exposure to sun and storm, add the sickness which prevails to a most alarming and terrible extent. On an average, one hundred die daily. It is impossible that any Union soldier should know all the facts pertaining to this"], [287, "273 memorial to the president. terrible mortality, as they are not paraded by the rebel authorities. Such statement as the following, made by -, speaks eloquent testimony. Said he : \" Of twelve of us who were captured six died, four are in the hospital, and I never expect to see them again. There are but two of us left.\" In 1862, at. Montgomery, Alabama, under far more favorable circumstances, the prisoners being protected by sheds, from one hundred and fifty to two hun dred were sick from diarrh\u0153a and chills, out of seven hun dred. The same per centage would give seven thousand sick at Andersonville. It needs no comment, no efforts at word painting, to make such a picture stand oui boldly in most horrible colors. Nor is this all. Among the ill-fated of the many who have suffered amputation in consequence of injuries received before capture, sent from rebel hospitals before their wounds were healed, there are eloquent witnesses of the barbarities of which they are victims. If to these facts is added this, that nothing more demoralizes soldiers and develops the evil passions of man than starvation, the terrible condition of Union prisoners at Andersonville can be readily imagined. They are fast losing hope, and becoming utterly reckless of life. Numbers, crazed by their sufferings, wander about in a state of idiocy; others deliberately cross the \"dead line,\" and are remorselessly shot down. In behalf of these men we most earnestly appeal to the President of the United States. Few of them have been captured except in the front of battle, in the deadly en counter, and only when overpowered by numbers. They constitute as gallant a portion of oar armies as carry our banners any where. If released, they would soon return to ao-ain do vigorous battle for our cause. We are told that the only obstacle in the way of exchange is the status of enlisted negroes captured from our armies, the United States claiming that the cartel covers all who serve under its flag, and the Confederate States refusing to consider the colored soldiers, heretofore slaves, as prisoners of war. 18"], [288, "274 supplement. We beg leave to suggest some facts bearing upon the question of exchange, which we would urge upon this con sideration. Is it not consistent with the national honor, without waiving the claim that the negro soldiers shall be treated as prisoners of war, to effect an exchange of the white soldiers ? The two classes are treated differently by the enemy. The whites are confined in such prisons as Libby and Andersonville, starved and treated with a bar barism unknown to civilized nations. The blacks, on the contrary, are seldom imprisoned. They are distributed among the citizens, or employed on government works. Under these circumstances they receive enough to eat and are worked no harder than they have been accustomed to be. They are neither starved or killed off by the pestilence in the dungeons of Richmond and Charleston. It is true they are again made slaves ; but their slavery is freedom and happi ness compared with the cruel existence imposed upon our gallant men. They are not bereft of hope, as are the white soldiers, dying by piece-meal. Their chances of escape are tenfold greater than those of the white soldiers, and their condition, in all its lights, is tolerable in comparison with that of the prisoners of war now languishing in the dens and pens of Secession. While, therefore, believing the claims of our Government, in matters of exchange, to be just, we are profoundly im pressed with the conviction that the circumstances of the two classes of soldiers are so widely different that the Gov ernment can honorably consent to an exchange, waiving for a time the established principle justly claimed to be appli cable in the case. Let thirty-five thousand suffering, starving, and dying enlisted men aid this appeal. By prompt and decided action in their behalf thirty-five thousand heroes will be made happy. For the eighteen hundred commis sioned officers now prisoners we urge nothing. Although desirous of returning to our duty, we can bear imprison ment with more fortitude if the enlisted men, whose sufferings we know to bo intolerable, were restored to liberty and life."], [289, "THE EXCHANGE QUESTION Letter of Major-General Butler, United States Commissioner of Exchange, to Col. Ould, the Confederate Commissioner. Headquarters Department of Virginia and North Carolina, In the Field, August \u2014 , 1864. Hon. Robert Ould, Commissioner of Exchange. Sir : \u2014 Your note to Major Mulford, Assistant Agent of Exchange, under date of 10th August, has been referred to me. You therein state that Major Mulford has several times proposed \" to exchange prisoners respectively held by the two belligerents, officer for officer and man for man,\" and that \" the offer has also been made by other officials having charge of matters connected with the exchange of prisoners,\" and that \" this proposal has been heretofore declined by the Confederate authorities.\" That you now \"consent to the above proposition, and agree to deliver to you (Major Mul ford) the prisoners held in captivity by the Confederate authorities, provided you agree to deliver an equal number of officers and men. As equal numbers are delivered from time to time, they will be declared exchanged. This pro posal is made wi'h the understanding that the officers and (275)"], [290, "276 supplement. men on both sides who have been longest in captivity will be first delivered, where it is practicable.\" From a slight ambiguity in your phraseology, but more, perhaps, from the antecedent action of your authorities, and because of your acceptance of it, I am in doubt whether you have stated the proposition with entire accuracy. It is true, a proposition was made both by Major Mulford and by myself, as Agent of Exchange, to exchange all prisoners of war taken by either belligerent party, man for man, officer for officer, of equal rank, or their equivalents. It was made by me as early as the first of the winter of 1863-64, and has not been accepted. In May last I for warded to you a note, desiring to know whether the Con federate authorities intended to treat colored soldiers of the United States army as prisoners of war. To that inquiry no answer has yet been made. To avoid all possible mis apprehension or mistake hereafter as to your offer now, will you now say whether you mean by \" prisoners held in cap tivity,\" colored men, duly enrolled, and mustered into the service of the United States, who have been captured by the Confederate forces; and if your authorities are willing to exchange all soldiers so mustered into the United States army, whether colored or otherwise, and the officers com manding them, man for man, officer for officer ? At the interview which was held between yourself and the Agent of Exchange on the part of the United States, at Fortress Monroe, in March last, you will do me the favor to remember the principal discussion turned upon this very point; you, on behalf of the Confederate Government claiming the right to hold all negroes, who had heretofore been slaves, and not emancipated by their masters, enrolled and mustered into the service of the United States, when captured by your forces, not as prisoners of war, but upon capture to be turned over to their supposed masters or claimants, whoever they might be, to be held by them as slaves. By the advertisements in your newspapers, calling upon"], [291, "THE EXCHANGE QUESTION. 277 masters to come forward and claim these men so captured, I suppose that your autl orities still adhere to that claim \u2014 that is to say, that whenever a colored soldier of the United States is captured by you, upon whom any claim can be made by any person residing within the States now in insur rection, such soldier is not to be treated as a prisoner of war, but is to be turned over to his supposed owner or claimant, and put at such labor or service as that owner or claimant may choose, and the officers in command of such soldiers, in the language of a supposed act of the Confederate States, are to be turned over to the Governors of States, upon requisitions, for the purpose of being punished by the laws of such States, for acts done in war in the armies of the United States. You must be aware that there is still a proclamation by Jefferson Davis, claiming to be Chief Executive of the Confederate States, declaring in substance that all officers of colored troops mustered into the service of the United States were not to be treated as prisoners of war, but were to be turned over for punishment to the Governors of States. I am reciting these public acts from memory, and will be pardoned for not giving the exact words, although I believe I do not vary the substance and effect. These declarations on the part of those whom you repre sent yet remain unrepealed, unannulled, unrevoked, and must, therefore, be still supposed to be authoritative. By your acceptance of our proposition, is the Government of the United States to understand that these several claims, enactments, and proclaimed declarations are to be given up, set aside, revoked, and held for naught by the Confederate authorities, and that you are ready and willing to exchange man for man those colored soldiers of the United States, duly mustered and enrolled as such, who have heretofore been claimed as slaves by the Confederate States, as well as white soldiers? If this be so, and yc i are so willing to exchange these"], [292, "278 SUPPLEMENT. colored men claimed as slaves, and you will so officially inform the Government of the United States, then, as I am instructed, a principal difficulty in effecting exchanges will be removed. As I informed you personally, in my judgment, it is neither consistent with the policy, dignity, or honor of the United States, upon any consideration, to allow those who, by our laws solemnly enacted, are made soldiers of the Union, and who have been duly enlisted, enrolled and mus tered as such soldiers, who have borne arms in behalf of this country, and who have been captured while fighting in vin dication of the rights of that country, not to be treated as prisoners of war, and remain unexchanged, and in the service of those who claim them as masters ; and I cannot believe that the Government of the United States will ever be found to consent to so gross a wrong. Pardon me if I misunderstood you in supposing that your acceptance of our proposition does not in good faith mean to include all the soldiers of the Union, and that you still intend, if your acceptance is agreed to, to hold the colored soldiers of the Union unexchanged, and at labor or service, because I am informed that very lately, almost contempo raneously with this offer on your part to exchange prisoners and winch seems to include all prisoners of war, the Con federate authorities have made a declaration that the negroes heretofore held to service by owners in the States of Dela ware, Maryland, and Missouri are to be treated as prisoners of war, when captured in arms in the service of the United States. Such declaration that a part of the colored soldiers of the United States were to be prisoners of war, would seem most 6trongly to imply that others were not to be so treated, or in other words, that the colored men from the insurrec tionary States are to be held to labor and returned to their masters, if captured by the Confederate forces while duly enrolled and mustered into, and actually in the armies of the United States."], [293, "279 THE EXCHANGE QUESTION. In the view which the Government of the United States takes of the claim made by you to the persons and services of these negroes, it is not to be supported upon any prin ciple of national and municipal law. Looking upon these men only as property, upon your theory of property in them, we do not see how this claim can be made, certainly not how it can be yielded. It is believed to be a well-settled rule of public international law, and a custom and part of the laws of war, that the capture of movable property vests the title to that property in the captor, and therefore where one belligerent gets into full possession property belonging to the subjects or citizens of the other belligerent, the owner of that property is at once divested of his title, which rests in the belligerent Govern ment capturing and holding such possession. Upon this rule of international law all civilized nations have acted, and by it both belligerents have dealt with all property, save slaves, taken from each other during the present war. If the Confederate forces capture a number of horses from the United States, the animals immediately are claimed to be, and, as we understand it, become the property of the Confederate authorities. If the United States capture any movable property in the rebellion, by our regulations and laws, in conformity with international law, and the laws of war, such property is turned over to our Government as its property. Therefore, if we obtain possession of that species of property known to the laws of the insurrectionary States as slaves, why should there be any doubt that that property, like any other, vests in the United States ? If the property in the slave does so vest, then the \"jus disponendi,\" the right of disposing of that property, rests in the United States. Now, the United States have disposed of the property which they have acquired by capture in slaves taken by them, by giving that right of property to the man himself, to the slave, i. e. by emancipating him and declaring him"], [294, "280 SUPPLEMENT. free forever, so '.hat if we have not mistaken the principles of internatioi>?J law and the laws of war we have no slaves in the armies <<f the United States. All are free men, being made so in such manner as we have chosen to dispose of or.r property in them which we acquired by capture. Slaves befog captured by us, and the right of property in them thereby vested in us, that right of property has been disposed of by us by manumitting them, as has always been the acknowledged right of the owner to do to his slave. The manr.er in which we dispose of our property while it is in our po'jisssion certainly cannot be questioned by you. Nor }j the case altered if the property is not actually captured in battle, but comes either voluntarily or involun tarily from the belligerent owner into the possession of the other belligerent. I take it no one would doubt the right of the United States to a drove of Confederate mules, or a herd of Con federate cattle, which should wander or rush across the Con federate lines into the lines of the United States army. So it seems to me, treating the negro as property merely, if that piece of property passes the Confederate lines, and comes into the lines of the United States, that property is as much lost to its owner in the Confederate States as would be the mule or ox, the property of the resident of the Confederate States, which should fall into our hands. If, therefore, the privilege of international law and the laws of war used in this discussion are correctly stated, then it would seem that the deduction logically flows therefrom, in natural sequence, that the Confederate States can have no claim upon the negro soldiers captured by them from the armies of the United States, because of the former owner ship of them by their citizens or subjects, and only claim such as result, under the laws of war, from their captor raeiely. Do the Confederate authorities claim the right to reduce to a state of slavery free men, prisoners of war captured"], [295, "281 THE EXCHANGE QUESTION. by them? This claim our fathers fought against under Bainbridge and Decatur, when set up by the Barbary Powers on the northern shore of Africa, about the year 1800, and in 1864 their children will hardly yield it upon their own soil. This point I will not pursue further, because I understand you to repudiate the idea that you will reduce free men to slaves because cf capture in war, and that you base the claim of the Confederate authorities to re-enslave our negro soldiers, when captured by you, upon the \"jus post limini,\" or that principle of the law of nations which inhabilitates the former owner with his property taken by an enemy, when such property is recovered by the forces of his own country. Or in other words, you claim that, by the laws of nations and of war, when property of the subjects of one bellige rent power, captured by the forces of the other belligerent, is recaptured by the armies of the former owner, then such property is to be restored to its prior possessor, as if it had never been captured, and, therefore, under this principle your authorities propose to restore to their masters the slaves which heretofore belonged to them which you may capture from us. But this post liminary right under which you claim to act, as understood and defined by all writers on national law, is applicable simply to immovable property, and that too, only after the complete resubjugation of that portion of the country in which the property is situated, upon which this right fastens itself. By the laws and customs of war, this right has nevsr been applied to movable property. True, it is I believe, that the Romans attempted to apply it to the case of slaves, but for two thousand years no other nation has attempted to set up this right as ground for treating slaves differently from other property. But the Romans even refused to re-enslave men captured from opposing belligererts in a civil war, such as ours unhappily is."], [296, "282 SUPPLEMENT. Consistently then with any principle of the law of nati Jns, treating slaves as property merely, it would seem to be im possible for the Government of the United States to permit the negroes in their ranks to be re-enslaved when captured, or treated otherwise than as prisoners of war. I have forborne, sir, in this discussion, to argue the ques tion upon any other or different grounds of right than those adopted by your authorities in claiming the negro as pro perty, because I understand that your fabric of opposition to the Government of the United States has the right of property in man as its corner-stone. Of course it would not be profitable in settling a question of exchange of prisoners of war to attempt to argue the question of abandon ment of the very corner-stone of their attempted political edifice. Therefore I have admitted all the considerations which should apply to the negro soldier as a man, and dealt with him upon the Confederate theory of property only. I unite with you most cordially, sir, in desiring a speedy settlement of all these questions, in view of the great suffer ing endured by our prisoners in the hands of your authori ties, of which you so feelingly speak. Let me ask, in view of that suffering, why you have delayed eight months to answer a proposition which by now accepting you admit to be right, just, and humane, allowing that suffering to con tinue so long? One cannot help thinking, even at the risk of being deemed uncharitable, that the benevolent sympa thies of the Confederate authorities have been lately stirred by the depleted condition of their armies, and a desire to get into the field, to affect the present campaign, the hale, hearty, and well-fed prisoners held by the United States in exchange for the half-starved, sick, emaciated, and unser viceable soldiers of the United States now lan^uishine in your prisons. The events of this war, if we did not know it before, have taught us that it is not the Northern portion of the American people alone who know how to drive sharp bargains. The wrongs, indignities, and privations suffered by our"], [297, "THE EXCHANGE QUESTION. 283 soldiers would move me to consent to anything to procure their exchange, except to barter away the honor and faith of the Government of the United States, which has been so solemnly pledged to the colored soldiers in its ranks. Consistently with national faith and justice we cannot relinquish this position. With your authorities it is a ques tion of property merely. It seems to address itself to you in this form. Will you suffer your soldier, captured in fighting your battles, to be in confinement for months rather than release him by giving for him that which you call a piece of property, and which we are willing to accept as a man? You certainly appear to place less value upon your soldier than you do upon your negro. I assure you, much as we of the North are accused of loving property, our citizens would have no difficulty in yielding up any piece of property they have in exchange for one of their brothers or sons languishing in your prisons.
