They, too, seem to have given in to the curiosity attendant on the entrance of the new guests, and fix their large wide eyes on Vera, who in turn looks back on them with a certain interest. Lady Eiversdale by a word \u2014 an intensely proud, fond word \u2014 had intimated that they were her children, and Vera, filled with astonish ment at such information on comparing their beauty with the mother's remarkably homely face, had lost herself in a special glance around.

She feels a touch of regret as she loses her last glimpse of their deliciously solemn little countenances. Seaton is standing close beside her, as motionless as if on guard, and with an un conscious air of taking care of her that irritates her to the last degree.

Even here they hesitate, until the younger, taking her courage in both hands, slips her little slim fingers under the narrow gold bangles that adorn Vera's wrist, and begins to push them up and down with a childish diffident gesture.

As for Seaton, he too changes colour in a very tell-tale manner, and with a quick frown turns on his heel and walks abruptly away. ' Oh, I'm sorry I said that,' says the child, noting, with the unerring instinct of extreme youth, that luckless blush; ' I have vexed you.' ' Why should you think that ?

And now the society smile fades from Miss Butler's lips, she grows earnest, and presently he and she seem lost in a discussion as grave as it is earnest, and plainly of the utmost importance \u2014 at least to them.

No one could account for his presence in the old ruin ; no one, apparently, had ever heard of him before, save Grunch. That gaunt person had been appealed to, threatened, cajoled, all to no effect. The morning after the accident she had incidentally let out that his name Avas Sedley, and Peyton had at once pounced upon her. ' You kneAV him,' he said. ' Why did you not say so before ?

Light twigs, and some times heavy branches, are flung by the wind against the windows, and once as Vera stands motionlesss, silent, awed, it seems to her that there comes from far away, from out an immeasurable distance, a strange booming sound, that even to her uninitiated ears is horribly full of despair."], [256, "248 UNDER-CURRENTS Again, and once again, that melancholy sound has reached her ears.
