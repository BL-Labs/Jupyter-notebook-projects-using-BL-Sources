The following pages originally formed part of a much larger work, from the general course and design of which they constituted a digression. It seems therefore proper to preface them by a few words of explanation, relating chiefly to the work from which they are now separated. Mr. Van Buren, eighth President of the United States, on the expiration of his term of office, in the year 1841, retired to a country residence near Kinderhook, (the place of his birth,) in the State of New York, which he had then recently purchased, and to which he gave the name of Lindenwald. Here, with infrequent and brief inter ruptions, he continued to reside for some twenty years, or until his death, which occurred in July, 1862. Although numbering nearly sixty years of age, \u2014 two-thirds of which had been years of almost incessant activity and excitement, professional, political, and social, \u2014 at the period of his withdrawal to the tranquil scenes and occupations of rural life, he embraced the latter with an ardor and a relish that surprised not a little the friends who had known him only as prominent in, and apparently engrossed by, the public service, but which were happy results of early predilections, an even and cheerful temper, fitting him for"], [16, "INTEODUCTION. IV and constantly inclining him to the enjoyment of domestic intercourse, a hearty love of Nature, and a sound con stitution of mind and body. After twelve years of the period of his retirement had passed, happily and con tentedly, he began to apply a portion of his \" large leisure \" to a written review of his previous life, and to recording his recollections of his contemporaries and of his times. To this work, as he intimates in its opening paragraphs, he was mainly induced by the solicitations of life-long friends, who, (it may be here added,) knowing the im portance and interest of the scenes and incidents of his extended public career, and the extraordinary influence he had exerted upon public men and questions of his time, and perceiving the tenaciousness of his memory and the charm of his conversation unimpaired by the lapse of seventy years, confidently anticipated a work of much interest in such a record as they urged upon him to make. But although Mr. Van Buren so far complied with these suggestions as to set about writing his memoirs, he was not inclined to pursue the employment as a task, or to devote more of his time to it than could be easily spared from other occupations in which he was interested, and in order to keep himself from every temptation to exceed this limitation, he resolved, at the start, that no part of what he might write should be published in his lifetime. The work which he had commenced, was thus exposed to frequent interruption, even by unimportant accidents, and at length was altogether arrested by the serious illness of a member of his family, and by the failure of his own health, which rapidly supervened. It"], [17, "INTRODUCTION. V resulted that the recorded memoirs of his life and times closed abruptly when he had brought them down to the date of 1833-34, and that he never revised for pub lication what he had written. There is evidence that he contemplated such a revision when he should reach a convenient stage of his progress, but from the circum stances under which he wrote (which have been alluded to) as well as from his comparatively small interest in the mere graces of composition, the labov lim\u0153 was continually postponed, and the \" flighty purpose \" was never o'ertaken. When, after his death, the subject of the disposition of these memoirs was presented to his sons, to whom his papers had been intrusted, they were embarrassed by questions as to the manner and form in which it was their duty to give them the publicity intended by their author. Should they, notwithstanding unaffected distrust of their qualifications, and a deep sense of special unfitness arising from natural partiality, undertake to con tinue the history of their father's life from the point at which his own account had ceased, to supply, as far as they could, the gaps in the previous narrative which had been left by him for further examination or after-construc tion, and to give to the work the extensive revision which, in the state in which it came to their hands, it seemed to require ? Or should they publish the unfinished and unre vised memoirs, as they were left, as a fragment and a contribution, so far as they might go, to the history of the country \\ Would one or the other of these be such a history of the life of a statesman who had filled a large space in the observation of his countrymen, and who had"], [18, "INTRODUCTION. VI exerted a controlling influence in the Government during interesting and critical periods, as would answer a natural and just public expectation, or satisfy the many warm friends who survived him'? While occupied with the con sideration of these questions, they received a note from Charles H. Hunt, Esq., informing them that he felt strongly inclined to write a Biography of Mr. Van Buren, and requesting the use for that purpose of any materials within their power to furnish. An additional paragraph of Mr. Hunt's note, referring to the rumor of writings left by Mr. Van Buren, showed that he had been entirely misinformed as to the nature and extent of those writings ; he, in effect, supposing them to con sist solely of disquisitions on various political questions. The communication of Mr. Hunt not only superseded the necessity of deciding between the alternative proposi tions mentioned, but afforded them in all respects great satisfaction. His ripe and graceful scholarship, sound judgment, and pure taste were widely known, and espe cially to all who, like themselves, enjoyed familiar acquaint ance with him. He had, moreover, recently advanced by a single step to the first rank among American biographers \u2014 a position readily accorded by recognized authority in the republic of letters, at home and abroad, to the author of the \"Life of Edward Livingston.\" To such hands they could not hesitate to commit the work proposed, so far as they were able to control it, feeling assured that while Mr. Hunt would bring to its performance the dis interestedness and impartiality indispensable to give it value as a history, and which are with difficulty main-"], [19, "INTRODUCTION. VII tained in family memorials, his inclination to undertake it was evidence of a general sympathy with, or at least respect for, Mr. Van Buren's character and public career sufficient to authorize the relinquishment to him of the materials in their possession. Accordingly the frag mentary memoirs, with all the correspondence and other manuscripts applicable to his purpose, and within their reach, were committed to Mr. Hunt, by Mr. Van Buren's representatives, with entire satisfaction and confidence that they will be used with fidelity and skill in the construction of the work he has undertaken, \u2014 a confidence that will be shared by Mr. Van Buren's surviving friends and by the public. The main body of manuscripts left by Mr. Van Buren having been thus applied, some question remained in regard to that portion now published. Begun as an epi sode, the subject grew on the author's hands (as he ex plains in a note) to such proportions as to seem to stand more properly as a distinct production, and although, like the principal work, incomplete, it had been nevertheless carried forward to the point, chronologically speaking, that had been proposed, and that was in fact its natural termination. For this reason, and because it had no such connection with the memoirs as required that they should be printed together, it has been thought best to publish it without further delay in the form in which it was left by the writer. The subject is of peculiar in terest at this time when our country, having suffered the rude shock and disorder of civil war, and our free and popular institutions having sustained with admirable"], [20, "INTRODUCTION.

Mr. Jefferson commenced the discharge of his official duties by an act which, though one of form, involved matter of the highest moment. I allude to the decision and facility with which, in his intercourse with the other branches of the Government, he suppressed the ob servance of empty ceremonies which had been borrowed from foreign courts by officers who took an interest in such matters, and were reluctantly tolerated by Washing ton, who was himself above them. Instead of proceeding in state to the capitol to deliver a speech to the legislature, according to the custom of monarchs, he performed his constitutional duty by means of a message in writing, sent to each House by the hands of his private secretary, and they performed theirs by a reference of its contents to ap propriate committees. The Executive procession, instead of marking the intercourse between the different branches of the Government, was reserved for the Inauguration, when the President appeared before the people themselves, and in their presence took the oath of office. A step so appropriate and so much in harmony with our institutions, was naturally followed by efforts for the abo lition of offices and official establishments not necessary to the public service, the reduction of the public expenses, and the repeal of odious internal taxes. To these he added the influence of his individual example to keep the organization aud action of the Federal Government upon that simple and economical footing which is consistent with the Republican system. In this branch of his official conduct he established precedents of great value, from some of which his successors have not ventured to depart. With the single exception of his approval of the Bank"], [25, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 3 of the United States, the administration of Mr. Madison was one of great merit, and was made especially illustrious by conducting the country through a war imperishably honorable for its military achievements and the consequent elevation of our national character. Jefferson and Madison were brought forward by caucus nominations ; they, throughout, recognized and adhered to the political party that elected them ; and they left it united and powerful, when, at the close of public life. they carried into their retirement, and always enjoyed, the respect, esteem, and confidence of all their countrymen. Mr. Monroe's administration did not introduce any very disturbing public questions. The protective policy was, toward its close, generally acquiesced in at the North and West, and no part of the South as yet even contem plated the resistance which was subsequently attempted. The agitation in regard to internal improvements was yet for the most part speculative and too far in advance of any contemplated action to stir the public mind. The Bank of the United States was having its own way without ques tion on the part of the Government, and with but little if any suspicion on the part of the people. No very embar rassing questions had arisen in our foreign relations ; yet the first year of Mr. Monroe's second term had scarcely passed away before the political atmosphere became inflamed to an unprecedented extent. The Repub lican party, so long in the ascendant, and apparently so omnipotent, was literally shattered into fragments, and we had no fewer than five Republican Presidential candidates in the field. In the place of two great parties arrayed against each other in a fair and open contest for the establishment of principles in the administration of Government which they respectively believed most conducive to the public interest,"], [26, "4 POLITICAL PARTIES the country was overrun with personal factions. These having few higher motives for the selection of their candidates or stronger incentives to action than individual preferences or antipathies, moved the bitter waters of political agitation to their lowest depths. The occurrence of scenes discreditable to all had for a long time been prevented by a steady adherence on the part of the Republican party to the caucus system ; and if Mr. Monroe's views and feelings upon the subject had been the same as were those of Jefferson. and Madison, the results to which I have alluded, and which were soon sincerely deprecated, might have been prevented by the same means. There was no difference in the political con dition of the country between 1816 \u2014 when Mr. Monroe received a caucus nomination, on a close vote between Mr. Crawford and himself, and was elected \u2014 and 1824, when the caucus system was appealed to by the supporters of Mr. Crawford, which called for its abandonment. The Federal party were on both occasions incapable of success fully resisting a candidate in whose favor the Republicans were united, and they were on each sufficiently strong to control the election when the support of their opponents was divided amongst several. Mr. Monroe and a majority of his cabinet were unfortunately influenced by different views, and pursued a course well designed to weaken the influence of the caucus system, and to cause its abandon ment. Mr. Crawford was the only candidate who, it was believed, could be benefited by adhering to it, and the friends of all the others sustained the policy of the admin istration. Those of Jackson, Adams, Clay, and Calhoun, united in an address to the people condemning the practice of caucus nominations, and announcing their determination to disregard them. Already weakened through the adverse influence of the administration, the agency which had so"], [27, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 5 long preserved the unity of the Republican party did not retain sufficient strength to resist the combined assault that was made upon it, and was overthrown. Mr. Craw ford and his friends adhered to it to the last, and fell with it. It is a striking fact in our political history that the sagacious leaders of the Federal party, as well under that name as under others by which it has at different times been known, have always been desirous to bring every usage or plan designed to secure party unity into disrepute with the people, and in proportion to their success in that has been their success in the elections. When they have found such usage too strong- to be overthrown for the time being, they have adopted it themselves, but only to return to their denunciations of it after every defeat. It would, on first impression, seem that a practice which is good for one political party must be good for another ; but when the matter is more closely looked into, it will be discovered that the policy of the Federal leaders referred to, like most of the acts of those far-seeing men, rested upon substan tial foundations. It originated, beyond doubt, in the con viction, on the part of the early Federalists, that a political organization in support of the particular principles which they advocated, and to which they intended to adhere, did not stand as much in need of extraneous means to secure harmony in its ranks as did that of their opponents. The results of general elections for more than half a century have served to confirm this opinion. With the exception of a single instance, susceptible of easy explana tion, the Republican, now Democratic party, whenever it has been wise enough to employ the caucus or convention system, and to use in good faith the influence it is capable of imparting to the popular cause, has been successful, and it has been defeated whenever that system has been laid"], [28, "6 POLITICAL PARTIES aside or employed unfairly. With the Federal party and its successors the results have been widely different ; with or without the caucus system they have generally found no difficulty in uniting whenever union promised success. Why is it that a system or practice open to both parties, occasionally used by both, and apparently equally useful to both, is in fact so much less necessary to one than to the other I If this consequence springs from a corresponding difference in the principles for the defense and spread of which they have respectively been formed, what are those principles, whence are they derived, and what is their history \\ These are grave questions, which have often presented themselves to the minds of our public men, and to answer which satisfactorily is neither an easy nor a short task. Histories of struggles for power between individual men or families, long involved in obscurity, are becoming more frequent than they were, and far more satisfactory. Aided by a comparatively free access to public and private papers, \u2014 a privilege formerly sturdily refused, but which the liberal spirit of the age has now made common, \u2014 the literary men of most countries, with improved capacities to weigh con flicting statements as well as to narrate the results of their researches with simplicity and perspicuity, are probing the most hidden recesses of the past, and describing with reli able accuracy transactions of great interest, the causes and particular circumstances of which have been hitherto little or not at all understood. But to define the origin and trace the history of national parties is an undertaking of extraordinary difficulty ; one from which, in view of the embarrassments that surround it in the case of our own political divisions, I have more than once retired in de spair, and on which I now enter with only slight hopes of success. Yet it is due as well to the memories of the past"], [29, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 7 as to actual interests, that a subject which has exerted so great an influence and which may be made so instructive, should be made plain, if that be practicable, to the under standings of the present and succeeding generations ; and if my imperfect effort shall have a tendency to turn stronger minds and abler pens in that direction it will not have been made in vain. The two great parties of this country, with occasional changes in their names only, have, for the principal part of a century, occupied antagonistic positions upon all important political questions. They have maintained an unbroken succession, and have, throughout, been composed respectively of men agreeing in their party passions and preferences, and entertaining, with rare exceptions, similar general views on the subjects of government and its admin istration. Sons have generally followed in the footsteps of their fathers, and families originally differing have in regular succession received, maintained, and transmitted this opposition. Neither the influences of marriage connec tions, nor of sectarian prejudices, nor any of the strong motives which often determine the ordinary actions of men, have, with limited exceptions, been sufficient to override the bias of party organization and sympathy, devotion to which has, on both sides, as a rule, been a master -passion of their members. The names of these parties, like those of their prede cessors in older countries, have from time to time been changed, from suggestions of policy or from accidental causes. Men of similar and substantially unchanged views and principles have, at different periods of English history, been distinguished as Cavaliers or Roundheads, as Jaco bites or Puritans and Presbyterians, as Whigs or Tories. Here, with corresponding consistency in principle, the same men have at different periods been known as Federalists,"], [30, "8 POLITICAL PARTIES Federal Republicans, and Whigs, or as Anti- Federalists, Republicans, and Democrats. But no changes of name have indicated \u2014 certainly not until very recently, and the depth and duration of the exception remain to be seen \u2014 \u25a0 a change or material modification of the true character and principles of the parties themselves. The difference between the old Republican and the Anti-Federal parties, arising out of the questions in regard to the new Consti tution, was by far the greatest variation that has occurred. Several hasty and but slightly considered attempts have been made to define the origin, and to mark the progress, of our national parties. But, with a single exception, \u2014 namely, that made by ex-President John Quincy Adams, in his Jubilee Discourse before the New York Historical Society, on the 30th of April, 1839, being the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Inauguration of George Washington as President of the United States, \u2014 they have not pro fessed, so far as they have fallen under my notice, to do more than glance at the subject. To say that this discourse of one hundred and twenty pages was written with Mr. Adams's accustomed ability, would be a commendation short of its merits. It was more. The political condition of the country, and the near approach of the memorable struggle of 1840, superadded to the stirring considerations connected with the occasion, seem to have persuaded that distinguished man that he was called upon to make an extraordinary effort. A severe philippic against his and his father's political enemies, this discourse, judged in the sense in which such performances are naturally estimated by contemporaries imbued with similar feelings, could not fail to be regarded as an eloquent and able production ; but I deceive myself if it can be deemed by a single ingenuous mind either a dispassionate or an impartial review of the origin and"], [31, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 9 course of parties in the United States. Such minds will be more likely to receive a paper, written so long after the transactions of which it speaks, with feelings of regret at the strong evidence it affords that the rage of party spirit, upon the assumed extinguishment of which its author had, years before, exultingly congratulated the people from the Presidential chair, was yet so active in his own breast. I say this more in sorrow than in anger. Other portions of this work1 will, I am sure, exonerate me from the sus picion of cherishing the slightest sentiment of unkindness toward the memory of John Quincy Adams. When my personal acquaintance with him was but slight, and when our political relations were unfavorable to the cultivation of friendly feelings, my dispositions toward him were to an unusual extent free from the prejudices commonly engen dered by party differences. In the later periods of our acquaintance, continuing to the end of his life, I regarded him with entire personal respect and kindness ; and not withstanding the occasional fierceness of our political collisions, I have never heard of any unfriendly expression by him in respect to myself personally. It is not a little remarkable, though in harmony with other striking features in the relations of our parties, that no serious attempt has ever been made to trace their origin except by members of the same political school with Mr. Adams. If I am right in this, mine will at least have the weight, whatever that may be, due to the narration of one who, from the beginning to the end of an extended politi cal career, has been an invariable and ardent member of the opposite school.

President John Quincy Adams, in his Inaugural Address, attributes them to the conflicting prejudices and preferences of the people for and against Great Britain and France at the commence ment of the present government, and the discontinuance of them to the effects produced by the excesses of the French Revolution. Matthew L. Davis, \u2014 a man of much note and cleverness, who commenced his career an active member of the old Republican party, became the especial champion of Colonel Burr, and, soon seceding from the party to which he was at first attached, spent the remainder of his life in opposition to it, \u2014 in his life of Aaron Burr, attrib utes the origin of our two great political parties to the proceedings of the Federal Constitutional Convention and of the State Conventions which passed upon the question of ratification. These various versions of the matter I shall hereafter notice, contenting myself, for the present, with the remark that party divisions which have extended to every corner of a country as large as our own, and have endured so long, could not spring from slight or even limited causes. No differences in the views of men on isolated questions tem porary in their nature, could, it seems to me, have pro duced such results. Questions of such a character are either finally settled, with more or less satisfaction, or in time lose their interest, notwithstanding momentary excite ment, and the temporary organizations springing from them give place in turn to others equally short-lived. But when men are brought under one government who differ radically in opinion as to its proper form, as to the uses for which governments should be established, as to the spirit iu which they should be administered, as to the best"], [33, "IN* THE UNITED STATES. 11 way in which the happiness of those who are subject to them can be promoted, no less than in regard to the capac ity of the people for self-government, we may well look for party divisions and political organizations of a deeper foun dation and a more enduring existence. Ours arose at the close of the Revolution, and the leading parties to them were the Whigs, through whose instrumentality, under favor of Providence, our Independ ence had been established. They and the Tories consti tuted our entire population, and the latter had at first, for obvious reasons, but little to do in the formation of parties, save to throw themselves in a body into the ranks of one of them. It became at once evident that great differences of opinion existed among the Whigs in respect to the character of the government that should be substituted for that which had been overthrown, and also in respect to the spirit and principles which should control the administra tion of that which might be established. These spread through the country with great rapidity, and were respect ively maintained with a zeal and determination which proved that they were not produced by the feelings or impulses of the moment. To ascertain the origin of those differences, and to trace their effects, we can adopt no safer course than to look to the antecedents of the actors in the stirring political scenes that followed the close of the war, to the characters and opinions of their aucestors, from whom they had naturally imbibed their first ideas of gov ernment either directly or traditionally, and to the inci dents of the memorable struggle from which the country had just emerged. The great principle first formally avowed by Rousseau, \" that the right to exercise sovereignty belongs inalienably to the people,\" sprung up spontaneously in the hearts of the colonists, aud silently influenced all their acts from the"], [34, "12 POLITICAL PARTIES beginning. The condition of the country in which they settled, \u2014 a wilderness occupied besides themselves only by savage tribes, \u2014 to which many of them were driven by the fiercest persecutions ever known to the civilized world, and the stern self-reliance and independent spirit which most of them had acquired in contests with iron fortune that preceded their exile, combined to induce the cultivation and to secure the permanent growth of such a sentiment. Not being, however, for several generations, iu a suitable condition, and from counteracting inducements not even disposed to dispute the pretensions of the Crown to their allegiance, they were content to look principally to its patents and other concessions for the measure of their rights. But their views were greatly changed, and their advance on the road to freedom materially accelerated, by the English Revolution of 1688. The final overthrow of James II., from whose tyrannical acts, as well in the char acter of Duke of York as in that of King, they had severely suffered, was not the greatest advantage the colo nists derived from that Revolution. The principles upon which that most important of European movements was founded, and the doctrines it consecrated, paved the way to a result which, though not upon their tongues, or perhaps to any great extent the subject of their meditations as immediately practicable, was, doubtless, from that time, within their contemplation. That Revolution, which shattered, \"past all surgery,\" the blasphemous and absurd dogma of the divine right of kings; which replaced the slavish doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance with the principle that the authority of the monarch was no other than a trust founded on an assumed agreement between him and his subjects that the power conferred upon him should be used for their advantage, for the faithful execution of which he"], [35, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 13 was individually responsible, and for a breach of which resistance to his authority, as a last resort, was a consti tutional remedy ; which for the supremacy of the Crown substituted the supremacy of Parliament; which made the King as well as his subjects responsible to its authority, and which abrogated the right of the Crown to govern the colonies in virtue of its prerogative, and vested that power in Parliament, placed the colonists upon a footing widely different from that they had theretofore occupied. The general principle that they were, by the laws and statutes of England, entitled to the political rights that appertained to British subjects, could not be denied, but commercial rivalry and political jealousies acting upon their excited feelings, soon generated questions of the gravest import, both as to the extent of the power of Parlia ment to legislate for them, and as to the participation in representation essential to authorize the exercise of that power. The subjects of taxation and the regulation of trade by Parliamentary authority, excited the greatest interest on both sides of the Atlantic. In respect to the latter, the question was not a little embarrassed by an alleged acqui escence on the part of the colonists, and the consequent force of precedents. This circumstance, in connection with the consideration that, if the right to regulate the trade of the colonies was denied to the mother country, the allegiance conceded to be due would be paid to a barren sceptre, was calculated to deprive the cause of the colonists of the favorable opinion of those just men in England whose countenance and support were of so much service to them in the sequel. Duly appreciating the obstacles to success which there was reason to apprehend from this source, with the prudence and good sense that belonged to their character, and without waiving any of their rights,"], [36, "14 POLITICAL PARTIES they placed their cause principally upon a ground that lay at the foundation of the Revolution, and was thoroughly immovable, viz., that by the fundamental laws of property no taxes could be levied upon the people but by their own consent or that of their authorized agents, and that by consequence the connection was indissoluble between taxa tion and representation. In the justice and constitutionality of this position they were openly sustained by Lord Chatham, Lord Camden, Burke, Fox, and others, \u2014 men who were in their day and have since been regarded as leading minds of England. With but little of public sentiment against them beyond what was influenced by the inveterate hatred and the in sane obstinacy of the King, wielding at will the majority of a notoriously corrupt Parliament and the brute force of the kingdom, the colonists appealed to the God of Battles in defense of a sacred principle of freedom, and in resistance to tyrannical acts of the most odious and oppressive char acter, and they were victorious. It is now, and will be in all time, a source of satisfaction to the people of these States, that the decision of the sword is not their only uor their highest title to the liberty they enjoy. The colonists were right in the contest. Of this no serious doubt is now entertained in any honest and well-informed quarter. The idea of virtual representation, and the attempt to jus tify one wrong by the practice of another, namely, the tax ing other British subjects without giving them an adequate representation in Parliament, \u2014 the only replies that were made to the claim of constitutional rights, \u2014 are now well understood, and, it gives me pleasure to say, generally dis avowed in England. Lord Derby, the manly and highly gifted leader of what is left of the old Tory party, not long since, in a speech delivered in the presence of an American minister, unreservedly admitted that we were"], [37, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 15 right in the Revolutionary contest ; and, if that question were now submitted to the free judgment of the people of England, such would be found to be the public sense of that great nation. The only way in which the right in respect to taxation set up by the English Parliament could have been sus tained consistently with the English Constitution, would have been by a joint government, securing to the colonies the representation in that body to which they were entitled as British subjects, \u2014 a plan to which both the mother country and the colonies were equally decided in their dislike, but for very different reasons. If a similar ques tion were presented at this day it would, according to the present state of public opinion in both countries, be at once settled by an alliance of peace and friendship, sub stituting fraternal relations for chose of parent and chil dren. Well would it have been for the interests of both and of humanity if the matter had been thus adjusted. The immediate question upon which the Revolution turned was, of course, forever extinguished by its results. But it has been far otherwise with the opinions, doubtless of various shades and equally sincere, in regard to the nature of government, the uses to which it could be prop erly applied, and the manner and spirit of its application, with which the colonists entered into the contest, and with the feelings engendered by those opinions and developed by the war. Upon these points the characters and successive conditions of the early emigrants exerted a great influence. Those to Virginia were first in point of time, and certainly not inferior to any in the elements of character adapted to the difficulties they were destined to encounter. History, doubtless authentic, records that the first emigration to that State was a measure of the patriotic party in England,"], [38, "16 POLITICAL PARTIES and sprung from a desire to make an offering to liberty in the wilderness which the stringency of power had pre vented them from making at home. The accomplishment of that design, whatever may have been the aid subse quently derived from its authors, has been eminently suc cessful. Whether as colonists, as citizens of a free State, or as a part of our great Confederacy, the emigrants to Virginia, their successors and descendants, have done all that men could do to realize the anticipations and designs of the founders of that ancient colony. Fully equal to them in devotion to liberty, with the additional merit of having made greater sacrifices in its defense, stood the Puritans, whose descendants are said to constitute at this time one fifth (I believe it is) of the people of the United States. It would be superfluous to describe either the persecutions to which they were subjected by arbitrary power or their fidelity to their principles. Their story is known, and their early character understood, throughout the civilized world. The Huguenots entered largely into the early settlement of several of the colonies, and their descendants now con stitute numerous portions of several of our States. Indeed, the very first European colony established in this country was composed of Huguenots, who were exterminated by the Spaniards, \u2014 an event which, indirectly, contributed greatly to the e'nigration to Virginia under Sir Walter Raleigh. Fugitives from the most cruel as well as the most obstinate persecutions, hunted like wild beasts on account of their devotion to religious freedom and the right of opinion, they fled to our shores, detesting irre sponsible power of every description, and ready to do their utmost to prevent its re-incorporation in our virgin system. The States- General and the Dutch West India Com-"], [39, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 17 pany, although the former were perhaps not more favor able to popular sovereignty, in our sense of these words, than the Stuarts, and the latter altogether mercenary, yet introduced into this country, in the colonization of New Netherlands, emigrants especially adapted, by character and disposition, to the scenes through which they were destined to pass. This happy result was attributable to the peculiar conjuncture of affairs at home when the establishment of that colony was undertaken. It was during the continu ance of the truce in their War of Independence \u2014 the first that was granted to them by Philip II., after that bar barous contest had already lasted forty years \u2014 that the attention of the United Provinces was directed to this country. The revolting cruelties which Philip had caused to be inflicted upon the Dutch, through the instrumentality of Alva, are as notorious to the world as are those to which the Huguenots were subjected by Charles IX. and Louis XIV. ; and the spirit of resistance to arbitrary power, whether ecclesiastical or political, was branded as by fire upon the hearts of both. To colonists of these descriptions were from time to time added nurAerous other Protestants, who had fled to Holland, as well after the massacre of St. Bartholomew as from other and kindred demonstrations of political and priestly des potism in various parts of Europe, with an infusion of descendants of the disciples of the Bohemian martyr, John Huss, who, from the stake to which he had been doomed for his resistance to papal tyranny, conjured his followers not to put their trust in princes. The mass of the early colonists having been sufferers at home, as well from social and political inequalities as from the heavy hand of power applied to themselves, having left behind them much that they dreaded and nothing that they approved in the management of public affairs, were ex- 2"], [40, "18 POLITICAL PARTIES posed to no influences that could disincline them to the establishment of just and equal governments in the land of their adoption. Nothing could therefore be more natural than that they and their immediate descendants, made familiar with the wrongs and outrages practiced ou their fathers by absolute tyrants, should have been jealous of their liberties, and disposed to be rigid in their restrictions upon the grant and exercise of delegated authority. From this disposition sprang the principles to which they always adhered in the administration of public affairs, and in the defense of which they appear to have been always ready to make any necessary sacrifice. These, on the part of by far the largest portions of the original colonists and their de scendants, were an insurmountable opposition to hereditary political power in any shape and under any circumstances ; a suspicious watchfulness of all official authority, propor tioned to their knowledge of its liability to be abused ; a consequent indisposition to concede more than was indis pensable to good government ; the establishment of a certain, and, as they called it, a swift responsibility for the exercise of that which was granted ; an habitual distrust, exhibited on various occasions in their history, of every offer of special privileges by government, and an unwill ingness to confer the power to grant them, \u2014 the former springing from suspicion that they were designed to impair their independence, and the latter from conviction, fully justified by experience, that such a power will always end in favoritism; and an early and strong appreciation of the value of union among themselves and between the colonies, originating in the necessity for their protection against the savages, and kept alive by perpetual machina tions from the mother country to weaken and restrict their freedom. These and kindred feelings and principles were, as I"], [41, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 19 have said, natural to men whose antecedents, as well as those of their ancestors, had been such as I have described ; and they remained throughout the prevailing features of colonial politics. They were not only the views of men prominent in their respective communities, but the matured convictions of the masses in respect to the line of policy necessary to their welfare, and therefore the more likely to be perpetuated, for it has been well and truly said, that \" it is the masses alone that live.\" These opinions might occa sionally and for a season lie dormant, or be made to yield to power, but neither corruption nor force could eradicate them. With occasional but brief intermissions, they con trolled the action of the colonial legislatures ; were em braced by a majority of the signers of the Declaration of In dependence ; directed the course of the Revolutionary Con gress as well as that of the Government of the Confedera tion subsequent to the recognition of our Independence, and were in truth always the real sentiments of a majority of the people. It will be hereafter seen when they were for a season rendered powerless, and when and how their control over the action of the government was restored. The materials for tracing the action of the public mind, and the proceedings of public bodies during the early periods of our history, are, in comparison with those appli cable to modern times, quite imperfect. But aided by the facts which the historians of our day, with great industry and in most cases with equal fidelity, have drawn from oblivion, and still more by the recent very general publica tion of the papers of eminent deceased statesmen, the work has become less difficult. The fidelity of the Puritans to their well-known prin ciples in respect to hereditary power, was soon exposed to a severe trial. During the residence of Sir Henry Vane"], [42, "20 POLITICAL PARTIES in the Colony of Massachusetts, several English peers, in duced by a desire to remove to that colony and to make it their place of permanent residence, offered to do so if changes could be effected in its government, by which the General Court should be divided into two bodies, and their hereditary right to seats in the upper branch allowed to them. Strong as was the wish of the colonists for the acquisition of those distinguished men, they yet declined a compliance with their wishes. All that they could be in duced to allow was a life-tenure, and they actually made some appointments of that character ; but of this they soon repented, and attached to the offices held by that tenure a condition which made the concession nugatory by making it valueless. It is perhaps not assuming too much to sup pose that the regret they experienced at this momentary forgetfulness of their principles \u2014 a regret exhibited in various ways \u2014 had no small influence in inducing them to limit the terms of offices in the New England States to very short periods, as is still the custom there. Similar conduct and feeling were disclosed by the colo nists on every occasion that presented itself for their dis play, but the necessity for their exhibition was in a great measure superseded by the Declaration of Independence and the war that succeeded, during the continuance of which sentiments favorable to hereditary power were re garded by the country as crimes to be punished. Our Independence was scarcely established when a cir cumstance occurred which exhibited in a very striking manner the fixed aversion of the great body of the people to hereditary distinctions. The officers of the army, desirous of perpetuating the memory of the relations of respect and friendship which had grown up among them during the trying and momen tous scenes through which they had passed, established, in '"], [43, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 21 May, 1783, the \" Society of the Cincinnati,\" and made the honor of membership hereditary. It has not appeared that General Washington was consulted upon the subject in the first instance, but conscious of the purity of his own motives, and confiding fully in those of his military asso ciates, he allowed his name to be placed at the head of the list of members and consented to be its president. The principle of hereditary distinctions could not well have been placed before the people in a less exceptionable form, and yet there were but few occurrences during the war by which the public mind was so deeply excited as that by which the officers intended to grace the closing scenes of their meritorious career. The measure was as sailed in all the forms in which an offended public opinion usually finds vent. In addition to able and eloquent attacks from American pens, the movement was severely criticised in a pamphlet published in France and written by Mira beau, entitled, \" Thoughts on the Order of Cincinnatus.\" General Washington informed himself of the extent to which the subject was agitating the public mind, and, justly alarmed at the consequences it might produce, de termined to do all in his power to arrest its progress. He wrote to Mr. Jefferson in April, 1784, asking his opinion and the probable views of Congress (of which Mr. Jeffer son was a member) upon the subject, and his advice in re spect to the most eligible measures to be adopted by the society at their next meeting, which was to be held in the ensuing month of May. This letter does not appear in the published writings of AVashington, but an extract from it is given by Mr. Sparks, from which and from Jefferson's reply its contents as stated are gathered. Mr. Jefferson's answer, containing an unreserved communication of his opin ions in the matter, may be found in Vol. I. of his Correspond ence. He stated at length the objections that were made"], [44, "22 POLITICAL PARTIES to the society, the unfriendliness of Congress to it, and added, in conclusion, that if, rather than decide themselves upon the best course to be pursued, the members should, at their approaching meeting, refer the question to Congress, such a reference would \" infallibly produce a recommendation of total discontinuance.\" General Washington attended the meeting in May, and proposed several changes in the constitution, and among them, in his own words, taken by Mr. Sparks from memo randa in his own handwriting, \" to discontinue the hered itary part in all its connections, absolutely, without any substitution which can be construed into concealment or a change of ground only, for this would, in my opinion, in crease rather than allay suspicion.\" This amendment, and others having a similar bearing, were adopted. In Mr. Jefferson's letter to myself, accompanying this volume,1 to which, as it was prepared with great care, and avowedly designed \" to throw light on history and to recall that into the path of truth,\" I shall have frequent occasion to refer, will be found a highly interesting account of what took place between himself and General Washington, on his way to the meeting in Philadelphia, and on his return, in May, 1784. Some of the State societies rejected these modifications in toto, and others only agreed to them partially. The agitation of the subject was thus continued for several years, and as late as 1787 no State had yet so far yielded its prejudices as to grant the charter for which the consti tution of the society made it the duty of the State meet ings to apply. Whatever opinion may at this day be formed in regard to the sufficiency of the reasons for the alarm which this transaction produced, it cannot be doubted that the proceedings in regard to it afford strong proof that there 1 See Appendix."], [45, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 23 was, down to the spring of 1787, a settled aversion in the minds of a majority of ,the people to any measure or course of measures which were indicative of the slightest desire to return in any degree to the system which they had overthrown ; and that as early as 1783 strong suspicion existed that such desires were concealed in the minds of many who had previously stood faithfully by the country in all its perils. The intense hostility of the colonists and their successors to monarchical institutions, and the recollection of the cruel ties inflicted upon them and upon their predecessors under the authority of kings, had produced a determined repugnance on their part to the concentration of power in the hands of single magistrates. Their minds had become thoroughly impressed with a conviction that the disposition to abuse power by those who were intrustetl with it was not only inherent and invariable, but incurable, and that it was therefore unwise to grant more than was actually indispen sable to the management of public affairs. At no period anterior to the adoption of the present Constitution, could a majority be obtained in Congress for the creation of an executive branch of the Government, or an impression be made upon the public mind favorable to such a measure. The inconveniences experienced from a want of it during a protracted war, and which were again encountered in the public service after the recognition of our Independence, were not sufficient to overcome this repugnance. The tenacity with which they adhered to an equal representation and influence for the colonies before, and for the States after, the Declaration of Independence, in the confederacies and governments they formed, sprang from like considera tions. They could not be brought to believe that a State, to which was allowed a greater power than was reserved to its confederates, could be restrained from the ultimate"], [46, "24 POLITICAL PARTIES exercise of her superior power to depress her smaller con federates and to elevate herself. \u00ab Proofs of the existence and force of these opinions are spread through every portion of our early history. In 1643 the New England Colonies, with the exception of those \" who ran a different course \" from the Puritans, entered into a Confederacy. Its avowed design was the better advancement of their general interests, but its real object was to provide greater security against the savages by whom they were menaced. It was called the \" United Colonies of New England.\" The plan was for a season defeated, because Massachusetts claimed more power than she was willing to concede to the other colonies ; but it was finally established upon principles of perfect equality, no more power or influence being conceded to Massachusetts, by far the largest, than to New Haven, the smallest colony. The management of affairs was intrusted to commis sioners, of which each colony had two, but no executive power was conferred upon them. They might deliberate and recommend, but the colonies alone could carry their recommendations into effect. This Confederacy endured for nearly half a century, and worked well. In 1755 a convention of delegates from the colonies was held at Albany, under the stimulus of French encroach ments, and a plan of union, drawn up by Dr. Franklin, was agreed upon and submitted to the colonies for their approval. The plan, as was to be expected from the char acter of its author, distributed the powers of the govern ment between the people and the prerogatives of the Crown, much more favorably to the popular side than it would seem the latter might, in the then condition of things, have reasonably hoped for. Still the attachments of the colonists to their local governments, and, above all, their distrust and dread of a central government, which was pro-"], [47, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 25 vided for, were sufficient to deprive the plan of their favor, and to cause its ultimate abandonment. The privilege of \" Government within themselves,\" as \" their undoubted right in the sight of God and man,\" and \" to be governed by rulers of their own choosing and laws of their own making,\" were from the beginning objects of absorbing solicitude with the colonists and their Revolu tionary successors. The principles and sentiments I have attempted to de fine, which had sprung up at the earliest period in the colonies, and had grown with their growth and strengthened with their strength, and in explanation of which I have referred to a few of the many illustrations with which their history abounds, were doubtless those also of a great majority of the Whigs of the Revolution, in whose breasts was not wanting the feeling which rarely fails to be seen in those political divisions that lead to civil war, \u2014 a thorough an tagonism to the general opinions, as well as to the particu lar policy of the power or party opposed ; but it is equally true that those were far from being the principles or feelings of all by whose efforts the Revolution was achieved. A numerous portion of the Whigs of the Revolution, many of them greatly distinguished for their talents, high characters, and great public services, neither concurred in the principles nor sympathized with the feelings I have described, but were in a great measure driven by other considerations to take active parts in the struggle. The number thus in fluenced was, fortunately for the result of the contest, in creased by specific tyrannical acts, which a prudent govern ment would have avoided, but which were forced on the ministry and Parliament of the mother country by the ob stinacy and bigotry of the king. Within a year after his accession to the throne he wound up a series of unneces sary interferences with the administration of justice in the"], [48, "26 POLITICAL PARTIES colonies, by changing the tenure of office, which had till that period prevailed in relation to the colonial judges, from that of good behavior to that of the will and pleasure of the Crown. By thus using his prerogative to create a distinction in different parts of the realm degrading to the colonies, he left the colonial lawyers no other course consist ent with self-respect, to say nothing of patriotism, than to unite with those engaged in other pursuits in an effort to overthrow a government capable of such practices. While subjecting the legal profession to such humiliating proofs of the royal displeasure, his government commenced its assaults upon that portion of his subjects engaged in com merce. His indignation against those who scouted the doctrine of the British Constitution, \" that the king can do no wrong,\" was intense and unappeasable in proportion to their presumed intelligence. It was in this spirit that he appears to have selected judges, professional men, and mer chants, as special objects of his wrath, and having exerted his power against the first two classes, he turned his atten tion\" toward the latter. The Navigation Acts, as they stood at the period of his accession, had been framed in the illiberal and selfish spirit which characterized the legislation of the age. But though they had proved injurious to the trade of the colonies, and humiliating to the colonial merchants, in consequence of the extent to which they made their interests subservient to those of the mother country, yet their prejudicial effects had in neither respect been fully developed, in consequence of the remissness which had prevailed in their execution. This had in a great degree been occasioned by illicit con trivances between the colonists engaged in trade and navi gation and the officers of government stationed in the colonies. A vigorous execution of the existing laws not only was determined upon, but new acts were passed"], [49, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 27 imposing additional restrictions, and superadding cumula tive penalties upon those who disregarded them. To en force this vindictive policy the Government resorted to a measure at once the most arbitrary and odious of any that had ever been known to the public service, \u2014 that of \" Writs of Assistance,\" \u2014 and converted the army and navy into a police establishment to aid in the detection and punishment of the colonial offenders. By thus giving vent to his persecuting spirit \u2014 a spirit always blind to its own interests \u2014 this infatuated Prince drove into the front rank of the Revolution two classes of the colonists who were, from the nature of their pursuits, least likely to embark in popular outbreaks, and most in clined to favor a strong government, \u2014 classes which are usually caressed by more sagacious rulers, and which had been so here before the reign of George III. All orders of the colonists, save a few favorites, were by these and similar means united, as a band of brothers, in a move ment such as the world had never before, and has never since seen, for the overthrow of a government by which they were so sorely oppressed. This union was in other respects composed of very discordant materials. It consisted, on the one hand, of men and the descendants of men on whose hearts the fires of persecution had burned a hatred of royalty too deep to be erased and too zealous to be trifled with ; of men who were at the same time too conversant with human nature to allow themselves to believe that the love of power and the proneness to its abuse were con fined to its hereditary possessors, and who were there fore anxious to restrict grants of authority to their public functionaries to the lowest point consistent with good government, and to subject what they did grant to the most stringent responsibilities. They continued, also,"], [50, "28 POLITICAL PARTIES to cherish the same preference for their local organizations, and to entertain the same distrust of an overshadowing central government, for which the great body of the people had long been distinguished. They were men whose highest ambition and desire for themselves and the country was that it should have a plain, simple, and cheap government for the management of the affairs of the Confederacy, republican in its construction and democratic in its spirit, \u2014 a government that should, as far as prac ticable, be deprived of the power of creating artificial dis tinctions in society, and of corrupting and thus subverting the independence of the people by the possession of a re dundant patronage. Such a government had long been the subject of their meditations, and they braved the hazards and encountered the hardships of the Revolution ary contest for the opportunity of establishing it. The Revolutionary brotherhood by which the recognition of our Independence was enforced, contained, on the other hand, men respectable in numbers, and distinguished by talent, public service, and high social position, who dis sented from many (I may say from most) of these views, and who regarded them as Utopian in themselves, or as too contracted for the exigencies of the public service. This difference in the opinions of men who had been engaged in such a contest was all but unavoidable, and was never absent from any political struggle of sufficient im portance to be compared with it. It results, besides those which have been indicated as peculiar to our own condition and history, from simple but potent causes of universal operation, such as diversities in social condition, in educa tion, in the influence and tendencies of previous pursuits, and in individual character and temperament, producing diversities of views on such occasions. Although an aversion to royalty and opposition to"], [51, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 29 hereditary government in any form, were sentiments that pervaded the masses and exercised a controlling influence in the Revolution, there were not a few, of the character I have described, who, though they doubtless did not. at the moment design the reintegration of those institutions after the overthrow of the actual Government, could yet con template, without great revulsion of feeling, their ultimate establishment in this country. Prompt to resist tyranny in any shape, and stung by the oppressions practiced upon the colonies by the British Government, they hesitated not to peril their lives for its subversion here, whilst theoreti cally they not only tolerated its form and constitution, but regarded them as the best that could be devised to promote the welfare and to secure the happiness of mankind. Of the existence of this opinion on the part of many sincere friends and able advocates of the Revolutionary cause, in every stage of the contest and for years after its close, we have indubitable evidence. I will notice a few cases of this description, on account of the influence exerted on the formation of political parties by the knowledge of the ex istence of such opinions, and by the suspicions, perhaps unjust, and in some respects certainly so, as to the extent to which those who held them were willing to carry them out. In so doing, it is by no means my design to cast reproach upon the memories of the great men who enter tained them, and who stood by their country in her sever est extremity, and established the highest claims to her gratitude and favor. No ingenuous mind can doubt that a large majority of the Whigs were opposed to the substitution of a govern ment similar either in form or spirit to that from which they had emancipated themselves. Our Revolutionary creed was, \" That all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights;"], [52, "30 POLITICAL PARTIES that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap piness ; that to secure these rights, governments are insti tuted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ; that whenever any form of gov ernment becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter and abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundations on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\" Under such a creed all were entitled as of right to a perfect freedom of choice in regard to the character of the new government. Neither for the formation of their opin- ions, however erroneous these may have been, nor for the maintenance of them by lawful means, did any subject them- selves to just reproach, or to other forfeiture than perhaps i a loss of the confidence of those who thought differently. James Otis, Stephen Hopkins, John Adams, Gouver- neur Morris, and Alexander Hamilton, may be selected from many others as representatives of the principles of that class to which I have referred as dissenting from the popular or preponderating ideas of the time. I select them the more readily from a desire to avoid mistakes, as they were possessed of temperaments too sanguine and too fearless to be deterred from advancing openly opinions they honestly entertained, by their unpop- ularity. There were certainly not many individuals, if there was one, who did more to set the ball of the Revolution in motion than James Otis ; and if his career had not been cut short by the hand of violence he would have taken high rank among the great and good men who survived the struggle. His speech against the issuing of the Writs of Assistance had an effect corresponding to those of Patrick Henry. Yet this highly gifted man, whose patri-"], [53, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 31 otic spirit was sufficiently aroused by the oppressions of the mother country, while yet in their incipiency, to induce him to peril his life in acts of resistance, was an enthu siastic admirer of the principles of the English system, and honestly believed, as he said, \" that the British Consti tution came nearest the idea of perfection of any that had been reduced to practice.\" The patriotic Hopkins, one of the Rhode Island Repre sentatives in the General Congress, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, wrote \u2014 and that colony authoritatively published its concurrence in the declaration \u2014 that \"The glorious Constitution of Great Britain is the best that ever existed among men.\" Gouverneur Morris's unyielding hostility to democratic principles, and his preference for aristocratic and monarch ical institutions, were often exhibited and unreservedly avowed, as well on the floor of the Federal Convention as elsewhere, and have become familiar among his country men as household words. There were not many, if indeed there was a single one of his contemporaries, who went beyond him in hostility to the State governments. \"State attachments and State importance,\" said he in the Federal Convention, \" have been the bane of this country ! We cannot annihilate them, but we may, perhaps, take out the teeth of the serpents.\" Such as were his principles at the commencement of his career they remained to the close of his life. But the opinions of John Adams and Alexander Ham ilton, from their larger agency in the politics of the country, in the administration of its government, and in the actual formation of parties, are of still greater impor tance. A full exposition of these, beyond the single point upon which there existed the greatest jealousy at the period at which we have now arrived, \u2014 that of their preference"], [54, "32 POLITICAL PARTIES for the English system, \u2014 will be best postponed until we come to consider the times and occasions which were pre- sented for an ampler display of them. I will, therefore, only refer at this place to the contents of a statement prepared and signed by Thomas Jefferson, in February, 1818, and designed to explain a portion of his writings. In this he says, among other things : \" But Hamilton was not only a monarchist, but for a monarchy bottomed on corruption. In proof of this I will relate an anecdote for the truth of which I attest the God who made me. Before the Presi- dent set out upon his Southern tour, in April, 1791, he addressed a letter of the 4th of that month, from Mount Vernon, to the Secretaries of State, Treasury, and War, desiring that if any serious and important cases should arise during his absence they would consult and act on them, and he requested that the Vice-President should also be consulted. This was the only occasion on which that officer was ever requested to take part in a Cabinet ques- tion. Some occasion for consultation arising, I invited those gentlemen (and the Attorney-General, as well as I remember) to dine with me, in order to confer on the subject. After the cloth was removed, and our question argued and dismissed, conversation began on other matters, and by some circumstance was led to the British Constitu- tion, on which Mr. Adams observed, \u2014 ' Purge that Con- stitution of its corruption and give to its popular branch equality of representation, and it would become the most perfect Constitution ever devised by the wit of man.' Hamilton paused and said, \u2014 ' Purge it of its corruptions and give to its popular branch equality of representation and it would become an impracticable government : as it stands at present, with all its supposed defects, it is the most perfect which ever existed.' \" The solemn responsibility under which this statement"], [55, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 33 was made, the high character of its author, the time when it was recorded, \u2014 after one of the principal parties had passed from earth, and the two remaining were on the brink of the grave ; when the passions excited by personal and political rivalry had died away, and friendly relations had been restored between the survivors, \u2014 would of them selves be sufficient to establish its accuracy, even if its de scription of the opinions of Adams and Hamilton had not been, as it will be seen that they were, abundantly con firmed as well by the speeches and writings of the parties themselves as by the recorded declarations of associates and friends who possessed the best opportunities to become acquainted with their real sentiments. The natural presumption is \u2014 and there are many facts to prove its correctness \u2014 that opinions with which these most prominent leaders were so deeply imbued, had, to a very considerable extent at least, been diffused throughout the ranks of their followers. The effects of this discordance on so many and such vital points in the political doctrines and feelings of those by whom the Revolution had been achieved, were post poned by the existence of the war ; but when that restraint was removed by the recognition of our Independence they broke forth unavoidably, and were soon developed in the formation of political parties. The Cono-ress of the Confederation, and \u2014 from the dependence of the Federal Government upon the coopera tion of the States for the performance of its most impor tant duties \u2014 the State legislatures, as well as the public press, became the theatres for the display of these conflict ing opinions. The so-called Government of the Confederation was little else than an alliance between the States \u2014 a federal league and compact, the terms of which were set forth in 3"], [56, "34 POLITICAL PARTIES the Articles of Confederation. Besides a control over ques tions of Peace and War, its powers and duties were chiefly advisory, and dependent for their execution upon the cooperation of the States. A federal system so defective was justly held responsible for a large share of the public and private embarrassments that existed at, or arose after, the termination of the Revolutionary contest. It was also, as was natural, charged in some degree with those which were, in truth, unavoidable consequences of a seven years' war, and which would have existed under any system. It is not surprising, therefore, that a party bent upon its over throw should have arisen as soon as the public mind was by the course of events brought to a proper state to con sider the subject. Of this party Alexander Hamilton became the leader, and its immediate objects were, of course, very soon frankly developed. These were in the first instance to divest the State governments of certain powers, and to confer them upon Congress, the possession of which by the Federal head they deemed indispensable to the exigencies of the public service, with the intention of following up this step by an attempt to abrogate the Articles of Confederation, and to substitute for that system an independent and effective Federal Government, com posed of executive, legislative, and judicial departments. In respect to the powers to be given to the new Govern ment, and to its construction otherwise, there doubtless existed some differences of opinion among the members of this party ; but all agreed that it should be what in the language of the day was called a \" strong government.\" There may not have been entire harmony among them in regard to the expediency and practicability of attemptino it, but I do not think there is reasonable ground to doubt that most of them desired a virtual consolidation of the two systems \u2014 Federal and State. A few were, from an"], [57, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 35 early period, suspected by those who differed from them, and who became their opponents, of desiring to return to the English system, and this suspicion, doubtless, contrib uted to make the latter more impracticable than they might otherwise have been. The political feelings which lay nearest to the hearts of the great body of the people, as well during our colonial condition as in the States after the declaration and estab lishment of Independence, and of the strength of which I have referred to such striking and oft-repeated illustrations, were those of veneration and affection for their local gov ernments as safeguards of their liberties and adequate to most of their wants ; endeared to them as their refuge from the persecutions of arbitrary power, and hallowed by the perils and triumphs of the Revolution. Allied to these feelings, and nearly co-extensive with them in point of duration, was a distrust, at both periods, on the part of the masses, of what they called an overshadowing general government. When to these sources of opposition to the views of the party which had arrayed itself against the government of the Confederation is added the natural and deeply seated hostility of those who dissented from its views in respect to hereditary government in any form, and the suspicion of a reserved preference for such, or at least for kindred institutions, we cannot be at a loss in accounting for the origin of the first two great parties which sprang up and divided the country so soon after the establishment of our Independence. But the names by which these parties were distinguished are, it must be admitted, not so intelligible. The name of Anti-Federalists was strangely enough given by their opponents to those who advocated the continuance of the Union upon the principles which prevailed in its establish-"], [58, "36 POLITICAL PARTIES ment, and according to which it was regarded as a Federal League or Alliance of Free States, upon equal terms, founded upon a compact (the Articles of Confederation) by which its conditions were regulated, \u2014 to be represented by a general Congress, authorized to consider and decide all questions appertaining to the interests of the alliance and committed to its charge, without power either to act upon the people directly or to apply force to the States, or otherwise to compel a compliance with its decrees, and without any guarantee for their execution other than the good faith of the parties to the compact. On the other hand the name of Federalists was assumed, and, what is still more extraor dinary, retained by those who desired to reduce the State governments, by the conjunction of which the Federal Union had been formed, to the condition of corporations to be intrusted with the performance of those offices only for the discharge of which a new general government might think them the appropriate functionaries ; to convert the States, not perhaps in name, but practically and substan tially, into one consolidated body politic, and to establish over it a government which should, at the least, be ren dered independent and effective by the possession of ample powers to devise, adopt, and execute such measures as it might deem best adapted to common defense and general welfare. That this was a signal perversion of the true relation between party names and party objects can scarcely be denied. Yet we who have, in later days, witnessed the caprices in respect to party names to which the public mind has been occasionally subjected, and the facility with which one party has, through its superior address or its greater activity, succeeded in attaching to its adversary an unsuitable and unwelcome name, have not as much reason to be surprised at that perversion as had the men of that day who were subjected to it."], [59, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 37 The motive which operated in thus denying to men whose principles were federal the name which indicated them, and in giving it to their opponents, must be looked for in the fact that federal principles were at that time favored by the mass of the people. This was well under stood at the time, and was made still more apparent by the circumstance that those who really adhered to them, though compelled by the superior address of their adver saries to act under the name of Anti-Federalists, maintained their ascendency in the government of the Confederation to its close. Those who require further proof of the truth of this position beyond what results from a mere statement of the principles contended for by the respective parties, will find it fully sustained by definitions of Gouverneur Morris and James Madison. (2 Madison Papers, pp. 74,7*-8, and 893.) Mr. Morris explained the distinction between a federal and a national supreme government, \u2014 the former being a mere compact resting on the good faith of the parties, the latter having a complete and compulsive opera tion. Mr. Madison, in the debate on the propositions of Mr. Patterson, which constituted the plan of the Anti- Federalists, and which were rejected by a vote of seven States to three, \u2014 one (Maryland) divided, \u2014 said : \"Much stress has been laid by some gentlemen on the want of power in the Convention to propose any other than a federal plan Neither of the characteristics of a federal plan would support this objection. One char acteristic was that in a, federal government the power was exercised, not on the people individually, but on the people collectively, on \"the States. The other characteristic was that a federal government derived its appointments, not immediately from the people, but from the States which they respectively composed.\""], [60, "38 POLITICAL PARTIES It cannot be difficult to decide which of these parties was, in truth, federal, and which anti-federal, according to these authentic definitions of a federal government.1 Between these parties, thenceforth distinguished by the misnomers of Federalists and Anti-Federalists, there was, from the close of the war to the establishment of the present government, an uninterrupted succession of par tisan conflicts, in which the whole country participated. They grew, for the most part, out of propositions to take from the State governments the rights of regulating- com merce and of levying and collecting impost duties, and for the call of a Convention to revise the Articles of Confed eration. The first two of these propositions were intro duced by the Federalists, and for six years vigorously sup ported by their party, with Hamilton at its head ; and, although advocated by Madison whilst he was in Congress, such was the strength of the Anti-Federal party in that body and in the States that they were not able to carry either. Advances were occasionally made in respect to imposts, but these were so restricted as to the officers by whom the duties should be collected, whether State or Federal, and in regard to the application of the money when collected, that the movers of the principal measure considered its value so much impaired that they declined to push it further under the existing circumstances. A distrust of the motives of the Federal leaders, and an apprehension that they designed to employ the powers asked for in the establishment of a strong and absorbing 1 This contradiction between names and principles was obvious even to intelligent foreigners. The French minister Fauchet, in his fa mous despatch to his government (the publication of which worked the downfall of Edmund Randolph, Washington's Secretary of State) alluding to political parties in Amer ica, speaks of the whimsical contrast between their names, Federal and Anti-Federal, and their real opinions ; \u2014 the former aiming with all their power to annihilate federalism, while the latter were striving to preserve it."], [61, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 39 general government, capable of becoming, and which the An ti- Federalists feared would, in the progress of time, become, disposed to practice a tyranny upon the people, as oppressive as* that from which the Revolution had relieved them, with the suspicion already referred to, that many would not be willing to stop at that point, were doubtless the true causes of these otherwise unaccountable failures. The accounts which have been brought down to us of the proceedings of public bodies, and of appeals to the people, through different channels, abundantly sustain this assumption. These, in a work like this, can only be glanced at. The grounds taken by the opponents of these measures, and which, backed by popular suspicions, made them so powerful, were that the views of the Federalists were rather political than financial, \u2014 that they were at least as solic itous to gratify their well-understood passion for power, through the adoption of these propositions, as they were to maintain public credit. Beyond all doubt the belief that the government which the Federalists wished to create would, whatever it might be called, provide for the great est practical extent of irresponsible power, led the Anti- Federalists not unfrequently to oppose measures which they would otherwise have supported. General Hamilton's speech, most able as it was, went far to strengthen these impressions. The debate com menced on the 28th, and was continued to the 30th Janu ary, 1783, and was throughout one of great power. It resulted in the adoption, with slight amendments, of a proposition, submitted and vigorously supported by Mr. Madison, \" That it is the opinion of Congress that the establishment of permanent and adequate funds to operate generally throughout the United States, is indispensably necessary for doing complete justice to the creditors of the"], [62, "40 POLITICAL PARTIES United States, for restoring public credit, and for providing for the future exigencies of the war.\" Although this proposition finally passed without a dissenting vote, yet when an attempt was made to carry it into effect by an impost \u2014 the only way in which it was attempted \u2014 the measure was defeated, as has been before remarked, by restrictions in regard to the officers by whom it should be collected, and to the application of the money. In the course of his speech General Hamilton signified, as an additional reason why the impost ought to be collected by officers under the appointment of Congress, \"that as the energy of the Federal Government was evidently short of the degree necessary for pervading and uniting the States, it was expedient to introduce the influence of officers de riving their emoluments from, and consequently interested in supporting the power of Congress.\" Upon this Mr. Madison, in a note, observes : \" This remark was imprudent and injudicious to the cause which it was meant to serve. This influence was the very source of jealousy which rendered the States averse to a revenue under the collection as well as appropriation of Congress. All the members of Congress who concurred in any degree with the States in this jealousy, smiled at the dis closure. Mr. Bland, and still more Mr. Lee, who were of this number, took notice in private conversation that Mr. Hamilton had let out the secret.\" * It is scarcely possible, at this distant day, to appreciate the terror of irresponsible and arbitrary power which had been impressed upon the minds of men who had them selves suffered from its excesses, or had witnessed the cruelties it had inflicted on others, or whose fathers had been victims of its crimes. Even Mr. Jefferson, who differed from the Anti-Federalists in respect to these ques- 1 i Madison Papers, 291."], [63, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 41 tions, as I shall hereafter have occasion to show, though he sympathized with them in their general feelings, in a letter to Mr. Madison in December, 1787, from Paris, upon the subject of the Constitution, did not hesitate to say, \" I own I am not a friend to a very energetic govern ment. It is always oppressive.\" 1 Similar feelings were exhibited by Massachusetts in 17S5. That leading State in the confederacy was, during the whole of this period, strongly imbued with the feelings of the misnamed Anti-Federal party. This was in no small degree owing to the talents, zeal, and activity dis played in their behalf by Samuel Adams and John Han cock, two of the three persons (John Adams having been the third), who were excepted by the British Government from the offer of pardon to its rebellious subjects. Han cock was a leading merchant and a zealous Revolutionary patriot, who had the honor of placing his name first to the Declaration of Independence, and the higher honor of sus taining the contest which it provoked to its close with in flexible firmness and at unusual risks, growing out of his large interests in commerce. Samuel Adams was equal to any man of his day in intelligence, integrity, and patriotism. He was among the very first who embraced the Revolution in the sense which it finally assumed, \u2014 that of entire sep aration from the British Crown, \u2014 and he supported the principles upon which it was founded, as well during the conflict as for the residue of his long life, with great ability and unsurpassed devotion. Whilst many of his associates, not less sincere than himself in resistance to the despotic acts of the mother country, could yet express their admi ration of the English system and were consequently in clined to limit their efforts to a redress of temporary griev ances, he at the earliest period avowed his hostility to 1 2 Jefferson's Correspondence, 276."], [64, "42 POLITICAL PARTIES kingly government, and rallied around himself the advo cates for an entire separation, most of whom became with him early and prominent members of the Anti-Federal party. The legislature of Massachusetts, momentarily diverted from the Anti-Federal track by influences which will be noticed iu another place, adopted a resolution urging Con gress to recommend a convention of the States \" to revise the Confederation, and to report how far it may be neces sary in their opinion to alter and enlarge the same, in order to secure and perpetuate the primary objects of the Union.\" Governor Bowdoin, who had recommended the measure to the legislature in his message, addressed a letter to Con gress including the resolution, and sent it to the delegates of the State to be presented by them. The delegates sus pended its delivery, and assigned their reasons for doing so in a letter dated September 3, 1785, addressed to the Gov ernor, with a request that it should be laid before the legis lature. From this letter, which is ably written and occupies throughout Anti-Federal ground, I make the following ex tracts : \u2014 \" The great object of the Revolution was the establishment of good government, and each of the States, in forming their own as well as the Federal Constitution, have adopted republican principles. Notwithstanding this, plans have been artfully laid and vigorously pursued, which, had they been successful, we think would have in evitably changed our republican governments into baleful aristocracies. These plans are frustrated, but the same spirit remains in their abettors ; and the institution of Cin cinnati, honorable and beneficent as the views may have been of the officers who composed it, we fear, if not totally abolished, will have the same tendency ' More power in Congress,' has been the cry from all quarters, but especially of those whose views, not being"], [65, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 43 confined to a government that will best promote the happi ness of the people, are extended to one that will afford lucra tive employments, civil and military. Such a government is an aristocracy, which would require a standing army and a numerous train of pensioners and placemen to prop and support its exalted administration. To recommend one's self to such an administration would be to secure an estab lishment for life, and at the same time to provide for his posterity. These are pleasing prospects which republican governments do not afford, and it is not to be wondered at that many persons of elevated views and idle habits in these States are desirous of the change. We are for increasing the power of Congress as far as it will promote the happi ness of the people ; but at the same time, are clearly of opinion that every measure should be avoided which would strengthen the hands of the enemies to free government, and that an administration of the present Confederation, with all its inconveniences, is preferable to the risk of general dis sensions and animosities, which may approach to anarchy and prepare the way to a ruinous system of government.\" This letter of the delegates was laid before the legisla ture at their next session, and produced a vote annulling the resolution recommending a convention. The letter was signed by Elbridge Gerry, Samuel Holton, and Rufus King. Mr. King, in the course of the following year, married Miss Alsop, the only child of John Alsop, a wealthy merchant of New York, and after having repre sented his native State with credit in the Federal Conven tion of 1787, moved to that city; was appointed one of the first senators in Congress from the State of New York (General Schuyler being the other) ; was the friend and associate of Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, and Jay, and became, and continued for many years, a prominent mem ber of the Federal party."], [66, "POLITICAL PARTIES 44 Every step that was taken toward a convention was regarded with distrust, \u2014 a distrust founded on a preva lent apprehension that {he talented and, as was believed, ambitious men who would get the control of it, would in some way defeat those republican principles for the right to establish which the country had made such great sacri fices. The Commercial Convention, representing five States, which originated in Virginia and met at Annapolis, and by which the movement that resulted in the present Constitu tion was commenced, permitted Hamilton to draw up their Address to the other States, which was also to be laid be fore Congress ; but insisted on giving a shape to their proposition which would confine the Federal Convention within narrow bounds. They did this in deference to the well understood sentiment of the country, and as the only course, in their opinion, by which a convention could be obtained ; and accordingly they proposed \" That a conven tion should be called to meet at Philadelphia in May next, to devise such further provisions as should appear to them necessary to render the Constitution of the Federal Gov ernment adequate to the exigencies of the Union, and to report such an act for that purpose to the United States in Congress assembled, as token agreed to by them, and after wards confirmed by the legislatures of every State, will effectually provide for the same.\" 1 The final action of Congress upon the subject, a ma jority of which entertained similar views, consisted of a resolution, introduced by the delegates from Massachu setts, declaring it to be the opinion of Congress that a convention should be held at the time and place named by the Commissioners who met at Annapolis, \" for the sole i See Address ; i Madison, 698.

Washington, as appears from his Corre spondence, would not have deemed a convention legal with out it, and would not have attended;2 and his example, added to the hesitation of most of the States, and the decided opposition of some of them, would have been suf ficient to put a stop to the project. It was under such circumstances that the Convention assembled. Its proceedings have become so familiar to the public mind, from the full publications that have been made of them, and the extent to which they have been reviewed, as to render it unnecessary to go very far into their details. The Anti-Federal plan was introduced by Mr. Patterson, of New Jersey, more in obedience to the ascer tained wishes of his constituents, than in conformity with his particular views. It proposed an amendment of the Articles of Confederation for the construction of execu tive and judicial departments in the federal government ; to make its laws and treaties the supreme law of the land ; to increase the powers of Congress in several important particulars, among which were the right to levy and col lect taxes and imposts, to regulate foreign commerce and commerce between the States, and to give to the fed eral government power to enforce its requisitions upon the 1 Journals of that Congress, Vol. IV. p. 724. 2 Sparks's Washington, Vol. IX. ; Notes, pp. 237-9."], [68, "46 POLITICAL PARTIES States when it should become necessary, \u2014 and to leave the government in other respects as it stood. The plan which Hamilton desired the Convention to propose to the people and the States, of which he left a copy with Mr. Madison as a permanent memorial of his opinions, \u2014 now published with Mr. Madison's \"Papers,\" and in the \"Life of Hamilton\" by his son, and agreeing with each other in all respects, \u2014 consisted, in its most re markable features, of the following provisions, viz : \u2014 First: The President should hold his office during good behavior, removable only on conviction upon impeachment for some crime or misdemeanor ; and he should have an absolute negative upon all bills, resolutions, and acts of Congress about to be passed into a law. Secondly : The Senators should hold their offices by the same tenure, and should have the exclusive power of declaring war. Thirdly : The General Government should have the right to appoint the future Governors of the States, who might hold their offices during good behavior, and who should have the power to negative all laws about to be passed by the respective State legislatures, subject to such regulations as Congress might prescribe, and also to ap point all the militia officers if Congress should so direct ; and, Fourthly: Congress should \"have power to pass all laws which they shall judge necessary to the common defense and general welfare of the Union.\" The first of these plans, which professed to represent the views of the Anti-Federalists, was rejected by the Con vention, after full discussion, as has been already men tioned, by a vote of seven States to three, one being divided. Hamilton's scheme was not brought to a vote, nor, except by himself, made the subject of particular dis-"], [69, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 47 cussion. This course was obviously induced, in no small degree, by motives of respect for the feelings of its author. Every body praised his candor and independence, but the popular opinions in respect to its provisions were too well understood to allow of any vote, other than his own, being given in its favor, whatever private sympathy it may have enlisted. Fortunately for the country at this, perhaps the most decisive period in its history, a majority of the Convention, composed of every shade of opinion, became thoroughly satisfied that a crisis had arrived which demanded a liberal sacrifice of extreme views. They were convinced that whilst, on the one hand, no system would stand the slightest chance to be acceptable to any thing like a majority either of the States or people, which was de signed, or obnoxious to the suspicion of being designed, to degrade the State governments, or even to impair their capacities for the successful management of those portions of public affairs which, under a proper distribution of the powers of government, would be left under their control, or which was in the smallest degree calculated to do vio lence to the well-known feelings of the people upon the subjects of hereditary or irresponsible power ; so, on the other, there was no room for two opinions in respect to the ruinous consequences that would, in the then condition of the country, inevitably result from the failure of a con vention, brought together with so much difficulty, to remedy the manifest defects of the existing government by suitable and effectual additions and improvements, and to make a Constitution which would prove satisfactory both to the States and people. Kept together by this overruling con viction, they entered upon the construction of the present Constitution. The State governments had been until that period, in point of fact, the ruling power. The federal"], [70, "48 POLITICAL PARTIES head, from the want of power to act directly upon the people, or, in a compulsory manner, upon the State author ities, was dependent on them for the execution of its most important decisions. Though much depressed by the adverse current of events, it was yet in the State govern ments that the pride of power stood relatively at the highest point. Any attempt, under such circumstances, to humiliate the State authorities, would inflame the passions of their supporters ; but they 'might be, perhaps, to a sufficient extent conciliated, and the Convention prudently adopted this course. Irritating subjects were, with that view, as far as possible, avoided. Propositions to give to the new government a direct negative upon the legislation of the States, and to empower it to appoint their governors and militia officers, which had produced so much ill blood, were effectually discountenanced. The sovereignty of the States, to which State pride was so keenly alive, was not interfered with in respect to the powers of government which were left in their hands. An impartial and wise division of powers was made between them and the government proposed to be established. To remove appre hensions which had been long entertained, and which had * sunk deep in the minds of many, the State authorities as such were allowed a liberal participation in the first for mation, and their co-operation was made necessary to the subsequent continuance of the new government. The manner of choosing the electors of President and Vice- President was, with the same general view, left to the regulation of the State legislatures exclusively ; and when a failure to choose by the electors should occur \u2014 a result then believed likely to happen frequently \u2014 the President was to be chosen by the House of Representatives of the United States, and, in the performance of that important duty, each State had reserved to it the right to appear aud"], [71, "m THE UNITED STATES. 49 act in its federal character \u2014 that of a perfect equality with her sister States \u2014 whatever might be the difference in their respective population, territory, or wealth. The choice of the Senate of the United States was also left exclusively to the State legislatures. The result of all these arrangements was, that the Federal Constitution was so constructed as to put it in the power of a bare majority of the States to bring the government proposed by it to a peaceable end, without exposing their citizens to the neces sity of resorting to force, by simply withholding the ap pointment of electors, or the choice of their Senators, or both. No provisions could have been devised better calculated to remove apprehension and allay jealousy in respect to the new government. They hit the nail on the head. Al though they might not avert the opposition of excited par tisans, they answered the expectations of moderate men, \u2014 of that large class whose paramount object was the relief of the country as well as their own private affairs from the embarrassments under which they were suffering, and which were, as usual on such occasions, attributed alto gether to the defects of the existing system. The question could with great propriety be put to Anti-Federal opponents (and doubtless was put), \u2014 Are you afraid to trust a nu merical majority of the States \\ If not, they can at short intervals put an end to the new government if it proves to be as bad as you apprehend. Having already, in a spirit of devotion to duty and a hazardous disregard of responsibility which was made necessary by the occasion, set aside the instructions of Congress by making a new Constitution, the Convention pursued a similar course to the end. Instead of report ing the result of their labors to Congress for its ap proval and submission to the States for their unanimous 4"], [72, "50 POLITICAL PARTIES sanction, according to the Articles of Confederation, as was proposed at Annapolis and provided by Congress in the act of sanction to the holding of the Convention, that body sent the instrument it had framed to Congress, not for its approval, but to be by it submitted to the States and people in the first instance, under a provision, pre scribed by the Convention, that if it was ratified by nine of the thirteen States it should be binding upon all, \u2014 an heroic though perhaps a lawless act. The dangerous condition of the country, and the general opinion that some decided step was necessary to its safety, added to the imposing character of the instrument itself, which, though not satisfactory to Congress, was yet far less objectionable than had been anticipated, and a general expectation that important amendments rendering it still more acceptable to the people would follow its ratification, deterred the national legislature from refusing to comply with the request of the Convention, notwithstanding its flagrant disregard of congressional authority. The same considerations should have induced the Anti-Federal party to acquiesce in the ratification of the Constitution. They should have looked upon the marked effect of that instru ment upon Congress as a prophetic warning of the danger to which they would expose themselves as a party by op posing it. But they did not see their duty, or, perhaps, their interests, in that light ; honest in their intentions and obstinate in their opinions, they opposed the ratification, were defeated, and, as a party, finally overthrown. The Anti-Federal party represented very fairly the ideas and feelings that prevailed with the masses during the Revolution. These, as we have described, having been deeply rooted by the persecutions suffered by Puritan, Huguenot, Hussite, and Dutch ancestors, and, however crude and unsystematized at first, having been gradually"], [73, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 51 stimulated into maturity and shape by the perseverino- in justice of the mother country, became political opinions of the most tenacious and enduring character. At the mo ment of which we are speaking, alarm in respect to the character of the General Government about to be estab lished, with increased attachments to those of the States, were predominant feelings in the Anti-Federal mind, and closed it against a dispassionate consideration of the Con stitution submitted to their choice. The local governments were entitled to all the regard which had been cherished for them by the Anti-Federalists and by their political predecessors under the colonial system ; neither were the dangers which threatened them overrated. Hamilton could not tolerate the idea that they should be continued otherwise than as corporations, with very limited powers. Morris, in his usual rough and strong way, was for \" drawing their teeth,\" as I have already quoted him ; and even the temperate Madison was in favor of giving the General Government a direct negative upon all their laws, \u2014 a proposition which, though not so humiliating as Hamilton's, or so harshly expressed as that of Morris, would have been far more fatal to their future usefulness. Standing now on the vantage-ground of experience, no sensible man can fail to see that the State governments would have perished under the treatment thus proposed for them, nor can any such man doubt the immense advan tage they have been and still are to our system. A short reflection upon what has been accomplished through their agency, and upon what our condition would probably have been if they had been blotted out of the system, as was virtually desired in most influential quarters, must satisfy candid and intelligent minds of the fatal unsoundness of the policy proposed. The States would under it have been governed as her numerous colonies were governed by Rome,"], [74, "52 POLITICAL PARTIES and a comparison of our present condition with what it must have been under the satraps of a consolidated federal gov ernment, will cause every patriotic heart to rejoice at our escape from the latter. For that escape we are largely indebted to the old Anti-Federal party. They stood out longest and strongest in behalf of the State governments, after the establishment of our Independence ; and although they failed in other respects, they made impressions upon the public mind which have never been effaced, and for which we owe them a debt of gratitude. Their motives, as is usual in political collisions, were misrepresented ; they were spoken of as men of contracted views, of narrow prejudices ; and their preference for the State governments was attributed to the preponderance they possessed in them, and to a consciousness that their greatness and power were derived from local prejudices and from their skill in fomenting them. Hence was inferred their hos tility to an efficient federal government, whose extensive affairs they were incapable of managing, and in which, consequently, it was alleged that they would not retain the influence they possessed at home. Although I unite fully in condemning the course pur sued by the Anti-Federalists in respect as well to the Con stitution as to their refusal to grant an adequate revenue to the federal head, and the right to regulate commerce, I regard those imputations which ascribed to them a readi ness to sacrifice the great interests of the country to merely factious purposes, as the ebullitions of party spleen produced by party jealousies, as unjust and unfounded as was the charge brought forward by the old Republican party against Alexander Hamilton of a design to plunge the country into war with France to subserve the wishes and interests of England. I do not think there were ten in every hundred of that party who did not believe that"], [75, "TN THE UNITED STATES. 53 imputation well founded, and most of them went to their graves without having yielded that conviction. I came upon the political stage when this matter was only viewed in the retrospect, and am free to say that I even believed that, if there was any thing true in the party criminations of the preceding era, this was so. Judge, then, of my surprise, on discovering from his papers, as well as from those of some of his contemporaries recently published, that there was probably no man in the country more sincerely anxious to prevent a war with France ; that he applied his great mind incessantly to that object ; that he was willing, indeed desirous, to send either Mr. Jefferson or Mr. Madi son as one of the commissioners to negotiate with France, a proposition in respect to which he could not obtain the concurrence of either Mr. Adams or his cabinet, the latter of whom were sufficiently prompt to adopt his advice save when it conflicted with their party prejudices ; and that so far from acting on that occasion at the instigation or to promote the policy of Great Britain, although entertaining strong \u2014 in my opinion too strong \u2014 preferences forEngland as between her and France, he was, in respect to every thing that affected the interests of his own country, purely and strictly American. Of this no man, whose mind is not debauched by prejudice, can entertain a doubt on read ing the papers referred to. The imputations upon the motives of the Anti-Federalists were of the same general stamp and origin. It was too soon for those who were yet fresh from the self-sacrificing and patriotic struggle on the field of the Revolution, where they had nobly done their duty, to fall under the influence of such petty motives as were attributed to them. Like their opponents, they might and did peril much of their own standing to further political views of great magnitude which they honestly, if erroneously, believed would pro-"], [76, "54 POLITICAL PARTIES mote the welfare of their country ; but base incentives and merely factious calculations are not predicable of the times or of the men. We should be slow to attribute narrow views to a polit ical party to whose principal leaders, more than to any other portion of the Whigs, we owe the great change in the character of our Revolutionary struggle by which the assertion of Independence was substituted for the demand of a redress of grievances. If the Anti-Federal party had been accused of cherishing morbid and impracticable ideas on the subject of a general government, the charge would have come nearer the truth. Many of them had so vivid a recollection of cruelties prac ticed upon their fathers, and had themselves seen and felt so much of the tyranny of the mother country, as to de stroy all hope on their part that political power could be vested in remote hands, without the certainty of its being abused. Although they may have been right in respect to the monarchical preferences of many who were the most zealous for a convention, still they overrated the danger that such views would be encouraged by that body, and in their apprehensions of subsequent efforts to establish mo narchical institutions here, they did not sufficiently appre ciate an existing security against the accomplishment of such an object, the character and adequacy of which shall be hereafter noticed. We have every reason to believe that they regarded the project of a general convention as involv ing, if successful, the fate of republican principles in this country ; and under the influence of feelings of so sombre a character, their course, as a party, was, it must be ad mitted, substantially adverse to any change, content rather to bear the ills they had than to encounter others of which they knew not the precise extent, but which they dreaded more. In this they fell behind the progress of events."], [77, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 55 If our Revolutionary contest had terminated in a com promise with the mother country, as was for a long time expected, the existing system, with the amendments which would then have been generally favored, might have suf ficed. It might have answered all the purposes contem plated by that which Franklin took so much pains to estab lish in 1755. But when our country had taken her position among the nations of the earth as a sovereign and independent power, she acquired rights and incurred obli gations which could not be properly cared for by any agency short of a well-constructed and efficient general government, and the existing organization was neither. By an efficient government I do not mean one capable of absorbing or neutralizing the State authorities, or not fully responsible for the faithful exercise of the powers conferred upon it, or possessing more power than was necessary for the discharge of all the duties assigned to it, but one amply furnished with the ability to discharge them by its own means. To this end it was necessary that it should have competent and well organized executive, legislative, and judicial departments, and at least the power requisite to raise its necessary revenues from the people directly. To all this the Anti-Federal party was opposed, and therein it was wrong. The risk of having exceptionable princi ples incorporated into the Constitution was one that had to be encountered at some time, and there were cogent reasons for meeting it then. The condition of the country, in regard to its credit and other interests, presented an argu ment of great urgency for the necessity of a competent government. But above all other considerations stood the fact that the Convention had proposed for the approval of the people and the States a constitution which, when in terpreted according to its plain and obvious meaning, con ferred on the government proposed by it powers fully"], [78, "56 POLITICAL PARTIES adequate to the public service, but none from which danger could be apprehended to any interest. That this was so is no longer an open question. Time and experience have demonstrated the error of the Anti-Federalists, who, under the influence of strong prejudices, although doubtless hon estly, thought differently. No one will now question the devotion of the people, for whose benefit it was framed, and who are the best judges in the matter, to the existing system. With full power to alter or abolish it, they have lived under it for the greater part of a century, without making or desiring to make any essential alterations in its structure. By the exercise of those powers only which were plainly given by the Constitution to the government established by its authority and expressed on its face, in regard to which there has been no dispute, and which were at the times of its adoption well understood by those who made and those who adopted it, our country has prospered and grown to its present greatness. I say by those powers only, because the spurious interpolations which have from time to time been attempted have in no instance been productive of good. The Convention was held with closed doors, and the result of its labors was not known to the public before it was communicated to Congress, nor the particulars of its proceedings, the votes, resolutions, and speeches, till many years afterwards. The public mind, and especially the Anti-Federal portion of it, was impressed by those circum stances, operating upon long entertained suspicions, with the most unfavorable anticipations in respect to the charac ter of the instrument that had been agreed upon. All found it so different from what it was feared by many that it would be, and so many received it according to its real merits, that it carried a large preponderance of the public sentiment, drawn from both parties, to the conclusion that"], [79, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 57 it ought not to be, and could not with safety be rejected. The reflection of this sentiment was distinctly seen in the action of Congress. It had given its assent to the holding of a Convention, without which that body would not have met ; but it had, as we have seen, restricted its action in two most important points : 1st, that the Convention should limit its action to a revision of the Articles of Confedera tion and to suggestions for their improvement ; and, 2d, that its doings should be reported to Congress, to be submitted to the States, under those Articles which required the assent of every State to any alteration. The Convention disregarded both ; it sent to Congress a new constitution, regulated its submission to the States, and decided that the assent of nine of the thirteen should make it binding upon all. Congress, with its resolutions and limitations thus set at nought, and without even a protest, did what was asked of it. Yet the leaders of the Anti-Federal party in the States determined upon opposition. The course and char acter of that opposition indicate that those who embarked in it were conscious of their approaching defeat. In the three largest aud most strongly Anti-Federal States, in which the power of that party, when cordially united, was irresistible, the Constitution was ratified. It was adopted by the required number of States, and the fate of the Anti- Federal party, as such, was forever sealed by the result of the contest in which it had unwisely engaged."], [80, "POLITICAL PARTIES 58 CHAPTER II.

The successful effort that had been made to compel Great Britain to acknowledge our Independence ; the government of the Confederation, and the causes that led to its aban donment ; the grave step taken in a better direction by the formation and ratification of the new Constitution, with the hopes and fears excited by the last great movement, were well calculated to impress profoundly the minds of those who had been actors in such important scenes. The suc cess of the Federal party in the first election held under the new Constitution was complete. For the first time since"], [81, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 59 its organization, that party possessed the unrestricted'con trol of the national legislature. If any thing could have been thought wanting to insure its permanent success, that was believed to be secured by the consent of General Washington to be the first President of the new govern ment about to be organized under a constitution, to the paternity of which they had established so fair a claim. Neither the formation nor the ratification of that instru ment were altogether the work of avowed members of that party ; but as between the two parties they had clearly the best title to be regarded as its authors. The merits of individuals in that great work were various. Alexander Hamilton, the able and undisputed leader of the Federal party, from its origin to his death, did comparatively noth ing either toward its formation or adoption by the Federal Convention. His most useful services were rendered in the New York State Convention, by which it was rati fied, and in his contributions to the numbers of \"The Federalist.\" These were formally declared as the measure of his services in that regard, in reply to a direct inquiry long after Hamilton's death, by his best informed aud always devoted friend, Gouverneur Morris, as will be seen hereafter. It was, beyond all doubt, from Madison that the Constitution derived its greatest aid in respect as well to its construction as to its passage through the Convention, and its ratification by the States. \u00bb The character and political career of James Madison were sui genevis \u2014 as much so as though far different from those of John Randolph. Possessed of intellectual powers inferior to none, and taking an unsurpassed interest in the course of public affairs, he seemed invariably to bring to the discussion of public questions a thoroughly unprejudiced mind. Whilst in the speeches of his contem poraries we seldom fail to perceive that the argument sub-"], [82, "60 POLITICAL PARTIES mitted was framed to support a foregone conclusion, \u2014 to recommend a measure for which the speaker cherished a personal preference, \u2014 it is rare indeed, if ever, that any such indications are to be found in xhose of Mr. Madison. Whilst the former present themselves as advocates, the latter appears in the attitude of an umpire between rival opinions, who has made it his business to search for the truth, and is determined to abide the result of his investi gations, uninfluenced in the formation of his decision by preferences or prejudices of any description. The most acute observer in reviewing the writings, speeches, and votes of Mr. Madison during the exciting periods of which we are speaking, when governments as well as individuals were to an unusual extent in a state of transition, would find it difficult to place his finger upon any of them in respect to which the justice of this description would not be manifest. Mr. John Quincy Adams, in his Jubilee Address, heretofore alluded to, describes* Mr. Madison and General Hamilton as being, at this period, \" spurred to the rowels by ambition.\" 1 Both of these gentlemen were, doubtless, ambitious of the fame which is acquired by serving one's country honestly and efficiently, and we have no sufficient reason for assuming that Mr. Adams meant more than that. It is, nevertheless, but justice to those truly great men to add that so far as high-reaching ambition is indi cated by abjuring unpopular opinions and assuming those which are believed to be otherwise ; by professing attach ment to principles not really cherished for their own sake, or by personal intrigues of any description to acquire or 1 Mr. Van Buren, in making the Adams; but they, in fact, refer dis. above quotation from the Jubilee tinctly to Jefferson and Hamilton, Address, doubtless rehed upon h.s though Mr. Madison's name is in. memory. 44 Both spurred to the cidentally coupled with that of the rowels by r.val and antagonist am- latter in the same sentence.

Mr. Madison's course at the period of which we are speak ing and during his antecedent public life, was, to a remark able extent, divested of a partisan character. He sup ported, ably and perseveringly, many, if not most of the propositions for the adoption of which the Federal party was particularly solicitous, whilst representing one of the most decided Anti-Federal States in the Confederacy, with out losing the confidence of his constituents, or even hazarding its loss. He was, throughout, in favor of giving to the federal head an independent right to levy and col lect its necessary revenue and to regulate commerce, and was from the beginning in favor of a convention to revise the Constitution. In that body he was one of the major ity in favor of the course I have described, and which resulted in the present Constitution. His successful and brilliant efforts in favor of the new system of government placed him at the head of its friends ; but there was no time when Mr. Madison can, with truth and fairness, be said to have belonged to the Federal party ; he all the time represented a State which took the lead in opposition to that school, his political affinities and associations were in general adverse to that organization, and, as I have said, he never forfeited the good opinion of his State. She seems always to have confided in his sincerity and in the integrity of his motives, and to have been willing to allow him to follow the dictates of his own judgment in regard to particular measures. The most auspicious prospects beamed upon the opening administration of the new government, and it is fair to presume that the anticipations thus inspired would have been triumphantly realized if those who had been selected to conduct it, and their successors for the ensuing twelve"], [84, "POLITICAL PARTIES 62 years, had accepted the Constitution in the sense in which it was known to have been understood by those who framed it, and by the people when they adopted it. A course thus right in itself, and thus acquiescent in the popular will by men, some of whom had been long suspected by many of their Revolutionary associates of not holding that will in very high respect, would not have failed to conciliate large portions of the Anti-Federal party. Their dread of the exercise of unauthorized power by a general govern ment, of which the responsibility was, in their estimation, too remote to be safely trusted, and their apprehensions for the safety of State institutions, always an object of their greatest solicitude, might have been allayed, if not substantially subdued. These valuable objects accom plished, the great improvements in the condition as well of public as of individual affairs, unavoidably flowing from the reasonably harulonious action of a government which the Federal party had done so much to establish, and the crowning fact that these gratifying results were brought about in the name, and with the active coop eration of Washington, the object of universal respect and affection, would have secured to that party through the long lapse of time that has since intervened, at least as large a share in the control of the government as has been possessed by a party which became its successful rival, but which can scarcely be said to have then existed. But the Federal party rashly turned its back upon the only course by which these advantages might have been se cured, and in doing so, showed itself regardless of consider ations which would not have escaped the attention of more discreet, if not wiser bodies. Its influential and leading men forgot that the administration did not, in point of fact, represent the political opinions in respect to the proper uses and spirit of governments in general of a majority"], [85, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 63 of the people ; that their party had acquired power solely by its wise course in regard to a single, though doubtless most important measure ; and that even in respect to that large portions of the people felt, as expressed by John Quincy Adams, \" that the Constitution itself had been extorted from the grinding necessity of a reluctant nation.\" The Federal party took its course also in momentary for getfulness of the characters of those whose opinions it was about to violate, whose feelings were to be offended, and whose resentments it must incur. It overlooked what it had the fullest reason to know, that those whom it was about to drive into opposition were men, and the descend ants of men, who had from the beginning, and at all times, and under all circumstances, been enthusiasts in devotion to liberty, and stern and uncompromising in de manding stringent restrictions upon delegated authority, \u2014 as inflexible in their opinions, and as incapable of being driven from their support by the hand of power, or se duced by corruption, as human nature could be made in the schools of fiery trial in which they had been trained. The Federalists in power, or rather he who, through the great confidence of his chief, wielded that power, did noth ing, if we except the personal efforts of Washington in favor of conciliation, absolutely nothing to soothe the feel ings of their defeated opponents, or to allay their appre hensions, but much to exacerbate the former and to confirm the latter. The justice of these allegations is fully proved by the acts of the public men of that day. From the official position of the first President, and the part he consequently took in the management of public affairs, a faithful survey of these cannot be made without embracing him in the review. This is treading upon privileged ground. l\\o American, no good man, can approach it without feeling"], [86, "POLITICAL PARTIES 64 that it is such, or without being embarrassed by the appre hension that, however pure his intention, he may undesign edly outrage the sentiments of admiration and reverence by which it is naturally and properly intrenched. General Washington retired gracefully from his military command, with more true glory than ever fell to the lot of man. There have, doubtless, at times, appeared military leaders of more professional genius and science, but never one better adapted to the high duties to which he was called ; never one of whom it could with more truth be said, to use a modern and comprehensive expression, that he was \" the right man in the right place.\" Certainly without his seeking it, and doubtless against his wishes, he was trans ferred to the civil service of his country by his election to the office of President under the new Constitution. The administration, of which he thus became the constitutional head, adopted certain measures, proposed others, and set up claims to power under that instrument, of which many of his countrymen and personal friends could not approve, and which they felt themselves obliged to oppose ; these, in the progress of time and events, became organized as a political party by which those objectionable measures and claims of power were perseveringly resisted, but without any diminution of respect for his character, position, and feelings. They overthrew the administration of his suc cessor, which claimed to act upon his principles, succeeded to the control of the Federal Government, and have kept it ever since, with rare and limited exceptions, attributable to special causes. There is, notwithstanding, in this great country, no ham let, town, city, or place in which American citizens congre gate, where the name of Washington is ever pronounced without the profoundest reverence, or in which there does not prevail an undying sense of gratitude for his public"], [87, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 65 services. The history of the world will be searched in vain for a tribute of love and gratitude at all comparable to that which the people of the United States have ren dered to him who was the commander of their armies in the war of the Revolution, and their first republican chief magistrate \u2014 a tribute, in paying which the only contest between political parties is as to which shall manifest the most zeal, and which shall attain the highest success. Was ever before so great and so gratifying reward be stowed, including in its wide extent the noble, exalted, and well - won title of Patev Patrice ! This, the highest honor that man can receive on earth, was not, as of old, a title given to an adored chief by victorious soldiers who, however renowned for their valor, were always open to the influence of personal and temporary feelings ; nor was it obtained through the instrumentality of a venal senate; neither did it originate in state-craft or priest-craft, which have in every age paid homage to the great men of the world for selfish and sinister purposes. The high honors paid to Washington proceeded from no such sources, nor were they exposed to the suspicions from which such be stowments are rarely free. They sprang from the disinter ested and deliberate judgment of an intelligent, virtuous, and free people, who felt that he had, in his military capac ity alone, done incomparably more than any other man for the establishment of their Independence, and that in all his civil service he had been actuated by the same upright motives which had governed his whole previous career, and that in that sphere also, as in every act of his life, he had placed the performance of public duties and the advancement of public interests before all other earthly considerations. Although many of them had differed from him in respect to some measures which had received his sanction, they were not on that account the less satisfied 5"], [88, "66 POLITICAL PARTIES that he had, in the exercise of a rightful discretion, been influenced only by an earnest desire to promote the welfare of his country. So regarding his whole career, they with one accord gave him the highest place on the roll of fame and the first in their hearts. This spontaneous and ample recognition of a debt of imperishable gratitude to a public benefactor, whose mod esty was equal to his unsurpassed merit, was the act of a people often misrepresented, and as often misunderstood, but who have never been found wanting, in the end, in what was due to faithful public servants, to themselves, or to their political institutions. We are, perhaps, yet too near the period of these great transactions to pronounce safely upon the general justice of their dealings with the contemporaries of Washington. But when time shall have relieved the subject more thoroughly from the adverse influences of family con nections and partisan feelings, I have not a doubt that some American historian, loving his country and admiring the character of his countrymen, will take pleasure in holding up to the world a picture of the distribution of popular confidence and popular favors in their case also, which may safely be compared with that drawn from the history of any people. Unbelievers may gainsay, and disappointed aspirants may rail at these deductions, but they nevertheless do no more than justice to the character of our people, before whom every public question and the acts and opinions of every public man, be he whom he may, may be freely can vassed. All that can be asked of him who seeks to vindi cate and perpetuate the truth of history, is that he shall deal justly and candidly with his subject. From a scrutiny so conducted, no citizen will ask or expect that any public transaction, or the course of any public man shall be ex empted."], [89, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 67 No man could have accepted office with fewer tempta tions to depart from the line of duty than offered them selves to President Washington. His claims to the admi ration of his countrymen and of the world were complete ; reasonable in all his desires and happy in his domestic re lations, he was possessed of property beyond either his wants or his desires, and was without children to inherit his estate or to succeed to the glories already attached to his name. The advantages to be derived by a republican magistrate from the consciousness of occupying such a position and of its being also appreciated by his constituents, are very great. The confidence inspired by these con siderations was also strengthened by the fact that in the high and responsible stations in which he had been placed he had never failed to increase the good-will and respect of those by whom he had been appointed. But these circum stances of encouragement did not blind his cautious mind to a proper sense of the difficulties incident to the new duties he had assumed and to his want of experience in re gard to them. In addition to the command of all the military force in the country in a more plenary form than that in which he had before possessed it, he was now in trusted with the superintendence and direction of large por tions of the domestic and of all the foreign concerns of a great people just taking their position in the family of na tions. First on the list of his responsible duties stood that of organizing a government constructed upon new and to a great extent untried principles, at a moment when the ten dency of the French Revolution had been sufficiently de veloped to threaten political convulsions more portentous and more difficult to be dealt with than any that the world had ever witnessed ; and he was called to the performance of this delicate task amidst party dissensions at home of the most violent nature, which many people apprehended"], [90, "68 POLITICAL PARTIES might extend to a revolution in the character of the govern ment itself. Firm in all his purposes Washington did not shrink from the application of his well-balanced mind to a survey of the difficulties that stood in his way, in making which no exaggerated estimate of his own capacities pre vented him from foreseeing the embarrassments that might arise, and to some extent must arise, from the difference in the nature of many of the duties he was now called upon to discharge from those with which his past public life had made him familiar ; and I have always thought that, among the great transactions of his career, there was scarcely one in which were exhibited more strikingly the strength of his judgment and the nobleness of his disposi tion, than in the formation of his first Cabinet. It is difficult for one not particularly conversant with such matters to realize the obstructions which not unfre quently present themselves in the work of forming a good cabinet. These are sometimes the consequence of an over estimate of his own qualifications on the part of the chief magistrate elect, and a resulting disinclination to bring into the government men whose prominence before the country and whose great accomplishments as statesmen may depress his own importance in the action of the administration. This feeling, when it exists in only a moderate degree, is certain to be encouraged by the flat teries of friends, or more often by selfish men for the pur pose of promoting their designs upon the patronage at the disposal of the incumbent. Against the dangerous in fluences of these classes President Washington was effectually guarded by elements in his own character de cidedly unpropitious to both. But he was not so free from embarrassments arising from another source. He was at the commencement of his government surrounded by his fel low-soldiers, the officers of the army of the Revolution,"], [91, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 69 veterans who had acquired high consideration by their meritorious services, and were endeared to him by their personal characters and their past and present sufferings. They were generally men whose judgments he could not but respect, and who, like their class in all countries, were not disposed to consider the aid of civilians in the adminis tration of public affairs as imperatively necessary. The actual state of the country also, in regard to its party divis ions and dissensions, was, as I have already said, perhaps the greatest source of perplexity and trouble. Not discouraged by these difficulties, he proceeded to the formation of his cabinet in a spirit of patriotism and good sense, manifesting an anxious desire to allay, if he could not neutralize, the violence of party spirit, and to enlist in the administration of the new government and secure to the public service those of highest character and talents who belonged to, or were disposed to sympathize with, the party which had opposed the Constitution. With these noble views, he divided his cabinet equally between gen tlemen of that school and members of the Federal party, and equally also between civilians and military men. For the two most responsible, as well as most difficult offices, to which were assigned duties least familiar to himself, he selected two gentlemen, who from their active patriotism and distinguished talents occupied high, if not the highest positions in the country, had already been placed at the head of the rival and conflicting opinions which divided it, and of whose personal uprightness and political independ ence he was well assured. Down to the period which we have now reached, President Washington had, to a remarkable extent, kept himself aloof from partisan strife. This was partly owing to his great self-command and to his perception of the in compatibility of a participation in that field of action with"], [92, "70 POLITICAL PARTIES the positions he occupied in the public service ; and possibly, to some extent, to anticipations, not unnatural, that the future held in store for him a fame which would soar above parties. He had seen and known too much of men to allow himself to hope that the cabinet he had selected would be entirely free from disunion, or from those dis- tractions likely to arise from the conflicting materials of which it was composed ; but he did not at first appreciate fully the extent and bearing of the differences that existed between the opinions and public views of Jefferson and Hamilton. Hoping that these would be confined to par- ticular points in the administration of affairs, he doubtless relied upon his personal influence to soothe the asperities they might produce, and at least to limit their adverse effect to the measures to which they might be from time to time applied. His confidence in this regard was well warranted by his past good fortune in removing obstacles that threat- ened injury to the country, by means of the general respect that was paid to his opinions and wishes by all classes of his countrymen. His success in allaying the spirit of in- subordination that manifested itself among the officers of the army at Newburgh and for a season menaced seriously the character of the army and the peace of the country; in arresting a design which was supposed to be on foot in Congress, to make the sufferings and consequent indig- nation of the troops subservient to the promotion of the financial schemes of civilians; and in dispersing the storm which threatened to follow the establishment of the Cincin- nati, with its hereditary honors, strikingly justified his con- fidence in the efficacy of any future efforts in the same direction. More could not have been done, or in a better spirit, than Washington did to preserve harmony between the two % leading members of his cabinet, and to secure their co-"], [93, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 71 operation in the public service. No steps, consistent with a proper self-respect, as it now appears, were omitted on his part. If the differences in their views had been less radical these friendly efforts and applications must have succeeded, received as they were by both in the most be coming and grateful spirit. But these commendable exertions were doomed to an unavoidable and final disappointment. The President might as well have attempted to combine the elements of tfire and water as to secure a harmonious action in the administration of the Government between Jefferson and Hamilton. The antagonistic opinions of these great men upon the subjects of government and its proper adminis- tration were too profoundly planted in their breasts, and they were both too honest to depart from them without a corresponding change in their convictions, which there was no reason to anticipate, to admit of a hope for a different result. Of the nature and extent of their differences of opinion it is my purpose to attempt some explanation in another place ; but here I will only say, as I desire to say in ad vance, that I do not now believe, whatever my impression may have been, that they originated in any difference as to the objects at which they aimed, or that those objects, in either case, were other than the welfare and happiness of those for whom they were selected to act. They may have differed in opinion in respect to the condition, social and political, in which the mass of the people would be most likely to be prosperous and happy ; they certainly did so, and that very widely, in regard to the public measures by which that prosperity and happiness would be promoted or diminished ; and that diversity in their opin ions arose mainly from their conflicting estimates of the capacity of the people for self-government. Upon that"], [94, "72 POLITICAL PARTIES point they were opposed diametrically, and that opposition produced an unavoidable antagonism in their views of al most every public question. In a conversation between these gentlemen in 1791 , to which a more particular reference will be made hereafter, General Hamilton thus expressed himself: \u2014 \"For that mind must be really depraved which would not prefer the equality of political rights, which is the foundation of pure republicanism, if it can be obtained consistently with order.\" This was, I do not in the least doubt, his real sentiment ; but unhappily circumstances, to which we may hereafter recur, had impressed his mind with a conviction, which was never removed, that the great desideratum which he mentioned \u2014 the preservation of order \u2014 could not be secured where the control of public affairs was largely in the hands of the people. He very correctly regarded the security of the rights of persons and of property as an indispensable ingredient in good govern ment ; and distrusting the respect of the people, when acting in masses, for both, he was adverse to that equality of rights which he truly said was \" the foundation of pure republicanism.\" These great objects he thought could in no other way be secured than by a strong government, in which there would be what he called a \" stable will,\" inde pendent of popular control. This he endeavored openly, and with a candor that belonged to his character, to obtain in the Convention, and failing there, he hoped to realize its advantages, in some degree, by strengthening what he described as the \"organs\" of the Government, through the action of a popular President and a good administra tion. The most important of the measures by which he designed to accomplish these objects Mr. Jefferson re garded as so many violations of the Constitution, and he looked upon the spirit in which they had their origin as"], [95, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 73 evidence of disaffection to republican government. The differences in opinion between these master spirits of the cabinet, who engrossed a share of the attention of the people inferior only to that paid to the President, were, therefore, not limited, as Washington hoped they would be, to particular measures, but presented contradictory and irreconcilable theories for the administration of the Govern ment, which could not even be discussed in the cabinet without producing interminable distractions. As was to be expected from minds like theirs their respective systems left no middle ground, and required the adoption of the one or the other as a rule of action for the Government. The unavoidable obligation to make a selection between them devolved therefore on Washington, and he discharged it, as he did all his duties, courteously and firmly. He gave the preference to Hamilton, and sustained him in the measures he proposed to carry out the policy he recom mended. Mr. Jefferson, sensible that the necessity of his retire ment from the cabinet had thus become absolute, deter mined to take that step in a way as little annoying to the President and as little injurious to the public service as possible. To this end he gave early notice that he would resign at the expiration of the President's first term of office ; and when that time arrived he retired. This left General Hamilton without any check from his associates in the administration, save what might proceed from the Attorney General, Edmund Randolph, who became Secre tary of State on Jefferson's retirement, and of whom the latter said that his habit was to give his opinions to his friends and his votes to his opponents. Thus, next to Washington, Alexander Hamilton became the most powerful man in the nation, abundantly able to give to party divisions their form and pressure, and in"], [96, "74 POLITICAL PARTIES effect to shape the action of the Government according to his judgment by the authority with which he was invested, and which he exerted with less restraint than had ever before or has ever since been encountered by any minister in this country or in Europe. To no quarter, therefore, could our attention be more profitably directed for instruction in the history and course of parties during his political career than to the opinions and acts of that remarkable man. The time has been, I am sensible, when, with vision distorted by partisan preju dices, which seldom allow both sides of any question to be seen, I could not have reviewed his course with the impar tiality due to truth and justice ; but I am happy to believe that those feelings have sufficiently lost their force to permit me, while dissenting more thoroughly than ever from his principles, to do justice to his motives, and to admit his sincerity and his desire to serve his country in the very acts which I unreservedly condemn. The most obnoxious of his opinions have here, thank God, become obsolete and exploded theories, not at all dangerous as examples, and mainly referred to as historical marks of our progress. Believing, as I think all liberal minds now do, that they were honestly formed, we can speak of them without reproach to their author, and censure them without being suspected of a design to cast obloquy on his mem ory. The history of our partisan warfare has presented, since his time, the anomalous feature of a perseverino denial in his name, by some of his followers, of the political opinions which he not only did not affect to dis claim, but which he made it his business on all fittino occasions to publish and advocate, believing them to be right, and to the last moment of his life confidently ex pecting that they would become, at no distant day, the general sentiment of the country."], [97, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 75 I have already referred to contemporaneous declarations, made in April, 1791, by John Adams and Alexander Hamilton, at an informal meeting of General Washing ton's Cabinet, to which the Vice-President had been invited, in favor of monarchical institutions according to the English model. The terms in which those gentlemen expressed their admiration of, and preference for, the English system of government, though differing in par ticulars, were in no sense equivocal, nor can there be, at this day, the slightest doubt of their authenticity. On the 13th of August, in the same year, General Hamilton held another conversation with Mr. Jefferson, of which the latter leaves the following notes : \u2014 \" I own,\" said Hamilton, \" it is my own opinion, though I do not publish it in Dan or Beersheba, that the present government is not that which will answer the ends of society by giving stability and protection to its rights, and that it will probably be found to be expedient to go into the British form. However, since we have undertaken the experiment, I am for giving it a fair course, whatever my expectations may be. The success, indeed, is so far greater than I had expected, and therefore success seems more possible than it had done heretofore! and there are still other and other stages of improvement which, if the present does not succeed, mtiy be tried and ought to be tried before we give up the republican form altogether ; for that mind must be really depraved which would not prefer the equality of political rights, which is the foun dation of pure republicanism, if it can be obtained con sistently with order. Therefore whoever by his writings disturbs the present order of things is really blamable, however pure his intentions may be, and he was sure Mr. Adams's were pure.\" \"This,\" Mr. Jefferson adds in his memorandum, \"is"], [98, "76 POLITICAL PARTIES the substance of a declaration made in much more lengthy terms, and which seemed to be more formal than usual for a private conversation between two, and as if intended to qualify some less guarded expressions which had been dropped on former occasions. Thomas Jefferson has com mitted it to writing the moment of Alexander Hamilton's leaving the room.\" The measures described by Hamilton as the stages of improvement already adopted were doubtless the bank and funding system, and those still in reserve were such as are recommended in his report on manufactures, sub sequently made. In the Federal Convention Avhich framed our present Constitution General Hamilton submitted a series of propositions to be adopted as a basis for the new govern ment, which he supported in an elaborate and very able speech. The debates of the Convention were reported by Mr. Madison, who submitted the notes he had taken of his speech to General Hamilton, which the latter admitted to be correct, contenting himself with a few formal and ver bal amendments. In the year 1810, before the proceed ings of the Convention were ordered to be published, the Rev. Dr. Mason, intending to write the life of Hamilton, applied to Mr. Madison, then President of the United States, for a copy of that speech, which Avas furnished to him accompanied by the folloAving note : \u2014 \"James Madison presents his respects to Dr. Mason \" with the promised copy of Mr. Hamilton's observations \" in the General Convention on the subject of a Federal \" Constitution, as noted at the time.\" \" AVashington, January \\2th, 1810.\" Dr. Mason abandoned the idea of preparing the life, and a descendant of his, a few years since, placed in my"], [99, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 77 hands two of the documents collected by his grandfather, one of which was the above note with a copy of the speech. The following are extracts from the latter : \u2014 \" This view of the subject almost led him to despair that a republican government could be established over a country of so great an extent. He Avas sensible at the same time that it would be unwise to propose one of any other form. In his private opinion he had no scruple in declaring, supported as he was in the opinion of so many of the wise and the good, that the British government was the best in the world ; and he doubted very much whether any thing short of it would do in America.\" Speaking of the executive, he said : \" As to the exec utive it seemed to be admitted that no good one could be established on republican principles. Was not this giving up the merits of the question, for can there be a good government Avithout a good executive X The English model was the only good one on this subject. The hered itary interest of the king was so interwoven with those of the nation, and his personal emolument so great, that he Avas placed above the danger of being corrupted from abroad,\" &c. Also, \" their House of Lords is a most noble institution. Having nothing to hope for by a change and a sufficient interest by means of their property in being faithful to the national interest, they form a per manent barrier against any pernicious innovation, Avhether attempted on the part of the Crown or of the Commons.\" On comparing these extracts with the speech, as pub lished in the \" Madison Papers,\" I find them to accord in all respects. In the life of Hamilton, by his son, the author indulges in harsh imputation upon the conduct of Mr. Madison, in this connection, in the justice of Avhich I am deceived in the general sentiment of the country if he finds many to agree with him; and through a fatality which"], [100, "78 POLITICAL PARTIES often attends singular demonstrations, he publishes in the same volume Hamilton's plan of government, the original draft of which Dr. Mason informed Mr. Madison was yet among the General's papers, and Avhich is, word for Avord, the same as the copy published in the \"Madison Papers;\" and also Hamilton's own notes for his great speech in the Convention, Avhich indicate the character of the speech upon the point in question as fully as notes ever prefigured a speech, and both of which confirm all that Mr. Madison has said in regard to it. The following are extracts from the notes : \u2014 \" Here I shall give my sentiments of the best form of government \u2014 not as a thing attainable by us, but as a model which we ought to approach as near as possible.\" \"British Constitution best form.\" \"There ought to be a principle in the government capable of resisting the popular current.\" \" No periodical duration Avill come up to this.\" \" The principle chiefly intended to be established is this, that there must be a permanent will.\" \" A democratic assembly is to be checked by a democratic senate, and both these by a democratic chief magistrate : the end will not be answered ; the means will not be equal to the object.\" \" The monarch must have proportional strength. He ought to be hereditary, and to have so much power that it will not be his interest to risk much to acquire more.\" \" The advantage of a monarch is this, he is above corruption, \u2014 he must always intend in respect to foreign nations the true interests and glory of the people.\" \" Republics liable to foreign corruption and intrigue. Holland \u2014 Athens.\" \"Effect of the British government.\" \" A vigorous execution of the laws, and a vigorous de fense of the people will result.\" \" Better chance for a good government.\" \" It is said a republican government will not admit of a vigorous execution.\" \" It is therefore"], [101, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 79 bad ; for the goodness of a government consists in a vig orous execution.\" It thus appears that the opinions avowed to Mr. Jeffer son on different occasions, one of which seems to have been sought for the purpose, were no more than repetitions of those he had avowed on the floor of the Convention, and of which he knew that Mr. Madison possessed an authentic record that would some day see the light ; in deed, if such had not been the fact he would have just as frankly repeated them, for they Avere the settled convictions of his mind during his life \u2014 as fresh when they were announced to Mr. Jefferson as Avhen promulgated in the Convention. Nor had he any motives for concealment of his views, if concealment had been, as it was not, charac teristic of the man, for he was equally convinced that the government which had been established would prove a failure, and that the wisdom of his plans and the pro priety of adopting them would thus become apparent to all. We have here the Avords of General Hamilton himself \u2014 in his declarations deliberately made and attested iu the most solemn and responsible form by Thomas Jefferson, and in his speech as reported by James Madison, under still more specific responsibility, confirmed by his own notes for that speech now published by his son and biog rapher \u2014 all going to the same end, viz : to show that he was in principle a monarchist, and that he preferred a monarchical to a republican form of government. But Jefferson and Madison were politically his oppo nents. Let us now see what his oldest and best friend says upon this point. Gouverneur Morris, his coadjutor in the Convention and in politics through life, and his eulogist at the grave, gave in 1 8 1 1 an unreserved expose of Hamilton's opinions on this very question, in a letter to"], [102, "80 POLITICAL PARTIES Robert Walsh, then editor of the \"National Gazette,\" written, doubtless, in answer to inquiries. The reader should procure this letter, and will find in it much matter of interest. I omit, among other things, Avhat it says in respect to Hamilton's purity, and his frank and honorable character and bearing in political matters, having said as much myself, and with no less sincerity. \" General Hamilton,\" says Morris, \" had little share in forming the Constitution. He disliked it, believing all republican government to be radically defective. He ad mired, nevertheless, the British Constitution, which I con- sider an aristocracy in fact though a monarchy in name. General Hamilton hated republican government because he confounded it Avith democratical government, and he detested the latter because he believed it must end in despotism, aud be, in the mean time, destructive to pub- lic morality But although General Hamilton knew these things from the study of history, and per ceived them by the intuition of genius, he never failed on every occasion to advocate the excellence of, and avow his attachment to monarchical government.\" In another part of the letter, \" one marked trait in the General's character Avas the pertinacious adherence to opinions he had once formed.\" 1 In a previous letter, written shortly after Hamilton's death, (December, 1804,) to Governor Aaron Ogden, Morris says : \" Our poor friend Hamilton bestrode his hobby to the great annoyance of his friends and not Avith out injury to himself. More a theoretic than a practical man, he was not sufficiently convinced that a system may be good in itself and bad in relation to particular circum stances. He well knew that his favorite form Avas inad- missible unless as the result of civil war ; and I suspect 1 Sparks's Life of Gowverneur Morris, Vol. III. p. 260."], [103, "m THE UNITED STATES. 81 that his belief in what he called an approaching crisis1 arose from a conviction that the kind of government most suitable, in his opinion, to this extensive country, could be established in no other way.\" Hamilton not only cherished his preference for monarch ical institutions to the very close of his life, but Ave have good reason to believe that the expectation that some crisis in the affairs of the country, encouraged by the weakness of our political system, would yet arise and would lead to their introduction, was equally abiding. His letters and writings will be found to contain many intimations to that effect. I will notice two instances. His letter to Timothy Pickering in 1803, is the only attempt that I have ever seen, coming from himself, to explain his course in the Convention. There may have been others, but I would be surprised indeed by the production of any thing from his pen denying his preference for the monarchical form of government, although such was the standing charge of his political opponents. None such, I feel very confident, ever existed. That letter concludes with the following very sig nificant remark : \u2014 \" I sincerely hope that it may not hereafter be dis covered that, through want of sufficient attention to the last idea,\" (that of giving adequate energy to the Govern ment,) \" the experiment of Republican GoA'ernment, even in this country, has not been as complete, as satisfactory, and as decisive as could be wished.\" The explanation of \" his conduct, motives, and views \" in accepting the challenge of Colonel Burr \u2014 probably the last paper containing any allusion to public affairs that he ever wrote \u2014 closes with expressions, italicized by myself, remarkably in harmony with the intimations of Gouverneur Morris to Aaron Ogden : \u2014 1 The italics are mine. 6"], [104, "82 POLITICAL PARTIES \" To those who, Avith me, abhorring the practice of duel ing, may think that I ought on no account to add to the number of bad examples, I answer that my relative situation, as well in public as private, enforcing all the considerations which men of the Avorld designate honor, imposed on me, as I thought, a peculiar necessity not to decline the call. The ability to be in future useful, whether in resisting mischief or effecting good, in those crises of our public affairs which seem likely to happen, would probably be inseparable from a conformity ivith prejudice in this particular.\" Although not so pointed in expressing it, his disposition toward the State governments was scarcely more favor able than toward the plan of the general government. In his letter to Pickering, at a period Avhen their useful ness and importance to the system were better appreciated, he says : \" Though I would have enlarged the legislative poAver of the General Government, yet I never contem plated the abolition of the State governments, but, on the contrary, they Avere in some particulars a part, \u2014 constitu ent parts, \u2014 of my plan.\" But let us see what part it was that he would have them perform. He said in the Conven tion : \"If they (the State governments) are extinguished, he A\\ras persuaded that great economy might be obtained by substituting a general government. He did not mean, however, to shock the public opinion by proposing such a measure. On the other hand, he saw no other necessity for declining it. They are not necessary for any of the great purposes of commerce, revenue, or agriculture. Subordinate authorities, he was aware, would be necessary. There must be district tribunals, corporations for local purposes. But cut bono the vast and expensive apparatus now appertaining to the States % \" These were Hamilton's views in respect to the State"], [105, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 83 governments, as expressed in the Convention, according to Mr. Madison's report. In this case it is also fortunate for the cause of truth that, from a paper written by Hamilton just as the General Convention adjourned, and published by his son, it appears very plainly that his views upon the subject cannot have been greatly misreported by Mr. Madison. Iu this paper he speculates upon the probable fate of the Constitution ; after saying, in confirmation of my suggestion that he doubted the dispositions of the people in other respects than their intelligence and capacity, that the Constitution Avould have in its favor \" the s*ood will of men of property in the several States who Avish a government of the Union able to protect them against domestic violence, and the depredations which the demo cratic spirit is apt to make on property\" he adds : \" If the Government be adopted, it is probable General Wash ington will be the President of the United States. This Avill insure a wise choice of men to administer the Govern ment, and a good administration. A good administration Avill conciliate the confidence and affection of the people, and perhaps enable the Government to acquire more con sistency than the proposed Constitution seems to promise for so great a country. It may then triumph over the State governments and reduce them to entire subordination, dividing the larger States into smaller districts. The organs of the General Government may also acquire addi tional strength.\" The italics in the above extracts are all my own except as to the word organs. He Avould not \" shock the public opinion \" by proposing to extinguish the State governments, but there was no other reason for omit ting to do so. It would be well if it Avere done, but it Avas not Avise to shock the public mind upon a point in resiiect to Avhich it was known to be sensitive. But he would reduce them to entire subordination, triumph over"], [106, "84 POLITICAL PARTIES and consequently humiliate them. It would be a poor compliment to Hamilton's knowledge of men and of the effect of public measures, to assume that he did not know that such would be the surest as Avell as the safest way to extinguish them in the end. In a letter to Gouverneur Morris, so late as in 1S02, a little more than two years before his death, and which will be found in \" The Works of Hamilton,\" edited by his son, (Vol. VI. p. 529-) he thus unbosoms himself to his friend : \" Mine is an odd destiny. Perhaps no man in the United States has sacrificed or done more for the present Consti tution than myself; and contrary to all my anticipations of its fate, as you know from the very beginning, I am still laboring to prop the frail and Avorthless fabric. Yet I have the murmurs of its friends no less than the curses of its foes for my reward. What can I do better than withdraw from the scene 1 Every day proves to me more and more that this American Avorld was not made for me.\" There Avould seem to be no force in evidence, hoAvever appropriate its source or credible its character, if that we have produced is not conclusive in regard to the opinions of General Hamilton upon certain points. It proves, first, that he regarded monarchical institutions, according- to the English model, as being the most perfect government that ever existed ; secondly, that he Avould have preferred the establishment of such a government here, and AA-as only prevented from advocating it by a conviction that it Avas made impracticable by the adverse public opinion of the time; thirdly, that he thought it was our duty, never theless, to approach that model with our Government as nearly as the prejudices of the people would permit, and that he introduced into the Convention a plan by Avhich that object might be reached ; fourthly, that he regarded"], [107, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 85 the present Federal Constitution, which, as lately as two years before his death, in a free communication to his trusted friend, he called \" a frail and worthless fabric,\" as inadequate to the purposes of a good government ; that he had accepted it at the time as a temporary bond of union, but believed from the beginning that it would prove a failure and fall into contempt ; that he believed that this result would open the way to popular tumults forcing intervention, and to convulsions through the evils of which the people would, at no distant day, become convinced of their error, and consent to institutions substantially similar to those he favored ; and, fifthly, that his preference for monarchical institutions Avas a fixed and cherished senti ment ; that although at times encouraged by his success in measures he had no right to hope for under the Consti tution as he knew that instrument was intended to be, he yet invariably returned to his first opinion adverse to the sufficiency of the Constitution, and descended to the grave not only without a change in his opinions, but with in creased convictions of their perfect soundness. It has been a question often mooted whether the idea of using the power with which he was or might be clothed to overthrow the actual government, and to introduce the system he so earnestly preferred, Avas ever seriously enter tained by Hamilton. Such designs were freely charged upon him by many of the old Republicans, Avho, under the full influence of partisan prejudices, doubtless believed that he Avaited only for a fit opportunity to attempt them. His repeated and undisguised expressions of a preference for monarchical institutions, to friends and foes, when the people of the United States, whose officer he was, had established a government which they intended should be so widely different from such institutions, Avere well calculated to engender the suspicion. Plain men naturally imagined"], [108, "86 POLITICAL PARTIES that a man like Hamilton Avould do much and incur high responsibilities for the accomplishment of an object so near his heart. Mr. Jefferson, who was not a man of a sus picious temperament, through the fiery and protracted con tests of parties, at the head of which they respectively stood, was evidently at times alarmed by similar apprehen sions. But toward the close of his life, when partisan asperities had been long since forgotten, in a letter to myself he virtually exonerated Hamilton from the charge in these expressions : \u2014 \" For Hamilton frankly avowed that he considered the British Constitution, with all the corruptions of its administration, as the most perfect model of government that had ever been devised by the wit of man, \u2014 professing, howeA'er, at the same time, that the spirit of this country was so fundamentally republican that it would be visionary to think of introducing monarchy here, and that therefore it was the duty of its adminis trators to conduct it upon the principles their constituents had elected.\" 1 Mr. Charles Francis Adams has placed before us, in his life of his grandfather, John Adams, a series of facts bear ing upon this point with no ordinary significance. They are not brought forward in support of any such charge, but as raising a question for the consideration of his read ers, Avhether it is not possible that in the pains he took to increase greatly the provisional forces authorized to meet our difficulties with France, and to convert the Avhole into a permanent military establishment ; in the readiness with which he fell in with the scheme of Miranda, to conquer, through the joint operations of Great Britain and the Unit ed States, the Floridas, Louisiana, and the South Ameri can possessions of Spain, in case of a rupture betAveen us and France ; and in his prompt consent to take command 1 See Appendix."], [109, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 87 of the troops to be so employed, General Hamilton was influenced by a desire to bring about the crisis to which he had always looked as one that would present a fit oppor tunity for the establishment here of the political institutions he preferred. These are grave matters, and of a nature calculated to challenge a new and stricter examination of one of those critical periods which have often occurred in our history, and from which we have had so many providential deliver ances. The subject is treated with becoming delicacy and great caution by the author, whose conclusion, of which we have only a hint, may possibly have been influenced by family traditions, tinctured unavoidably Avith strong per sonal prejudices but never wanting in intelligence. I will not undertake to speculate even as to what General Hamil ton might haA'e done or have left undone if he had found himself at the head of a large and permanent military force, and the country convulsed by those popular outbreaks, the expectation of which seems to have been never absent from his mind or from the minds of his disciples. He might have mounted his \"hobby\" \u2014 as Morris termed his passion for monarchical institutions \u2014 and have struck a blow in their behalf, acting in the spirit of other \"strong minds \" Avho, as Mr. C. F. Adams well and truly says, \" seldom fail to associate Avith dreams of their own glory the modes of exercising power for the good of their fellow men. Considering their happiness as mainly dependent upon a sense of security from domestic convulsions, his first aim Avould have been to gain that end at any rate, even if it should be done at some expense of their liber ties.\" But looking at the subject Avith no other feeling than a sincere desire to arrive at a correct solution of the circumstances narrated by Mr. Adams, I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion referred to."], [110, "POLITICAL PARTIES 88 I can Avell conceive that Hamilton might have been led to avail himself of such a state of things for a coup de main of some decided character if its existence had been brought about by others, or had been the result of for tuitous circumstances \u2014 a contingency which his mind had doubtless often contemplated. But I do not think that he would have planned or contributed to bring about such a state of things involving to so grave an extent the public order and the peace of the country. Such a course would have been at variance with some of his most cherished principles and inconsistent with his personal character. The preservation of order, and a respect for the individual rights of persons and of property, appeared always to be the objects of his greatest solicitude. It was only because he did not think that these could be effectually secured under any other form of government that he preferred monarchical institutions, acknowledging at the same time that they Avere at war with the principles of natural jus tice, and only allowable upon that of their absolute neces sity to secure society against the occasional Avaywardness of a majority of its members. It Avas mainly because of the very erroneous opinions he had formed of the disposi tions in this respect of a majority of his adopted country men that he Avas induced to devote his splendid talents to hopeless efforts to sustain principles so irreconcilable with those for which he had periled his life in the Avar of the Revolution. I say erroneous, not only because I think them such, but because experience, the only unerring test, has so proved them. We are, at the moment Avhen I write, a half century from the transactions which form the subject of our consideration, and I venture nothing in saying that there is no country in Europe in A\\-hich order has, in the interim, been better preserved, or the rights of persons and property been more secure, than in the United States; none"], [111, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 89 in which the power of government has been more stable or more adequate to the purposes of its institution. But this is a Avide field, for Avhich I have neither space nor time. It becomes me to remember, whilst occupied not Avithout pleasure with these retrospective investigations and meditations, that I have already passed by se\\'eral cheerful years, the allotted threescore -and -ten, \u2014 that period of such solemn import which the undeserved favor of an always kind Providence has permitted me to pass, uot only with life but with the means and the faculties to enjoy life, \u2014 .and that if I hope to complete the work before me I must confine myself more to the highway of my sub ject, and leave its by-paths to the explorations of younger men. I cannot, nevertheless, refrain from a brief reference to transactions which have more than once occurred in this country, have made a greater impression on my mind than they seem to have made on others, and which I think have a strong bearing upon the question of the American love of order and respect for property and its rights. Although it is not probable that the facts of these can ever be suffi ciently understood abroad to be correctly appreciated, it is otherwise here, and they are Avell worthy of our profoundest meditations. I allude to scenes which have been presented at San Francisco, which \\Arere at the moment of such thrill ing interest, but appear already to have sunk into oblivion amid the ceaseless bustle and never-halting progress of American life. Look at that young but already large and flourishing city ! Regard her as she stood at the commencement of the extraordinary steps that were taken for her relief!

There is no good reason for saying that during the whole of that period and in the midst of such stirring scenes the power of the Committee Avas in a single instance exercised to divest any innocent man of his property, or to oppress him in any way, or to interfere with his legal rights further than to compel submission to the temporary su premacy of that body, or to punish the innocent, or to enable the guilty to escape, or to aggrandize the Com mittee, or to benefit its members, their friends, or its em ployees, or to do an act of intentional injustice to any human being.

Is it probable that there is any city in Europe of equal size in which its legally established authorities could have been suspended by the irregular action of its own people with similar results, \u2014 in which the substituted power could be exercised with equal Avisdom and forbearance, aud laid down with so few causes for individual complaint ?

The remedy for the social and political crimes which called the Committee of Vigilance into existence was a fearful one, and must be so regarded by all thinking and virtuous minds, and it would seem paradoxical to set up such a crowning act of disorder \u2014 that of the subversion of all legal authority, for even the shortest period \u2014 as an exhibition of a love of order and respect for the rights of persons and of property on the part of the actors ; but I cannot resist the belief that the transaction afforded the strongest proof of the existence of those great principles in their minds, and that a proper sense of them and a determination to maintain them will seldom be wanting on the part of those who can act as did the Committee of San Francisco and its supporters. But I ask pardon for this digression, and return to my subject. Many considerations besides those suggested by Hamilton's invariable solicitude for the preservation of order aud by his constant respect for the individual rights of persons and of property, press themselves upon my mind against the conclusion intimated by Mr. C. F. Adams, and against the probability that General Hamilton ever con templated the creation of a state of things that Avould justify or facilitate the employment of force to establish institutions more congenial with his taste and judgment than those Ave possessed. But I forbear to urge them, partly because I have devoted as much time and space to the subject as I can afford, and also because I am well satisfied that his knowledge of the certain opposition of General Washington to any such scheme or design Avould have been sufficient to deter him from undertaking either"], [115, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 93 during the lifetime of the General,even if his own disposi tion had pointed in that direction. It was at no time the intention of President Washington to give his sanction to the opinions so generally, and as it now appears so justly, attributed to General Hamilton. Never Avas man more strongly pledged to the support of republican 'government, or more unchangeably determined to maintain the responsibilities he had incurred in that regard. Embracing Avith all his heart the Declaration of Independence, in Avhich its principles were delineated with the pencil of truth, he did more than any other man to overthrow the government against which it Avas hurled, and to open the Avay for the establishment of a republic in its place. None knew better than he that such was the object of the Revolution, and his resolution was immov able that the sufferings and sacrifices which had been in curred in support of that object should not fail to accom plish it through any act of omission or commission on his part. Every important act in his eventful career shows that he regarded himself on that point as invested by his country with a sacred trust. When the bright prospect Avhich he had largely contributed to open to his countrymen for the realization of their Avishes in this respect was in danger of being obscured, if not forever blasted, by means similar to those which have so often prevented or subverted free government, by the violence of an exasperated soldiery, he threw himself into the breach, and saved at the same time by his heroic and patriotic effort their interests and the honor of his brothers-in-arms. When the minds of the earnest and jealous friends of liberty \\A-ere frenzied by an ill-advised attempt in the same quarter to introduce hereditary distinctions amongst us, he Avas again found at the post of duty ; and, though feelingly indulgent to his military companions, as Avell as satisfied of the perfect"], [116, "94 POLITICAL PARTIES purity of their intentions, he nevertheless promptly and successfully employed the great influence he derived from their respect for his character and their confidence in his friendship to induce them to abandon their project. In the full possession of such claims to the esteem, gratitude, and trust of his countrymen, superadded to those which were due for his military services, he closed the first great period of his splendid life by presiding over the Federal Convention, and by assenting to, and recommend- ing to the favor of the people, a Constitution eminently republican in its form, and in the principles upon Avhich it Avas founded. So far Avas he from encouraging the spread of opposite sentiments that there is, on the contrary, much reason to believe that it Avas by making his views of the subject known to those about him that the anti-republican tone which Jefferson found, on his arrival from France, so prevalent in social and political circles at the seat of gov- ernment, was kept in check until public opinion became strong enough to extinguish it altogether. Speaking to this point, Mr. Jefferson says, \" The truth is that the Fed- eralists, pretending to be the exclusive friends of General Washington, have ever done Avhat they could to sink his character by hanging theirs on it, and by representing as the enemy of Republicans, him Avho of all men is best enti- tled to the appellation of the father of that Republic Avhich they Avere endeavoring to subvert, and the Republicans to maintain. They cannot deny, because the elections pro- claimed the truth, that the great body of the nation ap- proved the republican measures. General Washington Avas himself sincerely a friend to the republican principles of the Constitution. His faith perhaps in its duration might not have been as confident as mine ; but he repeat edly declared to me that he was determined it should have a fair chance of success, and that he would lose the last"], [117, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 95 drop of his blood in its support against any attempt Avhich might be made to change it from its republican form. He made these declarations the oftener because he knew my suspicions that Hamilton had other views, and he wished to quiet my jealousies upon the subject.\" 1 Independently of his principles, which were the main source, doubtless, of the personal solicitude he often mani fested upon this point, General Washington was a man of too much sense and reflection not to know that the world Avould in all future time hold him responsible for the over throw of the republican principle here, if its extinguish ment occurred in his day, and he AA-as too careful of his well-earned fame, and anticipated too correctly the elevation it was destined to reach in connection with the history of his country, not to do all in his power to guard it from detriment upon a point at once so delicate and so momen tous. Hamilton Avas the first man to Avhom he Avould make his sentiments known, and I can find nothing in the positions Avhich they occupied toward each other which would induce me to entertain the opinion that Hamilton would have ventured on an attempt to shake his patriotic resolutions on that point through the influence he was sup posed to possess over the actions of Washington in other respects. There is, I am quite sure, nothing more essential to a right appreciation of many of the most important incidents in our political history, than a correct understanding of the relations that existed between those distinguished men. It cannot fail to shed considerable light on much that occurred during the government of the Confederation, and is per haps the only touchstone by which the measures of govern ment and many other public transactions between 1789 and 1799 \u2014 between the organization of the new gov- l See Appendix."], [118, "96 POLITICAL PARTIES ernment and the death of Washington \u2014 can be safely tested. I will give my interpretation of the character of those relations, fully aware of the misrepresentations and misun derstandings to Avhich they haA'e been subjected, and from which no subject connected with partisan conflicts can, it appears, be entirely free, but conscious of a single desire to state things truly, and of an inability to do intentional injustice to either. It will be for others to judge of my success. Mr. Charles F. Adams, in the work to which I have referred,1 says, \"Without much hold upon the judgment or affections of the people at large, he (Hamilton) had yet by the effect of his undisputed abilities and his masculine will gained great sway over the minds of the intelligent mer chants along the Atlantic border. His previous doctrines, in unison with the feelings and interests of the most con servative class, had drawn to him their particular confi dence, whilst his position in the first administration had facilitated the establishment by him of a chain of influence resting for its main support on his power over the mind of Washington himself but carried equally through all the ramifications of the executive department. Thus it hap pened that even after he ceased to be personally present his opinions continued to shape the policy of Washington's second administration, and even that of his successor\" This declaration extending so far Avould have been deemed quite credible at the period to which it relates, and, comino from the grandson of that \" successor\" \u2014 himself the undis guised enemy of Hamilton \u2014 Avas probably called forth by the recent publication of the private papers of the latter. As far as Mr. Adams affirms that the policy of Wash ington's administration, and also, in many very important 1 Life of John Adams.

General Hamilton Avas his beau ideal of a politician and statesman, and it Avould not have been an easy matter in him to have dissented from any opinion positively advanced by Hamilton. Avhatever his own first impressions on the subject might have been. Mr. McHenry, Secretary of War in both cabinets, was undoubtedly an honorable and well-disposed gentleman. He was, in the opinion of those who had the best opportunities for judging, including Washington and Hamilton, not entirely competent for the duties of his office, and that circumstance drove him the more to rely for support on Hamilton, for whom he cher ished an early and ardent friendship. His personal devotion to Hamilton was such as to prevent Mr. Adams from longer overlooking his incompetency, as Washington had done, and precipitated his resignation. Oliver Wolcott, Secretary of the Treasury, the member of his cabinet most trusted by President Adams because the least suspected, was, notwithstanding, the one among his official advisers Avho Avent the greatest lengths to testify his entire alle giance to Hamilton, who had been the artificer of his political fortunes from the beginning and by Avhose influ ence he had been advanced to the high position he occupied. Throughout he advised with and Avas assisted by Hamilton in the performance of his official duties. Such was Ham ilton's \" poAver over his mind \" that he was applied to suc cessfully by the former for evidence of facts to be derived from the treasury archives to sustain an attack that Hamil ton contemplated making upon the President \u2014 an attack that he did make, although he acknoAvledged to Wolcott that it would not be regarded as proper that he should haA'e received the evidence at his hands, and that that fact ouo-ht not therefore to be knoAvn."], [121, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 99 No one can read the correspondence between General Hamilton and Mr. Wolcott, as recently published with Hamilton's Works, Avithout regretting that the parties to it should have been so forgetful of the proprieties due to the occasions to which it relates, or without a disposition to excuse the strong expression of Mr. Charles F. Adams, in speaking of his grandfather's cabinet, applied to Mr. Wolcott \" as the most venomous serpent of them all.\" Mr. Charles F. Adams places Hamilton's sway over the mind of Washington upon the same footing Avith that which he exerted over the executive department, composed principally of the members of his second cabinet of whom we have been speaking. From this view I entirely dissent. If Hamilton possessed any power over the mind of Wash ington, it A\\as of a very different character from that Avhich he exercised over those members. Washington was to an unusual extent free from the weakness of overrating his own powers ; Avith just conceptions of his capacities for public service he was always ready to place them at the public disposal, but he Avas very far from pretending to qualifications Avhich he did not possess. No one Avas more sensible than he that the science of civil government \u2014 the construction of constitutions and the administration of the civil affairs of the State \u2014 were not best learned in the camp, Avhere so large a portion of his life had been spent. He therefore, as we have seen, selected two of the ablest statesmen in the country, particularly versed in those portions of the public business Avhich he devolved upon them. They differed irreconcilably in respect to the policy of the administration, and in the performance of his duty he decided between their conflicting opinions in favor of those of Hamilton. Preferring the policy of the latter he adopted the measures he recommended to carry it out, which happened also to appertain principally to Hamilton s"], [122, "100 POLITICAL PARTIES department, and sustained him in their execution. In doing so he but sustained the measures of his administra tion and views Avhich were either originally his OAvn or made such upon conviction. Participating in the general opinion in favor of Hamilton's remarkable talents, having full opportunities to judge of his character, and confiding in his integrity, he extended to him, it is true, but Avith the purest motives, the degree of countenance and trust which established his extraordinary power and influence. Of the consequences, as well to his administration as to the country, Ave will haA-e much to say hereafter. But it Avould be a great mistake to suppose that there ever Avas a period at Avhich, or a transaction betsveen them in which, their relative positions, rights, and duties were either for gotten or disregarded. It was well understood that the degree of Aveight to be attached to Hamilton's advice would depend upon the unbiased opinion Avhich Washing ton himself should form of its soundness, influenced as he naturally Avould be, and always was, by a conviction of Hamilton's undoubted integrity, and his superior capacity for the decision of the question under consideration. There certainly never AA'as a time Avhen the slightest in dication of a desire or design on the part of Hamilton to sway the mind of Washington in his official acts through his personal influence, or by any considerations which did not point distinctly and exclusively to the public good, would not have been peremptorily and indignantly repelled. It is evident from the whole tenor of Washington's life that no man ever lived Avho was more tenacious of self respect, or more absolute in his reservation of the rio-ht to judge for himself of Avhat belonged to his individual independence and personal dignity, or more prompt to resist every attempt to encroach upon either. No one understood his temperament in that respect better than"], [123, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 101 General Hamilton, or would have been less likely to bring himself in conflict Avith it. Many indications of this un derstanding and of its effects are to be found in the ac counts of their personal intercourse. The correspondence between them in regard to the discreditable use that Washington thought Avas being made in Congress of the sufferings and dissatisfaction of the army, already referred to, will be found to throw much light upon the sense of both as to the nature of their personal relations. In June, 1793, Hamilton announced to President Wash ington, that considerations relative both to the public interest and his own dignity had brought his mind to the conclusion to resign his office at the termination of the close of the next session of Congress, and one of the reasons he assigned for delaying his final retirement to that period was to give Congress an opportunity to com plete the investigation that had been instituted in regard to his official conduct. In March thereafter Hamilton informed the President that the committee charged to inquire, among other things, \" into the authority of the President respecting the making and disbursement of the loans under certain acts of Congress,\" were about to meet. He seut to him at the same time, a copy of a paper he had presented to the committee, containing his opinion in re lation to the proper limits of a legislative inquiry, but said that he deemed it expedient to fix in advance, Avith the President, on the true state of facts, of which he pro ceeded to make a statement, and requested the Presi dent to sanction it. General Washington soon thereafter made a declaration, in the form of a letter to Hamilton, of his recollections and opinions in respect to the matter. The latter, in reply, protested vehemently against the suf ficiency of the declaration for the protection of his honor, and in a letter of considerable length, written Avith his"], [124, "102 POLITICAL PARTIES usual ability, undertook to show that the character of the President's declaration would enable his (Hamilton's) ene mies to say that \" the reserve of the President is a proof that he does not think that Hamilton's representations are true, else his justice Avould have led him to rescue the officer concerned even from suspicion upon the point.' The subject of loans and their frequency produced much excitement in Congress, and not a feAV calls upon the President and the Secretary of the Treasury for infor mation in regard to them. It does not appear from the published Avorks of Hamilton, that any answer was made by General Washington to his letter, or any other explana tion of the subject ; and no one, I think, can read the cor respondence without feeling that the interpretation I give to its abrupt termination is the correct one, viz. : that Washington intended by his silence to reprove the freedom of Hamilton's letter. The resignation of the latter was deferred, with the approbation of the President, till Jan uary, 1795, when it was accepted in a letter from General Washington, containing an approval of Hamilton's official conduct as full as words could make it.1 The construction I have placed upon the character of their personal relations is also sustained by a correspond ence between them in May, 1798, after Hamilton's retire ment from office, which will be found in the sixth volume of Hamilton's \" Works,\" at p. 289. Hamilton's object appears to have been to impress the mind of Washing ton with a proper sense of the dangerous crisis which had arrived in the condition of public affairs. His letter contains the following extraordinary paragraph : \" I am sincere in declaring my full conviction, as the result of a long course of observation, that the faction Avhich has for J Hamilton's Works, Vol. IV. pp. 436, 510, 516, 562 ; Vol. V. pp. 74, 78 . rv"], [125, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 103 years opposed the government are ready to remodel our Constitution under the influence or coercion of France, to form Avith her a perpetual alliance, offensive and defensive, and to give her a monopoly of our trade, by peculiar and exclusive privileges. This Avould be in substance, Avhat eA'er it might be in name, to make this country a province of France. Neither do I doubt that her standard dis played in this country would be directly or indirectly sec onded by them in pursuance of the project I have men tioned.\" In such a state of things it Avas impossible, he said, not to look up to him, (Washington,) and to wish that his in fluence might, in some proper way, be brought into direct action, and he added : \" Among the ideas that have passed through my mind for this purpose, I have asked myself whether it might not be expedient for you to make a cir cuit through Virginia and North Carolina under some pretense of health, &c. This would call forth addresses, public dinners, &c, which would give an opportunity of expressing sentiments in ansAA'ers, toasts, &c, which Avould throw the weight of your character into the scale of the government, and revive enthusiasm for your person Avhich might be turned into the right channel.\" Although Washington himself had been highly excited, by the course of events, against those to Avhom Hamilton attributed such treasonable designs, he A\\-as yet enabled by his good sense and by his knowledge of his countrymen to see at a glance the reckless extravagance of Hamilton's imputations, and he was doubtless dissatisfied with the uses, little creditable, which it was proposed to make of himself. His answer was a truly imposing production. It narrowed Hamilton's description of the portions of his countrymen whose course he deemed objectionable, vir tually disapproved his charges by giving his OAvn views of"], [126, "104 POLITICAL PARTIES the extent of the danger Avhich was to be apprehended from those Avhose patriotism Hamilton so grossly im peached, and placed the objectionable character of the course recommended to him in a striking light by showing that, his health never having been better, he Avould be obliged to commence his journey with the propagation of a falsehood. Those who Avish to read these letters will do Avell to look for them in Hamilton's \" Works,\" as I am sorry to say that in Mr. Sparks's \" Writings of Washington \" the above extract from Hamilton's letter, containing his sug gestion of an electioneering tour in the South by Wash ington, is omitted, and the whole paragraph in Washing ton's reply, in which he rejects and virtually rebukes it, suppressed. Neither is that part of Hamilton's letter given in which he denounces \" the powerful faction Avhich has for years opposed the government \" Avith fanatical violence, (for his description of them deserves no other name,) whilst Avhat Washington says upon that point is set forth Avith considerable aggravation. The results of those omissions and suppressions are not only to conceal the fact that such a proposition was made to Washington, and the grounds upon which he declined to adopt it, but his remarks, condemnatory of a portion of his felloAv-citi zens, are left to stand as voluntary denunciations of his own instead of, as they in truth were, modifications of the charges to Avhich Hamilton had called his attention. I have thus selected a few transactions between these great men, occurring at long intervals and embracing the entire period of their intercourse, to sIioav that the influ ence Avhich it must be conceded Hamilton exercised over Washington's conduct in the civil service of his country was not of the character which is commonly understood and intended by the imputation of it in the case of hio-h"], [127, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 105 official personages, and which necessarily involves the sacri fice of personal independence and, at least in some degree, of self-respect on the part of the person influenced. Anecdotes of distinguished men are always interesting, although their accuracy is not so reliable, of course, as that of statements substantiated by their own Avritings. I Avas told of one, several years since, Avhich struck me as throwing light upon this subject of the personal relations between Washington and his immediate associates and friends. So thinking, and especially as General Hamilton was in one sense a party concerned, I have recently ob tained reliable testimony of its authenticity. Judge Fine, the writer of the following note, is Avell known in New York, and not a little in other States ; he has been a State Senator, a Representative in Congress, a State Judge, &c, &c, and is regarded as a gentleman of the utmost probity and of superior intelligence. Judge Burnet, with Avhom I have served in the United States Senate, Avas also Avell known as a gentleman in whose statements entire confi dence might be placed, and AA'as, withal, a Hamiltouian Fed eralist, and never, politically, any thing else; in Avhose eyes, I am very sure, any statement disparaging to the memory of either Washington or Hamilton would have appeared a grave offense against morality and truth. FROM JOHN FINE. Ogdensburg, N. Y., April 30, 1857. Hon. M. Van Buren : Dear Sir, \u2014 During the session of the Presbyterian General Assembly in Cincinnati \u2014 May, 1852 \u2014 I dined twice at the hospitable mansion of Hon. Jacob Burnet, noAV deceased. He was born in NeAvark, NeAv Jersey, in 1770, aud was the son of Dr. William Burnet, Avho Avas in the medical service of his country through the Revo lution."], [128, "106 POLITICAL PARTIES Judge Burnet Avas acquainted Avith our early distin guished statesmen, and his conversation was rich in the recollection of their manners and characters. He related an anecdote of Washington which he had from the lips of Alexander Hamilton. When the Convention to form a Constitution Avas sitting in Philadelphia in 1787, of which General Washington Avas President, he had stated evenings to receive the calls of his friends. At an interview between Hamilton, the Morrises, and others, the former remarked that Washing ton was reserved and aristocratic even to his intimate friends, and allowed no one to be familiar Avith him. Gouverneur Morris said that Avas a mere fancy, and he could be as familiar with Washington as Avith any of his other friends. Hamilton replied, \" If you will, at the next reception evening, gently slap him on the shoulder and say, ' My dear General, how happy I am to see you look so well ! ' a supper and Avine shall be provided for you and a dozen of your friends.\" The challenge was accepted. On the evening appointed a large number attended, and at an early hour Gouverneur Morris entered, bowed, shook hands, laid his left hand on Washington's shoulder, and said: \"My dear General, I am very happy to see you look so well ! \" Washington withdrew his hand, stepped suddenly back, fixed his eye on Morris for several minutes with an angry frown, until the latter retreated abashed and sought refuge in the crowd. The company looked on in silence. At the supper Avhich was provided by Hamilton, Morris said : \" I have won the bet but paid dearly for it, and nothing could induce me to repeat it.\" Yours truly, JOHN FINE."], [129, "4 IN THE UNITED STATES. 107 Better proof of the truth of this statement could not, at this day, be expected or desired, and assuming it to be substantially true, the transaction, in my estimation, illus trates the character of the personal relations that existed between Washington and the two distinguished men, Hamilton and Morris, who, in respect to the management of public affairs, enjoyed perhaps his fullest confidence. It is Avithout doubt true, that in his intercourse Avith public men Washington observed an extraordinary degree of dignified reserve, and there is every reason to believe that this invariable habit Avas natural to him, and in no degree assumed for effect. We indeed know nothing of his character if he Avas at all capable of practicing the Ioav device of hiding mental deficiencies under a Avise look and a mysterious manner, Avhich is sometimes the resort of meaner minds ; but some such foundation (or some degree of it) for his habit must have been presupposed by the very unusual proceeding of Morris and it is quite impos sible to believe that a man was in danger of being unduly influenced by his personal friends who could thus, by the power of his eye and the solemnity of his countenance, abash and punish the presumption of a man of Morris's standing, confessedly the sauciest man in his society, with out causing the slightest confusion or excitement in the surrounding company. He had nothing to conceal ; he never desired to pass for more than he was worth, and there have been few men Avho formed a juster estimate of their own qualifications and capacities. In respect to military affairs he was evi dently self-reliant, but not more so than Avas justified by his large experience and by the success which had crowned his efforts ; but neither in that nor in any other depart ment was he above receiving advice. In the intricate and complex affairs of civil administration, and in grave ques-"], [130, "108 POLITICAL PARTIES tions of constitutional construction and of national law, he felt that his experience and study had been much less than those of some who A\\-ere associated Avith him in the public service, and he did not hesitate to recognize the difference. The principal aid he could bring to the settle ment of such questions consisted of a clear head, a sound judgment, and an honest heart. These he never failed to apply after such questions had been prepared for decision by the previous examination and discussions of those of his cabinet whose attention had been more directed to them than his own. To secure these prerequisites he had, as I have said before, availed himself of the highest talent which the country afforded, without reference to distinctions of party. This Avas the Avay in which he dealt with the grave questions that arose during the early stages of his admin istration, touching the numerous and complicated difficul ties between us and our old friend and ally France, the reception and treatment of her ministers, Genet and his successor Adet, our assumption of a neutral position be tween European belligerents, the claims of France under the treaty of alliance and guaranty, the powers of Congress under the Constitution in relation to a national bank, and other subjects. In respect to the first of these matters he went so far as to consult Hamilton by letter on the question of his own personal demeanor at a Presidential levee toward the French minister, by whose conduct he had been offended. Whatever may be our regret at finding the confidential note asking that advice preserved to so late a period and now recklessly published, we may yet be satis fied that the step itself only affords additional evidence of the prudence and manliness of Washington's character. Few men stood less in need of advice in respect to his treatment of those Avho had given him offense in a matter"], [131, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 109 purely personal ; but it Avas natural for him to assume that the usages of diplomacy had settled rules for the action of the heads of government in such cases, of Avhich he was not informed and in respect to which he Avas not ashamed to ask advice arid information from proper sources. The constancy with which he invoked the aid of his cabinet upon all questions of the general character to which I have alluded, the unreserved manner in which he submitted them to their consideration, the delicacy with which he withheld his opinions until theirs Avere pronounced, and the spirit in Avhich these were received, whether agreeing with or differing from his own, were above all praise. The information Ave possess of the details of those interesting proceedings is principally derived from Mr. Jefferson, and in all that he has written or in all that we have understood him to have said upon the subject no Avord of complaint or allegation at variance with the description here given of them is to be found. The idea that Washington ever sought to advance his objects by indirect or exceptionable means, or that he was actuated in his public measures by any other motive than an honest desire to promote the good of his country, seems never to have presented it self to Mr. Jefferson's mind, however erroneous he con sidered some of those measures. I spent some days with him, as I have elsewhere described,1 two years before his death, and in the course of our repeated conversations he dwelt long and particularly upon these early transactions. I attributed the circumstance at the time to a desire, con sistent Avith his very genial disposition, to gratify my curiosity, which Avas strong and not concealed ; and it did not occur to me that he might have had other views, until, after my return home, I received his long letter avowedly written for the purpose for Avhich I now use it, \" to throw light on history, and to recall that into the path of truth 1 See Note on page 9."], [132, "110 POLITICAL PARTIES when he was no more, nor those whom it might offend.\" In all that he said \u2014 and he spoke Avith perfect freedom of men and things \u2014 there was nothing inconsistent Avith the inference I have here drawn from his Avritings, but much to confirm it. The President's decisions upon cabinet questions Avere generally in favor of Hamilton's views; hut that circumstance, very much to his credit, Avas not permitted to influence Jefferson's estimate of motives, but Avas regarded as the natural result of Washington's gen eral sympathy Avith Hamilton's political opinions, and his confidence in his ability and integrity, \u2014 a sympathy, how ever, that never even approached the subject of a chauge in the existing form of our Government. That Avas a question as to which Ave have the best reason to believe that Washington would have never taken counsel except from his God and his conscience. He more than once declared to Jefferson \" that he Avas determined that the republican form of our Government should haA'e a fair chance of success, and that he would, if necessary, spill the last drop of his blood in its defense,\" \u2014 a resolution, and the likelihood of its being sustained, that no one un derstood better than Hamilton. By these repeated declarations to Mr. Jefferson, Wash ington only renewed to a civilian, Avhose character and position made them the more significant and impressive, a pledge Avhich he had given to the AA-orld at Newburgh in the presence of the companions of his glory, yet Avith arms in their hands \u2014 that his name should never be added to the list of those who, having done much to emancipate a people from thralldom, were the first to blast their hopes and sacrifice their dearest interests at the promptino-s of selfish and unhallowed passions. They only proved that the flattery of the world during the ten intervening years had not corrupted his heart nor endangered the observance"], [133, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 111 of a pledge which had derived its value from the character of the man who gave it, and on whose continued fidelity to the principle it involved the future liberties and welfare of his country were in so large a degree dependent. It has always been believed that if Washington had inclined a favorable ear to the suggestions of the New burgh letters, and in due season had given his name and influence to the counter-revolution they were intended to promote, it might have been made successful, and the sys tem which the Revolution had overthrown might have been in some modified form restored. The disparity between the means which Avere at his disposal when propositions looking to such a result AA'ere thrown before the army at Newburgh and those within his reach Avhen the declara tions to Mr. Jefferson were made Avas not as great as might be supposed. At the former period it is true that the army of the Revolution Avas yet in the field, mortified, irritated, and indeed highly inflamed by the assumed injus tice and ingratitude of their country, and in all probability prepared to folloAV his lead in furtherance of any vieAVs he might disclose Avhich did not exceed the proposed limits ; and the government to be overthrown was feeble, dis tracted, destitute of the sinews of Avar, and Avith but a slight hold upon the confidence and affections of the people. But it must also be remembered that the fervor and spirit of the Revolution \u2014 that intense hatred of royalty and monarchical institutions in any shape \u2014 which had roused the country to the contest, had as yet in no sensible degree abated amongst the masses, neither had they surrendered those sanguine anticipations of the blessings and advan tages of republican government by Avhich their hearts had been fortified and their arms strengthened for the struggle. That any attempt to bring about a counter-revolution under such circumstances, however popular the name and char-"], [134, "112 POLITICAL PARTIES acter of him by whom it was sanctioned, or however im posing the means by which it Avas sustained, would meet Avith a formidable opposition from the great body of the people Avas certain ; and it was not easy to estimate the nature and extent of the resistance that might spring from the sources to which I have referred to confront an army Avhich had so lately been the object of their unalloyed admiration and affection. In the lapse of time between that period and the one at which Mr. Jefferson received the assurances he de scribes great changes had taken place in respect to all these matters, but, as I have said, not so adverse as might on first impression be supposed to the practica bility of an attempt such as Washington referred to. The army of the Revolution had indeed been dissolved, and, in regard to the elements of which it Avas princi pally composed, beyond recall ; but its officers, who, next to Washington, were capable of giving a tone and direc tion to the spirit of the troops, were alive, several of them again under his command, not a few about his person, and all filled with unabated admiration and affection for their idolized chief. If the account given us by Mr. Jef ferson of the feelings he found most prevalent in our principal cities and at the seat of government on his return from France and in his progress to Philadelphia, to take upon himself the office of Secretary of State, is to be relied upon, \u2014 and many important contemporaneous occur rences corroborate his statement, \u2014 sad changes had taken place in the public opinion and feeling, of absorbing interest in this connection. \" The President,\" he says, \" received me cordially, and my colleagues and the circle of principal citizens apparently Avith welcome. The cour tesies of dinner-parties given me, as a stranger newly arrived among them, placed me at once in familiar society."], [135, "TN THE UNITED STATES. 113 But I cannot describe the wonder and mortification Avith which the table conversations filled me. Politics were the chief topic, and a preference of kingly over republican governments was evidently the favorite sentiment.\" In his description of what he heard and saw there can be no mistake ; but it is more than probable that changes among the people at large, upon the point spoken of, had not occurred to anv thing like the same extent as among those portions of society to which he more particularly refers. Still it is undeniably true that from the influence of exam ples set by men in high places, from the difficulties under Avhich the late government had labored, and from other causes, there had been at that moment a falling off\" from the true faith respecting governments and the administra tion of them which could now be scarcely credited. Add to these favoring circumstances the fact that the man, with out Avhose countenance or cooperation no reactionary at tempt would have been thought of even by the rankest advocate for monarchical institutions, Avas at the head of the Government to be overthroAvn, and the unquestioned object of the national confidence and affection, and the scheme, with his cooperation, Avas not likely to be then regarded as so impracticable as it Avould noAV certainly be considered. If such a Avork were at this day thought of by any man or men, hoAvever elevated in position or loved by the people, they could reap no other harvest than contempt and derision ; but the single fact that Washington, Avho always handled serious matters seriously, and Avho Avas not liable to be alarmed by \" false fires,\" treated the subject as he did, is sufficient to mark the difference between the condition of the country and of the public mind then and now. But happily for us he was the same man in 1793 that he was in 17S3. The principle upon which he acted upon both occasions was maintained through life without spot or 8"], [136, "114 POLITICAL PARTIES blemish. The Avorld believed, and for the best reasons, that he had refused to become the master of a people, whose liberties he had, through the favor of God and the fortitude and bravery of his countrymen, been made instru mental to establish, because he deemed it a higher honor to be their servant.

Services have been rendered in every age which entitled the actors in them to the gratitude of their country, and to the thanks of mankind, but lacking the distinguishing feature of Washington's, their traces have become fainter with the lapse of time, whilst the remembrance of his un equaled merits grows more distinct and strong Avith each revolving year. That he committed grave errors in giving his sanction, probably with considerable reluctance, to some of the measures of his administration, is certain. I say this not merely on the strength of my own poor opinion, but be cause such is the unreserved and irreversible judgment of the country, to Avhich, under a republican government, the acts of all public men are subjected. But the assent which he gave to these measures Avas never, even by those most opposed to them, attributed to him as a fault, but was re garded only as an honest error of opinion ; and hence the extraordinary political phenomenon of a party having its origin in the adoption by him of those measures expelling from power his immediate successor, who claimed to act upon his principles, placing those principles by protracted and diligent efforts under the ban of public opinion, and keeping them and their supporters there, in the main, for more than half a century \u2014 and yet being not a Avhit"], [137, "115 IN THE UNITED STATES. behind those Avho approved them in its respect for his name and character, because its members, in the eloquent language of Mr. Jefferson, \" would not suffer the tempo rary aberration to Aveigh against the immeasurable merits of his life ; and although they tumbled his seducers from their places, they preserved his memory embalmed in their hearts Avith undiminished love and devotion, and there it forever Avill remain embalmed in entire oblivion of every temporary thing Avhich might cloud the glories of his splendid life.\""], [138, "POLITICAL PARTIES 116 CHAPTER III.

THAT the policy of every administration of the Fed- eral Government for the first tAvelve years of its existence Avas shaped, and the action of the Federal party guided, by the opinions and advice of Hamilton, Avas the general impression of the opponents of that party, and of course known to the leading Federalists. I have in another place1 referred to the fact that Mr. Jefferson, in -all my conversations with him in 1824\", when he spoke of the 1 See note, p. 9."], [139, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 117 course pursued by the Federal party, invariably personified it by saying \" Hamilton \" did or insisted thus ; and, on the other hand, \" the Republicans \" held or claimed so and so ; and that upon my calling his attention to the peculiarity of his expression, he smiled and attributed his habit to the universal conviction of the Republicans that Hamilton directed every thing. But the evidence they possessed of the truth of that impression was slight indeed in com parison with that Avhich is now before the country. They had only the opinions given in the cabinet upon the im portant public questions that arose during that period, with the decisions of the President upon them and other public documents relating to them, and the general conjectural impressions on the minds of politicians, Avhich can seldom be traced to any specific authority, in respect to the in fluence which governs the action of parties. The additions noAV made by the publication of Hamilton's private papers alone, and more especially when they are read iu connection with those of other distinguished public men, prove those impressions to have been well founded, and to an extent far beyond what was even imagined in those days. I had read these papers Avith care, and, I hope, Aveighed their con tents Avith candor, before I gave my assent to the declara tion of Mr. Charles F. Adams upon the subject, quoted on p. 96 above. Many of General Washington's letters to Hamilton are marked \"private,\" and some \"private and confidential.\" It is not for me to decide upon the propriety of their publication, however much I may regret that the friends of the latter should have deemed that course neces sary in respect to many of them. I content myself Avith a general reference to those Avhich have a bearing upon the point under consideration, Avithout making extracts or adding remarks explanatory of their tendency and effect. The letters between Washington and Hamilton more par-"], [140, "118 POLITICAL PARTIES ticularly in point will be found in the fifth volume of Ham ilton's \"Works,\" p. 106, in ansAver to letter at p. 12; and in the sixth volume, at pp. 19, 34-, 35, 36, 52, 63, 64, 73, 90, 143, 156, 179, 197; those between Hamilton and members of Washington's cabinet, in the sixth vol ume, at pp. 29, 41, 67, 129, 238. The steps taken by General Hamilton to shape the policy and to prescribe the action of Mr. Adams's admin istration were designed to embrace its entire course, and Avere carried into effect Avith but little respect for the wishes or opinions of its constitutional head. Three Aveeks had not elapsed after Mr. Adams's inauguration before General Hamilton wrote a letter to Mr. Pickering, Secretary of State, in Avhich he expressed \" his extreme anxiety that an exactly proper course should be pursued in regard to France,\" and suggested for his 'consideration, under seven different heads, what he thought that course ought to be. The Secretary was not requested to submit these views to the President, nor was any desire indicated that he should do so, nor any notice taken of the President in the letter further than may be found in the closing paragraph, \u2014 \" The executive, before Congress meet, ought to have a well-digested plan and cooperate in getting it adopted.\" If there Avas a single instance in Avhich Hamilton, in his numerous letters of advice to the Secretaries, requested them to submit his views to the consideration of the Presi dent, it has escaped my observation. He was several times spoken of, but generally as to Avhat he ought to do and Avhat he might or might not be induced to do. The letters and papers bearing upon the subject will be found in the sixth volume of Hamilton's \" Works,\" at pp. 213, 215, 218, 246, 250, 251, 252, 269, 278, 292, 294, 881, 444, 447, 471, 477, 484. During the Avhole period Hamilton Avas regarded as the"], [141, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 119 leader of the Federal party by most of the prominent members of that party, \u2014 Mr. Adams and a few of his friends excepted, \u2014 by those who represented the country abroad, by members of Congress, &c, &c. He was con sidered the fountain head of partisan authority, Avas freely applied to for advice, and gave it Avhen it Avas asked, and quite as freely Avhen it Avas not. He from time to time furnished members of Congress Avith specifications of steps proper to be taken, in one of Avhich will be found sug gested the passage of the celebrated sedition law. A few instances of his interference in this form will be found in Volume V. Hamilton's \" Works,\" pp. 79, 86, and in Volume VI. at pp. 92, 94, 381, 383, 390. The most important, if not the only occasions on which the influence of Hamilton over the action of the Federal party was exerted without success, were those of the for mation of the Federal Constitution, and the support of Aaron Burr, by that party, for President, and for Governor of NeAv York in 1801 and 1S04. The first can scarcely be regarded, however, as such an occasion, because it was one in Avhich party distinctions Avere merged in a compromise to which he himself ultimately assented. The others be long to the number of those occasions Avhich, from time to time, present themselves in the history of all political parties, Avhen the lust of power overrides the advice of their ablest and best friends. A party which has been long out of power, or which, having long held it, is threatened Avith imminent danger of losing it, can rarely resist the tempta tion when it is presented of securing success by dividing its opponents. Such a temptation is almost always strong enough to silence other objections, and Hamilton, on those occasions, shared the fate of party leaders Avho place their individual influence in opposition to the excited passions and short-sighted schemes of their party."], [142, "120 POLITICAL PARTIES It Avas my fortune to hear Hamilton's great speech against the support of Burr for the office of Governor of New York by the Federalists of the State. I happened to visit Albany on the day appointed for the meeting, in com pany with William P. Van Ness, Avho was a few months afterwards Burr's second in his duel with Hamilton ; and Ave lodged, as Ave Avere in the habit of doing, at Leicis's Tavern, the place where the meeting was to be held. Our room adjoined and communicated with the larger one in Avhich the meeting took place ; and after its organization, Mr. Van Ness threw open the door between the rooms, giving us a full view of the assemblage and exposing our presence to them. I mention these circumstances, which I recollect well, because it is my impression that it was very unusual at that day for politicians of one party to at tend the meetings of the other. Mr. Van Ness and myself differed irreconcilably in respect to the support of Colonel Burr, but we were both members of the Re publican party. The meeting consisted of about one hun dred very respectable looking men, generally Avell advanced in life, and I remember many gray heads among them. Such was a gathering of the Federalists, in a city in which they had complete control, called together to hear the leader of their party, decidedly the most eloquent man of his day, a little more than fifty years ago. Quantum mntatus ! My seqt was so near to Hamilton that I could hear distinctly every word he said, and three impressions of the scene are still strong in my memory \u2014 his imposing manner and stirring eloquence, the obvious disinclination of the larger portion of his audience to be governed by his advice, notwithstanding the unbounded respect and love they bore him, and the marked indignation Avhich often sparkled on the countenance of Van Ness whilst he was speaking."], [143, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 121 Preferring monarchical institutions because he conscien tiously believed that republican government could not be maintained \"consistently Avith order,\" but satisfied that public opinion would not then admit of their establishment in this country, and indisposed for the reasons I have assigned to advocate the use of force for that purpose, yet expecting a crisis to arrive by which the opinions of the people Avould be changed, or the use of force be rendered justifiable, Hamilton entered the cabinet of President Washington determined to recommend a line of policy and the adoption of measures, which, whilst they Avould give the Government sufficient power to sustain itself against the democratic spirit of the country, \u2014 always the object of his dread, \u2014 Avould not be out of place Avhen a resort to the English model, the object of his life-long choice, should have become necessary. If, in the execution of this policy, he had confined himself to the poAvers in tended to be conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitution, however much his conduct might 'have been censured on account of the anti-republican spirit it evinced, it wotdd nevertheless have presented a very dif ferent aspect to posterity. But this Avas unhappily far from his intention. No one knew better than Hamilton that poAver to adopt some of the most important of the measures included in the chart he had devised for the action of the Federal Government was not designed to be granted to it either by those who framed, or by those who had adopted the Constitution, and that if there had been any reason to suspect that that instrument conferred such poAvers there would not have been the slightest chance for its ratification. The Convention that framed the Constitution Avas Avell aware that the portion of its labors Avhich related to the extent of the poAvers to be given to the new government"], [144, "122 POLITICAL PARTIES was that upon which the public mind Avas most sensitive. It Avas not ignorant how far the apprehensions of the people upon that point had, through the entire period of our colonial history, prevented the establishment of any general government, and even the institution of one since the Declaration of Independence that AAras adequate to the necessities of the country. It kneAv that the powers given to Congress, particularly, Avould be the part of the Consti tution to which the attention of the friends of the State governments would be directed, and upon which their opposition Avould be most likely to arise. Understand ing these things, the Convention, Avith that good sense and prudence by which its entire course Avas so greatly dis tinguished, bestowed upon that branch of its business the utmost care and circumspection. Instead of describing the power given to Congress in general terms, as Avas done by Hamilton, in the plan submitted by him for its adoption, \u2014 viz. : \" To pass all laAA's which they shall judge necessary to the common defense and general welfare of the Union,\" \u2014 by which much would of necessity be left to the discretion of those Avho were to execute the power, the Convention specified the powers it intended to grant under seventeen heads, and described them in the simplest and plainest language, so that none should be at a loss to understand their import. So Avell was this design executed that no room for doubt or cavil remained to those Avho had no other desire than to arrive at the meaning of the framers of the Constitution. Here the Convention might have stopped, for no im plication could have been more unavoidable than that Con gress should have the right to promulgate the rules they adopted by the enactment of laAvs. But as if aAvare of* the uses which the able men from Avhom it apprehended opposition might make of the fact that a necessity of a"], [145, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 123 resort to implication had been left by the instrument, it granted that power also in express terms. The principal part of that clause Avas moreover designed to constitute Congress the law-maker for the other great departments of the government, and to exclude the idea that they should also have the power of legislation. Having thus, as it thought, guarded the Avork of its hands from misrepresentation or misinterpretation upon Avhat it justly considered the most delicate and, if disre garded, the most vulnerable point, and having framed a Constitution with which all friends to republican principles ought to be satisfied, the Convention appealed Avith confi dence to the ratifying conventions, and in doing so it did no more than justice to those bodies, \u2014 the instrument, thus guarded, Avas ultimately ratified by the votes of all the States. If Hamilton, either in the articles of the \"Federalist,\" to which he largely contributed, or on the floor of the Con vention of Ratification, of Avhich he Avas a member, had only countenanced that construction of the Constitution which he set up for it as Secretary of the Treasury, or if in any other way a suspicion had been produced that it was intended to give that instrument such a construction after its ratification, its rejection A\\rould have been inevitable. No one Avho has studied the state of the public mind at that period can for a moment doubt that this Avould have been the result. Such was the true character of the Con stitution Avhich the people of the United States intended to establish, and thought they had established, and such were the circumstances under which it was ratified. Hamilton Avas placed by Washington virtually at the head of his administration ; for, although the Secretary of State has, since that period, been regarded in that light, no such impression had then obtained, and in the government"], [146, "124 POLITICAL PARTIES of Great Britain, to Avhich attention had been most directed, it was otherwise. The Treasury Department Avielded in- finitely the most influence, and the superior confidence of the President in the incumbent decided the point of priority, at least for the time being. Perhaps the only question in respect to Hamilton upon which there has never been any diversity of sentiment Avas in regard to his talents. That they Avere of the highest order Avas the opinion of all Avho knew him. Jefferson scarcely ever spoke of him in his letters to Madison without admonishing him of the extraor- dinary powers of his mind, and in one of them he says, \u2014 \" Hamilton is really a Colossus to the Anti-Republican party; Avithout numbers he is a host in himself. In truth when he comes forward there is nobody but yourself (Madison) that can meet him.\" When I was Minister of the United States in England I saw much of Prince Talleyrand, then French Ambassador at the same Court, and enjoyed relations of marked kindness with him. In my informal visits to him we had long and frequent con- versations, in which Hamilton, his acquaintance with him in this country, and incidents in their intercourse, were his favorite themes. He always spoke Avith great admiration of his talents, and during the last evening that I spent with him he said that he regarded Hamilton as the ablest man he became acquainted with in America, \u2014 he Avas not sure that he might not add Avithout injustice, or that he had known in Europe.1 With such advantages, greater at 1 At the same interview Talley rand told me an anecdote which, con sidering the depressed condition of Colonel Burr at the period to which it referred, I thought descriptive of a harsh act on the part of my informer, and I do not repeat it without hesi tation. \"Burr,\" he said, 41 called in pursuance of a previous communica tion from him, and, his card being brought up, he directed the messen- ger to say that he could not receive a visit from Colonel Burr, and refer red him, for an explanation of his re fusal, to a painting hanging over the mantel -piece in the antechamber, which was a portrait of Hamilton.\" The visit was probably one of courtesy, with a possible hope of be ing able to enlist Talleyrand in his (burr's) Mexican schemes."], [147, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 125 that time certainly than the public service of any country afforded to any other man, it is difficult to conceive of a more commanding position than that which he occupied. With a mind that dwelt habitually upon great ideas, the political career of such a man could not fail to produce important results for good or for evil. It must not, how ever, be forgotten, for it is a truth Avhich exerted a power ful influence on his Avhole course, that he Avas at the same time, as his friend Morris described him, \"more a theoretic than a practical man.\" It Avas natural that a mind so easily excited and an imagination so vivid as Hamilton's seem always to have been, should have formed exaggerated ideas as well of the extent and character of the embarrass ments under which the country Avas laboring, as of the causes from which they sprang. These were undoubtedly very serious, very difficult to be dealt with ; and it is equally true that they had been greatly aggravated by, if they were not, as he was very willing to consider them, mainly attributable to the defects of the former federal sys tem. But there Avas some misapprehension, and no small degree of exaggeration upon these points. We are in deed an imaginative people, and the transfer of our fathers to a new country and climate doubtless accounts for the great difference in this respect between ours and the cool, deliberate, and unimpressible temperaments and character retained by those in Europe who have the same descent. It Avas not to have been expected that a country so young as our own, and as unprepared, could have passed through a seven years' war Avith a powerful nation without involv ing itself in grave embarrassments ; but when the extent of those embarrassments, the difficulties of dealing with them, and the then resources of the country are now re garded, it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that the grounds for the alarm then so prevalent upon the subjects"], [148, "126 POLITICAL PARTIES of the public credit and the public revenues were greatly overrated. Our Avhole foreign debt amounted to but twelve millions of dollars, payable by instalments, the last of which did not become due until seven years thereafter. The domestic debt amounted to forty-two millions, for the payment of Avhich the Government was under no obligation to make immediate provision, amounting in all to fifty-four millions, and the annual expenses of the Government Avere estimated at less than six hundred thousand dollars. This was the full extent of federal responsibilities. Hamilton assumed some fifteen millions of the State debts, but that was an act entirely voluntary, neither asked nor desired by the States, unconstitutional anil inexpedient, and caused as much unpopularity to his administration of the department as, perhaps more than, any act by Avhich it was distin guished. To meet these responsibilities the neAv Constitution had placed in the hands of the Federal Government the poAver of collecting a revenue from imposts and taxes, to borroAV money on the credit of the United States to any amount which the public service might be deemed to require, and to regulate commerce, both foreign and domestic, \u2014 a power from the exercise of Avhich great improvements in the trade of the country Avere justly anticipated. In aid of these resources Ave possessed a population of some three and a half millions, as active and enterprising as any on the face of the earth, just emerging from the dis couragements of a defective government, and bounding with hope into all the varieties of business and labor, for which a fertile soil and a salubrious climate afforded the most ample facilities.

Cer tain I am that if <a similar comparison Avere made between the difficulties Avhich the Treasury Department of the Federal Government had to contend with in 1790, and those which it encountered in 1837, combined with the powerful and active hostility of the United States Bank, the former would lose much of the apparent importance with Avhich tradition, the influence of a great name, and the rhetorical applauses of modern political orators, of the Federal school, have invested them.1 The condition of things at the period AA'e are considering Avas such as to promise the greatest advantages from the simplest, though persevering and well-considered, employ ment of the means then for the first time placed at the dis posal of the General Government.

The practical character of Madison's talents and disposition had been exemplified in the whole of his previous career, and Avas conspicuous in his course on the subject of revenue. On the second day after the votes for President and Vice- President under the new Constitution had been canvassed, and twenty days before the inauguration of President Washington, he commenced operations in the new House of Representatives, of Avhich he Avas a member, to enable the new government to avail itself of the advantages secured to it by the Constitution in regard to revenue. To this end he introduced a bill to impose impost and tonnage duties by which he believed all the objects of a national revenue could be secured without being oppressive to the country, and pursued his object day in and day out, until his bill became a law. A prompt application of the means thus acquired to the regular payment of the interest on the public debt, with a resort to others authorized in express terms by the Constitution if the impost had not proved adequate to all the objects of a national revenue, as he believed it Avould, and a discreet use of the poAver to borrow exerted in the ordinary way, accompanied by proper efforts to keep public expenditures at the West point con sistent with an efficient public service, Avould in all prob ability have been the sum of the measures which' Mr. Madison would have deemed necessary to place the public credit at the highest desirable point and to discharge all"], [151, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 129 the existing obligations of the Government. They consti tute all the means employed by the department now, and for several years past have proved abundantly sufficient to meet infinitely higher responsibilities, and there is in truth no conclusive reason to be found in the history of the period referred to why they would not have performed the same offices then. But these simple and usually efficacious measures did not come up to Hamilton's standard. They fell short of what he thought necessary to the actual Avants of the pub lic service, and still more so in regard to what he deemed due to the efficiency, stability, and dignity of the Govern ment. To secure all of these objects he desired to build up a financial system Avhich would approach to an equality with the English model after which he designed to con struct it ; aud he believed that it was in that way only that the public necessities could be amply provided for, the public credit placed at the point Avhich he wished it to occupy, and the respectability of the Government be prop erly consulted. But this plan required the adoption of measures Avhich, it is not too much to say, he knew that neither those Avho framed nor those Avho adopted the Con stitution intended to authorize.

The subject of internal improvements by the Federal Government, in regard as well to the power of the latter over the subject as to the expediency of its exercise, was repeatedly and very fully discussed in Congress, whilst Mr. Rufus King and myself represented the State of New York in the Senate of the United States.

Notwithstanding this agreement the subject was often canvassed between us in respect to the arguments advanced, from time to time, in Congress, by others. On one of those occasions, he told me that on Gouverneur Morris's visit to the city of New York, soon after his return from the Federal Convention, he Avas con gratulated by his friends on the circumstance that the Convention had succeeded in agreeing upon a Constitution which would realize the great object for which it had been convened, and that Morris promptly and, as Mr. King seemed to have understood it, significantly replied \u2014 \" That will depend upon the construction that is given to it!\" Mr. King did not state any inference he had drawn from the remark and seemed to me indisposed to prolong the conversation upon that point, and, knoAving his habitual reserve in speaking of his old associates, I yielded to Avhat I believed to be his wish not to be questioned, although I was at the moment strongly impressed by the observa tion. I referred to it afterwards in a speech I made in the Senate upon the powers of the Government, which Avas extensively published. At a subsequent period this ready answer of Morris would not have attracted notice ; but spoken before even a single officer had been elected to carry the Constitution into effect, and of course before any question as to its construction had arisen, it was to my mind, and, as I believe, to the mind of Mr. King, evidence of a foregone conclusion to claim under that instrument powers not anticipated by the great body of those who framed it, or by those who had given it vitality by their approval. The facts that this reply had been so lono remembered by Mr. King, a prominent and sagacious member of the Convention, and repeated under the cir cumstances I have detailed, were calculated to create such"], [153, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 131 an impression. It gave, at least to my view, a decided direction in respect to the source from whence the doctrine of implied potvers originated. I had found it difficult, with the opinions I had formed of Hamilton's character and dispositions, to reconcile the first suggestion of such a policy with them. I could believe that, in accordance with the principles which he avowed, he might be not unwilling to carry it into effect when it was suggested to him ; but that, after advancing his opinions in a manner so frank and fearless, notwithstanding their well understood unpopu- larity, he should be found mousing over the words of the . Constitution for equivocal expressions, containing a mean* ing intelligible only to the initiated, and by such methods preparing to spring a trap upon the people, was, it ap- peared to me, utterly foreign to his nature and habits. Neither was I disposed to believe that he would, at the very moment of signing, have denounced the Constitution as inadequate to the purposes of good government if he had then regarded it as possessing the very extensive powers he afterwards assisted in claiming for it, nor would he have subsequently declared it to be \" a frail and worth- less fabric.\" His complaint upon the latter occasion would have been against the construction that had been given to it, and not against the Constitution itself. Morris, whose ability no one Avill question, was a con stant attendant upon the Convention, took an active part in its proceedings throughout, was on most of its com mittees and the tvorking-man of the last, \u2014 the duties of which were \" to revise the style of, and arrange the articles Avhich had been agreed to by the House,\" \u2014 and the second and last draft of the Constitution Avas reported by him. But it is noAV comparatively unimportant with whom the latitudinarian construction of the Constitu tion, which has caused so much strife and contention and"], [154, "132 POLITICAL PARTIES so little advantage to any person, party, or interest, origi nated. Hamilton, at least, adopted it as the corner-stone of his constitutional views, and, by his genius and the weight of his official influence, gave it a temporary sue- cess. For reasons which will appear in the sequel, I will con fine myself to a simple statement of the questions that were raised in respect to the construction of the Constitu tion, and a few illustrations of their character. That in strument, as has already been stated, contained a specific enumeration of the powers given to Congress, and the reasons have been also described for this particularity. s The measures to which they referred were known by ap propriate and distinct names, and applied to definite and well understood objects, and they have been ever since known and understood as they were then. This enumera tion of the powers of Congress was followed, as we have seen, by a grant of authority to that body to \"make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.\" Under this Avinding-up clause of the Constitutional enumeration of the powers of Congress, the true sense and object of Avhich was so easy to be understood, Hamil ton claimed for that body the power of authorizing by law measures of a substantive character, described by well understood names, altogether different from those employed in the enumeration, such as the incorporation of banks, &c, &c, if Congress should declare itself of the opinion that the execution of the enumerated powers Avould be materially aided by any such measures, reserving to Con gress the right of deciding whether the proposed measure would be sufficiently useful to create the \" propriety and necessity \" required by the Constitution, and placing in its breast alone the final decision of every such question."], [155, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 133 The objects of the Constitution, as set forth in its pre amble, Avere \"to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the com mon defense, promote the general Avelfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\" The first of the powers of Congress, contained in the enumera tion of them in the Constitution, is in the following words: \" The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties, and imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;\" \u2014 and then follow all the other powers, to borrow money, &c. The terms \"common defense and general AA'elfare,\" used in this enumeration, Avere taken from the Articles of Confederation, Avhere they stood thus : \" All charges of war, and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common defense and general welfare, and allowed by the United States, in Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common treasury, Avhich shall be supplied by the several States in proportion,\" &c. Under those Articles they Avere never understood as a substantive grant of power to the Continental Congress, or as authorizing that body to ask from the States moneys, and to expend them for any purposes other than those which the Articles after wards specified. By the new Constitution the manner of getting the money was happily changed from State requi sitions to taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to be expended, however, when so obtained, for the common defense and general welfare, as before, and the Constitution then, like the Articles of Confederation, says upon what objects it is to be expended. The Convention which framed and those which ratified the instrument, of course, understood the terms as used in the same sense. But after the Constitu-"], [156, "134 POLITICAL PARTIES tion was ratified, without an intimation of such a con struction having been whispered before, it Avas contended by many that the manner in which the terms common de fense and general Avelfare were used in it authorized Con gress to adopt any measure which that body might deem calculated to subserve the common defense and general welfare of the country, whilst others, less reckless, limited the poAver they claimed for Congress to the application of money to any such measures. Among the former, as to the clause in the preamble, Hamilton placed himself, in sisting that, under the grant of powers to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying its given powers into execution, Congress had the power to adopt every measure of government not expressly denied to it or exclusively granted to the States, which it should deem useful in the execution of its enumerated powers, hoAvever variant in its name, object, and general understanding ; and under the clause quoted from the preamble an unlimited power of taxation, and an equally unlimited authority to expend the money so raised upon objects which it might think Avould promote the common defense and general welfare. He thus claimed for Congress substantially all legislative poAver, save such as was expressly prohibited to it, given exclusively to the States, or denied to both, falling but little if any thing short of the power he assigned to the national legislature in his propositions submitted to the Convention, which that body would not even consider, viz. : \" to pass all laAvs which they shall judge necessary to the common defense and general Avelfare of the Union.\" When the advocates of these doctrines were asked to re member the state of public opinion at the time Avhen the Constitution was framed ; the jealousy Avhich then existed and had for so many years existed, of the power of the Government ; the fact that the apprehensions which"], [157, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 135 had been entertained had so long prevented the calling of a Convention ; the extreme improbability that the Conven tion, under such circumstances, could ha\\-e intended to give to Congress the power to pass any laAv it might be pleased to regard as useful in the execution of an enumer ated poAver, whatever might be its bearing upon the State governments; to add to the poAver to make peace and war and to raise armies and equip fleets ; to make the power to raise money unlimited by authorizing its expenditure upon any measure Congress might assume to be conducive to the common defense and general welfare, and the absurdity of the supposition that the grant of such far reaching and absorbing powers would have been conferred in so obscure a Avay, and that the Constitution Avould have passed the scrutiny of so many State Conventions without its ever having been intimated in any Avay that there lay concealed in its general terms grants of poAver which, if but suspected, Avould have set the country in a blaze, and would have produced instant refusals to ratify on the part of most of the States, \u2014 when such considerations Avere opposed to those bold pretensions, the only reply was, the Constitution must be construed by its letter, and we cannot look behind it or beside it for the means of doing so truly. To the answer that extraneous matter has always been allowed by all laws, state and national, to be used in the interpretation of the highest acts of sovereignty, such as the construction of treaties between sovereign powers, of patents issued under the great seal, of acts of Parliament, of Congress, and of State legislatures, and in respect to the latter class the old laAv, the mischief and the proposed remedy to be taken into consideration in searching for the meaning of such acts, in the construction of wills, deeds, &c, &c, the only rejoinder was that a Constitution was an exception to those rules ; in short that a Constitution Avas"], [158, "136 POLITICAL PARTIES the sole exception to the application of the maxim Avhich has groAvn out of the observation and experience of man kind, \u2014 qui h\u00e6ret in lilerd h\u0153ret in cortice. The nearness of the time Avhen the Constitution was framed to the period of which Ave are speaking gave to this construction its most repulsive aspect. The members of the Federal Convention Avere yet ou the stage of action, and many of them participators in the measures that were brought forward on the strength of it. The remonstrances of those who dissented on the ground of their own knowl edge that the Convention did not contemplate such a con struction were disregarded, not because they did not repre sent the truth but because the objection Avas inadmissible upon principle. This was emphatically the case in respect to the establishment of a national bank, the pioneer of constitutional infractions, the \" Avooden horse \" from whose sides the most violent assaults have been made upon the Constitution. It was a fact well remembered by the mem bers, and subsequently confirmed by the publication of the journal of the Convention, that a motion was made to give to Congress power to grant acts of incorporation, as facilities to public improvements. This fact Avas brought to the notice of President Washington by Mr. Jefferson, in his opinion upon the bank question : \" It is known,\" said he, \" that the very power now proposed as a means Avas rejected as an end by the Convention Avhich formed the Constitution ; a proposition Avas made to them to authorize Congress to open canals, and an amendatory one to empoAver them to incorporate, but the Avhole was re jected, and one of the reasons of rejection urged in the debate Avas that then they would have poAver to erect a bank, which would render the great cities, where there were prejudices or jealousies upon this subject, adverse to the reception of the Constitution.\""], [159, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 137 This communication Avas made directly to General Washington, Avho had been President of the Convention, and made to defeat a measure of Hamilton's, Avho never failed to turn every proposition of his opponents against themselves when it was in his power to do so. It re mained unnoticed, and its truth was therefore virtually admitted. Upon the very first question, then, which arose under the Constitution upon Hamilton's construc tion, and that one first also in importance, the well known intentions of the Convention were directly and in tentionally overruled. President Washington gave no reasons for his decision in favor of the Bank Bill. I will hereafter state the prin ciple upon Avhich I think it fair to presume that he acted. Hamilton Avas influenced by views which governed his con duct in every constitutional question that arose in his day. He did not, because he could not with any show of pro priety, deny that the Constitution ought in strictness to be construed according\" to the intentions of those Avho made it ; but believing, doubtless sincerely, from the beginning, that, so construed, it was insufficient for the purposes of good government and must prove a failure, he designedly gave it construction, in cases Avhere he deemed that course necessary to the public interest, in opposition to Avhat he knew to have been the intentions of the Convention. The objection that this was setting at naught the declared will of the people had but little weight with him. He believed that a majority of the Convention would have been content to incorporate the powers he now claimed in the Constitu tion if they had not been deterred by the fear that it would not be ratified, and for the opinion of a majority of the people he made proverbial his want of respect. He held them incapable of judging in such questions. He was as anxious as any man to promote their happiness and Avel-"], [160, "138 POLITICAL PARTIES fare, but he thought it a political necessity that this could only be done in despite of themselves ; no man could pos sibly be less prone than he Avas to the employment of sinis ter means in private life, and yet he held them excusable in dealing with the people ; he thought nothing effectual and salutary could be done Avith them Avithout appeals to their special interests, without exciting their passions and turning them to the side of the Government. This Avas the vicious feature of his political creed, and proofs of its existence could be multiplied almost without end; but, as the sub ject Avill unavoidably and often present itself, I will content myself here Avith an extract from a letter written by him to his friend Morris, after the great public transactions in Avhich he had been engaged were principally ended. The last letter to Morris, from which I have quoted, spoke of the past ; this looks to the future, and shows the lengths to which he was yet, as he had always been, willing to go. The letter is dated April 6, 1802, in which, after compli menting Morris upon his efforts \" in resisting the follies of an infatuated administration,\" he thus points his friend to the work before them : \u2014 \" But, my dear sir, Ave must not content ourselves Avith a temporary effort to oppose the approach of evil. We must derive instruction from the experience before us, and learning to form a just estimate of things to Avhich we have been attached, there must be a systematic and perse vering endeavor to establish the fortune of a great empire on foundations much firmer than have yet been devised. What will signify a vibration of poAver if it cannot be used Avith confidence or energy, and must be again quickly restored to hands Avhich will prostrate much faster than Ave shall be able to rear under so frail a system \\ Nothing will be done until the structure of our national edifice shall be such as naturally to control eccentric passions and"], [161, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 139 views, and to keep in check demagogues and knaves in the disguise of patriots.\"1 This speaks for itself, and certainly nothing could be more superfluous than an attempt to elucidate its import and extent. It deserves to be remembered that this was in the thirteenth year of the Constitution, now described as a \" frail system,\" and Avhich, in a previous letter to Morris, Avas called a \" frail and Avorthless fabric.\" Hamil ton enforced his construction, but upon that point AA'e will say no more until we arrive at a period when it Avas ex posed to a scrutiny by Avhich it Avas forever exploded. Looking to the construction of the Constitution which I have described for his authority to adopt the measures he deemed necessary to establish his policy, he advanced in his work with his accustomed industry and perseverance. The outlines of that policy were substantially portrayed in his speeches in the Federal Convention, in his letter to General Washington from New York during the session of that body, and in a paper Avritten by him after its adjournment, and now published by his son, \u2014 all of which have already been referred to. It was founded on a conviction, doubt less sincere and at all events not liable to change, that great danger to the federal system Avas to be apprehended from the hostility of the State governments, and on a con sequent desire to reduce their power and importance ; on an immovable distrust of the capacities and dispositions of the masses; and on an unshaken belief that the success of the new government could only be secured by assimilat ing its action to that of the English system as nearly as that could be done Avithout too gross, and therefore danger ous, violation of the well understood and most cherished sentiments of the people. The power wielded by the English ministry, in Parlia- 1 Hamilton's Works, Vol. VI. p. 536."], [162, "140 POLITICAL PARTIES ment and in the country, springs from influences derived from various sources, mainly from the funding system, from the Bank of England, from connection with the East India Company, and from ability to confer govern ment favors on individuals and classes in the shape of offices and dignities in church and state, of titles, pensions, bounties, franchises, and other special privileges of great value. Its power in these respects is derived from the crown in virtue of its prerogatives, aided by .acts of Parlia ment where these are required by the Constitution. The measures which Hamilton deemed indispensable to the success of the neAv government, in addition to those authorized by the Constitution, consisted of First. A funding system upon the English plan, Avith authority to assume the separate debts of the States ; Second. A national bank ; and, Third. An unrestricted exercise by Congress of the power to raise money, and the employment of the national revenue in patronizing individual, class, and corporate in terests, according to the plan described in his report, nom inally on manufactures, but embracing an infinite variety of other concerns. The funding system, as presented to Congress by him, as Avell as the bank were not only on the English plan, but as far as that could consistently be effected Avere copies of the originals, and substantially the same reasons for their establishment here Avere assigned in his report as had been given for their first creation in England. The third meas ure, or rather the third iu his system of measures, as set forth in the Secretary's report, partook largely of the general character of some of those alluded to above as sources of ministerial poAver in England, and, in connec tion with the means of securing legitimate influence al lowed by our Constitution, Avould have clothed the admin-"], [163, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 141 istration here with equal power, even Avithout authority to grant titles of nobility, ecclesiastical preferments and dig nities, and other like privileges. The advantages Hamilton anticipated from these meas ures consisted of the effect Avhich the fact of their estab lishment would have upon every question of constitutional power, the popularity and political influence Avhich the administration Avould acquire in and through their organ ization, and greater than all, of their inevitable influence upon the future character of the institutions of the country. He might well think that he would not thereafter have any serious difficulty in regard to constitutional power to do what he desired, if he could obtain the passage of acts, according to the forms of the Constitution, authorizing Congress to lend money to the States under a provision in that instrument giving it power to borrow money ; to establish a national bank, Avhen a possible ground for pre tense to such a poAver had been expressly excluded from the Constitution, and when every body knew that both the Convention that made it and a vast majority of the States and people by Avhom it Avas adopted Avere at the time opposed to such an institution; and not only to raise money upon the principle of an unlimited power to do so, but also to expend it according to the pleasure of the Govern ment, subject to no other limitation than that it should regard the purpose as conducive to the common defense and general Avelfare, \u2014 a principle he distinctly avowed in his report on manufactures. If he had succeeded in these points and secured his advances, he Avould have been fully warranted in regarding the enumeration of the powers of Congress contained in the Constitution as a sham, and the brief clause he proposed to the Convention, giving to the national legislature poAver to pass all laws Avhich it should jud\u00b0*e necessary to the common defense and general Avel-"], [164, "142 POLITICAL PARTIES fare of the Union, as inserted in its place. The increased power and influence derived by the administration in the course of the organization of some of these measures will be seen as we proceed, and my own views in respect to their combined effects upon our institutions and upon the character of the government will be given hereafter. In England the bank Avas first established, but Hamilton gave precedence here to the funding system and made it the first great measure of his administration of the Treas ury Department, contenting himself in the first instance with a declaration, in his report in favor of the funding system, of his intention to connect a bank Avith it. The Secretary's annunciation of the principles upon which he proposed to found that system, and their resemblance to those by Avhich the English system was regulated, Avere received Avith unmistakable signs of dissatisfaction by large portions of the people in all parts of the country. The Legislature of Virginia passed by decided majorities resolu tions denouncing the Secretary's plan Avith great severity. These, with similar demonstrations in other States, show the depth of the excitement of the public mind upon the subject. The public debt of England had its origin in an early practice of' her government to anticipate her resources through loans effected upon pledges of portions of her revenues, to be re-imbursed, principal and interest, at spe cific periods. These Avere made to correspond Avith the time of the probable collection of the taxes out of A\\-hich the loans Avere to be paid ; and such, it may safely be assumed, was also the origin of public debt in all coun tries. For a time these anticipations were limited in their amounts to the actual value of the fund upon the credit of which they were obtained, the loans were discharged ac cording to their terms, and the operation proved to be a"], [165, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 143 great convenience to the government without prejudice to any interest. It was not long, hoAvever, before a practice, originally no other than a fair business transaction, was perverted to screen men in power from the odium of en forcing taxation to repay the principal sum borrowed. The disproportion between the revenues to be received and the anticipations successively charged upon them soon became too great to leave the government able to pay both prin cipal and interest on the loans Avhich its necessities re quired. Some device Avas therefore desirable by Avhich it would be enabled to replenish the public coffers without a too great increase of taxation, Avhich, for obvious reasons, is always the peculiar aversion of those intrusted Avith the management of public affairs. The plan adopted, in lieu of anticipations of the revenue of the character I haA'e described, Avas to make loans upon the credit of the nation, re-imbursable at the pleasure of the government, with special and adequate provisions for the payment of the in terest only, or to borrow money upon perpetual annuity equivalent to the interest of the sum borrowed, government being at liberty to redeem such annuity at any time by paying back the principal sum, Avith authority also to bor row on annuities for terms of years and for lives. These became thenceforth leading features in the English funding system. These facilities proved amply sufficient for every exi gency. The public debt increased Avith unheard of rapidity under the influence and the expenses of the Avars in Avhich England was successively engaged. In 1706, Avhen its foundation Avas laid, it amounted to but little more than five millions sterling, and in 1777 it had increased to one hundred and thirty-six millions sterling. Near the latter period the subjects of public debt, the principles of the English funding system, and their effects in all countries"], [166, "144 POLITICAL PARTIES AA'here they had been adopted, were brought to a searching scrutiny by Adam Smith in his \" Wealth of Nations,\" who demonstrated from reason and experience that they had invariably enfeebled every nation Avhich had embraced them. He insisted that there Avas scarcely an instance in which a public debt contracted and established upon those principles had been fully paid, and that the reA'enues of the countries subject to such incumbrances had been relieved from the destructive effects of an irredeemable public debt, if relieved at all, either by avowed bankruptcy or by pre tended payments through such artifices as adulterations of the coin, or raising its denomination, or by reductions of the rate of interest. In 1786, four years before the introduction of Hamil ton's funding- system, the public debt of England had already increased to ,\u00a3276,000,000 ; and so rapid has been its subsequent growth that the strictures and predictions of Adam Smith are at this day receiving their confirmation in the existence of a national debt of more than \u00a3800, 000,000. Bv no people Avere these facts and circum stances, so far as they had then transpired, better under stood than by ours. They had watched the condition of England, in regard to her increasing debt, through the Revolutionary contest in the hope that she would be com pelled by the very extent of her indebtedness to stay the hand she had uplifted to enslave them. It ought not therefore to have been a matter of surprise to Hamilton and his associates, and cannot he to us vieAving these matters retrospectively, that his recommendation of a funding sys tem, upon the English plan, with a national bank as its adjunct, as the first great measures of the new goArern ment, were received by large portions, probably a majority, of the people, with so much dissatisfaction and distrust of the motives in Avhich the recommendation had its orio-in"], [167, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 145 a distrust naturally produced by the precipitate resort to the system of a nation against which the hostile feel ings of the war had not yet subsided, and Avhich under that system, in the estimation of many sober minded and sa gacious men, was rapidly sinking into the gulf of hope less indebtedness. No necessity can now be perceived for the adoption at that moment of a scheme of such magnitude as that which Hamilton proposed \u2014 one so well calculated to excite jealousy, and against which the warning voice of experi- ence had become so audible. The existing debt, sacred as the price of liberty and entitled to all solicitude for its satisfactory discharge, was not, in view of the increased resources of the Government, either very large or, in any other event than a failure in the payment of interest, in- eligibly situated, or in any great danger of soon becoming impracticable or oppressive. The foreign debt then stood at eleven millions, the principal payable by moderate instal- ments, the last of which, not due till 1808, was never, save a small portion of the French debt, actually funded, and was paid off' during the administration of Mr. Madi- son. The domestic debt of the United States amounted to forty millions, which Secretary Hamilton thought might fairly be regarded as payable at the pleasure of the Gov- ernment. The interest and instalments as they fell due were therefore the principal subjects to be dealt with. The change which had at last been effected in the Con- stitution, securing to the Federal head full power to levy * and collect all necessary revenue, and the prospects of an improving trade and increasing prosperity in every branch of business gave of themselves to the Government a good right to anticipate an improvement in the public credit sufficient to enable it to make direct loans abroad upon fair terms, payable at specific and reasonable periods, as 10"], [168, "146 POLITICAL PARTIES had been before done without these advantages. On the avails of these, with the surplus of an increasing revenue over and above the six hundred thousand dollars, which was all that was asked for the support of Government in other respects than the payment of debts, the Secretary might, it would seem, have safely relied to meet accruing demands on account of the public debt. It is Avell known that such favorable effects resulted from the change Avhich had taken place in the Government and our credit abroad was so greatly improved that loans which had before been obtained with difficulty and in a considerable degree through favor, and in part by means of specific guaranties, were now sought after and taken with avidity in Amster dam and Antwerp. The friends of the Secretary, and those Avho favored his policy, naturally claimed that this favorable change was due to his report, and to the acts that were passed in pursuance of his recommendation. A portion of the effects produced may have been attributable to this cause, but it was rendered quite clear that the im provement could not be thus explained as to Holland, where a large part of our foreign debt Avas held and to which country the Avhole was soon transferred, by the facts that her bankers not only continued to lend freely to our Government in the old way, upon direct loans, payable at specific periods, \u2014 principal and interest, \u2014 but expressly declined, as did also our creditors in Antwerp, to accept our proposal for converting the debts due upon loans of that character into a funded domestic stock. The Avhole of our foreign debt in Holland, that which was due at the time of the passage of the act establish ing the funding system as well as that which Avas subse quently contracted there and at Antwerp, and the principal part of that held elsewhere, Avas paid to the entire satisfac tion of the creditors by the means I have described, and"], [169, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 147 Avithout being funded. The domestic debt, the least diffi cult or delicate to deal Avith, would doubtless have been seasonably and satisfactorily discharged in the same Avay, if General Hamilton had not, at an early age, imbibed an opinion, which he never changed, that a permanent national debt Avas an advantage to any country, and likely to be particularly useful in a confederacy like ours. That such Avas his sincere opinion there cannot be the slightest doubt, and that he contemplated a public debt here of a character as permanent as that was likely to be which then existed in England is fairly to be inferred from his acts. Hamilton's mind Avas from a very early period turned to politics, and of political subjects that of finance was from the beginning the favorite theme of his meditations, among the most prominent results of which was a conviction that of the agencies necessary to good government, whatever might be its form, there Avere none more useful than a well funded public debt and a judiciously constructed national bank. At the early age of twenty-three, Avhilst filling a post of subordinate rank in the army, he ad- dressed an anonymous communication (as I have before mentioned) to Robert Morris, Avhose mind was inclined in the same direction, and who Avas extensively employed in the management of fiscal affairs, enforcing with much ability his favorite ideas. Some of the contents of this communication are given in the \"Life of Hamilton \" by his son. In a subsequent letter to the same gentleman, he argues in support of kindred positions. In his report upon public credit he advances the same favorable opinion, and in substantially the same language, of the effects of the particular debt he proposed to fund upon terms Avhich promised perpetuity. He did, it is true, accompany the latter declaration with a protest against the latitude, invit ing to prodigality, which was sometimes given to the idea"], [170, "148 POLITICAL PARTIES of the utility of a public debt, and Avith a recommendation in savor of the establishment of a sinking fund, and other reservations and qualifications, couched in the guarded terms usually employed by able men in state papers upon controverted public questions. But the report contained nothing inconsistent with the idea of keeping on foot a national debt as long as it did not become \" too large,\" \u2014 a condition that could scarcely fail to give way to the sup posed exigencies of the moment, \u2014 and the farther condi tion of an indispensable necessity for its continuance never found a place in his reports or weight in his opinions. On the contrary, the advantages of a national debt in prepar ing the people for those periods of oppressive assessment to Avhich all nations are occasionally exposed, by constantly levying a reasonable tax to discharge interest, a principal reason in favor of a public debt assigned in his letter to Morris ; the utility and convenience of having always at hand a band Avhose special interest in the stability of the government would promptly rally them to its support, \u2014 an idea never long absent from Hamilton's mind ; the benefits which the agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial in terests would derive from the funding of seventy millions of debt in the form and upon the principles he proposed, giving to it the capacity of being \"substituted for money\" and increasing by that amount the floating capital, and to a great extent the circulating medium of the country ; the beneficial influence of a funded debt in raising the value of land, in proof of which the experience of England is cited, besides supplying those important classes Avith means to improve and enlarge their respective pursuits, and in creasing those facilities by reducing the rate of interest, constituted the arguments and persuasions set forth in glowing and captivating terms in his reports, and though not necessarily confined to a permanent national debt, in-"], [171, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 149 dicate very clearly, to my mind at least, that it Avas such a debt that he had in view. The uses to which the sinking fund had been applied in England and its inefficiency in the reduction of the national debt were Avell understood by the Secretary. The explanations of its greater efficacy here in after times will be given in another place. They had no connection Avith the views that Avere prevalent in the councils of the nation at the moment of which Ave are speaking. Every act of the Secretary Avas in keeping Avith the inference I have stated. In addition to the principle he proposed as the basis of his system, Avhich, if not perpetual funding in ex press terms, postponed redemption to so remote and indefi nite a period as to render it next to certain that it would never occur, there were other circumstances scarcely less confirmatory of the assumption that such was his intention. The stand taken by Hamilton in the provision he pro posed and Avhich was adopted for a portion of the domestic debt had a great influence in creating the impression that his funding system had other than fiscal objects in view. His opponents not thinking either that system or the bank necessary for the public service \u2014 an opinion vindicated and sustained by subsequent experience \u2014 readily attrib uted the strong desire manifested for their establishment to political designs on the part of their author. Jefferson denounced the financial scheme as a \" puzzle to exclude popular understanding and inquiry, and a machine for the corruption of the Legislature.\" In aid of the latter charge, besides going at least some length to sustain the imputation of Hamilton's desire for an unnecessary in crease of the public debt, came these facts : A large proportion of the domestic debt consisted of certificates of indebtedness given by the United States to the soldiers who fought our battles, and to the farmers, manufacturers,"], [172, "150 POLITICAL PARTIES and merchants who furnished supplies for their support. These had been given because the Government had no money, but under promises of speedy payment. The holders Avere frequently driven by their necessities, and by misrepresentations in respect to the chances of pay ment, to part Avith them for trifling amounts. Hatl the matter stopped there, however much regretted and con demned, it might not have attracted the notice Avhich was taken of it. But when Hamilton proposed to put the original holders and the fraudulent purchasers of these certificates upon the same footing, and when it became known to the members of Congress, which sat with closed doors, that the bill Avould pass in that shape, every part of the country was overrun by speculators, sped by horse and packet expresses, buying up large portions of the cer tificates still held by those to Avhom they Avere originally given at the rate of five shillings and, in some instances, of two shillings and sixpence in the pound. It Avas never doubted that members of Congress and their particular friends participated in these speculations, and realized large sums by the certificates being funded at their nomi nal amounts. When the bill came up, several gentlemen, who afterwards became prominent members of the Repub lican party, earnestly supported a proposition to make a composition betAveen the original holders and the as signees of these papers, allowing to the latter the highest prices they had ever brought in the market, and settling with the former for the residue. Such an arrangement might have been effected without embarrassment to the treasury by satisfactory grants of public lands, and the amount of debts might have been thus materially re duced. Mr. Madison in a sensible speech supported the justice of some such composition ; but the friends of the Secretary in Congress, some of them interested in the"], [173, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 151 result, carried the measure Avhich had been elaborately argued in advance by Hamilton, in his report, and by which the whole was aAvarded to the speculators. The entire transaction caused deep disgust in the minds of many who felt solicitous for the purity of the Govern ment, and not a few believed that the scramble which en sued was foreseen and counted upon as a source of influ ence to enlist Congress on the side of the administration. Their hostility to a system susceptible, as they thought, of such practices, Avas of course greatly inflamed. The construction thus placed upon the Secretary's course received its strongest confirmation from his proposal and untiring efforts for the assumption of the State debts. The first object of a prudent financier Avould seem to be to keep the debt he has to deal with at the lowest prac ticable point. Hamilton, on the contrary, whilst strug gling with embarrassments in respect to the debts for Avhich the United States were legally bound, upon the largest portion of which many years of interest had been suffered to accumulate, proposed to increase the liability twenty-five millions by the voluntary assumption of debts which the Federal Government was under no obligations to pay ; an assumption not only unsolicited on the part of the indebted States, but to Avhich there Avas the best reason for believing that several among them would be opposed. The special representatives of the latter in the Senate, where the proposition originated, so earnestly contested it that the clause of the bill to carry it into effect could only be passed by a majority of two, was in the first instance rejected in the House of Representatives against the united influences of the administration, and could only be recon sidered and barely carried by means of a discreditable intrigue to which the Secretary and Mr. Jefferson, as the latter has acknowledged with shame and contrition, were parties."], [174, "152 POLITICAL PARTIES The reasons assigned by Hamilton for this forced as sumption of a debt which had never been audited, and the amount of which they Avere obliged to guess at, though framed Avith his usual ability, cannot, I should think, be now regarded as sufficient to justify the step. The Aveight which they might by any be supposed to possess Avas overbalanced by the obvious unconstitutionality of the measure. It adopted as Avell the debts of the States which, upon the final settlement between them and the United States, Avere found in debt to the latter, as of those Avhich proved to have balances in their favor, and Avas therefore a loan by the Federal Government to the former class of States, made under the power in the Constitution authorizing Congress to borrow money. This measure, like that which preceded it, was Avell cal culated to strengthen the suspicion Avith which the minds of his opponents became thoroughly imbued, that Hamil ton in all his measures had in view the advancement of partisan objects, from its peculiar adaptation to the promo tion of a leading point in his Avhole policy, \u2014 that of Aveak ening State authority and strengthening that of the Gen eral Government at their expense. The distinctness and strength of expression with which this policy Avas avowed by him, in papers published by his son, have already been seen. Among the means suggested Avas the adoption of measures by which the attention of the people might be diverted from the State governments, upon which it AA'as thought to be too intensely fixed, and turned tOAvards the Federal head, and by which their passions might be ex cited and turned in the same channel. What single meas ure could exert geater influence in giving effect to this policy or shoAV more strikingly the hand of a master than that by which the intense and constant solicitude of the holders of twenty-five millions of debts, scattered, in com-"], [175, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 153 paratively small sums, through the different States, and embracing, it is fair to presume, the most active of their citizens, Avas turned from the local authorities to the Fed eral Government, first for the settlement of the amount, and next for the payment of their demands, \u2014 by Avhich the States themselves became liable for the amounts so paid to a Government Avhich, certainly in some of its de partments, regarded them as rival not to say dangerous powers, and by which also the disreputable scramble for those debts, commenced in the case of the certificates of the United States, Avould be revived. The conflicting views entertained upon these subjects by Hamilton and Jefferson soon assumed the form of a dis tinct and Avell defined issue between the friends and political followers of each, \u2014 the former composing the Federal party, and the latter constituting elements of which the Republican party, then in embryo, Avas formed. Hamilton's doctrine, and for a season the avowed creed of his party, was that there were advantages in the existence of a na tional debt which more than counter-balanced any evils that might arise from its unnecessary continuance, and this faith shaped the Avhole course of their action upon the subject. Its subjection to the operations of a sinking fund, and the qualification that the amount of the debt should be kept within proper limits, were of course features in their plat form. Estmiating the results of the former here by its efficiency in England, and instructed by the experience of all nations that restraints upon the accumulation of debt, however solemnly imposed, are of no account with appli cants for grants from the public treasury, and unhappily little more respected by men in power when the importu nities of friends and supporters are brought in competition with the interests of posterity, it was not difficult to fore see the futility of these conditions. Mr. Jefferson, on the"], [176, "154 POLITICAL PARTIES contrary, from the beginning regarded a public debt as a \" mortal canker \" from Avhich it was the duty of the Gov ernment to relieve the country at the earliest practicable moment, and in this spirit he and his friends acted throughout. The subject of Finance had not at that early period been made as familiar to the American mind as it has since become, and the genius of Hamilton and the sanc tion of Washington, Avhich his plans were supposed to receive, were well calculated to discourage opposition to them. But many of those Avho disapproved of his course were not to be moved from what they regarded as the line of duty by any considerations personal to themselves. They resisted Hamilton's financial schemes from the start, and it AA'as in the discussions upon this issue that some, Avho subsequently became famous leaders in the old Re publican - party, fleshed their maiden swords. No two measures ever attracted a larger share of the attention of the American people, excited more deeply their feelings and their apprehensions, or exerted a greater influence upon the politics of this country than did the funding system and the first Bank of the United States. The peculiar results of the contest that Avas waged in respect to them will be noticed hereafter. Hamilton had done much by their establishment and organization to strengthen the Federal arm, and propor tionately to Aveaken the State governments, but. the influ ence he derived from these measures was not sufficiently operative upon several classes whom he desired to concil iate. The wished for impression had been made upon the commercial class, \u2014 at all times a powerful body and by the nature of their pursuits inclined to favor strong gov ernments, banks, and funding systems, \u2014 upon the domes tic creditors of the General Government, upon the cred-"], [177, "IK THE UNITED STATES. 155 itors of the several State governments, upon all who had a passion for gambling in stocks, to Avhose appetites he furnished so much aliment, \u2014 a numerous, crafty, and influential portion of almost every community, \u2014 and upon all Avho wanted to borrow or had money to lend, a class still more numerous. Besides these, Avhom Mr. Canning called the \" train-bands of commerce,\" in general the most dangerous to encounter and the most efficient when at his service, there were still larger interests, and in the aggre gate more powerful, upon Avhom the Secretary desired to make similar impressions and to secure their attachment to his system. In August, 179L whilst concocting the measures by which he hoped to secure the support of these, and flushed by the success which had hitherto crowned his efforts, he thus (as I have already quoted) addressed his great rival, Mr. Jefferson : \u2014 \" I own,\" said he, \" it is my opinion, though I do not publish it in Dan or Beersheba, that the present Govern ment is not that which will answer the ends of society, by giving stability and protection to its rights, and that it will probably be found expedient to go into the British form ; however, since we have undertaken the experiment, I am for giving it a fair course, whatever my expectations may be. The success, indeed, so far, is greater than I had expected, and therefore at present success seems more possible than it had done heretofore, and there are still other and other stages of improvement, Avhich, if the present does not succeed, may be tried and ought to be tried before we give up the republican form altogether.\" First in the order of time among \" the other and other stages of improvement \" with which the prolific mind of the Secretary Avas busied, Avere doubtless those embraced in his \" Report on Manufactures \" which made its appearance"], [178, "156 POLITICAL PARTIES four months afterwards, and Avas probably then in course of preparation. It contains more than a hundred folio pages, in print, and is perhaps the most thoroughly elabor ated and artfully devised state paper to be found in the archives of any country. Manufactures Avere alone spoken of in the title, but it embraced every species of industry that offered the slightest chance of being successfully pros ecuted in the United States, and contained a very full and carefullv considered exposition of their respective condi tions, and of the facilities by which their success might be increased, to extend which to those diversified interests it undertook to show was within the power and the duty of the Government. This report, on account of the striking illustration it affords of the progress of parties, and the powerful influence it exerted upon their fate, is Avell entitled to the fullest notice. But it is not possible within the limits I have prescribed to myself to go as fully into the revieAV of such a paper as justice to the subject Avould require. I must therefore content myself Avith an abridged account of the various branches of industry the advancement of which Avas the design of its author, and of the manner in which he proposed to accomplish his object. The manufactured articles which he specified as fit sub jects for governmental aid Avere those made of skins, of iron, of wood, of flax and hemp, bricks, coarse tiles, and potters' Avares, ardent spirits and malt liquors, writing and printing paper, hats, refined sugars, oils of animals and seeds, soap and candles, copper and brass wares, tin wares, carriages of all kinds, snuff, cheAving and smoking tobacco, starch, lampblack and other painters' colors, and gunpowder. This enumeration was followed by a de tailed statement of the great variety of articles embraced in the general denominations. Besides these, Avhich he said had attained a considerable degree of maturity, there"], [179, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 157 was a vast sum of household manufacturing Avhich was made not only sufficient for the use of the families that made them but for sale also, and in some instances for exportation, and consisted of great quantities of coarse cloths, coatings, serges, and flannels, linsey-woolseys, ho siery of avooI, cotton and thread, coarse fustians, jeans, and muslins, checked and striped cotton and linen goods, bed ticks, coverlets and counterpanes, tow linens, coarse shirt ings, sheetings, toweling, and table linen, and various mixt ures of avooI and cotton, and of cotton and flax. These observations were, he said, the pleasing result of the investigation into which the subject of his report had led, and Avere applicable to the Southern as well as to the Middle and Northern States. He also designated the principal raAv materials of Avhich these manufactures were composed, and Avhich were, or were capable of being, raised or produced by ourselves. These Avere iron, copper, lead, fossil coal, avooI, skins, grain, flax and hemp, cotton, avooI, silk, &c, &c. The Secretary contended that the growth and produc tion of all the articles last named were, in common with the manufactures of Avhich they constituted the raw mate rial, entitled to the encouragement and specific aid of the Federal Government. He next pointed out the various modes in Avhich that aid might be afforded, varying its application according to circumstances ; viz. : 1st. By protecting duties. 2d. By prohibition of jj-ival articles, or duties equis'alent to prohibition. 3d. By prohibition of the exportation of the materials of manufactures. 4th. By pecuniary bounties. 5th. By premiums."], [180, "158 POLITICAL PARTIES 6th. By exemption of the materials of manufactures from duties. 7th. By drawbacks of duties on the same materials. 8th. By encouragement of new inventions at home and the introduction of others from abroad. 9th. By judicious regulations for the inspection of man ufactured commodities. 10th. By facilitating pecuniary remittances ; and, 11th. By facilitating the transportation of commodities by roads and canals. Of the poAver of the Federal Government to promote the objects spoken of by the means suggested, Avith two exceptions, he said there could be no doubt. The excep tions Avere the encouragement of neAv inventions and the facilities to transportation by roads and canals. In respect to the specific execution of these measures he confessed and regretted that there was some doubt. But to the poAver of giving aid, so far as that could be done by the application of money, he insisted that there Avas no excep tion : \" Whatever concerns the general interest of learn ing, of agriculture, of manufactures, and of commerce are \" he said, \" within the sphere of the national concerns as far as regards an application of money ; \" and he pro posed, first, to raise a fund out of the surplus of addi tional duties laid and appropriated to replace defalcations proceeding from the abolition or diminution of duty diverted for purposes of protection, which he thought AA'ould be more than adequate for the payment of all bounties which should be decreed ; and, secondly, to con stitute a fund for the operations of a board to be estab lished for promoting arts, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce. To this Board he proposed to give power to apply the funds so raised to defray the expenses of the emigration of artists and manufacturers in particular"], [181, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 159 branches of extraordinary importance; to induce the pros ecution and introduction of useful discoveries, inventions, and improvements by proportionate rewards, judiciously held out and applied ; to encourage by premiums, both honorable and lucrative, the exertions of individuals and classes in relation to the several objects they were charged with promoting ; and to afford such other aids to those objects as might be generally designated by law ; \u2014 adding to all this that it often happens that the capitals employed are not equal to the purposes of bringing from abroad workmen of a superior kind, and that here, in cases Avorthy of it, the auxiliary agency of Government Avould in all probability be useful. There are also valuable Avork men in every branch who are prevented from emigrating solely by the Avant of means. Occasional aids to such persons, properly administered, might be, he suggested, the source of valuable acquisitions to the country. The thorough and minute consideration bestoAved on its numerous details, the Avell sustained consistency of the argument Avith the principles upon which it Avas founded, the felicity and clearness Avith which its author's views Avere expressed, and the evidence it furnished of Avell directed and comprehensive research, stamp this remarkable docu ment as the ablest state paper that proceeded from his pen during the whole of his political career. But able as it was, it yet, as we shall see when Ave recur to the action of parties, contributed more than all that he had before done to the prostration of the political standing of its author and to the overthroAV of his party. Its bold assumptions of power and the jubilant spirit in Avhich they Avere ex pressed afforded the clearest indications, as Avell to his opponents as to the country, that he regarded his victory over the Constitution as complete. He spoke of the na tional legislature, unhesitatingly and as one having au-"], [182, "160 POLITICAL PARTIES thority, as possessing, in virtue of the construction of the Constitution he had established, all the poAver Avith very limited exceptions Avhich he insisted in the Convention ought to be given to it. Mr. Jefferson denounced the recommendations of the report to President Washington Avith great Avarmth and earnestness. He described it as going far beyond any pre tensions to power under the Constitution which had yet been set up, and as a document to Avhich many eyes Avere turned as one which AA'as to let us knoAv Avhether we lived under a limited or an unlimited goA'ernment.1 But the vieAvs of the Secretary of the Treasury in the establishment of the policy of which Ave have been speak ing have as yet been but imperfectly described. They had a breadth and an extent of which superficial observers had no idea. The increased strength the General Government derived from turning towards itself so many and such active men as the holders and purchasers of the public debt, State and National, and the influence which the patronage attached to his financial scheme Avould give to the existing administration, were both important, and doubtless entered into Hamilton's designs. The views of common minds might Avell have been limited to such ac quisitions. But these results fell far short of Hamilton's anticipations. His partliaity for the English system, it is natural to presume, arose in some degree from his birth and early training ; but study and reflection, I am inclined to think, had quite as much to do Avith bringing his mind to the conclusions it cherished with so much earnestness. Among the public men of his day there was not one Avho appears to have devoted a larger share of his time to exam inations into and meditation upon public affairs. There was not one who wrote more or with more ease upon the 1 4 Jefferson's Correspondence, p. 457."], [183, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 161 subjects of government in general and public financial questions in particular. Almost every thing he said and wrote and did, in these respects, went to show that the elements of power by Avhich the English government had been raised from a crude and in some degree impracticable condition to the seemingly palmy state at Avhich it had arrived Avhen his successive reports were made had been justly reviewed and thoroughly considered by him. The result of this survey was a conviction that for the favor able changes, as he regarded them, which had taken place in the condition of England she was more indebted to the operation of her bank and funding system than to any other cause. These, like his corresponding systems, had been originally formed for the accomplishment of imme diate and limited objects. His Avere avowedly to revive and to uphold our sinking public credit; theirs, to relieve the government established by the Revolution of 1688 from its dependence upon the landed aristocracy for its revenues, and to secure the acquisition of ample means to defray the expenses of the war in which England was at the time involved. From such beginnings these principal measures, aided by kindred and affiliated establishments of which they Avere the parents, had with astonishing rapidity developed a great political power in the state, soon and ever since distinguished from its associates in the govern ment of the country as the Money Poaver, \u2014 a power destined to produce greater changes in the workings of the English system than had been accomplished by the Revolu tion itself. The rival powers of the state had down to that period consisted of the crown and the landed aristocracy. The measures out of which the money power was constructed were designed, as has been stated, to render the former, restored to greater favor with the nation by the Revolution, 11"], [184, "162 POLITICAL PARTIES more independent of the latter than it had hitherto been. This neAv poAver had not only performed its duty in that regard, acting in the capacity of umpire between the croAvn and the landed aristocracy, (the latter before so omnipotent,) but had at times found itself able to control the action of both through the influence of public opinion, to which it had given a vitality and force it never before possessed. Mr. Bancroft, in his able history of the United States, has given a condensed and I have no doubt a very correct account of the rise and of a part of the progress of the money power in England, as they are presented by her historians. His entire remarks upon the subject are full of interest aud instruction, and I regret that I am obliged to restrict myself to the following extract : \u2014 \" Moreover, as the expenses of wars soon exceeded the revenue of England, the government prepared to avail itself of the largest credit which, not the accumulations of wealth only, but the floating credits of commerce, and the funding sys tem could supply. The price of such aid AAras political influence. That the government should, as its paramount policy, promote commerce, domestic manufactures, and a favorable balance of trade ; that the classes benefited by this policy should sustain the government Avith their credit and their Avealth, was the reciprocal relation and compro mise on Avhich rested the fate of parties in England. The floating credits of commerce, aided by commercial accumu lations, soon greAv powerful enough to balance the landed interest ; stock aristocracy competed with feudalism. So imposing Avas the spectacle of the introduction of the citizens and of commerce as the arbiter of alliances, the umpire of factions, the judge of war and peace, that it roused the attention of speculative men: that at last Bolingbroke, claiming to speak for the landed aristocracy, described his opponents, the Whigs, as the party of the"], [185, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 163 banks, the commercial corporations, and ' in general, the moneyed interest ; ' and the gentle Addison, espousing the cause of the burghers, declares nothing to be more reason able than that ' those who have engrossetl the riches of the nation should have the management of its public treasure, and the direction of its fleets and armies.' In a word the old English aristocracy Avas compelled to respect the innovating element embodied in the moneyed interest.\" 1 The full establishment here of a similar power, by at taching to the bank and funding systems the political influence they had acquired in England, was, beyond all doubt, the \" other and still other stages of improvement \" alluded to by Hamilton in his encouraging conversation with Jefferson, in Avhich he expressed a hope, for the first time, that the inadequacy of the Constitution might yet be overcome, and the necessity of returning to the English form be at least postponed. That the leading supporters of his policy at least understood and entered into Hamil ton's views Avill be seen in the following extract from a let ter Avritten to him by Fisher Ames, which Avill be found in the first volume of Randall's \" Life of Jefferson,\" at p. 638 : \" All the influence of the moneyed men ought to be wrapped up in the Union (Federal Government) and in one Bank,\" &c. Of the three great elements of power under the Eng lish system \u2014 the crown, the landed aristocracy, and the moneyed interest \u2014 Hamilton regarded the latter, I have no doubt, as ihe most salutary even in England. There Avas little in the pride, pomp, and circumstance of the kingly office, and still less in the feudal grandeur of a landed aristocracy, to captivate a mind like his ; he advo cated the monarchical form for special reasons of a very different character, and these he assigned in the Conven- 1 3 Bancroft's History of the United States, p. 8."], [186, "164 POLITICAL PARTIES tion. Indeed, he all but expressed this preference Avhen he said to John Adams, \u2014 \"Strike out of the English system its corruptions and you make the government an imprac ticable machine.\" Corruption in some form being the means by Avhich the money power ordinarily exerts its in fluence, Hamilton Avas not slow in foreseeing the advan tages to be derived from that poAver in the United States. It is true that the influence it exerted in England Avas liberal in its character, and beneficial, at least in its political bearings, to the middle classes. We have seen that one object and a principal effect of its establishment AA-as to re duce the overshadowing influence of the landed aristocracy which existed so long and exerted a SAvay so imperious over the country \u2014 an object in the accomplishment of which the members of the \" stock aristocracy \" Avere, in all probability, not a little stimulated by recollections of their past exclusions not only from all participation in the management of public affairs, but also from many social distinctions. The landed aristocracy of England is com posed of a race of men superior in manly virtues and consistency of character to similar classes in other coun tries, but notAvithstanding these undeniable and commend able traits they are, by force of their condition and by the law of their minds, in a great degree the result of that condition, unwilling to extend to their unprivileged fellow subjects that equality in public and private rights to which we republicans consider them justly entitled. In this re spect there is no difference between them, be they Whigs or Tories, \u2014 their first duty being, in the estimation of both, to \" stand by their order.\" It is equally true that it did not comport Avith Hamilton's policy to promote the estab lishment of any poAver here the influence of which Avould enure to the increase and security of political poAver in the people, and that, to answer his purposes, the results of the"], [187, "Ds THE UNITED STATES. 165 operations of the money poAver here must be the reverse of what they Avere in England. He was too Avell versed in politics and parties not to know that the action of every political organization in a state takes its direction from the character and condition of its principal rival, and that all have their rivals. If one is not found to exist they will soon make one, for such is the natural operation of political parties in any degree free. We differed greatly from England in the condition and political aspect of affairs ; we had no monarchical institu tions, no landed aristocracy to excite the rivalry and oppo sition of the money power. It Avas itself, on the contrary, destined, Avhen firmly established, to become Avhatever of aristocracy could co-exist with our political system. Its natural antagonist Avould be the democratic spirit of the country, \u2014 that spirit which had been the lion in Hamilton's path from the beginning, the dread of which had destroyed his usefulness and blasted the fair prospects that Avere pre sented to the youthful patriot, \u2014 that spirit Avhich h\u00ab doubt less sincerely believed adverse to order, and destitute of due respect for the rights of property. It was to keep down this spirit that he desired the establishment of a money power here which should stand by the Government as its interested ally, and support it against popular dis affection and tumult. He Avell understood that, if he accomplished that desire, they AA'ould soon become the principal antagonistic influences on our political stage. He knew also, what was not less satisfactory to his feelings, that if the anticipations, not to say hopes, which he never ceased to entertain, should be realized, of the presentation of a fair opportunity for the introduction of his favorite institutions Avithout too great a shock to public feeling, there could be no class of men Avho Avould be better dis posed to second his views than those whose power in the"], [188, "166 POLITICAL PARTIES state he had so largely contributed to establish. To be allied to power, permanent, if possible, in its character and splendid in its appendages, is one of the strongest passions which wealth inspires. The grandeur of the Crown and of the landed aristocracy affords a fair vent to that in Eng land. Here, where it is deprived of that indulgence, it maintains a constant struggle for the establishment of a moneyed oligarchy, the most selfish and monopolizing of all depositories of political poAver, and is only prevented from realizing its complete designs by the democratic spirit of the country. Hamilton succeeded for a season in all his wishes. He established the money power upon precisely the same foundations upon which it had been raised in England. He founded a political school the implied alliance between which and the Government was similar to that which Avas formed between the money power in England and the Revolutionary Government in 16S8. A party adhering inflexibly to the leading principle of that school had sur vived his own overthrow, is still in existence, and will con tinue to exist as long as ours remains a free Government, and as long as the characters and dispositions of men re main Avhat they are. To combat the democratic spirit of the country Avas the object of its original establishment, an object which it has pursued with unflagging diligence, by whatever name it may have been designated. Having brought the general subject to this point it is due to truth and justice that I should, before I proceed farther, refer to considerations connected with Hamilton's motives which have been already but casually and partially noticed. In all his steps he was doubtless influenced at bottom by a sincere desire to promote the good of his country, and as little by personal vieAvs as ordinarily falls to the lot of"], [189, "167 IN THE UNITED STATES. man. A riveted conviction that the masses were destitute of a sufficient love of order and respect for private rights, with an entire distrust, consequently, of their capacity for self-government, lay at the foundation of his whole course, \u2014 a course Avhich the matured judgment of the country has definitively condemned as to both teacher and doctrine. Subsequent experience of long duration has shown, as I have remarked already, that the dispositions of our people are eminently conservative in respect to public order and the rights of property ; exceptions to the general rule have been witnessed here as Avell as elsewhere, but they have been of very limited duration and seldom the cause of much mischief. There have been few if any countries that have been more fortunate in this regard. I have also spoken of Hamilton's preference for mon archical institutions, upon evidence of which I have not felt myself at liberty to doubt. But it is due to the memory of that distinguished man that Ave should speak of his dis position in that respect with more precision than might be deemed necessary in other cases. To assume that he was a friend to monarchy as it existed in England in the times of the Stuarts and their predecessors Avould be doing him gross injustice. No man in the country, in his day, re spected less the absurd dogma of the divine right of kings, or regarded with more contempt the reverence paid by gaping crowds to the pomp and pageantry of royalty and to the carefully guarded relics and reliquaries of the hoar institution of monarchy, than Alexander Hamilton. He Avas, beyond all doubt, entirely sincere Avhen he said, in the Federal Convention, that he \" Avas as zealous an ad vocate for liberty as any man Avhatsoever, and trusted he would be as willing- a martyr to it, though he differed as to the form in which it Avas most eligible ; \" and had he been a felloAv-subject and contemporary of Russell, and"], [190, "168 POLITICAL PARTIES Sydney, and Hampden, we may believe that he Avould have proved himself as prompt as either to make sacrifices equal to theirs in resistance to arbitrary power. Expecta tions of personal advantages through the favor of royalty did not enter into the formation of his opinions. It was monarchy as modified and re-established by the Revo lution of 1688 that was the object of Hamilton's prefer ence. In the same speech from Avhich I have just quoted he gave Avith manly candor his reasons for believing that the English model presented the fairest chance of any system then extant for the selection of a good executive. He contrasted the probable advantages in this regard between a chief magistrate selected, in the first instance, by Parliament and continued by descent, aud one elected by the people for a limited period, and frankly argued in favor of the former. His opinion Avas mainly control led by that AA-ant of confidence in the capacity of the people for self-government Avhich he never hesitated to acknowledge, and which, as I have said, lay at the founda tion of his political views. But it Avas not the king, as such, that he sought after, but a competent chief magis trate ; and he advocated monarchical institutions only be cause he thought them the most likely to produce such an one. In a speech delivered by him in the New York Ratification Convention, which bears the stamp of his OAvn revision, he said, \" It is an undeniable truth that the body of the people in eA'ery country sincerely desire its pros perity, but it is equally unquestionable that they do not possess the discernment and stability necessary for sys tematic government.\" He never exhibited a preference for monarchy in the abstract ; no one ever heard him ex press a partiality for or an attachment to this or that royal family save as their acts Avere more or less meritorious, aud I cannot think that such considerations ever swayed"], [191, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 169 his course.

Their arraignment and vindica- tion brought into the political field the ablest men of the country at a period when she abounded in great men. The American Revolution accomplished here that which the French Revolution, then at its commencement, and similar crises in all countries and times, have brought about, namely, the production of great men by great events, de veloping and calling into action upon a large scale intel lects the powers of which, but for their application to great transactions, might have remained unknoAvn alike to their"], [194, "172 POLITICAL PARTIES possessors and to the world. Among the master minds Avhich Avere thus roused to political activity were Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, Patrick Henry, John and Samuel Adams, John Jay, Chancellor Livingston, Gouverneur Morris, George Clinton, Robert Yates, Chancellor Lansing, John Langdon, Elbridge Gerry, Rufus King, Roger Sherman, John Dickinson, Speight and Williamson and the Rutledges, Pinckneys, and Middletons of North and South Carolina, Chace and Luther Martin of Maryland, Jackson, FeAV, and Baldwin, of Georgia, John Mason, Marshall, Pendleton, and Wythe of Virginia, and others ; men, some of whom have under various circumstances added celebrity to the best informed communities in the Avorld and at one of the brightest periods of the human intellect, and Avho, if they could now be congregated, would eclipse the great men of any country. Hamilton's measures, of Avhich the funding system was the pioneer, presented their first field, after the adoption of the Federal Constitution, for the display of their opinions and talents. They supported in those grave discussions, Avith few exceptions, relatively the same principles by Avhich they had been influenced in respect to federal poli tics during the government of the Confederation, by which also they and men of their stamp had been gov erned under the colonial system, and to Avhich they Avould have adhered, in all probability, throughout the interme diate period if they had not been driven into open rebellion by the indiscriminate and intolerable oppression of a big oted tyrant, and by their OAvn innate hatred of wrong and outrage, Avithout immediate regard to the government that should result from their revolution. Jefferson AA'as absent from the country during a large portion of the government of the Confederation, and"], [195, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 173 through the entire period of the formation and adoption of the new Constitution. He sympathized throughout Avith the feelings and concurred in the opinions of the Anti- Federal party, Avith the exceptions that he Avas not opposed to conferring on the Federal Government the powers to regulate commerce and to raise its own revenues ; Avas in favor of a convention for the construction of a new constitution, and of the formation by that body of a substantive and effective federal government, composed of legislative, executive, and judicial departments ; approved of the Constitution as made, Avith modifications which were principally provided for by amendments proposed and adopted, and Avas sincerely anxious for its ratification. These things have, I know, been controverted and are still disbelieA'ed by many, but will be found fully established by references to the following documents, viz. : Jefferson's \"Correspondence,\" Vol. I. p. 441 ; Vol. II. pp. 64, 162, 221, 236, 273, 303 ; Letter to Washington expressing his anxiety for the adoption of the Constitution ; p. 310, some strong remarks in favor of it ; p. 342, to Madison, congratulating him on its adoption, and p. 348, to John Jay, to the same effect. Of Madison's character and general course I have already spoken. His position at the period now under consideration differed from that of all his contemporaries in the public service. He had supported all the commer cial and financial measures advocated by the Federal party during the government of the Confederation, and had been as active, and I think as efficient, as Hamilton in his efforts to promote the call of the Federal Convention ; had opposed, with ability and firmness, the Anti-Federal plan of a Constitution ; had, as far as Ave have knowledge of Washington's opinions, acted in concert with him in the Convention, and Avas first selected by him at a later period"], [196, "174 POLITICAL PARTIES to prepare his Farewell Address ; had combined his labors with those of Hamilton and Jay to promote the ratification of the Constitution by the well-knoAvn papers of the \"Fed eralist,\" and, upon the Avhole, had done more than any other man to secure that great object. Yet there had been no time, as before observed, when he could with propriety have been regarded as a member of the Federal party, in the sense in which Hamilton, Adams, and Jay Avere so re garded, or when he did not possess the confidence of the Anti-Federal party, in respect to all public questions other than those to which I have referred, and, Avhat is still more remarkable, there was not, during the Avhole of this period, a single occasion on which his perfect probity and disinterestedness were not very generally felt and acknowl edged. Among the leading politicians of the epoch of which I speak, the preponderance in numbers, in wealth, in social position, and possibly in talent, Avas on the side of Ham ilton ; and when to these Avere added the commercial and numerous other classes interested in and dependent upon the money power, then just rising into importance, an estimate may be formed of his ability to give tone and direction to the state and to society, and to cover with odium those who disapproved of his measures by charging them with personal hostility to Washington, who so well deserved the confidence and good will of all, and Avho en joyed them to an extent that led John Adams, at a much later day, to stigmatize the deference paid to him as \" impious homage.\" Hamilton wielded this great poAver with tremendous effect, for, although his judgment in the management of men was always deemed defective, he exerted, in the promotion of his particular objects, talents and industry which could not fail to produce great results. His activity and capacity for labor were not equaled by"], [197, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 175 any of his contemporaries save Madison ; his powers of persuasion and the effects of his eloquence were strikingly exemplified by his success in making Mr. Jefferson believe, on his first arrival at the seat of government from France, that the safety of the Union depended upon the passage of the bill for the assumption of the State debts, which had been at the moment rejected in the House of Representa tives by a majority of one or two, and in inducing him to \" hold the candle,\" as Jefferson afterwards described it, to a bargain by which Messrs. White and Lee, Southern members, Avere prevailed upon to vote for its reconsidera tion and passage on condition that Hamilton would get the requisite number of Northern members to vote for the establishment of the seat of the Federal GoA-ernment on slave territory. Jefferson gives an interesting account of the earnestness of Hamilton's appeal to him on the subject, and of his own mortification and regret at having been made a party to so exceptionable a transaction in support of a measure he soon found the strongest reasons to con demn.1 The attention of every American community which pos sessed facilities for foreign commerce or manufactures, or for any of the A'arious pursuits enumerated in his great report, and especially Avhen they possessed also superior skill and enterprise, was at once directed to Hamilton's scheme of government for encouragement, and they cer tainly were not aUvays indisposed to accept the seductive offers held out to them. But fortunately for the country and for the cause of good government there Avas a class, happily formidable in numbers and in great and sterling qualities, whom no wiles could Avin from their devotion to early principles and whom government favors could not corrupt. That class was, singularly enough, the landed 1 Jefferson's Correspondence, Vol. 4, p. 449. 1"], [198, "176 POLITICAL PARTIES interest. I say singularly, not because their fidelity to principle Avas at variance with their history, but with refer ence to the circumstance that, whilst in England it had been the principal object in building up the money power to restrict the influence of the lauded interest, that power Avas here destined to be itself kept in check by an interest of the same name, however different in character. Mr. Jefferson in his celebrated letter to Mazzei, in 1796, gives a description, Avhich could not be improved, of the then political condition of the country and of its political parties : \" Against us,\" he says, \" are the executive, the judiciary, tAvo out of three branches of the Legislature, all the officers of the Government, all who Avant to be officers, all timid men Avho prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty, British merchants and Americans trading on British capital, speculators and holders in the banks and public funds, \u2014 a contrivance invented for the purpose of corruption, and for assimilating us in all things to the rotten as well as the sound parts of the British model. The whole body of our citizens, how ever, remain true to their republican principles ; the whole landed interest is republican, and so is a great mass of talent.\" The term \" landed interest \" in its general sig nification, and in the sense in Avhich it was used by Mr. Jefferson, referred to those Avho worked as Avell as owned the land, \u2014 the farmers of the North and the planters of the South, \u2014 all Avho made Agriculture their pursuit ; a class which in the earlier periods of our colonial condition constituted almost our entire population, and have at every period in our history vastly exceeded in numbers those engaged in all other pursuits. There is no point of re semblance betAveen them and the landed aristocracy of England, save in that they both represent the landed inter est of their respective countries and that they A\\-ere led in \u25a0\u25a0"], [199, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 177 each to oppose the money power. Their difference in other respects is sufficiently manifest. A more estimable class of men than the farmers and planters of the United States is not to be found in the world. From the landing of the Pilgrims to the present day they have exerted an effective and salutary influence, not only upon the condition of the country, in respect to its material improvement, but upon the character and strength of our political institutions. It was to their sa gacity and firmness that the colonies were chiefly indebted for their success in turning away and defeating the fury of the savages, and in baffling the persevering efforts of the mother country to enslave the provinces. For the most part the descendants of ancestors Avho had been, to an almost unprecedented extent, exposed to the faithless ness and persecutions of power, they seldom failed to be on their guard against its approaches, hoAvever artfully dis guised. Every attempt to purchase their acquiescence in measures that they regarded as encroachments upon their liberties or subversive of their rights, through govern mental favors, proved abortive. Grenville, when pressed, as prime minister, by the London merchants Avith the dangers that threatened the collection of their American debts from the effects of the stamp-tax, Avas prodigal in his offers of governmental favors to secure the submission of the colonists to the odious measure. \" If one bounty,\" said he, \" will not do, I Avill add two; if two Avill not do, I will add three.\" But these offers, as Avell as all the efforts Avhich had been and Avere subsequently made by the Crown to quiet the Colonies through bounties and commercial privileges, were unavail ing. The \" landed interest,\" constituting a great majority of the colonists, Avas too Avise to be duped, and too honest to be corrupted, by special favors of any description. 12"], [200, "178 POLITICAL PARTIES Placed by the nature of their pursuits, in a great measure, beyond the reach of court and official blandishments, and less dependent on the special privileges of the Crown than those who looked to them for their support, they uniformly regarded these offers Avith distrust rather than desire. They had, from these and other considerations, been led to embrace the principles upon Avhich the Revolution Avas founded with more earnestness, and to cherish them Avith a more uncalculating devotion, than many of their Revolu tionary associates. The circumstance that a larger share of the defense of those principles had devolved upon them, by reason of the excess of their numbers, naturally com mended more warmly to their hearts doctrines for the establishment of which they had suffered so much inquie tude and encountered so many perils. These considerations Avere alike applicable to, and equally influential upon, the landed interest of the North and of the South. With attachments undiminished and unchangeable to republican principles, pure and simple, subject to such limitations only as were required by convenience in their execution and necessary to deliberation in council, prin ciples the fruition of which had been the day-dream of their ancestors through successive generations, and their own guiding-star in the gloomiest period of the Revolu tion, the representatives of this great interest, North and South, by large majorities, sustained the Anti-Federal party until that party was overthrown through its great error in respect to the Constitution, aud were still ready to take their stand in any organization that should have for its object opposition to the heresies developed by Hamilton in his platform for the government of the administration. The principles upon Avhich the landed interest acted from the start, have, it must be admitted, been more successfully sustained in the Southern than in the Northern States \u25a0"], [201, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 179 not because they were originally embraced Avith more sin cerity, but from very different causes. The commercial, manufacturing, and trading classes, to Avhom Hamilton's policy Avas more particularly addressed, and upon whom it, beyond all doubt, exerted a powerful influence, Avere, at the beginning, far more numerous in the Northern than in the Southern States, and this disparity in their respective con ditions has been constantly increasing. It was through the growing poAver of these classes, and of others similarly, though perhaps not equally, exposed to its influence, that the Hamiltonian policy occasionally triumphed in the Northern States, and their politics thus became more unstable than those of the South. Mr. Bancroft happily and truly describes the pecu liar condition of Southern men in this regard. \" An instinctive aversion,\" says he, \"to too much government was always a trait of Southern character expressed in the solitary manner of settling iu the country, in the absence of municipal governments, in the indisposition of the scat tered inhabitants to engage in commerce, to collect in towns, or to associate in townships under corporate poAvers. As a consequence there was little commercial industry ; and on the soil of Virginia there were no vast accumula tions of commercial wealth. The exchanges were made almost entirely \u2014 and it continued so for more than a cen tury \u2014 by factors of foreign merchants. Thus the influence of wealth, under the modern form of stocks and accumula tions of money, was ahvays inconsiderable; and men were so Avidely scattered \u2014 like hermits among the heathen \u2014 that far the smallest number were within the reach of the direct influence of the established Church or of Govern ment.\" * In this description of the early, which is also measur- 1 Bancroft's Hist. United States, Vol. II. p. 189."], [202, "180 POLITICAL PARTIES ably and comparatively true of the present, state of the South, we find a solution of the circumstance that the fail ure of Hamilton's policy Avas so much more signal there than in other quarters, and that the principles upon Avhich it was sounded have there been since so perseveringly and unitedly resisted. The political principles of the landed interest, constituting an immense majority of their people, have prevailed in the administration of their State govern ments, save in regard to the ratification of the Federal Constitution, from the recognition of our Independence to the present day. There has also been a remarkable con sistency in the political positions of their public men. In Virginia, Avhich State has done so much to give a tone to national politics, Patrick Henry has been almost, if not quite, the only prominent man Avho abandoned the prin ciples by which he had been governed during the Con federation, and embraced those of Hamilton at the coming in of the new government. Always admiring his char acter and conduct during the Revolutionary era, and strongly impressed by the vehemence and consistency with which he had, during the goA'ernment of the Confedera tion, opposed every measure that savored of English ori gin, I pressed Mr. Jefferson, as far as Avas allowable, for the reasons of his sudden and great change. His explana tion was, \"that Henry had been smitten by Hamilton's financial policy.\" The Republican party, forced into existence by Hamil ton's obnoxious measures, sprang chiefly from the landed interest. The declaration of its illustrious founder, in his letter to Mazzei, that the country would yet preserve its liberties, Avas mainly based on the fact that \" the whole landed interest was republican,\" and he could not have placed his reliance on a surer foundation. Farthest re moved, as has been already said, from the seductive influ-"], [203, "W THE UNITED STATES. 181 ence of the money power, abounding in strong common sense and love of country, and always greatly superior in numbers to the business men of all other classes, it consti tuted then, and has ever since constituted, the balance Avheel of the Government. All it asks from administration is the maintenance of order, protection in the enjoyment of its civil and political rights, and the management of public affairs in a spirit of equal justice to all men. Whilst the commercial and manufacturing classes are annually ap proaching the National Legislature Avith appeals for aid and encouragement, and whilst the Congressional com mittees charged with their interests are from time to time convulsing the country with their measures, that which is nominally the representative and guardian of agriculture not being asked to do any thing for its support, very prop erly does nothing ; having, indeed, no poAver under the Constitution to do any thing for it, the advantages of which are not common to all classes. What the farmers and planters desire more than this are \" the early and the latter rain,\" for which they look to a source purer and more powerful than human legislation. Thus sustained, the Republican party of 1790, headed by Thomas Jefferson, with the ' laboring oar ' in the hands of James Madison, Avarmed into action by Jefferson's mere fervent though not more deeply seated patriotism, and em bracing \" a great mass of talent,\" determined to oppose every measure of Washington's administration which they believed to be unauthorized by the Constitution, or anti republican in its tendencies. This resolution Avas carried out Avith unflinching firmness, but, Avhatever has been said to the contrary, was made and designed to be performed in a manner consistent with the respect they entertained for the character and feelings of President Washington, and Avithout even a desire to displace him from the high"], [204, "182 POLITICAL PARTIES office AA'ith which they had contributed to invest him. It would have been strange if, in a state of party violence so excited as that Avhich naturally sprung up, the dominant party should have refrained from aspersing the motives of their opponents by attributing to them personal hostility to a chief so justly beloved by the people as was Washing ton. Mr. Jefferson, in his letter to me, referring to similar charges but speaking of a subsequent period, says : \" Gen eral Washington, after the retirement of his first cabinet and the composition of his second, entirely Federal, and at the head of Avhich Avas Mr. Pickering himself, had no opportunity of hearing both sides of any question. His measures consequently took more the hue of the party in whose hands he was. These measures were certainly not approved by the Republicans ; yet they Avere not imputed to him, but to the counselors around him ; and his pru dence so far restrained their impassioned course and bias that no act of strong mark during the remainder of his administration excited much dissatisfaction. He lived too short a time after, and too much AvithdraAvn from informa tion to correct the views into Avhich he had been deluded, and the continued assiduities of the party drew him into the vortex of their intemperate career, separated him still farther from his real friends, and excited him to actions and expressions of dissatisfaction which grieved them but could not loosen their affections from him.\" : Such charges were freely made and with unsparing bitterness; yet I cannot but think that unprejudiced minds, if it is not too soon to expect to find many such upon this subject, would, on a careful review of facts, acquit the Republican party of them. Madcaps, and those who, looking to party for their daily bread, hope to commend themselves by extremes and by violence to those whom 1 See Appendix."], [205, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 183 they sustain, are to be found in all parties and should not be allowed to make those to which they attach themselves responsible for their acts. Nothing has ever been adduced that may fairly be regarded as the act of the Republican party Avhich proves the existence of the disposition charged against it in regard to General Washington ; and the single fact that, although its opposition commenced three years before the expiration of his first term, there was not the slightest effort made to prevent his re-election, or the ex hibition of any desire to prevent it, is, of itself, sufficient to refute the charge of personal unfriendliness toward him. Nor did the Republicans desire to embarrass his administration beyond what was inevitable from their oppo sition to measures Avhich they regarded as unconstitutional or in the highest degree inexpedient, of which the bank and funding system Avere appropriate illustrations. The Federal party, without extraordinary or difficult attention and care, might have preserved untarnished a character made respectable by illustrious names and honor able history, notwithstanding the overwhelming defeat to which it was subsequently exposed, and its principles, how ever erroneous, might have stood a chance of restoration to power in the course of those changes and overturns of men and things to which public affairs and political parties have ever been subject. Even error of opinion not un frequently regains a lost ascendency by means of the perseverance and consistency with Avhich it is adhered to, and when the organization by Avhich it has been upheld is maintained Avith the fidelity and dignity that belong to a good cause. In all these respects there was, on the part of the members of the Federal party, a complete failure. They suffered its lead to fall into less respectable hands, and its support to be lent to seceders (one after another)"], [206, "184 POLITICAL PARTIES from the Republican ranks between whom and themselves there was no identity of political feeling, and still less of principle. The motives for this course Avere usually censur able, and the results generally disastrous from the begin ning, and always so in the sequel. Hamilton, as has been seen, twice threw himself in the path of his party to save it from such degradation, for his intelligence and integrity appreciated the impossibility of preserving the respect of the people at large for principles, whose special advocates showed by their acts that they did not themselves respect them. His counsels were unheeded, and the banner of a once highly honored party continued to be trailed in the dust until its name was disowned by its adherents with shame and disgust. Those who agree with me in believing that General Hamilton was sincere in the opinion he expressed that the republican system could not be made adequate to the pur-: pose of good government here, and that the welfare of the country would be best promoted by approaching as near to the English model as public sentiment Avould tolerate, are well justified in holding him undeserving of censure for his introduction of the anti-republican plan which he sub mitted to the Federal Convention. The right of the people to \" alter or abolish \" existing systems, and \" to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness,\" Avas the corner-stone of the Revolution, in defense of which he had freely ventured his life. The Convention was not only an appropriate but the appointed place for the assertion and exercise of that right. So far from being a fit subject for censure, the submission to that body by a man in Ham ilton's position, Avith the claims he had established upon"], [207, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 185 the confidence and support of the people by his superior abilities and his Revolutionary services, of propositions which every body knew, and which he himself felt, were strongly adA'erse to the prevailing current of public senti ment, and the intrepidity and extraordinary talent with which he sustained them, without a single open supporter in the Convention, solely because he believed them to be right and their adoption necessary to the public good, ex hibited a patriotic and self-sacrificing spirit alike honorable to himself and to his principles. His course in the Con vention, for Avhich he has been extensively reviled, was in my judgment the most brilliant and creditable portion of his political career. It presented an example of candor and devotion to principle Avhich there was not a single one among his friends willing to follow, although there were, doubtless, a few who felt substantially as he did and sympathized with all he said, and although they all admired his gallant bearing Avhile lamenting his indis cretion. It was, unhappily for himself, the culminating point in his political life, from which every subsequent step gradually lowered him, until he justly forfeited the confi dence and countenance of every sincere friend to repub lican government. Alas ! how deeply is it to be lamented that this great statesman, as able as an impracticable man can be, when he knew that he Avas about to attempt a ladder upon the first round of Avhich his boldest friend dared not even to place his foot, had not rather followed, in some respects at least, the example of his coadjutor and friend, James Madison.

In regard to one subject a partial reference to them has already been made. They Avere co-workers in a series of efforts to obtain from the Congress of the Con federation authority for the Federal head to levy and collect impost duties to enable it to perform the offices devolved upon the General Government by the Articles of Confederation, instead of trusting to the unsafe and un stable requisitions upon the States. No sooner had the first Congress of the neAv Government, established for that and other purposes, formed a quorum, than Mr. Madison, as we have already seen, before the executive branch had been organized, or even the President elect been in formed of his election, introduced bills for the imposi tion and collection of duties on imported goods, which he pushed forward de die in diem until they became laAvs, and the duties were in the process of being collected, and the public coffers in the way of being replenished. This good work he followed up in due time by the introduction into Congress of resolutions (and the most able support of them on its floor) in favor of a commercial policy recommended by the Secretary of State, Mr. Jefferson, to improve our trade and thus increase our revenue. These were the con tributions of Mr. Madison, simple, practical, and direct like their author, for promoting the financial branch of the pub lic service under the new Government, which was com mitted by President Washington to the special superintend ence of Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary's contributions to the same objects con sisted of two very elaborate and very able reports, the first upon public credit, recommending the establishment of a funding system, and the second in favor of a national bank, embracing plans for each and. in the former, a scheme to"], [209, "187 IN THE UNITED STATES. raise funds for the payment of the interest of a debt to be funded. The eclat which he acquired by these imposing state papers Avas so great, and many minds are still so much dazzled by the traditional splendor of their effects upon the credit and resources of the country as to render it not a little embarrassing to discuss, in a plain, matter of-fact way, the questions of their real influence or non influence upon our finances. In previous as well as in subsequent parts of this work will be found notices of the rise, progress, and effects of Hamilton's funding system, which, if they do not show that the measure, judged by its results, partook more of the character of a castle in the air than of a wise and practicable financial scheme, do not, I think, fall far short of it. But both it and the bank are now only \" obsolete ideas\" \u2014 to remain so probably while our Government endures. References, under such circumstances, can only be usefully made to them to show the principles and objects of men and parties. Whilst Hamilton's measures have been, it is hoped and believed, forever abandoned \u2014 the funding system by his own political friends, and a national bank in conse quence of its explicit and emphatic condemnation by the whole country \u2014 those put into immediate and successful operation by Madison not only performed at the time the useful office designed for them by the Constitution, and gradually provided for the Avants of the existing Govern ment, but have supplied it Avith a revenue abundantly suf ficient to pay the public debt and to defray all expenses and disbursements required by the public service in war and in peace, with rare and limited additions, for nearly three quarters of a century, and will, in all likelihood, con tinue so to do to the end."], [210, "188 POLITICAL PARTIES But the most interesting aspect of these coincidences and contrasts to Avhich I refer is to be found in the illus trations they furnish of the use and abuse of the Constitu tion by those distinguished men and by their followers respectively. Co-workers again in persevering efforts to obtain from Congress or the States a call for a general convention to revise the Articles of Confederation, it Avould be difficult to decide which contributed most to effect that object, and it is not too much to say that it Avould not have been then accomplished if the efforts of either had been withheld. They were neither of them satisfied with the Constitution framed by the Convention ; Madison not en tirely, Hamilton scarcely at all. The former sympathized, as I have already said, with Hamilton's distrust of the State governments, made unsuccessful efforts to impose stringent restrictions upon their power, and would have been better pleased Avith the Constitution if it had inclined more decidedly in that direction. They both signed the instrument notwithstanding; Ham ilton under a sort of protest against its sufficiency (or rather its want of it), and Madison with apparent and, I doubt not, real cordiality. In the numbers of the \" Federalist,\" (of which they were the principal authors,) they offered a joint and honorable testimonial to the Constitution, which became in the sequel an enduring monument to their OAvn associated memories. Each rendered \" yeoman's service \" in the conventions, respectively, of New York and Vir ginia, to decide upon its ratification ; in neither of Avhich was the ratification probable at the beginning, and in both there is the best reason to believe that, without their pow erful aid, it must have ultimately failed. In such an event the failure of the Constitution would have been next to certain. Although Gouverneur Morris's assertion that Hamilton"], [211, "IS THE UNITED STATES. 189 had comparatively nothing to do Avith the construction of the Federal Constitution is true, yet as Madison had a greater agency in that work than any other individual, and as the obtaining the call of the Convention and the ratification of the Constitution, in which Madison and Hamilton acted the chief parts, were also the portions of the Avhole transaction most exposed to the action of the States and of the public mind, and therefore the most dif ficult of accomplishment, it may with truth be affirmed that there Avere not any fifty or a hundred other men taken together to Avhom the country Avas as much indebted for the Federal Constitution as to those two gentlemen. But in their subsequent treatment of that sacred instrument, which each had done so much to bring to maturity, they, unfortunately for the country, differed very Avidely. The Constitution was ratified and adopted in the first instance by more than the requisite number of States, and finally by the Avhole thirteen. General Washington was elected President. He appointed Alexander Hamilton to be Sec retary of the Treasury, and James Madison was elected a member of the first Congress. The latter, although over ruled in the Convention upon points Avhich he deemed im portant, acquiesced in the decisions of the majority, ac cepted the Constitution in good faith Avith a determination to do all in his power, not only to secure its ratification, but to give to the people and the States the full benefit of its provisions as those were understood by them, and to do this with the same fidelity and honor with which he would perform any private arrangement to which he had made himself a party. Satisfied from numerous exhibitions of public sentiment elsewhere as well as in the State conven tions, and perhaps more particularly in that of his own State, not only that there was far greater opposition in the minds of the people at large to the Constitution as it came"], [212, "190 POLITICAL PARTIES from the hands of the Convention than he at first sup posed, but that it was, in point of fact, defective in some particulars important in themselves and Avell calculated to excite the solicitude of the masses, he determined to leave no means within his reach unimproved to make it, by suit able and seasonable amendments, what a brief experience convinced him that it ought to be. It might perhaps be inferred, from some general expressions used by him in the first Congress, that he felt as if something had been said or done on his part rendering his attention to this matter a special duty, although nothing of that nature is apparent; but, be that as it may, there were other considerations im perative upon a mind so circumspect and so just to prevent his losing sight of the subject. Mr. John Quincy Adams asserts that the Constitution \" Avas extorted from the grinding necessity of a reluctant nation.\" Although this may be deemed an exaggerated description no one can make himself familiar with the his tory of that period without becoming sensible of the truth of two positions, viz. : that vast numbers Avho Avere greatly dissatisfied Avith the Constitution were induced to withhold their active opposition by the embarrassed condition of the country, and that even this consideration Avould not have sufficed to overcome the decided Anti-Federal majority against it but for the provision authorizing amendments, and the confident anticipation that such as Avere proper and necessary would be speedily made. The consciousness of these truths, and a conviction that a successful operation of, and general acquiescence in, the provisions of the new Constitution were not to be expected unless proper steps were immediately taken to appease the opposition still in force among the Anti-Federalists, secured the early and unremitting attention of Mr. Madison to that point. This view of the expectations of the country upon the"], [213, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 191 subject of amendment and of the condition of the public mind in respect to it Avas strongly confirmed by memorials presented to the first Congress, at its first session, by the States of NeAv York and Virginia, containing averments framed in the strongest terms, that Avhilst they dreaded the operation of the Constitution in its then imperfect state, they had, notwithstanding, yielded their assent to its ratifi cation from motives of affection for their sister States, aud from an invincible reluctance to separate from them, and with a full confidence that its imperfections would be speedily removed ; that the existence of great and vital defects iu the Constitution was the prevailing conviction of those States ; that the dissatisfaction and uneasiness upon the subject amongst their people would never cease to dis tract the country until the causes of them were satisfactorily removed ; that the matter Avould ill admit of postponement, and concluding Avith applications to Congress that they should, Avithout delay, call a new convention with full pow ers to revise and amend the Constitution. Although these memorials referred to the opinions expressed by their re spective State conventions that that instrument ought to undergo further revision, AA'hich, in one of them, was a unanimous expression, Congress nevertheless took no steps toward a compliance Avith the request they contained. But the whole subject was brought before it by Mr. Madison as soon as he had perfected his revenue measures, and he caused amendments to be carried through that body, I had almost said by his OAvn unaided efforts, which AA-ere satis factory to the people \u2014 certainly to that portion of them by whom the Constitution had been opposed. A tolerably full and obviously fair account of the de bates and proceedings in the House of Representatives upon this subject \u2014 those in the Senate, I fear, are lost \u2014 may be found in the first and second volumes of Lloyd's"], [214, "192 POLITICAL PARTIES \" Register of the Proceedings and Debates of the First House of Representatives of the United States,\" which I am sorry to find has not been transferred to Colonel Ben ton's \" Abridgment.\" The subject, speaking of the ten amendments as one measure, was only second in intrinsic importance, on account of the influence its success exerted on the solidity and perpetuity of the neAv system, to the Constitution itself, and the debates in point of ability and earnestness, particularly on the part of Mr. Madison, not inferior to any of the discussions by Avhich that interesting period Avhen the foundations of the present government Avere laid Avas so greatly distinguished ; one cannot read them Avithout acknowledging the difficulty of recalling another instance in Avhich a measure of equal gravity was so successfully carried through a public body against the obvious and decided preferences of a large majority of its members, or without admiring the extent to Avhich that success Avas achieA'ed by the exertions of one man. Now that the dangers Avhich environed these proceed ings have passed aAvay, they afford amusement to the curious in such matters by the picture they furnish of the twists and turns to Avhich men in high positions and of generally fair vieAvs will sometimes resort to stave off dis tasteful propositions, Avith the hope of ultimately defeat ing what they do not feel it to be safe directly to oppose. The Virginia and New York applications were presented by Mr. Bland, of the former, and Mr. Lawrence, of the latter State, both friends of Hamilton ; and although both were solicitous that the applications should be respectfully received, neither of them ever took a step to make them successful, nor Avere they in favor of the amendments pro posed by Mr. Madison. That gentleman gave notice of his intention to bring the subject before the House several Aveeks before the day he named for that purpose. When"], [215, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 193 that day arrived he moved that the House should resolve itself into a committee of the whole to receive the amend ments he proposed to offer. Opposition to going into such committee came from almost all sides of the House, some urging one species of objections and some another, but generally indicative of decided unfriendliness to the views of the mover. Perceiving that his motion was neither satisfactory nor likely to succeed, Mr. Madison Avithdrew it, and submitted a proposition for the appointment of a select committee to report such amendments to the Consti tution as they should think proper. Having done this, he, in a very able speech, went over the whole subject, stated at length the necessity that existed for some amendments, and the high expediency of proposing others, and furnished a statement of those he had intended to offer to the com mittee of the Avhole ; these he trusted Avould now be re ferred to the select committee, and thus the matter Avould proceed there without interruption to the other business of the House. The proposition for a select committee Avas not more fortunate or acceptable than its predecessor. It was op posed from the same quarters, and several who had evinced no favor toward the motion to go into committee of the whole iioav said that, if the subject was to be taken up at all, that Avould have been, but for its withdrawal, the preferable mode. Mr. Madison declared himself, as he said, \" unfortunate in not satisfying gentlemen with re spect to the mode of introducing the business ; he had thought, from the dignity and peculiarity of the sub ject, that it ought to be referred to a committee of the whole ; he had accordingly made that motion first, but finding himself not likely to succeed in that way, he had changed his ground. Fearing again to be discomfited on his motion for a select committee, he would change his 13"], [216, "194 POLITICAL PARTIES mode, and move the propositions he had stated before di- rectly to the House, and it might then do what it thought proper with them. He accordingly moved the propositions by A\\'ay of Resolutions to be adopted by the House.\" This course Avas also objected to on several grounds ; but the majority saAV that if the game of staving off the subject was not broken up by Mr. Madison's third proposition, it had at least been so far exposed as to re- quire time to put it in some neAv form, and with that A'iew Mr. Lawrence, Avho, as already said, was not in favor of amendments, moved that the subject be referred to a com- mittee of the whole, \u2014 the proposition first submitted by Mr. Madison, \u2014 Avhich was done. This occurred on the 8th of June. On the 21st of July thereafter Mr. Madi- son \" begged the House to indulge him m the further con- sideration of the subject of amendments to the Constitution, and as there appeared, in some degree, a moment of leis- ure, he Avould move to go into a committee of the Avhole upon the subject, conformably to the order of the 8th of last month.\" This proposition Avas met by a motion from Mr. Fisher Ames, of Massachusetts, to rescind the vote of the 8th of June, and to refer the business to a select committee. This motion gave rise to speeches professing not to be opposed to the consideration of amendments at a proper time and under proper circumstances, but showing a decided distrust of and distaste for the Avhole proceeding. The motion prevailed by a vote of 34 to 15, and a select committee was appointed, of which Mr. Vining, an opponent, was made chairman. The report of this committee contained substantially the amendments proposed by Mr. Madison, Avith some alterations and additions. These, after revision by the House, Avere finally passed by a vote of tAvo thirds in both Houses, submitted to the States and ratified by"], [217, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 195 them, as they now appear as the first ten of the twelve amendments that have been made to the Federal Constitu tion since its first adoption. Some of Mr. Madison's colleagues occasionally expressed a desire for the success of his propositions, and similar avowals were sometimes made by two or three members from other States ; but of substantial, persevering, and effective assistance, he may, with truth, be said to have had none, and two thirds of the House Avere at heart de cidedly opposed to the amendments that Avere made. With all his talents, industry, and perseverance, Mr. Madison Avould not have been able to carry them if his exertions hail not been secondetl by an influence still more efficacious. The legislature of Virginia alluded to the defects of the Constitution as \" involving all the great and inalienable rights of freemen,\" declared that its objections Avere not founded on speculative theory, but deduced from principles which had been established by the melancholy examples of other nations in different ages, and said, \" they will never be remoA-ed until the cause shall cease to exist.\" It an nounced the \"cause of amendment as a common cause,\" and its trust that commendable zeal would be shown by others also for obtaining those \" provisions Avhich experi ence had taught them were necessary to secure from dan ger the inalienable rights of human nature.\" It expressed its impatience of delay and its doubt as to the disposition of Congress ; complained of the slowness of its forms, but congratulated itself on the possession of another remedy, which it Avas determined to pursue, under the Constitution itself \u2014 that of a convention of the States. The New York application, signed, as Speaker, by John Lansing, Jr., Avho had left the Federal Convention in con sequence of his dissatisfaction with its proceedings and never returned to it, though not going as much into details,"], [218, "196 POLITICAL PARTIES employed language equally bold and uncompromising in demanding from Congress another convention, which might propose such amendments \"as it might find best calculated to promote our common interests, and secure to ourselves and our latest posterity the great and inalienable rights of mankind.\" This memorial asserted not only that the New York Convention had ratified \" in the fullest confidence of obtaining a revision of the Constitution by a general con vention, as appeared on the face of its ratification,\" but that that body (of which Hamilton was a member) were unani mous in the opinion that such a revision Avas necessary to recommend that instrument to the approbation and support of a numerous body of its constituents. These documents, and especially that of Virginia, pointed very emphatically to the source of that discontent with the Constitution which so extensively prevailed in the old Anti-Federal ranks. Even they felt that the Constitu tion Avas much better than they had expected, and the most considerate among them, those Avho were most capable of suspending their suspicions as to the designs of their oppo nents long enough to give the instrument a dispassionate con sideration, Avere soon satisfied \u2014 and Samuel Adams, who stood at the head of the Anti-Federal party, admitted \u2014 that its general structure Avas free from any insuperable ob jection. The life-tenure given to the Federal Judges was, as it indeed might Avell be, regarded as inconsistent Avith republican principles ; but it was to be remembered that those officers were expected to be, as they ought always to be, non-combatants in partisan politics by reason of their appointment to act as arbiters of the fates and fortunes of their countrymen. Upon the great point to Avhich the attention of such men was first directed, that of the ability of the State governments to maintain their soA-ereignty and independence under the new system, there was no real"], [219, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 197 ground for apprehension. But the Constitution was prin cipally confined to what Avere more strictly public concerns, the powers and duties of the Federal and State Govern ments in regard to National and State affairs, with only a slight sprinkling of provisions looking particularly to the protection of the citizen against the exercise of arbitrary power ; and it Avas accompanied by no Bill of Rights, such as those to Avhich the people had been accustomed in re spect to their State governments. In the latter cases they might more readily have been reconciled to the absence of such provisions, as those governments were carried on under their immediate observation, and they formed a part of them in much larger portions than they could expect to do of. the Federal Government. The latter they Avere too much in the habit of regarding, at that early period, as a foreign government only remotely responsible to them. We have already spoken of the settled character of their distrust of power for which there Avas only a remote, if any, responsibility, and of their having been trained bv ex perience to expect only abuses from the exercise of such authority, whether in State or Church, \u2014 an experience em bracing the sorrowful and well-remembered accounts of outrage and persecution against their ancestors, and the cruel oppression of the then existing generation bv the distant government of the mother country. We have seen how great had been their aversion and that of their ancestors to the establishment of a general government, and with what difficulties their consent to the call of the then recent Convention had been obtained, and Avhat care had been taken to restrict its power. It Avas not therefore surprising that a large majority of them should have man ifested such intense dissatisfaction when a Constitution was presented for their approval containing so few, so very feAV safeguards for the protection of \" the great and iualien-"], [220, "198 POLITICAL PARTIES able rights of freemen,\" as Virginia described them \u2014 of the \"great and inalienable rights of mankind,\" as the New York Legislature styled them \u2014 points to which the masses, especially of the Anti-Federalists, Avere so keenly alive. These considerations and circumstances produced a sud den and extensive spirit of discontent which, as those States avowed, never would be appeased until its causes were re moved, and Avith Avhich Mr. Madison was well satisfied the new Government would not be able to contend un less some mode AA'as devised to appease it. Although never a member of it, he had, in his long and persevering efforts to obtain the Constitution, \"tasted the quality,\" so to speak, of the old Anti-Federal party, and under stood the stuff' of which it was composed. He knew very Avell that the call of Virginia upon her co-States to make the demand for amendments \" a common cause \" would not be brutum fulmen, but that the agitation for a new convention in such hands, and commenced under such favorable circumstances, with so many materials of discon tent already made to their hands, Avould not cease until its object Avas gained, and Avhat Avould follow no man could tell. He Avas not so much of a Bourbon as Hamilton ; he had not pursued his thorny path through those trying scenes Avithout learning something of the character and temper of the people, or Avithout having his mind disabused of much that it had once entertained. No man in the country was more opposed to the call of a new convention, or more unwilling to make any amendments that would materially impair the original structure of the Constitu tion. The former he omitted to avow out of respect to the declared wishes of his State, but the latter he repeatedly announced because it was only in harmony Avith his past course. But he knew that matters could not remain as"], [221, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 199 they stood, and he thought a series of amendments could be made, some of which he deemed highly proper and all expedient, through which a large portion of the Anti- Federalists might be conciliated Avithout prejudice to the system which had been adopted. This course, to be useful, must, he Avas satisfied, be pursued at the very commence ment of the new government. He devoted himself, body and mind, to that object, and Ave have seen some of the difficulties with Avhich he had to contend. Although Ham ilton was not personally in Congress, he was Avell repre sented, and Madison found there, besides, many other Bour bons, in the sense in Avhich I use that term. He prepared a plan according to the views I have described ; and few exhibitions of that kind can have been more interesting than to see him stand between the Federal majority in the House and the few old Anti-Federalists Avho were there, and avail himself of the votes of each in turn to defeat the obnoxious efforts of the other ; first to arrest by Federal aid every attempt on the part of the few Anti- Federalists to mar his project by seeking amendments Avhich he was not himself prepared to adopt, and then to frustrate by Anti-Federal votes the efforts of a ma jority of the Federalists (though less than a majority of the House) to defeat his entire scheme. That the oidy alternative AA'as between a new conven tion and the adoption of amendments substantially like his, Avas the great fact Avhich he labored to impress upon the minds of the Federal members. He introduced it in his public speeches with never-failing delicacy, but with suffi cient clearness to be understood, and doubtless enforced it at private interviews as far as it was his habit to do such things. That important truth Avas the fulcrum on which he rested his lever, and he engineered his plan through the House and afterwards, as chairman of the Committee of"], [222, "200 POLITICAL PARTIES Conference, through both Houses (the majorities in each alike unfriendly to it) with triumphant and under the cir cumstances most extraordinary success. The dread of another Federal Convention has never failed, when the circumstances were sufficient to justify apprehension of its call, to deter the Federalists from the adoption of projects obnoxious to the democratic spirit of the country, however anxiously desired by themselves. Pendino- the election of President in the House, between Jefferson and Burr, the Republicans replied to the threat of putting the Government in the hands of an officer by act of Congress, by an open, united, and firm declaration that the day such au act passed, the Middle States Avould arm, and that they Avould \" call a convention to reorganize and amend the Constitution;\" upon the effect of which Mr. Jefferson remarks, \" the very word convention gives them the horrors, as, in the present democratical spirit of America, they fear they should lose some of the favorite morsels of the Constitution.\" Mr. Madison's ten amendments consisted of provisions in favor of the free exercise of religion, of speech, and of the press ; of assembling peaceably to petition the Gov ernment for a redress of grievances ; of the right to keep and bear arms ; against quartering soldiers in any house without the consent of the owner, except under certain qualifications ; against unreasonable searches and general warrants ; against being held to answer for crimes unless on presentment by a grand jury, with certain exceptions ; against being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense ; against being compelled to be a witness against one's self, or being deprived of life, liberty, or property Avithout due process of law; against taking private property for public use Avithout just compensation ; in favor of a trial by an impartial jury of the district in certain cases at common"], [223, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 201 law and in all criminal prosecutions, of the party charged being informed of the nature of the accusation, of bein\u00b0 confronted Avith the witnesses against him, of having com pulsory process for obtaining Avitnesses and the assistance of counsel in his defense ; against excessive bail, excessive fines or cruel punishments ; against the enumeration of certain rights being construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people ; and, finally, that powers not dele gated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohib ited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respect ively or to the people. These provisions embraced the points upon which the public mind was most susceptible, and upon which the old Anti-Federal party in particular had been, with obvious reason, most excited. That Mr. Madison's success in this great measure saved the Constitution from the ordeal of another Federal Con vention is a conclusion as certain as any that rests upon a contingency Avhich has not actually occurred, and that it converted the residue of the Anti-Federal party which had not supported the Constitution, Avhose members, as well as their political predecessors in every stage of our history, constituted a majority of the people, from opponents of that instrument into its warmest friends, and that they and their successors have from that time to the present period, either as Republicans or Democrats, occupied the position of its bond fide defenders in the sense in which it AA'as de signed to be understood by those Avho constructed and by those Avho ratified it, against every attempt to undermine or subvert it, are undeniable facts. It was by adding this great service to those he had rendered in obtaining the Convention, and in framing the Constitution in that body, that he deservedly Avon the noble title of \" Father of the Constitution.\" He Avas neither as"], [224, "202 POLITICAL PARTIES great a man nor as thorough a Republican, certainly not as thorough a Democrat, as Mr. Jefferson ; he had less genius than Hamilton ; yet it is doing him no more than justice to say that, as a civilian, he succeeded in making himself more practically useful to his country than any other man she has produced. No one Avould have been more ready than Mr. Jefferson to award to Mr. Madison this high distinction. He either told me at Mon ticello, or I heard it from him at second-hand, (I am un certain which Avas the case,) that whilst he was in France, some one whom he named asked him to say whom he thought the greatest man in America, and that he replied, if the gentleman would ask him to name the greatest man in the world he would comply with the request, which ad dition being made, he answered \" James Madison ! \" This brings us to the consideration of the contrast be tween the conduct of Hamilton and Madison in respect to their treatment of a Constitution which they had both taken such unwearied pains to bring into existence. The course they respectively pursued upon the subjects of finance and revenue, and the measures they respectively preferred, without regard to questions of constitutional power, only indicated differences of opinion upon sub jects in which such differences are apt to arise, aud did not necessarily inA'olve the political integrity of either. But we have now arrived at a point of departure in the relative course of these great men involving graver con siderations, and to which it is to be regretted that the last reservation cannot be truly applied. There was no war rant in the Constitution for the establishment of a national bank, or for the assumption of the State debts, or for the unlimited claim of power by the Federal Government over the collection and disbursement of national revenue, and for its patronage of by far the largest proportion of the"], [225, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 203 pursuits and interests of the country, all of Avhich Avere effected by Hamilton or recommended in his Report on Manufactures, and he understood perfectly Avell that the Constitution conferred no such powers Avhen he advocated successfully the first tAvo of those measures, and asserted the power and recommended its exercise in respect to the latter. It is not agreeable to be obliged to assume that a gentle man of General Hamilton's elevated character in private life, upon whose integrity and fidelity in his personal deal ings and in the discharge of every private trust that was reposed in him no shadow rested, who Avas indifferent to the accumulation of wealth, Avho as a public man was so free from intrigues for personal advancement, and whose thoughts and acts in that character Avere so constantly directed to great questions and great interests, could yet prove faithless to one of the most sacred public trusts that can be placed in man \u2014 the execution of the funda mental law of the land. If Hamilton had been asked, as a private man, whether he believed it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution to confer upon Congress the power to establish a national bank, and Avhether he be lieved that the people when they ratified it supposed that it contained such a power, he Avould, if he answered at all, have answered \"No ! \" He Avas incapable of willful decep tion on the subjact. This discrepancy between his conduct as a statesman in the management of public affairs and his integrity and truthfulness in private life Avas the result of a vicious opinion as to the obligations of a public man, and in no degree attributable to any inferior sense of personal honor, nor was it ever otherwise regarded. His position upon this point is understood to have been founded on the following opinions : That the people as a body Avere not capable of managing their public affairs"], [226, "204 POLITICAL PARTIES Avith safety to their happiness and Avelfare ; that it Avas, therefore, a proper exercise of power to give the manage ment of them into the hands of those Avho Avere capable, and to place the latter in positions, as far as practicable under the circumstances, beyond popular control ; that it Avas the sacred duty of those who were so intrusted to ex ercise their power truly and sincerely for the best interests of those for whom they acted ; that if those interests could be Avell administered without transcending the power with which the public functionary was invested, or Avithout the practice of deception or corruption, such Avould be the pref erable anil proper course ; but if violations of the popular will, deception, or corruptions \u2014 not those of the grosser kind, like direct bribery, but such as belonged to the class he spoke of to Mr. Adams as constituting the life-giving principle of the English system \u2014 were necessary, in the best judgment of men in power, to the security or ad vancement of the public Avelfare, the employment of such means Avas justifiable. Without stopping to cite authorities, I assume \u2014 on the strength of the opinion of the age in Avhich he lived, of his Avritings, of his declarations, which were, beyond almost all other public men, Avithout resen'e, and of his acts \u2014 that such were his A'ieAvs, and content myself Avith the declaration that the existence of such views is the best, if not the only, excuse that can be made for his official course. At the close of the Convention, and just before signing the Constitution, he declared that the latter might serve as a temporary bond of union, but could neA'er suffice to se cure good government. After he had succeeded iu his first two interpolations, he spoke exultingly of the success of the Constitution, and hopefully of the future ; this Avas because he kneAv that he had prospered in his attempt to"], [227, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 205 give it a construction not dreamed of at the former period by himself, or others to his knowledge; and his hopes of the future Avere founded on his success also in his plan set forth in his Report on Manufactures, widening very greatly the breach he had already effected in the Constitu tion. In February, 1802, after his latitudinarian scheme had been arrested and was in danger of being permanently overthrown, he described the Constitution to Gouverneur Morris as a \" frail and Avorthless fabric,\" the \" fate \" of which he had \"anticipated from the very beginning.\" He never reproached his friends with an unwillingness to go as far as the Constitution would justify, but always attrib uted their failure to defects in the system, thus admitting that the measures in which he exulted and from which he hoped so much, had been established by him, not under, but outside of that instrument. The first marked effect of Hamilton's determination to pursue the course I have described Avas a separation be tAveen him and his most efficient coadjutor upon many points during the government of the Confederation, and the next was the formation of the old Republican party. The motives for the separation between those distinguished associates have been made the subject, as might have been expected, of various and extensive comment. So far as I know, Hamilton never spoke of Madison, after their sep aration, in any other terms than those which Avere consist ent AA'ith the knoAvledge he possessed of the purity and integrity of his character. Few men had such perfect control over their feelings as Mr. Madison, and few ex ercised more reserve in speaking of the motives of his political opponents. It has been rare indeed that he has ventured to touch upon them even Avhen necessary to his vindication from aspersions upon his own character, a truth obvious to any one familiar with his life and writings. I"], [228, "206 POLITICAL PARTIES however accidentally came into the possession of informa tion upon this precise question of very great interest, which Avill be found in the letter below from Nicholas P. Trist, Esq. In the course of a conversation between Mr. Trist, myself, and other gentlemen, at Philadelphia, last spring,1 upon the subject of which they had only a general bearing, the former alluded to the circumstances here given in detail, and subsequently, at my request, reduced them to the shape in which they now appear. Mr. Trist was a much esteemed and highly trusted friend of Mr. Jefferson, and married his favorite grand daughter, a lady of superior intelligence, with whom I Avas Avell acquainted. He was also for many years a neighbor and confidential friend of Mr. Madison, toward the decline of the life of the latter. My knowledge of him has been derived from long and familiar intercourse Avith him as a confidential clerk in my department Avhilst I was Secretary of State, as consul of the United States at Havana, and as private secretary of President Jackson, and I do not hesitate to say that I never kneAv a more upright man. No one who has had opportunities to become well ac quainted with his character, however politically or person ally prepossessed in regard to him in other respects, will, I am very sure, fail to admit his perfect truthfulness, and the authenticity of any relation he might make upon the strength of his own knowledge. FROM MR. TRIST. Philadelphia, May 31, 1857. My dear Sir, \u2014 My promise, hoAvever tardily per formed, has never been forgotten ; and uoav, complying with your request preferred at the time and since renewed, I give you in writing the statement made by me a month 1 In the spring of 1857. [\"Eds."], [229, "207 IN THE UNITED STATES. or tAvo ago in conversation at Mr. Gilpin's ; which state ment you Avill recollect was casually elicited, as the proper commentary upon the charge mentioned by one of the com pany as being brought against Mr. Jefferson \u2014 the charge, namely, that he had \" stolen Mr. Madison from the Fed eralists.\" This notion, by the way, involves an utterly erroneous conception of the relation which existed between the minds and characters of the two men. But I must here confine myself to doing Avhat you asked of me. During the latter years of Mr. Madison's life, (the ex act date is recorded in a memorandum not now at hand,) the following incident occurred. My intimate friend Mr. Davis, LaAv Professor in the University of Virginia, mentioned to me, as a thing which he thought Mr. Madison ought to be apprised of, that in a forthcoming Life of Colonel Hamilton, by one of his sons, the authenticity of his (Mr. M.'s) report of Colonel H.'s speech in the Federal Convention Avas to be denied ; and furthermore he Avas to be represented as having \"aban doned \" Colonel Hamilton. This Davis had learnt from Professor George Tucker, of the same University, then recently returned from a trip to the North. Of course, on my first visit to Mr. Matlison, which oc curred soon after, I told him of what Davis had said. The effect upon his countenance was an expression of painful surprise, succeeded by a very remarkable look his face assumed sometimes, and which Avas deeply impressive from its concentration and solemnity. A silence of some moments Avas broken by his saying, in a tone corresponding to that look, \"Sorry to hear it.\" Then a pause, followed by these words, \"I abandoned Colonel Hamilton, \u2014 or Colonel Hamilton abandoned me, \u2014 in a Avord, Ave parted, \u2014 upon its plainly becoming his purpose and endeavor to adminisTRATiOis (administer) the government into a thing"], [230, "208 POLITICAL PARTIES totally different from that which he and I both kneAv per fectly well had been understood and intended by the Con vention which framed it, and by the people in adopting it.\" Upon the two Avords which I have underscored, espe cially the second, and most especially its last tAA'O syllables, a marked emphasis Avas laid. The latter (the Avord ad ministration used as a verb) is the only instance of neolo gism I ever observed in Mr. Madison. Its effectiveness Avas most striking; it hit the nail plumb on the head, and drove it home at one blow. -The Avhole history of that business, the entire truth of the matter, was compressed into that one word. As uttered by him there Avas a pause at \"aclminis\" \u2014 aud then came out \"tration.\" It was fol lowed by the word \" administer,\" thrown in parenthetically, and in an under-tone ; as much as to say, \" I have been coining a word here, which, as you are aware, is not my habit ; but just as I Avas about to say administer the gov ernment, I felt that this term is too general, too common place, too tame to convey the idea present to my mind ; anil this modification of it presented itself as exactly suited to the case.\" As regards the speech, Mr. M. seemed painfully troubled at the thought of the fidelity of his report of it being dis puted, and at a loss to realize the possibility of such a thing. \" Why, as I once related to you, that speech was placed by me in Colonel Hamilton's own hand ; and Avas, after deliberate perusal, returned by him Avith an explicit recognition of its correctness \u2014 all to a very few verbal alterations, which Avere made ; on which occasion he placed in my hands, as the proper accompaniment of his speech in my record, and as presenting in a precise and exact shape his views as to the government Avhich it Avas desira ble to establish, the draft of a Constitution Avhich he had prepared before coming to the Convention.\""], [231, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 209 This substantially, if not exactly, is Avhat Mr. M. said upon that point. He then went on to conjecture in what way Colonel H.'s biographer might have been misled into this error ; not a doubt being intimated or evinced by him as to its being honestly an error. Colonel H. spoke sev eral times in the Convention \u2014 at greater or less length, as would be seen Avhen his (Mr. M.'s) notes were given to the world. Perhaps, among his papers notes had been found, which, in the absence of means of discriminating betAveen remarks made on different occasions, and between notes for an intended speech and that which the speaker had actually said, might have given rise to the misconcep tion. To the foregoing incident you wished me to add what I was led to say, in the course of the same conversation, regarding Mr. Jefferson's habitual tone in speaking of Colonel Hamilton. This was always the very reverse of that in which he spoke of those whose characters, personal or political, Avere objects of his disesteem. It was inva riably such as to indicate, and to infuse (certainly this effect Avas produced upon my mind) a high estimate of Colonel Hamilton as a man, Avhether considered with ref erence to personal matters or to political matters. He was never spoken of otherwise than as being a gentleman \u2014 a lofty-minded, high-toned man. As regards politics, their convictions, their creeds, Avere diametrically opposite. Colonel H. had no faith in republican government. In his eyes the British Government was the perfection of human government, the model of all that was practically attain able in politics. His doctrine, openly avowed, was that there are but tAvo ways of governing men, but tAvo Avays in which the business of government can be conducted : the one is through fear, the other through self-interest \u2014 that is, influencing the conduct of those upon whom the 14"], [232, "210 POLITICAL PARTIES course of political affairs depends, through their desire for personal advantages, for position, for wealth, and so forth. In this country, to operate upon men through their fears was out of the question ; and consequently the latter con stituted the only practicable means. These political convic tions on the part of Colonel H., united as they Avere Avith his splendid abilities and his lofty character as a man, both public and private, were regarded by Mr. Jefferson as having constituted the great peril to Avhich republicanism had been exposed in our country. But for the character of Colonel H., for the man, for his honesty and sincerity and single-mindedness, \u2014 I mean considered Avith refer ence to politics, \u2014 there was never the least indication of depreciation or disrespect on the part of Mr. Jefferson ; always the direct reverse. Never, in a single instance, when Colonel H. was the subject of conversation with me, or in my presence, was it otherwise than perfectly manifest that, in Mr. J.'s habitual feeling toward him, the broadest possible line of demar cation existed betAveen the man, the character, (the public character, I repeat, no less than the private,) and the creed by which the action and course of that character were de termined ; and that whilst the latter was abhorrent to his OAvn cherished faith, and had been for him the cause of the intensest anxiety and gloomiest forebodings ever suffered by him, the former was nevertheless no less truly an object of sincere respect. Having thus, my dear sir, at length fulfilled my prom ise, \u2014 though not within the limited space (far from it) which you intimated, \u2014 I tender the assurance of my respectful regard and friendly remembrance.

S."], [233, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 211 Hamilton took the position of Avhich the virtuous Madison, whilst standing at the brink of his grave, left behind him a description so graphic, promptly and, as was his habit, immovably. The crisis met him in his last intrenchment. He believed honestly, sincerely, and Avithout any designs other than such as related to the public welfare, that noth ing short of monarchical institutions would prove adequate to the Avants of the country, but these he Avas well satisfied could not be obtained then, and possibly not for a long period. He had approached them in the Convention as nearly, in respect to the point of efficiency, as would afford the slightest chance of success for his plan, and he had been left Avithout a single open supporter in that body. Regarding the Constitution, as framed by the Convention, as the only avenue to escape from anarchy, he finally pro moted its passage there and its ratification by the States and people, avowedly as a temporary bond of union. Ap pointed to assist in carrying it into effect, and sincerely be lieving that, with no other powers than those only Avhich he and Madison so AA'ell knew it Avas intended to authorize, it must prove a failure and the government established under it must go to pieces, he decided, unhesitatingly and absolutely, to do under it Avhatever he in good faith might think Avould promote the general Avelfare, Avithout reference to the intentions of its authors. He Avas a man of too much good sense to do unnecessary violence to public feel ing, \u2014 as he said to Jefferson \" to publish it in Dan or Beersheba,\" \u2014 but such was his unchangeable design. On the contrary, he entered into labored and able discussions to shoAV that his principal measures Avere authorized by the Constitution, but these were in deference to the prejudices and ideas of the people, nothing more. There is nothing in the writings, speeches, or declara tions of General Hamilton inconsistent with the truth of"], [234, "212 POLITICAL PARTIES this statement. In papers which have been referred to, and others, he submitted ingenious arguments to show that the Convention might have so intended, and that Congress had a right to hold from the words employed that it did so intend, but he was too circumspect to insist that the inten tion of the Convention ought not to prevail when it could be ascertained, or to make the actual intention, as a mat ter of fact, a point in the argument. Giving due weight to the intention of the body when that was ascertained, he adopted a course of reasoning which every body under stood Avent to defeat it, desiring no other efficacy for the opinion he labored to establish than the vote of the ma jority. The better knowledge of the country overthrew his specious deductions in a short time, and its traditions will, it is to be hoped, render them forever harmless. The principle of construction contended for by Hamil ton, and for a season to some extent made successful, was not designed for the promotion of a particular measure, for which the poAvers of Congress under the Constitution were to be unduly extended, on account of its assumed in dispensable importance to the public safety, but intended as a SAveeping rule by which those poAvers, instead of being confined to the constitutional enumeration, A\\'ere to author ize the passage of all laws which Congress might deem conducive to the general Avelfare and Avhich were not ex pressly prohibited ; a power similar to that contained in the plan he proposed in the Convention. He desired, in short, to make the Constitution a tablet of wax upon which each successive administration Avould be at liberty to impress its rescripts, to be promulgated as constitutional edicts. Hamilton never well understood the distinctive charac ter of our people, but he understood human nature too well to believe that any people could long respect or desire"], [235, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 213 to uphold a Constitution the most stringent provisions of Avhich Avere thus regarded or treated. Its inevitable fate is illustrated in the experience of France, after one of her unscrupulous wits had aided in consigning to general derision that litter of Constitutions which had rapidly fol loAved one after the other, by accompanying his oath with a grimace and a jest upon the number which he had suc cessively and Avith equal solemnity sworn to support. The example of France was not lost upon a mind so watchful as Hamilton's, and he did not doubt that our Constitution would be overthrown with the same certainty, if not with equal facility, after it had been long enough treated with similar disrespect, and that the door would be thus opened for the ultimate introduction, under the influence of the money power, of the only political institutions in which he placed absolute confidence. He declared it to be his opin ion, in the Convention, that he regarded ours as the last chance for a republican government, and assigned that opinion as a reason for his attempt to infuse into the neAv system qualities as stringent as those he proposed and which he kneAv very Avell were not generally regarded as belonging to a republican system. No man better under stood than he that the inviolate sanctity of a written Con stitution was the life of a republican government, and that its days Avere numbered from the moment its people and rulers ceased thus to preserve, protect, and defend it. Mr. Jefferson spoke, in his letter, of Hamilton as \"professing \" that it was \"the duty of its administrators to conduct the Government on the principles their constituents had elected.\" I did not at first, and for a long time afterwards, attach as much significance to the word I have here ital icized, as I do noAV, Avhen I have studied Hamilton's course more carefully. I knew the letter was written in a liberal spirit tOAvard his memory.

Mr. Jef ferson was evidently disposed to confirm the favorable im pressions I had imbibed of the personal side of Hamilton's character, and the Avords quoted above from his letter Avere designed to qualify his imputation of monarchical princi ples to the latter, and I can hoav appreciate the motive for the expression used, Avhich did not commit him to a con cession that the opinion of Hamilton in regard to the duty of administration was that upon Avhich he acted. With all these considerations before him, Hamilton did more than any, and I had almost said than all, his contem poraries together, to counteract the will of the people and to subvert by undermining the Constitution of their choice. If his sapping and mining policy had been finally success ful, if the Republican party, mostly composed of old Anti- Federalists, led by so bold a spirit and such a root-and branch Republican as Mr. Jefferson, had not arrested the farther progress of his principles and demolished his scheme, this glorious old Constitution of ours, of Avhich we all seem so proud, of which it is so great an honor to have been and of which so many have been ambitious to be, regarded as the faithful expounder, under the Avings of which we have risen from small beginnings to be a puis sant nation, \u2014 attracting the admiration and able to com mand the respect of the civilized world, \u2014 Avould long since have sunk beneath the waters of time, an object of neglect and scorn.

In this aspect, notwithstanding his great and good qualities, \u2014 and he had many, \u2014 Hamilton's course A\\-as an outrage upon liberty and a crime against free government. How happy Avould it have been for himself and for every interest if he had not parted from his friend and faithful fello\\A'-laborer through so many and such trving scenes, \u2014 if, like Madison, not entirely satisfied Avith the Constitution, but knowing that many others were in the same predicament, he had applied his great talents to the business of making it as generally acceptable as possible, and in giving to the masses an administration of the Gov ernment according not only to the form but to the spirit al>o in \\A'hich it had been framed. The country AA-ould then at length have rested after so many storms, and his great and good friend Washington, instead of being steeped to the lips in partisan anxieties, (as his nephew, Judge Bushrod Washington, described him to me to haA'e been within the year of his death.)

The most prominent of his measures have been, as already said, discarded, and those Avho constituted the party in whose name they were first introduced have so far yielded to the current of public opinion as to abandon them forever. I have also before alluded to the gratifying circumstance that the odium attached to those measures never in any degree affected the confidence of the people in the patriotism of Washington or in his fidelity to repub lican institutions, or weakened their affection for him while he lived, or their respect for his memory when he was no more. These were not the results of mere personal devo tion, but of an intelligent and just discrimination on the part of the people. Hamilton designed to effect a civil revolution by changing the powers of Congress from the restricted character given to them in obedience to the wishes of the people to one in effect unlimited. Washing ton entertained no such views. His constructions of the Constitution were designed for the cases that called them forth, and had no ulterior views. The subject of the bank presented the principal and almost the only question upon which President Washing ton gave a construction to that instrument which met the disapprobation and excited the apprehensions of the old Republicans.

The public were therefore left to draw their own inferences in regard to their character. Diverse opinions upon the point of course arose, and there is much reason to believe (and that belief is strengthened by his subsequent course in re spect to another important matter) that he Avas induced to regard a bank as indispensable, in the then condition of the country, to the success of the new Government \u2014 an exi gency in public affairs of that peculiar sort which men in power assume to deal Avith under the sanction of the great principle, Salus popali suprema lex.

Whilst reviewing the 44 era of good-feeling,\" as it was called, during the adminis tration of Mr. Monroe, I conceived the idea of adding some account of the rise and progress of our political parties, and entered upon the task immediately, designing it to stand as an episode in my Memoirs. The subject grew upon my hands to such an extent that for the last two years it has, in necessary reading and ex aminations into facts, &c, occupied most of the time that could be de voted to the general object. The idea of limiting this portion to a mere digression was therefore sub stantially laid aside, and the dignity of a separate and distinct considera tion, to which its dimensions, if noth ing else, entitled it, was assigned to it. Accordingly I continued my ex amination of the course of parties in the United States down to the present time, including the first months of President Buchanan's administration. Whilst engaged in correcting the manuscript and arranging it to be copied, and after I had, by many pages, passed the place in the text to which this note is appended, the first volume of Mr. Randall's Life of Jefferson, recently published, came to my hands, and on reading its last two chapters first, because they have a more immediate bearing on my subject, I find the following very striking confirmation of the correct ness of my inference as to the state of General Washington's mind, on the occasion spoken of: \u2014 from Randall's \" life of Jeffer- SON,\" VOL.

He also signed the Bank. But he was 'very near not doing so ; and if he had refused, it would, in my opinion, have produced a crisis. I will mention to you a cir cumstance which I have never im parted, except in strict confidence. You know, by the Constitution, ten davs are allowed for the President's veto to come in. If it does not ap pear within that time, the bill be comes a law.

Afterwards General Washington placed in his hands the papers from which to write his Fare well Address. But it was a rule of Mr. Madison's life, as I have noticed before, never to injure the feelings of any man as long as it could possibly be avoided, and he suffered long and much to avoid it. His papers will be examined in vain for imputations of faults to his contemporaries. They are even omitted in cases where they would have been the readiest and ap parently the indispensable means of repelling unjust imputations upon himself. He carried this self-denial farther than any other public man. The pain and regret that he exhibited in his conversation with Mr. Trist, in respect to the parting between Ham ilton and himself, were obviously gen uine, but the necessity was absolute, and the danger that justice might not otherwise be done to his character imminent. He was on the eve of his departure for another world, \u2014 his well earned and well established repu tation was about to lose his own per sonal guardianship, \u2014 and the subject was brought before him in such a way that he must either confess the forthcoming impeachments by his silence, or repel them by declaring the truth. \" ' The foregoing is written imme diately after the conversation, which has not lasted half an hour, \u2014 Mr. Madison having stepped out, and I taking advantage of this interruption to retire to my room and commit the substance to paper. The very words I have retained, as near as I could. In many instances (where I have run a line over the words2) I have done this exactly.' \" This statement by Mr. Madison substantially sustains the view I have taken of General Washington's posi tion at that period. The letters of all the leading Federalists of that day, and those that followed it for some years, show that they looked with great unanimity to Hamilton rather than to Washington for the tone and direction that was to be given to the movements of the Federal party, and leave scarcely a doubt that they would have sided with Hamilton if a differ ence had arisen between the two, as is here intimated by Mr. Madison. How much is it to be regretted that the latter did not leave behind him a history of the events of his life and an account of what he knew of the views of others.

He did not fail to see that to act again, and under existing circumstances, upon the principle to which he had given his sanction in the case of the bank, would be to commit himself to Hamilton's latitudinarian doctrines in respect to the construction of the Constitution, and he vetoed the bill.1 1 Jefferson's Correspondence, Vol. IV. p. 466."], [243, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 221 It would have been well for the country if the injurious effects of Hamilton's policy and principles had been con fined to his own times, but men of such rare genius, dis tinguished by the same eagerness, industry, and energy in pursuit of their objects, seldom fail to leave a durable mark upon the Avorld in which they have bustled, especially when their day is contemporaneous with the commencement of a new government, and when they are intrusted with great power, as Avas emphatically the case with Hamilton. He and Jefferson, both answering to this description, have always been regarded by me as the bane and antidote of our political system. Every speech and every writing of Hamilton exhibited proof of deep research and laborious study. Men, governments, and political measures, Avere his favorite subjects of reflection and discussion. Of the former, more particularly of the mass, he had (as I have elsewhere said) formed unfavorable opinions; not that he Avas less desirous than others for their welfare \u2014 for few men were more philanthropic in disposition \u2014 but because of the early and ineffaceable impression upon his mind that the majority of men, in their collective capacity, Avere radi cally deficient in respect for order and for the rights of persons and of property.

In the performance of such duties they very naturally conclude that government should look to the more intelligent and better informed classes for sup port, and as naturally that to enable them to render such support they should receive partial favors and extraordi nary advantages from its administration. Men of this class, their associates and dependents, as AA'as foreseen, embraced Avith alacrity and supported with the energy inspired by self-interest the principle of political reciprocity between gOA-ernment and its supporters inaugurated in England at the Revolution of 1688, and ingrafted upon our system by Hamilton in 1790.

There are always men connected with these associations Avhose democratic principles are so deeply implanted in their very natures as to place them above the influence of circum stances ; but they are few and far between. These changes are not the fruit of infirm purposes or characters, but are produced by influences which seem no farther traceable than is here imperfectly done, and are yet sufficiently effec tive to convert to Hamiltonian principles more than three fourths of the Democrats who become members of the associations of Avhich I have spoken. Such aggregations of wealth and influence, connected as they usually are or soon become with social distinctions, naturally come to be regarded as the fountains of patron age by those who are in search of it. The press, men of letters, artists, and professional men of every denomina tion, and those engaged in subordinate pursuits who live upon the luxurious indulgences of the rich, are all brought within the scope of this influence. It is perhaps in this way only that we can account for the remarkable disparity in number between the newspapers and other periodi cals advocating Democratic principles and those which support the views of the money power and its adherents \u2014 a disparity the extraordinary extent of which will strike any one who visits a common reading-room, in which, amid the well-furnished shelves and full files of the publi cations of the latter class, it is rare that we find many of the former, often not more than a single newspaper, sometimes not one. Yet those which we do not find there represent the political principles of a large majority of the people. The same fact attracts the attention of the ob server in passing through countries abroad which are under monarchical institutions.

To return to the point from which I started in this long and doubtless prolix review \u2014 a political party founded on such principles and looking to such sources for its support does not often stand in need of caucuses and conventions to preserve harmony in its ranks. Constructed principally of a network of special interests, \u2014 almost all of them looking to Government for encouragement of some sort, \u2014 the feelings and opinions of its members spontaneously point in the same direction, and when those interests are thought in danger, or new inducements are held out for their advancement, notice of the apprehended assault or promised encouragement is circulated through their ranks with a facility always supplied by the sharpened Avit of cupidity. Their conflicts in council, Avhen such occur, are for the same reasons less likely to be obstinate and more easily reconciled. Sensible of these facts, the policy of their leaders has been from the beginning to discountenance and explode all usages or plans designed to secure party unity, so essential to their opponents and substantially unnecessary to themselves. Hamilton's system considered with reference to the effect it was calculated to exert upon most of the classes at Avhom it aimed, did great credit to his sagacity. The won der has always been that a party Avhich has had at its command so large a portion of the appliances generally"], [249, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 227 most effective in partisan warfare should meet Avith such infrequent success in the elections. Strangers who visit us are especially struck Avith this to them unaccountable circumstance, and superficial observers at home are often scarcely less impressed by it ; and yet the secret of its failure lies on the surface. Although Hamilton's policy was successful with many, it failed signally, as has been stated, with the most numerous and consequently the most powerful class of our citizens \u2014 those engaged in agricul ture ; a class Avith Avhich the intercourse of strangers is the most limited, and the strength of which, from the seclu sion and unobtrusiveness of its common life, is very apt to be underrated by other ranks even of our own* people. It not oidy failed to attract their sympathies in his favor, but excited their dissatisfaction by its extension of govern mental favors to others in which they could not participate consistently Avith their inherited and cherished principles, and which Avere not necessary to their pursuits ; thus in creasing that antagonism to some extent between those who live by the sAveat of their broAv and those Avho live by their wits. These adverse results of his policy con tinued after its execution devolved upon his disciples. Farmers and planters \u2014 the main-stay of the Democratic party \u2014 seldom allow themselves, as I have before said, to be drawn before Congress or into the audience chambers of Presidents and Cabinets, suppliants for special favors to the interest in which they are engaged. The indifference exhibited by the agriculturists of America, at the period of the Stamp Act, to the overflowing offers of bounties, is still shown by their uncorrupted successors. The promised aid to their business held out by Hamilton in his famous Re port on Manufactures, both direct and consequential, there fore excited no feeling in their breasts save strong sus picions of his motives."], [250, "228 POLITICAL PARTIES Our political history abounds Avith instances in Avhich similar attempts to obtain the support of the many by appeals to the self-interest of the Tcav have shared the same fate. They seldom fail to prove offensive to the taste and humiliating to the pride of our people. The wisest Avay to the confidence and support of the latter is to confine the action of the admininistration of the Federal Government to the duties specifically enjoined upon it by the Constitu tion, and to the able and honest discharge of them. States men Avho act upon this rule are much more likely to close their official careers with credit to themselves and advan tage to the country than by resort to experiments, hoAvever splendidvor plausible. Occasions may indeed be presented on which temporary derangements in the affairs of the State and of individuals are produced of sufficient magni tude to baffle all calculations and to disappoint the best intentions and the wisest measures, but these must of necessity be of rare occurrence. The administrations of Jefferson, Madison, and Jackson were thus conducted, and they had their reward. The success of Mr. Madison's Avas, it is true, greatly retarded by obstructions placed in its Avay by the money power, with a vieAv to drive him to a dishonorable peace by crippling his resources ; but he and his associates in the Government triumphed, notwithstanding, for that poAver had not then acquired the strength Avhich it subsequently attained, and the field for the display of that Avhich it possessed Avas not a safe one, Avhile the passions of the people were excited by a state of open Avar and were liable to be turned Avith augmented fury against such as virtually aided the public enemy. It was in its palmiest state in 1832, when it de manded a re-charter of the Bank of the United States, and Avhen, this being refused, it commenced the struggle for the expulsion of President Jackson from the chair of"], [251, "229 IN THE UNITED STATES.

Although it lacked time to mature its measures sufficiently for the accomplishment of that particular object, it continued its assaults upon the Executive, materially weakened its influence in the National Legislature, and after a ruthless war of eight years succeeded in overthroAv ing the administration of his successor and in obtaining possession of the Government. But the methods of the great men and successful Presi dents Avhom I have named Avere too simple, and the tenor of their way too noiseless and even for the adventurous genius of Hamilton's school. To devise elaborate schemes for the management of that branch of the Government intrusted to his control, and of such as fell within the scope of his influence, Avas more to his liking. The construction and execution of these made necessary the use of powers not granted by the Constitution, and led to a perversion of its provisions, of Avhich we have seen the consequences. John Quincy Adams was the first President, after the civil revolution of 1800, A\\ho entered upon the duties of his office with vieAVS of the Constitution as latitudinarian as Avere those of Hamilton, and the only one of that stamp avIio possessed sufficient force of character to make his will the rule of action for his cabinet, and Avho lived long enough to make it to some extent effectual. Although elected as a convert to the principles of the then Repub lican party, he Avas no sooner seated in the Presidential chair than he disavoAved those principles in their most im portant features \u2014 those of Constitutional construction \u2014 and marked out a course in that regard Avhich he intended to pursue. He thereby united that party against his re election to an extent sufficient to defeat it by an over whelming majority. Of the party Avhich thus a second time vindicated the Constitution, by far the most effective ingredient Avas the"], [252, "230 POLITICAL PARTIES landed interest. But though the most powerful, it AA'as yet far from being its only valuable element, for, to use Mr. Jefferson's Avords on the former occasion, there Avas besides \" a great mass of talent on the Republican side.\" If there be any Avhom experience has not yet satisfied of the power of the landed interest, and of its capacity to cope successfully with the money power of the country, enormous as has been the groAvth of the latter, let them consider the facts disclosed by the census. By that of 1850, our population, as affecting the point under consid eration, is shown to have consisted at that time of farmers, two millions three hundred and sixty thousand; of planters, twenty-seven thousand ; of laborers engaged in agricul ture, thirty-seven thousand ; of persons engaged in com merce, trade, manufactures, mechanic arts, and mining, one million six hundred thousand ; in laAv, medicine, and divinity, ninety-four thousand. Let them compare these Avith previous enumerations, and they will see Iioav invariable and large is the disproportion in numbers be tween the agricultural and other classes. That dispropor tion must of course have been greater during our colonial existence and at the Revolutionary period, when our com merce was trifling, and Ave AA'ere almost if not entirely des titute of manufactures. We are hence able to form an idea of the extent to Avhich the defense of the principles Avhich the colonists cherished, and for the maintenance of Avhich the Revolution was made, rested on the broad shoulders of the landed interest from the beginning' to the end of that great contest. Without the hearty and constant cooperation of that interest the impassable barrier that has been erected against the politically demoralizing and anti-republican tendency of the Hamiltonian policy could never have been main tained. I have alluded to the reasons for my belief that"], [253, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 231 it is placed by its position and by the laAv of its nature be yond the reach of that policy, and my firm conviction that it will secure to our people the blessings of republican government as long as it remains the predominant interest in the country. It can only be when the agriculturists abandon the implements and the field of their labor and become, Avith those who now assist them, shopkeepers, manufacturers, carriers, and traders, that the Republic will be brought in danger of the influences of the money power. But this can never happen. Every inclination of the landed interest, however slight, in that direction has been to it a prolific source of loss, regret, and repentance. Be tAveen 1835 and 184-0, Avhen the country was stimulated to madness by the Bank of the United States and its allies, the interests of agriculture were so much neglected as to lead to large importations of breadstuff's from Europe, whilst the land was covered with luxury, soon succeeded by bankruptcy and want. But the sober second-thought of the people, in a remarkably brief period, not only brought that great branch of the industry of the country back to the point from Avhich it had been seduced, but drove from power those avIio had risen to it upon the strength of a temporary popular delusion. If any doubt the existence and agency of a political in fluence such as I have described under the name of the money poAver, or think the description exaggerated, let me ask them to ponder upon its achievements in the country from Avhich it has been transplanted to our shores. It is but little more than a century and a half since it Avas first interpolated upon the English system, and Ave have seen the results it has in that period produced upon its rivals: every vestige of the feudal system that survived the Rev olution of 1688 extinguished ; the landed aristocracy, once lords paramount, depressed to an average power in the"], [254, "232 POLITICAL PARTIES State ; the Crown, still respected, and its possessor at this moment justly beloved by all, yet substantially reduced to a pageant, protected indeed by the prejudices of John Bull in favor of ancestral forms and state ceremonies, but of almost no account as an element of power when Aveighed against the well-ascertained opinion of the people of Eng land.

IT cannot have failed to strike the reader of these pages that a comparatively slight notice has been taken of that"], [256, "234 POLITICAL PARTIES party Avhich has for more than half a century, Avith rare and limited exceptions, administered the Government of our country. This is easily explained. During the first twelve years of the existence of this Government, the period during which the two great parties of the country received that \" form and pressure \" which they have never lost, the Federalists Avere in power, and of course principal actors in the management of public affairs. Expositions of their measures and of the circumstances under Avhich they Avere brought fonvard, and criticisms upon those measures, naturally acquire greater prominence in a review of the period than the less salient manifestations of the opposition permit. The resistance made by the latter to those measures involved a succession of sacrifices and ser vices Avhich it is now difficult to appreciate at their full value, but which, when correctly estimated, reflect the highest honor upon those engaged in it and deserve the fullest notice. The four great crises in our national affairs AA'ere, first, the Revolution ; second, the government of the Confeder ation between the recognition of our Independence and the adoption of the present Constitution ; third, the struggle for and the acquisition of that instrument ; and fourth, Hamilton's attempt to make of the Government which had been established under it a delusion, and the Constitution a sham, to pave the Avay for its overthroAV and for the final introduction of institutions more accordant Avith his opin ions ; \u2014 for, as I haA'e remarked, no intelligent man could have expected that the people of America Avould long en dure a Constitution subject to the treatment to Avhich he had exposed it, and to such as he had still in store for it. In the crisis of the Revolution, the conduct of all Avho subsequently composed the tAvo great parties in the country \u2014 save the Tories, Avho Avere soon absorbed by one of"], [257, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 235 them, \u2014 Avas equally meritorious. The difference between them in point of numbers was largely in favor of those who \\A-ere aftenvards called Anti-Federalists, and, still later, Republicans, and in point of talents and perhaps in social position on the side of the Federalists. The condition of the country, during the second impor tant juncture, may be not inaptly illustrated by the com mon figure of a strong man struggling in a morass. Nothing was stable, and nothing which promised substan tial relief seemed for a season practicable. Of the promi nent measures brought forward by both parties to extricate the country from its embarrassments, those proposed by the Federalists \\A'ere the wisest, and, as the result proved, well adapted to the exigences of the occasion. In the contest for the Constitution that party was also throughout more useful than its opponents. In this esti mate the course taken by Hamilton is not regarded as the act of his party, except as to that portion of it which consisted in signing the Constitution and in aiding its adoption. The issues involved in the fourth decisive crisis in our political fortunes were contested during the presidency of John Adams. The whole of that administration was a political campaign, occupied by bitter and uninterrupted struggles for predominance between the conflicting princi ples of two great parties The most important, although perhaps not the most exciting, of the questions and meas ures in dispute had arisen during the administration of President Washington ; but his presence and participation in the Government held the parties at bay. Political alien ations had then taken place, and wounds had been inflicted Avhich Avere never healed, and bitter fountains sprang up and struggled for an outlet, but they Avere iu a great de gree restrained by that consideration. The leading men"], [258, "236 POLITICAL PARTIES among those who soon after organized the first Republican, now called the old Republican, party, made it a point to abstain from violent action, and to content themselves with protests against measures of which they disapproved, but which they could not defeat. Jefferson gave his opin ion in the cabinet, and Madison made his unausAA-erable speech in the Congress against the bank, and the latter, with other Republicans, spoke strongly against particular features of the funding system, but both measures Avere nevertheless adopted by decisive majorities ; and still, as far as practicable, harsh invective and reproaches against those majorities AA'ere withheld or delayed. The removal of the salient point of attack, by the Avithdrawal of Hamilton from the cabinet, served also to stay partisan outbreaks on the part of the Republicans, Avho were, throughout, not unmind ful of the advantages they would give to their opponents by bringing matters to a crisis Avhilst Washington AA'as at the head of the Government. On the other hand, Hamil ton evidently Avas discouraged by the restrictions imposed upon him by the prudence of Washington. It is apparent that, although by far more confided in, on the score of his great talents, than any other member of the administration, he was yet not allowed the latitude which he thought neces sary to success. No one can read his remarkable letter to Washington (to which I have referred in another connec tion) Avithout perceiving that he was seriously discontented. He thought that there Avere men about the President who interfered Avith and opposed his counsels, and he avoAved his suspicions to that effect in that letter to Washington, Avith the expression of a hope that the latter Avould one day understand those men better. There was, besides, as Jeffer son admits, \" no act of strong mark during the remainder of his \" (Washington's) \" administration that excited much complaint.\""], [259, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 237 Discontents were, therefore, in a great degree, held in abeyance waiting the succession for more active resistance and redress. The arrival of that period \u2014 the retirement of Washington and the election of Adams \u2014 found the field clear for the great contest for Avhich the materials had been gathered and the hearts of the combatants prepared. Mr. Jefferson endeavored, as far as was proper, to pre vent himself from being regarded as a competitor with Mr. Adams, Avhen the latter Avas elected. He wrote to Mr. Madison, requesting him to withdraw his name if there should be an equality of votes between himself and Mr. Adams, which AA'as not an improbable result, assign ing, as a reason, that the latter was greatly his senior in years, and had always stood in advance of him in public life. But notwithstanding the friendly feelings that had existed between them down to that period, their relations soon assumed a very decided character of political oppo sition. Then commenced that fierce partisan struggle Avhich has never been equaled here and seldom, if ever, in any country, either in respect to the gravity and interest of the principles involved, or to the ability and firmness with which the ground of the respective parties was sus tained. A full account of the incidents of this four years' con troversy Avould carry this Avork far beyond the limits of my plan and of my time. My object has been to trace the origin and first organization of our political parties. To this full notices of the early measures out of Avhich they sprang were indispensable. Partisan conflicts upon ques tions that arose after their organization was completed, are to be regarded as effects rather than as causes of their exist ence. The spirit Avhich controls the action of sects and parties, in church or state, is indeed selfish and perverse, becoming more and more characterized by those qualities"], [260, "238 POLITICAL PARTIES the longer they are kept on foot. When a new measure is proposed, or doctrine announced, on either side, the problem presenting itself for deliberation eo instanti to the minds of the opposite faction, is as to the degree of strength and credit which its introduction and success may be ex pected to bring to its authors, and of consequent damage to their own party, \u2014 degrees, of course, dependent upon the extent of its probable advantage to the interests of re ligion, in one case, or of the country, in the other, \u2014 and in such deliberation the claims of religion and country are in great danger of being postponed for the interests of parties, and the neAv doctrine or measure of meeting with a resistance proportioned to its probable merit. It results as a general rule that it is sufficient to induce one party to oppose any given measure to know that it has been intro duced by its adversary. This is an unfavorable and humil iating view of a subject which nevertheless includes great advantages in a free State, but its truth is unhappily too obvious. The angry contests Avhich followed each other in rapid and uninterrupted succession during the administration of the elder Adams, partook strongly of this character. They sprung out of questions Avhich arose after the two great parties of the country \u2014 Avhich have been substantially kept on foot ever since \u2014 had been completely organized and had taken the field, the one to accomplish and the other to resist a great national reform Avhich could only be constitu tionally determined through the medium of a struggle for the succession. Of these I have only noticed the alien and sedition laws, and have been induced to make that dis crimination partly by a conviction of their superior influ ence in settling the fate of parties, but principally from their relation to the report upon the question of their con stitutionality prepared by Madison, under the invigorating"], [261, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 239 stimulus administered by the ever active and zealous mind of Jefferson. Of this great paper I shall speak again. For an account of those interesting partisan conflicts \u2014 which, in comparison Avith the men and issues of the present day, I may, Avithout, I think, being justly re proached with overpraising the past, call a Avar of giants \u2014 the reader cannot, in my judgment, be referred to a source which is in the main more reliable than Randall's \" Life of Jefferson.\" The descendants of that great and good man have contributed to the preparation of that Avork, ap parently Avithout reserve, a body of information of intense interest with Avhich they have been intrusted, and Avhich has never before been made public. With many of the members of this family it has been my good fortune to be come intimately acquainted ; it Avould be difficult to find people anywhere more unobtrusive, notAvithstanding their claims upon the respect and consideration of the com munity, whilst in individual temperament and character they are richly endowed Avith those amiable, truthful, dis interested, and upright traits for which their progenitor was so greatly distinguished in the estimation of those Avho knew him well, and who were disposed to do him justice. Mr. Randall has faithfully embodied the valuable materials furnished by them in his work, to the execution of which he has brought, besides talent and industry, a thoroughly democratic spirit. He has entitled himself to credit for permitting Mr. Jefferson and his contemporaries, as well opponents as coadjutors, to speak for themselves in inspect to public questions generally. If it should be thought in any quarter that his OAvn commentaries betray too much warmth, and are in some instances of too partisan a char acter for the right tone of history, it should be remembered that they fall in those respects far short of the Avriters of the Federal school who have treated of Jefferson ; his"], [262, "240 POLITICAL PARTIES A-olumes may with truth be regarded as the first systematic defense of that statesman's entire political career, and it would not be an easy matter for any one, especially for one of Randall's years, after wading through the volumes of political and personal detraction Avhich have been written against him, to read for the first time vindications authen tic, simple, and conclusive without being sometimes be trayed into expressions Avhich Avould not have been indulged at moments of less excitement. Occasional mistakes in a work of such extent, even with the best intentions, and with what may Avell be regarded as the most reliable sources of information, are still unavoid able. I have elseAvhere corrected a very important one in respect to Mr. Madison's vote on Giles's resolution censur ing the conduct of Hamilton. I dissent also from the in ferences drawn in a few instances from facts about Avhich there is no mistake, \u2014 such as Washington's intentions re specting the rank of the major-generals for the provisional army, and the blame imputed to Jefferson and Madison, \u2014 to the latter for not accepting the office of Secretary of State when the former resigned, and to Jefferson for declininsr Washington's invitation to return to it ; but I have not seen any statement in the Avhole Avork which I do not be lieve Avas intended to be correct, or any construction of ascertained results which does not appear to have been made in good faith. It is conceded on all sides that Hamilton and Jefferson, during the presidency of John Adams, Avere the leaders of the two great parties \u2014 the substantial amalgamation of the old Anti-Federal and Republican parties leaving but tAvo. Hamilton's position was unprecedented. Al though the President and himself were, almost from the commencement of the campaign, upon very bad terms feeling strong personal dislike towards each other, and"], [263, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 241 holding no really friendly intercourse \u2014 he notwithstand ing directed the course of the administration, and con trolled the entire action of the Government to a greater extent than he had done at any time during the presidency of Washington. These extraordinary results he accom plished by means of the complete ascendancy, to which I have heretofore alluded, Avhich he possessed over the three principal members of Mr. Adams's cabinet, \u2014 Pickering, Wolcott and McHenry, \u2014 and by the peculiar influence that he Avas capable of exerting over the Federal members of Congress. I have referred to letters, state papers, briefs, and instructions for the action of those parties establish ing the truth of this position. With very limited excep tions the control of Mr. Adams over his own administra tion Avas little more than nominal. He served the purpose, and that Avas his chief burden, of bearing the responsibility of unpopular measures \u2014 a fortunate circumstance for the Republicans, as he excelled most men in his capacity for adding to the odium of an obnoxious measure by the man ner of executing it. I doubt whether, in the history of the world, another occasion can be found when any two men AA'ere as success ful as were Jefferson and Hamilton in impressing such great numbers of intelligent people with their own opinions and views upon the subjects of government and its proper administration. Acts and avowed opinions speak for themselves, but to determine the motives of parties in the adoption of their measures no safer tests perhaps can be employed than the characters and dispositions of those by Avhom the parties themselves Avere founded and, in their early stages, guided. Hamilton's character, qualifications, and views have already occupied a large space in these pages. If they have been spoken of in any other than a faithful and liberal spirit, I 10"], [264, "242 POLITICAL PARTIES have certainly failed to do justice to my OAvn feelings. Of Thomas Jefferson, the founder as Avell as leader of the old Republican, now Democratic, party, comparatively little has been said. Opposed as they Avere in their opinions upon almost every public question that arose after the adop tion of the Federal Constitution, there Avere yet occasional coincidences of sentiment which served to illustrate the elevated character of their minds, as there Avere also many features of their respective careers which, while broadly contrasted, furnished the strongest evidence of the sin cerity aud integrity of both. Not the least striking among the latter may be found in the circumstances and condi tions of life in which they respectively started in the \"race set before them,\" as connected with the ideas and opinions at which they arrived, so variant from those commonly impressed upon men by similar accidents. Descended from a highly honored stock, it was yet Hamilton's lot to be born poor and to be left solely de pendent upon his OAvn exertions for his success in life. After a service of three years as clerk in a counting-house he was sent to this country for the completion of his edu cation, at the expense of relatives on his mother's side. Here he made himself acquainted with the character of our dispute with the mother country, and took sides Avith the colonists in a manner and under circumstances highly creditable to him, and after five years' military service, in which he acquired great reputation in comparatively sub ordinate stations, he retired to private life, adopting the legal profession as his only resource for the support of his family. That a man trained in such a school, and who at the same time possessed capacities to influence the public mind, when his efforts were properly directed, far superior to any of his contemporaries, would, in the condition in which he"], [265, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 243 Avas placed, and under a government like our oA\\-n, take his political position on the popular side, was an anticipa tion naturally entertained by the zealous friends of repub lican government. But Ave have seen, on the contrary, that there Avas not, throughout the wide extent of the Re public, a single man of respectable standing, more deeply (and, let me add, more sincerely) distrustful of the judg ment and dispositions of the great body of the people, or more anxious to impose restraints upon the popular will, and, for the accomplishment of that object, to add to the intrinsic influence of associated wealth the facilities for its exercise afforded by the possession of political power. His case must not, however, be confounded Avith that of the \" candied tongues \" found in every community which 44 Lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee That thrift may follow fawning.\" Hamilton's mind Avas incapable of that condescension, or, as Mr. Jefferson observed to me of him in connection Avith other matters, \" he Avas far above that.\" He participated largely as a professional man in the favor and patronage of the commercial and manufacturing classes, but instead of his own political course being influenced by the receipt of such favors, he seldom failed to govern theirs. He Avas not a man to mortgage his great abilities for personal benefits of any description, and so Avell was his character in that respect understood that no one would have ven tured to tender him any inducement which might in the estimation of the most prejudiced expose his personal in dependence to the slightest question or suspicion. The fact, therefore, that he pursued a course so different from what might have been naturally expected of him by people generally \u2014 a course so much less eligible for the gratifi cation of ambitious views \u2014 affords high evidence of the"], [266, "244 POLITICAL PARTIES integrity of his motives. It proved that he acted under the influence of opinions which had been honestly formed, and in the correctness of which he confided to the end ; opinions Avhich he doubtless hoped Avould in the sequel proA'e acceptable to the majority, but to which he felt it his duty to adhere, whatever might be the consequences to him self of his perseverance. Mr. Jefferson, on the other hand, succeeded at the age of fourteen, in addition to other rights of primogeniture, to an inheritance Avhich, with competent management, Avas sufficient to satisfy all his wants, and to a social position, when he became a man, which required no pecuniary aids to make his condition in every respect all that Avas desirable, and one that could scarcely be improved by any change in the government of his country. To an unusual extent devoid of the gift of oratory, personal ambition was less likely to tempt him into the paths of politics. Cherish ing always a love of letters, science and the arts, blessed with a genial temper, and in every respect well qualified to adorn and to enjoy the social circle, he seemed des tined for a life of elegant ease. But, happily for the cause of human rights throughout the Avorld, and for the welfare especially of his oavu country, he Avas impressed by his Maker Avith an ardent love of liberty, and a zealous devotion to the generous and equalizing principles of re publican government, Avhich impelled him into the political field, and placed him from the beginning in unreserved hostility to hereditary political poAver in any form, to all institutions in the State which secure to particular classes or individuals a preference over others of equal merit, and to all power in government, or in individuals or associa tions, civil or ecclesiastical, which can be exerted to con trol the opinions or to coerce the consciences of men. Moved by such impulses, and having \" sworn eternal"], [267, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 245 hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man,\" he entered, at an early age, upon his public career, destined to be long and eventful, and sustained throughout the character given of him on his first appearance in Con gress in 177-5, by John Adams, \u2014 \"prompt, frank, explicit, and decisive \" \u2014 \" not even Samuel Adams Avas more so.\" From that time until the day of his death he gave his sup port, never for a moment diminished in zeal or sincerity, and varied only in its efficiency according to the positions he occupied and the influence they afforded for the purpose, to the great principle of \" the equality of political rights \" which Hamilton well described as \" the foundation of pure Republicanism.\" At the age of twenty-two \u2014 a period in Hamilton's life when his already teeming mind was meditating the estab lishment of institutions, and the adoption of measures to strengthen the Government, and to enable it to exercise what he deemed a salutary and necessary restraint upon the popular will, institutions and measures in the work ing of Avhich, from their nature, none but moneyed men could be expected to participate \u2014 Jefferson Avas as actively and constantly employed in the Virginia House of Dele gates, in concert with the earliest Revolutionary patriots of that State, in preparing her, as well as the hearts of the people, for the great movement then already the subject of confident anticipation Avith minds like theirs. There he remained until 177-5, Avhen he Avas appointed a delegate to the Continental Congress. Of his agency, whilst a mem ber of that body, in preparing the Declaration of Independ ence, and in promoting its adoption, it is unnecessary here to speak. As soon as that noble Avork had been accom plished, he resigned his seat, accepted a reelection to the State Legislature as the position in Avhich, though less exalted, he could render more useful services to the cause,"], [268, "246 POLITICAL PARTIES and the measures to \\A-hich his exertions were there directed were in harmony Avith the spirit of the Revolution, and designed, as avowed by himself, \" to eradicate every fibre of ancient or future aristocracy, and to lay a foundation for a government truly republican.\" The results of the joint labors of himself and his patriotic associates were : 1st. An act to prevent the further importation of slaves, a practice which he had denounced in the Declaration of Independence as a \" piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers ; \" 2d. An act to abolish entailments ; 3d. An act to abolish primogenitureship \u2014 a right which had vested in himself; 4th. An act for religious freedom ; and 5th. A bill for general education. These Avere not only appropriate but indispensable steps to lay a sure foundation for republican government, State as Avell as National. Most, if not all of the States, fol lowed her lead, but to Virginia belongs the high merit of having been in this respect the first in the field, anil to Jefferson a large share of that merit. Such were the men who were by common consent placed at the respective heads of the two great parties in that national struggle Avhich resulted in what has ever since been knoAvn as \"the Civil Revolution of Eighteen Hun dred,\" a name given to it by the victors on the assumption that, although the weapons Avere different, the principles which were involved in it and the spirit which achieved the triumph were akin to those which distinguished the Revo lution by the sword. The knoAvledge that Hamilton pre ferred monarchical institutions to every other form, that John Adams, Avho Avas at the head of the Government, sympathized very cordially Avith that sentiment, and the be lief that most of the leaders of the Federal party partook"], [269, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 247 largely of the same feeling, and Avere only prevented from avowing the fact by their perception of its unpopularity, caused a Avide-spread and sincere alarm on the side of the Republican party for the safety of republican government in the United States. This apprehension imparted a graver character to the contest than any other considera tions could have produced, and. called into vigorous action much of the spirit by Avhich the minds of the masses had been influenced in the Revolutionary War. It served to weld the members of the old Anti-Federal party and the Republicans \u2014 betAveen whom a concert of action had pre viously arisen \u2014 into a thorough union, Avhich became per manent, because it AA-as founded on a principle in Avhich they heartily concurred, and which Avas of sufficient magni tude to absorb minor differences in their political vieAvs. That Hamilton's settled opinion and preference were such as I have described is a point which has been, it is hoped, already too well established to admit, at this day, of an honest difference of opinion. He avowed them on the floor of the Convention in the presence of the assem bled representatives, and this is equally clear, Avhether the sum of that declaration is tested by the copy of the speech Avhich he himself delivered to Mr. Madison as a permanent record of his opinions, or by the notes for that speech now published by his son. He announced them to his political rival, Mr. Jefferson, in the presence of Mr. John Adams, and reaffirmed them to the former in a con versation obviously sought for the purpose of giving the form he desired to expressions of a less guarded charac ter, and which were, under that impression, immediately reduced to Avriting by Mr. Jefferson, Avho, for the truth of his record, \" attests the God that made him.\" He so thoroughly impressed his political coadjutor and most trusted friend \u2014 him to whom it was appointed to pro-"], [270, "248 POLITICAL PARTIES nouuce his eulogy at his funeral \u2014 Gouverneur Morris, with a sense of his devotion to monarchical institutions, that within six months after his death, Morris, writing to his friend Ogden, speaks of that devotion as a \" hobby \" which Hamilton \" bestrode to the great annoyance of hi3 friends, and not without injury to himself;\" also to Robert Walsh, the well-known editor of a leading Federal journal, in answer to inquiries on the subject, that \"Hamilton hated republican government because he confounded it Avith democratical government, and he detested the latter be cause he believed it must end in despotism, and be in the mean time destructive to morality ;\" and that \"he never failed on every occasion to advocate the excellence of, and his attachment to, monarchical goA'ernment.\" It was in perfect keeping with the character of Hamilton that never, throughout his life, though constantly charged with enter taining such opinions, did he deny the imputation ; he who denies it now must assume that Hamilton either did not know his oavh mind upon the subject, or that he had some motive for misrepresenting it, or that Mr. Jefferson delib erately falsified his repeated declarations, and that Gouv erneur Morris Avas capable of misrepresenting his friend upon a point of so much importance when that friend had descended to his grave. To what lengths Hamilton Avould have gone to subvert the existing government, and to substitute monarchical in stitutions, or under what circumstances he Avould have deemed an attempt to do so justifiable, are questions open to investigation and comment, but to discuss the fact of his constant preference for such institutions, and desire to see them established here, Avould be to trifle with the subject. Mr. Adams, Avho Avas President, and in whose name the battle was fought, fell but little if any thing short of Gen eral Hamilton in his partiality for the English system. To"], [271, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 249 purge the British Constitution of its corruptions, and to give to its popular branch equality of representation, Avere alone necessary, he thought, to make it \" the most perfect Constitution ever devised by the wit of man.\" The alter ations or amendments he suggested, sound and creditable to himself as they were, Avere no more than qualifications of his general preference for the English model. If Ham ilton's admiration of that model was less qualified than that of Adams, it must at the same time be admitted that the former Avas freest from the fault of seeking to degrade and discredit republican institutions by his Avritings. Without undertaking to describe the specific design of Mr. Adams's \" Defense of the Constitutions of Government of the United States,\" or of his \" Discourse on Davila,\" \u2014 a task, for obvious reasons, very difficult, \u2014 it may, I think, be safely assumed that such Avas their man ifest tendency. Hamilton at least thought so at a time when the reciprocal prejudices which afterwards separated them so widely had not yet acquired a strong hold upon the feelings of either. In his interview Avith Mr. Jeffer son on the 13th of August, 1791, before referred to, when the conversation Avas turned to the writings of Mr. Adams, Hamilton condemned them, anil \"most particularly Davila, as having a tendency to weaken the present Government;\" and, after other remarks in relation to the existing Govern ment and its chances of success, he added, \u2014 \" Whoever by his Avritings disturbs the present order of things is really blamable, however pure his intentions might be, and he was sure Mr. Adams's Avere pure.\" The division by Mr. Adams of governments designated as republics, into democratic republics, aristocratic repub lics and monarchical, or regal republics, \u2014 embracing a minute description of each, in which the Government of the \" United Provinces of the Loav Countries,\" whose"], [272, "250 POLITICAL PARTIES poAvers are held by the persons intrusted Avith them either by hereditary title or by the selection of associates, after the manner of close corporations, is called a \" democratic Republic,\" and that of England a \" monarchical, or regal Republic,\" \u2014 AA-as naturally displeasing to the sense and feeling of those who regarded aristocratical or monarch ical or regal features as absolutely incompatible with the true idea of republican government. The voluminous and doubtless violent attacks that AA'ere made upon his Avritings were scarcely necessary to satisfy those who had freely undergone the sufferings and sacrifices of a long and bloody war to secure to themselves and their posterity the blessings of republican institutions, according to their acceptation of them, that the Avritings of Mr. Adams were designed, as was charged, to cause the term \" Republican Government \" to mean \" any thing or nothing.\" The notices taken of the general subject and of these writings in particular, by John Adams himself, by his son, John Quincy Adams, and by his grandson, Charles Francis Adams, go far to show that if not fairly liable to this con struction, they Avere too much open to it to be persisted in. In a note attached by the author, in 1812, to the \"Dis course on Davila,\" as published in his \" Life and Works,\" he says : \" The AA-ork, however, poAverfully operated upon his (J. A.'s) popularity. It Avas urged as full proof that he Avas an advocate for monarchy, and laboring to intro duce a hereditary President in the United States.\" His grandson, Charles F. Adams, introducing the \"Discourse\" in his \"Life and Works of John Adams,\" says: \" They furnished to the partisans of the day so much material for immediate political use in the contest then beginning (1790), that the author thought it best to desist, and they Avere left incomplete.\" John Quincy Adams, in his Jubilee Address, \u2014 the oc-"], [273, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 251 casion and character of Avhich have been heretofore noticed, \u2014 describes the state of parties at the accession of Gen eral Washington to the Presidency in the following terms: \" On the other hand no small number of the Federalists, sickened by the wretched and ignominious failure of the Articles of Confederation to fulfill the promise of the Rev olution ; provoked at once and discouraged by the violence and rancor of the opposition against their strenuous and toilsome endeavors to raise their country from her state of prostration ; chafed and goaded by the misrepresentations of their motives, and the reproaches of their adversaries, and imputing to them in turn deliberate and settled pur poses to dissolve the Union and resort to anarchy for the repair of ruined fortunes, \u2014 distrusted ever the efficacy of the Constitution itself, and with a Aveakened confidence in the virtue of the people were inclined to the opinion that the only practicable substitute for it would be a government of greater energy than that presented by the Convention. There were among them numerous warm admirers of the British Constitution, disposed to confide rather to the in herent strength of the Government than to the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence for the preserva tion of the rights of property and perhaps of persons.\" This is language Avhich it is easy to understand, and which covers very fairly the subject of our immediate at tention. Few men enjoyed better opportunities to possess himself of correct views in regard to the opinions of his own political party than John Quincy Adams. He was by nature truthful, or if at times blinded by prejudice, never, I firmly believe, induced to swerve by sinister considera tions. Accustomed from early life to indulgence in the strono- expressions (both in manner and form) common to his race, he was apt to exaggerate under great excitement, but was not capable of designedly falsifying facts. Iu"], [274, "252 POLITICAL PARTIES the case before us the greatest reliance may be placed upon his statements in regard to the opinions and views of a class of men of Avhom he thought well. The Federal party entered upon the first administration under the new Constitution, of which the election had placed it in full possession, with a Aveakened confidence, Mr. Adams says, in the virtue of the people, \u2014 distrustful even of the effi cacy of the Constitution itself, and iuclined to the opinion that the only practical substitute for it would be a govern ment of greater energy than that presented by the Con vention, and a portion of them (hoAv large it Avas difficult for manifest reasons to determine, but Mr. Adams describes it as \" numerous,\") warmly admiring the British Constitu tion, and 'disposed to confide to the inherent strength of such a government rather than to one founded on the principles of the Declaration of Independence. In Avhat class or division it was the intention of Mr. Adams to place his venerable father does not appear, nor is it very clear to Avhich he should be assigned. That he considered his opinions, which had been more impugned in all respects than those of any, save perhaps of Hamilton, as not plac ing him in either, is not at all probable. John Adams's \" Defense \" and \" Discourse \" Avere Avrit ten at different periods remote from each other, and Avhen he himself occupied very different situations ; the former before the formation of the Federal Constitution, Avhen he represented his country as Minister to England, and the latter, Avhich Avas universally regarded as the most Anti- Republican of the two, after he had been elected Vice- President. That his views Avere in some degree changed by time and circumstances is not improbable. Mr. Jeffer son thought that he oAved his support for the Vice-Presi dency to the Anti-Republican tendencies of the first Avork, and that his election to that office and the federal senti-"], [275, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 253 ment that he found prevalent on his return from England, and doAvn to the commencement of the new government, induced him to Avrite the \" Discourse,\" and to give to it a higher tone in the same direction. The diffusive and (if that expression is not too strong when speaking of Avritings of so much learning and ability) the incoherent manner in Avhich these Avorks Avere constructed, particularly the earlier one, makes it unsafe to venture to specify the precise prin ciples they Avere desigued to sustain. His grandson Avas so sensible of the deficiencies of the \" Defense \" in these respects that he reconstructed and improved it in his pub lication, but without, as he says, changing the sense, and I have no doubt that he has carried out the latter idea in good faith. That few if any American citizens Avent beyond John Adams in his admiration of the British Constitution is un deniably true. In the third chapter of the \" Defense,\" \u2014 (see Vol. IV., p. 358, of his \" Life and Works,\") he pro nounces an eulogium on that Constitution Avhich goes far beyond that reported by Mr. Jefferson, (in his account of the conversation between Adams and Hamilton in April, 1791,) calling it \"the most stupendous fabric of human in vention,\" adding, that \"not the formation of languages, not the whole art of navigation and ship-building, does more honor to the human understanding than this system of government.\" But on the very next page he commends the United States for not having followed the English model, so far as to make \" their first magistrates or their senators hereditary \" \u2014 differing substantially in that re gard from the opinion reported by Mr. Jefferson, and showing hoAv unsafe if not futile would be the attempt to define exactly the principles AA'hich he favored. It may, notwithstanding, be safely assumed, first, that he Avas foremost among the warm admirers of the Brit-"], [276, "254 POLITICAL PARTIES ish Constitution spoken of by his son, and secondly, that he deemed our Constitution defective in omitting to pro vide for some depository of political power in the gov ernment, variant in principle from its general provisions, one which should be either not at all or only very remotely subject to popular control, and that he stood almost at the head of those Avhose confidence in the virtue of the people had been greatly Aveakened by occurrences following the Revolution. The latter assumption Avould seem very fully Avarranted by the folloAving citations from his \" Defense : \" ' \" The proposition, that the people are the best keepers of their own liberties, is not true ; they are the Avorst con ceivable ; they are no keepers at all ; they can neither judge, act, think, or will as a political body.\" \" If it is meant by our author a representative assem bly, they are not still the best keepers of the liberties of the people ; at least the majority Avould invade the liberty of the minority sooner and oftener than an absolute mon archy.\" \" A great Avriter has said that a people will never op press themselves, or invade their own rights.

When men arise Avho to real services add political empiricism, conform to the errors of the peo ple, comply Avith their prejudices, gain their hearts and excite their enthusiasm, then gratitude is a contagion \u2014 it is a whirlwind.\" The same volume (of Randall's Work) contains copious extracts from the letters of Fisher Ames and a number of other leading Federalists, derived from Hamilton's re cently published papers and other sources. They breathe in general the same spirit, hankering after pre-revolution ary institutions and systems, though less boldly expressed than was done by Hamilton and Adams, and the same dis trust of the sufficiency of the Constitution and above all of the capacities and dispositions of the people, the latter exhibited in assaults upon democracy and the democratic spirit of the country. John Adams was in every sense a remarkable man. Nature seems to have employed in his construction intel lectual materials sufficient to have furnished many minds respectably. It would not be easy to name men, either of his day or of any period, whose characters present a deeper or a stronger soil, one which during his long and some what boisterous public life was thoroughly probed by hi3 enemies without disclosing any variation in its depths from the qualities and indications of its surface. Still more deeply was it turned up and exposed to the light by him self with the same result. His writings, which have been more extensive and more various than those of any of his contemporaries, have been given to the world apparently without reserve. These, with his diaries and autobiogra phy, have turned his character inside out and shown us, without disguise of any sort, the kind of man he was : and the representation is invariably that of the same \" al ways honest man \" that he was three quarters of a century"], [278, "256 POLITICAL PARTIES ago Avhen that high praise AA-as accorded to him by his not too partial friend, Benjamin Franklin, in a communication not designed to be over civil. Whatever diversities may have arisen in the opinions of men in relation to the merits or demerits of his after con duct, all agree in conceding to him credit for patriotic and useful services in the times Avhich have been happily de scribed as those Avhich tried men's souls. Mr. Jefferson, but two years before the death of both of them, on refer ring to that period, and to Mr. Adams's great services, in my presence, Avas warmed by the subject, and spoke of him as having been the mainmast of the ship \u2014 the orator of the Revolution, &c.

This is a high distinc tion \u2014 one which entitles his memory to the perpetual reverence of his countrymen. No subsequent errors of opinion, nothing short of personal dishonor and degrada tion, of which he Avas incapable, could extinguish a claim to the enduring gratitude and respect of a nation founded on such services.

The dissatisfaction of the latter Avas not a little increased by the circumstance that sentiments and opinions, so dis paraging to a form of government Avhich had been the unceasing object of their desire, should have been ostenta tiously promulgated in a country and in the presence of a government from Avhich the right to establish it had been wrested by arms, and on the part of which the most un friendly feelings in respect to our advancement were still entertained. It was, nevertheless, true that no circumstance contributed more toward his selection by the Federal party as their candidate for the office of Vice-President than these very avowals. His own sense of their efficacy in that respect is clearly to be inferred from the fact that he devoted the first moments of his time, Avhilst occupying that station, to the prosecution of the same general object, with less disguise and increased boldness, through his \" Discourses on Davila.\" Jefferson and Samuel Adams and others of their stamp, AA'ho had embarked in the Revolution with a spirit that could neither be appalled by danger whilst the battle raged, nor seduced by considerations of any description after it had been fought, were not sIoav in perceiving that Mr. Adams had not only deserted from the cause of free gov ernment, but that he regarded his first success under the new system and aspired to the still higher honor in the gift of his countrymen as fruits of his desertion. Whilst his early and best friends felt that the fabric, the erection of which had cost them so much labor and so many sacrifices, had lost one of its strongest pillars by his falling off, they were neither dismayed nor did they despair of its safety. They met his second attempt to bring free governments into disrepute Avith an energy that drove him, as he him- 17"], [280, "258 POLITICAL PARTIES self admits, stubborn and inflexible in his purposes as he always had been, to discontinue, at least in that form, as saults upon a political faith, once the object of their com mon devotion. This desertion on the part of one in Avhom they had confided so fully, and upon Avhose cooperation, in securing to them the full enjoyment of the political rights for the acquisition of which they had endured so many perils, they had largely depended, sank deeply into the hearts and minds of the people. The spirit of discontent was naturally much increased by the discovery that Hamil ton, who had done himself so much honor, and who had raised such favorable anticipations by the chivalrous spirit and gallantry Avith which he had embraced and sustained the national cause Avas, after all, irreconcilably hostile to that system of republican government Avhich they so highly prized, and upon the ultimate enjoyment of Avhich they had so long meditated ; that his opposition Avas not only open and unreserved, but that he assigned as a reason for it their incapacity and unfitness for the support and enjoyment of free institutions. A sense of danger to the cause of republicanism in the United States Avas widely diffused through the public mind. There Avere indignities to be resented and Avrongs to be re dressed, besides new securities to be devised for the safety of long-cherished principles. These Avere considerations quite sufficient to rouse the lion of the Revolution from his lair to defend its choicest fruit from further profanation. Those classes, among the surviving patriots of that event ful day, of whom I have spoken as pervaded by a deeper hatred of kingly government than others among their Revolutionary associates, sprang to the rescue with alacrity and zeal. The descendants of the devoted spirits who first settled the ancient colony of Virginia were not unmind ful of their hereditary obligations to resist the exercise of"], [281, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 259 laA\\less poAver. Neither could the appeal fall unheeded on the ears of the representatives of the persecuted Hugue nots, Avho had suffered so cruelly from the exercise of powers now sought to be revived, or of the Netherlanders of the Middle States, or on those sons of the Puritans of the East Avhose zeal in behalf of liberty had not been tempted to spend itself on trade and manufactures by the seductive influence of Hamilton's policy, and by the facil ities they possessed for those pursuits. Drawing its poAver from such sources, and sustained by a great preponderance of the landed interest in every part of the country, the old Republican party attained a degree of vigor and efficiency superior to that of any partisan organization which had before or has since appeared on the political stage. Mr. John Quincy Adams described it truly Avhen he said that it had acquired a head Avhich would have enabled it, if so disposed, \" to have overthrown Wash ington's administration as it did that of his successor act ing upon its principles.\" Jefferson's declaration to Mazzei that \"Ave have only to awake and snap the Lilliputian cords with which they have attempted to bind us during the first slumbers that succeed our labors,\" Avas borne out by the result. Although the audacious passion for monarchical govern ment, Avhich the leading Federalists had ventured to revive so soon after the Revolution, Avas the most exciting of the causes which inflamed the hearts and braced the nerves of the Republicans for the conflict,1 that was not the first issue to be tried. The nature of the government to be substi tuted Avas a question that would not, in the natural order of things, arise until the fate of the existing Constitution 1 See Life of Morris, Vol. III. p. by some of them to believe that they 128. 44 But the thing which in my wish to establish a monarchy.\" \u2014 opinion has done more mischief to Letter from Morris to King. the Federal party is the ground given"], [282, "260 POLITICAL PARTIES had been settled ; but as their blood Avas up and their hands at work, the Republicans resolved, if possible, to strangle the conspiracy against the neAV-born liberties of the country in both its branches by the same effort. The severity and success of the blows they directed against the restoration of the power and influence of the Crown, in any form, is strikingly illustrated by a comparison of the state in Avhich that question Avas found and that in Avhich it was left by the civil revolution of 1800. Whilst at the former period the superiority of kingly over republican government Avas the prevailing and absorbing sentiment among what Avere called the higher classes, as graphically described by Mr. Jefferson, and substantially corroborated by Gouverneur Morris's letter to Rufus King, the notion that the former would be ever practicable in this country was so thoroughly annihilated by that great struggle as never again to have been whispered in our politics. There is no exaggeration in the affirmation that there has been no day Avithin the last forty years Avhen a proposition for the reestablishment of monarchy in the United States, how ever seriously made, could have excited any other emotion than ridicule or contempt, or would not have been deemed more appropriately punished by the administration of the straight-jacket than by a trial for treason. But there has been far greater difficulty in completing the work of resist ance to Hamilton's efforts to overthrow the Constitution by subverting it, through the agency of his sapping and min ing policy, which was the direct issue in the election of 1800. A constitution had been established, in the con struction and ratification of which the Federal party had performed a greater and more effectual part than the party opposed to it. Its general provisions were fully adequate to the support of a republican government. By a success ful incorporation of the representative system Avith the"], [283, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 261 republican form, pure aud simple, its framers had happily qualified and adapted the instrument to our extensive terri tory, and a provision for amendments furnished a remedy against existing defects. Of the latter the omission to secure specifically and adequately the individual natural rights of men against the exercise of arbitrary poAver was the most important \u2014 a defect in respect to Avhich a large majority of the Anti-Federalists were, for reasons fre quently referred to, most sensitive. The Constitution Avas ratified by several of the States, and amongst them by Virginia and NeAv York, with accompanying resolutions, some of them passed by the State conventions with perfect unanimity, expressing opinions that it deserved revision and required amendments. Without such resolutions the ratification could not, we are forced to believe, have been effected. We have seen with Avhat reluctance the first Congress, Federal by a large majority, consented to make any constitutional amendments, and that nothing short of Mr. Madison's Avonderful perseverance could, in all proba bility, have effected their adoption ; but they were obtained, proved satisfactory to the Anti-Federalists, and made them fast friends of the new Constitution. . From that moment that instrument ceased to be an object of solicitude with the leaders of the Federal party, hardly retaining favor Avith any of them. This result is by no means an unusual one in the history of parties Avhose feel ings have become to any great extent embittered. The instances are rare indeed in Avhich any public measure or act is at the same time entirely acceptable to all sides. The \" Independent Treasury \" is the only clear case of the kind among us that has fallen under my observation.

This Avas justly their due. It is not to be doubted that several of them, as I have before said, participated largely in Hamilton's objections, and would have preferred a very different instrument; but they knew that none less favorable to the supposed interests of the State governments, or less liberal in other respects, would stand the slightest chance of ratification, more especially when the circumstance of disregard to the limits and restrictions of the authority by which they had been convened was taken into consideration. They saw nothing but injury, vast and complicated, to the country from their failure, and they evinced their patriotism in yielding to this wise foresight at the sacrifice of their individual pref erences.

In the whole range of measures, Avhich, if constitutional, might appropriately proceed from his department, he could not have found a single one as to which the intention of the framers of the Constitution, adA'erse to the power he exercised, was better understood than a United States Bank. Mr. Jefferson brought the facts which transpired in the Convention proving such intention to his notice, and to that of the President, and they were not controverted by either. So in regard to the Sedition Law. One of the ten amendments was especially designed to prohibit such legis- ation, and there were no subjects to which the Anti-Feder alists and Republicans were more alive than to the liberty of speech and of the press. The same thing may be said, in respect to public sensibilities, of the Alien Act. That Act conferred a power on the President, AA'hich, though one of the prerogatives of the Crown, no prime minister dare exercise at this day in the sense in which the President Avas authorized to exercise it. Yet it is now known that of these last measures the first was passed upon Hamilton's suggestion, and Mr. Charles F. Adams informs us that neither was ever made the subject of executive consultation. But I can well conceive that these considerations, which might deter other men, were but so many recommendations with Hamilton for the course he pursued. From first to last he thought the Constitution inadequate to the purposes of what he regarded as good government, and that the sooner it Avas gotten rid of the better for the country. There Avere moments when he allowed himself to hope that he might make it answer the purpose if he were al lowed to go on Avith it as he began. But these were only"], [286, "264 POLITICAL PARTIES momentary impressions that soon gave way to the settled convictions of his mind, his avowals of Avhich AA-ere uni formly the same. He declared to Jefferson in 1792, \" that the Constitution was a shilly-shally thing of mere milk and Avater, and Avas only good as a step to something bet ter,\" \u2014 a declaration Avhich the latter communicated in self-defense to Washington; and in 1802 he describes it to his friend Morris, as we have seen, as \" a frail and worth less fabric,\" reminding him at the same time of his knoAvl edge that such had been his (Hamilton's) opinion \" from the very beginning.\" It Avas, therefore, natural that a man of his intelligence and resolution, looking with entire con fidence to its failure, should think it expedient to select the most palpable as well as the most flagrant violations of the Constitution, while it was yet in its infancy a:,d feeblest condition, and thus to prepare the public mind for the degradation he had in store for it, and to insure its speedy overthrow. These severe measures Avere rendered doubly odious by the manner in which the Sedition Law was executed, and by the steps adopted to suppress outbreaks of popular dis content, but which only SAvelled comparative rivulets into resistless torrents and rendered the Republican cause in valuable service by giving occasion to Madison's great Report on the Constitutionality of the Alien and Sedition Laws. The judgment of the country has ever been that a more able state paper never issued from the pen of any man. It covered the entire controversy between the two parties, traced its origin to the different vieAvs they entertained of the construction and obligatory character of the Constitution, and placed the republican creed in those respects upon grounds absolutely impregnable. Hamilton was a laborious writer, but only so because his writings were so voluminous; to Avrite was with him a labor of"], [287, "265 IN THE UNITED STATES. love, and there Avas no man of his day who devoted more time to political disquisitions. There Avas scarcely any other great public question that occupied the public mind during that period on which a publication, offensive or de fensive, is not to be found in his Works. Yet if he ever attempted a reply to that Report, Avhich attracted general attention and became the flag under which the Republicans fought, I have never seen or heard of it. I may safely assume that he never did make such attempt. The issue was fairly presented by Mr. Madison, through the Virginia Legislature, as depending upon the answers to the following questions : \u2014 1. What are the true principles that should be applied to the construction of the Constitution \\ 2. Are those Avho are elected by the people bound to execute it according to the intention of its framers and the understanding of those who ratified it 3. Is it in that sense sacredly obligatory upon all AA'ho are subject to its authority 1 The charge presented against the Federal party and its representatives was that they had trampled upon the sanc tity of the Constitution by the application to its construc tion of principles known to be unsound, by setting at defiance the intentions of those Avho made it and for whom it Avas made, and by prostituting it, and claiming the right to prostitute it, to the promotion of their particular views of the public interests, regardless of such intentions, how ever well understood. This Report stands as a perpetual record of that issue. The Republicans regarded its decision as involving the ex istence of republican government, inasmuch as no such government could be sustained for a moment longer than the Constitution Avas looked to as a sacred and inviolable line of duty for both rulers and ruled. They triumphed"], [288, "266 POLITICAL PARTIES in the great contest, and they expelled from poAver the men Avho refused to recognize that principle in the administra tion of the government, and for that reason they placed in their stead those Avho would recognize it. Madison's Report presented a faithful synopsis of the principles of the old Republicans upon fundamental ques tions, \u2014 those Avhich relate to the poAvers of government and to the responsibilities under which they should be ex ercised, \u2014 the only questions which gave rise to permanent political parties. Whilst divisions in regard to particular measures disappear Avith the falling off' of interest in the subjects of them, those which I have described as growing out of such primordial tenets are kept alive as long as the government itself endures. So it has been in all countries where there has been any appreciable degree of freedom of opinion. England is almost, if not altogether, the only country whose institutions are sufficiently analogous to ours to admit of useful comparisons. From the time Avhen her sovereigns traced their authority from God, and acknowledged responsibility to Him alone for the manner of its exercise, to the Revolution of 1688, by Avhich abso lutism was forever abolished and government declared to be a trust for the abuse of which the sovereign is respon sible to the people, and always since, her party divisions, regarded as national, have had relation to the powers of government and to the degrees of responsibility under Avhich they should be exercised. Whether these parties Avere called Cavaliers and Roundheads, Presbyterians and Jaco bites, Whig and Tory, or Conservatives and Liberals, such have always been the essential dividing points. Like our selves they have had a succession of exciting public questions not of this character which have for a time divided the com munity, and Avere earnestly contested, but Avhich passed away AA'ithout making material inroads upon ancient party"], [289, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 267 divisions, and the latter resumed their sAvay Avhen the tem porary interruption ceased in much the same general array they Avould have presented if it had not occurred. I have said that Madison's report was the flag under which the Republicans conquered. It defines the consti tutional creed by Avhich they Avere influenced in the admin istration of the government for twenty-four years suc cessively, and under Avhich the Democratic party, their successors, have since held the reins of the Federal Gov ernment, with infrequent exceptions \u2014 the latter never ex tending to two Presidential terms, and always the result of special circumstances having little bearing upon general politics. But the political seed sown by Hamilton has not in other respects proved as perishable as have his teachings in favor of monarchical institutions. The former has never been eradicated \u2014 it seems not susceptible of eradication. I have given the reasons Avhy this has been so Avith a de scription of the fruit it has continued to produce. These results have fostered kindred doctrines in respect to consti tutions, their sanctity, their uses, and their .abuses. I have also said that these doctrines have been ever cherished and enforced Avhen circumstances were auspicious, and have constituted the chief element of our party divisions. Hence it has been that those divisions have been so uni form^in their general outlines. The opposite dispositions which lead men to take different sides upon such questions have worked to the same ends from the close of the Revo lution, and have been developed on all occasions of a nature to call them into action. The execution of the present Federal Constitution presented an opportunity to give them a definite and more permanent form and clas sification which they have maintained ever since. Indi viduals have changed from side to side under the influence"], [290, "268 POLITICAL PARTIES of what they have regarded as stronger inducements, and when they have been disappointed, have generally returned to their first bias. Questions of public policy, disconnected from considerations of constitutional poAver, have arisen, been discussed, decided or abandoned and forgotten, whilst the political parties of the country have remained as they were. With the authentic record before us of the issue, the contest, the result, and the efforts on the part of the 'defeated party to recover the ground it had lost, the sup position seems preposterous that our party divisions had their origin in the circumstances that occurred on the ap pointment of General Washington to be Commander-in- Chief of our Revolutionary army, as is alleged by a son of General Hamilton, in his history of the life of his father. Of the same character, though not quite so unreasonable, are the attempts Avhich have been made by several to find their origin in the Federal Convention. That body did in deed present an occasion for the .application of different opinions to the original formation of the Federal Consti tution, but those opinions grew out of conflicting tenets Avhich had divided the country into parties long before, and they were not then determined either way, but compro mised upon grounds of expediency by a result which Avas not in point of fact satisfactory to any side, but acquiesced in by a majority obtained from the ranks of both. ' The proposition of President John Quincy Adams in his In augural Address, tracing their rise to the opposing sides taken by the people of the United States, as between Eng land and France, and their final discontinuance to the dis astrous career and termination of the French Revolution, would seem to be not less Avide of the mark. The continu ance of the two great parties of the country in the same"], [291, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 269 state, in respect to the principles they espoused and the characters and dispositions of those Avho composed them, for more than half a century and for a quarter of a cen tury before his address was delivered, is not to be denied. If it was even supposed possible that an intelligent and high spirited people like our own, Avith traditions and a history so eventful, and with domestic interests so import ant, could have been arrayed in hostile political opinions and party divisions by the influence of purely foreign questions, the continuance of those divisions in the same form and spirit for so many years after all pretence of the operation of such an influence had ceased Avould of itself he sufficient to refute the theory. But the objections to it are too numerous, too conclusive in their character, and too obvious to make it necessary to press them farther. The French Revolution had sufficiently developed itself to weaken, if not extinguish, the solicitude of the Republicans for its success, (Avho, with their leader, Thomas Jefferson, regarded its excesses with abhorrence,) before they expelled John Adams from the Presidency for the aid and sanction which he gave to Hamilton's violations of the Constitution, and his son, John Quincy Adams, Avas twenty-eight years afterwards driven from poAver for the same cause and by the same party, a party Avhich he supposed had ceased to exist for some thirty years previous. It Avas by his lati tudinarian avoAvals in respect to the constitutional powers of Congress, \u2014 Avhen he began to talk of erecting \" light houses of the skies,\" and of the folly of paralyzing rep resentatives by the will of their constituents, \u2014 that his political destiny Avas sealed. That existing political divisions among the people of the United States induced the formation of preferences and prejudices in respect to England and France, was, doubt less, true, but to suppose that these constituted the founda-"], [292, "270 POLITICAL PARTIES tion of their own divisions is to mistake for the cause one of its least important effects. The Anti-Federal, Republican, and Democratic parties have been from the beginning composed of men entertain ing the same general views in regard to the most desirable form of government, and to the spirit in which, and the objects for Avhich, it should be administered. The morbid feelings of large portions of the old Anti-Federalists pro duced by their distrust of delegated poAver, founded on their knowledge of the extent to Avhich it had been every where abused, led to a difference between them and the Republicans on the question of clothing the Federal Gov ernment with poAver to collect its OAvn revenues, to regulate commerce, &c, and induced them to oppose the ratification of the neAv Constitution on that account, and on account of its deficiencies in regard to proper securities for personal rights. Their party Avas thereby broken down, but Jeffer son and Samuel Adams, and men like them, succeeded in satisfying them of their error in respect to the outlines of the Constitution, and Madison procured the adoption of amendments that obviated their other objections aud, as I have before said, a cordial and enduring union was formed betAveen them and the Republicans, under the latter name. Since that period the party has undergone no change, either in its organization, its principles, or the general political dispositions of the individuals of Avhich it has been composed. Its name has been changed from Republican to Democratic, in consequence of the increasing popular devel opment of its course and principles, and in some degree by the circumstance that its old opponent had assumed the name of Federal Republican and by a natural desire to keep the line of demarcation between them as broad and as well defined as possible. The formation and ratification of the Federal Consti-"], [293, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 271 tution, mainly through Federal agency, the union of the Anti-Federalists and Republicans and the cordial accept ance of the Constitution, after its amendment, by both, presented, at the commencement of Washington's adminis tration, the fairest opportunity for a real \"era of good feeling \" that the country has ever knoA\\-n. All contro versy upon fundamental questions having been removed, the doors seemed to be thrown open for an amalgamation of parties like that of Avhich so much was said, and Avith so little result, during the administration of Mr. Monroe. Without any open question affecting permanently every interest, and all the people and all alike, as is the case with such as relate to and embrace the sources of power and the foundations of the government, if the Constitution had been upheld in good faith on both sides partisan con tests must of necessity have been limited to local or tem porary and evanescent measures and to popular excitements and opposing organizations as shifting and short-lived as the subjects Avhich gave rise to them. But Hamilton took especial care that such halcyon days should not even daAvn on the country. He had a riveted conviction \u2014 a convic tion he took no pains to conceal \u2014 that the Constitution must prove a signal failure, unless it could be made to bear measures little dreamed of by those Avho made and had adopted it ; and in his view of the Avelfare of the country that question could not be too soon decided. The name and influence of Washington Avas an element of strength toward the accomplishment of his project in that regard, upon which he had expressed a strong reliance in the letter now published by his son, Avithout date but written be tAveen the formation and ratification of the Constitution, and he was, of course, desirous to bring all such questions to an early decision, as Washington's long continuance in office Avas far from probable. He, therefore, promptly"], [294, "272 POLITICAL PARTIES seized his opportunity, and at the earliest suitable moment after the organization of the new Government, proposed the incorporation of a national bank. I have already said, and given my reasons for the assertion, that in the whole range of the affairs of the government committed to his charge, he could not have taken a single step which Avould have afforded such unmistakable evidence of his determina- tion not to be controled in his administration of the gov- ernment under the neAv Constitution by the inteutions of those who framed, or of those who ratified it ; not one more likely to revive former distrusts, and to infuse new jealousies among the Anti-Federalists in respect to his hos- tility to republican principles, or better calculated to give neAv strength to their energies Avhen the proper time ar- rived for the blast of the trumpet that called every man to his tent. His old friend, Madison, Avas one of the first to take up the gauntlet thus boldly thrown before the sincere friends of the Constitution. This Avas done by his masterly and unanswerable speech in Congress against the constitu- tionality of the bank. No one can make himself acquainted with Mr. Madison's course, and Avith the state of his feel ing towards President Washington at that period, and fail to appreciate the regret and pain he suffered from the per formance of that act of duty, not on his own account but from his extreme reluctance to be placed in the attitude of opposition to one for whom he cherished feelings of such unbounded respect and affection, and whose confidence he fully enjoyed. But for the strong and audacious move ments of Hamilton, there is every reason to believe that Mr. Madison Avould have cooperated very cordially in the support of President Washington's admininistration throughout. In respect to mere questions of expediency, he Avould haA'e done all in his power to give them the most desirable form and direction, and, if disappointed, Avould, doubtless, have been silent as to the result."], [295, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 273 CHAPTER VI.

To accomplish these objects the measures they have from time to time advocated have been brought into view ; opinions they have advanced partially discussed, and the means that have been employed to make them effectual considered. The general subject, considering the* interest and the importance attached to it in several aspects, has been but 18"], [296, "274 POLITICAL PARTIES little canvassed, and is at best but imperfectly understood. The most important points put in issue, so far as they have arisen out of principles advanced or pretenses set up by either party prior to the election of 1800, haA'e, it is be lieved, been fully, and, it is hoped, fairly presented. Here, on account of the unforeseen extent to which the subject has grown upon my hands, it Avould be my wish to dismiss it and to resume the thread of my Memoirs at the point at Avhich I left it for the consideration of Avhat I then regarded as incidental matter. To do so has been my in tention through the last two hundred pages of my manu script. But, at the stage to Avhich I had looked as the termination of this branch of my labors, I am met by the reflection that in all I have said in respect to the doctrines, theories, and acts of parties, I have not even touched upon a great principle subsequently advanced for the action of the Federal Government, Avhich, for reasons that will be seen and appreciated as we proceed, is of equal interest, and which, from considerations of recent application, is perhaps of more urgent importance than those upou which my attention has been bestowed. I allude to the effort which has been made to secure to one of the three great departments of the Government \u2014 the judicial \u2014 a superior aud controlling power over its departmental associates, the executive and the legisla tive, all of which were designed by the Constitution to be coordinate, and, in respect to their relative powers, independent of each other. This pretension, though suc cessfully discouraged at its origin, instead of sharing the fate of other constitutional heresies which sprang from the same source, has been revived with increased ear nestness at critical periods, and at this time seems to threaten to exert a dangerous influence upon our political system."], [297, "275 IN THE UNITED STATES. I have not noticed it before, because it Avas not set up until after the great struggle of 1800, and AA'as thus separ ated from the questions Avhich originated under the previ ous administration, most of which have been agitated to the present day, and because the period of its most impos ing if not its first introduction into the political arena, unconnected with judicial proceedings, \u2014 that of President Jackson's veto against the passage of the Bank Bill, \u2014 occurred at a later period than that to Avhich my account of political movements has been brought in my Me moirs. It has from the beginning been the constant aim of the leading Federalists to select some department, or some nook or corner in our political system, and to make it the depository of power which public sentiment could not reach nor the people control. The judicial was not the depart ment which Hamilton deemed the best adapted to that end, and his opinion upon such poiuts seldom failed to become that of his party. He liked the judiciary as Avell on ac count of its being the only branch of the Government that Avas constituted, in regard to the tenure of office, upon the principles he preferred, and Avhich he had proposed in the Convention for other offices also, as on account of its use fulness in protecting the rights of persons and property against vicious legislation or laAvless violence. But regard ing the exercise of its powers in no other light than through its judgments in cases \" in law and equity \" that Avere brought before it by parties litigant, the only sense in which they Avere regarded by the framers of the Constitu tion, he thought it too Aveak a department for his purpose. This Avas nominally to influence, but really to control, the action of the public mind \u2014 an object which, he never hesi tated to declare, could only be effected by appeals to the interests or the fears of the people, and the judicial power"], [298, "276 POLITICAL PARTIES did not possess the means to make either effectual. This opinion of the Aveakness of the judicial power he frequently avoAved, and particularly in the 78th No. of the \"Federalist.\" The judiciary, he there said, \" Avas incontestibly the weakest of the three departments of power ; \" \u2014 that \" though in dividual oppression might now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people could never be endangered from that quarter ; \" \u2014 that it had \" no influence over either the SAvord or the purse ; no direction either of the strength or of the Avealth of the society ; and can take no active resolution Avhatever. It may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment ; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm for the efficacious exercise even of this faculty.\" In support of these views he cited Montesquieu, who, speaking of them says : \"Of the three poivers above mentioned, the Judiciary is next to nothing.\" Thus re garding the judicial department, Hamilton selected the executive and legislative as those best adapted to his purposes. Of the means which those departments pos sessed he spoke in the same number of the \" Federalist\" in the following strain : \" The executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the swx>rd of the community ; the legislative not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated.\" These were the departments, through the instrumentality of Avhich, invigorated as he designed to invigorate them by his construction of the Constitution, he hoped to make ours a practicable government. Sus tained by a Congress, a majority of whom stood ready to follow his lead, and by the almost unbouuded confidence of the executiA'e, he for a season carried out his plans with great success, and enjoyed that momentary confidence which produced his jubilant remark to Mr. Jefferson."], [299, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 277 But he soon found that, like the scriptural foolish man, he had built his house upon the sand, and the rain de scended and the floods came and the Avinds blew, and it fell. Within the short period that he remained in the Government, some of the measures that he had brought into existence AA'ere already discredited by an offended pub lic sentiment, and toward the close of Mr. Adams' admin istration \u2014 one still guided by his superintending genius \u2014 the political fabric Avhich he had created was, by the same power, blown into atoms. It Avas this great overthroAV that brought home to him the umvelcome conviction that other constitutional foundations than those Avhich the Fed eral Convention, the people, and the States had laid, no man, without the same aid, could lay. It presented to his mind, under circumstances the most impressive, a truth which he had overlooked in the eagerness of his pursuit after poAver, viz., that the people were enabled by the popular provisions of the Constitution in respect to the executive and legislative departments, to break down the greater part of such structures as those which he had reared, by dismissing from their places those Avho had assisted in their construction, and substituting others, who, knowing their wishes, would feel it their interest to respect them ; and what was passing before his eyes afforded the most reliable evidence that they would not be slow in the exercise of the rights that belonged to them. This was the handwriting on the wall that foretold the fate of all his plans, and called forth, during the brief period of his subsequent existence, his continued denunciation of the Constitution as \" a frail and worthless fabric.\" It AAras at the moment of this great disaster, when dis may prevailed in the Federal councils, whilst Hamilton was broodinff over a defective Constitution which he knew the States would not alter to suit his Avishes and which it was"], [300, "278 POLITICAL PARTIES evident the people Avould not permit him to pervert, that the Federal party was conducted to the judicial depart ment of the Government, as to an ark of future safety which the Constitution placed beyond the reach of public opinion. The man who planned this retreat was John Marshall \u2014 a statesman of great power, one Avho partook largely of Hamilton's genius, Avas better acquainted Avith the character of the people, and possessed more control over his own actions. \u2022 The period Avhen this once powerful party was thus counseled and guided was one Avell calculated to cause its members to embrace the advice given to them Avith avidity. They had just been expelled, root and branch, from those departments of the government Avhich the Constitution had made accessible to public opinion and subject to the voice of the people ; whilst over that to which they were recom mended to extend their preference and favor, the people possessed but little if any control. This difference, so acceptable to their most cherished feelings, Avas besides greatly increased in value by the grossly irrational ap prehensions under which they labored in regard to the course of the President elect and to the dispositions of the party by which he had been elevated to poAver. That he participated largely in the feelings and views of the Jaco bins of France, and Avas prepared for the introduction of their opinions and practices in this country ; that re ligion, the rights of persons and property, and all the interests which are regarded as sacred under well regu lated governments, Avere put in jeopardy by his election, were opinions to which there were but feAv dissentients in the Federal ranks. I have elsewhere referred to a letter, written during the then recent canvass by Hamilton to Washington, in which he avowed in the most solemn and deliberate manner his conviction that the Republican party"], [301, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 279 desired to make our Government subservient to the policy of that of France, and Avould, in all probability, rally under her banner if it was unfurled in force on our shores. Similar sentiments Avere fulminated from pulpit and press; and there are yet, here and there, living witnesses, who will not partake of the surprise this description of the then condition of the public mind is calculated to excite on the part of the present generation because they know it to be true, and yet remember how often and with what solemnity the warning Avas uttered from sacred desks that Jefferson's election would be the signal for the prostration of our pulpits, the burning of our Bibles, and the substitution of some Goddess of Reason. The promises of the mild SAvay of reason aud justice, installed and enforced by that great statesman, Avith no other limitation than the removal from office of factious incumbents Avhose violence was calculated to obstruct the successful action of the principles he AA'as elected to sustain, and the revocation of judicial trusts created in the last moments of a power already condemned by the people, and Avhich Avere designed to counteract their will \u2014 a SAvay Avhich bore upon its wings the repeal of odious taxes, the reduction of superfluous expense, the payment of the public debt, and the avoidance of all unnecessary public burdens, Avith a zealous concern for the rights of the States as well as for those of individu als, \u2014 made impressions upon the public mind in favor of the principles upon which it was founded, which now, after the lapse of more than half a century, are as fixed and as powerful as they were then ; but at the time were scouted by Federal leaders and presses as false pretences designed to deceive the people and to clear the way for destructive changes. Under such impressions the first object of solicitude on the part of the Federalists Avas to strengthen the existing"], [302, "280 POLITICAL PARTIES organization of the judiciary by increasing the number of its tribunals and those employed in its administration, and thus to place it before the country in a more imposing atti tude ; and the second to enlarge its powers beyond the bounds intended to be assigned to them by the Constitution. To accomplish the first object they resorted to a stretch of poAver which now, when the feelings it excited have long since died away and the actors concerned in it have with out exception descended to their tombs, will not, I feel con fident, find a justification in the breast of a single upright man, whatever disposition he may entertain to excuse it on account of the violence of public feeling prevalent at the time. After the fiat of the people had pronounced the absolute expulsion from office of the Federal executive Avithin a brief and fixed period, and virtually that of the Federal party from power, they availed themselves of the remnant of authority unavoidably left to them by the forms of the Constitution to establish new courts, embracing Avithin the jurisdiction assigned to them all the States of the Con federacy, and the district which had been set apart for the seat of the Federal Government; appointed three judges for each court, to hold their offices nominally during good behavior, virtually for life, Avith liberal salaries, \u2014 making in all twenty-one judges, besides clerks, etc., \u2014 al! designed to be placed beyond the power of the government that had been selected by the people to succeed them. Thus, much was done toward the accomplishment of their first object. The enlargement of the judicial poAver of the department Avas to be effected by a different process. Among the \"midnight appointments\" by President Adams, (a stigma attached to them at the time, and from which they have never been rescued,) Avere forty-two magistrates, nominated for the District of Columbia.

They Avere to hold their offices for a period extending beyond that for which the President himself was elected, and it was upon their cooperation Mr. Adams ami his cabinet intended that his successor should be mainly dependent for the discharge of the high duty im posed upon him by the Constitution \u2014 'that of causing the laAvs to be executed in the Federal District. The nomina tions Avere sent to the Senate on the second of March, confirmed during the night of the third, and Mr. Jefferson entered upon the duties of his office the next morning. The commissions Avere found on the table in the State De partment with its seal attached, signed by President Adams, and if signed also by a Secretary it must have been by a locum tenens, as Mr. Marshall had some days before been transferred from the office of Secretary of State to that of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The commissions had not been delivered, \u2014 an act Avhich Mr. Jefferson, as the head of the executive department of the Government, decided to be necessary to the completion of the appointment. Under such circumstances, and, doubt less, stung by the ungraciousness of the treatment he had received, he directed that the commissions should neither be recorded nor delivered, but treated as nullities.

The judges of the Supreme Court were to a man Federalists, and at the head of them stood, as chief justice, President Jefferson's persevering and consistent old political antag onist \u2014 John Marshall. The Chief Justice may not have been the severest student or the most learned lawyer, but he was certainly, all things considered, the ablest judge that had ever occupied a seat upon the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States. No man was ever more rigidly just or strictly impartial in all cases of meum and tuum that were brought before him for adjudication. Under a disposition the most genial, and a childlike simplicity and frankness of manner he cherished during his whole life, as all his race have done, Federal principles and Federal prejudices of the most ultra character. These, though ordinarily kept in due check by a commendable and exemplary self-command, \u2014 a virtue he shared with, if he had not in some degree imbibed it from, his friend and neighbor, General Washington, \u2014 had never theless been warmed by the circumstances of the moment to a high temperature. The inducements by which he was al most forced into public life by the General, shortly before the death of the latter, have been narrated in the account I have given of my conversation with his nephew, Judge Washington, at Mount Vernon.1 Unhappily impressed with the idea that his own as well as the interests of the country depended upon the support of Mr. Adams' admin istration, General Washington for once, and fortunately only for a brief season, lent himself to partisan movements and used his controlling influence to induce Mr. Marshall to offer for Congress, and in no other case has the high estimate he formed of a man's capacity been more signally verified by 1 See Note on p. 9."], [305, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 283 the result.

He Avas then transferred by Mr. Adams to the place of Chief Justice. Other cir cumstances lent their influence to infuse ill-will into the personal relations of Jefferson and Marshall. They were natives of the same State, and although they had stood as Whigs side by side in the Revolution, the political prin ciples maintained by Mr. Jefferson, after the establishment of our Independence, were so much more in harmony Avith those of Virginia as to place Marshall's views ever after under the ban of her opinion, notwithstanding the qualified sanction they received from General Washington. On the part of Mr. Jefferson, the unfriendly feelings which he believed Avere entertained toward him by the Chief Justice AA'ere, for him, quite earnestly reciprocated. This is shown by the following pointed extract from his letter to myself, in which, speaking of the alterations and other uses that had been made of his letter to Mazzei, he adds, \" and even Judge Marshall makes history descend from its dignity and the ermine from its sanctity to exag gerate, to record, and to sanction this forgery.\"1 Mr. Jefferson, apprised that steps Avere being taken to bring his acts in respect to the commissions under the supervision of the Supreme Court, at once penetrated the design that lay behind the particular measure, and, with that moral courage that never deserted him, prepared to defend the department committed to his charge. The 1 See Appendix."], [306, "284 POLITICAL PARTIES head of the State Department was advised, and the clerks instructed, to make themselves parties to no act which Avould justly be regarded as recognizing the authority of the court to meddle in the affair, and his views were, of course, faithfully carried out by Mr. Madison, as Avell as by the subordinates in the department. A motion was made at the December term of the court in 1801, for a rule requiring James Madison to show cause Avhy a mandamus should not issue commanding him to deliver those commis sions to the nominees. Notice of motion was served upon Mr. Madison, but he declined to appear. He was asked by the relator Avhether the commissions AA-ere signed and sealed, but declined to respond to such inquiries, as did also the officers of the department. Application was also made to the Secretary of the Senate for a certificate that the nominations had been confirmed, which was also re fused. A resolution was offered in the Senate directing the Secretary of the Senate to give the certificate. It was laid upon the table and no further acted upon. Upon affi davits stating these facts, except the last, a rule Avas ob tained requiring the Secretary to show cause why the man damus should not be issued on a day certain, of which he took no notice. The court, notwithstanding, proceeded to an ex parse hearing. \" Taa-o clerks Avere summoned from the department as Avitnesses, avIio objected to be sworn be cause they Avere not bound to disclose any facts relating to the business or transactions of the office. The court ordered the witnesses to be sworn, and their testimony taken in writing; but informed them that, Avhen the ques tions Avere asked, they might state their objections to answering each particular question, if they had any. Mr. Lincoln, avIio had been Acting Secretary of State when the circumstances stated in the affidavits occurred, was called upon to give testimony. He objected to ansAvering. The"], [307, "IN* THE UNITED STATES. 285 questions were put in writing. The Court said there was nothing confidential required to be disclosed. If there had been, he Avas not obliged to answer that, nor was he obliged to state any thing which Avould criminate himself.\"1 The testimony that Avas given is not set forth in the re port of the case. The counsel for the relator argued the questions he pre sented for the consideration of the court in the following order, viz. : 1st. Whether the Supreme Court can award the writ of mandamus in any case. 2d. Whether it Avould lie to a Secretary of State in any case Avhatever. 3d. Whether in the present case the court may award a mandamus to James Madison, Secretary of State. The point involving the question of jurisdiction was, according to the invariable course of legal proceeding, the first in order of consideration, upon the plain and simple principle that if the court have no right to act definitively in the matter there is neither use nor propriety in consid ering even, and much less in making a decision upon, the merits of the case. That belongs to the tribunal that possesses jurisdiction. No point was clearer than the \\A'ant of jurisdiction on the part of the Supreme Court, and such it Avill be seen Avas the unanimous antl unhesitating opinion of the court itself. The Constitution divides the jurisdic tion conferred on that high tribunal into that which may be exercised as original, and that which shall only be appel late, and separates the two in terms which leave no room for misapprehension or mistake. The language of the Constitution is \u2014 \" In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in Avhich a State shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original 1 Taken from the report of the case."], [308, "286 POLITICAL PARTIES jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction \" both as to the 1.iav and fact, Avith such exceptions and under such regulations as Congress shall make. The motion before the court Avas clearly an original proceeding in a matter in which it confessedly had no original jurisdiction ; so the court was obliged to say, and so it ultimately said. A pretense Avas set up by the relator's counsel that the court might claim the desired authority under that part of the Judiciary Act providing necessary means to enforce its appellate jurisdiction, Avhich, after specifying the cases in which such jurisdiction may be exercised, and pointing out the way in which it may be carried into effect, adds to the authority to issue writs of prohibition to the district courts in certain cases \u2014 \"and writs of mandamus, in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law, to any courts appointed or persons holding office under the author ity of the United States \" Noav the plain intention of this clause of the sentence was to extend the right of issuing a mandamus, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, to any subordinate authorities upon Avhom Congress might confer judicial poAA'er, whether that power was given to a court, or to a single officer not constituting a court accord ing to the ordinary interpretation of that Avord. The commissioners subsequently appointed under the Fugitive Slave Act are officers of that description. To think other- Avise is to suppose that the men Avho framed the Judiciary Act of 1789 designed by the terms they employed to give to the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in cases in Avhich it Avas denied to it by the Constitution \u2014 a design too absurd and too disingenuous to have found even a mo mentary resting-place in the minds of those great men. The court so far countenanced this interpretation as to assume, for the sake of the argument, that the words \" or"], [309, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 287 persons holding office,\" might embrace the case before it. But it immediately proceeded to disprove the assumption by saying, \" It has been stated at the bar that the appellate jurisdiction may be exercised iu a variety of forms, and that if it be the will of the legislature that a mandamus should be issued for that purpose that will must be obeyed. This is true; yet the jurisdiction must be appellate not original\" \u2014 and the court goes on to show that this pro ceeding Avould in no sense be regarded as an exercise of appellate jurisdiction ; adding to that demonstrative refuta tion the declaration, that if the act Avould bear the inter pretation given to it by the counsel, it Avould be directly contrary to the Constitution and therefore void. That the court had not the slightest right to do Avhat it was asked to do, or to take original jurisdiction of the matter in any form, was a point upon which it expressed no doubt ; and if it had decided the questions in the order in which they were presented by the relator's counsel, the necessity of dismissing the motion before coming to the considera tion of the merits of the case Avould have been too impera tive to be overcome. Under these circumstances what Avas the course pursued by the Chief Justice, who gaA'e the opinion of the court, and who alone of its members appears, in the report, to have taken part in the case \\ He reversed the order in which the relator's counsel had presented their client's case and substituted the following: \u2014 1st. Has the applicant a right to the commission he demanded ? 2d. If he has a right and that right has been violated, do the laws of his country afford him a remedy ? 3d. If they do afford him a remedy, is it a mandamus from this court ? That the question of jurisdiction is always the first in"], [310, "288 POLITICAL PARTIES order is a proposition too plain and too AA'ell-established to be discussed. It is not only a rule in our judicial system and in that from which ours has been derived, but must of necessity be a feature in every enlightened system of juris prudence. This order was observed by the counsel for the relator, but was so changed in the opinion of the court as to make the consideration of the merits precede the question of jurisdiction \u2014 an arrangement for which no good reason could be given, and for which therefore none was attempted to be given. The motive lay on the face of the transac tion. It Avas the only way in which the court could avoid the necessity of saying that they had no jurisdiction over the subject before proceeding to discuss and decide upon its merits. It was to avoid, though in appearance only, this judicial deformity that the Chief Justice reA-ersed the order of the questions, and then in an opinion, which occupies some twenty-six pages in Cranch's Reports,1 he attempted to prove that the Avithholding of the commis sions Avas an act not warranted by law, but a violation of a vested legal right which the court pronounced it to be ; yet wound up with an admission that the court had no jurisdiction of the subject, and of course no right to act upon it. If this statement is not in all respects true, then I do injustice to the Chief Justice and his associates, and the inferences I draw from it are to be turned not only from them but against myself. But if the matter, as described by the Chief Justice himself, stood in every respect as I have here narrated, then I insist \u2014 and I cannot, I am very sure, deceive myself in believing that every ingenuous mind, whatever may be its political bias, will concur with me in the position \u2014 that the course pursued by the Chief Justice 1 See Cranch's Supreme Court Reports, Vol. I., p. 137."], [311, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 289 and sanctioned by his associates was exceptionable in the highest degree. With the Constitution before them, it was entirely clear at the first introduction of the matter that they had no original jurisdiction of the subject, and could not, under any state of facts, comply with the appli cation of the relator. The course should therefore have been, and doubtless under ordinary circumstances would have been, to direct the relator 's counsel to confine their argument to that preliminary point and at its close, with the want of jurisdiction as apparent to the court as it proved to be, to have discharged the rule. But if the court had for any reason thought it desirable to hear the whole case, the same course should have been pursued when it came to their decision, and the merits of the case should have been left unacted upon. No end could be answered by an unauthorized decision on the merits, other than to show to the inferior tribunals what the Supreme Court would do if the case was brought before it on appeal ; and that was the design attributed to the Chief Justice by Mr. Jefferson and severely reprobated. Such is not the way in which it is admissible for superior tribunals to treat such subjects ; but if it could in any case be deemed excusable, it could never be so on an ex parte hearing. For myself I cannot, with equal and great respect for the principal actors, help regarding the proceedings, from the granting of the rule to show cause to the final decision, as exhibiting a culpable want of courtesy \u2022 on the part of one of the three great departments of the Federal Government toward a coordinate member, at least equal in dignity and power, greatly aggravated by the polit ical relations in which the President and the Chief Justice stood toward each other, and by the temper of the times in which they occurred. I apply the remark to them individually, because Chief 19"], [312, "290 POLITICAL PARTIES Justice Marshall was the principal, and seemingly the sole actor, in the proceedings on the part of the court, and because the retention of the commissions \u2014 the grievance those proceedings Avere designed to redress \u2014 wan not merely an executive act, but one committed in pursuance of the specific direction of President Jefferson. This AA'as always avowed by the latter, and the guarded manner in which the replies of Mr. Madison are stated in the report of the case is, to my mind at least, sufficient proof that the President was throughout considered and treated by the Chief Justice as the actual offender in the matter. In respect to the soundness of the volunteer opinion of the court it Avould be superfluous, considering the fate that awaited it, to do more than to restate the question. This may certainly be done with more brevity and perhaps with equal distinctness. It will not be denied that President Jefferson had the same po\\ATer over the subject on the 4th March that Mr. Adams would have possessed if his term of office had not expired on the 3d. The President under our system, like the king in a monarchy, never dies. Let us then suppose that Mr. Adams, after he had signed the commis sion and caused the seal to be affixed to it, but before it had been recorded or delivered, had discovered that the ap pointee was a felon, or for any reason an obviously improper person to be made a conservator of the public peace, was he not authorized to withhold it] The appointment is made by the Constitution to consist of three acts \u2014 the nom ination, the approval by the Senate, and the commissioning.

The President is ap prised of the impropriety of the appointment, \u2014 an act which the Constitution had devolved on him alone, \u2014 the commis sion is yet in his possession, for the office of Secretary of State is, for all such purposes, his office, and the question Avould not have been changed if the seal had been affixed at the President's House ; can it be for a moment supposed that the Constitution intended that his power over the com mission ceased the moment he attached his signature, or the Secretary the public seal, and that after that he had no right to arrest further preceedings, hoAA'ever strong his reasons for so dohig? Can it be presumed that its framers intended to invest the President in the discharge of his responsible duty to \" commission all the officers of the United States\" with an authority so precise and technical? It is on all sides conceded that he is not bound to commis sion after the Senate has approved, but has still a right to Avithhold the commission at his pleasure ; and it would be strange, indeed, if it was not intended to give him the power also to arrest its being put on record and delivered after he had signed it, if he saw good cause to do so; But it is not now important to Aveigh accurately the reason ing of the Chief Justice, Avhich certainly partakes largely of the art and precision of special pleading ; as the case Avas abandoned then, and no similar case has arisen for more than half a century. That the claim of Mr. Marbury and his associates, with ample facilities for its prosecution in the inferior tribunals within their reach, (Judge Cranch, the reporter of the case of Marbury v. Madison, a full believer in the judicial as well as the political infallibility of the Chief Justice, being the Federal judge in the District) should have been given up, after the determination with Avhich it had been asserted, and the care and favor with which it had been considered and elaborated by the Chief"], [314, "292 POLITICAL PARTIES Justice, would at the first blush seem not a little unaccount able. The fact of abandonment, in the absence of other explanation, Avould justify the inference that it was the result of a subsequent conviction that the proceedings Avere erroneous. But changes of opinion or disposition under such circumstances seldom arise, and the solution of their subsequent course is, I think, to be found in other consid erations. The course pursued by the President afforded unmistakable evidence of his determination to resist at the threshold, and to the bitter end, the supervisory poAA'er of the judiciary over the other great departments of the Government, which was then for the first time sought to be introduced through the exparle proceedings in the case of Marbury v. Madison. With such a demonstration before them it became the Supreme Court and its supporters, before it committed itself more deeply in the attempt it had entered upon to control the action of the aroused democracy of the country represented in the executive and legislative departments of the Federal Government, to survey, with more care than had perhaps been hitherto used, the means of offense and defense Avith which the Constitution had invested each. The result of such a scrutiny could not have failed to satisfy sensible men that the President elect, the new Senate, and the neAv House of Representatives, \u2014 Avho in their respective positions had frustrated the effort of the late President to subject his successor to a dependence during his entire official term, for the performance of a highly important part of his official duties in the Federal District, upon a magistracy not of his own selection, and had thus far also defeated an attempt, springing from the same spirit and upon an enlarged scale, to saddle the country with an uncalled-for and enormous addition to the"], [315, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 293 existing judicial corps, clothed with extensive authority, and to all substantial purposes irresponsible to the people, \u2014 Avere also invested by the Constitution Avith ample poAver not only to defeat a new effort to carry into effect before the appropriate tribunal the hostile views indicated by the proceedings in the case of Marbury v. Madison, but to reduce the power and dignity of the Supreme Court itself to a standard far inferior to those it then possessed. The Federal Constitution declares, that \" all the appel late jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court shall in all cases be subject to such exceptions and under such regula tions as Congress shall make.\" Thus by the words of the Constitution the Avhole subject is placed under the revision of Congress and is made subject to its action. If any attempt had been made to set up anew the importance that had been constructively attached, in the case of Marbury V. Madison, to the Avords \" or persons holding office \" in the Judiciary Act, that body would instantly have relieved that act and its authors from the preposterous aspersions which had been cast upon them. But there was matter in the background of far greater moment. The original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was lim ited to cases affecting ambassadors and those in which a State was a party. This branch of its jurisdiction has, it is Avell known, occupied but little of the time of the court, and has been withal very unimportant either in its char acter or consequences. DepriA'ed of the influence and eclat it has derived from the exercise of its appellate juris diction, the court Avould have stood as a pageant in the federal system of but little account for good or evil. With the addition of that obtained from appeals and writs of error from the inferior tribunals of the United States, its position before the country Avould still have been one of little consideration."], [316, "294 POLITICAL PARTIES Both branches of the jurisdiction in these respects taken collectively, their results would not have been any thing like the poAver and influence and dignity which the Supreme Court of the United States derived from a single clause in the Judiciary Act of 17S9, extending its appellate jurisdic tion to the decisions of the State courts. The assemblage of cases for its application arrayed in that pregnant section, aided by the power derived from the construction given to the provision in the Federal Constitution prohibiting the passage of State laws violating the obligation of contracts, \u2014 a provision always understood to haA'e been introduced to prevent State obstructions to the collection of British debts, but now made to override the insolvent systems of the States, etc., \u2014 gave the Supreme Court the supervision and control of the most valuable and hithferto the most cherished portion of the legislation and jurisprudence of the State governments. To secure this control was an object always near to Hamilton's heart. He attempted it openly in the Convention by his proposition for a negative upon State laws, etc. But in the hands of the court the control of the Fetleral Government over State legislation Avas equally effective, less likely to become obnoxious, and infinitely more secure ; for if it had been placed, as he proposed, in the hands of the President, or of the President and Senate, or of Congress, it would still have been deposited in places accessible to the people, and at short and stated periods liable to be overruled by their will. But here it was in the only sanctuary in a republican government he deemed safe against popular inroads, and it Avas this provision in the Judiciary Act which, more than all other things combined, made that department \u2014 Avhich Montesquieu described as next to nothing in point of power, and upon the weakness of which Hamilton, before the passage of that act, des canted so freely \u2014 the most formidable and overshadowing*"], [317, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 295 branch of the government. The section bears the impress of his mind, and if not the Avork of his pen was beyond all doubt the result of his suggestions. Hamilton was not a member then, but Ave have seen that he made speeches in Congress through another, and I have not a doubt that, if the truth could now be known, it would appear that but few things were said or done on one side, in either branch of that body, of Avhich he did not make a part in some form. Is it not passing strange that not a Avord is to be found in the Constitution to authorize Congress to confer such a jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court X Can it be for a moment supposed that such a power, \u2014 one so nearly akin to the proposition to place a veto in the hands of the Federal Government upon State legislation, one so emi nently calculated to alarm the State-rights party, \u2014 would have beeu allowed, if it had been by anybody believed to be in the Constitution, to pass the State Conventions sub silentio ? What is said in the Constitution about the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is not only satisfied by referring it to the inferior courts which Congress were authorized to \" ordain and establish,\" but is, by the terms employed, fairly confined to them. The place in the Constitution Avhere the authority is given to establish inferior courts to exercise those parts of the judicial power of which no original jurisdiction was given to the Supreme Court, and which were to constitute the basis for the operation of that which was to be appellate onlv, would have been, one would suppose, the very place in Avhich the authority to extend that jurisdiction to the State courts would have been inserted if it Avas intended to be 'given. Again, the whole judicial power of the United States is by the Constitution vested in the Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Conyress may from time to time ordain and establish. That the words"], [318, "296 POLITICAL PARTIES used embrace, and seem intended to embrace, the ivhole power, is apparent from the face of the Constitution, and Avas, besides, demonstrated by Hamilton in the first num ber of his \" Pacificus.\" Madison said in the Virginia Convention, that it would be in the power of Congress to vest the inferior Federal jurisdiction in the State courts ; and Pendleton and Mason intimated an expec tation that this Avould be done ; whilst Grayson said that State judges formed the principal defense of the rights of the States, and that Congress should not take from them their \" only defensive armor ;\" and Patrick Henry, Avho in the days of his political orthodoxy could snuff' danger to State rights in almost every breeze, apprehended that \" by construction the Supreme Court Avould completely annihilate the State courts. \" Had Congress invested the inferior Federal jurisdiction in the State courts, and had they accepted the extension, the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to those courts in the cases enumerated Avould have been in all respects proper. But the Congress, a majority of whose members were Hamiltonian Federalists, Avere not, for reasons it is noAV unnecessary to consider, willing to admit the State courts to a participation in the administration of the judicial poAver reserved to the Federal Government, and proceeded at once to ordain and establish inferior courts of their OAvn. These consisting of district courts, circuit courts and the one Supreme Court named in the Constitution, completed the organization of the Federal judiciary. Their respective jurisdictions Avere Avisely separated and accurately defined. A small portion of that Avhich was original Avas, for Avell-understood reasons, vested in the Supreme Court. The residue was separated and distributed among the inferior tribunals, subject to an appellate jurisdiction and supervisory power in the Supreme Court over all their proceedings. The system"], [319, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 297 thus arranged was not only complete but harmonious in all its parts. The courts Avere clothed Avith the entire judicial power of the Government ; were only authorized to act upon one class of subjects \u2014 those Avhich appertained to the judicial power of the United States. The judges re ceived their appointments from the same source, and Avere responsible for their conduct to one head. Looking only to judicial objects this might well be regarded as the judi cial system designed by the framers of the Constitution. If ours had been a consolidated government these pro visions would have embraced the whole subject, and satisfied the Avants of the whole country. But in the actual state of things in that regard they Avere inadequate to the ac complishment of that end. Instead of one consolidated government ours was a confederacy of sovereign States, presided over by a Federal Government Avhich they had themselves created and clothed with such powers as they deemed necessary to its efficiency and usefulness, and as would be most likely to conduce to the freedom, prosperity, and happiness of all. With no other bond of union during the first years of the Revolutionary contest than common danger, and obliged to struggle Avith a defective Federal organization, these States succeeded in constructing for themselves republican constitutions, and in several instances, before the establish ment of our Independence, sustained the brunt of that strug gle and came out of it Avith institutions fully adequate to all the purposes of good government, including systems of jurisprudence and competent tribunals for their administra tion. The administrators of these institutions, driven to desperation by great public and private distress, \u2014 the direct results of the oppression of the mother country, \u2014 may in a few cases, and for a short period, have forgotten that inter ests liable to sequestration in Avar AA'ere inviolable in peace,"], [320, "298 POLITICAL PARTIES and failed to interpose with sufficient alacrity a judicial barrier against the attempts of some of the State legis latures to throw obstructions in the way of the collection of British debts. But those were limited and temporary aberrations, which Avould soon have yielded to proper treat ment on the part of the Federal Government. At the period of the passage of the Judiciary Act the judges Avho presided in most of the State courts might be compared Avithout discredit to those who filled the benches of the Federal courts, and this relative equality has ever since been Avel I maintained. Such has certainly been the case in the State of New York. The name of Chancellor Livingston, who was then at the head of our equity sys tem, would lose nothing from a comparison with Chief Justice Jay, when the latter was placed at the head of the Federal courts. Our equity and common-law courts have since been graced by Chancellor Lansing, Chief Jus tices Lewis and Kent, aud Judges Brockholst Livingston, Smith Thompson, Ambrose Spencer, Wm. W. Van Ness, and others, all men of great talents and acquirements. Nor have the courts of our sister States been wanting in this regard. The names of Theophilus Parsons of Massachu setts, Tappan Reeves of Connecticut, and Pendleton, Wythe and Roane of Virginia, with numerous others, might be added to the list. It Avould not be an easy matter to match these by selections from the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States, highly distinguished as its incum bents have been. The State courts had, for nearly fifteen years before the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1789, performed, as Avell in peace as in war, most of the duties which the neAv Con stitution devolved upon the Federal judiciary. The Fed eral Government Avas authorized, by the articles of Con federation, to establish inferior courts for the trial of"], [321, "299 IN THE UNITED STATES. piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and courts for the trial of Admiralty cases, yet these powers had been carried into effect through the State judiciaries. But all at once the State courts were deemed unworthy of trust. Whence this change? Had the State courts degenerated? No such thing ; they were constantly improving, the su- pineness of a few in respect to the interests of the mother country, blamable as it certainly was, to the contrary notwithstanding. No, the State courts had not become worse, but the implacable opponents of those whose judi- cial power they represented had become stronger ! The old Anti- Federal party, the inflexible and powerful cham- pion for the rights of the States, had been overthrown \u2014 forever demolished, at least in that array. The Slate gov- ernments were for a season helpless. Those who were always hostile to their power \u2014 who, in the language of Hamilton after the Convention, and in the act of foreshad- owing the effects of such an administration as actually succeeded, were desirous of a \" triumph altogether over the State governments, and to reduce them to an entire subordination\" \u2014 were all powerful in Congress. Nor was their power confined to Congress or to any particular branch of the Government. The result of the question of ratification in the different State Conventions, and the idea present to every mind that material prosperity, public aud private, would be much promoted by that result, produced a great change in public sentiment adverse to the authority and influence of the State governments. It was made fashionable to deride them. The organization of the Federal judiciary was the very first opportunity that was afforded after the adoption of the Constitution to make the States feel the power which their inveterate opponents had ac- quired by that event, and most unsparingly was that power exercised."], [322, "300 POLITICAL PARTIES The few members of that Congress who had not been entirely carried away by this current, and had the boldness to stand by the States and their tribunals \u2014 among Avhom that firm and incorruptible republican, James Jackson of Georgia, Avas by far the most effective \u2014 Avere willing- that a right to supervise and reverse the decisions of the State tribunals in all matters of Federal jurisdiction, should be conferred on the Supreme Court of the United States, provided only that the State courts were intrusted, as they had hitherto been, with the administration of the inferior Federal jurisdiction in lieu of the inferior Federal courts which the Bill proposed to establish. This they contended AA'ould make the system an harmonious and consistent one, and preserve the respect and consideration which was due to the State tribunals. The proposition was literally scouted in debate and re jected by a vote of two to one in the House, and in the Senate by a still larger majority. The Bill was so con structed as to clothe the Supreme Court and the inferior courts it established with all the judicial power allowed to the Federal Government by the Constitution, with unim portant reservations which did not diminish their authority and do not require to be noticed. Ample means were thus provided for its practical extension to every party entitled to its protection, and if those who regulated the action of Congress had not been influenced by any views other than such as related to the administration of justice, its legisla tion would have terminated there. But that body went further. A clause was added to the Judiciary Bill profess ing to give to the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over the final judgments and decrees of the highest courts of law and equity of a State, whoever might be the parties to the suit, or whatever might have been the objects for which it had been brought, provided only that the relative"], [323, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 301 poAA-ers of the Federal and State governments under the Federal Constitution in respect to several enumerated sub jects had in the course of prosecution of such suit been \"drawn in question,\" and decided against the Federal power. No matter to what extent the rights of the parties were concluded by that question, or in Avhat form or hoAV incidentally it had been introduced, it was sufficient that it had been raised and decided against the Federal, or in favor of the State authority, to subject the judgment or decree given by the State court to be reexamined or re versed in the Supreme Court of the United States. To confer upon that tribunal, the anomalous authority of issu ing Avrits of error to the highest courts of other States confessedly sovereign, and Avhich in all such matters might well be regarded as foreign States. \u2014 courts which were not established by the Federal Government, and between Avhich and it there existed no judicial relations, \u2014 command ing those courts to send to it for reexamination, reversal, or affirmance, the record of judgments and decrees which had neither been made under Federal authority nor by judges in any sense amenable to it for the discharge of their official duties, Avas an idea never broached in the Federal Convention, or in the slightest degree alluded to in the Constitution it adopted. Disputes in respect to the boundaries of power between the Federal and State governments Avere foreseen, and the means for acquisition and defense sought after by the special friends of each. Both looked to their respective legisla tures as the theatres of encroachment, and a very serious effort Avas made to obtain authority for the Federal Gov ernment to confer important State appointments, and to interpose a negative upon State laws. These concessions were sternly refused by the friends of the State authorities, and if they had been granted the new Constitution Avould"], [324, "302 POLITICAL PARTIES never have been ratified. No efforts have been made by Congress through direct legislation to restrain the State legislatures from encroaching on the power of the Federal Government, and it would not be an easy matter \u2014 the Con stitution being silent on the subject \u2014 to establish a right on the part of the judicial power to interfere in that direction Avhich would not also devolve on the Federal legislature, the power more particularly interested iu the matter. The clause referred to in the Federal Judiciary Act looks in an especial manner to the legislative acts of each govern ment, and seeks to establish the supremacy in the Federal system. It is possible that the framers of the Constitution intended to give Congress a right to confer such a power on the Supreme Court, but it is certainly most extraordi nary if that was so that the subject should have remained unnoticed in the Convention, and have been so entirely ex cluded from the face of the Constitution. Be that as it may, it is well known that the authority given to the court by the statute for a long time lay in its hands a dormant power. Those who conferred it had too much their own Avay in the administration of the Federal Gov ernment, during the first twelve years of its existence, to require extraneous aid to push its power to the extremes they desired. It was when they had been expelled from its executive and legislative departments by the uprising of the people that their attention was more earnestly turned to that of the judiciary as one which \u2014 as well from the peculiarity of its constitution as from the views of those who were in possession of it \u2014 Avas best qualified for the protection of rights which they, no doubt honestly, believed in danger. Hence the movement in the case of Marbury V. Madison. We cannot noAV form a complete estimate of the extent to Avhich the character of our institutions, in view of that"], [325, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 303 step and of measures of which it might have been the opening wedge, hinged upon the character and disposition of those whom the people had then just raised to power. The respect and reverence with which the minds of a vast majority of our citizens were impressed for their courts of justice, the confidence which had been reposed in their purity as indicated by the tenure of their offices, and the imposing character of those who filled them at the mo ment combined to deter feeble and irresolute minds from resistance to the authority of the Supreme Court of the United States, hoAA'ever unfavorable their estimation of the course upon which it was entering. No unauthorized exercise of power Avould, for any considerable period, have passed unchecked by a people like ours, then yet fresh from a national struggle for prin ciples better defined and defended with more steadiness and by purer means than any the world had ever witnessed in revolutionary contests. But the class of men, in any community where deference for the ermine is habitual, who will meet danger at the very threshold, and oppose resistance to judicial usurpation at the instant of its ap pearance, is not likely to be numerous. Hostile to every assumption of power over the conduct or mind of man not originally authorized by man himself, however plausible the pretences upon which it might be exerted, an opposition deeply seated in his nature, matured and confirmed by study and by all the observation and experience of his eventful career, Jefferson Avas not the man to submit to encroachments upon institutions he had sworn to protect, and more especially upon that branch of them which a great and free people had confided to his particular care. It was no matter to a man of his knowl edge of the world and approved moral courage from Avhat quarter such encroachments proceeded, they Avere certain to meet with a firm and spirited opposition on his part."], [326, "304 POLITICAL PARTIES The course pursued by the State department Avas by his express direction, and of course upon his responsibility. This he always avoAved, and this would have appeared in the report of the case of Marbury and Madison, if the fact had not been designedly and for obvious reasons suppressed. It Avas to accomplish this object that the statement of the case which accompanies the elaborate opinion of Chief Justice Marshall Avas made to present an appearance so ambiguous and unlawyer-like. Mr. Madison, it is stated, refused to deliver the commission. Ou Avhat grounds 1 That is not stated, only that his explanations Avere not satisfactory to the relator. If they had been given the fact referred to Avould have appeared on the face of the record, and Avould have gone down to posterity as au ansAver to the reasoning of the opinion. The refusal of the witnesses \u2014 clerks in the department \u2014 to be sworn or to answer, and the decision of the court that they should be sAvorn and answer under certain restrictions, and that they AA'ere sworn, are all stated with much particularity, but what they said is not stated. Here, again, the fact is suppressed that the commission was retained in the ex ecutive department by the orders of the President, Avho, in the exercise of executive discretion, regarded it as the evidence of an appointment not completed, and Avhich he decided not to complete. But this was only a foretaste of the spirit Avith which the scheme of the Federal party to raise the judicial depart ment of the Federal Government, not only over the States and their judicatories but over the tAvo other departments of the General Government, was to be met. Two months had not elapsed after the delivery of the opinion of the Chief Justice in Marbury v. Madison, before the entire judicial fabric Avhich that party had erected during the last moments of their expiring poAver, by which twenty-one"], [327, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 305 additional federal judges Avere appointed, eighteen in the States and three in the District of Columbia, Avith large salaries and still larger power, to hold their offices virtually for life, was overthroAvn by the vote of a majority of Congress, a majority more confiding, more harmonious, and better disposed to second and sustain the measures of the executive than any AA'e have ever had. This measure \u2014 the least important effect of which was to relieve the national treasury from the payment of salaries to some twenty-seven or thirty gentlemen, whose services an experience of more than half a century has shown to have been unnecessary \u2014 was assailed with unprecedented violence. Gouveneur Morris said it had stricken down the sanctity of the judiciary, and his political associates in Congress denounced it as a gross infraction * of the Constitution. He spoke of it with the same vehe- mence and heat with which he taunted the men who had passed it and their successors, twelve years afterwards, at the federal celebration of the restoration of the Bourbons, when he invited them, by the appellation of the \"savage and wild democracy,\" to see, \" though it should blast their eye-balls, royal princes surrounded by loyal subjects ! \" The attempts of Mr. Morris and his coadjutors to exas- perate the public mind against the repeal of the midnight Judiciary Act recoiled upon their party. The only effects they produced were to rivet the convictions of a large majority of the people that they had acted wisely in changing their rulers, and to evoke a determination to sustain the men in power as long as they adhered to the course upon which they had entered. To the Chief Justice, his associates on the bench, and the leaders of the defeated party, this condition of public opinion presented consid- erations of the gravest import. The court had decided, and their was sustained by the latter with perfect 20"], [328, "306 POLITICAL PARTIES unanimity, that the appointment of Marbury had been completed before Mr. Jefferson came into office, that the Secretary of State had therefore no right to Avithhold his commission, and that he could be compelled to deliver it by mandamus, provided only that the proceedings should originate in an inferior court. There AA'as no ground for question in respect to the legality of the appointments of the midnight judges, or their clerks, if the repealing laAv Avas unconstitutional, nor of their right to their salaries. This was certainly a question for the judiciary in respect to private rights ; and if the courts could compel the one Secretary by mandamus to deliver a commission wrong fully withheld, a fortiori could they compel another to pay salaries undeniably due if the repealing law was unconsti tutional. The field for the writ of mandamus Avas thus greatly enlarged. If the withholding of a few justices' commissions constituted good ground for the institution of such proceedings as those we have referred to, the case now presented Avas one of much greater magnitude, and no party was ever more deeply committed before the country on a public question than they Avere in regard to the unconstitutionality of the Repealing Act. If they Avere right in that, and also in their views in respect to the poAvers of the Supreme Court, a mandamus would of course have been authorized to compel the treasury to pay the judges their salaries. Should they resume the Marbury and Madison case in the inferior courts, and proceed in this also, or should they abandon both and submit themselves to the stigma of having been the authors of false pretences and unfounded clamor, was the question to be met. The Republican party of the Union, as then consti tuted, Avas for the first time in possession of tAvo depart ments of the Federal Government. Whilst in a minority they had not been regarded by their high-reaching op-"], [329, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 307 ponents with feelings of much respect. Whatever might still haA-e been the federal impressions of their principles or designs, there was no longer room* for two opinions, in respect to their determination, their firmness and their capacity to carry out the measures they deemed necessary to the public service. Such being the circumstances in Avhich they Avere placed, the Chief Justice, his associates and friends, surveyed the exposures and defences of the only department that was left under their control, and it was natural that they should ponder upon possible conse quences before they proceeded another step in a course which the other departments regarded as one of aggression. The supervision and control of the Supreme Court of the United States over the largest portion of the legislation and jurisprudence of the State governments, designed to be secured by the twenty-fifth section of the Federal Judiciary Act and the extent to which they might be carried, were, in their political aspects, looked upon by Hamilton and his folloAvers as constituting the only remaining sheet-anchor of the government, in the sense in which they desired to see it administered. This lay completely at the mercy of their opponents. No matter what might be their confi dence in the constitutionality of the provision, the Avhole appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is, by the ex press letter of the Constitution, to be exercised subject to \" such exceptions and such regulations as the Congress shall make.\" An act of three lines repealing the clause of the Judiciary Act Avould except Avrits of error to State courts from the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and another might abolish the use of the Avrit of manda mus. The members of that court had seen too much of the temper and firmness of the President and Congress to doubt the immediate adoption of such measures if the contest in regard to the boundaries of poAver between the"], [330, "308 POLITICAL PARTIES departments was continued, and Avere too sensible of the extent to which that high tribunal Avas indebted for its power and dignity to* that branch of their jurisdiction to push so unprofitable a collision one step farther under their present auspices. The consequence was a suspen sion of all movements in that direction. No more was heard of Mr. Marbury 's claims to his commission, and the neAv judges quietly submitted to expulsions from their life-estates in offices by a law they claimed to be un constitutional, with a court within their reach authorized to declare it such if it so believed. Chief Justice Marshall remained at the head of the Su preme Court many years after the delivery of his opinion in the case of Marbury and Madison. During that long period he not only acquired, by the exercise of his great talent, the high distinction of which I have already spoken, but endeared himself by his personal demeanor to all who Avere drawn Avithin the circle of his acquaintance. No generous mind could contemplate a man possessed of such toAvering intellect, placed in so elevated a position and bearing his honors Avith such modesty and unaffected simplicity as he habitually displayed, without being im pressed with a deep interest in his character. I Avas not among the least cordial of his admirers, and Avould not for the world speak a Avanton or unkind Avord in disparagement of his memory. But the public acts of public men are always and under all circumstances legitimate materials for history, and may be canvassed Avith freedom, provided they are spoken of truly, and revieA\\'ed \" with good mo tives and for justifiable ends.\" To this limitation it shall be my endeavor to confine myself on this as on all other occasions. No part of the fame which Chief Justice Marshall ac quired on the bench was due to his course and conduct in"], [331, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 309 the case of Marbury and Madison, which may with truth be regarded as his judicial debut. He had been snatched from the political caldron, heated to redness by human passions, almost at the moment of his first appearance on the bench. In his rapid transition from the halls of Con gress and the Departments of War and State to that of the Judiciary, he had, as it Avere, been driven to the bench as to a place of safety before a tempest of public indignation created by the abuses of the administration of which he had been a part. Among his first acts after reaching it, and before time had been allowed for his passions to cool, be fore he had acquired judicial habits or had leisure to think even of the amenities that should distinguish his new posi tion, was a severe blow at the wizard Avho, he believed, had raised the wind and directed the storm. But Jefferson, the \" dreaming Condorcet,\" as Hamilton sometimes called him, proved an accomplished statesman. Wide awake, he made ample preparations for the assault, interposed effect ual resistance, and the recoil and ultimate abandonment were the result. I have heretofore referred to the non observance in these proceedings of due respect toward the acts of a coordinate department of the Government, \u2014 an obligation on the part of each from Avhich no consideration can release them, and Avhich in this case Avas rendered still more imperative by the relations, personal and political, that had existed between the President and the Chief Justice. WhateA'er weaknesses I may be subject to, \u2014 and doubtless they are numerous, \u2014 dogmatism, I am very sure, is not one of them. My endeavor always is to state my positions with deference to the judgments of others.

In addition to the great and permanent importance it is to the Government and the country to keep doAvn this heresy, Ave haA'e in this case a scarcely less potent induce ment for giving the matter a very thorough consideration, founded in a desire to do justice to the conduct and char acter of that great and good man."], [334, "312 POLITICAL PARTIES The division of the powers of the Federal Government into distinct and independent departments is founded on a priuciple the value of which has never been lost sight of by the framers of governments designed to be free. It must at the same time be admitted that, among the prin ciples Avhich necessarily enter into such a system, there are not many so difficult to define Avith desirable certainty or to uphold in practice. The faithful and capable men who constructed ours, state as Avell as national, have been as successful, I believe, in this respect as any who have gone before them ; and the efforts which have been so per severingly made to counteract their patriotic designs must be attributed to an inherent spirit of encroachment Avhich is inseparable from poAver in Avhose hands soeA'er it may be placed. The veto message contained the folloAving passage : \u2014 \" If the opinion of the Supreme Court covered the Avhole ground of this act, it ought not to control the coordinate authorities of this Government. The Congress, the ex ecutive, and the court must each for itself be guided by its own opinion of the Constitution.

It is as much the duty of the House of Representatives, of the Senate and of the President, to decide upon the constitutionality of any bill or resolution which may be presented to them for passage or approval, as it is of the supreme judges when it may be brought be fore them for judicial decision. The opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges ; and on that point the President is independent of both. The authority of the Supreme Court must not, therefore, be permitted to con trol the Congress or the executive when acting in their"], [335, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 313 legislative capacities, but to have only such influence as the force of their reasoning may deserve.\" To present an intelligible vieAv of this matter, the grav- ity of which cannot fail to be appreciated as Ave proceed, it is necessary that Ave should in the first place ascertain and define the leading idea Avhich its author intended to convey by the Avords he employed. The entire paragraph is replete with distinct avowals of his meaning, but in the midst of them are to be found a few words by which its true sense is exposed to cavil and perversion. This was a point upon Avhich General Jackson was very liable to err, notwithstanding his natural and in other matters practiced Avariness, \u2014 a qualification with which few men Avere more amply endowed than himself. The spirit by Avhich alone free governments can be sustained Avas deeply planted in his breast by the hand of Nature ; quickened into life by the blows of the enemy, whilst a prisoner and yet a strip- ling, it grew Avith his growth and strengthened with his strength. But possessed of a mind that Avas ever dealing Avith the substance of things, he Avas not very careful in regard to the precise terms in which his principles were defined. He was, besides, at that moment placed in a peculiar as Avell as difficult situation. Whilst struggling with an institution which felt itself sufficiently powerful to measure strength with the Government, and which had been itself stunjr to madness by his refusal to submit to its arbitrary demands, he Avas deprived of the assistance of the leading members of his cabinet. The Secretary of the Treasury, to whose department the subject belonged, had, in his report to Congress, placed himself on record in favor of the bank, and the Secretaries of State and of War con curred in his opinion ; all three openly disapproved of, and could not cordially cooperate in, the measure the President was about to adopt \u2014 the Secretaries of the Treasury aud"], [336, "314 POLITICAL PARTIES of War, as will be seen by the letters of General Jackson to myself, which on account of the interesting matters to which they relate will be given with these memoirs,1 pressing their opposition so far as to make it sufficient ground for pro posing to retire from his cabinet \u2014 a step they Avere with difficulty prevented from carrying into immediate effect. That a document of such length, prepared on the spur of the occasion and under such untoward and exciting cir cumstances, should not have been even more vulnerable to the assaults of his astute and implacable opponents, is not a little surprising. Few had better opportunities for knowing the state of feeling Avhich prevailed at the Presidential mansion, Avhilst this matter was in progress, than myself. I arrived at New York from my brief mission to England after the Bank Bill had passed both Houses and on the day it was sent to President Jackson for his approval, and left the next morning for Washington. Arriving there at midnight, I proceeded at once to the White House, in pursuance of an invitation he had sent to New York in anticipation of my coming. I found the General in bed, supported by pilloAvs, in miserable health, but aAvake and awaiting and expect ing me. Before suffering me to take a seat, and whilst still holding my hand he, with characteristic eagerness Avhen in the execution of Aveighty concerns, spoke to me of the bank \u2014 of the bill that had been sent for his approval, and of the satisfaction he derived from my arrival at so critical a moment ; and I have not forgotten the gratification which beamed from his countenance when I expressed a hope that he Avould veto it, and when I declared my opinion that it Avas in that way only he could discharge the great x The correspondence, including other MSS. of the Author.

Not that he was ignorant of my views upon the subject, for in all our conversations in respect to it before I left the country, \u2014 and they had been frequent and anxious, \u2014 my voice had been decided as Avell against the then existing, as against any other national bank. Neither that he was himself in doubt as to the course that he ought to pursue, for he entertained none. But the satisfaction he evinced, and which he expressed in the most gratifying terms, arose solely from the relief he derived from finding himself so cordially sustained in a step he had determined to take but in respect to Avhich he had been severely harassed, by the stand taken by the leading members of his cabinet and by the remonstrances of many timid and not a few false friends, and had as yet been encouraged only by the few about him in comparatively subordinate positions who Avere alike faithful to principle and to himself. The veto message Avas prepared and sent in Avhilst I re mained at Washington. The manuscript Avas at all times open to my inspection, although I had but little direct agency in its construction. Had it been othenvise, the few words Avhich subsequently made that part in Avhich they appear so conspicuous could not have escaped my notice. The paragraph in the message which sets forth the con stitutional principles which President Jackson intended to avow, contains the following declarations : 1st. That if the opinion of the Supreme Court covered the whole ground of the act under consideration, still it ought not to control the coordinate authorities of the Government. 2d. That the Congress, the Executive, and the Court must each for itself be guided by its own opinions of the Constitution. 3d. That it is as much the duty of the House of Represent atives, of the Senate, and of the President, to decide upon any Bill or Resolution that may be presented to them for"], [338, "316 POLITICAL PARTIES passage or approval, as it is for the supreme judges Avhen brought before them for judicial decision. 4th. That the opinion of the judges has no more authority over Con gress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges, and that on that point the President is independent of both. 5th. That the authority of the Supreme Court should not therefore be permitted to control the Congress or the Ex ecutive, when 'acting in their legislative capacities, but to have only such influence as the force of their reasoning may deserve. In none of these avowals is the principle of irresponsibility in respect to the opinion of the Supreme Court, by fair construction much less by necessary implica tion, carried farther than to include the President when discharging his official duties as the depository of the executive power of the Government in approving or dis approving of a Bill or Resolution sent to him by Congress for his executive action. That in all this he was perfectly right, it AA'ill be seen even Mr. Webster, latitudinarian as he was, did not venture to controvert. But in the midst of these declarations are found thes\"e unguarded words: \"Each public officer avIio takes an oath to support the Constitution, SAvears that he will support it as he understands it and not as it is understood by others.\" Either this declaration Avas applied by the President only to all such officers as those of Avhom he had been speak ing before and of whom alone he spoke afterwards, all in the same paragraph, \u2014 to that class of officers who, singly as Avas his own case, or in conjunction Avith others as was the case with some, constituted the three great departments of the Government, whilst acting in their respective official capacities, as it was beyond all doubt intended to be applied ; or he must be supposed to have held that the inferior judges of the federal courts had a right to say to the superior court, \" We do not understand"], [339, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 317 the Constitution as you have expounded it, and we will therefore not submit to your decision ; \" the same as to the judges of the State courts of every grade, and as to the officers of the custom-house and innumerable other officers of his OAvn appointment ; empowering the latter on the same ground to refuse to conform to the instructions sent to them, &c, &c. A construction, one would think, too preposterous for credulity itself to swallow. \u2022 The plain and well-understood substance of what he said Avas that in giving or Avithholding his assent to the bill for the re-charter of the bank it AA'as his right and duty to decide the question of its constitutionality for himself, un influenced by any opinion or judgment Avhich the Supreme Court had pronounced upon that point, farther than his judgment Avas satisfied by the reason Avhich it had given for its decision. This covered the whole ground. It ex plained fully his views' of the Constitution in respect to what he Avas doing. All beyond Avas both uncalled for and unnecessary. To this vieAV of the President's power and duty under the Constitution Mr. Webster assented in the fullest manner. He said, \u2014 \" It is true that each branch of the legislature has an undoubted right, in the exercise of its fuuctions, to consider the constitutionality of a law proposed to be passed. This is naturally a part of its duty, and neither branch can be compelled to pass any law, or do any other act, which it deems to be beyond the reach of its constitutional poAA'er. The President has the same right Avhen a bill is presented for his approval ; for he is doubtless bound to consider, in all cases, Avhether such bill be compatible with the Constitution, and whether he can approve it consistently with his oath of office.\" If the supporters of the bank had been willing- to judge the President by the claim of power under the Constitution which he intended to advance in his veto message, there"], [340, "318 POLITICAL PARTIES would have been a perfect accord of opinion between him and their great leader in the debate upon that document, and one disturbing element would have been Avithdrawn from the severe agitation to which the public mind Avas ex posed. But this course neither suited the interest of the bank, nor AA'ould it have comported with the excited feel ings of the implacable enemies of the President. Matters had Avorked to their liking. By forcing the bill through the two Houses at the eve of the struggle for the Presi dent's reelection, and thus compelling him either to sign or to encounter the responsibility of defeating it, they felt that they had involved the great opponent cf the bank, \u2014 the only man Avhose power with the people they really dreaded \u2014 in toils from which his escape AA-ould be im possible. They were engaged in framing an issue Avith President Jackson and the Democratic party, looking at that time only to the defeat of his reelection but which was in 1834 so extended as to involve consequences second only in their importance to those of our struggle for indepen dence from the mother country, \u2014 an issue, which AA'as to decide whether the control by the people in affairs of gov ernment, the fruit of that great contest, should be con tinued, or be made to give place to a government controled by the money power of the country, the trial of Avhich continued much longer than that of the Revolution, and the ultimate results of Avhich were the extinguishment of the bank and the first direct overthrow of the Demo cratic party since its accession to poAver in 1800. Able to count their votes in both Houses, and certain of a majority in each, the leading friends of the bank reserved their greatest efforts for the discussion of the veto, the inter position of Avhich they understood the man they had to. contend Avith too Avell to doubt. Mr. Webster was designated by the supporters of the"], [341, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 319 bank to open the discussion, and a more competent man, or one better suited for the purpose, could not have been se lected. Among our public men there have doubtless been several whose mental endoAvments \\A'ere in some particulars superior to his. Hamilton possessed more genius and elo quence. Between Clay and Webster the same disparity existed, though not in the same degree.

Those Avho have the curiosity to turn to the record of his vigorous effort on that occasion Avill see a favorable specimen of the art in which he was so great a master. His opening speech Avas designed to give the cue to his party, its orators and presses, in respect to the grounds upon which the election was to be contested.

The strength of this public sentiment has carried the bill through Congress, against o o * ;*? all the influence of the administration, and all the power of organized party. But the President has undertaken, on his OAvn responsibility, to arrest the measure, by refusing his assent to the bill. He is answerable for the consequences, therefore, Avhich necessarily follow the change which the expiration of the bank charter may produce ; and if these consequences shall prove disastrous, they can fairly be ascribed to his policy only, and to the policy of his admin istration.\" These alarming consequences were portrayed as the un avoidable result of a failure on the part of the people to effect a change in our public councils, before the expiration of the charter of the bank, which could only be done at the then next election. No old school Federalist, who had grown to man's es tate Avith views and opinions in regard to the character of the people Avhich that faith seldom failed to inspire, could doubt the efficacy of such an exposition in turning the minds of all classes of the community in the desired direc tion. The idea of producing the catastrophe, thus held up to public view, through the direct action of the bank \u2014 a proceeding justly stigmatized as \" flagitious,\" in his recent letter to the NeAv York bankers, by Mr. Appleton of Boston, a distinguished and highly trusted Whig, avIio Avas in those days admitted behind the curtain and had a view of the Avhole ground, \u2014 had not at that time, I am satisfied, entered into the mind of Mr. Biddle, or perhaps into that of the most reckless advocate of the bank.

He Avas also well aware that among the ad mirers and sincere friends of General Jackson, there were in every State not a feAV Avho, confiding fully in his integ rity, believing him engaged in continual struggles for the public good with a reckless opposition and sincerely Avish ing him success, yet distrusted his prudence, listened readily to the reports of his enemies prejudicial to his character, and Avere kept in constant apprehension that he Avould, through passion or ill advisement, commit some rash act. Virginia abounded in that class of politicians. My quondam friend Ritchie scarcely ever went to bed in those exciting times without apprehension that he would Avake up to hear of some coup d'etat by the General, Avhich he Avould be called on to explain or defend, and his letters to me Avere filled with remonstrances and cautions upon the subject. A A'acancy occurring in the office of Attorney-General of the United States, I recommended the appointment of Mr. Daniel, now one of the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, for the place. He came to Washington, was pleased with the invitation to take a seat in the Cabinet, which the General authorized me to give him, Avas pleased also Avith the office and would have been glad to accept it under other circumstances, but was, notwithstanding, induced to decline it, after a day's consultation Avith me, by considerations of that character exclusively. The General was not a little amused, after our friend left us, to hear me attribute his refusal to an apprehension that he might, in"], [345, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 323 the discharge of his official duties be reduced to the neces sity of acting against the principles of '98, or against his, the General's Avishes \u2014 au alternative that he pre ferred not to encounter. I am free to confess that be fore I came to understand General Jackson as Avell as I subsequently did I had not a little of the same feeling. I had seen enough of him in the Senate, whilst occupying different sides in mere party politics, to satisfy me that he was incapable of acting knowingly against the public interest, but it Avas some time before I became thoroughly satisfied that I did not do full justice to his prudence. I will allude to a single occurrence bearing upon this point. His successful effort to remove the Indians to their West ern home is well known and ought never to be forgotten, for there has scarcely been a single act of his life which has proved more beneficial to all parties than that. When the act conferring upon him the necessary poAvers Avas be fore Congress, Avhich AA'as at an early period of his admin istration, it was found difficult to prevail on the Pennsyl nian members of the House to support it. They Avere be lieved to be influenced by an apprehension that by support ing it they Avould give offense to the Quakers who, as is knoAvn,are very numerous in their State. He invited them to an interview Avhich he asked me to attend. He remon strated with those Avho came in an earnest and really eloquent manner; placed before them very forcibly the importance of the movement as Avell to the Indians as to the country ; refuted the reasons which Avere given for their doubts, and as they rose to leave him, under indications not favorable to his Avishes, he told them, with much emphasis, that he could not believe that the reasons they had assigned were the true motives by Avhich they were actuated ; that they were men of too much sense not to see that the measure was a proper one, but that they were afraid of their popur"], [346, "324 POLITICAL PARTIES larity ; that they stood more in dread of displeasing the Quakers than they did of doing Avrong; conjured them to rise superior to such motives, and to do what was right, regardless of personal consequences ; told them they would find that to be the best way to make themselves popular, and concluded by saying that he should do his duty in this respect, and if the bill failed for the Avant of their vote it would not be his fault if their constituents were not supplied with means for forming a correct judg ment between them and him. This was the substance of what Avas said, and said with considerable animation. I observed his eye directed toward me whilst he was speak ing-, and the moment the door closed on the retiring- delega tion he turned to me with a smile upon his countenance and said Avith the blandest manner, \" I saAV that my re marks disturbed you.\" I admitted the fact, and said that although they Avere his friends, personal as Avell as political, I Avas apprehensiA'e that his observations, if they Avere made public, however true and just, might in the then feverish state of the public mind give countenance to the represen tations of his enemies. His reply AA'as : \"No, my friend, I have great respect for your judgment, but you do not understand these gentlemen as Avell as I do. They are quite honest, and wish to do what is right, but are pre vented from doing it by precisely the considerations to which I alluded. They will not be offended, because they know I am their friend, and act only for the public good, and you Avill see that they will shoAv a different dis position upon the subject\" \u2014 and they did so. My appre hensions Avere more on account of Avhat I feared he mirrht say, from the excited manner in which he spoke, than on account of what he did actually say ; and this was but one of numerous instances in which I observed a similar con tradiction between his apparent undue excitement and his"], [347, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 325 real coolness and self-possession in Avhich, I may say Avith truth, he Avas seldom if ever wanting. It was to the class of Jackson's supporters which I have described, men of Mr. Daniel's school, that Webster made his most powerful appeal ; to alarm and influence them his poAvers Avere ex erted to their utmost point. To do this with any chance of success a perversion of the Veto Message Avas indispen sable. We hav\u00a3 seen that he Avas obliged to admit that the President had a right, under the Constitution, to do all that he proposed by the veto. He had sworn to protect the Constitution as the chief executive officer of the gov ernment ; and Avhen an act Avas offered for his approval Avhich he honestly believed Avas contrary to that instrument, he had the right \u2014 not the power only but the right also \u2014 to withhold his assent. This Mr. Webster admitted in so many AA-ords, and President Jackson did not by the message propose to do any thing more. And yet Webster denounced him as a ruthless tyrant, Avho was violating the Constitution, and uprooting the foundations of society. Look at some of his fierce denunciations : \" He asserts a right of individual judgment on constitutional questions, which is totally inconsistent Avith any proper administra tion of the Government, or any regular execution of the laws. Social disorder, entire uncertainty in regard to in dividual rights and individual duties, the cessation of legal authority, confusion, the dissolution of free government, \u2014 all these are inevitable consequences of the principles adopted by the message, Avhenever they shall be carried to their full extent That Avhich is now claimed for the President is, in truth, nothing less, and nothing else than the old dispensing power asserted by the Kings of England in the Avorst of times \u2014 the very climax, indeed, of all the preposterous pretensions of the Tudor and the Stuart races."], [348, "326 POLITICAL PARTIES \"According to the doctrines put forth by the President, although Congress may have passed a law, and although the Supreme Court may have pronounced it constitutional, yet it is, nevertheless, no law at all, if he iu his good pleasure, sees fit to deny its effect; in other words, to re peal and annul it. Sir, no President, and no public man, ever before advanced such doctrines in the face of the nation.

If he gave the whole his readers Avould have seen that General Jackson could not have used the Avords in the sense attributed to them by Mr. Webster. In this dilemma he contented himself with substituting bold and reckless assumption for proof.

His language is ' each public officer, who takes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he Avill support it as he understands it and not as it is understood by others.' ' The opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges ; aud on that point the President is independent of both.' Now, Mr. President, I conceiA'e, with great deference, that the President has mistaken the purport of the oath to support the Constitution of the United States. No one SAvears to support it as he under- stands it, but to support it simply as it is in truth. All men are bound to obey the laws, of which the Constitution is the supreme ; but must they obey them as they are, or as they understand them ?

There Avas not only nothing in the message to justify such a charge, but its whole character was directly opposite, and that too plainly to be controverted.

Nor had Mr. Webster or Mr. Clay a moment's doubt that it was his intention to do so. Their violent not to say savage tirades against the veteran had a different object \u2014 and that Avas the election. There, fortu nately, they Avere unsuccessful, or Ave might yet have been in our Federal relations, as we unhappily are in those of the States, a bank-ridden people. But I cannot allow this great constitutional question, respecting the relation which the three great departments of the Federal Government \u2014 executive, legislative, and judicial \u2014 Avere by the Constitution designed to occupy toward each other, to pass without farther notice. One more vitally important has not arisen nor can ever arise out of our complex and peculiar form of government, and it is also one which there is reason to apprehend has not been studied with adequate care, by many avIio are in other respects sufficiently astute in detecting constitutional en croachments. General Jackson \u2014 though OAving to his military em ployment he had not been for many years of his life much engaged in party politics \u2014 was yet, from a very early period, strongly imbued with the principles of the fathers of the republican school in regard to the objects and only legi timate purposes of Government and the true construction of the Federal Constitution. His views in these respects were sufficiently disclosed in the course of his brief services in both Houses of Congress, during the administration of Washington, and more particularly in his celebrated letter to Williamson about the year 1800. Judge White, then his personal and political friend,"], [351, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 329 followed Mr. Webster in the debate on the Veto Message and in the course of his speech laid down, in a perspicuous and satisfactory manner, the principles applicable to the ques tion of the relative powers aud duties of the several depart ments of the General Government which President Jackson then, as he had at all times, sustained. Deeply incensed at the gross perversions of his message, on the part of the advocates of the bank, but at all times and under all circumstances against parleying with his enemies in the midst of a battle, the President contented himself with fre quent and unreserved expression of concurrence in the views which had been taken of the subject, on the floor of the Senate, by Judge White, and although reflected under the clamor which had been raised against him upon that point, and more determined than ever to prevent, by all constitutional means, the extension of the charter of the existing bank, he Avas equally decided, as he had always been, not to interpose, nor did he interpose, any obstruc tions to the employment by it of all the means provided by the charter to conduct business to its end and to wind up its affairs after its termination. Senator White's definition of the Constitution Avas ex pressed in the folloAving Avoids : \" The honorable Senator argues that the Constitution has constituted the Supreme Court a tribunal to decide great constitutional questions, such as this ; and that Avhen they have done so, the question is put at rest, and eA'ery other department of the govern ment must acquiesce. This doctrine I deny. The Con stitution vests 'the judicial power in a Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.'

But as an authority it does not bind either the Congress or the President of the United States. If either of these co ordinate departments is afterwards called upon to perform an official act, and conscientiously believes the performance of that act will be a violation of the Constitution, they are not bound to perform it, but, on the contrary, are as much at liberty to decline acting as if no such decision had been made If different interpretations are put upon the Constitution by the different departments, the people is the tribunal to settle the dispute. Each of the departments is the agent of the people, doing their business according to the powers conferred ; and Avhere there is a disagreement as to the extent of these powers, the people themselves, through the ballot-boxes, must settle it.\" This is the true view of the Constitution. It is that which was taken by those who framed and adopted it, and by the founders of the Democratic party. It is one Avhich Avas universally acquiesced in at the formation of the Gov ernment, and for some time thereafter. It is a matter of great moment, and one Avhich cannot be too closely scru tinized, especially at the present moment Avhen there is abundant reason to apprehend that heresies of a marked character in respect to it are being infused into the public mind. The principle which inculcates the necessity of dis tributing the powers of government among several depart ments, and that they should be independent of each other in the performance of the duties assigned to them by the Constitution, has united in its favor the opinions of the friends of liberty everyAvhere from a very early period to the present time. Montesquieu said : \" There can be no liberty Avhere the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body of magistrates ; \" or \"if the power of judging be not separated from the legis-"], [353, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 331 lative and executive powers.\" The American Revolution provided the fairest opportunity to test the merits of this doctrine that the world had ever seen, anil it was not lost sight of by the statesmen of that day. Many of the States recorded their adherence to it on the face of their constitu tions, some of Avhich Avere framed and adopted flagrante hello, and all paid due respect to it in the construction of their organic laws. The settlement and ratification of the Federal Constitution carried the discussion of its merit to our national councils Avhere, and more particularly in the discussion upon the question of ratification, the matter Avas Very closely examined and by very able hands. The oppo nents of the Constitution resisted it earnestly and with ability, on the ground, amongst others, that it did not pro vide sufficient guarantees to protect the departments from reciprocal encroachments, and to secure the required inde pendence of each. The difficulties, inherent in the very nature of government, of carrying those securities to an ex tent Avhich would silence cavil in respect to them, obtained for this objection advantages Avhich, in view of the well understood reverence of the people for the main principle, caused no small degree of inquietude to those able defenders of the Constitution \u2014 Madison, Hamilton, and Jay. The numbers of the \" Federalist \" which touch upon this point are full of interest and will Avell repay re-perusal. They afford the strongest evidence of an earnest adherence, on the part of those great men, to the general principle, and will, if I do not deceive myself, be found quite inconsistent with several positions Avhich have since been taken upon the sub ject. In the 47th number of the \" Federalist,\" Mr. Mad ison thus expresses his own views, and of course those of his associates, Hamilton and Jay, as they acted in concert: \" One of the principal objections inculcated by the more respectable adversaries to the Constitution, is its supposed"], [354, "332 POLITICAL PARTIES violation of the political maxim that the legislative, execu tive and judiciary departments ought to be separate and distinct. In the structure of the Federal Government no regard, it is said, seems to have been paid to this essential precaution in favor of liberty. The several departments of power are distributed and blended in such a manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form, and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the disproportionate Aveight of other parts. \"No political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic A'alue, or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty, than that on which the objection is founded. The accumulation of all powers, legislative, ex ecutive, and judiciary in the same hands, Avhether of one, a few, or many, and Avhether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. Were the Federal Constitution, therefore, really chargeable with this accumulation of power, or Avith a mixture of powers having a dangerous tendency to such an accumulation, no further arguments Avould be necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the system \" .... In No. 4S, speaking of the three great departments, he says: \" It is equally evident that neither of them ought to possess, directly or indirectly, an overruling influence over the others in the administration of their respective powers.\" .... In No. 49, he notices a proposition of Mr. Jefferson to authorize a Convention upon a call of two of the three departments, for \" altering the Constitution or correcting breaches of it,\" and says, \u2014 \" The several departments being perfectly coordi nate by the terms of their' common commission, neither of them, it is evident, can pretend to an exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries betAveen their respective powers.\" He then goes on to urge objections to too fre-"], [355, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 333 quent appeals to the people in that form, and sustains the opinion that it Avould be better to rely on other safeguards against encroachments which he details. In Nos. 78 and 81, General Hamilton, admitting that \"there is no liberty where the power of judging be not separated from the leg islative and executive poAvers,\" shows at great length the comparative Aveakness of the judicial power, and the very slight probability that \" the general liberty of the people can ever be endangered from that quarter.\" The provisions of the Constitution will be searched in vain for any Avhich indicate a design on the part of its framers to give to one of the departments power to control the action of another iu respect to its departmental duties under that instrument. All legislative power granted by the Constitution Avas vested in a Congress, to be composed of two Houses. The executive power of the Government was vested in a President. Specific powers to be exercised in conjunction with the Senate, as well as some in respect to which a question might arise Avhether they would otherwise have passed to the executive, were added, but the Constitu tion in respect to the legislative power, contained no limita tions or restrictions. All executive authority to be exercised under it was granted to the President, and he Avas hence spoken of by the writers of the \" Federalist \" as the sole de positary of executive power. By the third article of the Constitution the same expression is used in respect to the Supreme Court, &c. : \" The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court and certain inferior tiibunals.\" But as these terms would, standing by themselves, have conveyed all the judicial power of the United States to the Supreme Court, and as no such grant could be properly made because a large share of it had, in a previous part of the Constitution, been granted to a court of impeachment, of Avhich the Supreme Court only supplied the"], [356, "334 POLITICAL PARTIES presiding officer on a single occasion, \u2014 the trial of a Presi dent, \u2014 and Avas designed to be still farther restricted, the Constitution immediately proceeds to say, that \" The judicial power shall extend to all cases in laAv and equity arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority ; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls ; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdic tion, etc.\" No oath to support the Constitution is pre scribed by it, in regard to the incumbents of the legislative or judicial branches of the Government, other than the general provision that all officers of a certain description, (which included them,) Avhether belonging to the Federal or State governments, should swear to support the Federal Constitution. In regard to the executive department the case is very different. The Constitution requires from the President, and from him only, that he should, in addition to the oath of office, before he enter upon its duties, swear \" that he will, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Is it not surprising that under a Constitution so construct ed, exhibiting on its face such features, the idea should ever have been advanced that it AA'as to the judicial power of the Government that its framers looked for the preser vation of that sacred instrument? So far as it concerns the private rights of citizens and foreigners in questions of meam and luum, growing out of the laws and Constitution of the United States, or controversies regarding the separate and special interests of contending States, or of the United States, and in respect to the rights of foreign ministers and consuls, it Avas intended to be supreme and so made, nor has its supremacy in all these respects ever been questioned. But it seems very absurd to suppose that it was intended to"], [357, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 335 oblige the President of the United States, \u2014 the officer clothed with the whole executive power of the Government; the only officer, except the Vice-President, Avho is chosen by the whole people of the United States ; the champion, desig nated by the Constitution itself to \" preserve, protect, and defend \" it in the performance of the executive duties com mitted to his charge, \u2014 duties affecting Avhat Hamilton happily describes as \" the general liberty of the people,\" to distinguish it from affairs of meum and tuum, \u2014 to keep his eye upon the Supreme Court calendar, and to gather from its decisions in respect to the private rights of par ties litigant the measure of his constitutional powers, and to stop or go on in the execution of the important national offices assigned to his department as its judgments may be deemed to authorize or forbid his further proceeding. I can easily understand why a class of men, born AA-ith certain dispositions and trained to corresponding opinions, should desire such a construction of the Federal Constitu tion ; but in the face of facts and considerations like these, I can find no explanation of the boldness with AA-hich so groundless a pretension has been advanced, other than in the recklessness by Avhich the spirit of political en croachment is and will be characterized as long as it finds facilities for its gratification in the weakness or the pas sions of mankind. The deeper the subject is looked into, the more apparent to all bond fide searchers for truth will become the fallacy of the principle which claims for the Supreme Court a controlling power OA'er the other depart ments in respect to constitutional questions. Inquirers of this description cannot fail to appreciate the difficulty, nay the impossibility of reconciling Mr. Webster's unreserved admission of the President's \" undoubted right in the exer cise of his functions, Avhen a bill is presented for his ap proval, to consider in all cases Avhether such a bill be"], [358, "336 POLITICAL PARTIES compatible Avith the Constitution, and whether he can approve it, consistently with his oath of office,\" and to approve, or refuse to appro\\*e according to the result, with his severe denunciation of him for regarding an act as unconstitu tional, which had been approved by one of his predecessors, but which he, notwithstanding, conscientiously believed to be unconstitutional, and for withholding the power of the executive from the execution of any such act. Every body knows that an act which is contrary to the Constitu tion is a nullity, although it may have passed according to the forms of the Constitution. That instrument creates several departments, whose duty it may become to act upon such a bill, in the performance of their respective functions. The theory of the Constitution is that these departments are coordinate and independent of each other, and that when they act in their appropriate spheres they each have a right, and it is the duty of each to judge for themselves in respect to the authority and requirements of the Consti tution, without being controled or interfered with by their co-departments, and are each responsible to the people alone who made them for the manner in which they dis charge their respective duties in that regard. It is not therefore to be presumed that that instrument, after making it the President's especial duty to take an oath to preserve and uphold the Constitution and prevent its violation, intend ed to deny to him the right to withhold his assent from a measure which he might conscientiously believe Avould have that effect, and to impose upon him the necessity of outraging his conscience, by making himself a party to such a violation. The Constitution, Avhich Avas framed by great men, the form of Avhich has been so much and so justly admired, is not so imperfect nor subject to such a reproach. The matter does not necessarily end Avith a refusal on the part of the executive to do an act Avhich he believes con-"], [359, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 337 gress had no right, under the Constitution, to require his department to perform. Although the President, represent ing one of the three great departments of the Government, possesses in this respect a right which neither the citizen nor any other officer or officers of the Government, not having the control of such a department, can exercise, yet if he allows himself to be governed by unworthy motives he is liable to impeachment and expulsion from office. It is in this way, or by his removal by the people, that the wrong he does to the public is redressed. But this is not all. If the act has been passed according to the forms of the Constitution, and is judged to be constitutional by the judicial department of the Federal Government, it is obligatory upon the citizens, binds and controls their private rights and personal interests, and can be carried into effect in respect to those by the judiciary, which also judges for itself regarding the constitutionality of such law. It is the department by which laws, affecting as well the private rights of the citizen as those of the States, which can be made the subjects of litigation, are carried into effect. It has ample power conferred upon it to cause its judgments and decrees to be executed. Officers are ap pointed whose duty it is made by law to obey its orders, and these officers have the right given to call out the civil power of their respective districts to enable them to execute judicial decrees. Nor do the rights secured to it by the Constitution stop here. If resistance is offered to the ex ecution of a judgment or decree \u2014 made by the proper court to which jurisdiction of the matter which such judg ment or decree seeks to enforce is given by the Constitu tion \u2014 too great to be overcome by the civil power, it is the duty of the President, upon the request of the officers n of the court, to order out the military power to sustain that of the judiciary. It would be no answer on his part 22"], [360, "338 POLITICAL PARTIES to such a call to say that the right which the decree or judgment seeks to enforce arises under a laAv Avhich he deems unconstitutional. That is, under the circumstances, a matter that he has no right to inquire into. The decision of that question has been delegated to a different depart ment, and has by that department been decided differently. The Constitution requires that the judgments of that depart ment, upon subjects committed to it, should be enforced. It makes that enforcement, in extreme cases, the duty of the military. The President is intrusted Avith the command of that force and, in such a case, his power in regard to it is ministerial only. It is his duty, in such a case, to sustain the judicial poAver by the aid of the military, and if he failed in its performance he would subject himself to impeachment and removal from office. Not only is the entire power of the government thus pledged to the maintenance of judi cial authority, Avhilst acting in the line of its duties, but there lies no appeal from its judgments or decrees. They are final and obligatory upon the rights and interests of the parties. They can neither be reversed by any other tribunal, nor is it in the poAver of the remaining departments of the Government united to set them aside or to treat them as a nullity, however contrary to the Constitution they may be. We are not Avithout experience upon this point. Our history bears indelible record of the abuse of power in that form during the administration of the elder Adams. The unconstitutionality of the Sedition LaAv will now be scarcely controverted by any ingenuous mind. The Supreme Court, nevertheless, decided it to be constitutional, tried citizens for having violated its provisions, and caused fines and im prisonment to be inflicted upon them. When a majority of the Senate of the United States, friends of the bank, placed upou its journal an unconstitutional act of condem nation against President Jackson, for the steps he had taken"], [361, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 339 to relieve the country from that institution, the same body, after its political complexion had been sufficiently changed through the influence of an offended public sentiment, not only reversed the sentence but expunged it from the record. This it had a right to do, because both acts Avere committed by the same branch of the same department. But the exe cutive and legislative departments had no such power over the unconstitutional sentences that were pronounced under the Sedition Law, because they had no right to interfere Avith the acts of a coordinate department. The President had an express right to pardon such offenses, and the na tional legislature had a constitutional right to return the money collected from those who committed them, and they did so. But the judgments of the court remained, and will forever remain, unreversed. In England, judicial convic tions, attainders, judgments of forfeitures of franchises, etc., may be reversed by act of Parliament, but no such interfer ence by one department of the government Avith the au thorized proceedings of a coordinate department are per mitted by our Constitution, simply because the great depart ments of our Government are by the Constitution made co ordinate and independent of each other. Can any reflecting mind, in view of these facts, doubt the sufficiency of the protection which that instrument provides for the personal rights of the citizen and for private interests of every de scription, or for a moment apprehend the disorganization of society described by Mr. Webster as a consequence of carry ing into effect the principles avowed by President Jackson ? The judicial power of the Federal Government, accord ing to the description here giA'en of the binding force, the finality and efficiency of its decisions upon the parties and their rights in all cases Avhich may be brought before it, answers all the purposes of its institution. Was it the intention of the framers of the Constitution that it should"], [362, "340 POLITICAL PARTIES be clothed with other powers, and if so, Avhat are they ? The duties imposed on the executive and legislative de partments are of higher importance than those of the judi ciary, in proportion as the interests of the nation are of more consequence than the separate interests of individuals and minor associations. They include the question of peace or of Avar, and the maintenance of the latter, international obligations in the forms of treaties, their construction and execution, the regulation of foreign commerce and commerce among the States, the regulation of the currency, the estab lishment of a mint, the assessment and collection of the national revenue, the raising, regulating, and command of an army and navy, the establishment of a general and of particular post-offices, the regulation and protection of the Indian tribes, and many other duties which it is unne cessary to specify. In none of these is it contemplated by the Constitution that the judicial power shall take a part. The powers and duties of the other departments upon these subjects are to some extent specified in the Constitution, and the residue are left to the direction of the legislature which acts, in respect to them, through the Executive as the department especially charged with the execution of the laAvs. In the performance of their high duties these de partments are, at almost every step, met by constitutional questions. The Houses of the legislature, in every law or resolution that they pass, have to consider Avhether it is authorized by the Constitution to which they have sAvorn to conform, and the President and Senate, when they make a treaty, are bound to consider and decide the same ques tion. The President, as the sole depositary of the executive power, is under a similar obligation. His first inquiry is, whether the Constitution authorizes him to apply the poAver of his department to the execution of the business before him, or, if it is one of the numerous functions which the"], [363, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 341 legislature is in the constant habit of calling upon him to perform, has the legislature poAver under the Constitution to direct the thing to be done, and can he do it consistently with his oath to preserve and uphold that instrument? How are they to act in the decision of these questions ? By what considerations are they to be controlled? They know that they are responsible to the people, under whose commission they act, for all they do. The Constitution does not give to one department the right to decide such questions for another, either iu terms or by necessary im plication, nor subject them to any other responsibility, nor place before them any guide for the government of their de cisions other than their own discretion and their own con sciences, and has caused to be placed upon their consciences an oath that they will, in no event, act contrary to that instrument. Under such circumstances, I ask, Avhat are they to do ? What can they do, consistently Avith the duty they OAA'e to God, to their country, and to themselves, other than to decide such questions for themselves, following the dictates of their OAvn judgment ? Can it be believed that those Avho framed and adopted the Constitution intended to place these high functionaries, \u2014 the only representatives of the people, in the great departments of the government, over Avhose continuance in office the people possess con trol \u2014 to place them, in respect to their official acts, about which a constitutional question can be raised, under the guidance of a department over Avhich the people possess no such control, to be regulated by its decisions in private actions, to which such functionaries are not parties, and of which decisions they are, notwithstanding, to take notice at their peril. If a system so anti-republican could have been designed by those who made the Constitution, is it to be supposed that they Avould have omitted to declare, on the face of the instrument, that such was their intention, leav-"], [364, "342 POLITICAL PARTIES ing those functionaries to grope their Avay to its discovery. Such a question \u2014 one in Avhich the character of our political institutions is so much involved, and upon a right under standing of which their ultimate safety may depend \u2014 should be stripped of every uncertainty. The claim set up for the Supreme Court must be good throughout, or it is not good at all. The principle, that the final decision of constitu tional questions belongs exclusively to the supreme judicial tribunal, set up in Mr. Webster's speech, must be true throughout, or it cannot be true to any extent. It amounts to this : the incumbents of the legislative and executive departments, in respect to questions of constitutional power, are ministerial officers only. Constitutional questions are points in respect to which they have no right to exercise their own discretion, but are bound, at every important step, to look to the judiciary for guidance, and if they omit to adopt its decisions, if it has made any, they do so at their peril: \u2014 the former department at the hazard of having its laws, if the Supreme Court regard them as un constitutional, treated as a nullity, not only when they are relied upon \" in cases in laAv and equity,\" but in all cases, and everywhere. From the nature of their action, members of Congress do not subject themselves to personal responsi bility, except when they act corruptly. But the situation of the incumbent of the executive department is less favor able. Deprived of all discretion, and bound to thus under stand his position, he encounters personal responsibility, in certain cases, Avhichever way he may act. If he find a laAv upon the statute book, approved by one of his pre decessors \u2014 and to relieve the country from which has per haps been one of the reasons for the removal of the latter from office \u2014 a law which he deems unauthorized by the Constitution, but which the Supreme Court holds to be con stitutional, he must eithei violate his oath of office and ex-"], [365, "LN\" THE UNITED STATES. 343 ecute it, or refuse to do so and expose himself to impeach ment for a failure in the discharge of his official duties. If he persists in the observance of a laAv which the Supreme Court has, in a private suit, held to be unconstitutional, he incurs a similar responsibility ; and if he omits its obser vance, he does violence to his own conscience by failing to perform his official duties according to his oath. Let me illustrate this view of the subject by particular and possible cases. Take that referred to by General Hamilton in his papers written in defence of President Washington's pro clamation of neutrality, over the signature of \" Pacificus.\" The President has power, by and with the advice of the Senate, to make treaties Avith foreign governments. Private rights, subject to judicial investigation, often grow out of public treaties. The interpretation and enforcement of these rights belong exclusively to the judiciary, and in the execu tion of its power it may hold the treaty, under which the claim arises, unconstitutional for any of the reasons for which laws may be so regarded. Its decision is binding and final upon the parties and their interests. Then comes the execution of that treaty between the governments that are parties to it. This, on our part, be longs exclusively to the legislative and executive depart ments. The duty of the former is to pass the laws necces sary to its execution, and that of the latter to see to their enforcement, and to do such other acts as he may do, under the Constitution, without a law. A foreign government calls for the interference of these departments to redeem the national faith, pledged through executive instrumentality, and for the redemption of which the executive, and the legislature, where necessary, are the agents designated by the Constitution. They see and feel their duty, but have been rendered poAverless. The Su preme Court has decided the treaty to be unconstitutional."], [366, "344 POLITICAL PARTIES No matter how obscure the parties by whom its inter ference was asked, no matter how unimportant the interest in respect to which the decision was made, from the mo ment it is promulgated, it becomes a rule of action for every department of the government, and every public functionary as Avell as every citizen. If the national leg islature passes a laAv to carry into effect the void treaty its law becomes a nullity. If the executive issues an order for its execution, or tOAvard the performance of the treaty in any way to his subordinates, they are not bound to obey it, and the Supreme Court will sustain them in their con tumacy. If he take measures to enforce his authority, he makes himself amenable to that tribunal. Acting in such a matter as a ministerial officer only, Avithout a right to employ his own discretion, he subjects himself to impeach ment if he persists. Alexander Hamilton \u2014 who, if he was not the one who suggested the latitudinarian doctrine of \" implied poAvers,\" was certainly its most effective supporter, and through life its Avatchful guardian \u2014 in No. 1 of Pacificus, has said that though the judiciary department is charged with the interpretation of treaties, \" it exercises this function only where contending parties bring before it a specific contro versy ; \" that \" it has no concern with pronouncing upon the external political relation of treaties between govern ment and goA'ernment ; \" that \" this proposition is too plain to need being insisted upon ; \" that \" it belongs to the executive department to exercise the function in question, when a proper case for it occurs,\" \"as the interpreter of the national treaties, in those cases in which the judici ary is not competent, \u2014 that is, between government and government ; as the power which is charged with the exe cution of the laws, of which treaties form a part ; as that which is charged with the command and disposition of the public force.\""], [367, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 345 James Madison, in conjunction with Hamilton and Jay, in the numbers of the \" Federalist,\" avows doctrines at war with this assumption of power in the Supreme Court. Thomas Jefferson, Avhose anxious patriotism Avas ahvays alive to such subjects, and the political thoughts and studies of Avhose life AAere exclusively directed toward the protection of human rights through the instrumen tality of free governments, opposed the doctrine vehe mently, from first to last, and long after his retirement from public life, its passions and excitements, expressed himself in regard to it, on different occasions, in terms which folloAv. In 1815, in answer to the direct ques tion put to him by a citizen of Georgia, he says : \u2014 \" The second question, Avhether the judges are invested with exclusive authority to decide on the constitutionality of a laAv, has been heretofore a subject of consideration with me in the exercise of official duties. Certainly there is not a Avord in the Constitution which has given that power to them more than to the executive or legislative branches. Questions of property, of character, and of crime, being ascribed to the judges, through a definite course of legal proceeding, \u2014 laws, involving such ques tions, belong, of course, to them, and as they decide on them ultimately and without appeal, they, of course, decide for themselves. The constitutional validity of the law, or laws, again prescribing executive action, and to be admin istered by that branch ultimately and without appeal, the executive must decide for themselves, also, Avhether, under the Constitution, they are valid or not. So, also, as to laws governing the proceedings of the legislature ; that body must judge for itself 'the constitutionality of the law, and, equally, without appeal or control from its coordinate branches. And, in general, that branch AA'hich is to act ultimately, and Avithout appeal, on any law, is the rightful"], [368, "346 POLITICAL PARTIES expositor of the validity of the law, uncontrolled by the opinions of the other coordinate authorities.\" Again, so late as 1819, in a very interesting letter to Judge Spencer Roaue, he says : \u2014 \" My construction of the Constitution is very different from that you quote. It is that each de partment is truly independent of the others, and has an equal right to decide for itself what is the meaning of the Constitution in the cases submitted to its action ; and es pecially, where it is to act ultimately and AA'ithout appeal. . . . But you intimate a wish that my opinion should be known on this subject. No, dear Sir, I withdraw from all con tests of opinion and resign every thing cheerfully to the generation now in place. They are wiser than Ave were, and their successors will be Aviser than they, from the pro gressive advance of science. Tranquillity is the summum bonum of age. I wish, therefore, to offend no man's opin ion, nor to draw disquieting animadversions on my own. While duty required it, I met opposition with a firm and fearless step. But loving mankind in my individual relations with them, I pray to be permitted to depart in their peace, and, like the superannuated soldier, ' quadra genis siipendiis emeritis,' to hang my arms on the post.\" Mr. Jefferson, in these letters, speaks of his uniform opposition to the opposite doctrine, and refers to the incon venience that may at times arise from conflicting decisions. But that, he thought, might be safely dealt with through the prudence of public functionaries, and he names instances when they Avere so treated : one in England, Avhere an instance of difference occurred, in the time of Lord Holt, between the judges of England and the House of Com mons ; and another in this country, Avhen a difference of opinion was found to exist betAveen the Federal Judiciary and the House of Representatives. The Supreme Court decided, in a case of meum and tuum, that William Duane"], [369, "IN THE UNITED STATES 347 was not a citizen, and the House of Representatives, upon a question of membership, decided that William Smith, whose character of citizenship stood on precisely the same ground, Avas a citizen. These decisions Avere made in high party times, whilst the Federalists Avere in power. Duane was an Irishman, who had married into the family of Dr. Franklin, and was editor of the \"Aurora,\" the most promi nent Republican newspaper. Smith Avas an ardent Feder alist from South Carolina, a man of good talents himself, but who delivered speeches in the House prepared by Ham ilton in his closet, as was charged by Jefferson at the time, and has now been fully proved by the publication of Ham ilton's private papers. But the establishment of the constitutional rule sustained by Jefferson Avould not have saved the country from prac tical inconveniences, Avhich he did not notice because he kneAv them to be unavoidable. A concession to the other great departments of the right to decide for themselves con stitutional questions applicable to, and that necessarily arise in the discharge of, their official functions, still leaves them, to a serious extent, dependent upon the judicial poAver. Whilst it Avould exempt the incumbents from the penalty of impeachment Avhen they act in good faith, they and their subordinates remain liable Avhenever their acts may be con strued into an injurious interference Avith the property or personal rights of individuals, to be called before the judi cial tribunal, to be there subjected to a different interpreta tion of the Constitution from that which they, or their supe riors in authority, have placed upon it, and to be mulcted in damages for their public acts, however pure their motives may have been. In a government, constructed like ours in some degree of conflicting parts, it is ever difficult, if not at times im possible, to prevent such a discrepancy, and those who"], [370, "348 POLITICAL PARTIES framed ours, upon the Avhole, were Avise in not attempting to do so. As a tribute to the personal rights of man and the security of private property, existing provisions go far to atone for Avhatever of individual injustice they may occasion. The legislative department has the power to in demnify those Avho suffer in this way and invariably does so when they have acted in good faith. The losses thus incurred by individuals, in the first instance, are in the end transferred to the whole community, Avhich is abundantly remunerated by the benefits it derives from the system as a Avhole. Should a federal organization ever obtain Avhich shall attempt, through an abuse of its power, to exert a dangerous influence over the Government, to an extent and in a Avay to arrest the attention of the people, they will neither be at a loss for a remedy nor fail in its adoption. But to extend the control of the judiciary, through their decisions \" in cases in law and equity,\" over the action of the other departments in the discharge of the duties assign ed to them, for the extent and gravity of Avhich Ave have only to look to the Constitution, and Avhich, for the most part, steer entirely clear of private and separate interests, would be a measure of a very different character. It Avas upon these public functionaries that the entire political power of the Federal Government was intended to be con ferred, and to the limited tenure by Avhich they held their offices and to their direct responsibility to the people that the latter have ahvays looked for the means to control their action. It is upon this swift and certain responsibility they have hitherto relied for their ability to bring the govern ment back, without great delay, to the republican track designed for it by the Constitution, whenever it might be made to depart from it through the infidelity of their rep resentatives. Truly says Mr. Jefferson, in one of his letters last referred to, \" Avhen the legislative or executive"], [371, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 349 functionaries act unconstitutionally, they are responsible to the people in their elective capacity. The exemption of the judges from that is quite dangerous enough. I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves ; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a Avholesome discre tion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education. This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power.\" Nor have the people been slow to exert their poAvers to reform abuses which they honestly, Avhether erroneously or not, believed to exist, by displacing representatives Avhom they considered unfaithful, Avhenever the occasion has seemed to them of sufficient magnitude to call for its exercise. The commencement of the nineteenth century Avas made forever memorable in our political annals by a display of this power, and it Avas again exerted in 1828, in 1840, in 1844, and in 1852. The result of the election of 1848 was altogether occasioned by divisions in the Democratic party, and I feel that I venture nothing in attributing that of 1840 mainly to a mistake in the public mind, which it has since magnanimously acknowledged, and with that atonement I am more than satisfied. But if the incumbents of the legislative and executive departments have no right to decide for themselves consti tutional questions that arise in the performance of their official functions ; if it be indeed true that the National Legislature, in discharging the important duties of laying and collecting taxes, duties, imposts, and excises ; in bor rowing money on the credit of the United States ; in regu lating commerce Avith foreign nations, and among the sev eral States, and Avith the Indian tribes ; in establishing uniform rules of naturalization and on the subject of bank ruptcies ; in coining money and regulating the value there-"], [372, "350 POLITICAL PARTIES of, and of foreign coins, and fixing the standard of weights and measures ; in providing punishment for counterfeiting the securities and current coiu of the United States ; in es tablishing post-offices and post-roads ; in promoting science and useful arts ; in constituting tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ; in defining aud punishing piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offences against the laAv of nations ; in declaring war ; granting letters of marque and reprisal, and making rules concerning captures on land and water ; in raising and supporting armies ; in providing and maintaining a navy ; in making rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; in providing for calling forth the militia to exe cute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrection and repel invasion ; in providing for organizing armies and disciplin ing the militia, and for governing such parts of them as may be employed in the service of the United States ; in the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction in all cases AA'hatsoever in the ten-mile-square and in the forts of the United States ; and in making necessary and proper laws for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof: and that the President, in assuming command of the army or navy of the United States and of the militia of the several States, when called into their service ; in making treaties by and with the advice of the Senate ; and in the appointment of all the officers of the United States, Avith limited and speci fic exceptions, and in filling up all vacancies that may arise during the recess of the Senate ; in receiving ambassadors and other public ministers ; and in taking care that the laws be faithfully executed, \u2014 are both bound to look to the decisions of the Supreme Court, \" in cases of law and equity\" that are brought before them, for the character"], [373, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 351 and extent of their powers under the Constitution, and to bsigoverned by them, what becomes of the distinguishing feature of Republican Government \u2014 the responsibility of the representative to the people for the faithful perform ance of his duties? A people so intelligent, and Avithal so just as ours, would surely never think of dismissing one branch of their public servants for acts in respect to which they had placed them under the absolute guidance of another branch. To single out one department from the rest by placing its incumbent under a special oath to protect and preserve the Constitution, and then to make it his duty to obey the directions of another in that very func tion, absolutely and unconditionally, would, I cannot but think, be going quite as far in that direction as the charac ter of any people for justice and wisdom could bear. To \\A'hom are the members of the Federal Judiciary re sponsible for the truthfulness of their constitutional exposi tions and for the Avisdom of the steps they take to make them effectual ? To no human being. They can only be displaced by impeachment and criminal conviction. That mere error of judgment, without positive proof of corrup tion, can never be made the basis of such a proceeding, is knoAvn to all. Is it not, then, most apparent that to place the fidelity to the Federal Constitution of the representa tives of the people and of the States and of most of the effective officers employed in the conduct of public affairs, save only those that are of a judicial character, under the supervision of that department, is nothing less than to di vest the GoA'ernment of its republican features and to sub stitute in its place the control of an irresponsible judicial oligarchy \u2014 to make the Constitution a lie, and turn to mockery its most formal provisions, designed to secure to the people a control over the action of the Government under its authority ? Is it not remarkable that a doctrine,"], [374, "352 POLITICAL PARTIES so clearly anti-republican in its character and tendencies, should have been so long kept on foot under a system truly republican as ours, and may we not trace its origin to the same inexhaustible fountain from whence have pro ceeded the most tenacious of our party divisions \u2014 an in extinguishable distrust, on the part of numerous and pow erful classes, of the capacities and dispositions of the great body of their felloAV-citizens ?

Under no authority do they feel their interests to be safer than under that Avhich is subject to the judicial power, and in no way could their policy be more effectually promoted than by taking power from those departments of the Government over Avhich the people have full control, and accumulating it in that over which they may fairly be said to have none."], [375, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 353 CHAPTER VIII.

Of this no one will have a right to complain, so long as those Avho so refer confine themselves to facts ; for truth is truth, Avhatever may be the circumstances under Avhich it is applied, and Avrong is Avrong, by Avhomsoever it may be committed and by Avhat ever party it may be sustained. It will be alleged that the Supreme Court, now composed of gentlemen Avho are ac knoAvledged members of the Democratic party, has in that 23"], [376, "354 POLITICAL PARTIES case set up the right to guide the official action of the executive and legislative departments of the Government upon a great constitutional question, \u2014 that the Executive has recognized that right, aud has promised to conform his own course to it when exercised, and that these pro ceedings have received the approbation and support of the Democratic party. In the notice I propose to take of that case, it is not my intention to discuss the correctness or incorrectness of the decision that was made in respect to the poAver of Congress to legislate upon the subject of slavery in the Territories. I will however state in advance and in few words the vieAV I noAV take of the general subject. The acquiescence of the country in the power of Con gress referred to, from the Presidency of Washington to that of Polk inclusive, is Avell known. Every Presi dent signed bills for carrying it into effect, Avhen any such became necessary and Avere presented for their ap proval, and the other great departments of the Govern ment not only complied with the rule but, in innumerable instances, recognized its validity. This continued until the year 1848, Avhen a point, which had so long been considered settled, AA'as brought in question by an opinion expressed by Geneial Cass, then being a candidate for the Presidency, in a letter to Mr. Nicholson, of Ten nessee, adverse to the povAers of Congress. The Demo cratic party, Avhose candidate he was, adopted his opin ions, and the consequences Avere a rupture in that party, the elevation of an old-school Federalist to the Presi dency, and an administration of the Federal Government upon the long exploded principles of Federalism. In 1852 the Democracy of the Union, instructed by experi ence in regard to the destructive tendency of slavery agi tations, resolved to avoid them in future, united on General"], [377, "LN* THE UNITED STATES. 355 Pierce as their candidate, supported him on their old and time-honored principles, and elected him by a triumphant majority. This result, so auspicious to the country, 'was unhappily followed by the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and a consequent reopening of the agitation upon the subject of slavery, in a form and under influences more portentous of evil than any which had before attended it. I received information of that event whilst I Avas abroad, a sojourner in a country which Avas under the domin ion of an absolute monarch, \u2014 circumstances which never fail to increase the attachment of a true-hearted American, however orthodox he may have been before in his devotion, to home and its inestimable institutions. Although for ever Avithdrawn from public life, I could not be indif ferent to a measure promising such startling consequences, Having had full opportunities to become acquainted Avith the evil which the infusion of slavery agitation into the partisan feelings of the country AA-as capable of producing, I felt, in all their force, the dangers to which our political fabric would be exposed by that act, and mourned over its adoption. Whatever may be thought or said of it in other respects, in regard to its influence in exciting sectional animosities to a far more perilous height than they had ever reached before there is not now room for two opinions. Under the feelings of the moment, I naturally extended to the substitute Congress had provided, the odium which, in my view, belonged to the act of repeal, and could see no adequate relief save in a restoration of the Compromise. But as passion subsided I became convinced of the imprac ticability of that step, and turned my attention to a more careful consideration of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and I became satisfied that, if honestly executed, it was all that"], [378, "356 POLITICAL PARTIES could, under existing circumstances, be done, or, perhaps, desired. Havings been a second time invited bv my old political friends of Tammany Hall, before the Presidential election of 1856, to submit my vieAvs upon the then state of the question, I gave them in a letter which presented the whole subject in a form and Avas written in a spirit which many thought Avell calculated to make favorable impressions on well-intentioned and sober-minded men. It contained a simple and truthful description of the position I had before occupied upon the slavery subject, an exposi tion of the reasons by Avhich I Avas yet satisfied that it had been well taken, and of the ground of my expectation that Mr. Buchanan Avould do all in his power to cause the Kansas-Nebraska Act to be carried into full and fair effect. I have read all the opinions given by the judges in the Dred Scott case with care, and Avill state the impressions which they haA'e made upon my mind. I had never ex amined the question, and learned, Avith serious misgivings as to its correctness, that the court had decided that a man of African birth, though free and, in the State in Avhich he resided, entitled to all the rights of a citizen, was not also a citizen of the United States. My mind remained in this state, with partial alleviations of my anxiety, derived from newspaper sketches of the subject referring to instances in which the principle had been acted upon in the adminis tration of public affairs, until I read very deliberately the voluminous opinions of the judges. The able, judge like, and I may add, statesmanlike, vieAvs taken by Chief Justice Taney and by Justice Daniel, of that branch of the subject, have satisfied me that the judgment of the court upon it Avas right. I am now convinced that the sense in Avhich the word \" citizen \" was used by those Avho framed and ratified the Federal Constitution was not in tended to embrace the African race, whose ancestors were"], [379, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 357 brought to this country and sold in slavery. I shall con tent myself with stating the result of my reflections, without going into details, as that would be to re-argue the question, Avhich would be foreign to my present ob ject. I do not say that the subject is free from difficul ties. No adverse opinion could pass through the ordeal of so subtle and masterly an argument as that of Justice Curtis, Avho bestowed more attention upon the point than his dissenting brother, and escape unscathed. The Aveight of facts and argument is, notwithstanding, in my judgment, on the side of the decision of the court. A decision in favor of a free black man's right to insti tute a suit in the Federal court, on the grounds of citizen ship and his residence in a different State from the de fendant, Avould undoubtedly establish his right under the Constitution to the enjoyment in a slave State of all the privileges allowed to its own citizens. The extent to which such a construction and the practical operation of the rights which might be claimed under it would in crease the difficulties, already so great, of maintaining the unity and harmonious action of the Federal system, will be more and more apparent the deeper the matter is consid ered. I think it is quite certain that if the Constitution had been supposed to contain a provision legitimately authoriz ing such consequences, it would not have been agreed to by the slaveholding States, nor, in view of the liberal spirit evinced even by the latter at the time of the formation of the Constitution in regard to the extension of slavery, would such a provision have been insisted upon by their brethren of the States Avhich had the happiness to be com paratively free 'from the institution. The decision must, therefore, be regarded as fortunate, as I cannot but hold it to be correct. For though the personal rights of individ uals, however humble their position in society, are not the"], [380, "358 POLITICAL PARTIES less important and their protection no less the duty of gov ernment, yet the great community may felicitate itself that claims like these, \u2014 the practical enjoyment of which, Avhile of little value, relatively, to the few who assert them, may endanger the peace and welfare of millions, \u2014 are extin guished through the agency of the organ of the Government constituted for their adjustment. It is in such cases, when confined to its necessary and legitimate duties, that the salutary influence of that high tribunal is felt by all. The plaintiff, Dred Scott, alleged in his declaration \u2014 as he was bound to allege to give the Circuit Court jurisdic tion of the cause \u2014 that he Avas a citizen of Missouri. Sandford, the defendant, plead to the jurisdiction and alleged for cause of abatement that Scott Avas not a citi zen of Missouri as averred in his declaration, \" because he is a negro of African descent ; his ancestors were of pure African blood and toere brought into this country and sold as negro slaves.\" To this plea there was a demurrer by which the facts set forth in the plea Avere admitted, and upon the issue in law thus joined the Circuit Court gave judgment that the demurrer be sustained. The plea, it will be perceived, did not aver that Scott was a slave, or state any fact from Avhich the inference that he was such unavoidably resulted. The plaintiff' Avas, therefore, to be re garded in the decision upon the demurrer as a free man, and was so regarded by the Circuit Court and by the Su preme Court.1 The effect of the final decision, assuming it to have been the opinion of the court, Avas that the judg ment of the Circuit Court upon the demurrer be reversed, and a mandate issued directing the suit to be dismissed 1 The opinion of the Supreme Missouri within the meaning of the Court is thus summed up by the Constitution of the United States, Chief Justice : 44And upon a full and and not entitled as such to sue in its careful consideration of the subject courts ; and consequently that the the court is of opinion that upon the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction of facts stated in the plea in abate- the cause and that the judgment on ment Lred Scott was not a citizen of the plea in abatement is erroneous.\""], [381, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 359 from that court for want of jurisdiction. This disposed of every question in the case that entered into, or could exert the slightest influence upon the personal rights of the par ties or the ultimate judgment of the Supreme Court. Judge Daniel in his opinion \u2014 inferior to none that were delivered \u2014 admitted this in so many words : \"According to the view taken of the case as applicable to the demurrer to the plea in abatement in this cause,\" (said he,) \" the question subse quently raised upon the several pleas in bar might be passed by, as requiring neither a particular examination nor an adjudication directly upon them.\" This was, beyond all doubt, the true condition of the case. Every other ques tion bore upon one point only, and that Avas, Avhether Scott had become a free man, \u2014 a question not put in issue by the plea in abatement, and according to the opinion of the court of no real consequence in the decision of the cause. The result Avould, therefore, seem to be that every thing subsequently said and done by the court was extrajudi cial \u2014 obiter dicta decisions, Avhich, not affecting the merits of the case, are of no authority. But the court, anticipating such an objection, made very considerable efforts, in advance, to repel and disprove it. Both the Chief Justice and Judge Wayne insisted earnestly on the circumstance that this Avas a writ of error to the Circuit Court and not to a State court; that the question did not relate to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, but of its OAvn inferior court, and that in such cases it was the prac tice and the duty of the Supreme Bench to take a Avider range in the correction of errors than when the case came up from the State courts, and the question Avas Avhether the Supreme Court had a right to act in the matter. In the latter case they admitted that the judges ought to stop the moment they found that none existed, and if they did not, all beyond Avas extrajudicial. They urged that the general"], [382, "360 POLITICAL PARTIES judgment in favor of the defendant, in a case in Avhich the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction, Avas an error apparent on the record Avhich it Avas proper in the Supreme Court to cor rect by a reversal of that judgment, and that for this purpose it became necessary to decide the issue presented by the special plea Avhich involved the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise Act ; and, finally, that the case was one which the court had not sought, but Avhich had been brought before it in the regular course of judicial proceed ings; that the issues it involved Avere those which the parties had presented for the decision of the court, and that it Avas its duty to dispose of them. That the court had neither sought the case nor exerted any agency in framing the issues it presented Avas undeni ably true, and the reasons assigned in justification of its course are certainly entitled to great respect. How far their strength is impaired by the following considerations, those avIio have sufficient curiosity to study the case will judge for themselves. That the parties, at the commence ment of the proceedings in the Supreme Court, Avere both desirous to have the issue joined upon the merits examined and decided upon by that court, is very evident, but it is questionable whether the Avishes and interests of both Avere not superseded by its action. The plaintiff secure, as he supposed, by the stand he had acquired in the Circuit Court through the decision of that tribunal upon the demurrer in his favor, was of course solicitous to reverse the judgment which had been given by that court in favor of the defend ant upon the merits. The defendant had two objects in view, \u2014 the first of which Avas to reverse the judgment upon the demurrer, and, if he failed in that, to sustain the judg ment in his favor upon the merits. On the argument of the cause it Avas made a grave question whether the point raised by the plea to the jurisdiction was legally before the"], [383, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 361 Supreme Court, \u2014 a question of no small difficulty and one in regard to which there Avas a diversity of opinion to the last, even among the judges Avho were in favor of the de cision of the court. It was contended by the plaintiff in error that the defendant had conceded the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court by pleading over, and that he had not brought his Avrit of error to reverse his oavii judgment. But the Supreme Court overruled these objections, reversed the judgment in his favor, and directed the suit to be dismissed from the Circuit Court for the Avant of jurisdiction. By this decision, which the plaintiff' could not foresee, and Avas not bound to anticipate, all his interest in a decision upon the merits was of course superseded. The defendant having succeeded in driving the plaintiff' out of the court below, could have no possible desire that the judgment rendered in his own favor should be reversed ; affirmed it could not be on account of the want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court. His application to the Supreme Court to have that point of the case acted upon was therefore super seded by its OAvn act. Such anomalous proceedings, as an elaborate opinion in favor of all the claims set up by a party terminating with the reversal of a judgment in his favor, are happily of rare occurrence in judicial tribunals so able and elevated as ours. It is perhaps questionable whether the judgments for the defendant in the court below did not fall with the dismissal of the cause from before the Circuit Court for want of jurisdiction, without farther interference on the part of the Supreme Court. Still in a^case involv ing so many and such extraordinary complications, the latter might well feel itself at liberty to decide also the questions that were raised and had been very fully dis cussed before it upon the merits of the cause. But on what grounds it could regard such a course as obligatory and necessary to the complete administration of justice"], [384, "362 POLITICAL PARTIES between the parties litigant before it, I cannot see, and I find it difficult to believe that the members of the court Avould have given themselves the trouble to prepare such elaborate opinions upon questions the decision of which Avas not necessary to the judgment of the court, if their solution could have had no other bearing than upon the personal rights of Dred Scott. I think it more likely that the judges who united in the opinion that the Missouri Compromise Act Avas unconstitutional, seeing the extraor dinary revolution which its repeal had produced in the polit ical and fraternal feelings of the people of the United States, and sincerely believing the safety of the Union en dangered by continued agitation upon so disturbing a sub ject, hoped to arrest it by the judgment of the Supreme Court upon the point in question, \u2014 a step Avhich, if not actually called for, they yet believed fully justified by the case before them. Chief Justice Taney, who, by his superior intellect and elevation of character, was enabled to give to such a move ment its greatest impulse, Avas not exempt from an original bias in favor of the doctrine adA'anced by Mr. Webster in the discussions upon the Bank Veto, when the latter declared, \u2014 \" Hitherto it has been thought that the final decision of constitutional questions belonged to the supreme judicial tribunal. The very nature of free government, it has been supposed, enjoins this ; and our Constitution, moreover, has been understood so to provide clearly and expressly.\"1 The peculiarity gf these expressions challenges our attention in passing. The guarded and sly manner in Avhich they put forth the doctrines of the old Federal party, Avithout as suming the responsibility of affirming them, is in their author's best manner. Nor did the Chief Justice stand alone in that position \" The italics are mine."], [385, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 363 among his judicial brethren. He had occupied a distin guished place in the Federal ranks to an advanced period in his professional life; he had acquired an enviable fame at the Bar, and had left it, as most old lawyers do, Avith feel ings of admiration and respect not only for his professional brethren but for the Bench, in the influence and power of Avhich they seldom fail to take the deepest interest. It was hardly to be expected that he should, on taking his seat, have proved insensible to the esprit du corps which had long prevailed in and around that high tribunal, and Avhich, directed by the plastic hand of John Marshall, had charmed minds as strong as his own, even although professing op posite political principles. Story and Thompson, who had been stars of considerable magnitude in the old Republican party, were in succession subdued by Marshall's magnetic influence to conditions in this regard favorable to the ac ceptance of almost any extension of the doctrine of the supremacy of the Supreme Court. Although the master-mind which gave it life and by which it Avas installed has departed, the proceedings now the subject of our review give us abundant reason to apprehend that the spirit has retained its place and power. In respect to many hardly contested issues brought before the Court, occurring vacancies and new appointments have doubtless worked important changes in its opinions ; but on that of the supremacy of the judicial over the other depart ments of the Government in constitutional questions, there are yet, it is to be feared, few dissentients on the Bench, and least of all on the question from which opposition to the decision in the Dred Scott case proceeded. That de cision was therefore pronounced under the full persuasion that, in addition to its quieting effect upon the public mind, it, of rifdit, ought to have a controlling influence over the action of the other departments of the Government ; that"], [386, "364 POLITICAL PARTIES it ought to influence the action of Congress in particular, and that, if an attempt should be made to revive the con demned act, it would guide the course of the Executive. Judge Daniel, in the modest, hesitating terms in Avhich he expressed his concurrence in the farther proceedings, Avhich he admitted to be unnecessary, seems to have thought it due to the political school in Avhich he had been reared to put some qualification upon the poAver of the court to set tle the conflicting views upon the subject that prevailed out of doors and might find place in the other departments of the Government. But my worthy friend, Judge Wayne, had no such reserve. He thought that the case, in addition to private rights of great value, involved \" constitutional principles of the highest importance, about Avhich there had become such a difference of opinion that the peace and har mony of the country required the settlement of them by judicial decision.\" The Chief Justice was too circumspect not to content himself with action, and not to avoid expressions open to unfavorable criticism. I cannot suffer the allusions I have made to circumstances in the previous career of this excellent man to pass without a disclaimer of the slightest intention to impeach his motives in any thing. I have known him long and well. We stood shoulder to shoulder by the side of General Jackson at the most eventful period of his second term of office, and did all we could do to sustain him by our cooperation and advice. I do not know that we differed on any point; and I do know that there could not have been a more upright and vigilant public officer than he was; nor could any man have had a more faithful or a more efficient friend than he proved to that noble old man. I witnessed from beginning to end the virulent and violent persecutions he experienced at the hands of his old Federal and Whig friends, and was"], [387, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 365 deeply affected by the steady, self-possessed and manly spirit with which he endured them. This impressed me Avith a respect for his character and a personal attachment which no after-occurrence has weakened. He Avas my choice as the candidate of the Democratic party for the Presidency in 1852, and there has been no time since at Avhich I Avould not have rejoiced to see him at the head of the Govern ment. I Avould have expected to find in him some defects, Avhich being bred in the bone would come out in the flesh, but that never Avas Avith me, as Avas known to my familiar associates in political life, an objection to the elevation to office of gentlemen whose political status Avas similar to his own. I took them cum onere, and sometimes, though cer tainly not always, gained by the experiment. He Avas a man of innate as well as cultivated integrity in sentiment and action, and the longer VA'elive the higher value we learn to place on this quality in a public man. Conscious of the importance of sincerity and truthfulness in all the move ments of Government, Avhose office it is to enforce the observance of moral obligation, men of this character can never be induced to countenance public measures unless they are not only pure in themselves, but supported by pure means. Such a man Avas Roger B. Taney, and such men I never suspect of unworthy motives in any thing they say or do. Neither have I the slightest doubt of the good intentions by Avhich his associates on the bench were influ enced in the proceedings of Avhich I am speaking. Yet I cannot but think that in going beyond the necessities of the case they made a grievous mistake. The question, Avhich the court undertook to settle, was political, and had assumed a partisan character of great virulence. There are two classes in every community Avhose inter ference in politics is always and very naturally distasteful to sincere republicans, and those are judges and clergy-"], [388, "366 POLITICAL PARTIES men. Their want of sympathy, as a general rule, for popular rights, is knoAvn throughout the world, and in this country that repugnance received an enduring im pulse from the unanimity Avith Avhich a vast majority of both classes banded themselves on the side of power, in the stormy time of the first Adams, and from the bitterness with which they railed from the bench and the pulpit at the public-spirited and patriotic men, Avho sought to relieve the country from misrule. Both were again called to the political field, though on different sides, during our recent troubles; yet the circumstance that the judges took part Avith a majority of those who constituted the Democratic party of the United States Avas not sufficient to neutralize the dislike to their interference in politics Avhich was seated in the Democratic mind. To add a deeper shade to this trespass upon the time-honored creed of the Democratic party, the anti-Democratic doctrine Avas conveyed to the public in a form professing to be a necessary adjudication in the regular course of the administration of justice, whilst it is, to a considerable extent at least, exposed to the imputation of having in truth been an extrajudicial opinion, voluntarily and not necessarily delivered, \u2014 a mode of bringing before the country the opinions of the supreme bench, formerly much in use, but Avhich, since the case of Marbury and Madison, has been peculiarly repulsive to Democrats, and which Mr. Jefferson spent much time in holding up to odium. To do full justice to Mr. Buchanan in respect to the extent to which this action of the Supreme Court received his sanction, it becomes necessary to state Avith more pre cision than might otherwise be deemed requisite, in con nection with admitted facts, his avowals on the subject, which are contained in his inaugural address. The Kansas-Nebraska Act was designed to settle, as far"], [389, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 367 as an act of Congress could do so, two points, viz. \u2014 1st, that Congress possessed no power to legislate upon the subject of slavery in the Territories, and therefore it re pealed the Missouri Compromise Act ; and 2d, that it belongs to the majority of the people of the Territory to decide Avhether slavery shall or shall not exist Avithin its bounds. President Buchanan treated every point which the Kansas Act professed to settle as removed from the scope of par tisan warfare, and congratulated the country on the happy conception through which the Congress had accomplished results so desirable. That body recognized in the fullest manner the poAver and the right of a majority of the people of Kansas to decide upon their domestic institutions, including the sub ject of slavery, but Avas silent as to the period Avhen that right should be exercised. That was, therefore, left an open question, and the President expressed his views in re gard to it in the following words: \"A difference of opinion has arisen in regard to the time Avhen the people of a Ter ritory shall decide this question for themselves. This is happily a matter of little practical importance, and besides it is a judicial question, Avhich legitimately belongs to the Supreme Court of the United States, before whom it is now pending, and will, it is understood, be speedily and finally settled. To their decision, in common with all good citizens, I shall cheerfully submit, Avhatever this may be, though it has been my individual opinion,\" etc. It is not necessary for the purpose of this reference to inquire either how far that question was decided by the Supreme Court, in the case referred to, or Avhether the President does justice to its importance. In respect to the latter point it is Avell known that a contrary opinion is extensively entertained. It Avill not be denied that the case"], [390, "368 POLITICAL PARTIES he speaks of Avas that of Dred Scott, and that the questions to be decided in it related only to the personal rights and interests of the parties to the suit. It is in the settlement of such only that the Supreme Court could exercise juris diction upon such a subject, and all will admit that if it belongs to a Territory to determine the question of the toleration of slavery there, the occasion of the formation of its State constitution will be a proper time for the settle ment of that question, if a majority consent that the decis ion shall be so long deferred. The question in regard to the true time can, therefore, only arise, Avhen a majority wish to act upon the subject at an earlier period. If such an attempt be made, the most extreme advocates for judi cial supremacy would not pretend that it would be com petent for the Supreme Court to arrest the proceedings by injunction or writ of prohibition, or any other process. It could, therefore, only be in cases involving individual in terests, Avhich might be supposed to be affected by such a proceeding on the part of the Territory, that the judicial tribunals could interfere, and it was to such a case that the President Avas understood to refer. It was of an expected decision of the court in a case in law, brought for the set tlement of private rights, that the President spoke, when he said that, though he had an opinion of his own, he would, notAvithstanding, submit to the decision of the court upon the point, Avhatever that might be. By this declaration he announced to his constituents that in the exercise of the executive poAA'er upon the subject, AvheneA'er that might become necessary, he would take notice of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case he referred to as then pending, and would feel it to be his duty to maintain the rule it should lay down in respect to the particular ques tion of which he spoke, and a fortiori in respect to the main question, the right of the Territory to act upon the matter,"], [391, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 369 and that he would do so because the court had so decided without reference to his individual opinion in the premises \u2014 the consequence of which would be, that if his official sanction or cooperation should become necessary to a set tlement of the question of slavery by the people of the Territory, he Avould give it if the people had acted con formably to the rule prescribed by the court., or withhold it if they had acted contrary thereto ; and that if Congress should undertake to legislate upon any part of the subject against the decision of the Supreme Court, in resnect to its constitutional powers, he Avould withhold his assent from any bill of that character Avhich the two houses might pass. It is our duty, and must be our aim, to interpret the language employed by the President according to what we, in good faith, believe to have been his intention. Attempts to pervert the sense of what is said by a man placed in his situation and acting under his grave responsibilities, would not injure him, and could not fail to recoil upon their au thor. If, dealing with his avowals in that spirit, we are yet bound to believe that the declaration which I have de scribed is the legitimate interpretation and effect of his language, it is not only our right but our duty to speak of it as we conscientiously think it deserves. It can be scarcely necessary to say that those who regard the Repub lican principles of government applicable to the question before us, as they have been set forth in this work, as the true and only principles of the Constitution, must either abandon the tenets of their predecessors and their own convictions, or treat the declaration of Mr. Buchanan as a voluntary and seemingly a ready sacrifice of a most cher ished principle of the Democratic faith \u2014 the reciprocal independence of the great departments of government ; a principle the importance of which was apparent to and 24"], [392, "370 POLITICAL PARTIES insisted on by the friends of liberty long before the estab- lishment of our independence, and for the practical enforce- ment of which the American Revolution was regarded as ' presenting the best opportunity ever offered. For the security of this principle the fathers of our political school made the greatest efforts, and the invasion of it was met by Mr. Jefferson, at the commencement of his administration, with characteristic firmness, and was the subject of his anxious watchfulness during the closing scenes of his life. The recent action of the Democratic party upon this sub- ject must be considered with many grains of allowance. The long-continued support of a majority of the people, \u2014 the only test of political merit in a Republic, \u2014 has secured a preference for its principles of which it may well be proud ; and the general fidelity of its members to the faith they profess is creditably illustrated by the fact that after all the changes to which its organization has been exposed, its ranks, whatever may be the case as to some of its leaders, are mainly composed of men with like dispositions with those by whom that organization was effected ; yet its best friends set up in its behalf no claim to infallibility, nor do they pretend that its members have never failed in their duty to the cause. They know that men do not escape from their liability to err by uniting with a political association. Circumstances of the gravest character have besides put the adherence of its members to the princi- ples of their party, in the matter under consideration, to a severer test than any to which they have hitherto been exposed. For the first time since its ascent to power in the Federal Government, two of the three great departments, the Executive and the Judicial, are presided over by gentle- men who, though raised to their places by its favor, had not been bred in its ranks but joined them at comparatively advanced periods in their lives, with opinions formed and"], [393, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 371 matured in an antagonist school. The motives by which these gentlemen were led to enlist under the Democratic banner Avere, beyond question, of the purest character, and the high position to which they have been raised by their new friends shows that they were appreciated as they deserved. Most of the principles and opinions they formed in the ranks of the adversary have doubtless been changed, and ours adopted in their stead, but, unfortu nately, that Avhich is the subject of our present remark appears not to have been among the number. Several of the members of the President's cabinet and of the bench of the Supreme Court, perhaps a majority of each, stand in the same category. In Congress the state of things is not materially different ; Avhen we look at the gentlemen who have been most prominent in the Kansas embroilment, on the side of the administration, we find an unprecedented number of the same class. It is most proper to avoid referring unnecessarily to names in a work of this character, especially Avhen such reference is not for particular commendation, but the innocence of the motive in this case will excuse a slight departure from the rule. Among the most prominent of those Avho have taken the lead on the Democratic side in the two houses of Congress in respect to the affairs of Kansas, will be found the names of Toombs, of the Senate, and Stephens, of the House \u2014 both from Georgia, and both, for aught I know or have ever known, honorable men, doubtless actuated by good motives. I know neither personally, and never heard of either particularly, save as extreme partisans in the ranks of our opponents. I will not vouch for precise accuracy as to dates, but I am persuaded I will not err materially in saying that neither professed to belong to the Democratic party until after their appointment and election to their present posts. All of these gentlemen not merely believe,"], [394, "372 POLITICAL PARTIES as it is very natural that they should, in this supremacy of the judicial poAA-er in such matters, \u2014 an idea always here tofore scouted by the Democracy of the land, \u2014 but they maintain it before the country, under circumstances rendered very imposing by their high official positions, as a test of party fidelity. The Executive, Avhose eleA'ation to power cost the Democracy so fearful a struggle, and from Avhose success so much Avas and still is expected, has done this clearly and undisguisedly in respect to the support of Lecompton, and virtually in respect to the question of judicial supremacy. Mr. Stephens offered a resolution de claring the support of the Lecompton Act, a measure closely interwoven Avith the principle of which Ave are speaking, as a test question in the Democratic caucus over Avhich pre sided Mr. Cochran, \u2014 a promising young man from NeAv York, descended from a family as thoroughly imbued with Hamiltonian Federalism as any this State has produced (one of them Hamilton's brother-in-law), brought up till he arrived at man's estate among the straightest of the sect, and on that account entitled to greater credit for throAving himself Avith becoming zeal into the Democratic ranks, but for the same reason less likely to embrace their creed in its full extent, and less qualified to instruct them in the principles of their faith. But there is an obstacle to an adherence on the part of the Democratic party to their ancient faith, in respect to these proceedings of the court, far more potent than those to Avhich I have referred. This arises from the cir cumstance that those proceedings had their origin mainly in a sincere belief that they Avere necessary to protect a paramount and absorbing interest in nearly half the States of the Confederacy, with the security and quiet of which the citizens of those States believe their happiness and welfare to be inseparably involved. These are also the"], [395, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 373 States in Avhich the Democratic party possesses compara tively its greatest influence, and in some of which the true principles of the Constitution have in general, and especially at earlier periods in our history, been sought after with great avidity, and in Avhich that under consider ation found its earliest, ablest, and most persevering sup porters. I need not speak of the control Avhich this belief is capable of exerting over most of those Avho are by their position brought within the range of its practical operation. Minds thus excited find 110 insuperable difficulty in placing the object of their solicitude upon the footing of the salus populi, or in looking upon any measure that tends to its security as justifiable, because it is in execution of the suprcma lex. Before such a feeling, so widely diffused, constitutional objections and all the principles which on ordinary occasions bind the consciences and influence the actions of men, are seldom, if ever, of much avail. Neither will full justice have been done to the subject, notwithstanding this formidable array of hindrances in the path of duty, if I omit to refer to the inducement, always so strong with political parties, to avail themselves of every opportunity that presents or seems to present itself to \" commend the poisoned chalice \" to the lips of their opponents \u2014 a temptation they find it hard to resist, however much their OAvn hands or consciences may have to be soiled in the operation. Few of the present genera tion Avho have made themselves at all conversant Avith the course of public affairs, need to be told how constant and openly professed has been the faith of the old Federalists and their political successors in the infallibility and om nipotence of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States upon constitutional questions. The com plaints of the old Republicans and their successors upon that head have been both loud and long continued. Wheu"], [396, "374 POLITICAL PARTIES they made the country ring Avith them in respect to the unconstitutionality and tyrannical character of the Alien and Sedition LaAA's, the ready and only reply of their opponents was, that it belonged to the judicial power to decide upon their constitutionality, and that their expediency Avas a matter to be solved in the breast of Congress. In more modern times, when its unconstitutionality was objected to the second Bank of the United States, the decision of the Su preme Court in favor of the power of Congress to establish it was the equally ready and confident answer to al! com plaints on that ground. Other and similar instances might be referred to, but it is unnecessary. For the first time since the formation of the present Government the su preme bench, considerably changed in the political com plexion of its members and tempted, doubtless more or less under the pressure of an all-absorbing popular influence at the South, to borrow a leaf from the book of our political opponents, has undertaken to control, adversely to the views of those opponents, a great political question by an extrajudicial decision of the court. As one of the con sequences, a hue and cry has been raised against that august tribunal, hitherto revered by them as the only political sanctuary; trusted as the ark of safety; \u2014 a clamor reach ing to a demand for the reorganization of the court itself; \u2014 a point never even approached by the Democracy Avhen their displeasure has been raised to the greatest height by its unauthorized assumptions of political power. It is not then surprising that portions of the Democratic party should have been led to give the qualified assent which they have given to the Federal principle under consideration. I say qualified, for the guarded manner in Avhich those Avho so assent have urged the influence which the decision of the court ought to have upon the question, must have been apparent to all; and this has been very much to their"], [397, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 375 credit, especially in the slaveholding States. The refer ences Avhich have been made to the doings of the judiciary, in most instances, have savored more of what is known in the laAv as a plea of estoppel than of a claim of right, \u2014 a plea by which the truth or falsity of any matter brought for ward by one party is waived, and its admission resisted on the ground that the party relying upon it has precluded him self from introducing it by some act or concession appear ing upon the record, or established aliunde. If the doctrine of estoppel could be applied to politians, it Avould certainly not be difficult to show that the Federal party and its suc cessors are very clearly estopped from objecting to the action of the Supreme Court of Avhich we have been speaking. It may, under such circumstances, be safely assumed that the Democratic party has not committed itself to a departure from its professed principles upon this subject to an extent which it cannot be relieved from Avithout a sacrifice of self-respect on the part of its members, or Avith out serious prejudice to its AA-ell-earned title to the confi dence of the country. That it will so relieve itself its past good sense and active patriotism forbid us to doubt. Let us hope that the protecting care of a kind Providence, which has hitherto carried our country in safety through so many perils, will in His oavii good time afford us a breathing spell at least, from the baleful excitements attend ant upon slavery agitation. When that happy period arrives ..... besides the incalculable advantage it will bring to the highest interests of all parties and all sections of our country, the Democrats in the slaveholding States will not fail to see the folly of asking their political coadjutors in the free States to cooperate in the support of measures and principles in sustaining which they cannot be sustained at home.

In deciding the character of parties by their works we Avill but follow the dictates of unerring wisdom, by which Ave are taught to judge the tree by its fruit. A great question, and naturally the first that arose in the formation of our political system, related to the power that should be reserved to, and the treatment that should be extended towards, the State governments. Rivalries between them and the Federal head could not be prevented. To mitigate the evil by dealing justly and Avisely with the State authorities, Avas all that could be done. Each of the"], [400, "378 POLITICAL PARTIES great parties which have divided the country had, from the beginning, its OAvn, and they were conflicting opinions, in respect to the spirit in which this important subject should be dealt with. These, and the acts and sayings they gave rise to, have been herein freely spoken of, and what has been said need not be repeated. The facts and circumstances brought into view, consisting in a considerable degree of the reiterated declarations of the parties themselves, Avith a mass of others supplied by contemporaneous history, fully justify the belief that if Hamilton and Morris, and the influential men of the party of which the former Avas through life the almost absolute leader, could have had their way, the State governments would have been reduced to conditions in regard to power and dignity which AA'ould not only have destroyed their usefulness, but from Avhich they must have sunk into insignificance and contempt ; to Avhich state it AA'as the avowed wish of those leaders to depress them. This desire was frustrated in the Federal Convention, not so much through favorable feeling- towards the State authorities as by a conviction on the part of a majority \u2014 a conviction which could neither be disguised nor suppressed \u2014 that the old Anti-Federal party would be sufficiently strengthened by a plan of the Constitution, against which a design clearly hostile to the State govern ments could be fairly charged, to enable that party to pre vent its ratification. John Quincy Adams, to his decla ration that the \" Constitution was extorted from the grind ing necessity of a reluctant nation,\" might have added, with equal truth, that the Constitution, in the form it bore on this point, was extorted from the Convention by a necessity not less effectual. Hamilton's design to attain the object he had failed to accomplish in the Convention, by \"administrating\" the Constitution, in the language of Madison, into a thing very different from what they both"], [401, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 379 knew it Avas intended to be, Avas defeated by the old Re publican party. The lowest point to which the State governments Avould have been reduced, if the influence that was exerted to lessen their power had not been defeated in the way I have described, must of necessity be matter of speculation only. Hamilton, as Ave have seen, declared candidly that he kneAv of no reason why he did not advocate their total overthrow other than the manifest strong desire of the people for their retention ; whilst Morris, with equal openness, said that if they could not abolish them altogether, it Avas neverthe less desirable to pull the teeth of the serpents. There can be but little doubt that a complete triumph of the Federal policy would have resulted in a decline of the State governments, if they escaped extinguishment, from the condition which they occupied at the period of the recognition of our Independence to mere municipal authorities, Avithout sufficient power to render them ex tensively useful \u2014 fit theatres only for the exercise and enjoyment of the patronage of the Federal government. The Anti-Federalists, like their opponents, could only look with favor on one side of this great question. I do not complain of their partiality for the State governments, for it was in them a natural and inherited feeling, one which had been cherished with equal ardor from a remote period in our history by men whose places they filled and whom they most resembled. Their fault was the exclu siveness of their preference. They could not and did not deny that a general government of some sort was indispen sable, and they should therefore have stood ready to confer upon it such powers as were necessary to enable it to sustain itself and to qualify it for the successful perform ance of the duties to be assigned to it. This they would not do. They, on the contrary, allowed their local preju 4>"], [402, "380 POLITICAL PARTIES dices and their suspicions, in some instances Avell founded but unwisely indulged, to lead them to persistent refusals to concede to the Federal head means Which a sufficient experience had shown to be absolutely necessary to good government. Public and private interests suffered from that cause, and they Avere justly held responsible for the consequences. Their conduct Avas as unjustifiable and as suicidal as was the unmitigated warfare Avaged by leading Federalists against the State governments ; and no political course adopted by public men or political parties, of which it could be said that it Avas intentionally wrong, has hitherto, to their honor be it spoken, long escaped rebuke from the American people. The Anti-Federal party by their pertinacious, nay morbid perseverance in a wrong course, exposed themselves to the same penalty Avhich Avas at a later period inflicted upon their old opponents \u2014 as a party they were overthroAvn and ruined. The merit of discouraging and finally extinguishing this unnatural, unprofitable, and unnecessary struggle between the friends of the General and State governments, and of vindicating the Federal Constitution, by placing the peculiar principle it sought to establish for the government to be constituted under its authority, that of an imperium in imperio, upon a practicable and safe footing, was reserved for the administration of Thomas Jefferson. For the evils arising from the pernicious rivalry between agencies, upon the harmonious cooperation of which the framers of the Constitution relied for the success of that instrument, the remedy recommended by Mr. Jefferson in his inaugural address, as expressed in his own inimitable language, AA'as \" the support of the State governments in all their rights, as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns, and the surest bulwark against anti-republican"], [403, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 381 tendencies : the preservation of the General Government in its Avhole constitutional vigor, as the sheet-anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad.\" These propositions, so simple, so natural, and so plainly in accord with the spirit of the Constitution, though, in common Avith other suggestions from the same source designed by their author to give repose to an over-agitated community, received at the time with indifference by incensed partisans, met with a cordial welcome from the great body of the people. Their fitness and probable efficacy could not be successfully controverted, and although they did not escape factious opposition, a majority of the people, tired of the unavailing agitation which the subject had undergone, and more and more satisfied of Mr. Jefferson's sincere desire to advance the general interest, embraced them with constantly increasing earnestness, and sustained them until they became the suc cessful as Avell as settled policy of the Government. Angry passions, having their origin in this prolific source of par tisan strife, Avhich SAvept over and convulsed the country during the Government of the Confederation, and for at least twenty years after the adoption of the new Constitu tion, have been subdued. The State governments, increased in number from thirteen to more than thirty, with no other powers than those reserved to them by the undisputed pro visions of the Constitution, have advanced to a degree of dignity and usefulness which has enabled them to extend to their citizens seven eighths of the aid and protection for Avhich they look to government, either State or national, and has also removed from their representatives all fear of the encroachments of the Federal Government; Avhilst the latter, having proven itself able to sustain itself without the aid of constructive powers, and to perform with prompti tude and success all the duties assigned to it, is no longer disturbed by apprehensions of the factious spirit aud"], [404, "382 POLITICAL PARTIES grasping designs once so freely charged upon the State authorities. For this auspicious state of things we are beyond all doubt indebted, more than to any other cause, to the con servative character of Democratic principles and the un- Avavering fidelity of the party that sustains them. To understand truly the advantages which the country has derived from the success of this policy, and the defeat of that to which it Avas opposed, Ave have only to picture to ourselves Avhat the condition of the State gOA'ernments must have been if the latter had triumphed, and to compare it with the actual state of things. Assuming that the desire to divest them of the authority which they had gradually acquired, as occasions for its exercise were developed by the necessities of the public service, at one time so strong Avith leading Federalists and as Ave have seen so openly avowed, had been limited to Avhat Avas actually proposed, viz., to give to the General Government the power to appoint their governors, and through them the most im portant of their minor officers, including those of the militia, with an absolute veto upon all State laws, \u2014 Avhat, judg ing according to the experience Ave have had, would noAV have been the character and condition of those governments ? Without the authority required to make themselves useful, or respectability sufficient to excite the ambition of individ uals to be honorably employed in their service, and thus to divide their attention and regard between the Federal and State governments, they Avould have sunk gradually into feeble, unimportant, characterless establishments \u2014 mere places for the sinecure appointments of the former. Con trast institutions like these \u2014 and only such could have been possible under the policy advocated by the leading Federal ists \u2014 Avith the galaxy of independent governments of Avhich we now boast, such as no confederation, ancient or"], [405, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 383 modern, possessed, A'ested with authority and dignity, and filling the States respectively with monuments of their Avis dom, enterprise, usefulness, and philanthropy; and contrast the Federal Government, resting as it now does on these tried and ample foundations, with one based on establish ments like those to Avhich it was proposed to degrade the States, and Ave will have some idea of the dangers that the people of the United States have escaped, and the advan tages they have secured by the Avisdom of their course and the patriotism of those who advised it. If the Democratic party of Jefferson's time, and under his lead, had effected nothing else for the country, they would have done enough in this to deserve the perpetual respect and gratitude of the Avhole people. Yet this was but the beginning of their usefulness, sub sequent to the adoption of the present Constitution. No sooner had the efforts of the leaders of the Federal party to break down the power and influence of the State governments been arrested through the triumph of the Democratic party in the great contest of 1800, which AA'as to a great extent carried on in their defense, than an attempt Avas set on foot to rescue a portion of the political power lost by the former, by raising the judicial power \u2014 the dispensers of which were to a man on their side \u2014 above the executive and legislative departments of the Federal Government. Of this enterprise, its origin, progress, and present condition, I have taken the notice which I thought Avas demanded by its importance. That it AA'as unsuccess ful, and that the balance of power between those depart ments, so necessary to the security of liberty and to the preservation of the Government, has not been destroyed, is altogether due to the persevering opposition of the Democratic party under the same bold and capable leader. Where the points in issue between political parties have"], [406, "384 POLITICAL PARTIES been of so grave a character as those in the United States, it is not an easy matter to decide on their relative importance, or in Avhich the right and the Avrong Avas most apparent. Whilst some have resolved themselves mainly into questions of expediency, in respect to which errors may be committed Avithout incurable injury to our institutions, there haA'e been others striking at their roots, Avhich would, if differently decided, have ended in their inevitable destruction. The tAvo to which I have referred AA'ere emphatically of the latter character, and hence the inestimable value of the successful resistance that Avas made on the Democratic side. Hamilton's funding system, though involving in respect to the assumption of the State debts a grave constitutional question, Avas in its principal features one of expediency. Yet it was an important one, by reason of the serious consequences that Avere apprehended from its assumed ten dency, and produced impressions upon the public scarcely less marked than were made by any public question which had before or has since arisen in this country. The char acter of that system, and the injuries that were antici pated from its establishment, have been spoken of in a previous part of this essay. Only a slight consideration of the operations of a similar system elsewhere will be sufficient to show how greatly the Avelfare of nations has been affected by their course in respect to it. Of these, England, from her present condition in regard to her public debt, compared Avith that in which it is believed she might have stood if her course in that respect had been guided by wiser counsels, presents the most in structive example. Ours derives interest scarcely less impressive from the evils we have avoided by abandoning, Avhilst that Avas yet in our poAver, the further imitation of her example after we had fully begun to imitate it. That the system Avas established here with much eclat, and under"], [407, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 385 explanations and circumstances indicative of a determination on the part of the men in power to adhere to it as long as and Avhenever a public debt existed, all know. It is also known that the practice of funding the public debt, for which it furnished the plan, has long been discontinued. Through what agency and upon what inducements that discontinuance has been brought about, and Avho is en titled to the credit of protecting the country from the evils flowing from the practice elsewhere, can only be ascertained by an impartial examination of its further history. To bestow that attention upon the subject is per haps not necessary for instruction or example, as a national bank has not become more completely an \" obsolete idea \" amongst us, or more thoroughly condemned in public opinion than a funding system. Still there are many con siderations Avhich render such an examination an object of curiosity certainly, and one not destitute of higher interest. If the change Avhich Avas effected in the policy and action of the Government in this regard has been as advantageous as Avith the light which experience has thrown upon the subject cannot be longer doubted, it is highly proper that those avIio brought about the reform should have the credit of it. No important transaction upon AA'hich patriotism of such an order and intellects of such caliber as distinguished the public men of that day were earnestly employed, can be Avithout interest to inquiring minds of this. It is so long since the Avhole affair has passed from public attention as to make it an unfamiliar subject to most of us. I confess it Avas so to me, and those who read these sheets will not complain if the interest I have taken in folloAA'ing it to its termination shall at least save them from some of the trouble that would otherwise have been necessary to master its details. 25"], [408, "386 POLITICAL PARTIES Strongly excited by the first appearance of the project at the head of Hamilton's programme, as Avell described by Madison in his interesting statement to Mr. Trist, the old Republicans in and out of Congress, with Jefferson as their adviser and at their head, rallied promptly in earnest and unyielding opposition to its consummation. Overborne by a large majority in the first Congress, de voted as it was to Hamilton and his measures, they could not defeat the bill for its establishment, and Avere obliged to content themselves in the first instance with efforts to expose its objectionable features to the people, in the hope of rendering it too odious to be persisted in. They also resorted, as they often afterwards did on similar occasions, to the State legislatures for advice and cooperation. That of Virginia, the President's native State, as Avell as the place of his residence, denounced the scheme very soon after its introduction, in resolutions of much poAver, touch ing the subject upon the points in respect to which it Avas most exceptionable. Its opponents in Congress also kept a watchful eye upon the steps taken by the Secretary towards its execution, and followed every important movement by calls for information and by pertinent resolutions. These calls Avere generally upon the Secretary, occasionally on the President himself. As early as 1792, the Republicans caused the introduction of, and gave efficient support to, a resolution that \" measures ought to be taken for the re demption of so much of the public debt as by the act making provision for the debts of the United States, they have the right to redeem.\" In this resolution, which was adopted by the House, a provision was inserted, against the votes of the old Republicans, to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare the plan for the contemplated redemption. Those Avho were opposed to its preparation by that officer desired to have it done by a committee, and"], [409, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 387 apprehended obstacles on his part to an efficient prosecu tion of the reform they supported. The resolution, though not expressly such in its terms, was obviously designed as a side-blow at the funding sys tem. That the Secretary so regarded it was sufficiently apparent from the graceful notice, in his report, of the cir cumstance that \"the House had predetermined the question in regard to the expediency of the proposed redemption, and only submitted to his consideration the best mode of carrying it into effect.\" He then proceeded to state the different ways in which the object in vieAV might be accom plished, designated that which he thought most expedient, pointed out the increased burdens on the people it Avould require, and specified the taxes the imposition of Avhich he thought would be necessary. His report Avas drawn up with his accustomed skill and ability, but the measure was no further prosecuted at that time. The President Avas subsequently called upon, at the instance of the Republicans, for copies of the commissions and instructions under which Hamilton had borrowed some twelve millions of dollars in Europe in virtue of a pro vision of the act establishing the funding system, and a call was at the same time made upon Hamilton for an account of the manner in which the money had been ap plied. These calls brought from the President copies of the commission and instructions, the latter of Avhich Avere very precise and in strict conformity, in every respect, to the law, and from Hamilton an elaborate report, drawn with a degree of care and power unusual even with him. He appears to have anticipated a storm, and to have pre pared himself for every contingency, as far as his conduct could be sustained by the facts. Those who derive pleasure from the intellectual efforts of great minds, however re mote the occasion that called them forth, will not begrudge the time spent in reading his report."], [410, "388 POLITICAL PARTIES A series of resolutions introduced into the House by Giles of Virginia, charged the Secretary Avith having violated both the law and the President's instructions, by the manner in which he had executed the authority con fided to him. These resolutions, after a long and ani mated debate, were thrown out by strong votes, of the composition of which Mr. Jefferson undertakes to give an account in his annals. But no unprejudiced mind can read Madison's unanswerable speech, which will be found in the first volume of \" Benton's Abridgment of the Debates of Congress,\" p. 431, Avithout being convinced that the truth of both charges Avas established. He proves by the Secretary's own letters that on the very day of the receipt of the President's instructions he commenced arrangements, which he, notAvithstanding, carried into effect, for an application of the funds diametrically oppo site to that which the President had directed him to make. Mr. Randall, in his \" Life of Thomas Jefferson,\" 1 has accidentally fallen into a singular mistake in saying that \"Mr. Madison voted Avith the majority on every division \" on that occasion, and on that assumption proceeds to show \" that Jefferson put a less charitable construction on the motives of the majority,\" by giving the folloAving entry in his \" Ana \" : \" March the 2d, 1793.

Other circumstances may be referred to Avhich show quite clearly that the latter was not at ease upon the subject of the finances. Among these is one of a very striking character, not known at the time, and only recently disclosed through the publication of the \" Hamilton Pa pers \" by order of Congress. I allude to the correspond ence between him and Washington, to Avhich I have before referred for another purpose, and which will be found in the fourth volume of \" Hamilton's Works,\" commencing at page 510. The committee appointed by Congress to"], [412, "390 POLITICAL PARTIES examine the state of the treasury preparatory to Hamil ton's resignation, then expected but postponed for a season, were charged by that body to \" inquire into the authorities, from the President to the Secretary of the Treasury, re specting the making and disbursing of the loans \" Avhich were the subject of the debate and proceedings above referred to. Hamilton thought the inquiry beyond the province of the committee, but wishing to be prepared, if they should decide otherwise, furnished the President Avith a statement of the facts, as he understood them to be, Avith a view to his approval. Washington indorsed on it a cer tificate which was very unsatisfactory to Hamilton, who thereupon addressed to him a long and earnest letter, in which he complained vehemently, and Avith the frankness and boldness natural to him, of not having been sustained by the President in a delicate and responsible part of his official duties in respect to the public debt. It does not appear that Washington made any reply to this extraordi nary letter, or that he did anything further upon the sub ject which had called it forth. Whilst the proceedings which led to the debate of which I have spoken were going on, a bill was introduced on the recommendation of the Secretary, for a second assumption of State debts, and authorizing a loan to be opened for that purpose. Notwithstanding strenuous efforts on the part of the Republican members to prevent its passage, the bill passed the House, but only by the casting vote of Mr. Speaker Trumbull. These circumstances were brought to the notice of the President by Jefferson, before the bill was acted upon by the Senate, and it Avas rejected by that body. He speaks in his \"Ana \" of the prevalent impres sion that the bill had been defeated by the interference of the President, through Lear, with Langdon, who till that time had gone steadily for the funding system but iioav"], [413, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 391 opposed its extension. Jefferson says, \" Beckley knoAvs this.\" But Avhatever may have been the state of feeling be tween these great men, arising out of the condition of the finances, or the course of the Secretary in respect to them, we have the best reasons for believing that there Avas a groAving sentiment in the Federal party adverse to the ex pediency of keeping on foot the funding system. It soon began to lose the brilliant hues in which it had been clothed, at its first introduction, by the very imposing report of the Secretary. Our foreign creditors showed an unwillingness to subject their debts to its operation, and the means taken to find subjects to be embraced by its provisions could not fail to excite odium against the meas ure. The people were not a little predisposed to listen favorably to the charges that were made against it on the part of the Republicans, by the circumstances heretofore noticed that it was so close an imitation of the English system, and adopted upon the heel of the Revolution. The growing jealousy of the people, and consequent increase of public clamor against it, caused a Avide-spread conviction through the Federal ranks that the entire success of the Republican party could only be prevented by its abandon ment, \u2014 a conviction greatly strengthened and stimulated to action by the startling fact that, although the President had just been reflected by the unanimous vote of the people, the country was convulsed by partisan rancors, for which there was no other apology than the measures of his administration, and the Confederacy which he came into power to cement was in imminent peril of disrup tion by their violence. Neither Avas this the Avorst nor the most humiliating view of the case. For the first time during our existence as an independent nation, even in cluding the period of the proverbially weak government of"], [414, "392 POLITICAL PARTIES the Confederation, our free institutions suffered the discredit of an open rebellion against the authority of the Federal Government springing up in the Quaker State, one of the oldest and best settled in the Confederacy and in Avhich was established the seat of that Government, against the imposition of a tax always and everywhere odious, an \" infernal tax,\" as Jefferson called it ; \u2014 an insurrection of so much importance as to induce Washington to call into the field a force numerically larger than Avas ever concen trated at one place during the War of the Revolution, or ever organized in one body in the course of two Avars through Avhich the country has since passed, and nearly if not quite double that Avith which Scott fought his way through a hostile nation of eight millions, and entered the City of Mexico in triumph. No feature in the character of Washington has ever been disclosed A\\'hich will allow us to believe for a moment that those scenes could have failed to disturb and agitate deeply his lofty and sensitive spirit. We have a fact, noAV for the first time, as far as I know or believe, revealed in Randall's \" Life of Jefferson,\" which gives us some clue to the current of Washington's thoughts at that very critical period of his life. Hamilton, whose resignation was about to take effect, applied to have the time prolonged until after the impending insurrection had been suppressed, on the ground that as it Avas menaced in consequence of a measure of his Department, it Avould not be proper for him to leave his post until the crisis had ter minated, and he had also asked for leave to attend the troops to the scene of the outbreak. Both of these appli cations had been readily agreed to by the President. In the midst of these movements, between the first Proclama tion offering pardon to the rebels upon their return to duty and the second calling the troops into the field and an nouncing the intended application of military force, an"], [415, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 393 express was sent to Mr. Jefferson Avith an invitation to him to resume his former place in Washington's cabinet. This fact is indisputable, for Jefferson's answer declining the in vitation is published by Randall. What was the nature and Avhat the extent of Washing ton's design in this application X The assumption is justi fied by the lapse of time and by other circumstances, that as no record of his intentions has come to light none ex ists, and it is therefore a question on which we are only able to speculate; but there is another question, the answer to which, though not quite certain, may be made so, and which, when ascertained, would throw much light upon the subject of our speculations. Was Hamilton advised of the application to Jefferson, and was it made Avith his approbation ? The thorough examinations and publications which have been made of the papers of both Washington and Hamilton, Avithout the dis closure of a single reference to the main fact, authorize the belief that Hamilton never was a party to the movement in any shape. In respect to Hamilton's papers, this inference is particularly strong, as, from the quasi-rivalry Avhich has recently been set on foot by his descendants between his own fame and that of Washington, it may Avell be pre sumed that if they could haA'e furnished evidence of such an act of disloyalty to Federalism on the part of Washing ton as his invitation to Jefferson, who had, after his retire ment, openly charged Congress with the most flagrant corruption, and traced its origin to the measures of the Secretary of the Treasury, the information would certainly not have been withheld from publication. The same con siderations lead Avith still greater confidence to the conclu sion that no movement had been made towards any other than a temporary change of purpose in regard to his resig nation on the part of Hamilton. Washington's letter giving"], [416, "394 POLITICAL PARTIES his consent to the postponement, is published among the \" Hamilton Papers,\" and from all that was said or done upon the subject it is quite clear that no attempt was made by him to dissuade Hamilton from carrying his resolution into effect, and that such resolution was final on the part of the latter from the beginning. Incidents occurring at an early period of their rela tions were well calculated to induce circumspection in such a matter on both sides. The uncertainty in regard to Washington's ulterior intentions in the step he had just taken will become more apparent the more the question is considered. Mr. Randall seems to infer from it a desire on his part to return to the system of a balanced govern ment with Avhich he commenced his administration. But to the consummation of such a design the assent of Ham ilton was absolutely indispensable, and that, Avith the lights before us, we may safely assume Avas neither asked nor given. I find it, besides, difficult to resist the conclusion that Washington's preference for that sort of government must by that time have been greatly weakened if not en tirely extinguished. He had tried it under circumstances far more eligible than those then existing or than he could reasonably anticipate, and had found it disastrous. Jefferson had in the most positive terms declined an attempt to coalesce with Hamilton, as made impossible by the radi cal differences in their political principles. The same dif ferences continued, and their personal relations had now become much more embittered. For these and other rea sons that could be given, it is extremely difficult to recon cile Avith his Avell-known prudence the design hypothetically attributed to Washington by Randall. If there is the force in these suggestions that they appear to me to possess, we would seem to be driven to the conclusion that Washington contemplated, in military"], [417, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 395 language, a change of front dependent upon Jefferson's acceptance ; that he meant not only to place Jefferson at the head of his cabinet, but to give an increased effect to his principles in the future administration of the Govern ment. I confess that this is a startling supposition, even to my own mind, and one in respect to which I feel that I cannot go much beyond surmise. A step of so decided and so pregnant a character, taken under the pressure of a situation for many reasons so critical, could not have been thought of by such a man as Washington Avithout ulterior, well-considered designs. What were they, if not of the character I have suggested X I can conceive of no other answer to this question which is not more inconsistent with well-knoAvn facts. Considerations were not wanting to persuade him that his second term, under an administration thus directed, would be more agreeable as well as more auspicious for the country than the first had been. I have before referred to the contrast between Jefferson and Madison on one side, and Hamilton on the other, presented by the fact that whilst the former entered upon the discharge of public offices with feelings and views similar to those with which they accepted private trusts, considered themselves under equal obligations to respect the rights and to carry into full and fair effect the intentions of the parties chiefly con cerned, and would have regarded a failure to do either as much a violation of the principles of probity and honor in one case as in the other, the latter neither entertained nor professed to act upon such opinions ; he had on the con trary a conviction, Avhich he never changed, that there Avere deficiencies in the popular mind Avhich made it impractica ble on the part of men in power to deal safely AA'ith the people by appeals to their good sense and honesty, and that, they could only be successfully governed through their"], [418, "396 POLITICAL PARTIES fears or their interests. Hence his justification of meas ures addressed to their passions and particular interests, and hence his indifference to the faithful observance of the Constitution as a moral or honorable obligation and his utter recklessness of constitutional restraints in his public career, notwithstanding the perfect uprightness of his deal ings in private life. Washington's personal character has been never correctly appreciated, if the former of these systems or ideas was not more congenial with his taste and Avith the suggestions of his heart than the latter. In giving his assent to the bill for the establishment of the bank, he could not shut his eyes to the fact that he Avas sanctioning a measure which he had conclusive reason to believe Avas neA'er intended to be au thorized by the Constitution, framed by a convention over which he had presided. Reasons of supposed state ne cessity we are Avarranted in believing reconciled his con science to the step, but it cannot be doubted, Avithout injustice to his character, that it was a hard service aud altogether repugnant to his feelings. His inquietude under these restraints upon his natural inclinations was exhibited on more than one occasion. His letter to the venerable Ed- mund Pendleton, (one of the purest of men,) published by Randall, Avas one of them. That rumors AArere rife in respect to the measures decided upon by Federal cabals if Washington had refused to sign the Bank Bill AA'e learn from several sources, and no one who kneAv Mr. Madison can doubt that he spoke with full knoAvledge when he said to Trist as already quoted, that if the President had vetoed the Bill \" there tvould have been an effort to nullify it '' (the veto), \" and they \" (the leading Federalists) \" would have arrayed themselves in a hostile attitude.\" It is, besides, against nature to suppose that Washington's con sciousness of the past condition of things in this regard and"], [419, "LN THE UNITED STATES. 397 recollection of the scenes referred to by Madison, had not been painfully revived by the offensive letter he had received from Hamilton only four months before the period of Avhich we are speaking. The probable correctness of the inference under consider ation ought not to be tested by the character of the subse quent relations betAveen Washington and Hamilton. Jeffer son declined the President's invitation to resume his former seat in his cabinet promptly but respectfully and kindly. Mr. Randall says that he has read a declaration by Presi dent Washington to the effect that he Avould have offered the place to Madison, upon Jefferson's declension, if he had not ascertained that he Avould not accept it. These successive and marked steps by the most prominent leaders of the Republican party, taken in connection Avith the results of the preceding Congressional elections, and the avowed principles upon Avhich they had been conducted, show clearly that the lines had been distinctly and finally draAvn between the Republicans who had hitherto sustained the administration in general and the Federal party ; the opinion at which Jefferson and the Republicans had arriA-ed being that the differences which had arisen, founded as they chiefly Avere on the interpretation of the Constitution and the degree of sanctity attaching to that instrument, could not be satisfactorily settled by any divided counsels, or by any the most liberal and friendly dispositions of the President ; that the season for obtaining present redress and future security upon those points through such means had passed away, and that their proper course, whilst continuing their respect for and their confidence in Washington to the end, Avas to support the measures of his administration as far as they could consistently with their avowed principles, and to place the Government in the hands of men of their own school at the earliest practicable moment after his voluntary retirement."], [420, "398 POLITICAL PARTIES The President, having greatly against his inclination consented to stand by the helm for another term, and having been reflected by the unanimous vote of the country, had no other course to pursue than to carry on the Government under its existing organization, relying for his support upon the Federal party, with such cooperation as his measures might draw from its opponents. Hamilton resigned at the end of the quarter, his resignation was ac- cepted in the way I have described, and as the actual and acknoAvledged leader of the Federal party, though out of office, he kept up his relations with Washington's admin- istration as Avell as with that of his successor, Mr. Adams, as has been already set forth. The administration having been virtually, and, in the English sense, actually over- throAvn by being reduced to a minority in the popular branch of the national legislature, the President, having signally failed in his disinterested and patriotic attempt to arrest the adverse current by a reconstruction of his cabinet so as to place at its head the knoAvn and acknowledged leader of the opposition to the principal measures of the Government, and obliged by his reelection to remain at his post till the expiration of his second term or to retire with discredit, turned his attention to an earnest survey of the policy to Avhich so disastrous a state of things might be attributed. That it had not originated in any objections personal to himself Avas shown by the fact that the same election which exhibited the evidence of dissatisfaction, on the part of a majority of the people, Avith the measures of Government, demonstrated also by his unanimous re election their continued confidence in him. Those measures to Avhich the deprecated result Avas attributed were the bank and the funding system. Jay's treaty had no agency in producing it, that disturbing question not having then arisen, and its only effect, in this respect, was during the"], [421, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 399 last year of Washington's administration to increase the majority against the Government to so great an extent as to enable the Republicans to carry Kitchel's resolution condemnatory of the President's own act in refusing to lay before Congress the instructions and papers connected with the negotiation of the treaty, by a vote, including absentees whose sentiments were known, of very nearly two to one. The bank, to the operations of which Jefferson, Avhilst in retirement, openly and unreservedly attributed the cor ruption of Congress, had passed beyond reach, but the funding system was yet open to the action of the Govern ment. It AA-as in respect to this ill-omened and ill-fated measure that the tocsin had been first sounded of that alarm which now extensively pervaded the public mind, and it was beyond all doubt that no other act of the Government had proven a more prolific source of popular discontent. It Avas not the existence of the debt of Avhich the people complained ; they gladly accepted that burden, on the contrary, as the price of their liberties ; but it was the system devised by Hamilton for its management and for the treatment of their fiscal affairs generally that excited their severe displeasure.. They believed that the politico fiscal agencies congenial Avith, and cherished features of, monarchical institutions had been adopted in servile emu lation of the English system, and as they Avere acknowl edged sources of corruption in that system, that they had been introduced for similar effect here. Hamilton's oft avowed preference for the English model gave much color to the first, part of this conclusion, and the exasperated feelings of our people toAA'ard that government predisposed the public mind against the Avhole policy. Nor were these resentments Avithout adequate cause. No independent nation was ever worse treated by another than was ours"], [422, "400 POLITICAL PARTIES by Great Britain from the recognition of our Independence until after the war of 1812. So arrogant and outrageous was her conduct at this very period that Washington, as appears by his published letters to Hamilton in August 1796, found it difficult to keep the expressions of his dis satisfaction within the bounds demanded by his official position, and Hamilton AA'as driven to admit in his reply that \" Ave Avere subject to inconveniences too nearly ap proaching- a state of Avar \" to be submitted to. But these Avere not the only nor eA'en the principal objections of the people against the funding system. They Avere satisfied by reason and observation that there could never be a proper economy in public expenditures, or a check to the increase of public debt so long as Government Avas not only under no obligation to pay the principal of such debts but had no right so to do or the right only in respect to a mere pittance, as was the case Avith our funded debt. The poAA'er to coin'ert the credit of the nation into revenue by such a policy, of Avhich Hamilton boasted, Avas a power in Avhich they thought no government could be safely indulged. If the argument in favor of that opinion, Avhich need not be repeated here, was not sufficient to establish its soundness, the experience of the mother country, Avhich was constantly before their eyes, afforded conclusive dem onstration of it. I have elseAvhere stated the extent to Avhich the debt of England had then already increased, and the force with which her ablest Avriter on political economy and finance had traced that alarming groAvth, by the lights of experience and reason, to those features in her funding system. Hamilton had been throughout and still remained de voted to Avhat we may call English principles in the man agement of our finances, and constantly desirous to extend them to every species of our public debt, foreign and do-"], [423, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 401 mestic. General Washington was wedded to no such vieAvs. The subject belonging peculiarly to Hamilton's department, and having full confidence in him, he acqui esced in the course he recommended, but he Avas always open to conviction, and only wished to leave the question of its continuance to be decided by its results. In the course of a conversation with Mr. Jefferson, designed to prevail on him to remain in the cabinet, the latter says that Washington touched upon the merits of the funding system, to which he knew that Mr. Jefferson Avas ear nestly opposed, aud expressed himself thus: \"There is a difference of opinion about it, some thinking it A'ery bad, and others very good ; experience AA-as the only criterion of right which he knew, and this alone would decide which opinion was right.\" The disappointment generally experi enced by the original friends of the system cannot have failed to reach Washington, and it is impossible that the discredit Avhich the measure had brought upon his admin istration could have escaped the notice of so sagacious and generally dispassionate an observer of the course of events. Hamilton was to leave him in a month or two, and he Avas destined to pass through an ordeal becoming every day more and more severe. To relieve his Government as far as practicable from odium from any source, was therefore a suggestion of duty and interest to which he could not but give heed. The measure of Avhich Ave are speaking chal lenged his attention. The power of the Government over it. without the consent of its creditors, Avas, it is true, very limited, but it could relieve the system to some extent of a portion of its unpopularity by lessening its character of irredeemability. The annual eight per cent, for interest and principal (only two per cent, towards the principal, which Avas all the Government had a right to pay, but Avas never obliged to pay), it could make itself liable to redeem 20"], [424, "402 POLITICAL PARTIES punctually, and could give to the creditors securities which would put it out of its power to evade its undertaking. This Avas all that could be done, and it was not to be doubted that the accomplishment of this through the inter ference of Washington, with a return to the old mode of raising money, aa-ouIi! go far to allay honest apprehensions, and to remove prejudices against his administration Avith out disadvantage to the public service certainly, and, I may add, without the slightest departure from the course Avhich it became him to pursue. He determined to pursue it. That the resolution in regard to the policy finally adopted upon this point originated with Washington alone, Avithout consultation Avith, or advice from, Hamilton, is rendered certain to my mind from contemporaneous circumstances, some of Avhich will be referred to. He, of course, com municated his intention to Hamilton, Avho proposed to take charge of all the preliminary steps that could be adopted during the short period of his remaining in office to pre pare the Avay for the contemplated change. This was proper in itself and assented to by the President, Avho thus, as was his AA'ay on most occasions, enabled Hamilton to give to the Avhole affair the shape he thought best. The funding system was emphatically his measure, and if it was to be discontinued, it Avas proper that he should be permitted to make its exit as graceful as was practicable. The intended movement was preceded by the President's speech to Congress in November, 1794, from Avhich I ex tract this passage : \" The time which has elapsed since the commencement of our fiscal measures has developed our pecuniary resources so as to open a way for a definitive plan for the redemption of the public debt. It is believed that the result is such as to encourage Congress to consum mate this work without delay. Nothing can more promote the permanent welfare of the nation, and nothing Avould"], [425, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 403 be more grateful to our constituents. Indeed, whatsoever is unfinished of our system of public credit cannot be ben efited by procrastination ; and, as far as may be practica ble, Ave ought to place that credit on grounds which cannot be disturbed, and to prevent that progressive accumulation of debt Avhich must ultimately endanger all governments.\" This was substantially the only part of the speech Avhich related to any other matter than the Pennsylvanian insur rection, and no one familiar Avith Hamilton's writings can doubt that the entire paragraph Avas prepared by him, \u2014 a proceeding common and in this instance particularly proper. It presented in general terms a gratifying assurance of the improvement in the revenues of the Government, and the promised advantages to the national finances. No refer ence is made to the character of the measures by Avhich those advantages were to be secured ; these might be pro visions for the immediate reduction of the debt, or at the least for an earlier reduction than that which Avas author- ized by laAv. On the 25th of January, eleven days before he left the department, Hamilton tendered to the Senate an elabo rate \" plan for the further support of public credit on the basis of the actual revenue.\" It Avas not his annual report, nor had it been called for by the Senate, but had been pre pared, he said, as a part of his duties, according to the Act by Avhich they Avere prescribed, and in conformity with the suggestions of the President. It fills twenty-seven pages, small print, in the large folio edition of the American State Papers, and, being his last, was of course prepared with great care and, as much of course, Avith great ability. Jefferson thought, at times, that Hamilton did not himself understand his own complicated and elaborate reports on the finances, but in this I am persuaded he Avas entirely mistaken. Hamilton evidently held the thousand threads"], [426, "404 POLITICAL PARTIES which traversed these voluminous AA'orks Avith a firm and instructed hand, and perfectly understood their several and manifold connections Avith the body of the documents and the results to which the whole and every part tended. That he meant that others should understand them as Avell as he did is perhaps not so certain. His plan did not even look to a present reduction of the debt, Avhich would seem to be the natural consequence of a revenue so prosperous as that he had described in the speech ; that would have been an impossibility. At the date of his report the debt had increased four millions from Avhat it Avas Avhen the funding system was estab lished, independent of the assumption of those of the States, and at the end of Mr. Adams's administration, the increase stood at eight millions. I have not examined the result for each year, but am confident that I hazard little in affirming that there was not a single year, from the first period to the last, during Avhich the public debt Avas not increased. Mr. Jefferson, in a letter to Mr. Madison, written in 1796, expressed the opinion that, from the com mencement of the new government till the time Avhen he ceased to attend to it, the debt had augmented a million a year. The preceding statement shows the correctness of his calculation. Neither did Hamilton propose any measures by Avhich the payment of the debt might be accelerated, but the reverse. The whole debt then stood as follows : foreign debt, betAveen thirteen and fourteen millions ; domestic debt funded, including those of the States, between sixty and sixty-one millions, and domestic debt unsubscribed, be tween one and two millions. The foreign debt was paya ble by installments, ending at the expiration of fifteen years. His plan Avas to offer the foreign creditors one half of one per cent, interest, annually, more than it then drew, if they"], [427, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 405 would consent to make it a domestic debt, and postpone the redemption of the principal till 1818, which would defer it between eight and nine years ; or, if they refused that, it might remain redeemable at any time they pro posed, so that the redemption of the principal was not accelerated by making it less than the fifteen years. A laAv authorizing such a change Avas passed, the offer made and declined. The debt Avas suffered to stand as it did, and the last payment Avas made during the administration of Mr. Madison. In respect to the funded debt, all that the report proposed (and that proposition Avas carried into effect by law shortly after Hamilton retired) Avas to add materially to the existing provisions for the payment of the public debt, and to provide effectually that the funds set apart for that should be regularly and inviolably applied, first, to the payment of as much of the funded debt as the Government had a right to pay annually, which was two per cent, of the principal besides the interest, and after that to the then existing public debt generally ; that is to say, in regard to the funded debt, it changed the option of the Government to pay the two per cent, into a positive obligation, and provided adequate funds for that purpose. It Avas calculated that these provisions AA'ould redeem the funded debt bearing an immediate interest in 1818, and the deferred funded debt in 1824; they did so, and thus the funded debt Avas extinguished. All succeeding loans, as Avell under the administrations of Washington and Adams as subsequently, were made redeemable at or after a certain period, save in rare and very limited instances controlled by special circumstances and not constituting modifications of the general rule of the Government. By this step Congress carried into effect an object for Avhich the Republicans had striven since soon after the establishment of the funding system, and upon the resolu-"], [428, "406 POLITICAL PARTIES tion to accomplish Avhich Hamilton had interposed a tem porary obstruction by his report in December, 1792. The funded debt was changed into a simple debt payable by regular though small installments, at stated and certain pe riods. Its ultimate redemption Avas made certain, and the further practice of funding successfully discountenanced. That was done which Washington desired to have done ; not indeed in the plain, straightforward way in which he would have done it, for that Avould have shown that the Government, in deference to public sentiment, had, to bor row a common phrase, taken the back track ; an exhibition which Hamilton's course was designed to avoid. What the latter undertook to do he did effectually and in good faith, but a careful perusal of his last expose will show Iioav little the whole proceeding was in harmony with his indi vidual feelings. The followiug are extracts from that extraordinary paper : \u2014 \" To extinguish a debt which exists and to avoid the contracting more are always ideas favored by public feel ing ; but to pay taxes for the one or the other purpose, which are the only means of preventing the evil, is always more or less unpopular. These contradictions are in hu man nature ; and happy indeed Avould be the country that should ever want men to turn them to the account of their own popularity or to some other sinister account. \" Hence it is no uncommon spectacle to see the same men clamoring for occasions of expense when they happen to be in unison Avith the present humor of the community, whether well or ill directed, declaiming against a public debt and for the reduction of it as an abstract thesis, yet vehe ment against every plan of taxation which is proposed to discharge old debts or to avoid neAv by the defraying of exigencies as they emerge. These unhandsome acts throw"], [429, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 407 artificial embarrassments in the way of the administration of a go\\'ernment.\" These observations afford evidence of the Avounded spirit under which he was acting, and also of the strong sense he entertained of the influence which a necessity for taxa tion is calculated to exert upon the minds of a legislature anxious for the redemption of a public debt. Do they not further explain the motive for the array of taxes that would be required to carry into effect the Resolution of 1792, in favor of making provision for the redemption of the funded debt, contained in his report upon that resolu tion \"? When speaking of now resorting to the old practice of anticipating revenues, that is, by making provision for the payment of both principal and interest, in the departure from Avhich practice the English Funding System had its birth, he says : \u2014 \" This would be at the same time an antidote against what may be pronounced the most plausible objections to the system of funding public debts ; which are, that, by facilitating the means of supporting expense they encourage to enterprises Avhich produce it, and by furnishing in credit a substitute for revenue, likely to be too freely used to avoid the odium of laying new taxes, they occasion a tendency to run in debt. Though these objections to fund ing systems \u2014 Avhich, giving the greatest possible energy to public credit, are a great source of national security, strength, and prosperity \u2014 are very similar to those which speculatiA'e men urge against national and individual opu lence, draAvn from its abuses ; and though perhaps, upon a careful analysis of facts, they Avould be found to have much less support in them than is imagined, attributing to those systems effects which are to be ascribed, more truly, to the passions of men and perhaps to the genius of particular"], [430, "408 POLITICAL PARTIES governments ; yet, as they are not wholly unfounded, it is desirable to guard, as far as possible, against the dangers which they suppose, Avithout renouncing the advantages which these systems undoubtedly afford.\" When we find him thus dallying Avith a pet system on the eve of its abandonment, thus filling a paper designed to prepare the AA'ay for that result Avith his reasons for deprecating it, who can suppose that its impending fate Avas of his OAvn suggestion, or doubt that he looked to its restoration under more favorable auspices ? The Secretary very naturally endeavors in this paper to place the provisions now recommended in respect to the Sinking Fund upon the same footing with those contained in his first Report upon public credit, conformably to which his funding system AA'as established. Without the slightest desire to assail or to weaken any of his attempts to rest his acts on the most favorable ground consistent with truth, it is yet due to the memories of the patriotic men who by their fearless and persevering efforts succeeded in discrediting that dangerous system, and finally in causing it to be discontinued from the operations of our Government, that the circumstances under which they acted should not be misrepresented. The difference between the provisions of the Sinking Fund first and now adopted Avas great indeed. The grant of the funds to the first, to say nothing of their insufficiency, lacked the essential quality of being irrevocable, but Avas left subject to the action of Congress. There was therefore no reason to think that more might be ex pected from the Sinking Fund here than had been realized in England, Avhere it had not only been found entirely ineffectual even in time of peace, but the funds vested in the Commissioners had on more than one occasion been used as a basis for new loans. But now, when the business of redemption Avas entered upon in earnest, that matter"], [431, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 409 was placed upon a very different footing. The funds were not only more ample, but they Avere vested in the Commis sioners as an irrevocable trust, and the faith of the Govern ment Avas pledged that its execution should not be interfered with. As widely different Avere the dispositions of the Government and the sentiments of its principal supporters. On the former occasion the proposals submitted to Congress by the head of the Treasury Department, and most trusted officer of the Government, were to fund the entire debt of the United States upon the following terms, viz: 1st. That the Avhole principal should be forever irredeemable at the option of the United States ; 2d. That they should not even reserve to themselves a right to pay more than two dollars upon a hundred of the principal, however full their coffers, and however great their convenience to pay ; and, that no obstacle might be Avanting to the redemption of that pittance, he proposed further to assume and fund in the same Avay tAventy-five millions of the debts of the States which the Federal Government Avas under no obligations to pay and was not asked to assume. This policy was entered upon in the face of the fact that the debt of Eng land, under a similar system, had, in eighty years, in creased from some five millions to two hundred and seventy-six millions of pounds sterling, and was still increasing. After these propositions had been substantially adopted by Congress and sustained by the Government, Hamilton, having the entire direction of its affairs, and knowing the spirit and firmness with Avhich those who disapproved of his schemes always maintained their views of the public interest, had no right to complain of, and ought not to have been surprised at, the opposition he encountered from them, under the Aveight of Avhich his Funding System, in respect to the future action of the Government in the management"], [432, "410 POLITICAL PARTIES of its finances, soon became a dead letter, no further thought of than to get rid of the debts that had been contracted under it, with the intent to return to the old mode of anticipating revenue, that of direct loans payable at or after specific periods, principal as Avell as interest ; the only Avay by which, as Adam Smith had demonstrated, a nation could aA'oid a permanent and ruinous public debt, \u2014 a vieAV of the subject Avhich came too late for England, but Avas, happily, in season for us. Though the Government had, by the Act of March 3d, 1795, passed to carry into effect the improved views of Washington, placed the management of our finances upon a better foot ing, no progress was made in the reduction of the public debt ; but the act doubtless accomplished much in restrain ing its increase. It was not an easy thing to keep doAA'n the public debt under an administration which, like that of Mr. Adams, in pursuance of the express advice of Hamil ton to Wolcott, paid upon its loans an annual interest of eight per cent., the highest that had then ever been paid except by England to her bank upon the loan obtained from it on its first establishment. Upon Jefferson's accession to power he denounced a public debt, in his message to Congress, as a \" moral canker,\" and invoked the aid of the legislature for its extinction at the earliest practicable period. The Committee of Ways and Means, with John Randolph at its head (his brightest period of public usefulness), entered upon the subject \" con amove.\" They called upon the Secretary of the Treasury for a thorough exposition of the state of the public debt, and for his opinion in regard to the best mode of dealing with it. Mr. Gallatin's reply, which may be found in the publication of American State Papers, \u2014 title \" Finance,\" Vol. I., \u2014 gave a full statement of the then condition of the debt, and pointed out the defects through"], [433, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 411 which the Act of March 3, 1795, had been rendered in adequate to the accomplishment of all the objects for Avhich it was designed. I will refer to but one of them, Avhich consisted in its limiting the appropriation for the redemption of the public debt, beyond that Avhich had been funded, to \"surpluses Avhich shall remain at the end of every calendar year, and which, during the session of Congress next there after, shall not be otherwise specially appropriated or re served by laAv.\" Our experience of the action of Congress has been too full to make it necessary to speak of the ex treme improbability of any considerable surpluses being left by that body acting under no more specific restraint than that which is here provided, and upon examination of the books of the treasury it was found that so far from there having been any such surpluses from the establishment of the present Government in 1789 till the close of the year 1799, the appropriations charged upon the revenue by Congress had exceeded, by nearly a million of dollars, the Avhole amount of such revenue, Avhether collected or outstanding. To remedy results so unfavorable to the accomplishment of the object in view, the Secretary advised specific appro priations of such sums as, upon a fair estimate of the wants and resources of the country, ought in the opinion of Congress to be applied to the payment of the public debt, and to make such appropriations irrevocable and their ap plication mandatory on the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund. The committee adopted the suggestion Avith alacrity as one which, in addition to securing the early performance of a sacred duty, could not in their opinion fail to induce economy on the part of Congress in its disposition of the public funds. They therefore reported a bill, Avhich be came a laAv, appropriating annually to the Sinking Fund seven millions three hundred thousand dollars for the pay-"], [434, "412 POLITICAL PARTIES ment of the public debt. This sum Avas increased to eight millions in consequence of the purchase of Louisiana. During the administration of Mr. Madison the annual ap propriation was increased to ten millions, besides an addi tional appropriation of nine millions, and one of four millions if the Secretary of the Treasury should deem it expedient ; and all of these appropriations Avere made irrevocable and compulsory as respected the action of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund. The consequences of this change in the action of the Government upon the subject of the public debt and of this liberality of appropriations under Democratic adminis trations, were the discharge of thirty-three millions of the principal of the debt, besides the payment of interest on the Avhole, during the Presidency of Mr. Jefferson, and its final extinguishment under President Jackson, notwithstanding the intervention of a war Avith England commenced at a period of the greatest financial embarrassment. I have been induced to take so extended a notice of this matter as well by the circumstance, to Avhich I have before referred, that it presented a leading subject of party divisions in this country, as because of the influence which it and its adjuncts the Bank of the United States and the Protective System have exerted upon our politics. It has been seen that the Funding System, however, preceded the bank in its establishment, and it became also an \" obsolete idea \" many years before the latter was declared to be such by its most devoted advocate and reckless supporter, Daniel Webster. That the bank did not share that fate at a much earlier period Avas because Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, both disciples of the old Republican school, \u2014 the former one of the ablest among the opponents of the revival of the bank in 1811, \u2014 tempted by the political allurements of the day in 1815, advocated the establishment of a new"], [435, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 413 bank, and because that pure man and patriot, James Mad ison, under \"mistaken impressions in respect to the absolute necessity of such an institution, gave his assent to its in corporation. No public question was ever longer or more severely agitated in any country than that of the existence of a national bank has been in this. Madison acquired endur ing honor by his unanswerable speech against its constitu tionality. It divided the cabinet of President Washington, and contributed with other causes to give birth to a political party which kept his administration at bay, overthrew that of his successor, has sustained itself in power ever since (with brief and easily explained interruptions), and is now, after the lapse of nearly seventy years, in full possession of the Federal Government. It gave position in 1811 to Henry Clay as one of the strong minds of the country, de rived from his speech against rechartering the bank, by far the best speech he ever made and nearly equal to that of Madison in 1790, and it enabled that venerable revolu tionary patriot, George Clinton, to add new laurels to his already great fame by his casting vote against the passage of the bill for its re-incorporation. Whilst in 1815 it marred forever the political fortunes of Clay and Calhoun, then standing at the head of the rising Republican states men of the country, in 1830 it made memorable and glorious the civil career of AndreAV Jackson through his celebrated veto \u2014 a noble step in that fearful issue between the respective powers of the Government and the Bank, on the trial of Avhich that institution justified and confirmed Jefferson's gloomy forebodings at its first establishment by spreading recklessly and Avantonly (as is now well under stood) panic in the public mind and convulsions in the business affairs of the people, through which incalculable injury was inflicted upon the country, and by Avasting its"], [436, "414 POLITICAL PARTIES entire capital of thirty millions in wild speculation and in corrupt squandering upon parasites and political backers. It did not however prove too strong for the Government, as Mr. Jefferson apprehended, but was itself overwhelmed in utter defeat and disgrace. So thorough has been its annihilation that its books and papers were a few months since sold by auction, in Philadelphia, by the ton, as waste paper ! Who can call to mind without amazement the extent to Avhich the impression AA'as fastened on the public judg ment that a national bank was of vital necessity to the healthful action of the Federal Government, indispensable to the collection of its revenues, to the management of its finances, to the transfer of its funds from point to point, and, above all, to the execution and support of domestic exchanges, Avithout which the most important business of the country would be unavoidably suspended, and now see that all this was sheer delusion ; or who can reflect upon the bold and profligate action taken by the bank to force a compliance with its application, without acknoAvledging and admiring the wisdom of the Federal Convention in refusing, as it did almost in terms, to confer upon Congress the power to establish such an institution, so inefficient for good and so potent for mischief, or without applauding the true conservatism and patriotic spirit of the Democratic party during a forty years' struggle to expel from our system so dangerous an abuse, or without rejoicing that that great object was finally achieved and blessing the memory of the brave old man to whom the achievement is mainly to be credited. The Protective System was another of the important measures brought forward at the commencement of the Government, and had its origin in the prolific mind of Hamilton.

The idea of protection, beyond that which is incidental to a tariff for revenue and could be effected Avithout losing sight of the revenue point, was not, at that time, broached in Congress or inferable from the character of the duties imposed. It was in Hamilton's masterpiece \u2014 his elaborate report, nominally upon manu factures, but embracing in its range every pursuit of human industry susceptible of encouragement under an unlimited government \u2014 that the subject Avas first brought to the notice and recommended to the favorable consideration of Congress. I have already described, more fully, perhaps, than might on first impression be thought necessary, the length and breadth of that famous document, the boldness and ex travagance of its ultra-latitudinarian pretensions to power in the Federal Government, including unlimited authority to raise money by taxes and an equally unlimited power to spend it in any way Avhich Congress might think Avould be conducive to the general Avelfare. The vehement de nunciation of its character by Mr. Jefferson and his friends, with continually increasing indications of popular discontent, pre\\'ented Hamilton from attempting any measures worthy of notice to carry into effect his recommendations \u2014 and no assumptions, beyond the revenue standard, Avere acted upon by the administrations of either Washington or Adams. The enforcement of Hamilton's recommendations was reserved for the close of the War of 1812, a period of which I have already spoken as one which brought on the political stage a new class of Presidential aspirants, mem bers of a succeeding generation and unknown to revolu tionary fame. Among the most prominent of these stood CraAvford, Clay, Calhoun, Adams, Webster, and Lowndes,"], [438, "416 POLITICAL PARTIES \u2014 the latter, perhaps, the most likely to have succeeded, if his useful life had not been brought to a premature close. Iu the same year, 1815, was revived the idea of a national bank, and no fitter associate could have been de vised for it than the Protective System. They had a com mon origin, eA-en in their political aspects, Avere designed for a common effect, and Avere moreover alike adapted to the immediate policy of two of the Presidential aspirants of the Republican stamp, Clay and Calhoun, \u2014 that of conciliating the good-will of those Avho still clung to the wreck of the Federal party, Avhich having been shattered and disabled by its course in the war, was at the moment drifting upon the political seas. Henry Clay, with better qualifications for success than his not less ambitious rival, seized the prize in view, and after long competition from the latter, and against perpetual, though sometimes concealed opposition from Webster, attached the mass of the Federal party to his fortunes, and held them there to the close of his remarkable life. Shouldering a large share of respon sibility for the reintroduction of a national bank, he added to his programme the Protective System, stopping in the first instance at a protective tariff', but willing, as was clearly seen, to embrace Hamilton's entire scheme, and superadding to these a system of internal improvements by the Federal Government, in respect to which he went, on the point of constitutional power, beyond his great prototype. These Avere the elements out of which he constructed his famous \" American System.\" A convert to theories and measures hostile to the earliest and most cherished principles of the old Republican party, he of course soon lost his position in its ranks, aud Avas in due season installed as the leader of that with which all its wars have been waged.

Thus reinvigorated and backed by the money-power of the country, during a quarter of a century, and with never quailing spirit, he conducted that party, under various names but striving always under the banner of the same \" Ameri can System,\" through a succession of political campaigns which left their injurious traces upon the country. The fruits of this warfare against the Democratic party and its principles are familiar to politicians and observers of our times. The Bank of the United States, after filling the country with distress and ruin, itself perished ; the proposed system of internal improvements by the Federal Government was happily broken down by his opponents before it involved the country in inextricable embarrass ments, and the Protective System, after being finally over thrown in England, from Avhich country we had copied it, was abandoned here also, and consigned by the judgment of the people to the same oblivion Avith its kindred delu sions. The promotion of internal improvements by the General Government Avas an assumption of poAver by Congress, against Avhich, from its first inception till its substantial 27"], [440, "418 POLITICAL PARTIES overthrow, the Democratic party interposed a steady, per severing, and inflexible resistance. The general character of the abuse, its origin, progress, and extirpation through Democratic agencies, are fully presented in another part of this work.1 Here the probable effect upon the national treasury of arresting the practice will alone be noticed. In his annual message to Congress, December, 1834, President Jackson says : \u2014 \" When the bill authorizing a subscription on the part of the United States for stock in the Maysville and Lexing ton Turnpike Companies passed the tAvo Houses, there had been reported, by the committees of internal improvements, bills containing appropriations for such objects, exclusive of those for the Cumberland Road and for harbors and li^ht-houses, to the amount of about one hundred and six millions of dollars. In this amount was included authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to subscribe to the stock of different companies to a great extent, and the residue was principally for the direct construction of roads by this Government. In addition to those projects, which had been presented to the two Houses, under the sanction and recommendation of their respectiA'e committees on internal improvements, there were then still pending before the com mittees, and in memorials to Congress, presented but not referred, different projects for Avorks of a similar character, the expense of' which cannot be estimated Avith certainty but must haA'e exceeded one hundred millions of dollars.\" The same message contained also the following sugges tions : \u2014 \" From attempts to appropriate the national funds to objects which are confessedly of a local character, we cannot I trust have any thing further to apprehend. My views in regard to the expediency of making appropriations for 1 Referring to the Memoirs of the writer.

If the people of the United States desire that the public treasury shall be resorted to for the means to prosecute such Avorks, they will concur in an amendment of the Constitution prescribing a rule by which the national character of the A\\orks is to be tested, and by Avhich the greatest practicable equality of benefits may be secured to each member of the Confederacy. The effects of such a regulation Avould be most salutary in preventing unprofitable expenditures, in securing our legis lation from the pernicious consequences of a scramble for the favors of Government, and in repressing the spirit of discontent Avhich must inevitably arise from an unequal distribution of treasures Avhich belong alike to all.\" These declarations of President Jackson that he would approve no bill containing appropriations even for objects of a national character, until an amendment of the Consti tution Avas adopted placing such expenditures upon an equal footing towards all the States, Avere reiterated in his Maysville veto.

When made by incorporated companies under authority derived from the States they Avere at the expense of their stockholders. All must be sensible of the salutary check Avhich these circumstances are calculated to exert by increasing the circumspection and prudence with which such expenses are incurred ; and yet what immense amounts of money have been irrecoverably sunk upon such Avorks, and Avhat widespread embarrassments haA'e they at times created in the financial affairs of the country, through the headlong enterprise and adventurous spirit of our people !

For preservation from such prodigality and debt, and from the corruptions that Avould have followed in their train, we are plainly and uu deniably indebted to the successful enforcement of the prin ciples of the Democratic party.

Doubtless both of those political leaders honestly believed such a check to be necessary to the public good. With Hamilton this faith had from the beginning constituted an integral part of his political system. Clay had been, in his youth, too much a man of the people to uvoav such a belief, but that he became a convert to it in after-life I have no doubt. But the Democratic spirit of the country did not stand in need of any such restraint as that which they designed to place upon its course. I have thus adverted to some of the advantages the country has deriA'ed from the action of the Democratic party, to Avhich must be added the benefits conferred on the States by an extension of kindred principles to the administration of the local governments. If its op ponents are asked for a statement of their contributions to the public welfare when in power and by their efforts to defeat the measures of the Democratic party, or to name a great measure of which they were the authors and which has stood the test of experience, or one in the estab lishment of which they have been prevented by factious or partisan opposition, but Avhich Avould now be received with favor by the people, or a principle advocated by them for the administration of the Government, in which they have been defeated but which would now be so received, or an unsound one set up by their opponents which they have successfully resisted, \u2014 what must be the replies to ques tions so simple yet so comprehensive and important ! Can it, on the other hand, be now denied that notwithstanding the conceded capacities of their leaders, and their possession"], [445, "IN THE UNITED STATES. 423 of superior facilities for the acquisition and favorable exer cise of political power, their time and their resources have been mainly employed in efforts to establish principles and build up systems Avhich have been to all appearance irrev ocably condemned by the people, and in unavailing efforts to defeat measures and principles Avhich, after a full ex perience, have proved acceptable to them, and through the influence and operation of which the country has been gradually raised to great power and unexampled prosperity. The course of events to Avhich I have referred has had the effect of breaking up as a national organization the party so long opposed to the Democratic party, leaving the latter the only political association co-extensive in its power and influence with the Union, \u2014 and the sole survivor of all its national competitors. Of the eleven Presidents elected since its accession to power in the Federal Government, including the one in Avhose election it achieved its first national triumph, nine Avere avowed supporters of the cause it sustained, and eight its exclusive candidates.

Dear Sir, \u2014 I have to thank you for Mr. Pickering's elabo rate Philippic against Mr. Adams, Gerry, Smith, and myself; and I have delayed the acknowledgment until I could read it and make some observations on it. I could not have believed that, for so many years, and to such a period of advanced age, he could have nourished passions so vehement and viperous. It appears, that for thirty years past, he has been industriously collecting materials for vituperating the characters he had marked for his hatred ; some of whom, certainly, if enmities towards him had ever existed, had forgotten them all, or buried them in the grave with themselves. As to myself, there never had been any thing personal between us, nothing but the general opposition of party sentiment ; and our personal intercourse had been that of uibanity, as himself says. But it seems he has been all this time brooding over an enmity which I had never felt, and yet that with respect to myself as well as others, he has been writing far and near, and in every direction, to get hold of original letters, where he could, copies, where he could not, certificates and journals, catching at every gossiping story he could hear of in any quarter, supplying by suspicions what he could find nowhere else, and then arguing on this motley farrago, as if established on gospel evidence. And while expressing his wonder that \" at the age of eighty- eight, the strong passions of Mr. Adams should not have cooled ;\" that on the contrary \" they had acquired the mastery of his soul \" (p. 100) ; that \" where these were enlisted, no reliance could be placed on his statements\" (p. 104) ; \"the"], [448, "426 APPENDIX. facility and little truth with which he could represent facts and occurrences, concerning persons who were the objects of his hatred (p. 3) ; that \" he is capable of making the grossest mis representations, and, from detached facts, and often from bare suspicions, of drawing unwarrantable inferences, if suited to his purpose at the instant\" (p. 174) ; while making such charges, I say, on Mr. Adams, instead of his \" ecce homo\" (p. 100), how justly might we say to him, \" mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur.\" For the assiduity and industry he has employed in his benevolent researches after matter of crimination against us, I refer to his pages 13, 14, 34, 36, 46, 71, 79, 90, bis. 92, 93, bis. 101, ter. 104, 116, 118, 141, 143, 146, 150, 151, 153, 168, 171, 172. That Mr. Adams' strictures on him, written and printed, should have excited some notice on his part, was not perhaps to be wondered at. But the sufficiency of his motive for the large attack on me may be more questionable. He says (p. 4), \"of Mr. Jefferson I should have said noth ing, but for his letter to Mr. Adams, of October 12th, 1823.\" Now the object of that letter was to soothe the feelings of a friend, wounded by a publication which I thought an \"outrage on private confidence.\" Not a word or allusion in it respected Mr. Pickering, nor was it suspected that it would draw forth his pen in justification of this infidelity, which he has, however, undertaken in the course of his pamphlet, but more particularly in its conclusion. He arraigns me on two grounds, my actions and my motives. The very actions, however, which he arraigns, have been such as the great majority of my fellow citizens have approved. The approbation of Mr. Pickering, and of those who thought with him, I had no right to expect. My motives he chuses to ascribe to hypocrisy, to ambition, and a passion for popularity. Of these the world must judge between us. It is no office of his or mine. To that tribunal I have ever submitted my actions and motives, without ransacking the Union for certificates, letters, journals, and gossiping tales, to justify myself and weary them. Nor shall I do this on the present occasion, but leave still to them these antiquated party diatribes, now newly re vamped and paraded as if they had not been already a thousand"], [449, "APPENDIX. 427 times repeated, refuted, and adjudged against him, by the nation itself. If no action is to be deemed virtuous for which malice can imagine a sinister motive, then there never was a virtuous action ; no, not even in the life of our Saviour himself. But he has taught us to judge the tree by its fruit, and to leave motives to him who can alone see into them. But whilst I leave to its fate the libel of Mr. Pickering, with the thousands of others like it, to which I have given no other answer than a steady course of similar action, there are two facts or fancies of his which I must set to rights. The one respects Mr. Adams, the other myself. He observes that my letter of Octo \" .r I2th, 1823, acknowledges the receipt of one from Mr. i.dams, of September 18th, which, having been written a few days after Cunningham's publication, he says was no doubt written to apologize to me for the pointed re proaches he had uttered against me in his confidential letters to Cunningham. And thus having \" no doubt \" of his conjecture, he considers it as proven, goes on to suppose the contents of the letter (19, 22), makes it place Mr. Adams at my feet suing for pardon, and continues to rant upon it, as an undoubted fact. Now, I do most solemnly declare, that so far from being a letter of apology, as Mr. Pickering so undoubtingly assumes, there was not a word nor allusion in it respecting Cunningham's pub lication. The other allegation, respecting myself, is equally false. In page 34, he quotes Doctor Stuart as having, twenty years ago, informed him that General Washington, \" when he became a private citizen,\" called me to account for expressions in a letter to Mazzei, requiring, in a tone of unusual severity, an explana tion of that letter. He adds of himself, \"in what manner the latter humbled himself and appeased the just resentment of * Washington, will never be known, as some time after his death the correspondence was not to be found, and a diary for an important period of his Presidency was also missing.\" The diary being of transactions during his Presidency, the letter to Mazzei not known here until some time aster he became a private citizen, and the pretended correspondence of course after that, I know not why this lost diary and supposed correspond-"], [450, "428 APPENDIX. ence are brought together here, unless for insinuations worthy of the letter itself. The correspondence could not be found, indeed, because it had never existed. I do affirm that there never passed a word, written or verbal, directly or indirectly, between General Washington and myself on the subject of that letter. He would never have degraded himself so far as to take to himself the imputation in that letter on the \" Samsons in combat.\" The whole story is a fabrication, and I defy the framers of it, and all mankind, to produce a scrip of a pen between General Washington and myself on the subject, or any other evidence more worthy of credit than the suspicions, suppositions and presumptions of the two persons here quoting and quoted for it. With Doctor Stuart I had not much ac quaintance. I supposed him to be an honest man, knew him to be a very weak one, and, like Mr. Pickering, very prone to antipathies, boiling with party passions, and under the dominion of these readily welcoming fancies for facts. But come the story from whomsoever it might, it is an unqualified falsehood. This letter to Mazzei has been a precious theme of crimina tion for Federal malice. It was a long letter of business, in which was inserted a single paragraph only of political informa tion as to the state of our country. In this information there was not one word which would not then have been, or would not now be approved by every Republican in the United States, looking back to those times ; as you will see by a faithful copy now enclosed of the whole of what that letter said on the subject of the United States, or of its government. This paragraph, extracted and translated, got into a Paris paper at a time when the persons in power there were laboring under very general disfavor, and their friends were eager to catch even at straws to buoy them up. To them, therefore, I have always imputed the interpolation of an entire paragraph additional to mine, which makes me charge my own country with ingratitude and injustice to France. There was not a word in my letter respecting France, or any of the proceedings or relations between this country and that. Yet this interpolated paragraph has been the burthen of Federal calumny, has been constantly quoted by them, made the subject of unceasing and virulent abuse, and is"], [451, "APPENDIX. 429 still quoted, as you see, by Mr. Pickering, page 33, as if it were genuine, and really written by me. And even Judge Marshall makes history descend from its dignity, and the ermine from its sanctity, to exaggerate, to record, and to sanction this forgery. In the very last note of his book, he says, \"a letter from Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Mazzei, an Italian, was published in Florence, and republished in the ' Moniteur,' with very severe strictures on the conduct of the United States.\" And instead of the letter itself, he copies what he says are the remarks of the editor, which are an exaggerated commentary on the fabricated para graph itself, and silently leaves to his reader to make the ready inference that these were the sentiments of the letter. Proof is the duty of the affirmative side. A negative cannot be positively proved. But, in defect of impossible proof of what was not in the original letter, I have its press-copy still in my possession. It has been shown to several, and is open to any one who wishes to see it. I have presumed only, that the interpolation was done in Paris. But I never saw the letter in either its Italian or French dress, and it may have been done here, with the commentary handed down to posterity by the Judge. The genuine paragraph, retranslated through Italian and French into English, as it appeared here in a Federal paper, besides the mutilated hue which these translations and retransla tions of it produced generally, gave a mistranslation of a single word, which entirely perverted its meaning, and made it a pliant and fertile text of misrepresentation of my political principles. The original, speaking of an Anglican, monarchical, and aristo cratical party, which had sprung up since he had left us, states their object to be \" to draw over us the substance, as they had already done the forms of the British Government.\" Now the forms here meant, were the levees, birthdays, the pompous cavalcade to the state house on the meeting of Congress, the formal speech from the throne, the procession of Congress in a body to reecho the speech in an answer, &c, &c. But the translator here, by substituting form in the singular number, for forms in the plural, made it mean the frame or organization of our government, or hsform of legislative, execut've, and judiciary authorities coordinate and independent ; to which form it was"], [452, "430 APPENDIX. to be inferred that I was an enemy. In this sense they always quoted it, and in this sense Mr. Pickering still quotes it, pages 34, 35, 38, and countenances the inference. Now General Washington perfectly understood what I meant by these forms, as they were frequent subjects of conversation between us. When, on my return from Europe, I joined the government in March 1-90, at New York, I was much astonished, indeed, at the mimicry I found established of royal forms and ceremonies, and more alarmed at the unexpected phenomenon, by the monarchical sentiments I heard expressed and openly maintained in every company, and among others by the high members of the government, executive and judiciary, (General Washington alone excepted,) and by a great part of the legislature, save only some members who had been of the old Congress, and a very few of recent introduction. I took occasion, at various times, of expressing to General Washington my disappointment at these symptoms of a change of principle, and that I thought them encouraged by the forms and ceremonies which I found prevailing, not at all in character with the simplicity of Republican government, and looking as if wishfully to those of European courts. His general explanations to me were that when he arrived at New York, to enter on the executive administration of the new government, he observed to those who were to assist him, that, placed as he was in an office entirely new to him, unacquainted with the forms and ceremonies of other gov ernments, still less apprized of those which might be prop erly established here, and himself perfectly indifferent to all forms, he wished them to consider and prescribe what they should be ; and the task was assigned particularly to General Knox, a man of parade, and to Colonel Humphreys, who had resided some time at a foreign court. They, he said, were the authors of the present regulations, and that others were pro posed so highly strained that he absolutely rejected them. At tentive to the difference of opinion prevailing on this subject, when the term of his second election arrived he called the heads of departments together, observed to them the situation in which he had been at the commencement of the government, the advice he had taken and the course he had observed in com-"], [453, "APPENDIX. 431 pliance with it ; that a proper occasion had now arrived of revising that course, of correcting in it any particulars not ap proved in experience, and he desired us to consult together, agree on any changes we should think for the better, and that he should willingly conform to what we should advise. We met at my office. Hamilton and myself agreed at once that there was too much ceremony for the character of our government, and particularly, that the parade of the installation at New York ought not to be copied on the present occasion ; that the Presi dent should desire the Chief Justice to attend him at his chambers, that he should administer the oath of office to him in the pres ence of the higher officers of the government, and that the certificate of the fact should be delivered to the Secretary of State to be recorded. Randolph and Knox differed from us, the latter vehemently ; they thought it not advisable to change any of the established forms, and we authorized Randolph to report our opinions to the President. As these opinions were divided, and no positive advice given as to any change, no change was made. Thus the forms which I had censured in my letter to Mazzei were perfectly understood by General Washington, and were those which he himself but barely tolerated. He had furnished me a proper occasion for proposing their reformation, and, my opinion not prevailing, he knew I could not have meant any part of the censure, for him. Mr. Pickering quotes, too (page 34), the expression in the letter of \" the men who were Samsons in the field, and Solo .mons in the council, but who had had their heads shorn by the harlot England ; \" or, as expressed in their re-translation, \" the men who were Solomons in council, and Samsons in combat, but whose hair had been cut off by the whore England.\" Now this expression also was perfectly understood by General Wash ington. He knew that I meant it for the Cincinnati generally, and that, from what had passed between us at the commence ment of that institution, I could not mean to include him. When the first meeting was called for its establishment, I was a member of the Congress then sitting at Annapolis. General Washington wrote to me, asking my opinion on that proposition, and the course, if any, which I thought Congress would observe"], [454, "432 APPENDIX. respecting it. I wrote him frankly my own disapprobation of it; that I found the members of Congress generally in the same sentiment; that I thought they would take no express notice of it, but that in ail appointments of trust, honor, or profit, they would silently pass by all candidates of that order, and give an uniform preference to others. On his way to the first meeting in Philadelphia, which I think was in the spring of 1 784, he called on me at Annapolis. It was a little after candle-light, and he sat with me till after midnight, conversing, almost ex- clusively, on that subject. While he was feelingly indulgent to the motives which might induce the officers to promote it, he concurred with me entirely in condemning it; and when I expressed an idea that if the hereditary quality were suppressed, the institution might perhaps be indulged during the lives of the officers now living, and who had actually served, \" no,\" he said, \" not a fibre of it ought to be left, to be an eye-sore to the public, a ground of dissatisfaction, and a line of separation between them and their country ; \" and he left me with a de termination to use all his influence for its entire suppression. On his return from the meeting he called on me again, and related to me the course the thing had taken. He said that from the beginning, he had used every endeavor to prevail on the officers to renounce the project altogether, urging the many considerations which would render it odious to their fellow citizens, and disreputable and injurious to themselves ; that he had at length prevailed on most of the old officers to reject it, although with great and warm opposition from others, and. especially the younger ones, among whom he named Colonel W. S. Smith as particularly intemperate. But that, in this state of things, when he thought the question safe, and the meeting drawing to a close, Major L'Enfant arrived from France, with a bundle of eagles, for which he had been sent there, with letters from the French officers who had served in America, praying for admission into the order, and a solemn act of their king permitting them to wear its ensign. This, he said, changed the face of matters at once, produced an entire revul- sion of sentiment, and turned the torrent so strongly in an opposite direction that it could be no longer withstood ; all he"], [455, "APPENDIX. 433 could then obtain was a suppression of the hereditary quality. He added that it was the French applications, and respect for the approbation of the king, which saved the establishment in its modified and temporary form. Disapproving thus of the insti tution as much as I did, and conscious that I knew him to do so, he could never suppose I meant to include him amona the Samsons in the field, whose object was to draw over us the form, as they made the letter say, of the British Government, and especially its aristocratic member, an hereditary house of lords. Add to this, that the letter saying that \" two out of the three branches of legislature were against us \" was an obvious exception of him ; it being well known that the majorities in the two branches, of Senate and Representatives, were the very instruments which carried, in opposition to the old and real Republicans, the measures which were the subjects of condem nation in this letter. General Washington then, understanding perfectly what and whom I meant to designate, in both phrases, and that they could not have any application or view to himself, could find, in neither, any cause of offence to himself; and therefore neither needed, nor ever asked any explanation of them from me. Had it even been otherwise, they must know very little of General Washington, who should believe to be within the laws of his character what Doctor Stuart is said to have imputed to him. Be this, however, as it may, the story is infamously false in every article of it. My last parting with General Washington was at the inauguration of Mr. Adams, in March, 1797, and was warmly affectionate ; and I never had any reason to believe any change on his part, as there certainly was none on mine. But one session of Congress intervened between that and his death, the year following, in my passage to and from which as it happened to be not convenient to call on him, I never had another opportunity ; and as to the cessation of correspondence observed during that short interval, no particular circumstance occurred for epistolary communication, and both of us were too much oppressed with letter-writing, to trouble, either the other, with a letter about nothing. The truth is that the Federalists, pretending to be the exclu sive friends of General Washington, have ever done what they 28"], [456, "434 APPENDIX. could to sink his character, by hanging theirs on it, and by rep resenting as the enemy of Republicans him who, of all men, is best entitled to the appellation of the father of that republic which they were endeavoring to subvert, and the Republicans to maintain. They cannot deny, because the elections proclaimed the truth, that the great body of the nation approved the re publican measures. General Washington was himself sincerely a friend to the republican principles of our constitution. His faith, perhaps, in its duration, might not have been as confident as mine ; but he repeatedly declared to me that he was deter mined it should have a fair chance for success ; and that he would lose the last drop of his blood in its support, against any attempt which might be made to change it from its republican form. He made these declarations the oftener because he knew my suspicions that Hamilton had other views, and he wished to quiet my jealousies on this subject. For Hamilton frankly avowed that he considered the British Constitution, with all the corruptions of its administration, as the most perfect model of government which had ever been devised by the wit of man ; professing however, at the same time, that the spirit of this country was so fundamentally republican, that it would be visionary to think of introducing monarchy here, and that, therefore, it was the duty of its administrators to conduct it on the principles their constituents had elected. General Washington, after the retirement of his first cabinet, and the composition of his second, entirely Federal, and at the head of which was Mr. Pickering himself, had no opportunity of hearing both sides of any question. His measures, conse quently, took more the hue of the party in whose hands he was. These measures were certainly not approved by the Re publicans ; yet were they not imputed to him, but to the coun sellors around him ; and his prudence so far restrained their impassioned course and bias, that no act of strong mark, during the remainder of his administration, excited much dissatisfaction. He lived too short a time after, and too much withdrawn from information, to correct the views into which he had been de luded ; and the continued assiduities of the party drew him into the vortex of their intemperate career, separated him still"], [457, "APPENDIX. 435 farther from his real friends, and excited him to actions and expressions of dissatisfaction, which grieved them, but could not loosen their affections from him. They would not suffer this temporary aberration to weigh against the immeasurable merits of his life ; and although they tumbled his seducers from their places, they preserved his memory embalmed in their hearts, with undiminished love and devotion ; and there it for ever will remain embalmed, in entire oblivion of every tem porary thing which might cloud the glories of his splendid life. It is vain, then, for Mr. Pickering and his friends to endeavor to falsify his character, by representing him as an enemy to Republicans and republican principles, and as exclusively the friend of those who were so ; and had he lived longer, he would have returned to his ancient and unbiased opinions, would have replaced his confidence in those whom the people approved and supported, and would have seen that they were only restoring and acting on the principles of his own first administration. I find, my dear Sir, that I have written you a very long letter, or rather a history. The civility of having sent me a copy of Mr. Pickering's diatribe, would scarcely justify its address to you. I do not publish these things, because my rule of life has been never to harass the public with fendings and provings of personal slanders ; and least of all would I descend into the arena of slander with such a champion as Mr. Pickering. I have ever trusted to the justice and consideration of my fellow citizens, and have no reason to repent it, or to change my course. At this time of life too, tranquillity is the summum bonum. But although I decline all newspaper controversy, yet, when falsehoods have been advanced, within the knowledge of no one so much as myself, I have sometimes deposited a con tradiction in the hands of a friend, which, if worth preservation, may, when I am no more, nor those whom it might offend, throw light on history, and recall that into the path of truth. And, if of no other value, the present communication may amuse you with anecdotes not known to every one. I had meant to have added some views on the amalgamation of parties, to which your favor of the 8th has some allusion ;"], [458, "436 APPENDIX. an amalgamation of name, but not of principle. Tories are tories still, by whatever name they may be called. But my letter is already too unmercifully long, and I close it here with assurances of my great esteem and respectful considera tion. TH. JEFFERSON. \\_Enclosed in the above.] Extract of a Letter from Th. Jefferson, to Philip Mazzei, April 24, 1796. \" The aspect of our politics has wonderfully changed since you left us. In place of that noble love of liberty and repub lican Government which carried us triumphantly through the war, an Anglican, Monarchical and Aristocratical party has sprung up, whose avowed object is to draw over us the sub stance as they have already done the forms of the British gov ernment. The main body of our citizens, however, remain true to their republican principles. The whole landed interest is republican, and so is a great mass of talent. Against us are the Executive, the Judiciary, two out of three branches of the legislature, all the officers of the government, all who want to be officers, all timid men who prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty, British merchants, and Americans trading on British capitals, speculators, and holders in the banks and public funds, \u2014 a contrivance invented for the purpose of corruption, and for assimilating us in all things to the rotten as well as the sound parts of the British model. It would give you a fever were I to name to you the apostates who have gone over to these heresies ; men who were Samsons in the field, and Solomons in the council, but who have had their heads shorn by the harlot England. In short, we are likely to pre serve the liberty we have obtained only by unremitting labors and perils. But we shall preserve them ; and our mass of weight and wealth on the good side is so great as to leave no danger that force will ever be attempted against us. We have only to awake and snap the Liliputian cords with which they have been entangling us during the first sleep which succeeded our labors.\" 25 JY 67"], [459, ""], [460, ""], [461, ""], [462, ""], [463, ""], [464, ""]]
