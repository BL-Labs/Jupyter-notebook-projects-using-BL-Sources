SCUILLER. One of the quaintest of straggling houses was Lomond Manor, situated in a lonely and re mote part of the Highlands ; it belonged to a certain Mr. Beaumanoir, a man well known to the gay worlds of Paris and Vienna, which B 3"], [14, "4 THE CAREER OF capitals he preferred to London. A handsome man was Mr. Beaumanoir, witty, gentleman like, liberal\u2014 he had all the gentle suavity, the lighter qualities, the profuse generosity, that makes a man courted in whatever circles he may appear. It is easily imagined that he did not often honor so dull a neighbourhood as Lomond, except for an occasional few weeks in the autumn, and not always then, for he had a large acquaintance among Austrian and Prussian noblemen, who were glad to hail him as their guest. Mr. Beaumanoir had one excuse for the little love he evinced for Lomond. He had no ties of ancestry or even country, to bind him to the place. He was an Englishman, and had come there with his wife many years ago ; he was then seemingly in very poor circumstances, in fact the neighbours hinted that the death of his wife had been hastened, if not caused by grief and want. Almost immediately after wards, the old and childless man, who then"], [15, "5 A RISING MAN. lived at Lomond, died, and was found to have bequeathed them his property, on condition that Mr. Burke, as he was then called, should take his name. In his will he stated plainly that it was for the children that he had left him his fortune. Such was his previous history. Great was the excitement, when the housekeeper heard that some of the family were coming home, intending permanently to reside there. Beaumanoir was a widower, and many fair ladies would have been surprised if they had known that he was the father of a youth of nineteen, and a girl of fourteen. He looked so young, so much a bachelor, it was almost incredible, but so it was. It was his son and daughter, who, after a prolonged tour on the continent, were coming to live for the future, at Lomond. A few years before, the child caught a severe fever. Robert, her brother \u2014 who had been to her playfellow, guardian, instructor \u2014 loving her as his own soul, was in"], [16, "6 THE CAREER OF despair, when she recovered, blind. He had then just left school \u2014 he gave up all thoughts of Oxford, and devoted his time and life to his beloved charge. She was very frail and deli cate, and the doctors, believing her blindness only caused by physical weakness, recom mended her the air of Germany. Her health gradually improving, they remained there. Robert studied at Gottingen ; between terms he took her to Italy, to Spain ; occasionally Mr. Beaumanoir accompanied them ; more often, only her governess was with them. Loving one another fondly as they did, those years, to the brother and sister, were, in spite of her misfortuue, happy ones. Her governess had only a nominal post. Robert was her tutor \u2014 he read to her \u2014 he in structed her. S;ie learnt to see the world with his eyes \u2014 almost to think with his thoughts. And though month by month the hope of recovery gradually faded, it seemed to"], [17, "7 A RISING MAN. affect him more than it affected her. Always cheerful, the loving child was too grateful, too devoted to him, to be unhappy. About two miles from the Manor, was a shooting lodge, which had belonged to some nobleman, too poor to keep, and too proud to sell it ; it had been almost in ruins for the last dozen years, but he had lately died, and the gentleman to whom it had come, through his wife \u2014 a man of active habits and easy fortune \u2014 had paid off the mortgages, and re built the lodge, in which, during the shooting season, he intended to reside. This gentle man was a Mr. Herbert, Secretary of State, and well known in his younger days as an author of repute. It was the day after their return home. Early in the morning Robert Beaumanoir was out visiting his favorite haunts. The grounds were very beautiful, well wooded, and undu lating enough to diversify the view. Through the park a small stream bubbled noisily ; and"], [18, "8 THE CAREER OF by this stream the young man threw himself to rest after his long walk. It was a splendid September morning. A few light clouds occa sionally veiled the too powerful glory of the sun. Recent rains had restored the freshness and beauty of the grass and flowers ; they smiled as with a second youth ; it was only the deeper tints of the foliage that betrayed the illusion. Robert Beaumanoir surveyed the scene with a glance of pride and pleasure \u2014 he was attached to his home as most serious people are to the place where they have long dwelt. It is only your gay, careless men who are cosmopolitan. He had a book with him, but he did not attempt to read, occupied sufficiently with the thoughts that thronged upon him. \"While he thus lay indulging his reverie, there advanced from the other side of the brook, a man of middle height, habited in a shooting jacket, and his features shaded by a straw-hat. Near to where Robert was lying was a rustic bridge"], [19, "9 A RISING MAN. fording the stream, and on this bridge the man paused, and leaning on its rough parapet, seemed to be scanning the landscape. He was apparently about fifty years of age, with features irregular, but sharply cut, and with a mouth that was expressive enough to have redeemed a plainer face. His eyes were small, of an iron grey, very bright and quick. His movements, too, were active, almost restless; and as he stood upon the bridge, thinking himself alone, his features seemed disturbed and anxious ; and he muttered almost audibly. He started when his roving eye rested upon Robert Beau- manoir, fearing that his discomposure had been observed. When he saw that he was still un- noticed, he leant again upon the parapet and amused himself by a close scrutiny of the unconscious Robert. As he so lay his coun tenance and expression were striking enough to have impressed a more careless eye than this intruder's. Features fine and firmly cut, did not make Robert's a handsome countenance, B 5"], [20, "10 THE CAREER OF but a remarkable one; it was too thin, too sallow, too rigid for beauty. It gave promise in after years of a noble, never a handsome face.

Ciiilde Harold. Saville Herbert, the present owner of Heath Lodge, was one of those men that the present day could hardly produce. At the time his career began, the number of competitors for the grand prizes, although great, were not so many as to make victory almost an impossibi lity. The bar was a good field ; war enabled the army and navy to reward merit. Literature"], [26, "16 THE CAREER OF gave higher prizes to fewer candidates ; an in ferior writer made, a greater sensation.

He studied intensely, spoke little, but when he did, he showed great talents, and brilliant more than lofty thought. His father, who was proud of him in his young days groaned in spirit when the boy, as he grew older, read less steadily, fell in love, and talked satire and sentiment. His mother, herself a clever woman, did her son more justice. She thought he might be something greater than a poor bar rister, without connexions, and so most likely briefless until his rich locks had turned to grey. She assisted him in his stolen studies."], [27, "17 A RISING MAN. She read with him ethics, poetry, history, and then saw him depart without fear to pursue his studies in town. The lawyers with whom he read said that Saville Herbert bad great intellect but no dili gence, no power of concentration. He was satisfied with a brilliant effect \u2014 he seized a great outline \u2014 he could not plod. He flew to Demosthenes and Cicero instead of his law books. \" A man,\" he used to cry, \" could be an orator when he had to plead against Philip or Cataline, but what was there to rouse the genius of a man when his subjeot was a petty theft, or a brutal case of assault.\" Now, undoubtedly Saville was greatly in the wrong ; Philips and Catilines are rare, but larceny and assault every day affect the well being of the community. And besides \u2014 oratory is a means, not an end. By the time he was called to the bar, he was disgusted with his profession \u2014 he became an author, at"], [28, "18 THE CAREER OF first secretly, but when he had won success, avowedly. His style, sparkling, clever, ex travagant, drew attention. At that time pamphlets were more read, and party squibs were the \" Punch\" of the day. An author who could denounce, laugh at, refute in a para graph \u2014 who was sufficiently a lawyer to make much out of little, was not to be neglected. The Opposition, always anxious to secure clever and young men, flattered, caressed, lionized. It was pleasant to be site, but Herbert was not content with an idle triumph. As a lawyer he had ruined his career \u2014 people do not entrust their affairs to an eccentric young man, a satirist, a poet, and a genius. The Whigs, daily gathering in force, only because they neglected no aid, however trivial, strove to gain over a still wavering but clever debutant. Saville began his career in the Opposition, where most poor, restless, and ambitious men seek a refuge ; but after a few months he was coy of dinners and refused balls. He wrote at"], [29, "A RISING MAN. 19 that time his most startling treatise. It was the work of a disappointed man \u2014 trying, by the strength of genius, to force himself upon a party. \" Hester,\" said Mr. Pitt to his niece, as he threw down the pamphlet, \" will you remind me to ask this young man to dinner.

Let it be next Friday to meet Canning \u2014 they can hurl verses at one ano ther.\" So Saville, dined with the Minister.

Dull country members still af fected to distrust the brilliant Herbert. His very colleagues only in part relied on the firmest support they had. That he was an author was brought against him as a politician ; as a politician he raised hostile criticism against his writings. Thousands of sage wit ticisms as to the difference between the draw ing up of a protocol and a poem, a treaty aud a treatise, were vouchsafed him, and like all men of imaginative temperament, Herbert had the misfortune to be sensitive.

Yet if her mind could not comprehend his, her heart might still echo to his own ; another few weeks taught him that if she had a heart, his share in it was very small. So ended his dream of domestic happiness. Even the natural wish of a man, the maker of his own fortunes, to be the founder of a family, was disappointed, for he was cluldless.

At least, he came in contact with wit and talent ; and that vision of his youth, half imagination, half remem brance, of a living embodiment of purity, and tenderness, and loveliness, gradually faded before the more dazzling reality around him.

Not that he remained aloof with the impertinent superciliousness of an incroyable, but there was a certain reserve in his manner that kept him from all but those with whom he was tolerably intimate.

The poor old man knew that Algernon did not care for him, he thought him eagerly awaiting his death ; he disliked his common-place character, he disliked his attentions, paid as so many duties. He disliked him, strange paradox, because he had been the enemy of his disowned son, because he stood in the place of the dead.

Poor Roland ! his had been a sad old age ; a youth of passion and excess, left to those years that should be so calm and holy but painful memories of energies squandered and talents neglected. Selfish from first to last, selfish in his anger, selfish even in his love, he could recal no good deeds to give a pleasant remembrance \u2014 no great ones to bestow a proud one. He had for many years withdrawn from all society. \" It is no use,\" he replied to his son's occa sional remonstrances, \"I do not suit these times, and the times do not suit me. In my time, there Avas society, defined, high-bred, good society. I do not pretend to understand a modern cohac.

One lovely June morn ing, Mr. Daly knocked at the door of his dressing-room \u2014 he generally sat there now.
