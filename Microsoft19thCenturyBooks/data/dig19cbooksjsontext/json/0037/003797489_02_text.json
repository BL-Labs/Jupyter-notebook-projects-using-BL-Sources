CHAPTER I. THE ELECTION. The important day arrived at last. The nomination of candidates had but whetted the appetites of the country-side politicians, and they now made ready for the substantial dish of the contest. Old elections are gone in the Limbo of Days and Things, and our modern ones have assumed a gravity and dignity much at variance with the stormy saturnaha of by gone struggles. For in truth, although men of our land may turn with pride to the records of our Parhaments and the wisdom of our states men, for at least a hundred years our country was in a sad condition whilst they were being elected, when every place that was not led by its owner to elect whomsoever he would (till even a black footman was threatened as an alter- native to some temporarily stubborn borough, VOL. II. 18"], [12, "2 TWO PARDONS. and would have been returned had he been sent) was a scene of riot and confusion that would have put old Rome to the blush. It speaks volumes for our old statesmen that, with such material as they got sent to Parliament in those days, they kept the good ship Britannia on her course at all. And certain it is that those w-ho were seeking the suffrages of the electors paid dearly for their victories or defeats, not in money alone, but in dignity. To be for a fort night at once the host and the butt of all the greasy vagabonds of the town, to be cap in hand and hand in fist with men from whom at ordinary times the width of the street was scarcely division enough, to fawn on men wrhose usual habits were to fawrn, to put up with the arrogance of a term, the importance of an occasion, the haughtiness of an hour \u2014 and there is no such arrogance, no such importance, no such haughtiness, as that of your Jack in office, your political pork-butcher, your \\intner with a vote \u2014 this was the way in which the candidate earned his victory, if he gained it, and with this was his defeat embittered ten fold when he lost the clay. And after all this humiliation and unbending, the candidate faced on the day of the election about as much"], [13, "THE ELECTION. 3 > actual danger as the leader of a cutting-out expedition in a foreign harbour, and had doubly to bend, first to the plaudits of his friends, and next from the missiles of his foes. Add to this the knowledge that the mob were, in those days at least, totally without influence over the election, that the noisy, unwashed, vicious crowd which made the town hideous for a day had not a single vote to the hundred of them. No, their suasion was that of force, the argument of the bludgeon, the logic of the boot ; and it was with very small satisfaction indeed that the good people of Avonham saw7 that from early dawn there poured into the town all the loafers and roughs from the country round, eager for sport, as they termed the day's proceedings, and, like aU bucohc roughs, ready in a moment to exchange the stohd bovine indifference of every-day hfe for the cruelly unreasoning bovine madness w7hich, when it does break out \u2014 which, thank God, happens but seldom \u2014 leaves far behind in its vicious destructiveness the hunger-spurred vengeance of the Lancashire meal mob or the cowardly brutahty of the race course rough.

The Western man will take his opponent's by \" fair fighting and no knives,\" and grudges not his own, fights best indeed when a little is let out ; your ordinary mob has no taste for defeat, and none but Western men will stand against troops. There was no election in Dunstalne. Their business was done on nomination day, and the former member had a w-alk over, but he had not omitted to range himself on Mr. Boldham's side at Avonham, and was here to-day with many of his prominent supporters to help the cause and strengthen the hands of his party. Of course, the Dunstalne folk wore here in force ; they had had no fun in their ow-n town, it was obvious that they must patronise the entertainment provided for them by their neighbours, and as it would be unfair to come without some addition to the performance, they brought over with them a powerful but roughly-trained brass band, winch stationed itself outside the \" Woolpack \" at seven o'clock in the morning, and raised the hair from the scalps of early breakfasters by its first terrible blast. Forth sallied at once the members of"], [15, "THE ELECTION. 5 the two bands already engaged by the rival candidates, and, in ten minutes more, quietness and peace were gone, at least for that day, from the tow-n. In half-an-hour the early breakfasters were out in the streets, and the late ones were eating in Pandemonium. The polls were opened at eight. The Mayor was in his place as returning officer, and already the pubhc-houses began to be patronised. The quieter portion of the electors hastened to place their votes on record, and the fray fairly began. Of course for such a small tow7n as Avonham there was but one polling place needed, and this was a wooden erection covered by a sloping board roof, and approached by steps ; up these the electors chmbed and recorded their votes aloud for either candidate. Behind the returning officer were the friends of the two opponents, and from time to time during the day the principals themselves looked in to see how the parties wore getting on ; saluting one another courteously when they met, partly from the innate respect each felt for the othei, and partly with a view of setting a good example to the two mobs who, as the hour of noon approached, began to get very noisy, and"], [16, "6 TWO PARDONS. hailed with tumultuous enthusiasm the various states of the poll as exhibited from the balcony of the \"George\" and the window of the \" Woolpack.\" These wore received from the checking clerks, wiio, posted behind the returning officer, scored each vote as it was given, and vociferously aided their party by shouting : \" Thank you for Mr. Boldham,\" \" Thank you for Sir Headingly Cann.\" These gentlemen got hotter and louder and more enthusiastic as the day advanced \u2014 munched at sandwiches, quaffed bottled ale and sherry provided by the candidates, and felt greatly uplifted by being part and parcel of the election itself, and second in importance only to the two combatants themselves. Two hours after the poll opened the first announcement of numbers was made \u2014 Boldham 97 Cann 89 This wras received by the Dunstalne contingent and the Yellow party with great cheering, rephed to by the Blues with equal vigour. Then an hour after came the second list \u2014 Boldham 173 Cann 166"], [17, "THE ELECTION. \u2014 after which Sir Headingly took a drive through the town and gave his followers heart. There w7as as yet, however, compara tively httle excitement, and beyond being made the peg on which to hang cheers and chaff, the figures roused but little real interest. Walter Rivers was, however, busy, and had promised his uncle that he should be ahead at noon. He accordingly marched down from the \" George \" a large number of voters, and although the movement was vigorously responded to by the opposite party, he was able to keep his word, and shortly after twelve o'clock the Baronet was received at his com mittee-rooms with a hearty burst of cheers, dehght that he had the numbers shown and saw to his great headed his opponent, being \u2014 Cann 246 Boldham 231 Of course the change of affairs gave new zest to the struggle.

Mr."], [18, "8 TWO PARDONS. Daniel Follwell, an ardent supporter of Mr. Boldham, escorted his owrn workmen to the poll, and having seen that each man registered for his candidate, he recorded his own vote, and gave his men holiday for the rest of the day. Most of the small shopkeepers followed his example, not only as to holiday, but as to voting, for the influence of the Bank was great, and none dared go against his own interest so far as to run counter to a moneyed man who had the voter in his powor. It was greatly on this that Mr. Boldham and Shelman relied for their success. Mr. Rann had spoken truly when he said that pohtics in Avonham had been dead so long that interest would greatly influence the result of the election ; and Sir Headingly felt somewhat this way himself, for he said to his nephew as they took a glass of sherry together in the middle of the day, '\" We're beginning to find the Bank in fluence now, Walter.\" \" We hold them safe, sir,\" rephed Walter, \" though the fight will be closer than I thought at first ; but I am sure of a hundred majority \u2014 I have very nearly that on the books.

Everyone would have gone gravely and peaceably to his busi ness again, one to his farm and another to his merchandise, as the good old Scriptural phrase puts it, and the election would have been comfortably stowed away in people's memories, to serve, perhaps, as a topic of conversation for man}7 a future da}7, but to trouble the towm no more.

And just as the floods were forgotten yearly, wiien the river resumed its peaceable behaviour, so would the election have been forgotten if the Avonhamites had been left to themselves. But there were out side influences at work and pressure from without, and the town was destined to be flooded tins time in a manner which would not easily fade out of the memories of its inhabitants. The inns, both great and small, were full ; at the \" George \" there was jubilation, at the \" Woolpack \" irritation, and cogitation at the \" Bear.\" The Blue party celebrated their victory by much singing of songs, much shaking of hands, and draining of glasses and cans ; the Yellows were no less boisterous, wore, indeed, even louder, but not so hearty ; and the customers at the \" Bear \" wore noisy, but only conversationally so. The two parties met there more ; the ground was neutral and argument more rife, but the frequenters of the hotel were of the better class, and what ever discussion went forward was carried on decorously and without heat. The general feeling seemed to be that there had been a much closer contest than was expected, that a"], [41, "A VERY ROUGH EVENING. 31 majority of no more than a hundred and fifty three was calculated to cloud the victory of the Blues with some degree of apprehension for a seat which had been deemed so secure. However, the Blues did not seem cast down, they took their victory as they found it, and wore quite satisfied. \" So long as they won,\" their leaders said, \" that w7as enough for them.\" Mr. Boldham had been the strongest man they would ever have arrayed agamst them, and no other would have got the votes he did. Meanwhile, in the small inns and beershops, the roughs of the town, the quarry men from the down, and the Dunstalne mob had collected and were singing, and dancing, and drinking, and fast working themselves up to the point where mischief begins in these matters. It was about eight o'clock, and still perfectly hght, when out of a beershop in the neighbourhood of the canal wharf, the favourite resort of the bargees who worked the fly-boats, which brought Avonham most of its London and Bristol merchandise, came pour ing a stream of half-tipsy roughs, who made a ring and surrounded a Dunstalne man and an Avonham man, wiio having differed as to"], [42, "32 TWO PARDONS. the number of times Nelson defeated the \" Hemperor Bonyparty,\" or the age of the \" Duke \" (there is but one Duke for West of England men), wore going to settle the matter in the good old English fashion.

From that time and from tins slight incident was Avonham's peace once more taken away. The Dunstalne men who had come into the tow-n that day wore all on the losing side, the party they had assisted had been defeated, and the tide of generosity which would have flowed so freely from win ners was trickling from losers much too slowiv and in much too scanty a volume to please the recipients, wTho had imagined, the wish beino-"], [43, "A VERY ROUGH EVENING. 33 father to the thought, that they wore coming into a land of rejoicing and plenty, Avhere, after assisting in beating the common foe, they would be bountifully regaled at the expense of the \" emancipated slaves wiio had long groaned beneath his yoke,\" to emote one of their most prominent orators ; but the Yellows in Avonham were not dispensing their favours as conquerors.

Presently, not con tented with alarming this portion of the town, they marched in fair order, but with immense noise, into the open space in front of the church, w-here they halted for a moment as if irresolute, and then raised deafening shouts of defiance of their enemies.

Foiled in tins attempt, the rioters next divided themselves into three portions, one continuing down the main street towards the bridge, one crossing into the churchyard to attack the houses beyond, and the third, w-hich we will follow, to commence the destruction in South Street. Acting under some instruc tions from someone in authority, they passed Mr. Bompas's house without injury, but smashed in the panes of the two next to it, and then, with loud shouts, crossed the road to the gate ofthe \" Coombes.\" It was known, of course, that the proprietor had no vote, but there seemed to be an understanding that"], [49, "A VERY' ROUGH EVENING. 39 something special was to be done here, for a louder outcry than had yet been made was raised as they halted before the gate.

Next, another peeping in cautiously to see wiiere the owner of this mysterious voice w7as concealed received a rap on the head which made him doubt for a minute or two whether he had a head left to rap. This was a chilling reception for the crowd, though a very warm one for those w7ho had sampled the fare winch the garrison ofthe \" Coombes \" w-as providing for them.

Entirely occupied with their own safety, they forgot all about the unfortunate prisoner, but left him behind in a most uncomfortable position, lying on the gravel path, with the heavy foot of the negro on his chest. \" Pick him up, Ned,\" said Bryceson, \" and take him into the house.

The rest of the combat was short, sharp and decisive. Twenty people, who had only before wanted leaders to attack the rioters, now joined the fray, and in a few minutes the largest of the three crowds, which were doing so much damage to the town, was dispersed.

The country journals had been full of praise of Mr. Bompas and the Mayor, both of whom, it was stated, had acted most courageously in the cause of order, and even the London papers had followed in the same strain, but with less diffuseness ; the little Marlshire tow-n had suddenly earned for itself a most unenvi able reputation ; really the quietest and most decorous of places, it had been hkened to a volcano full of smouldering and dangerous atoms, hable at any moment to burst forth in desolating riot and lay the country wraste. The young ladies waxed not a little indignant over this comparison, and lamented the town's disgrace, whilst they rejoiced in the praise of"], [66, "56 TAVO PARDONS. their sire. When that worthy \u2014 who stuck valiantly to his post beside his friend the Mayor till all the results ofthe row were investigated ; till the prominent rioters had been punished and the town freed from the military control which for two or three days was deemed neces sary, and indeed until Avonham, but for the glaziers, was quiet again \u2014 when Mr. Bompas joined his family in London he was received with open arms, not only as one who had escaped a great danger, but as one wiio had comported himself right valiantly therein. He found an auditory eager to hear all the news of the fray, and encouraged, unchecked and uninterrupted, he poured out his warlike tale. To do Mr. Bompas justice, he was not given to boasting of his own exploits ; he really and truly had amply deserved the encomium which Bryceson had passed upon him of being a \" brick,\" and had acted like the stout-hearted old fellow he was ; but he made no great account of what he had done, and rather slurred over those parts of the narrative relating to his OAArn share in the affray. He was full of com pliment towards his friend Sennett, and loud in praise of his two neighbours ; he described the repulse ofthe first attack on the \" Coombes \""], [67, "LUCY'S PARTNER. \u25a0r7 in glowing terms, and praised the coolness and courage of the young men to the skies ; and when he mentioned with the awe which the recollection of the affair still imposed, the Herculean feat Avhich Galbraith had performed with the unfortunate quarryman, his voca bulary of commendatory phrases gavre out, and he could only say with uplifted hands, \" There, my dears, it w-as simply marA-ellous. I could hardly credit my own eyes.\" One matter the good old fellow did not mention to his daughters, and that was the ignoble part played in the disturbance by Adolphus Carter. He had been sorely exercised in mind about that unfortunate youth. He had ridden over, in company Avith his crony Millard (for he did not wish to let the Mayor know of the matter whilst he was engaged in his official capacity in punishing other rioters), to the father of the culprit, and the trio had returned and called on Galbraith, who had condoled with the father and promised to take no more notice of the matter, so that Adolphus was again seated in his employer's office, a very sad and subdued young man indeed. Mr. Bompas, considering that sufficient had been done to humble his pupil, did not attempt"], [68, "58 TWO PARDONS. to lower him still farther in the eyes of his daughters. But, alas ! what human foresight can prevent a woman from imparting her ideas ? Mr. Bompas, w-ho concealed the story from his daughters, unfolded it to bis wife, and that good woman and mother hit the scent at once. She poured into the astonished ears of Mr. Bompas her elucidation of the mystery, and he was forced to accept it. Jealousy, and not politics, was at the bottom of the attack on South Street. \" My dear Abel,\" she said, \" of course it w-as nothing else ; you needn't go fishing for motives when they're on the surface ; he was jealous of those two young men coming to the house, though, to be sure, Mr. Bryceson has dropped in more often than Mr. Galbraith, and thought he could annoy them in that w-ay ; what a mischievous, ill-natured, spiteful little monkey he is.\" Ah, luckless Adolphus ! hitherto so eligible. It w-as an evil chance for you when this stranger came on your happy hunting ground, it was worse when you conceived your scheme of revenge and failed so ignominiously, but it was the worst of all when Mrs. Bompas took up arms against you. Papa may forgive,"], [69, "LUCY'S PARTNER. 59 papa may forget, but with Mamma arrayed against you, farewell to your hopes. Great was the surprise, and great the indig nation among the young ladies next morning, when Mrs. Bompas, at the breakfast table, told the tale of Carter's attack on the \" Coombes \" and his overthrow. Which pre dominated it wrould be difficult to say, probably the surprise. There was a feeling of pity as the father described to his daughters the shock which his conduct had given to his father ; there was a comic side to the picture, as he told them of the prisoner sobbing and grov-el ling on the floor before his stern captors, and a feeling of admiration for the forgiveness and leniency exhibited by Galbraith. When the girls were next together, in the absence of the old folks, they discussed the matter at length and with much spirit. Adelaide was specially wrarm on the unjustifiable attack on the \" Coombes,\" and declared that she would never speak to Carter again. \" A mean httle rascal,\" she said, stamping her pretty foot and looking the essence of scorn, \" what did he mean by it ?

I always thought there was something monkey ish in the way he pranked himself up, and chattered and skipped about ; I didn't give him credit for so much mischief though ; I did think he was harmless enough.\" \" Papa didn't say anything of Walter Rivers or Alfred Shelman in this matter. I wonder why these two heroes didn't distinguish them selves in putting down the riot ? \" said Louisa. \" I believe it was all the fault of those horrid Yellows,\" said Adelaide, \" and Alfred Shelman didn't want to interfere.\" She slightly flushed as she mentioned the name. \" And what about Walter Rivers, dear ? \" said Lucy, demurely. Adelaide flushed again. \" Papa didn't say"], [71, "LUCY'S PARTNER. 61 that either of them wras in the riot. He certainly said, though, that the Yellows began it \u2014 wiiy should the Blues have rioted ? They hadn't lost the election \u2014 Mr. Rivers might have tried to stop the disturbance but \" \" My dear,\" said Lucy, composedly, \" Walter Rivers is not at all adapted for hurling people over the moon, and I should think was extremely averse to be made a missile of.

I should like to take a peep at the place, though, and see the damage done.\" \" Yes,\" said Lucy, \" and we missed the officers too \u2014 not that it matters to you two spoons, but there might have been a chance for me.\" \" What do you mean by spoons ? \" \" Whom are you calling spoons, Lucy ? \" This from both the elder sisters.

Look at her iioav, Lou. Lucy, who ever taught you to wink ? You'd better not practise in London.\" Miss Lucy slowly opened the eye winch she had really closed in a very knowing manner at the end of her speech, and nodded her head very slowly and sagely two or three times, then she rose and clasping Adelaide round the wraist gave her a sisterly kiss, next turned to Louisa and did the same for her, all without speakmg a word. The two elder sisters turned very red, and \u2014 kissed each other. The sweet httle secret was out ; the thin veil was drawm aside by the hand of this laughing sister. That golden hour of hfe was begun which folloAvs the first confession of love. Then came papa, eager for sight-seeing, and with many plans for their holiday together. Papa wras in the best of humours. Papa was not at all afraid of the Regent Street shops. Papa was eager to please his pretty daughters, and ready to pull his purse-strings wide.

Nor wras he content to visit shops alone. It was only necessary to mention a place of amusement or exhibition, and the cheery old fellow trotted off to secure the best places and the cosiest conveyances to and from the show. \" My dear,\" he said to his wife, as they sat in the back of the box at the opera, and watched their three girls entranced by the music and spectacle, \" we do not visit the great metropolis every day, and it shall not be my fault if the girls, aye, and you, my dear, do not thoroughly enjoy yourselves. It is many years ago since we first beheld these scenes together.\" \" More than I care to remember ahvays, Abel.\" \" Well, my dear, they have been very happy ones for me. If our girls only get on as Avell as we have, they Avill have but little to complain of. At present they are Avith us, and we must make the most of them. We must not look forward to many more years of their society.\" \" I suppose not, Abel, if everyone is going"], [75, "LUCY'S PARTNER. 65 to admire them as much at home as abroad. If IVe seen one opera glass pointed this way I've seen fifty.\" \" My dear,\" said Mr. Bompas, gallantly, \" I noticed the same thing with their mother more than five-and-twenty years ago, in this identi cal place.\" Mrs. Bompas laughed, but appeared pleased with her faithful spouse. The girls, engrossed in the opera, had not caught their parents' con versation, and she felt safe in proceeding. \" Abel,\" she said, \" do you know I fancy Adelaide seems a good deal taken up with young Mr. Galbraith.\" \" Well, my dear, I haA-e observed symptoms of embarrassment when the gentleman's name has been mentioned, which would seem to confirm your idea.\" \" Well, Abel, wiiat do you think of it ? \" Upon my word, my dear, I have not given the matter attention enough to say what I really do think of it.\" \" I suppose Mr. Galbraith is well off ?

He seemed to scent the fragrant drink, and hear once more the ice tmkle on his goblet brim. \" Well, Abel,\" pursued the faithful mother, \" our girls are very good girls, and ought to marry wrell, and they're getting very much admired here in London. Young Mr. Goldings was most attentive to Adelaide the other even ing, and we go there to-morrow, you know. The dear girl won't want for strings to her bow, I can see. I'm very glad we've had this httle trip. It'll show them a little of the world, and let them know there are other places besides Avonham, and attractions out side their own home.\" Just then the crash of applause broke in at"], [77, "LUCY'S PARTNER. 67 the final chorus of the act, and conversation in the box became general. Mr. Bompas had, of course, correspondents in London, and for the most part these were men whose acquaintance and connection with him were of many years' standing. Many a cunning bottle of rare old wine made its appear ance in his honour and for his delectation in Inn chambers, in old-fashioned taverns, and in the barn-hke rooms of Bloomsbury houses, the cosiest, handsomest and roomiest in London, but now sadly fallen from their high estate, and given up to lodgers, mysterious agencies and money-lending offices dignified with the titles of banks, and having an evil saArour attached to most of their names. In those old houses twenty years ago were to be found dinners and cellars of irreproachable excellence, and hosts and diners hard to be equalled in these days of barrack hotels on the one hand and tardily repentant abstinence on the other. And the ladies were as hospitable as the men, as Mrs. Bompas well knew, and as her daughters were to experience now ; and heartiest of the hearty was the welcome extended to Mr. and Mrs. Bompas and his family by old Mr. Goldings, the head of the firm of family sohcitors, 22\u20142"], [78, "68 TWO PARDONS. Goldings and West, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, who inhabited a mansion in Russell Square. A dinner was, of course, the mode winch the sohcitor adopted whereby to entertain his friends ; and his womenfolk talked him over into giving a dance afterwards, and to both of these forms of entertainment our Avonham friends w-ere bidden. Two of the daughters of the host were school-fellows ofthe girls, and five merrier, brighter lassies could now-here be found. At dinner-time Adelaide went down with young Goldings, a West - Central Adonis, marked as highly eligible by many a fond mother. This young man was, as Mrs. Bompas obserA^ed, very much smitten by the charms of his pretty neighbour, to whom he paid great attention. Adelaide remembered him as a gawky boy of fifteen, home from Charterhouse for his holidays ; he was now a rather good looking young fellow of twenty-six, the junior partner of the firm, and with very pretty tea-table manners, which became him ex tremely well. Louisa fell to the lot of his brother, an Oxonian, of mild countenance and gentlemanly manners, w-ho wras to all outward appearances likely to develop into a model curate of the non-muscular Christian school,"], [79, "LUCY'S PARTNER. 69 and who consequently cherished in his heart Republican and free-thinking principles and opinions that would have made Thelwall shudder ; these were not produced at table, howrevrer. A father who is a family solicitor is touchy on tbe doctrine of equality, and Repub licans are mild in the presence of a tureen. Lucy's cavalier was the cheeriest of white haired old bachelors, who apologised for the temporary absence of a faA^ourite nephew, who would, he said, join the party after dinner, but avIio kept Miss Lucy quite as lively as her sisters seemed with their neighbours. The dinner w-as of the florid English order, the company the reA-erse of dull, the host seemed really glad to see his friends, and took wine with his guests in the cheery old-fashioned manner of bygone days that ought not, I thmk, to hav-e gone with them. Perhaps it survives somewhere, but it is drifting away on that sea of innovation which has washed away the country dance and the punch bowl \u2014 more's the pity. But here, in those days, the custom flourished, and no point of its jovial solemnity was omitted. The challenge, the stereotyped acceptance, the \" taking in,\" the beammg smile contemporaneous with the courtly bow over"], [80, "70 TWO PARDONS. the brimming glasses, and the simultaneous draughts, all was carried out that properly appertained to the good old rite. Mr. Mark ham, Lucy's partner, was especially selected as a mark for individual challenges and he never failed to respond. He Avas a source of great amusement to Lucy, wiio described him after wards as the dearest old beau she had ever met ; Mr. Trumphy was nothing to him. \" How long do you stay in London, Miss Lucy ? \" said he ; \" I'm not going to call you Miss Bompas, for two reasons : first of all, you're not Miss Bompas yet, and next the name isn't pretty enough for you.\" \" Thank you for the compliment, Mr. Mark ham. We shall stop, I hope, for another three weeks ; this is my first visit to London since I was at school here.\" \" Well, you must come out and see my place at Hampstead ; I shall get your father to bring you.\" \" I'm sure papa will be most happy.\" \" Goldings was telling me about his pluck at that dreadful riotous place of yours. I wonder you're not afraid to live there.\" \" Indeed, it's the quietest place in the world,\" said Lucy, standing up bravely for her native"], [81, "LUCY'S PARTNER. 71 town ; \"I can't make out hoAV it happened ; we've never had an election there, that I can remember, and I don't beheve it was our townspeople who made the riot at all.\" \" Quite right to stick up for your own town, Miss Lucy ; I've a nephew who has been there once, and he described it as a very quiet place.\" \" It's a very nice place.\" \" Many young gentlemen there ? \" \" Oh ! I don't know ; about the average number I believe. There is an average of male population in the country, isn't there ? I mean so many males to every female \u2014 two and a half or something of that sort.\" Mr. Markham laughed. \" Oh, there is, I assure you ; I learned something about it at school ; it's a horrid thing for the men, you know ; they can't all get married, of course.\" \" Some of them don't want to, Miss. I've kept away from it myself, and made room for someone else, you see.\" \" HaA^en't you ever been married, Mr. Mark- ham ? I should have thought you had been, you seem so nice.\" \" My turn to thank you for a compliment,"], [82, "72 TAVO PARDONS. now ; but I think you've got your statistics wrong somehow.\" \" How ? \" \" Why, if I don't mistake, there are more women than men in this country.\" '\" Good gracious, that's worse ; why there isn't a man apiece for all of us ; we can't all get married then ? \" \" Well, there are old maids as well as old bachelors, you know.\" \" Yes, but if there aren't any more of one than the other, that makes no difference to the rest, you know.\" \" Some men marry twice.\" \" So do some women \u2014 we're no better off even then.\" \" Well, Miss Lucy, I venture to prophesy that you needn't trouble about the scarcity of husbands. Even if there aren't enough to go round for everybody, there'll be someone com ing for you, I'm certam. Now, while you're thinking over the one that's coming \" \" There isn't one.\" \" How do you know ? \" \" Well\u2014 ho wr you tease \u2014 I mean I don't know him, and he hasn't begun to come yet \" \u2014 and Lucy looked the old gentleman"], [83, "LUCY'S PARTNER. 73 saucily in the face, and laughed merrily at him. \" Ah ! he'll come some day, perhaps to night, who knowrs ? I'm going to ask your father to take wine with me.\" Mr. Markham caught the eye of Mr. Bom pas without much difficulty, and the two handsome old fogies hob-nobbed with a courtly grace that would put to the blush scores of the youth of to-day \u2014 if youth blush nowa days, which is doubtful. When the ladies retired, and the gentlemen closed up to their host's end of the table, Mr. Bompas found himself next to Mr. Markham, w-ho complimented him first upon his daugh ters, and secondly upon his conduct at Avon ham. Before they joined the party upstairs, which was now numerous and ready for the dance, Mr. Bompas had settled a visit to Hampstead, and appointed a day for that purpose. On reaching the drawing-room, Mr. Mark ham made his way to Lucy, and laughingly asked her to pilot him through a quadrille. \" That is my only dance except ' Sir Roger,' \" said he, \" but I never like to admit that my dancing days are quite over.\""], [84, "74 TWO PARDONS. The first quadrille is a stately and solemn affair which a Bench of Bishops might dance with their Diocesan Secretaries' Aunts, and Mr. Markham went through it as a matter not to be irreAorently handled ; at the conclusion of it he gallantly escorted Lucy to a seat, and thanked her for the dance. At that moment a good-looking young fellow, wiio had just been shaking hands with Mrs. Goldings, came up, and, addressing the old gentleman as \" uncle,\" grasped his hand and shook it heartily. '\u2022 Ah, Fred, my boy, only just arrived ? \" said the old gentleman. \" Quite well ? That's right. Here, sir, let me introduce you to my first partner. Miss Lucy Bompas, this is my nephew, Mr. Frederick Markham. Now, my dear, I can leave you in the hands of a partner who can dance ; take care of Miss Bompas, Fred, and find her plenty of partners.\" Lucy and the young fellow were soon wiiirl ing round the room, and much as she had hked the uncle, it must be OAvned that her new partner was more to her liking, so far as dancing went. He put his name down three times on her card, introduced her to fresh partners, danced with her sisters and the"], [85, "LUCY'S PARTNER. 75 daughters of the house, but always returned to her as often as he got a chance. \" What capital dancers all you sisters are,\" said he, when, having man\u0153uvred them all to the same seat and got ices for them, he lounged by them, much envied by the rest of the young men in the room. \" It must come by nature, then,\" said Louisa, \" for we are terribly short of practice.\" \" Well, I must ask you to spare me another dance apiece after supper. Pray, are your cards all full ? \" \" You can have a polka, Mr. Markham,\" said Adelaide. \" I havo one here \u2014 number 16.\" \" Many thanks. Miss Louisa Bompas, have you anything to bestow in charity ? \" \" A schottische. Is that good enough for you? \" Beggars mustn't be choosers. Number 18, isn't it ? Please give me your card. Thank you very much. Miss Lucy Bompas, my uncle told me to take care of you, please give me the supper dance. I will forage for you like a Cossack.\" \" With pleasure, Mr. Markham. What are you doing with my card ? You have put dowai another after supper.\""], [86, "76 TAVO PARDONS. \" I asked for one after supper. Here comes someone to take you away. Don't forget the dance before supper.\" \" Lucy, my dear,\" said Adelaide, \" how many dances have you given that young man to-night ? Six, I believe. Lou, I think the next time this young woman ventures to read her sisters lessons about blushing we must ask to look at her programme.\" Presently the supper dance arrived, and, that over, supper itself, to which Lucy and her partner wont down in high spirits. Fred was as good as his word, and provided most skil fully for Lucy's wants. When at last he had leisure for conversation he said : \" You are only on a visit to London then, Miss Bompas ? \" \" That is all. We live a good way clown in the country in Maiishire.\" \" Maiishire ? Oh, indeed. I wTas dowrn there for a day not long ago, at Avonham.\" \" Oh, yes, I remember your uncle told me you were. Well, Avonham is wiiere we live.\" \" Is it, indeed ; how curious ! Why, one of my dearest friends lives there.\" \" Who is that ? \" \" Harry Galbraith. Do you know him ? \""], [87, "LUCY'S PARTNER. 77 \" Oh, yes, he's a neighbour of ours \u2014 and do you really know him, and is he a great friend of yours ? How singular. Do you know the whole town is just dying to know all about him. We used to call him the hermit, and the recluse, and all sorts of names until we knew him and his friend Mr. Bryceson.\" \" Walter Bryceson is another of my friends.\" \" Fancy that now.\" \" And there aren't two finer or better fellows in the world. We wore together for many years in America. It was to visit Harry that I went to Avonham. We all dined at the hotel there, and a capital time we had.\" \" I remember the time you came.

He has done business with him : sold him a house and some land for a lady wiiose affairs papa manages. Papa says Mr. Galbraith and Mr. Bryceson behaved splendidly the other day in a riot at Avonham. Do you know Mr. Galbraith threw a man right o\\or some people's heads ? He must be very strong.\" \" He's the strongest man I ever met in my"], [88, "78 TWO PARDONS. hfe, and as brave as a lion. It was not the first row Harry and Walter have been shoulder to shoulder in. We've seen some queer tilings together, Miss Lucy. Do you know I'm so glad you livo at Avonham. I shall have a chance of seeing you again.\" \" We shall be vory glad, I'm sure,\" said Lucy, casting down her eyes. \" I shall make great use of Harry now,\" said Markham, laughing, \" now I've a real excuse for rmmmg down.\" He lowered his voice and, bending forward, added, \" I can kill two birds with one stone.\" The rest of the night wras very sweet to Lucy. Her programme was, as Louisa told her afterwards, \" a terrible tell-tale ; \" and she unblushingly sat out a dance with Fred hi the conservatory whilst the would-be partner whose name figured on the programme was wildly hunting for her. Old Mr. Markham, to whom she gave \" Sir Roger,\" wras very funny OAor her system of aAorages and her statistics ; her sisters very facetious in the carriage going home ; that last hand pressure was indeed sentimental, Adelaide declared ; and even mamma had her little joke. But the two elder sisters were vastly surprised"], [89, "LUCY'S PARTNER. 79 when Lucy told them of the old friendship existing between young Markham and their two Avonham neighbours. In due time, next day, arrived Mr. Markham and his nephew \u2014 \" The ball's fair partner to behold, And humbly hope she caught no cold,' as the old gentleman quoted. The two old fellows made friends very rapidly, and the young people were very merry. With a mis chievous hint or two Lucy contrived to give Fred some inkling of the impression his two friends had made on the hearts of her sisters, and he discoursed in glowing terms of both of them. He gave some bright sketches of their hfe abroad, and from him the Bompas family learned many things of the two strangers who had pitched their tents in Avonham. Mrs. Bompas was gratified to learn that both Gal braith and Bryceson were woalthy ; not really mercenary or worldly, she wras yet put greatly at her ease by learning that in addition to the fortune made in California, each had inherited family property ; and Fred spoke so eloquently of the bravery, modesty and large-heartedness of Galbraith and of the unfailing good humour and sterhng good qualities of Bryceson, that"], [90, "80 TAAO PARDONS. Adelaide and Louisa wore delighted. When the two took their leavo of the country family, and the girls were again alone, Louisa said : \" Lucy, your admirer is very nice ; he's a cleAor man, I'm sure, and I heard his uncle tell papa that he was the best of good fellows to his old father and to him, and he talks wonderfully well \u2014 doesn't he, Addie ? \" \" Capitally,\" said Adelaide. \" I hke him very much.\" \" Well, his subject was interesting to you two turtle-doves,\" said Lucy. \" Wait till he talks about you, my dear,\" said Adelaide, \" you'll be more interested then.

When I had tracked her down to this quiet httle English town, where no one would haA-e dreamed of finding her unless they had traced her step by step as I did, I took the very best means of concealing from her any suspicion, any thought, of who I might be, by acting in what, when the matter is all over, people will say was the most idiotic and short-sighted manner pos sible.\" \"That was ?\" \" Buying property of her \u2014 and just see how curiously things turn out.

Since the new-s of his brother being ahve, and the hopeful view taken of his condition by their old leader, these moods had disappeared, and he was now look ing forward to their meeting with a keen joy scarcely concealed under the calm and imper turbable manner of his communication Avith the outward world.

It was, however, a very merry party that assembled at Fairlawn on the following day ; needless to say that the ladies looked charm ing, that old Markham was boisterously hos pitable, and that the affair was not suffered to drag for lack of light-heartedness. The day was one of those bright September ones that early autumn brings, as if to show how bright she can be, and that her first resplendent dress becomes her as much as the many-tinted robe she will don wffien her longer hfe has brought the shortening days ; and the evening had that calm sweet influence that follows a rosy, flaming September sunset, as the sweet voice of the soprano follows the crashing chorus of"], [121, "A TRIPLE ALLIANCE. 111 the men.

Not a very long time passed before Fred and Lucy began to speak in tones that were lower and lower, though no one was there to listen, and the pauses between the words wore longer and longer, and the words sweeter and swoeter, till presently the dainty waist wras encircled, the dainty fingers pressed, the pouting lips kissed, and the fair head drawn down till it rested close to the faithful heart.

Down by the lake Galbraith and Adelaide strolled and talked in much the same manner as the other two couples. The heart of the frank girl went out to meet the great love of this man, so bravo, so strong and so true. When the tender question had been asked and answored, when heart had beaten against heart, and hp pressed lip, then Adelaide had to begin to bear her burden. \" You know I am going away, dearest, don't you ? \" \" Oh, Harry ! so soon ? \" \" My darling, it must be so, and I must tell you why ; come, now, let us try whether you can keep a secret.\" And then he told her aU. Few indeed have been the gnis wrho havo had to share in such a secret or to hear such a tale.

He is very fond of you. Oh, Harry, I am so happy. But I wish you weren't going away. Oh, here are Lou and Lucy.\" Louisa and Lucy, looking most demure and unconscious, were standing at the open window talking to Mr. Markham as uncon cernedly as if being engaged were a daily ex perience. Adelaide joined the group, looking as demure as either of her sisters. The old gentleman's eyes twinkled. \" Have you seen your mamma, my dear ? I fancy she has gone out to look for you. Mr. Bompas, let us go and find some of these young men and smoke a cigar with them.\" When the old boys had left the room there was a short silence, during w7hich none of the sisters ventured to look at one another. At last Lucy spoke in a solemn tone. \" Sisters,\" she said in a mock-tragedy tone, \" I have a confession to make.\" \" Well, dear,\" from the two others."], [129, "A TRIPLE ALLIANCE. 119 \" I confess to \u2014 haAing wasted a great deal of time in church.\" \" What are you talking about, Lucy ? \" \" Silence, Addie.

You see marriage is an honourable estate and all that, but it wrenches out some good strong roots at times when it transplants young people.

Before Galbraith took up his abode in Avon ham, the inhabitants of that quiet town had held somewhat singular ideas respecting the negro race, and, as opinions in Avonham became, by dint of long holding, elevated and exalted to the dignity of creeds, it was some what of a shock to find that the preconceived notions and beliefs which had passed current for so many years were exploded, or, even in the most conservative of minds, considerably modified after personal inspection and study of the specimen of the children of Ham now residing there. Mr. Timothy Rapsey was wont to speak of himself as a student of human nature. With curiosity the mainspring of his actions, and its gratification the business of his life, simple and almost infantile in his manners, he resembled a chUd in nothing so much as in the employ ment of that characteristic of infancy, \" taking"], [132, "122 TAVO PARDONS. a deal of notice.\" He had the faculty of recep tion in no ordinary degree ; had he possessed that of retention in the same ratio he would haA-e been a Maiishire Solon ; as it was, although tolerated, and not refused the honour of posing as one of the worthies and authorities of the place, he was forced to admit to himself that he had missed the dignity, the importance, and the gravity which marked the fathers of the town, and distinguished them from the common herd. Yet the town could have better spared a better man than gossiping, inquisitive, prying but amusing Timothy Rapsey, w-ho, just at this period of our tale, was seized with a burning desire to culth-ate the acquaintance of Galbraith's negro servant, ostensibly, as he tried to assure himseff, with a view of increas ing his ethnological knowledge, reaUy, as his mind told him, to gratify his curiosity respect ing the inmates of a house which he knew not how to honestly enter and which was now in the charge of Ned. And to know that Gal braith had temporarily Aracated his house was not, in Timothy's eyes at least, to know enough, he wished to acquaint himself why he had gone and where he had gone to. Whilst he Avas casting about in his mind for"], [133, "NED'S HOSPITALITY AND WHAT CAME OF IT. 123 the best means of arriving at this desired end, and indeed he was not the only Avonhamite who was curious on the subject, it happened that the opportunity of gaining a footing with Ned came about unexpectedly and with scarcely much of his own seeking. It chanced one morning, as he was passing the front gate of the \" Coombes,\" that its janitor, for so he considered him, was standing at the top of the steps engaged in paying the carrier, who had just dehvered a parcel. Timothy greeted the negro with effusion and paused to have a chat with him, partly to further the great end he had in view, and partly to find out what had that morning been left at the house. To his great gratification Ned entered readily into conversation, and \u2014 the carrier having driven away \u2014 to his still greater glee, after remarking that the day was hot for the time of year and that he felt very thirsty, the negro invited him to enter and refresh himself, promising him that he would provide him something grateful and cooling. When Timothy found himself fairly inside the mysterious house \u2014 for the unknown is always the mysterious to httle minds \u2014 he was fairly beside himself with joy. Everything"], [134, "124 TWO PARDONS. was new to him, for he had never visited the house in Major Currie's time, and whilst Ned was concerned about the preparation of the drinks, he peered and pried into evory corner of the room. Books, pictures, weapons, strange skins and savage trophies were all reviewed and commented on in turn, and a glittering mass of iron pyrites and mica which Ned produced from a drawer and gravely assured him was a nugget of pure gold fairly made him gasp. Such a cigar as the little man found between his lips in a few7 minutes had never come within his ken, certainly never found its w-ay to his mouth, and the first sensation which came over him as he drew Ned's seductive mixed drink through the first hollow straw he had used since his school days, when he had taken half-hohday draughts from the Avon by means of a similar apparatus, wras akin to his notions of paradise itself.

And under the combined influence of good spirits, good cigars, and Ned's wonderful mix tures, the heart of the little man opened wide, and with it his mouth. He found as an additional pleasure that the negro made a most excellent listener, that he replied to his local wit with appreciative chuckles and grins, and even with occasional African cachimiations, which not only gratified, but amused him vory much. The questions, too, which Ned inter polated now and then provod to the happy little chatterer how much his companion was interested in his comorsation, and he laid himseff out to repay, with local hitelhgence and gossip, the sumptuous hospitality he had received at the hands of his host. He gave a description of the principal magnates of the town and their families, considerably height ened and full of local colour. He was not deterred now, hi his mention of Mrs. Stanhope, by the restraining presence of Mrs. Phiniffer, and he did not spare his opinion as to the presumed relations between her and the two individuals whom Avonham had set down as her admirers.

It was uncertain which of them Mr. Adolphus Carter was about to be engaged to, he said. He had questioned Mr. Carter on the subject chaffingly only yesterday, and, strange to say, had met with something like a rebuff ; the tempers of young men on those points, he said, knowingly, were uncertain, but from the young man's important manner he had reason to beheve it would soon be a well-known matter. Ned grinned hugely at the profound know ledge of human nature and local matters combined displayed in this remark, and paid Timothy a compliment on his shrewdness, which pleased him highly. \" ReaUy,\" he thought to himself, \" the negro race has been greatly underrated. This man appreciates me a great deal more than half the people in Avonham, w7ho call themsehos Christians.\" At this juncture Ned changed the subject to the recent election, and asked Timothy whether Carter had had any connection with it. vol. ii. 26"], [140, "130 TWO PARDONS. Mr. Rapsey believed that Adolphus was very friendly with Alfred Shelman, and that possibly he might have rendered him some service in the matter, but that having regard to his position at Mr. Bompas's, and the fact that the latter had taken no part in it, he did not think it probable. Ned proposed another nice cool Sangaree \u2014 or would Mas'r Rapsey hke to taste some real Bourbon w7hisky ; there was nothing like it anywhere else in England, he said. Mr. Rapsey jovially assented, and added to his potations a Bourbon straight. In about half-an-hour Timothy discovered that he was mixing up the names of a good many of the people of whom he had been talking, and he admired more than ever the great interest evinced in his conversation \u2014 shown chiefly by the gentle way in which he was every now and again led back into the right train of thought and coherent speech by the listener \u2014 he became confidential about the riot, and waxed deeply indignant about the attack on the \" Coombes.\" Soon, he found \u2014 with much the same sort of surprise with which Monk Schwartz or Roger Bacon discovered gunpowder to be explosive \u2014 that"], [141, "NED'S HOSPITALITY AND WHAT CAME OF IT. 131 Adolphus Carter's name was being connected with the affair, and that he was passing from a feeling of utter incredulity about his share in the matter to a state of virtuous wrath against him for injuring an inoffensive stranger. He next became conscious that he was, somehow, taking vast pains to connect Carter with Shelman and Shelman with the outbreak ; and, finally, that whatever informa tion he had, respecting either of the two young men, was being heartily and effusively placed at the disposal of his dear friend, Mr. Edward \u2014 who had, he averred, been most shamefuUy treated \u2014 but how, he was not quite sure.

To tell the truth Alfred Shelman was supremely uncomfortable about the news his visitor had to give him. It wras true that the riot had broken out hi a great measure from an accidental circumstance, but there had been much hi it that had been his doing, and it had been only by the employment of a good deal of tact and some considerable amount of money too that he had been able to close the mouths of two or three of the moving spirits among the rioters who had been com- mitted to prison for their share in the work, and now, if the news wore hi Rapsey's mouth, he said to himself, it might as woll be in the"], [147, "NED'S HOSPITALITY AND WHAT CAME OF IT. 137 towrn crier's ; so it wras with more inward fear than he cared to acknowledge that he hstened to Carter's narration of his interview with Timothy. That drink-valiant httle man, returning from the \" Bear,\" slightly the worse for his modest potations, taken on top of Edward's morning offerings, had encountered Carter, who was also homeward bound. Assuming an ah which he intended to be dignified, he had, without mentioning the source of his intelli- gence, terrified Adolphus by the information that he knew aU about the source of the riot and the attack on Galbraith's house. In his sober moments, Timothy would never have ventured to mention Shehnan's name, nor had he any real knowledge that the latter had been concerned, but the two names were jingling together in his brain, and it became impos- sible to separate them. In common with most chatterboxes possessed of scanty information, Mr. Rapsey drew liberally on his own imagina- tion, and, partly aided by the ejaculations and exculpations of the astonished and terrified Carter, and partly by one or two lucky hits, he succeeded in endowing that nervous youth with a conviction that his crime and folly and"], [148, "138 TAVO PARDONS. that of his associate were thoroughly known to Timothy, who, in some A-ague and undefined manner, meant to exact a stern penalty from each of them for it. Carter had barely enough presence of mind to extract from the proposed avenger his promise that he would see him on the and that he would take no steps meanwhile. Such was the story which he now related to Shelman, who seemed almost as disturbed as himself. A'arious means of securing their safety were discussed at the sitthig, but two alone seemed to remain for choice : either to bribe the httle man to silence or to frighten him into retrac tion. It is needless to say that it was Carter who suggested the former method, but it met with Shehnan's opposition. \" The httle beggar's got plenty of money for himself,\" said he ; \"he banks with us, and I know- his affairs to a penny. He's had about three hundred a year \u2014 of course I'm telling this to you confidentially as we're in the mud together \u2014 ever since he was twenty-one, and although he's neA-er done a stroke of work since he sold his business, he has neAor been extravagant hi anything, and hasn't lived up"], [149, "NED'S HOSPITALITY AND WHAT CAME OF IT. 139 to more than hah his income. He's not at all greedy for money, for he could get a good deal better interest in twenty safe things than we pay him on his deposit account, and a good many people would open their eyes if they knew how much that was ; no, money in this case isn't any good, strange to say, and you're never safe in the hands of a man you bribe ; we must ride the high horse, Carter, and frighten him.\" \" How7 do you propose to do it ? \" \" Send him a lawyer's letter, threatening an action for slander.\" \" That'U frighten him. AVhom will you get to do it : not Sennett ? \" \" Sennett \u2014 nonsense ! There are more law yers in the world than Sennett. Leave that to me. If he broaches the matter again, defy him, dare him to prove his words, and before he has time to take any steps, we'll be down upon him with our threat of action.\" \" Yes,\" said Carter, doubtfully, \" I'll see him at once.\" \" No, no,\" said Shelman, \" don't go a yard out of your way ; indeed, try if you can to postpone any interview, without, of course, ap pearing to wish to avoid him. Together with"], [150, "140 TAVO PARDONS. the lawyer's letter he'll get one from the Bank calling on him to withdraw his account, and in two days we'll have him on his knees.\" AAith this pleasing hope the two parted. As frequently happens when persons give reproofs and assume indignation under spirit uous influences, Air. Timothy Rapsey had no intention, when he woke on the morning after he had poured out his w7rath on Adolphus Carter, of carrying the matter any farther ; without having forgotten the occurrence, he had done Avith it and put it aside. On the third morning after his visit to Ned, on de scending the street, he had just ghon the old postman his customary morning salutation, w7hen that worthy, to his surprise, stopped him as he w-as passing. \" Hold on a minute, Air. Rapsey ; I've got two letters for 'ee.\" \" For me ? \" said Timothy ; \" two letters ! Why, dear me, Avhoever can they be from ? \" \" Ah, that's moor than I do knaw,\" said the postman, grinning, \" but here they be.\" Air. Rapsey took the letters, and, adjusting his spectacles to his nose, essayed to open them. He was awkAvard at it though, with one letter tucked under his arm, and the wind"], [151, "NED'S HOSPITALITY AND AVHAT CAME OF IT. 141 was too high for comfortable reading ; so, placing both epistles in his pocket, he betook himseff home to peruse them in comfort. The first that presented itself to his aston ished gaze was couched in these, to him, incomprehensible words : \" 84, Lincoln's Inn Fields, \" London. \" Sir, \u2014 AVe are instructed by our chent, Mr. Alfred Shelman, to enter an action against you for slander, in which our client lays his damages at one thousand pounds. \" The slander imputed consists in an accu sation which you have thought fit to brmg against Air. Shelman, to the effect that he had conspired with another person to w7reck and destroy, or cause to be so destroyed and wrecked, a certain dwelling-house, situate hi Avonham, and caUed ' The Coombes.' \" AVe shaU be glad to be favoured with the name of the solicitor w7ho will act for you in this matter. \" We are, Sh, \" Your obedient servants, \" Blackwell, Ridley and Groves.\""], [152, "142 TWO PARDONS. To say that Timothy Rapsey was scared by the letter would be insufficient ; he was almost paralysed with terror. He read the missive twice and groaned over it dismally for some minutes, with the cold sweat of fear pouring from him. After some time, he remembered that there was another. He opened this, and read as follows : \" Avonham Bank . \" Sir, \u2014 We have to request that you will have the goodness to withdraw both your cur rent and deposit accounts from this Bank, as we must decline any further transactions with you. \" AVe are, Sir, \" Your obedient servants, \" BOLDHAM, HUMBERSTONE, BOLDHAM AND Co. \" Goodness gracious me,\" moaned poor Timothy ; \" whatever shaU I do ? \" He did the very last thing that his two would be persecutors could have imaghied. He sat for a few minutes to collect himself, and then, with a beating heart and a pale face, betook himself to the \" Coombes.\""], [153, "NED'S HOSPITALITY AND WHAT CAME OF IT. 143 It is a dangerous thing to over-terrify a weak man. Dangerous for the actor as well as the agent. The woak man is apt naturaUy to look for help, and he goes to the strongest help he knows of. In place of seeking the advice of his friend Sennett, Rapsey determined to find Galbraith and lay his trouble before him. His house was the cause of the trouble, he argued, and in his house had he conceived the unlucky notion which had led him into this scrape. Mr. Adolphus Carter happened to catch sight of the poor terrified httle man, as with trem bling hmbs and bloodless face he went past Air. Bompas's office window in South Street. It was a welcome spectacle to him, for Bryceson had, a few minutes before, driven past with a stranger by his side, and Mr. Raraty seated at the back of the dog-cart. What a funk the httle man looked in to be sure, thought Adol phus as Timothy passed down the street. This would teach him not to interfere with his supe riors another time. His manner would be a httle more respectful the next time they met. Adolphus was doubled up with laughter ; he went to the door to gaze after him. But when he reached the step aU trace of"], [154, "144 TWO PARDONS. laughter vanished out of Iris face in an instant, and he grew pale in his turn. \" Good gracious, what's he going in at the gate of the ' Coombes ' for ? \" said he to him self. Mr. Carter had not forgotten that Shelman knew- absolutely nothing of his own capture, release, and pardon by Galbraith, and a horrible thought stole ovor him that Rapsey did know of it and would use the fact as a woapon of defence against Shelman. And they had not counted on resistance either. Adolphus w-ent back to his desk, smiling no longer. 6 Meanwhile, Rapsey had entered the gate and wras tottering along the path to the door which he had entered so joyfully and quitted so jovially on the occasion of his last visit. At the door was Bryceson, talking to a stranger. \" Good morning, sir,\" said he timidly, and his voice sounded hollow and faint, and unlike his own in his ears. \" Good morning, Air. Rapsey,\" said Bryceson cheerily ; \" what brings you this way ? AATiat can we do for you ? \" \" I was wishful, if you please, sir,\" said poor"], [155, "NED'S HOSPITALITY, AND AVHAT CAME OF IT. 145 Timothy, \" to speak to Mr. Edward, if I might take the liberty.\" The terrified little man w7as quite beaten down by his trouble. \" Ned has just gone OAor to Avonham Road for some luggage and things,\" said Bryceson. \" Can I do anything for you till he returns ? \" \" I don't know, sir,\" said Timothy, with his eyes fixed and staring. \" I'm hi \u2014 in great trouble, sir \u2014 see Mr. Galbraith, sh \u2014 these \u2014 letters \" And with these wandering words, and with a vain effort to take the letters from his pocket, he feU forward, fainting, into Bryceson's strong arms. That afternoon, as Adolphus Carter was. preparing to leaAO the office, a note was handed to him by one of the ostlers of the \" Bear.\" He opened it and read : \" Bear Hotel, A'ham. \" Dear Sir, \u2014 As I hear Mr. Bompas is absent from* home, may I request an hiterview with you here at your earhest convenience, on important business ? \u2014 Yours truly, \" Fredk.

Alarkham was shown upstairs to a private room. He w7aited alone for a minute or two, and then, the door opening, the stranger whom he had seen that morning seated by Bryceson's side entered, foUowed by Bryceson himself. For the second time that day Adolphus turned pale, and his paUor was not diminished when Bryceson locked the door, and, pointing to a chair, said sternly : \" Sit down, Air. Carter. I thought we had done with you the other night, but it appears not.\" Adolphus Carter sat down and waited eA-ents in a state of agitation almost as great as that of his victim Timothy Rapsey."], [157, "CHAPTER VII. THE MAKINGS OF A VERY PRETTY QUARREL. In very truth the present position of Air. Adolphus Carter was an unenviable one, and he mentaUy cursed his fate for having led him a second time into a contest with the inmates of the \" Coombes.\" He sat white and shiver ing, looking first at Bryceson, who was leisurely sorting over a few papers which he had taken from his pocket, and then at Markham, who stood regarding him gravely and sternly. Adolphus almost wished himself back in the dining - room at the \" Coombes,\" with the negro's strong grip on his arm. There is a certain feeling which comes over the mind of a mean man when he is confronted with courage, integrity and rectitude of pur pose, which is, perhaps, among the most painful of all the experiences that can happen to wrong doers. That feeling is not one of hatred so much as of envy, not so much of nialice as of admiration. Sitting there, awaiting his fate, 27\u20142"], [158, "148 TAVO PARDONS. eagerly expectant of the opening words of a speech and conversation the result of which he could not foresee, he was as sincere an admirer of the two young men wiio were about to apply the torture to him as though he had been their oldest friend. AATiat would he not give to be able to stand in their position ? How could he have been so mad \u2014 he, a puny, weak-headed frivolous fool, as he told himself he was \u2014 as to engage in a contest with men who seemed to him, as he thought of his ow7n unworthmess, hke beings of a different sphere ? Bryceson sorted his papers for a couple of minutes, and selecting three from them, laid them on the table and placed the others hi his pocket-book ; he then turned to Carter and, speaking as though the matter in hand were an ordinary business one, said : \" Air. Carter, you know7, of course, some thing of legal matters \u2014 of ordinary eAoryday legal matters, I mean ? \" \" Yes,\" said Carter, in a tone as brisk as he could assume ; he would make what fight he could of it, he told himseU. \" You know what a power of attorney is ? \" \" Oh, yes.\" \" This,\" said Bryceson, handing him the"], [159, "THE MAKINGS OF A VERY PRETTY QUARREL. 149 topmost of the three selected papers, \" as you will see, is a power of attorney from my friend, Mr. Henry Galbraith, authorising me to act in aU matters for him during his absence.\" Carter took the document handed to him and glanced over it, principally because it was handed to him, and he had no other course. \" Thank you, Air. Bryceson,\" said he, re turning it. \" I should have acted in this affair myself,\" said Bryceson, \" even if I had not held this authority, but you will understand that as the matter stands I am now proceeding on behalf of my friend Air. Galbraith ; not from any desire to avoid any responsibility, but because I am sine it is what my friend would have wished.\" Adolphus inclined his head, having no Avords with which to reply. \" So much for the first paper, which I showed you as a matter of form,\" said Bryce son, \" now for the second. Do you know a firm of solicitors in London named Blackwell, Ridley and Groves ? \" \" No.\" Bryceson and Markham exchanged glances. \" Do you know anything of this letter ? \""], [160, "150 TWO PARDONS. said Bryceson, handing him the document which had so terrified Timothy Rapsey. The letter trembled in Carter's hands, as he read it. He felt strong indignation against Shelman for his utter want of tact hi this action. This was a pretty way of bringing Timothy Rapsey to his knees in two days. The letter took a long time in reading, short as it was ; the two friends remained silent, and Air. Carter was uninterrupted ; his eyes were on the words, but after his first reading of them he saw them not ; he saw through them the angry brow of Shelman, the stern set features of Galbraith, the righteous wrath of Air. Bompas, his father's grief- stricken face and his mother's anxious eyes. The silence grew painful to hini, but he dared not break it. Faintly in the street he could hear Prosser, the bellman and crier, calling out some announcement ; he wondered Avhat it was ; the clock above his head he noticed had a loud tick and a shght irregularity in it ; they had a clock at home something like it. Downstairs somebody laughed hi the bar parlour ; he felt angry with him for indulging in unseemly mirth ; how could anyone laugh at such a time ?"], [161, "THE MAKINGS OF A VERY PRETTY QUARREL. 151 At last he laid the letter down on the table. \" I have never seen it before,\" he said. \" You misunderstand my question,\" said Bryceson, quietly ; \"I asked you whether you know anything of it. Do you ? \" For a moment or two Carter hesitated, but he felt the game was up ; he had played bad cards badly, and the odds were aU one way. \" I knew it was going to be sent,\" he said. \"Thank you,\" said Bryceson; \"now we come to the last of the papers I have to show you just now.\" He took the Bank letter and handed it to Carter. \" D j you know anything of that ? \" Hesitation was of no use now. \" I knew that was going to be sent, too,\" he said, and felt that he had indeed \" burned his ships.\" \" It is a holograph, you will observe,\" said Bryceson. \" Alay I enquire whether you know the handwriting ? \" \" I do,\" said Carter. \" Will you teU me whose handwriting it is ? \" \" Mr. Alfred Shehnan's.\" \" This other letter, of course, was sent at Mr. Shehnan's instigation ? \""], [162, "152 TWO PARDONS. \" It was.\" \" It mentions an accusation of conspiracy with another person ; did you notice that. \" Yes,\" said Carter faintly, for he felt that the crisis w-as coming now. \" I wanted to draw your attention to that for a special reason,\" said Bryceson ; \" and now, Mr. Carter, I will tell you what you are perhaps a little curious to know, and that is how those last two papers came into my pos- session.\" Carter murmured something inarticulate. \" Air. Rapsey,\" said Bryceson, looking steadily at Carter, wiio quailed before his gaze, \" of whom I know- nothing whatever beyond what little I havo seen of him about the town during my stay here, came to my friend's house, w-hich I am at present occupying, this morning to see Air. Galbraith's servant, whom I daresay you remember.\" \" AVould he evor forget him ? \" Carter thought. \" Air. Rapsey,\" Bryceson went on, \" seemed in trouble, and proved to be very much upset by the receipt of these two letters. He could only account for them hi one way, and that was this. He and Edward had been gossiping"], [163, "THE MAKINGS OF A VERY PRETTY QUARREL. 153 together a few days previously, and amongst other topics they hit upon a certain httle episode of the night of the election day, which I have no doubt you also remember.

Rapsey, of course, was not aware of this ; he went to Edward simply because the conversation to which, as I say, he attri butes these letters, occurred between them. Very fortunately I happened to be in Avonham, having arrived here this morning, and have taken the matter in hand. This is the reason of this meeting tins afternoon. You wiU excuse, under the circumstances, the httle scheme by which I was able to ensure your presence here, and now haAing given you an account of the matter so far, wo will, if you please, proceed to real business.\" Fred Markham, as if to mark that a point in the negotiations had been reached, took a chair and seated himself astride of it with his arms resting on the back. \" That business, Mr. Carter,\" pursued Bryceson, still in the calm and quiet tone which he had preserAod from the commence ment of the interview, \" may be very much simplified by you.

Carter quitted the house burning with a double rage \u2014 rage against both Bryceson and Shelman. By one he had been made a cats paw, by the other he had been treated as a cur. He felt that Bryceson must have been sure all along that he would divulge at once the name of his principal, and that he would betray him the moment pressure w7as put upon him. He despised himself for being a coward, but he did not blame himself. He even caught at the fact of his rage against Shelman as some sort of excuse for his having betrayed him to his enemies. But, over and over again, as he went on his way, he w7as vowing vengeance against all those wiioni he con sidered arrayed against him. Not only against Bryceson for having brought him to bay, and wrested his secret from him, but against Galbraith for having come to Avonham at aU, against the Bompas family for having tolerated him, against Shelman for having attempted to interfere with him, against Edward for his suspicions, and Rapsey for his garruhty ; he inveighed against them all. One thing he had made up his mind to do, and that was to have"], [178, "168 TWO PARDONS. it out with Air. Alfred Shelman as soon as possible. He burst in upon that gentleman that evening as he was sitthig at home, and broke into a storm of reproach and invective, winch alarmed and surprised Shelman not a httle. Incoherently he poured out upon him a jere- miad respecting their scheme, mixed with bitter lamentations for his own position, and warnings to him to avoid the fate wffiich he had met. Shehnan's wras not the temper to allow him to sit patiently under such an outbreak. \" Sit down, curse you ! \" he shouted, \" have you gone mad, Carter ? Either give me a sensible account of what has happened, or stop your gibbering and get out ! \" In presence of his ally Carter wras a coward indeed. The idea that had possessed him after leaving the \" Bear \" had been first to up braid Shelman and next to terrify him by an account of what he himself had had to undergo at the hands of the two men who had just put him on the rack. But Shelman was not a coward. He rose to the difficulty, and seeing plainly that his comrade had been terrified into divulging their secret, was determined to"], [179, "THE MAKINGS OF A VERY PRETTY' QUARREL. 169 extract from him the extent of his confession hi order that he might frame some plan whereby he could avoid the consequences of his own indiscretion and the cowardice of his partner. Carter, as may be supposed, acted as a woak mind wiU act when confronted with a stronger one ; he partially recovered his senses, and putting a strong restraint upon himself was able to let Shelman know ap- proximately how matters stood. It was Shel- man's turn to get angry now ; he fairly boiled OAor with rage and chagrin. For the third time that day his cowardly associate was panic-stricken ; he raved at him for his stu- pidity, his bungling and his cowardice ; he cursed Rapsey for his tale-bearing, and the very existence of Galbraith, Bryceson, and the opposite pohtical party were sufficient ground for him to indulge in a torrent of vituperation against them. The way in which he vowed vengeance against them almost persuaded Carter that he was on the strong side after all, and that this shouting, bullying, cursing friend of his was a match for his opponents yet. But all his raving and raging, though it relieved him, could not conceal from Shelman"], [180, "170 TWO PARDONS. the fact that he had been outwitted, and that his position was serious. He had compromised himself in several ways. He knew, though no one else did, the part he had taken after the election, and how much of the riot was due to him ; that was bad enough by itself. In addition to that, he had, on his own re sponsibility, and without the knowledge of his uncle, who was away from the town, ordered the closing of the accounts of a Aory good Bank customer, not anticipating for a moment that the said closing of accounts would evor be likely to occur, and he had threatened with an action for slander a man, who, instead of flinging himself at his feet and praying for mercy, had discovered, through his very Aveak ness, friends who not only wore prepared to resist him vigorously, but were hi possession of a fact, winch of itself justified the so-called slander. His pohtical standing in Avonham and his position as a partner in the Bank seemed alike imperilled and threatened by those whom he most hated and despised. It is probable that the dreams of both Car ter and Shelman wore troubled that night ; but at any rate the night watches brought consideration, and Shelman had something"], [181, "THE MAKINGS OF A VERY PRETTY QUARREL. 171 hke a plan in his head when morning came. He had reflected that it wras most probable that Bryceson had obtained the information respecting the riot simply with a view to use it as a means of defending Timothy Rapsey from the consequences of an action. Well, the action would not be brought, of course, and the necessity for using the information having passed avvay, it w7as probable that it would not be used. He would see Rapsey himself at his house, and must make up his mind to eat a httle humble pie before him ; his influence surely had not aU faded in the httle man's eyes, and a httle concession and condescension would work marvels with Tim othy. He would put the action and the Bank affair straight, and thus remove two great stumbling blocks out of his way ; and with respect to other matters, he must take the risk. Only, he told himself, and his blustering of the night before had not blinded his eyes to the fact, he must be careful how he went to work, either now or at any future time, with the young men at the \" Coombes.\" Great as was the opinion which he held of his import ance and abihties, he was unable to shut his eyes to the fact that those gentlemen seemed"], [182, "172 TWO PARDONS. to be armed at all points and to be men of no ordinary cahbre w7hom it were better pohcy to leave entirely alone."], [183, "CHAPTER VIII. QUITE AGAINST LAW AND ORDER. The morning commenced with a httle game of cross purposes. Two persons were much dis appointed, too. In a smaU town hke Avonham, consisting, as we have seen, of one long main street, a market-place, a churchyard, and two side streets, to meet a man whom you want is an easy matter, provided always that the man is in town. The general mode adopted is this. AVe wiU say, for example, that an Avonham Smith, wishes to meet, for business purposes, an Avonham Jones. Smith walks out in the morning, and caUs at Jones's house. Failing to find him at home, he visits the office ot AVhite, the shop of Black, and the hotel ot Robinson. To each of these citizens he con fides the fact that he wants to see Jones ; meeting two more acquaintances in the street he dehvers the same message \" in case you might see 'm.\" Then he trusts to chance and his friends. Each of the latter tells a friend that"], [184, "174 TWO PARDONS. Smith wants Jones, and in half-an-hour's time half the town knows the fact. Jones wiU hear that Smith wants him for hours after he has seen him, and, grown callous by long custom, wiU forty times reply to the question, \" Have 'ee seen Smith ? \" But these two persons, each of whom w-as seeking to find someone, did not employ this time-honoured and weU-nigh hifalhble plan to-day. They had, it is true, reasons of their own for not doing so, but the consequence was that each was disappointed. They were Alfred Shelman, whom, by this time, wo know, and Air. Jared Norton, cashier of the Avonham Bank, whom we have once seen. Alfred Shelman's object was to see Timothy Rapsey ; Jared Norton's object was to see Alfred Shelman, and each, that morning, failed. After a breakfast eaten rather more hastily than usual, Shelman entered the dog-cart w7hich was waiting for him by his overnight order, and, driving past the just-opened Bank, turned into the side street past the churchyard, puUed up at the door of the house in which Mr. Rapsey lived, and asked to see him. \" Mr."], [185, "QUITE AGAINST LAAV AND ORDER. 175 Rapsey ain't at home just now, sir,\" said the landlady, with many curtseys and bobbhigs. \" Dear me, that's very unfortunate,\" said Shelman ; \" wiU you teU Mr. Rapsey that I want to see him very particularly ? \" \" Oh, yes, certainly, sir,\" said the dame. \" Ask him, wiU you, whether he will step up to my house and have a bit of lunch with me at one o'clock. You won't forget, wiU you? \" Oh, dear me, no, Air. Shelman,\" said the landlady, highly gratified, for to lunch with Mr. Shelman was, in her eyes, to sit amongst the great ones, and she felt that the honour done to her lodger reflected on herself. Disappointment number one ! Shehnan turned and drove back to the Bank. He did not get clown, but one of the clerks, a junior, came out with a letter, which he handed to him. Shelman opened and read it. \" It is from Mr. AliUard,\" he said. \" I am just going out to Beytesbury to see him. There is nothing else, is there ? \" \" No, sh.\" \" Is Mr. Norton in ? \" He has been, sh, and opened the letters, after which he wont out immediately, saying"], [186, "176 TWO PARDONS. he should not be long. He gave us the letters. There is nothing special in them, sh.\" \" Tell him I called.\" \" Yes, sh.\" Shelman gave the reins to the horse and bowled aAvay, leaving behind him the man w7ho was seeking for him in great uneasiness of mind. The cause of Air. Norton's perturbation w7as this : he was accustomed to open aU letters received at the Bank, with the exception of those addressed specially to Mr. Boldham or Air. Shelman. The correspondence that morn ing had not been heavy ; the local farmers and tradesmen, Avith whom the bulk of the business lay, were fonder of transacting their affairs by personal interview than by letter, but one of the missives had greatly astonished him. Had the spire of St. Hildegard walked hito the Bank and requested him to discount its woathercock, he would have been scarcely more surprised than he was by the receipt of a letter from Timothy Rapsey, wilich stated that, in reply to their (the Bank's) communication, he would present himself at their establishment that day for the purpose of withdrawing both his deposit and current accounts, as requested. As re quested ! Air. Jared Norton called for the"], [187, "QUITE AGAINST LAW AND ORDER. 177 letter-book ; there was no copy of any such letter ! He himself had heard nothing of the matter, and it surpassed anything in his ex perience. Air. Rapsey, he reasoned, had banked with them for years and years, and was just the sort of customer with whom the country banker delights to do business, a man with an ever-growing deposit account, and one perfectly wiUing to accept the Bank rate of interest in heu of investing elsewhere. It was incompre hensible to him ; perhaps Air. Shelman might know something of it. He would not evon wait for him to visit the Bank but would go and see him at once. Now, had Mr. Norton informed one of his clerks where he w7as going, he would have been told that the gentleman of wiiom he w7as in quest had just driven past, but he kept his own counsel and turned into the mam street as Shelman turned into the side one where Rapsey hAod. When he reached Shehnan's house the door was opened by a maid-servant, ionorant that her master had left home, for he had driven out the back way. He seated him seff in the dining-room and waited fully ten minutes before the girl returned and informed him that she had discovered that Shelman had vol. ii. 29"], [188, "178 TAVO PARDONS. gone. Making his way back to the Bank, Air. Norton, to his great chagrin, w7as made ac quainted with the young man's visit, and retired to the Bank parlour lamenting his iU luck hi not catchhig him. Disappointment number two ! Mr. Norton resumed his accustomed seat, and waited the course of events. At eleven o'clock Timothy Rapsey en tered. The double burden of business winch he did not understand, and a secret winch he must not divulge, had changed the httle gossip's cheery bird-like face into a countenance of sphinx-like mystery and direful portent. Jared Norton, who had known him for thirty years, stared at him hi amazement. \" AVill you step this way, Air. Rapsey ? \" said he, not giving Timothy an opportunity of stating his business before the clerks. He led the way to the Bank parlour, where he gave the visitor a seat, and waited in great curiosity for his openmg address. \" I suppose you got my letter, Mr. Norton ? \" said Timothy. \" Yes, Mr. Rapsey, I did, and I was never more surprised hi \""], [189, "QUITE AGAINST LAAV AND ORDER. 179 \" Surprised, Air. Norton ! what, didn't you know of it, then ? \" \" Not one word, my dear sh, not one word, I assure you,\" answered the cashier. \" Well,\" said Timothy, taking a paper from his pocket, \" there's the letter that brought me here, Mr. Norton ; maybe you know7 who sent it.\" Norton gravely perused the letter, which we have already seen, and handed it back to its owner. \" It is correct enough, Mr. Rapsey,\" said he, \" although I knew nothing of it, and I'm very sorry to see it now.\" \" I've banked here a good many years, and never thought to be served this way,\" said Rapsey, ruefully ; \" but,\" he added, perking himseffup hke a bantam cock, \" I ain't under no obligation to the Bank so far as I can see, and 'tis your loss, not mine.\" \" But, dear heart ahve, Mr. Rapsey,\" said Norton, \" is it well to fall out with us hke this ? Why \" \" Now, Mr. Norton, I put it to you. Is it fair, after that letter, to say as I've fell out with you ? \" \" Well, well, perhaps not, Mr. Rapsey ; but 29\u20142"], [190, "180 TAVO PARDONS. won't you see Air. Shelmam himseU about it when he conies in ? \" \" Mr. Shelman was round to my place this morning, about an hour ago, and I was out.\" \" AVhy, that must have been whilst I was looking after him about this very matter, Air. Rapsey.\" \" 'Tis likely. Air. Shelman leaved a message to my house for me to come up and haA-e lunch with him at one o'clock, d'ye see, Mr. Norton ? \" \" AVhy, that's right,\" said Jared, much re lieved, \" that's right ; you can talk it \" \" Ah, but look 'ee here see, Air. Norton,\" said Timothy, emphasising his words with his forefinger on the palm of his other hand, \" I won't go, y' know ! \" Jared stared. \" Air. Shelman,\" said Timothy, with the same finger and palm play, \" have a -threatened me with an action \" Jared started and stared yet more. \" And Air. Shelman have written to me,\" pursued Timothy, \" for me to draw all my money away. Now, Mr. Norton, I b'ain't going to be put upon by Mr. Shelman, n'yet no one else, and so, as it sims likely as I shall w-ant"], [191, "QUITE AGAINST LAAV AND ORDER. 181 my money to pay law expenses, I'm come for it now, according to this letter.\" Mr. Norton shook his head regretfully, but saw no solution of the difficulty. \" Will you take the money now, Air. Rap sey ? \" said he. \" If you please, Air. Norton. You've got my pass-book, and I've brought my deposit note and cheque-book, and if you'll let me know what I'm to draw for, I'll do't at once and take all away together.\" Jared Norton gave up the business of per suasion in despair. The wiiole thing was, so far as he was concerned, wrapped in mystery, and quite outside his banking experience. He sent for the book, and carried out the calcula tions necessary for a final closing of the ac counts. Having done this with the ah of a martyr, he informed Timothy of the amount standing to his credit in their books under both heads. Timothy produced his cheque-book with an air of great dignity and proceeded to fill in the partly-written cheque which he had prepared for the occasion. It was a tolerably large sum, and, annoyed as he was, the httle man could not resist a feeling of satisfaction as he wrote"], [192, "182 TAVO PARDONS. the three figures after the \u00a3. Not many men in Avonham, he thought, as he gazed com placently at them, would write such a cheque for one sum at once. But the amount on deposit, all of winch Air. Rapsey asked for in notes, was something to look complacent over. Shelman had not spoken lightly when he told his confederate to what state of comfort Air. Rapsey's frugality had brought him. He left the room and went to the front office of the Bank itself to receive the notes. As Norton finished counting the amount of the current account, Air. Beadlemore Arto entered with a cheque. He shook hands with Timothy, gave \" good day \" to the cashier and clerks, and stood waiting his turn. Air. Arto was not curious \u2014 oh, dear, no ! \u2014 but he was not unwilling to notice, and Mr. Rapsey was not unwilling that he should notice, the amount which he received. Air. Arto opened his eyes but said nothing. Jared Norton then, with a face full of un utterable things, handed solemnly to Rapsey a second sheaf of notes, and held out his hand for Air. Beadlemore Arto's cheque. That worthy's eyes were dilated to their fullest extent as he noted the sum that his crony was"], [193, "QUITE AGAINST LAW AND ORDER. 183 telling over. AVhen he had counted them twice, Timothy put the notes carefully into a large envelope which he had brought with him, and, placing this in his breast pocket, carefuUy buttoned both his inner and outer coats, and bade Air. Norton and the clerks good-day. Air. Arto received the money for the cheque which he presented and followod him out. \" Where be goin' to ? \" was his salutation. \" Up to Chris Raraty's,\" rephed Timothy. \" I want to see 'm.\" \" He's over to Pinniffer's,\" said Arto. \" I see him goin' in as I went into th' Bank just now.\" \" Ah, I do want him to let me have a trap to drive OAor to Ridgetown on a bit o' business,\" said Timothy. \" Be 'ee goin' to buy the place, Timothy Rapsey, that ye're taking all that cash over there with 'ee ? T'ood be worth anyone's while to foller and stop ye on the road,\" said Mr. Beadlemore Arto, laughing at his own wit. \" No, I'm not,\" said Timothy, his face lowering in spite of the comfortable feehng of the notes in his pocket. \" I've been and drawed all my money out o' Boldham's Bank,"], [194, "184 TWO PARDONS. and I'm goin' over to Ridgetown to put it in the North Aiarlshire.\" \" Drawed all yer money out o' Boldham's ! \" said Beadlemore Arto, stopping in his surprise and staring hard at Timothy, as though he were demented ; \" why, what hi the name o' sense and patience did 'ee do that for ? \" \" I wore told to,\" said Timothy. \" Why, who upon earth told 'ee ? \" asked Beadlemore, still staring, if anything, wider than ever. \" I mustn't tell 'ee,\" said Timothy, the sense of his secret agahi woigbing on him. \" Now, don't ask me ; I really can't tell 'ee ; 'tis a secret, and don't for pity's sake say any thing about it ! \" Mr. Beadlemore Arto resumed his progress, and the pair entered the familiar room together and found their cronies assembling pretty much as usual. Mr. Raraty was, as had been said, amongst the company, and Air. Rapsey was not an hour older before, seated hi a dog cart behind a good-looking but steady-going mare, belonging to that gentleman, he wras well on the way to Ridgetown. He left behind him hi Avonham a very thoughtful and puzzled man in Mr. Arto."], [195, "QUITE AGAINST LAW AND ORDER. 185 That worthy pondered deeply over the words which Timothy had let fall. Whence he got his information (for he had no idea of the real state of the case, nor dreamed that the Bank authorities, or one of them, at least, had told him to withdraw his account) he could not imagine ; it was sufficient for him that it had been done under his eyes, and that there was a screw loose somewhere. Was it with the Bank ? Mr. Arto's transactions in corn, hay, oats, and straw were many, and his stand ing balance was not large hi proportion to his trade ; nevertheless, it was large enough to make him feel uneasy about it in the face of what he had seen. He went home, took out his cheque-book and drew a cheque winch reduced his balance to a very small sum indeed. He took it into the Bank with an excuse ready : a contemplated cash purchase on a large scale ; he had sometimes had to do so before. Norton heard his explanation, made no comment, but paid him the money cheerfully enough. In half-an-hour, Mr. Foil well came in and drew five hundred pounds : this was unusual. Following closely on his heels came AVolstenhohne Pye, who was going to Bristol market on the next day, it appeared,"], [196, "186 TAVO PARDONS. and who also presented a heavy cheque. These were succeeded by ex-Alayor Killett, Air. Polhmoy and Air. Barnabas Chickleholt, who all appeared constrained hi their manner, and were armed with cheques for somewhat abnormal amounts, made payable to \" SeU.\" By one o'clock, Air. Norton was getting a httle fidgety. There was nothing hke a run on the Bank, and, knowing the resources he had at hand, he felt that even had that happened no real harm could come to such a steady and solvent establishment. But his experience told him that, setting Timothy's matter aside, this was the heaviest morning's draw he had ever had on a non-market day, and he shrewdly guessed that news of the transaction of the morning Avas circulating among the particular circle to which Air. Rapsey was especially affiliated, that a mistaken idea of its nature had arisen, and that a wind of suspicion was beginning to blow on the credit of the Bank. He despatched an urgent note to Alfred Shelman, begging him to come to the Bank at once on most important and pressing business. Shehnan's errand that morning had been to Beytesbury to complete with Air. Aiillard the"], [197, "QUITE AGAINST LAAV AND ORDER. 187 arrangements for the purchase of the land belonging to the latter, w7hich Shelman wanted for his new house. All the points in question having been amicably discussed, and actual signature and transfer of deeds and payment of money being alone necessary to finish the business, Mr. Millard had returned to Avonham with Shelman, and had proceeded to the office of his friend Sennett to give him final instruc tions. Alfred had meanwhile gone to his house in the expectation of being shortly and punctu ally waited upon by Timothy Rapsey, whom a httle condescension and a little champagne would reduce to a peaceable and forgiving con dition. To his surprise, however, Timothy had not been seen, and, in the midst of his wonder at his absence, Norton's message came ; he immediately proceeded to the Bank, expecting nothing more important or pressing than that his signature was required for some special piece of business. Old Norton met him, wearing an anxious appearance, which he noticed as he passed through the front office. \" What's the matter, Norton ? \" he said, as he seated himself in a chair in the parlour, whither the cashier followed him."], [198, "188 TAVO PARDONS. \" I am glad you have come, Air. AUred,\" said Norton ; \"I was getting rather anxious without you. I have had a very heaA7y morn- ing.\" Alfred Shelman did not answer, but awaited the business for which it had been deemed necessary to summon him. The old cashier waited a moment for him to speak ; but, receiving no reply, went on : \" Air. Rapsey has been here this morning, >) sir. \" Ah ! \" said Shelman, suddenly e\\incing an interest in what was going forward. \" I tried to see you at ten o'clock,\" said Norton, \" but we unfortunately missed each other. I got a letter from Mr. Rapsey, in answer to one from this office, informing us that he would call and remove his accounts, as requested in our communication. Air. Alfred, there is no trace of that letter in the copying book, and, of course, I know7 nothing of it.\" \" No, no, I know,\" said Shelman, hastily. \" I wrote it myself and did not copy it\u2014 well, what did Rapsey say ? I invited him to lunch to-day, to talk the matter over ; I suppose he didn't get the message in time.\" o o \" He got the message, Air.

He would have a pretty quarter of an hour with his uncle when he came to hear of it. \" Of course I had no alternative in the face of your letter but to give him what he demanded,\" said Norton, \" and I paid him. I fear that is not the worst of it.\" \" What else is there ? \" said Shelman. \" Why, Air. Alfred,\" said Norton, lowering his voice and approaching nearer to Shelman, \" I fear that some mischief may follow. Mr. Arto was here when I was paying Mr. Rapsey, and they went out together.

Rapsey and all in one chque, and it's hard to say what rumours may get about in this place. It's not a good town to keep a secret in and wo may have a run upon us at a moment's notice.\" The old fellow looked grave ; Shelman alarmed. \" But we've nothing to fear from that,\" said the latter, after a moment's thought. \" AVe could pay every current account fho times over.\" \" If I didn't know that,\" said the elder man, smiling, \" I should be worse upset than I am. But a run never did a bank any good yet, sir, and never will. People may say that the fact of standing against a run is a good advortisement, but I doubt it.

Shelman, however, was too keen not to see that he was talking sound common sense, and he received the counsel readily. \" You're right, Norton ; the fact is I\\o been over hasty with Rapsey about an election matter, and I thought to give him a bit of a scare \u2014 that's all, upon my word \u2014 and he has taken the matter more seriously than I thought he would.\" And he explained to Norton the chcumstances of the case. \" Law's a funny thing to play with,\" said the cashier, when he had heard the tale ; \" take my advice, Mr. Alfred, make the matter right with Rapsey, and get his accounts back"], [202, "192 TWO PARDONS. here again.

You needn't fear,\" he added, laughing ; \" I won't treat him roughly. I'll smooth him clown the right way.\" \"I hope you may, sir,\" said Norton ; and he returned to his duties whilst Shelman took his hat and quitted the Bank in search of Timothy Rapsey. Air. Rapsey was not at home, for the second time that day ; his landlady was quite con cerned that Air. Shelman had missed him again ; perhaps, she added, Mr. Shelman, if he didn't mind going there, might find him at the \" Bear.\" To the \" Bear\" then, he directed his steps. That famous hostel filled, as will doubtless haA-e been obsenod, more functions than that of providing good cheer for the wayfarer ; it was the Exchange of Avonham, the local Parliament House or talking-shop ofthe place, and half the business of the town was trans acted under the vaulted roof of its ancient gateway or in its spacious panelled rooms.

So that even so mighty an AA-onham potentate as Mr. Alfred Shelman lost none of his dignity in repairing to the great meeting-place of the town in search of another citizen. But, important as w7as his business, he little guessed wiiat would be the termination of his visit there that day. The first person whom he saw w7as Miss Pmniffer, seated at the window of the bar, brave in hlac poplin and cherry-coloured ribbons. In answer to his queries, Miss Pimhffer informed him that Mr. Rapsey was not there \u2014 had gone out driving somewhere. Air. Raraty w7as in the parlour and could tell him where, no doubt.

Rami's creed on the point under discussion wras will, perhaps, never be known; for events crowded so thickly on the enuncia tion of its first two words that it was never finished. Shelman entered the room, and Air. Rami's mouth closed with a nervous snap. Shelman took no notice of any of the words which he had heard, although he had some difficulty in restraining himself ; he looked smilingly round the room and gave as near an approach to a cheery \" Good morning, gentle men,\" as was possible from one of his unamiable temperament. \" Good morning, sir,\" rephed the room, not without a sense of guilt upon those wiio had just been discussing the very man whom they wore saluting."], [205, "QUITE AGAINST LAW AND ORDER. 195 \" Can I have a word with you, Raraty ? \" said Shelman. \" Certainly, sir,\" said the post-master, rising from his seat with alacrity and advancing to the door. \" Do you know where Mr. Rapsey has gone to?\" \" He's taken one of my dog-carts, and gone to Ridgetown,\" said Christopher Raraty. \" Ah,\" said Shelman, \" I w7anted to see him before he went, but presently will do as well ; would you be good enough, if you should see him when he returns, to tell him I should hke to have a word with him up at my house ? \" Mr. Raraty promised to convey the message. It was Shelman' s object to remain a few minutes in the room, quite at his ease, partly with a view of reassuring the minds of the assembled friends, all of whom he saw were customers of the Bank, by his appearance of unconcern, and partly to offer any one of them an opportunity of speaking to him on the sub ject which he knew was uppermost in each man's mind, in order that he might be able, without appearing to volunteer any informa tion, to set at rest any doubts which might have arisen respecting the stability of his firm. 30\u20142"], [206, "196 TWO PARDONS.

But now the little man whom he had barely tolerated, except at the Bank, and w7hom he had looked upon merely as an animated puppet w7ho occasionally made him smile, was all in all to him, and his absence meant he knew not what evils and dangers, while the rest of the men sat silent and glum, with a silence and a glumness that were almost threatening.

Barnabas Chickleholt could have feigned, and with an ill-temper very foreign to the nature of that grim personage, who hke another and more celebrated man had nothing of the bear about him except the skin. The conversation did not at once re-com mence. Shelman had left the room but not the hotel, as they could hear his voice in the passage in conversation. John Rann w7as the first to break the silence. \" Well, that don't seem very much hke anything being wrong with the Bank, Mr. Chickleholt,\" said he, in a low tone. Rann, who had been one of the strongest partisans of Air.

Wolstenholme Pye, who was sitting close to the window, got up and looked out with a loud, \" Lawks a daisy how ! \" and flung the sash up, thrusting out his head, and as much of his body as he could with safety get through. Rann dropped his pipe, which shivered to pieces on the floor, and Barnabas Chickleholt, who was nearest the door, threw it open and rushed out into the passage fol lowed by all in the room, except the Pyes, w7ho fraternally shared the window.

The fun went out of Bryceson's face the moment he saw Shelman ; he had not expected to meet him just then, but his mind was made up with respect to him, and he determined to brhig him to book at once.

So that the gateway of the \" Bear,\" ahvays the busiest spot in the town on market clay, was more thronged than ever, and from early morning till late in the afternoon the battle was fought again.

During this period of excitement and uni versal thirst for neAvs and gossip, there was one person in Avonham who was supremely uncomfortable. It was fortunate that the principal portion of Adolphus Carter's work was mere routine, or assuredly the hiterests of his employer would have suffered from the abstraction and preoccupation of his articled pupil, Avho, ordinarily, could be trusted with important affairs, and who had not in the least exaggerated his abilities when he had declared that he was not a fool in his business . The worst result of his folly that he had pictured to himself was that Shelman would have been compelled to eat a httle humble -pie with Timothy Rapsey, and he had not counted, as indeed his friend had not, on the vigorous and forcible action of Walter Bryceson being the first outcome of his confession of his misdeeds and the share that Shelman had had in them.

He found no comfort from his meditations ; the more he thought the matter over the blacker looked the prospect to him. To add to his woes, too, every one of the callers at Air. Bompas's office seemed to imagine that he took the liveliest interest in the affray, and plied him with awkward questions and distasteful chatter. Perhaps the one slender piece of consolation which came to him was the thought that Shelman had met the punishment with which he had threatened him in his irritation. But it was scanty consolation, after all, and there w-as no man in AAonham that day with thoughts more bitter, and prospects more gloomy, than Adolphus Carter. It took him a long time to make up his mind to visit the defeated man, and it was more through fear of incurring his anger than from sympathy with him that he at last determined to do so. He quitted the office ostensibly for dinner, and made his way down the bustling and busy street, ghing the briefest returns to the v7arious greetings he"], [224, "214 TWO PARDONS. received.

For a minute or two he passed his hand over his forehead, wiiilst Adolphus stood watching him AA-ith a face full of alarm, and, to do him jus - tice, of sympathy. \" You are ill,\" he said at last \u2014 \" let me get you some brandy or something ; can you tell me where it is ? \" Shelman's physical pain conquered his rage for a time ; he pointed to a cupboard, from which Carter took some brandy and gave him some, mixed with w7ater. \" I won't agitate you by any more talk,\" said he, wiien he had rendered him this ser vice ; \"I really did not come here to quarrel or to blame you ; my only object was to see how you wore.\" \" Well,\" said Shelman faintly, but with no abatement of his malice, \"now you have seen"], [229, "THE MURMUR OF THE HIVE. 219 \u2014 and feasted your eyes on my condition \u2014 you can go.\" \" I am going,\" said Carter, taking his hat from the table, \" but before I do go I will say one thing \" \" Say it quickly and go then,\" said Shel- man. \" You are very foolish to quarrel with me,\" said Carter impressively, turning as he spoke, \" for I verily belieAO that I am the only friend you have in Avonham at the present minute.\" His hand wras on the handle of the door, and he was going, when Shelman cried out hoarsely, \" Stop ! come here, come back ; sit down and wait a minute w7hile I recover a httle.\" Adolphus turned back and sat down ; Shelman struggled with himself, and drank a little more of the brandy and water. \"Tell me,\" he said, \" what they are saying about this affair in the town. I suppose the whole place is full of it ? \" Mr. Carter owned that it had been the chief topic of conversation that day. \" Curse the cackling fools ! what are they saying about it ? \" \" They put it down to the election and the attack on the ' Coombes,' \" answered Carter ;"], [230, "220 TAVO PARDONS. \" of course, you know, Timothy Rapsey has been talking.\" \" Has he said anything against the Bank ? \" said Shelman eagerly, \" has he done that ? \" \" I don't know that he has,\" said Carter, \" I haven't been near the httle brute all day \u2014 I only know w-hat has passed from conver sations I have had with people in the office.\" \" Fhid out, will you ? \" said Shelman ; \" get to know all that he has said, speak to him yourself ; don't frighten him, but get out of him all you can and let me know to-morrow. Hush ! here is someone coming upstairs. Don't say a word of this before him, Avhoever he may be ! \" The servant knocked at the door, and re ceiving permission to enter, announced Doctor Aiompesson, who followed immediately on his heels. The doctor gaAO a glance of displeasure at the visitor, and shook his finger reproachingly at the patient. \" This won't do, Shelman, you know7 ; I must forbid you to see any visitors for a day or two.\" \" I was so confoundedly hipped here all alone, doctor,\" said Shelman, taking the"], [231, "THE MURMUR OF THE HIVE. 221 excuse out of Carter's mouth, \" that when Carter called I ordered him to be shown up.\" \" I haven't been here ten minutes, Doctor,\" said Carter, and extending his hand to his unfortunate friend, who, this time, did not refuse it, he backed out of the room. Outside the house he waited for the doctor, w7ho made his appearance in about a quarter of an hour. He was not driving, so Carter joined him, and they w-alked townwards together. \" AVhat do you think of him ? \" he asked. \" What do you ? \" said the doctor drily. \" I think he looks very bad,\" said Carter. \" He is very bad,\" said Doctor Mompesson, \" and your visit hasn't done him any good ; I have given strict injunctions that no one is to be admitted to see him yet, not eAon his uncle.\" \" I didn't think I was doing any harm by calling,\" said Carter, penitently ; \" of course I w7as naturally anxious to know how he w-as getting on.\" \" Naturally,\" answered the doctor, \" but he must be kept in perfect quietness.\" \" I suppose,\" said Adolphus, hesitatingly, \" he has been \u2014 been soundly \u2014 I mean very severely injured ! \""], [232, "222 TAVO PARDONS. \" He has been handled about as roughly as ever a man was,\" answered Doctor Alompesson gravely. \" Before you were born, Air.

If you haA-e any difference with Air. Bryceson, don't attempt to settle it that way, young fellow, I adA-ise you.\" Adolphus, recoUecting how narrowiy he had escaped the same treatment, experienced the sensation quaintly described as that of \" a person walking over his graA-e.\" \" Is he in any clanger ? \" he asked after Avalking on silently for hah a minute. \" No immediate danger,\" said the doctor, \" so long as he is kept perfectly quiet, as I told you, and that is w7hy I have put the veto on any callers. Encephalitis is what I'm most afraid of,\" he added, half to himself and half to Carter, \" but aao can avoid that Avith care, I think.\" Adolphus had not the shghtest idea of what encephalitis might be, and w-as somewhat alarmed at the idea that his confederate w7as"], [233, "THE MURMUR OF THE HIVE. 223 in danger of an ailment with so formidable a name. \" I hope he will soon recoA-er,\" he said, and reaUy meant it too. \" I hope so,\" answored the doctor, \"for his own sake and for other people's as well.\" And with these parting words, which bore no grain of consolation to Adolphus, the doc tor bade him good-day and crossed the road to caU on an old friend who would be treated by no one else, although, as we haAO before said, Doctor Alompesson had practically retired from his profession. Adolphus turned moodily into South Street, but brightened up as he saw Timothy Rapsey on the other side of the way. For a moment he forgot Shelman's ad\\ice not to frighten him, and determined that he should share the unpleasant feehngs under wilich he him seff was suffering. He crossed the road and accosted the httle man. \" This is a bad business about Shelman,\" he commenced, carefully watching Timothy's face. \" Ah ! \" said Timothy, looking wise, \" per haps it will teach Mr. Shelman a lesson, Mr. Carter.\""], [234, "224 TWO PARDONS. \" I'm afraid it will teach some one else a lesson,\" answered Carter, lugubriously. \" I wouldn't be hi your shoes if he were to die, Rapsey ; you set Mr. Bryceson on to him, you know. It's your fault from beginning to end, and I only hope you won't have precious good cause to remember it.\" \" But,\" stammered Timothy, not attempt ing to protest his guiltlessness hi the matter, but dreadfully alarmed by this speech, \"Air. Shelman isn't in any danger, is he ? \" \" Isn't he ? \" said Carter, nodding his head hi the emphatic manner which generaUy ac companies this question when put sarcas tically. \" No, but is he ? \" said Timothy, much alarmed, he scarcely knew at wiiat ; \" you talked about his dying, Air.

The only outward signs of their London A'isit were some sweet novelties hi Regent Street dresses and Bond Street bonnets, which so far as the female portions of his congregation was con cerned, completely nullified any of the preach ing of the good old vicar, on the first Sunday after their arrival, and caused many Avonham young ladies to give way to outbursts of semi hysterical satire, and many matrons to thank Heaven that their daughters were not as other men's were. The young ladies themselves wore soon the recipients of feminine congratu lations couched in various shades of envy, hatred, and malice, but to them, who could, as we haA-e observed, take their own part in this phase of feminine warfare remarkably well, these gave but little concern.

They were also disappointed at getting no opinion from him upon the subject, beyond the broad state ment that it was a pity for young men to quarrel, that a personal encounter was at all times a matter for regret and a thing to be deplored by the friends of both parties, that the whole affair appeared to be the result of injudicious chatter, and that he, for one, dechned to commit himseff to any other ex pression of opinion about it. 32\u20142"], [238, "TWO PARDONS. 228 Mr. Bompas oracularly delivered this opinion at the first meeting of the Club which he attended after his return from London, and his ideas being wrarmly supported by Mr. Sennett, and by peace-loving Reuben Matley, who possessed that influence which a uniformly quiet man of parts always has in a country town, the matter, after a good deal of cogitation on the part of those wrho had made it the leading topic for a week, became unpopular and began to lose interest in Avonham. During the period of Air. Bompas's stay in London, the town had been deprived of the presence of three more of its shining hghts. Airs. Stanhope had been absent and Sh Headingly Cann had been seeking relaxation from his labours. Air.

There was no intention of concealing the ceremony when it did take place ; on the contrary, it was determined that all AAonham should be gay that day, and that the affair should be as brilliant as possible. Sir Headingly Cann had returned for the purpose of overhauling and tautening such portions of the political rigging of the good ship Britannia as were entrusted to his care. He had to meet his constituents, to congratulate them on the fact that the country, which had been in such deadly peril whilst the opposite party had been the Ins, was now saved by the fact that the opposite party were now the Outs.

Walter Rivers accompanied Sir Headingly, and was on the most excellent terms with himseU and the whole world.

So it foUowed that the course of this particular true love commenced smoothly and fairly enough, how ever it nhght be destined to end.

She was not displeased, she was accustomed to being admired ; there was nothing bold in the glance either, and the man was evidently a gentleman. There was very little difficulty about the selection ofthe pocket-book ; Aiarkham handled two or three, chose one, paid for it, left the shop, and mounted his horse. \" Who is that ? \" asked the Queen of Avon ham, as he rode away. \" I don't know the gentleman's name, madam,\" said Mr. Polhmoy, \" but he is staying with Mr. Bryceson, the gentleman on the other horse, at Mr. Galbraith's house, the one that he purchased of you, madam.\" \" Indeed,\" said Mrs. Stanhope, carelessly. \" Yes, madam,\" said Polhmoy, \" he has not"], [244, "234 TWO PARDONS. been here long, indeed he only arrived on the day \" \u2014 here he gave a little cough \u2014 \" previous to the \u2014 the unfortunate encounter between Air.

When Markham had emerged from the shop, and had mounted, the friends rode on together until they were clear of the town, and out of hearing of anyone.
