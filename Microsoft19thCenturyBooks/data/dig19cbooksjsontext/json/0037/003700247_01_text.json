TDRESBYTERIAN Scotland has one saint in the calendar for whom she still cherishes some reverent love. Unlike most saints, this one has few ignorant, un lettered votaries, unless it may be in her peculiar locality, and among a sprinkling of young Catholic girls, who lay flowers on her altar and neglect the study of her life, in one of the convents or conventual schools in the kingdom. To the scholar she only exists in the record of her con fessor, Turgot. But to the lover of popular stories and folk-lore, Saint Margaret (Queen Margaret) is a great pre sence. With her sweet eyes, her auburn hair, her learning, her sorrows, her fasts and vigils, and her wifely love, she lives in tradition among the stern covenanting people of Scotland. How she came a wanderer to the court of the Cean Mohr, how she lived a saint in the midst of its barbaric splendour, and how she proved herself a brave, patient, fond wife, under the faint, sickly odour of her sanctity, may be worth telling, even in these bustling times. b"], [14, "Days 0/ Yore. 2 !. \u2014 the wanderer. It is far, far back, in the days of vikings, bards, mailed knights, and veiled ladies. The first Crusade has not yet started for the East, and the black Danes hover in crowds on every coast in Western Europe. Norman William has just landed in Saxon England, and his beaked boats are scuttled in the Channel ; Sanguelac has just been fought and Harold slain, and the banner of the White Horse pulled down. Saxon thane and yeoman are fain to flee to friendly Scotland, while Matilda of Flanders and her women sit weaving the famous Bayeux tapestry. Every fresh thread is but another leaf in the garland of fierce William, whose violence Matilda knows to her cost. But he is hers now, and, like other discreet souls, she bends her proud spirit to the yoke, and even gets to be proud of William's iron hardness, just as the fool Lady Hameline vaunts of her wild boar of Ardennes. On the broad Frith of Forth (called then Scotwater), whose whales' tongues were carefully preserved as dainty bits for Scotland's kings, there rode, under stress of weather, a boat which might well have drawn attention. Its gilded sides rose like walls, its head and stern were like the gables of a house, while its clumsy sails con tended with its banks of oars. It was overcrowded with angry, mournful, weary men and women. It had run into the bay, named afterwards St. Margaret's Hope, and had cast anchor off the Binks, or low-lying rocks, which as a background to a boat with a queen, and three sea-"], [15, "Saint Margaret. 3 mews hovering overhead, were in days long after to flourish in the burghal seal of Dunfermline. The widow of the son of Edmund Ironside, her son Edgar Atheling, the Saxon heir of England, and his sisters Margaret and Catherine, with their train, were thus arrested on their way to the forests and vineyards of Hungary, the widow's native home. Most of the company were unlike the great Apostle in all save one thing. They had been in perils by land and by sea ; in danger oft, and in troubles many. They had escaped from the victorious Normans on the great field where William was to build his abbey, to atone for the slaughter of a multitude of faithful men. They had been flying hither and thither, skulking in the marshes about Ely, or lying in the wilds of Northumberland. At last they had embarked on this treacherous sea, which, in place of bearing them across to Germany, had cast them, like dishonoured waifs, on the coast of this poor rough little Scotland. But the waves might have been more unkind. Scotland was at least friendly under Malcolm, who had been himself a fugitive, and educated under the protection of Edward the Confessor, ere he returned to avenge the murder of Duncan, his father, and to reign in his father's seat. Those poor Saxon aldermen and franklins \u2014 with their long cloaks, long beards, and heavy dulness of aspect, at which the Normans laughed so unmercifully, as if beaten men could be buoyant or witty, unless, indeed, they were Frenchmen \u2014 had not much counsel to give their superiors, the weary Agathe, the weak Edgar, the B 2"], [16, "Days of Yore. 4 sick Catherine, the dauntless Margaret. But, after some consultation, it was determined to send an embassy to Malcolm, who was reported to be at Dunfermline, to entreat his hospitality and aid. They would ask him to nourish them during the storm, and to speed them on their voyage when the blast had blown by. The Lady Margaret offered to be the bearer of the credentials and the message. Margaret perhaps had reasons of her own for urging that she might be permitted to go and treat with the potentate. It must be understood also that the Queen's Ferry, named by her descendants after royal Margaret, is no great distance from the tower by the winding stream. Margaret might go and come without any difficulty, under the escort of Ambrose, Adhelm, or Dunstan, reverent fathers who accompanied and blessed the expedition. Moreover, necessity laughs at formalities. Margaret bore down opposition, and set out on her adventure. After long walking by the woods of Pitreavie, she at length approached Dunfermline. On she speeds in her fine linen tunic and furred mantle with couvrechief and veil, her bronze hair flowing full length and reaching down to her girdle, but confined in two broad full plaits, and thrown forward over her shoulders. Footsore and trembling at the heart, like any mean woman, she seats herself on the stone which for eight hundred years has borne her name. To her last day she loved to seek out this stone, and on her aftei progresses to Edinburgh, she often held there her mid day meal. Royal Margaret, with her tawny hair and her"], [17, "Saint Margaret. 5 eyes clear, cold, in their deep dark grey, and her wonderful energy, wisdom, and purity, was, indeed, a marvel of womankind. Her companions rest at a respectful distance. Even Father Ambrose whom she favours in her love of all those who preach and teach righteousness, scarcely advances a step nearer than the others. Mar garet sits in queenly solitude. Could such as Margaret, indeed, be other than solitary? What does Margaret dream of as she gazes on the woodlands around her ? The greater portion of the land is hunting-ground, as it is in that Hungary to which she is bound : the oak and beech are red from the touch of autumn's sharp fingers, and the leaves are swiftly swirled in eddies about her feet. Does she look back longingly to England and the sway of the royal Monk, whose bequest had drenched his country with blood, and was now driving her into exile ? Or does she glance forward at the towering Carpathians and that swift Danube by which another canonized queen bears her crown of thorns ? Does she even dimly foresee that she will yet triumph and rule, not only in life, but in death ? Does she read of a destiny, difficult in its high happiness and prosperity; of her wedding a noble husband, of her cradling six stout sons, or of the omens pointing also to cold flinty rocks \u2014 the bread and the water, the scourge for the rich and the great, and the oil and the wine for the poor? Does she anticipate with that strange prescience given to pure minds that her spirit will pass away amidst bloody strife, contention, and terrible wrong, such as overshadowed her birth, or that from the dust"], [18, "Days of Yore. 6 before the altar in the wattled church of Dunfermline, which in later days shall rise into a solemn abbey, more than one royal race will claim to have its source ? Or does Margaret with her sandalled foot fashion the fallen leaves into some fantastic pattern, and recall the last occasion on which she met the Cean Mohr \u2014 when the northern chief did homage to her beauty and her grandeur of soul, and when she slighted the half-tamed barbarian ? Or has she misgivings that now the day of reckoning has come, and that her helpless kindred will suffer for her error ? Or does Margaret \u2014 wise woman \u2014 cast aside all such distracting reflections and refresh herself with the changing hues of the forest verdure, the great sweeps of the sky \u2014 now heavenly in its peaceful blue, now cumbered with labouring clouds ? Whatever her meditations, Margaret does not long delay her errand. Margaret never yet delayed when effort was to be made or penalty endured. \" Father Ambrose, we must hasten and hie us home ere set of sun \u2014 home !\" Margaret took back the word and dwelt on it with a touch of irony. \"Yet we can make a home even on ship-board, as the curlew skims on the foaming water ; only my mother and Catherine and poor Edgar refuse to mate with the curlew so long as the meanest hut stands on solid ground.\" Far on in the day they reach the fair flat summit of the hill in the glen of Pittencrieff, on which Malcolm has built his grey tower. Happily for them there is Malcolm, just returned from the chase, alighting among a throng of courtiers."], [19, "Saint Margaret. 7 Malcolm is no longer the young lad dazed and de mented by his father's murder. Thirteen good years have elapsed since he returned to meet the usurper, when the ghost-ridden man was goaded into the last flash of manhood and valour. A contrast, indeed, is there between the boy Malcolm who flees from Macbeth and leans upon Macduff, and this big mature Cean Mohr, who would flee from no earthly evil, and who leans upon nought but his own good sword and his God. Malcolm has won the ripe renown of his hot fiery temper, and his large, placable, bountiful, heart. Matthew of Westminster relates an anecdote about Malcolm and the foundation of his favourite tower in the glen of Pittencrieff, when no palace as yet stood there, and the abbey itself was but a wooden shed. The king had learned by sure information that one of his principal nobles was plotting his death. He arranged a hunting feast, summoned the offender, and planned that they two should be left alone on this little clear mound. There he charged the noble with his treason, and drawing his sword, called upon him to come on \" body to body,\" and fight him like a man, where there was none to interfere between them; whereupon the villain flung himself down and shed bitter but wholesome tears at the king's feet, avowed his repentance, and swore to prove henceforth his most loyal devoted servant. And the good king assured him of his hearty forgiveness, and related to no man what had been said and done betwixt them. Each kept his frank word, and no wonder Malcolm conceived a fondness for the spot with its many attractions \u2014 the"], [20, "8 Days of Yore. circling stream and the tall trees in the gully below, under which the deer were wont to couch ; and so he built there his hunting tower. Malcolm had just been apprised of the arrival of the \"Dragon\" and its crew in the bay at Inverkeithing. Little more than a year ago, when he was south about Newcastle, whither he had come with sword and shield, and bill and bow, to defend the cause of the tottering House of Cerdic, he encountered Lady Margaret, and entered the lists as an urgent suitor for her hand. Malcolm was a rough, unlettered soldier. His youthful years had been spent in Edward's court, where the Romance language of the Norman courtiers, and the penitential psalms of the monkish king, bearing down the homely, hardy Saxon nature, ill served to obliterate his ghastly recollections of the early tragedy which drove him there, or to excite in him a taste for peaceful study. But though Malcolm could scarcely spell out a line in Saxon, British or Latin, and though he scrawled his name vilely, he was a master in sport and in warfare. He drew a fine bow; he threw a falcon and brought to the quarry; he well stood the shock of a muscular antagonist, and he smote a desperate enemy hip and thigh. And then he had such an eye for greenery and venery, he could speedily run over the landscape and mark out tower and hamlet, mill and lochlet \u2014 an eye that could thoroughly scan man or beast, and pronounce skilfully upon either. A bold, generous, true man, ready and capable in his instinctive truthfulness ; no wonder he was well beloved in his kingdom. Rare sovereigns have ruled in little"], [21, "Saint Margaret. 9 Scotland \u2014 Robert the Deliverer, James the Poet, Mary the Queen of Beauty and of Tragedy; but none was ever obeyed with readier will and duty than Malcolm \u2014 the Cean Mohr, the Great Head, yet whose heart it Mas that obtained for him the surname bestowed on his sagacity. Malcolm was no inflammable, hasty, blundering monarch, likely to elevate to his crown and throne a fair face, a shallow brain, or a cozening tongue. Half proud, half humble, he was conscious enough of his mental defects, and in his greatness he valued cultivation the more in others ; and, above all, he loved to find in women the intelligence and refinement which he wanted. He had waited these thirteen years without a queen and partner, not because he was fault-finding and arrogant, but because he had an honest sense of his dignity as a man and king, and would not wed unworthily. He had chanced upon Lady Margaret, had instantly chosen her, and had sought her with all the sincerity and force of his character; but Margaret would then have none of him. With all the fineness of her faculties, and their keenness through training, she yet had failed to see the beauty and force of Malcolm's character in his clumsy bluntness. She only noticed his uncouthness and barrenness of all book knowledge ; besides, Margaret had no great mind to marry. In the train of the Confessor there was an almost universal vocation to the cloister ; and Margaret had early yearnings, deep communings, sublime visions. Her better angel caused her to hesitate, however. Mother, and sister, and brother needed to be upheld"], [22, "Days of Yore. 10 by her advice and consolation. Then, too, she loved freedom, and bright, beautiful nature, second only to study. So Margaret and the Cean Mohr had parted, scarcely expecting to meet again. Stout, gallant, and with a well balanced mind, he could stand that sharp disappoint ment with the other crosses of his lot. None ever saw him blench. Perhaps even in the healthful hardy nature, the rankling regret was beginning to die out, though the memory was still cherished. But Malcolm could wait, and he could work for his end too. He was no vain boy to be swallowed up with pique and spite. He forgave his cold, haughty mistress. Only the extinction of all hope could have completely deadened his affection. Hope stood at his right hand ; and even under the lingering mortification of her former refusal, he was eagerly counting the chances and calculating the best moves to obtain a reversal of the sentence, and crown Margaret as his queen in this tower of Dunfermline. \"My lord,\" remarked an observant friend, \"yonder comes a party from the English boat.\" Malcolm cast a keen glance down the path. His eyes were never lack lustre or dull. His brown cheek flushed ; he uncovered as he started forward : \"Lady Margaret, without palfrey or litter, by herself; neither mother nor brother with her! Now this savours of such sweet, calm, fearless condescension as I may well fear. No matter, we will at \\east try if we cannot match her in courtesy.\" Margaret in an instant recognised him among his escort, richly clad as he was. She did not swerve aside,"], [23, "Saint Margaret. 11 though her cheek, as was its wont when agitated, grew white, and not maidenly red. The pupil of her eye dilated, and her delicate nostril quivered, as she said : \" My lord, we were richer once than now we are, though our fortunes have never been great since the heathen Dane invaded Saxon England. I come as a beggar to claim alms of your Christian kindness and royal charity. We need victuals till the storm is over, lest we exhaust our supply ; but the plainest and coarsest will suffice us. Ship-carpenters also we need to repair our damage, that we may sail with the first fair wind from this Scotwater, into which we have trespassed. Then we will row across the German Ocean to the Low Countries, and take horse for many weeks through friendly tracts, till at last we reach our mother Hungary.\" She would have knelt to him where he stood with a lowly obeisance, such as suited her situation and her petition. \" Nay,\" he said, \" Lady Margaret, my cousin\u2014 for I count kin with all of the race of Cerdic since they shel tered me in my adversity \u2014 you can never come as a beggar to me. Lady Margaret can never be anything but the sovereign and I the subject; for I never change rela tions. Madam, bethink you it is cruel to remind me that it is only because you are poorer than of yore that you claim my good will.\" He spoke very gently, but with something of sarcasm, and Margaret looked wist fully into his face expecting more to follow. He could not abide the supplicating glance ; he took her hand with all friendship and respect. \" Let us have no more idle formality. What will you have of me, Lady Mar-"], [24, "Days of Yore. 12 garet? Shall your kinsmen come up and join you and laste of my hunting fare ? Shall the ladies of my nobles attend you ? We will summon them on the moment. Will you return to the boat, and permit me to ride behind you ? or mount the best bred gelding, and suffer me to lead the bridle rein ? Our broken ways are not fit for women's tender feet. Sumpter horses will follow with meat and ale, and mead and wine. I would they were more dainty for your sake ; they have only been prepared for men's rude appetites. I would I had books and plays to rightly entertain you, Lady Margaret ; but you know my scant capacity, and you will take the will for the deed. Ask what you will, even to my crown and sceptre \u2014 they are yours to accept from my poor hand.\" She bent her stately head, and trembled all over, smitten with his magnanimity, and in his quick ear she murmured low, \" My Lord and King.\" II.\u2014 THE SAINT. The \"Dragon\" had long sailed with its precious freight from the Scotwater, but ere that day Margaret had been wedded to the Cean Mohr with all dignity and splendour, at the tower by the winding stream. Years had passed away, changes had come to the little hamlet which once clustered so simply round the King's Tower. Dunfermline, destined to join several interests, was growing fast. Malcolm and Margaret, impressed with the obligation David felt and Solomon fulfilled,"], [25, "Saint Margaret. 13 were rearing the first stone version of the grand abbey, and endowing its prior afresh. They were likewise building, in a still lovelier nook of Pittencrieff Den, that palace of Margaret's in which, long centuries after, the crone saw the mystic cloak flung over the cradle of Charles the Martyr, and where Elizabeth Queen of Hearts wielded her baby sceptre \u2014 the lightest she ever bore. Then was laid the foundation of those relics \u2014 thorn of Wallace, Bruce's sword and tomb, royal aumry and memories of Anne the royal milkmaid \u2014 which form the strangest confluence of picturesque reminiscences. Margaret was now a wife and a mother, faithful and beloved. Some would say this might have sufficed her. As a woman it did suffice \u2014 for Margaret's ardent retum of her husband's regard was well known. And it is told too, that when, in after times, they translated her bones and disposed them in the casket encrusted with precious stones provided for their reception by her grandson, the bones of Margaret miraculously caused the procession to halt dutifully until those of Malcolm were also diligently gathered and placed in the same chest ; and when this had been done they presented no further impediment to the march. But Margaret had been instructed that penance and mortification, and lavish alms, and acts of devoted will, framed the way to heaven. Tenderly benevolent, as all generous natures must be, she was also inclined un consciously to a sort of platonic philosophy, and this, wedded to the monasticism that had grown up in the atmosphere of Rome, produced peculiar results. Mar-"], [26, "Days of Yore. 14 garet trod that narrow road not weakly but with a stern bravery, as she had in other days borne her own burden, and gone to face Malcolm in his fortress. A horror and repugnance of self-indulgence had grown up in her. She had a burning zeal for God's service. She had a fear of herself and her own overflowing affections. She could not impoverish their objects, but she could stint herself: she could balk her own heart, she could famish it and scourge it, as, alas ! she did sometimes famish and scourge her pure queenly body ! Margaret ate her pulse and drank her water, while she cooked Malcolm's favourite dishes and served them wit her own glad hands, as Isabella of Castile was fain to stitch for her Ferdinand. Malcolm slumbered soundly after his day's hard exercise, and Margaret would gently smooth down his pillow, and then turn her to the oratory, where the dim lamp burned, and the iron crncifix stood, and she would lay herself down at its foot, and tell her beads, and recall her sins, until the dim morning waked Malcolm to the cheery hunt. Then he would enter the oratory with hasty step and clouded brow, and lift Mar garet up, cold, and stiff, and faint. He would then peevishly bid her pray more in moderation, and be saintly in proper season. And she would cry out in anguish at his transgression, till he was like to curse himself, thinking of the aves, the credos, and the shrifts the loving and unflinching wife would inflict on herself in secret to save him, the strong man, from the con sequences of his hasty words. Malcolm could have borne the loss of her company,"], [27, "Saint Margaret. 15 for he was magnanimous. He could even have over looked the disadvantage to the state in the king or queen not only being above the world, but living out of the world, thus encouraging a state of mind which would readily put the vow before the altar in opposition to the profit of commerce, trade, or agriculture, or even of what seemed social weal. He even consented to alienate rich crown lands for the devout friars and sisters whom Margaret loved ; and he listened patiently to prolix arguments with the followers of the Culdees in the royal presence. He smothered all his doubts in the obstinate conviction that his Margaret must be right. He even brought himself to witness his beautiful and learned Margaret in her hospital, and walked after her humbly, as of old, while she bound up the loathsome wounds, raised the fevered heads, and moistened the parched lips ; and the tears gushed from his eyes as he knelt to her in her closet, and begged her to bless him, her unworthy husband. But when Margaret introduced to Malcolm his young blooming daughter Maud \u2014 another Margaret, only un tried and untroubled \u2014 with the novice's veil cumbering and shading, like widow's weeds, her open brow, then the much-enduring monarch strode up to the child, im petuously rent the veil away, and wrathfully forbade, oil pain of his lasting displeasure, that Maud should wear the gloomy badge. It was to him the token of the lengthening and broadening chilly shadow which was separating him from the bride of his fancy, the wife of his manhood \u2014 his beautiful Margaret and peerless queen."], [28, "Days of Yore. 16 Margaret weeps and groans, Malcolm rages and storms. Angry frowns meet stately sullenness; and alienation, opposite pursuits, violent extravagancies, excess and re morse, tread swiftly on each other's heels. Nothing but error and sorrow. Are such misunder standings to be the end? Malcolm's wholesome heart was changed to gall. He begins to doubt all goodness, to regard all religion as hypocrisy. The Cean Mohr must surely have lent himself to mean and false councillors ere he could consent to dog Mar garet's steps, gliding into secrecy. He must have fed his nature with doubt ere he could have sworn that no mortal could thus abstract herself from the living, breathing, rejoicing world, and continue carrying for ever the load of sin, mourning and watching, and laying on herself fresh punishments, without some influence of earth min gling with the stream of worship. He thought there was but a step bridging a frightful chasm between these false restraints and unhallowed licence; for nature rebelled against such a regime, and, just to herself, broke out in foul sores. The convents and religious houses had seen it. The high places had been stained. But if he had been deceived, basely betrayed \u2014 woe to the day i Mad with regret \u2014 the gnawing pangs of \"rue\" wasting his vitals \u2014 the King rose from his bed one dewy summer's morning, and followed Margaret, whose footsteps through the gate were reported by the warden. Down the wooded ravine he went, and along a faintly worn foot path, such as might guide a constant lover to a daily tryst, Then he broke into a track which winded over the"], [29, "Saint Margaret. 17 purple ground-ivy, and by the feathery bracken under the cream-coloured stems of the dark fir-trees. The birds were beginning their matins before the bells of the priory rang out from the round tower rising above the thatched roof. The cony, with lurching leaps, scoured over the tree roots, and the squirrel nimbly scampered up the branches. The blue mist rolled from the hills of Cleish, but in Malcolm's heart there wa no peace, no gladness. He held his sword clenched in his grasp ; his teeth chattered in the freshness of the dawn. The skirt of Margaret his queen, the mother of his chil dren, floated before him through the trees, and as sure as the summer sky was blue above them, he was guilty before her. He could not but dimly feel that he was com mitting against her an act of unknightly and unkingly suspicion, and was imagining against innocence a cruel falsehood, and meditating murderous violence. Beyond the ravine, to the north of the tower, the mount in the Den of Pittencrieff extended its ridge. In its rocky declivity there was a passage from below which penetrated into a recess or hollow scooped out of the solid rock, and forming a cave high enough for a man to stand upright in, long enough for a restless foot to pace it, and containing a natural fountain in the farther cleft, which rendered its uneven floor damp, and slipper}'', and cold as the tomb, even in the balmy summer season. Malcolm stole to its mouth, scarce rustling the gravel ; there, truly, knelt Margaret, her ebony crucifix before her, the profane world, wich its disturbance, and taunts, and revilings, which had latterly broken in upon her c"], [30, "18 Days of Yore. devotions, removed far from her. Even in the depth of winter, when the way was crisp with hoar-frost, and the cave hung round with blue gleaming icicles, she had held her tryst ; and, kneeling with her delicate limbs on the rugged rock, her face buried in her auburn hair, or raised upwards in an ecstacy, she sought to realise in her heart how the Divine Man bore the world's anguish. Malcolm stood transfixed. He heard Margaret as she prayed, dreaming of no human presence, calling out for mercy on her pride, her earthliness, beseeching that she might be purified as by fire, that she might bring light to her brave, true Malcolm and their little children. Malcolm turned and fled. He would have slain a rival ruthlessly, he would have sobbed out his heart's blood sooner than have yielded or asked quarter ; but what had he to do with such business as this ? Why had he, with his unclean tread, come to the very gate of heaven? Malcolm vowed a vow as he hurried in dis order homewards, the sweat-drops falling from his grizzled locks, and his stalwart body panting with exhaustion. He would pluck out the tongue that ever again wagged with the most artfully concealed slander against his Margaret \u2014 that ever again remotely aspersed her white loyalty and faith. He would amend his ways ; he would cease to wound and offend her ; and since in her angelic endurance, her nobleness and kindness, she tolerated his brutality, he would strive to grow better, and braver, and purer. He would withdraw his mean distrust, and his hard persecution, and honour her and her Christianity, rapt and mystic as it was to his coarse and dull perceptions."], [31, "Saint Margaret. 19 So the next time Margaret was absent in the capital, Malcolm sent masons and architects to the cave, caused it to be hewn into a commodious though solemn chamber, built-in the spring that it might not flood the floor; had it strewn every morning, with rushes in winter, and flowers \u2014 gillyflowers and roses \u2014 in summer ; and carved in it that fair table, with a grand crucifix, the wonder of many pilgrims, who came from the sea-surrounded Ork neys and the oaks of the Nith, from France, and from Italy itself, to say their orisons where Saint Margaret had once knelt and prayed. How Margaret's grey eyes must have dilated with wonder, how her lips must have parted with amazement, when first she revisited the cave, thus swept and gar- nished for her retirement by her husband's devotion. Coupling this change with his late gentleness, her wit would come nigh to the truth, and, with a crimson brow and weeping eyes, she would bless her husband in his humiliation, and thank God for his recall from the borders of the waste howling wilderness of riot, tyranny, and wickedness. A light dawned upon her which she could not shut out, though it is true she received it tremblingly and hesitatingly. She feared at first that it might be an ignis faluns of the earth; but, having first seen it in this cave in the hill while she knelt before the crucifix, she at last took it as an illumination from Heaven. She stretched out her arms to it where it .hone on her own home, or her women's looms and wheels, on her children's cradles, and by her husband's chair, and over his bowed head.

King Malcolm and Queen Margaret had been to gether all the morning ; they had been hawking with the highly-prized Peregrine falcons, natives of this corner of their dominions. They had been standing at one of the unglazed windows of the tower watching a troop of poor folks returning from the porch of their Priory with alms (omen of the future of Wellwood and Halbeath !) \u2014 frag ments of \" black stone,\" \" very good for firing,\" \" with which they went away contented.\" Now they were in their audience chamber, receiving under the dais various foreigners of rank, and traders who desired grants from Malcolm. They were much oftener than ever before as sociated together in their duties and recreations, and the Court and country were smiling under the broad sunshine and sweet harmony. The Pope's legate was here to-day; there were also a few calculating Germans, who had strayed from the steel-yards in London, and were willing to begin their commerce near the mouth of the Scotwater, in the low-browed stone houses of Edinburgh, under the shelter of the Castle. There were also men of Danish descent, from the debatable territory of Northumberland,"], [33, "Saint Mar (fare t. 21 extending disputed homage to the Cean Mohr. But it was with an English envoy from the former Duke of Normandy that the royal couple had most concern. Margaret bore no love to the invader. Very grudg ingly and warily, even apart from his sympathy with Margaret in her feeling, had Malcolm made alliance with the eagle that had swooped down on England. Any day the fancy struck him he might flap his wings and extend his flight to Scotland, and try his beak and talons with the claws and muzzle of the Cean Mohr. This Norman messenger was dissatisfied with his somewhat cold recep tion ; and, besides, he was piqued at the loss of a wager with Malcolm at the bear-baiting which the King had introduced as one of his amusements, after the fashion of the gentle Confessor himself. With the proverbial Norman audacity and insolence, he scrupled not to sneer openly when Malcolm, on the arrival of an important despatch from a distant quarter of his kingdom, and in the absence of his clerkly confessor, employed Margaret to decipher the scroll. Nor did he otherwise when Malcolm found it necessary to issue a warrant on its authority, and was forced to append his handwriting, or seal, without the Queen's intervention \u2014 writing the word with such pause and sigh, such squaring of arms, and clumsy, sluggish, yet irksome travel of the pen over the parchment, and with such result of crooked, cramped, and at the same time colossal letters, looking as though they had been formed of unbarked wood, bent and gnarled on the bough.

The Cean Mohr flung down the document testily, and turned aside his head on seeing Margaret watching him with earnest eyes, and masking her mortifi cation at his failure by attempting to draw off the atten tion of the English knight, and to entangle him in con versation. She was asking rapid questions about London, Essex, Kent, the Thames, the Severn, Matilda and her children, and how it fared with the disputes between them and their iron father, though she knew each answer touched old wounds. Malcolm was not vindictive. When his fury was not upon him, he was more placable than the meanest. He would not condescend to chastise even this Sir Aylmer, but he was vexed to think that Queen Margaret might be grieved when she thought of the report the Norman would carry back to her few friends in her native land regarding the incorrigible, unredeemable rudeness of her husband Malcolm the Scot. \" The malicious, presuming robber,\" Margaret ex claimed, in her irritation, the moment Sir Aylmer's back was turned, \" he abuses the footing to which neither law nor right entitled him. He was softer and smoother when I last saw him bending and fawning before Edward's cowl.\" \" Nay, Margaret, let him laugh ; he laughs best who laughs last over his horse's head, or behind his sword's point and his helmet's bars.

Oh ! my husband, triumph over their petty book-craft as you triumph over their guile and their crooked ways in your manliness and frankness.\" \" Alack-a-day ! my Margaret,\" answered Malcolm, laughing, yet flushing with pride and pleasure, \" you over rate your poor goodman. I am too old, too hot, too wilful and stubborn, and too unaccustomed to contradic tion or control. None of your priests or friars would suffer me ; even Father Ambrose and good Turgot would give me up as an incorrigible dullard and an impious rebel.\" \" Not so, they would be only too proud to aid the king ; but if you will not test their reverence, take my poor skill for thy guide, and leave Father Ambrose and Turgot to Edward and Ethelred, and to little Maud, who will illumine missals fairly for a woman. Dost thou fear to betray my duty, King Malcolm, and to render me bold ; or canst thou not spare a moment's leisure to honour thy wife and to vindicate her pride in thee ? \" \" By the mass, Margaret, we will find the time, since thou hast such faith in my heavy brains,\" cried Malcolm, fervently; and, cost him what it might \u2014 his indolence,"], [36, "Days of Yore. 24 I elderly supineness, fetters of habit, chagrin at his old folly, and confusion at the comments of his comrades \u2014 he kept his word. And Malcolm having wedded no chattering sparrow or wren of one note, was Margaret's lover to the last day of his existence : he coveted her company, craved her approbation, and was happy in her praise and admiration long after her auburn locks were streaked with grey, and her fair, pale face was furrowed with years. The legend tells that he quitted his feasts, that he overcame the sloth, and resisted the excess, to which stiff joints and a mind only capable of using the broad book of Nature so tempted him in the long winter nights, when the Mighty Volume was shut, and he could only feed his hawks and hounds, play with his jester, gossip with his nobles, or listen admiringly to his Margaret and fondle his children. In spite of all this passive entertain ment, however, his very jaws would have cracked with portentous yawns ; which, had he not been an upright man, might have foreboded a mad expedition to the Holy Land, or a sudden aggression on a next-door neighbour, on the spring, like a wolf or a bear, to welcome him. He re-arranged his evening pastimes, and adopted fresh occupations. He entered Margaret's bower, where her elder boys were listening to her instructions, her maidens at work, her minstrel singing, or her monk of the evening reciting his miracle. And in place of claiming the deference of all and overturning their engagements, or listening drowsily to the lulling voice of poet or priest he hurried to the table set apart for his studies. There he"], [37, "Saint Margaret. 25 traced the lines and completed the curves, and read passages with an honest diligence, only succeeded by a merry mischief when he had grown full weary. There Margaret bent over him devotedly, applauded his feats, encouraged him in his despondency, and corrected his blunders. Nay, she sometimes even slapped the kingly cheek full playfully, or pulled away the parchment, when he would make sport of his task, telling him gravely he might seek another clerk. She never failed, however, to be at his command next night, when, grave and indus trious, he came once more eagerly, joyfully, and hope fully to his studies. Whether Malcolm lived to become a scholar under so rare a teacher, or whether that bloody battle in Nor thumberland interrupted the old man's lessons, is not on record. It is certain, however, that years after, Margaret, 1} \"ing in Edinburgh and hearing the tidings that her Malcolm had been slain on the field, and that her eldest son Edward had died of his deep arrow-wound the day after the battle, desired urgently to confess her sins and bless her surviving children. Her spirit passed without delay to join her best beloved before her Lord ; and her body was piously stolen from a postem door by her son Ethelred, just as Donald Bane, the second usurper in Scottish history, was thundering at the main gate of the castle. What wonder that, dwelling on Margaret's virtues and pondering with dazzled eyes on her sanctity, they should canonize her, translate her bones at the Reformation to Douay, and still cherish relics of her in the Escurial ?"], [38, "26 Days of Yore.

TV/T Y story refers to a remote time. William the Norman had not yet won the field of Hastings and founded the Abbey of Battle to atone to God and man for the day of bitterness, the day of death. Bede's tomb was yet new in its shrine at Durham, and good St. Cuthbert, and stout St. Dunstan, and holy St. Columba were patrons and friends to English and Scotch alike. As yet eels and swine paid the rental of much land in the woods and morasses of England. The monks culti- vated choice vines, and Bishop Adhelm harped cunningly on his harp to win hearers to his sermons. Vast forests then surrounded London itself, their recesses sheltering herds of wild beasts, whose ravages justified the dreary Saxon name of Wolf-Monat, applied to the month of January. Edinburgh consisted of a rude fortress and one long, continuous, steep street. The houses were mostly one-storeyed, and built of solid blocks of stone, with some higher wooden structures, or thatch-roofecl, turf-walled huts, but there was neither palace nor abbey. The"], [40, "28 Days of Yore. Water of Leith was a clear country stream, and herons might still have been seen standing by the Black Rock, and hawks cutting the air over Arthur's Seat. A hunted man lay in a weym or cave, on the coast of Fife, in hiding from his enemies, and in watch for a chance of escape. This cave was no common den or earth-hole into which a fox might burrow ; it was worthy the name, and worthy the man who lay there days and nights, while the wind howled in the crannies, and the waves dashed into the gulley. It was formed by a mighty scoop in the high coast-line, built-in by great boulders and huge fragments of rock on the land side, and open seawards. Time, which has worked wide changes elsewhere, has done little here. It is true the coast-line has altered somewhat, tides and currents have followed its lead ; and the cave, which then was inacces sible at high water and in stormy seas is regularly flooded twice a day, even as far as the remains ot the thick wall reared across the steep entrance by the exigences of the contraband trade in those busy days of coast smuggling, when yeomen drank claret as well as their lairds. But otherwise the scene is unchanged. The invincible bul warks of the land guard rich terraced fields of old brake and shingle, named locally, in all modesty, \" the braes,\" \" the sea braes,\" \" king-craig braes.\" The turf, softest of short close verdure, clings to the sombre grey rock, and the green is relieved by patches of yellow moss, veins of white or pink spar, as simple tongues will term it, splashes of white or green from gathering stalactites, and the pale fawn grey, where the rocks are encrusted"], [41, "Shadows ou the Coast of Fife. 29 with barnacles. The prevailing colours are, however, the blue of the foreground, the vivid green and sober grey behind ; and chaste, grand, grave, yet not gloomy beauty belongs to these vast, irregular, motionless stony forms, which, associated with the stillness of the shore, the monotonous sound of the water, the freedom and purity of the air, and the absence of leafy tremulous shade, affect the spectator as would a group, chiselled in tintless marble, defying the rainbow brilliance. The coast scene was much the same to the hunted man as to the civilised, educated pleasure-seeker of to-day; it had the same loneliness, the same solemnity, the same fixed faithfulness. The shells lie white and cheerful on the yellow sands, or among the crumbled down, well-nigh black \" trap.\" The face of one rock is ribbed aslant, as though one of the geologist's icebergs had crashed past and torn it thus ages agone ; another is perforated and drilled as by round shot ; while a third is clean cut, as a mason or miner will \" slap \" the wall of pit or quarry. One detached fragment there was, black and green, which assumed the figure and attitude of a lion couchant in its bath; but when you have reached and doubled it, then, like the monsters in enchanted halls, it dissolves into ridged rock of ordinary substance, shape, and shadow, no more resembling a maned lion than a horned unicorn. Twin flowers have blossomed here for nearly a thousand years, their bright lips salt with spray. There is the crane's bill geranium, convol vulus sized, and of a C\u00e6sar's purple ; stunted wild roses, indemnifying themselves for their dwarfish foliage and"], [42, "Days of Yore. 30 stainless white blossoms by their wealth of thorns ; blue bells, unlike the roses, the largest of their kind, true helmets of St. George ; green and yellow stonecrop, and pale blue oyster-plant, creeping among the stones ; lilac sea-rocket, washed and blown almost colourless; and rich amber crowfoot, and rosy sea-pink, stuck here and there as bouquets in the rough rock, or nodding in tufts from topmost pinnacles. Here are ferns, too, in summer ; and in spring golden cowslips gladden the whole line of braes. Through jutting crags runs the same defile as the refugee looked upon. There are the same toothed fur rows running into the sea, the farthest terminating in the invariable long, low, peak-crested islet, the single column rising sheer from the waves, and standing like the solitary shaft of some ruined cathedral. There are the same shallows and ripples and zone of olive-brown weed ; the same sudden turn before the entrance of the cave, the lofty hollow into the hill scooping out the blue sky as well as the grey rock. The opposite rocks are yet more f; ntastic, the foremost being a colossal unhewn dead gable, while the next has been slowly hewn by the water into double arches \u2014 huge misshapen arches, square at the summit, narrowing in the neck, and widening again below \u2014 suggesting the handicraft of rude Pictish artificers and Titan Calibans. Seen through these arches again is the blue sky or sea, or a strikingly new feature of the coast \u2014 fluted basaltic pillars, now high, now low, forming a final barrier. In the depth between, the rough stones of a loose causeway are churned in storms, and slowly rocked in calms.

It was the roughest of chambers, with low unequal sloping roof and walls closing in all round, save where the wide mouth, door and window in one, opened on the sea, disclosing the coast of Berwick, and awakening thoughts of England. If the scene is but little altered, the feelings which it inspires must be to a great extent uniform. Yes, truly, though the hunted man lay there, not dressed in broad cloth, hose, trews, and felt hat, with short clipped hair, and clean shaven chin, but clad in woollen tunic edged with embroidery, his mantle fastened on his shoulders with a ring, his legs swathed with cross bandages of cloth, his long yellow hair flowing from beneath his scanty cap, and falling in curls down his shoulders. The raiment or the fashion of hair could not have had much to do with it, nor even that other and closer garment of education, when there was the same strongly sentient human nature, the same impressionable imagination, and the same central figures of faith. No heathen was that man, though he carried his hunting knife in his girdle and could use it readily enough, and would eat his meat from the spit on which it was roasted. Through the galaxy of saint and angel, he recognised the very Triune Sun, before which all Christendom bends in adoration. A husband he was, and a father. Perhaps doubly, trebly dear were wife and children to the untrained,"], [44, "Days of Yore. 32 unexhausted, fierce, fond heart, with its narrow channels and its few passions. Doubtless he doated on his lady \u2014 the bread-giver \u2014 in her long trailing dress, and with her head muffled in the nunlike couvrechief, so significant of domestic retirement and peaceful occupations, when she went abroad. He would look admiringly on the spirited boys \u2014 on the heir who loved the feathers from the wild swan's wing and the black cock's tail, the horns from the stag, and the skin from the spotted snake, and on the boy whose eyes sparkled at sight of the priest's illumined missal, and on the little lad whose ears were charmed by the minstrel's song. He would lovingly regard his girls as they teased the boys, or waited upon them, or cleverly mimicked them, or most of all when they closely copied their mother. Doubtless the young ones were wont to meet the chief at his castle gate, to receive his booty, to be lifted on his horse, or to bestride his dogs. They would smile on his knee during the dark days and long nights of winter, when all was locked in the idleness of gale and torrent and snowdrift, just as children have done from time immemorial. We must not fall into the serious error of fancying that the primitive chief's primitive tower was comfortless and joyless in its day. It wanted much which our houses possess, but certes it might have owned what was needful for happiness ; and it did probably command, in its simpli city, some advantages 'hich we in our artificiality have lost. It was but a tower. The dungeons and cattle sheds were below, the hall above, and the sleeping closets high up beneath the battlements. If you add to this the"], [45, "Shadows on the Coast of Fife. 33 postern, the sally port and barbican, you have the utmost extent of accommodotion. But it had its warm hearth, its ingenious loom, its legend, or song, or sacred lesson. There was space enough in it for faith, hope, and charity. There was no absence of interest in the Wolf-Monat ; nor in the Kele-Monat, when the first herb was ready for the great pot ; nor in the Lenet-Monat, when every net, drag, and fishing-hook was abroad to relieve the house hold from the wearisome salt fish. There was excitement in the woods or on the water when state affairs were tranquil, when kingly parade or church ceremony did not supervene, and even when neighbourly friendship or neighbourly hostility did not afford keenest enjoyment, and draw forth the best or the worst tempers of the race. And from the season of Tri-Milki, whose name marks one of the sweet eras of rural life, on through Meyd-Monat, when the cattle stood knee-deep in the pastures, to the great harvest, and the slaughter of beasts and storing of fire-wood, and brewing of honey mead and barley ale, so many occupations and delights were condensed, that even the stationary lady rose from her stool or her couch, and in spite of her strange encumbering gear, led an open-air life for the short summer, at once softening and inspiring the retainers by her share in their daily toils and expe rience of their daily pleasures. Depend upon it there was a crowning bitterness in this man's cup when he remembered these things. He might now have been treading the fresh furrows, inspect ing the extermination of the corn marigold, or winding through the woods in their gayest, tenderest bravery, or D"], [46, "Days of Yore. 34 slinging off the first falcon with his lady; he might have been witnessing the last milking in the meadow, or the calling of the lambs into the fold ; while in sad reality he was crouching here stiff, chill, harassed, in great trouble and in bondage. He sat hearkening to the dash of the waves instead of to the tales of his fellows or the prattle of his children, and with no prospect of relief except in the forbidden help of poor fishermen, who might row him over the ferry, and so enable him to ride or run through \"Pichtland\" or \"Locthen,\" over the borders into England \u2014 more friendly, honourable, and stanch to the ancient allegiance on this disastrous occasion than was the kingdom of the Scots. The throb of exultation at the first sense of solitude and freedom, and then the contracting, aching, gradually overpowering conception of loneliness and powerlessness; these followed by fitful, trifling employments, inevitable fits of abstraction, and unreasonable, unbounded misery ; \u2014 all were experienced by the hunted man, just as they would be now by any solitary prisoner in deadly peril, waiting in one of the fastnesses of nature. Macduff had escaped from danger, and had left, exposed to havoc and destruction, his most valuable treasures. A horrible crime had been committed far to the north, away in Strathmore, which he could never sanction by sub mission or silence. Though the deed was done, and the usurper was too powerful and prosperous to be arraigned for public judgment and condemnation, the murdered king's subjects belonged to the fatherless, dispossessed lad with the host in Northumbria, and they were bound"], [47, "Shadows on the Coast of Fife. 35 to preserve for him their services, and offer to him their persons and powers, to aid him in his righteous ven geance. There was little time to hesitate and demur, to plot and to plan, even although hesitation and demurring, and plotting and planning for other than express siege or ambuscade, had been the fashion then. Macduff did not tear overmuch for dame and offspring, even if his castle were surrounded, and his gates invaded. The man asked his own manly, generous nature, and it answered him that the stern man, the hot aud passionate man, \" was yet mild to good men who loved God,\" and by consequence merciful to weak women and little children. The dark ages had their amenities amidst the constant warfare, which we are only too apt to lose sight of, because the exceptions are more prominently forced upon our notice. Macduff could not conceive that Macbeth, wise and wily as he was, would wantonly dip his hands in innocent blood, and so increase his black remorse and add to his difficulties. How should he guess that eating the evil fruit of the tree of knowledge blinds sense as well as humanity, destroys sagacity as well as benevolence ? The villain, having once taken the false step, blunders on till he ends by being at once brute and fool. But Macduff had sick misgivings and dim wretched fore bodings. He sometimes thought of a woman turned out without shelter or defence to wander in the darkness and chill of night, or of a wild mother screaming o'er her famishing brood, a spectacle not uncommon in these and d 2"], [48, "36 Days of Yore. the times just preceding. It required all the strength of his manhood to resist the vain impulse given by these fancies. No living creature could have breathed a more wretched, hampered existence ; he dared not move abroad by day when the tide was back, and by night, even when the moon shone out, he saw only the white glimmer on the grim stone lion, or the faint line of the sandy bents, or the silver foam of the waves. If, at imminent risk, he scaled the neighbouring heights, difficult to climb even at full noon, a world of black waving tree-tops, a bay, and, if the night was clear, a conical hill, bounded his field of vision. His own castle lay to the east, in the hollow where the springs fed his moat, but even the smoke from his chimneys was not discernible above the waste of wood. Pinched with hunger, and overcome with anxiety, the profit Elijah by the brook Cherish was hardly more straitened than this man. And he would have fared hardly had there not been as gallant spirits as himself among the hynels and ceorls of the fishing hamlet A proclamation had been issued for bidding the natives of the coast to nourish the rebel, or to expedite his slight, on pain of life and limb. Yet, night after night, the neighbouring fishermen stole along in the shadow of the rocks, in one or other of their high prowed boats, and cast into his den cured fish, barley bread, goats' flesh, and even skilfully floated in sealed vessels of milk and ale, and billets of firewood. They had gone the length of binding themselves, on the first free hour, when the enemies' boats were off the watch, to cut out into the open Frith and pass him across, where strong"], [49, "Shadows ou the Coast of Fife. 37 limb and stout heart, sword and shield and hired horse would be something. Three days and nights had come and gone, and the agony of the watch in the changeless solitude became almost intolerable. To plunge into the blue or grey waters and be seen no more, and so escape the cord or the axe ; or to rise and speed to his castle, and there learn the worst, were strong, almost irresistible tempta tions. But to do either was to leave young Malcolm forlorn in his misfortunes, to bid him cleave his way back to his father's throne single-handed. No, the refugee must swallow his own bitter morsel, and endure his own burden patiently, that the higher weal might be preserved. The public good must have been recognised by Pict and Scot, Saxon and Norman, just as by Whig and Tory, Liberal and Conservative. Sometimes he would hear the dash of an oar, or the dis tant bark of a dog, and raise his haggard head, deeming his deliverance nigh. He would say to himself that he exaggerated mischances, and invented accidents, and affrighted himself like any child ; and at the word \"child\" he would venture from his cavity and gather the sounding shells and glistening stones, and store them in his pouch for his children in the castle buried in the wood. The spring night was misty ; the creeping fog came in and hid the land, and the beleaguered captive crouched ex pectant and eager. The thin curling vapour from the fire, which he was forced to maintain to protect joints and marrow from the piercing sea-damp, was lost in the general fog. The waves were rolling in unseen with a"], [50, "38 Days of Yore. hollow boom. He could not sleep, and the despairing dreams which had haunted him were banished by his feverish wakefulness. He still saw his loving dame, but she was praying before the crucifix with a heavenly face, and boy and babe clustered round her, and rose into the air above her head. The pensive, heated stupor was broken suddenly by something stirring in the water near him : it paddled, puffed, and approached him, all alone in this den, in the darkness of night. His hair rose, his skin crept, and the perspiration gathered on his brow. He thought of the deluding mermaid, of the dreaded sea-serpent, of the sea horse and old dragon. He was weary of this wild cave, impatient of its thraldom and its languor ; yet the next moment he handled his sword, and bent forward for the terrible encounter. But surely he had seen that brown head and deep neck, and those broad paws before ! It was his own wolf-hound Thor, which had been held back by main force when he left the castle. Right loyal vassal ! He had tracked his master's footsteps where none else dared to follow. He was welcome, a thousand times welcome ! But when the master put forth his hand to pat his favourite, his hand touched blood on the creatures shoulder, blood that no water could have washed away, for it slowed apace from a spear wound not yet stanched. Thor was well trained, sedate, stately, and would meddle in no ordinary fray. The dame had said she would command Thor to lie down by her matronly seat, and he would stay there till Macduff returned. What"], [51, "Shadows on the Coast of Fife. 39 then had brought him here? His coat was frayed and scorched, as if he had come through fire as well as water, and as his master examined him, the good dog, in place of bounding and barking, fixed his liquid eyes piteously on the face he loved, and uttered a long lamentable howl that shook the cave and trembled away over the water. \" Now God have mercy ! I can bide this no longer,\" cried Macduff starting up, and eagerly buckling his sword-belt. Just then he heard the muffled splash of oars and creak of helm, and a subdued chorus smote his ear. He listened ; it was the ferrymen, and soon his allies' boat hove in sight, and pushed rapidly forward to the mouth of the cave. \" Come off, master ; there is not a moment to be lost. It is as mirk in the Frith as a moonless December, and unless we be run down by some other craft, we'll be in Pichtland long ere the morning break.\" Without a word, Macduff with his four-footed attendant sprang into the boat, and moodily he sat while the men shoved off quickly, and rowed in smothered excitement. In a little while the veil of mist, to their deep vexation, drew aside, and the young May moon looked down upon them. Cold came the night blast sighing and soughing over the wide ocean by St. Andrew's shrine, ruffling the broad Frith. Coldly looked the pale new moon on the speck of a boat, rocking as it sailed faster and faster. The shadowy faces of the men, sharpened by anxiety and worn with labour, also looked wan and cold. The last"], [52, "Days of Yore. 40 moon had shone unmoved on Duncan's monstrous murder, under the sanctuary of his chosen subject's roof. This young moon, a dainty crescent, had witnessed the rifled home, and hearth, and altar. Macduff divined all, and his heart was heavy, and his brain wild to madness. \" Hold on, my men,\" cried the steersman, \" put your shoulders to the work, else we may fall, master and man together, into those fell hands.\" \" Nay, let us all sink together to the bottom rather,\" answered Macduff, suddenly rising up and nearly cap sizing the boat. The men paused and stared in amazement. They were a remarkable race, these ferrymen, and bore foreign features, as they had done for ages. They had not the tawny hair, ruddy flesh, and stalwart proportions of the Dane, but the bold black eye and the hawk nose, which later came across the Channel to conquer England. They were not bluff, cleanly, riotous Flemings, like the Buckhaven fishermen, but arrogant, vaunting, aggressive Normans, with the free Norse blood fermented and quickened on the French shore. Not always trustworthy, they were untamable and clannish to excess. They gazed blankly at the chief. \" Is this what we have come out for ? \" they demanded excitedly. \" We might have saved ourselves our trouble, ay, and stinted our loss. Cuthbert is a widow's son, and Rollo has weans half a score, and Patrick was wed by the priest of Saint Mary's this very sunset.\" Macduff sank down; keenly he felt their reproach.

No mother's son shall be lost to her if I can give him a cast on his sorrowful way ; no poor soul shall suffer for lack of masses ; no humble man's petition shall fail in reaching my lord the king's ears, if a king's breath which is in his nostrils can avail him.

I. \u2014 the rencontre \u2014 family matters rightly discussed. TN the winding streets of the ancient burgh of Crail, with its posts and gates formed of drift-wood and whales' jaws, and itself as salt-flavoured as the neigh bouring German Ocean, there walked, in the time of good Queen Bess, a grave young man of thirty, in a sober but richly embroidered cloak and velvet cap. He was one of those Melvilles whose names are so famous in the history of the Scottish Kirk \u2014 James, nephew of the courageous Andrew. They were men of learning, con dition and birth, claiming not only kinship with the Melvilles of Carnbee and Dysart, but even a distant share of kingly lineage through John of Gaunt, \" time honoured Lancaster.\" They had spirit and wit, too, though small in body, that famous uncle and nephew. Andrew was fiery and irresistable, \u2014 \"a blast,\" as he was sagaciously defined; while James was regarded by the"], [55, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 43 time-servers and double-dealers, the cowards and traitors of the day, as still more dangerous, though he was the hope of the milder and more peaceable patriots of all opinions, because he was a \" crafty byding man.\" They were like each other in person, and warmly attached with the reverential relation of father and son, and the con fidential bond of an equal friendship. James, with loving vanity, writes that he \"would to God he were as like Mr. Andrew in gifts of mind, as he is thought to be in proportions of body and lineaments of face ; for there is none, that is not otherwise particularly informed, but takes me for Mr. Andrew's brother.\" Slight, spare men, but tough in warfare, stanch in endurance, with faces full of intellect and will ; trained not only to play the part of mental athletes, but to make the best of their scanty flesh. Mr. James, when he writes of his school and school-mates, the \" gentle, honest men's bairns in the country about,\" not only records their lessons in \" letters and godliness,\" but in \" honest games,\" and particularises for the future information of those to whom Presbyterian ism is an altogether harsh and austere profession, \" that there also we had the air guid, and fields reasonable fair, and by our maister were teached to handle the bow for archerie, the club for goff, the batons for fencing, also to rin, to leepe, to swoum, to warsell, to prove pratteiks, everie ane having his match and antagonist baith in our lessons and play.

There was nothing of the scarecrow or thread-paper about Andrew when he led the belligerent Assembly, or about James when he addressed the secretly sympathising English Council, who might accept and honour a bench of bishops of their own free will, but whose mingled Norman and Saxon blood formed a puddle far too saucy for the doctrine of the divine right of kings, and the imposition of this or that form of worship in the teeth of the worshippers. The Melvilles, knit by hereditary friendship to Erskine of Dun, John Knox, and Buchanan, were strong both in the kirk and the schools, but especially in the kirk, with its high authority and broad aspirations \u2014 then one of the great arenas of Scottish ambition, where scions of the gentry fought as gallantly under their banners of love and charity as their brethren beneath their bloody ensigns in the fields of \"hie Germany\" during the Thirty Years War; or their fathers following the watch-words of the Lords of the Congregation against Mary of Guise and her Cardinal Beatoun. But the Melvilles were not ambitious in the low grovelling sense. Violent they might be, arrogant, rude in measure, for their enemies have styled them so ; but even their enemies have never accused them of mercenariness and meanness. More unselfish men, less covetous, truer to their principles at"], [57, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 45 any cost, more generous and kindly in their domestic relations, more godly in their lives, hardly existed ; and the kingdom of Fife keeps to this da}', in a faint odour of gratitude, the solid facts, which attest that to the liberal hands of James Melville of Kilrenny and William Scott of Cupar, it owes a quaint manse and a fair spire. That strange little town of Crail was grey and still enough nigh three hundred years ago, and the keen searching air was snell indeed this ripe October. But Mr. James, though he drew his cloak around him, faced it with the enjoyment of a persevering, wholesome spirit, and passed on, acknowledged respectfully on all sides, and looked after occasionally as a man to be seen on a white day. Men of influence and authority were in particular request at that moment, for the times were especially precarious. The terror of the Armada rested on the land. Andrew Melville had been speaking and preaching against the dreaded invasion to students and burghers, before the king and the foreign ambassadors, until town-house and country-place, farm and cottage, were awake to the fonnidable news, and warned of the danger. It had been blazed about for a long time, and now, when its fulfilment was certain and close at hand, distracting rumours were rife of landings of the Spaniards at Dunbar, at St. Andrew's, at Aberdeen, in the Tay, and Cromarty Frith. Already Mr. James had been twice stopped and asked his last advice from the capital, and whether he would stay to encounter the vaunting, idola trous foe, or flee the coast till better times, when Mr. James replied, with animation, that he would abide with"], [58, "46 Days of Yore. his sea-faring men of the Anstruthers, who were as strong and sure as any Spaniard he had come across. They would fight for their faith and their wives and bairns, against the Pope of Rome and his slaves. But probably Mr. James was then less troubled at the thought of a struggle with the captains of the Armada than at the spectacle of an old lady, of precise and stately aspect, who sallied forth from a large square house, with many broad windows, set in the wide, weather-beaten, grass-grown street, and near to the cross, not yet plucked down. She approached as if to arrest his progress. He might escape the Armada, but he could not avoid his second cousin, Mistress Peggy Mel ville of Carnbee, and he would certainly be detained a while by her to receive her family confidences. He had been hurrying to the beach beyond the town, by the braes of prickly whins, to take counsel of nature as to the prospects of a storm. Moreover, he was now en gaged in the composition of \"The Seaman's Shout, or Mutual Exhortation to go forward in the Spirituall Voy age,\" which formed a contribution to the poetic half of his \"Spirituall Propine of a Pastour to his People.\" Along with the \" Godly Dream of my Lady Culross,\" the paraphrases of the Psalms, by Buchanan, Andrew Mel ville, and David Murray, and Apologias and Consola tios without number, this Propine formed the standard Scottish literature of the day. Peggy Melville's straight forward, pertinacious, somewhat overbearing statements and demands would sadly entangle the thread of his ideas ; but James Melville was more accustomed to be"], [59, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 47 interrupted than let alone, and would as soon have thought of being haughty and pettish to his mate Eliza beth Dury, or to his little Andrew or Anne, as to Mistress Peggy, one of his mothers, as he called her pleasantly. Peggy was a zealous supporter of the kirk, a bountiful friend in her potent independence and in fluence to a crowd of the poor and needy craftsmen and boatmen of Crail, and an admirer and lover, though he might deem her just a thought too much of a councillor, of his own unworthy self. So with just a little sigh, he delivered himself up, not without a twinge of his tender conscience that he should even have had an ungracious feeling to Mistress Peggy, to be hailed and laid hold of and turned about as she willed for the rest of his walk. Mistress Peggy Melville was as imposing a specimen of spinsterhood, as Mr. James was of his calling of a divine. She was big-boned and harsh featured, but with a certain native nobility about her large proportions which explained how it was her contemporaries insisted on her claims to good-looks in her time. But now, truly, she was but a striking relic of the past. She wore the fashion of her day, which was calculated to ex aggerate her peculiarities of size and air. Her dress was of green velvet, somewhat faded but still rich in texture, with a plaited farthingale bulging out her quaint sides above the long, armour-like, peaked stomacher encasing her waist. A ruff\" with its supertasse supported her neck, and the light red hair, which was still profuse and unstreaked with grey, frizzled, crisped, and laid in a"], [60, "48 Days of Yore. rope from ear to ear, and wreathed with silver ; and over the whole, with some regard to her years, she had the kircher of russet pinned beneath her chin. Thus attired, Mistress Peggy sailed along the street of Crail, with her maiden in flocket, hood, and pinners bearing her fan, her velvet bound gold-clasped Bible, and a basket of such donations as she might distribute on the instant to any of her dependents. \" I wish you gude day, Mr. James,\" cried the old lady, stopping short at once; \" a sicht of you is like the gift of a cordial, or essence more precious than common. I was on my way with Mariot to measure out the Widow Auchterlonie's duds, but the dead will keep while you and I take the air and hold some converse, which may the Lord send to our mutual edification.\" \" Amen, Mistress Peggy,\" answered James Melville, without the slightest shade of ridicule or insincerity. \"Well met, madam, what is your will with me to-day?\" said he, as he offered her his ruffled hand. So leading her carefully and tenderly, the two took their way to one of the promenades of Crail. \" I've muckle to tell you, Mr. James, and muckle to hear of your doings ; but first, Captain Joshua is to be in within eight days, and I'm thinking to beat up your quarters and wait him there, for the ' Lord Henry ' will not pass Anster; there is not water in the hole here to float her.\" Mr. James was almost relieved that Mistress Peggy did not dash at once into the hackneyed bugbear of the Armada, but at the same time he could not resist"], [61, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 49 drawing out her opinion on the subject. \"You'll be heartily welcome; my Lizzie will count herself highly honoured to have our brave, modest kinsman, Captain Joshua, again appearing to windward, as the nautical folk term it ; but will he not run some danger of falling in with the van or rear of King Philip's monster squadron, that is to bear down upon these islands and annihilate them, unless the Lord interpose in our behalf?\" Mistress Peggy stopped short in indignation. \" The Lord will hinder, and even He do not so \u2014 grant that he pardon me for speaking my mind, if it be presumption \u2014 do you think Joshua Melville and his protestant crew are not enough for a third, or a half, or the whole rout of these cattle?\" \" I believe it, if need were,\" James Melville assured her. \" Mistress Peggy, I admire thy constancy.\" \" There sud be no admiration going, sir ; there sud only be derision and wrath at the puny cubs, who are ready to flee to the hills and the caves because the King of Spain launches his hulks.

What business has she with Noes if we think fit to grant Ayes ?\" \"But, Mistress Peggy,\" urged James Melville, \"when God instituted marriage, he brought Eve direct to Adam for his approbation, acceptance, and peculiar portion \u2014 so it is written, A man shall leave father and mother and cleave to his wife; and again vice versa, let a woman make her own selection and abide faithful, body and soul, to her husband.

The one had been sick, and the other frolicsome,\" commented the imperturable minister, probably, in his heart, relieving himself by a breath of the good-natured scorn vented on the fantastic progeny of bachelor and spinster ; but he amended his reply with a sober bit of manliness, that discomforted even Mistress Peggy. \" We are frail humanity, Lizzie and I are incon sistent enough ; but it was the Lord that filled our quiver, and it is to our Master that we are answerable for the temper of the arrows. At the same time, Mistress Peggy, among great public concerns I behove to feel a near private interest in the affairs of my kinsman.

You'll speak to her as in your office, and bring her to her senses.

Though she could turn all Crail round her finger, she was well aware she could not move Mr. James a hair's breadth beyond his conscience. Being a little discontented, however, and lively withal, she tackled him on another course. \" When we are getting sic a fine, quiet turn, and sic a leisurely twa-handed discourse, I maun put it to you, is it possible, Mr. James, what they say of you : that you are so mad as to propose to break up your living, and gift awa your stipend, and let in two or three dominies that couldna find a footing for themselves, and who'll go over to the bishops as sure as they owe you their promo tion, and a black grudge for their ain insufficiency ?\" \" Mistress Peggy, you're a woman of sense.

If but one soul be missed out, woe to the shepherd, to the false, careless shepherd who lost the hundredth sheep !\" \" But you micht have helpers, Mr. James, by the score ; probationers, licentiates, and students would have been proud to serve an apprenticeship to sic a master, and they might have combined to labour under your"], [68, "56 Days of Yore. countenance, but now they will slip your hands at once, and manage or mismanage the district to their hearts' content.\" \" And mine, madam.

I have accepted a provision for myself and my household, so that I have not denied the faith, and been worse than"], [69, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 57 an infidel, as you hint, madam. For anything more, I can trust myself, my wife and bairns, and every friend I love, to Him who feedeth the young ravens when thy cry, and clotheth the lilies of the field in their beauty. God knows we may not have long to do with this heritage, we may be sent across the seas with better men, and, alas ! by far worse powers than this mighty but mistaken Prince James, whom we hoped to see our sworn friend. I mind yet, Mistress Peggy,\" continued Melville, melting into gentle recollections, \" how I saw his Grace walking up and down in the auld Lady Mar's hand, and heard him discourse 'of knowledge and ignorance,' to my great marvel, and how I, a stripling myself, held my prince ' the sweetest sight in Europe that day, for strange and extraordinary gifts of ingyne judgment, memory, and language.' But that was in his ninth year, and now when he's reached to man's estate, they say, when he comes in from hunting, he can find no better pastime than drinking to his dogs; notwithstanding, I take blame to myself that I am driven to judge my king, who had a harsh enough rearing ; \u2014 for his fair, beguiling, unhappy mother, within prison walls, still honoured my uncle Andrew, as he obeyed the hard carle, George Buchanan, and she has also spoken courteously to a mere country minister like me. Ah ! Peggy, we urgent, unceremonious, unflattering divines of the kirk of Scotland, would fain love King Jamie, if he would but consent to a free kirk, and abide men who have a will of their own, and reason and some little learning, to oppose to his sovereign wisdom.

Farther, as to what the world thinks of my judgment, and what you have alleged against my worshipful uncle and me, I do not fear to say that we are men to cope with straits, and pioneer followers as the Red Indians lead the white men in the New World.\" Mistress Peggy was vanquished, and actually betrayed into a burst of admiration. \" Oh ! you are a leal man, James Melville, and a faithful witness \u2014 but, oh ! man, man, I would have been keen to see you at the top of the tree, at the head of a troop of black cloaks, marshal ling them on to victory over the world, the flesh, and the devil, in this corner. Left to themselves, they'll pull different ways and fall asunder; make fules of themselves and a mess of the matter, and give ground for scandal. It's not to be thought that they'll all have so much as a preeing of the clear mind, the pure heart and the vigorous hand of John Knox and the Melvilles.\" Mr. James turned away sorrowfully. \"Oh, Mistress Peggy ! as if we were not unprofitable servants with the rest ; as if Knox never lifted his hand and cheered on what he would have given all he had to stop in the end ; as if he never covenanted with those who proved his Master's foes as well as the kirk's false friends. Oh, Mistress Peggy ! to exalt the weak faulty vessels, and lose sight of the glorious principle.\" But the old lady was incorrigible. \" Ye sud have held"], [71, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 59 the helm James Melville ; every seaman is not fit to steer ; you'll rue your folly.\" \" Never, madam ! though I had not a plack, and the king offered me one of his bishoprics \u2014 while I grant there be both pious and honest bishops in the sister kingdom\u2014 for myself I would refuse it that instant.\" \" Who spoke of bishoprics, Mr. James ? You might have ruled, as you were called to do, without being a prelate.\" \" A tulchan bishop say you ? The herd would do well to gore them, to see whether they are stuffed with flesh and blood, or chaff and straw; the same snare under another name, Mistress Peggy. For the surplice and the hood, the communion-rail and the altar, would stink as foully by different titles.\" Mistress Peggy said no more, but it went against the grain to hear this levelling doctrine applied to her heroes. The two were now strolling along the little footpath that winds round the low bank, sheltered with a border of gorse, rather rare on the sea margin of the east coast, but which here feathered the hillocks that sloped to the white sands. Just beyond was the long serried ridge of the Car Rock, where many a goodly vessel had foundered in spite of the huge fire lit nightly on its summit, and whose warning flame afforded a name to the ship of this Captain Robert, who had yet been evilly attracted to his native shore. \" Didst ever think, Mr. James, one might find a carcanet or a ring, or a purse of broad pieces, washed up"], [72, "60 Days of Yore. by this greedy foam ?\" suggested Mistress Peggy, peering down at the tide. Mr. James was bound to say he had found her dreams too mercenary already, so he behoved to solemnise them by substituting an opposite vision. \" Rather the brain less skull or the bony hand of one of its thousands of skeletons.\" \" Preserve us ! I wouldna wish to find it,\" responded Mistress Peggy, with a shudder ; \" though, poor human WTeck ! it wouldna take a bite of me,\" she added, recover ing herself promptly. At the same time it was clear that she had more heart to confront a living Spaniard with her blunderbuss, than his bleached bones, unarmed save by her faith. \"What heaps and heaps of them there maun be down there, Mr. James. I cannot help whiles thinking that Captain Joshua may be added to them, in place of lying beside the Hays, the Learmonts, the Areskines, the Lumsdeans, and the Melvilles, in our ain kirkyard.\" \" He is in the Lord's hand, my dear Mistress Peggy,\" remarked Mr. James, gently; and she bent her head gratefully and reverently. \" We'll have an oncome soon, Mistress Peggy,\" said Mr. James, after a pause, I feel it already, it is too late in the season for thunder, it will be a drenching mist and a tearing gale. Thank God the fishing is over.

Mr. James excused himself on the ground that John Melville's spouse had his' plate set. He was nothing loth to terminate the promenade, and be restored to his vanishing rhymes. But the couple parted very cordially at the entrance of the street, to which Mr. James had courteously returned with his old damsel \u2014 Mistress Peggy murmuring to herself \" James Melville, you're the beggar's brother for all your wit and lear ; but it's not that that will render you the least in the kingdom of heaven ;\" and Melville reflecting, \" I did not deserve your blows, Mis tress Peggy, but they were not very sore, seeing they"], [74, "62 Days of Yore. were dealt by no malicious hand. My would-be-worldly old lady, I'll have more space for thee at Anster, and if I do not bring thee round to my notions, I'll at least con vince thee that I've a fondness for thy wrinkles, above most lines of beauty. I can dote on thy service to thy neighbour, and thy anxiety about young Eppie, and thy tenderness to meek little Captain Joshua \u2014 whom thou wouldst rear into a Samson or a Goliath, while nature cast him and me, in stature, no bigger than Zaccheuses \u2014 more than on a world of airs and graces, compliments and con descensions.\" H, \u2014 the storm and its unexpected consequences. James Melville was right in his prognostications. A gale was rising, such as frequently swept the coast, and strewed it with wrecks. It roared among the old chim neys of Mistress Peggy's house, and up and down her wide staircases and passages ; it hissed in its rapid accu mulation of spray on the thick, small-lozenged window panes, and whistled angrily in at the shaking wooden framework. It is possible that Mistress Peggy affected not to hear it, since she astounded young Eppie by denominating it a chance puff of air, when she com plained of the soot descending in the midst of her pastry. The pilots, retired captains, and idle sailors, were already lounging down to the pier, with heads inclined scien tifically so as to balance bonnet or cap on shaggy hair without support \u2014 a performance which no land-lubber"], [75, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 63 accustomed to faint zephyr stealing round the lee of a solid hill, could hope to emulate. But Mistress Peggy would not admit the fact of a storm, until James Melville rode by unflinchingly through the gathering blast he had anti cipated, to his manse in the Tolbooth Wynd of Anstru ther. \" That wilful lad,\" she said, \" he'll be wet to the skin, or slung from the saddle.\" \" Madam,\" spoke Captain Robert, consolingly, \" I've walked the quarter-deck in a stiffer wind, and had the spray on every side, and ne'er been a grain the worse for the airing and the ducking.\" \"And though you had been as ill as you could be, Captain Robert,\", said Mistress Peggy, rather pettishly, \" that would have been a sma' matter to James Melville's being in the least degree mazed, or chilled, or spent in an autumn tempest.\" \" I believe it,\" averred the big, brown, young man, with some earnestness; \"a sea-calf is not to be compared to a lion ; but I'll away to the harbour-head, where I can be of use in my own calling.\" And with a gusty sigh, heard even above the tempest, and certainly directed in no way to Mistress Peggy, he quitted the apartment. This Captain Robert, or Robin Scrymgeour, was only a young man of about five-and-twenty, but by exposure and hard work on the sea, he looked as though middle aged. He was a square, sunburnt, imperative man. Loud, unceremonious, and peremptory, as his profession disposed him to be, he was an autocrat on deck ; still he was decidedly soft in one region of the heart, and shy and sensitive, as well as ardent. Poor Captain Robert"], [76, "Days of Yore. 64 had the disadvantage of possessing a case which did not well correspond with his inner works. It was difficult to conceive the big, brusque, unconsciously noisy man as ever being bashful, tender, and touching. No one could look in his broad, frank, fearless face, or answer his unhesitating, hearty hail, without feeling that he was a worthy man, and one probably endowed with both bodily and mental health and activity ; but one would never have thought of associating delicacy and fancy with him more than with an elephant. Now Captain Robert, though he had never even named the qualities to himself or to the rest of the world, had some delicacy and fancy ; and one proof of this was that he felt keenly, at present, his own surface defects, and began, thus late in the day, to regret bitterly his rough and old-looking exterior. \" She'll have nought to say to a man who looks like a widower of forty ; and what grace can I command, to approach her with smiles, and bows, and soft words, when my cheek is as dark as mahogany, and my very beard is more bushy than Captain Joshua's, and my lightest footfall shakes the room, and all my sentences form themselves into orders and commands ?\" It was all the worse for Captain Robert that young Eppie Melville was acting in perfect sincerity and ingenuousness, while their mutual relatives and friends would have had the banns published off-hand between the man and woman as an exceedingly fit pair, since they were both members of the righteous kirk, and the one a Scrymgeour, the other a Melville. Unfortuna&Jy, young Eppie was not of this mind, as"], [77, "Peggv Melville's Triumph. 65 she sat on the bunker or window-seat of her aunt's par lour at Crail, darning \u2014 a very necessary operation for which ladies of every age must then have occasionally intermitted their wheels, distaffs, aad spindles, prick-song and embroider}', while the windy weather prevailed. Young Eppie was a beautified edition of Mistress Peggy; looking at the one, you could revive the young life of the other. Eppie, too, was big and large-featured, but so sonsy (Anglice plump) and so fair that there was nothing unwomanly in her size. How could there be? When were there ever such peach-like cheeks ? There was positively a pearly bloom on them, like the impal pable soft mealiness on the grape and the plum. In this same fairness there was a youthfulness that only faded when the tender rose grew into the streaked red which yet kindled Mistress Peggy's high cheek bones. Perhaps there would have been a babiness about that pure, creamy bloom, had it not been for the decided features, and their decided expression. Still Eppie was no queen, any more than Captain Robert was an ogre. But in spite of her bulk, she had a pleasant liveliness, even amid the gravity of a Scotch presbyterian household. She had a foot as light as ever danced a saraband, if the General Assembly and Mis tress Peggy would have allowed profane dancing ; and an arch humour, too, though she had been bred in an atmosphere of sermons, and had a liking for them, as a good, unsophisticated girl likes what she imagines is wholesome and profitable, even when she cannot always rise to its presumed earnestness. A constant association F"], [78, "66 Days of Yore. with these had melted and lightened whatever was hard, stern, dry, and dark at a distance, and shaped them into the familiar habits of a reasonably happy young life ; run .hem into the trained channels and guided currents of drought and feeling, of a simple, intelligent, and sensible mind. Eppie was open and affectionate, but wilful, and a little mischievous within bounds. It was true that from the years that she had tottered at her aunt's foot she had been reared to meditate and confer kindness ; to think not for herself alone, but for others ; and to aim, however weakly, at justice, mercy, and holiness. But for all that, she was a little wilful, and had a small store of repressed fun ; and, to complete her character, she was rather ignorant of human nature and her own capacity, and tolerably blinded to Captain Robert's real merits, and what she might gain or lose in him. This was a pity, but it was not a marvel. Eppie was not Captain Joshua's daughter; she was the child of another brother of Mistress Peggy's \u2014 a brother the old lady had contended with all his violent life, and nursed fondly on his quiet death-bed. The girl was thus completely an orphan, and entirely under Mistress Peggy's tutelage ; but she paid her maiden aunt a higher compli ment than to allow her to make her miserable. So she was undignified enough to peep slyly after Captain Robert, as he went out, for the purpose of saying satirically, quite low to herself\u2014\" He rolls like a grampus. Now ! what would I do with a brown sea captain ? I've enough ado to keep myself cheery and"], [79, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 67 perform my duty, without plaguing myself with sic a terrific burden. If I'm ever to have a man of my ain, he maun be gracious and learned like our Master James, or at least, easy and pleasant like that sorry young Learmont. Why should the sinners always win the ball for pleasant ness? The Apostle bids us be courteous, and is aye minding us to rejoice, but we're ower stark and ower dowff to heed his injunctions. I'll wait till I meet a gude man, and a soft-tongued, young, brisk, and bonny ane like mysel', an' such as Mistress Peggy hersel' sometimes thinks there's no ill in singing about. But let them say or do what they will, our ballants will go on hand in hand with our psalms ; they are often doleful enough to be clean out of the category of light sangs. I'll not ballast myself with a great, roaring sea-captain.\" The gale rose with the night tide and blew in those trumpet blasts and sudden fierce roars that presage the wildest of coast storms. The sea raised its voice, and all Crail echoed with the tumult of earth and sky, until by the early morning few lay abed, but hurried up and out to learn what damage had been done, but principally to look on the tossed, tormented sea, all bare, save where some poor vessel, with naked poles, scudded on the crests ot the seething waves, fretted already with sad tokens, and bringing in a harvest the most mournful that human avarice can claim. There was reason enough that Crail should be astir this October morning. One ship had been laid on the Car Rock, and then lifted up and driven in upon the town, and was now being beaten to fragments ; and F 2"], [80, "Days of Yore. 68 another was still holding off, and making for Anstruther, round the breakers off the point. Captain Robert had been aroused, by break of day, to lend his skill and strength. Even Mistress Peggy, though this was the very day she was to travel to Anstruther to await her beloved brother Captain Joshua, donned her hood, and hurried with her niece, and the whole population of Crail \u2014 man, woman, and child \u2014 to witness the disaster and its end. Had the wind not begun to lull, this would have been impossible for the weaker portion of the community ; but being possible, they availed themselves of it instantly. It is to be feared they had an appetite for wrecks, even the most disinterested and righteous of them. Wrecks were their spectacles, their crop of romance, excitement and passion, and they awoke such instincts and emotions as the old tournaments and bear fights had not reached. Men looked on the peril and read a new page of life ; women came, wept, trembled, prayed, and underwent what was dimly akin to a second birth ; boys gazed and gazed, ran in among their elders and eagerly read their looks, words and acts, and were first faintly conscious of the troubled depths of their future manhood. When, as in this instance, the ship was strange to them, they could enter into the drama and perform their part in it without the distraction of personal care, or the distress of neigh bourly concern. If Mistress Peggy, on the earliest announcement of the accident, had any sickening mis givings pointing to the \"Lord Henry\" and Captain Joshua, they were soon dispersed by ocular demonstra tion ; and if they lingered with the old lady in contem-"], [81, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 69 plating the fury of the storm, and sharpened her interest in those exposed to its worst, she said nothing of her private doubts and fears. In truth, notwithstanding her spirit and strength, it required all Mistress Peggy's breath to supply her lungs as she stood in the place of honour on the shore, respectfully backed by two of the principal men in Crail \u2014 the innkeeper and the mercer \u2014 with the minister, Mr. John Melville, at one elbow, and Eppie Melville fluttering at the other. An east coast gale must be the likest to a hurricane of anything in Britain. Few would believe the extent of its power if they had not fought it, or been foiled by it in pitched battle. The storm spends itself for the principal hours of its duration in prolonged gusts that rush with the concentra tion of a blast in a Highland gorge, and actually oppose a solid violence to the toiling wayfarer. This incensed, unappeasable opponent, is further strengthened by the wrack with which it is laden, and which can be plainly seen by the eye \u2014 a stream or reversed pillar of vapour approaching to engulph the traveller, the nearest to a water spout or the sandy whirlwind of the desert of all the wide phenomena of nature. This wrack divides at its edge into the minutest dust of rain, which, mingling with the lashed spray, and the shifting sand, and the flecks of foam, renders the air dense, and enwraps the whole wild stage of the seashore where the breakers are thundering, and where the central figure of a ship is stretched in sad motionlessness, or only quivers now and then from stem to stern, until at length one mightier sea-"], [82, "Days of Yore. 70 wolf than the rest springs on its side, and rebounds again howling. The ship, though unknown, was not of foreign build, yet the seamen swore she was manned by foreigners, as they neither comprehended nor answered signals. Her crew was very numerous for her size, too; for they clustered like bees fore and aft, while she was fixed on the shore, and the waves shook and twisted and ground her rib from rib. Had she not swung inland head fore most, with an impetus that launched her far in-shore, and had the tide not been low, she would have been under water long before a man could come out of Crail to her aid. As it was, the tide was rising, and her danger was every moment on the increase. At the mention of foreigners, there had been a signifi cant glance and pause, and the fatal word Armada trembled on several tongues. But Captain Robert sum moned the best men to follow him, and the appeal stirred other feelings in them. No boat could live down there ; for the great sea billows, broken by the cruel rock, where the spray fell again like a linn, did not so much advance rank by rank, as bubbled and raged, and lashed each other like demons. But there was a hope of shooting a rope through the surf, and by that narrow causeway landing the drowning crew. For this purpose picked men advanced as far as possible into the water, and endeavoured to cast the line where it could be caught by those on board the vessel. This is not so dangerous a service as the attempt to rescue by a boat, but it is sufficiently hazardous, and"], [83, "Peggy Melvilles Triumph. 71 very striking in its features to the anxious eyes of the spectators. Five or six men formed a chain, and waded hand in hand into the turmoil. Their progress was sickeningly slow; and they stood and yielded at intervals, while wind and water, as if infuriated by their courage and coolness, whirled and spouted against them with fresh violence. Homely, curt, careless fellows, they think nothing of their deed, even when they feel their feet slipping from beneath them ; and they have seen, ere now, some of their number hurried off as in a chariot. One man breaks the slender chain, and advances alone. He is chief in muscle and nerve, or he has the responsi bility of command. If that swaying line, which shows like a thread against the roused elements, is fixed, what will hinder it even then from snapping \u2014 exposed to so fearful a strain ? And if it snaps, away go the men who are paying it out and those who are clinging to it as to salvation. Captain Robert was the man who cast the rope to the ship on the shore at Crail, and well for him that his stature was full, his sturdy vigour established, and his presence of mind and authority acquired. He stood singly in advance ; he made the throws, under which even his balance wavered, and he caught again the rope when it fell wide of the mark. The spray went over and over him, and round and round him, and whether it blinded him or no, it blinded the spectators. Once it dragged him down, and he swam for a minute and a half till he regained his depth. No Hercules could have struck out five minutes in that whirlpool. Once again"], [84, "Days of Yore. 72 he was dragged down, and an eager shout arose, \" Come back, Captain Robert, you're ower venturesome ; you'll be swamped as sure as you're alive.\" The whole crowd held their breath for him, counted his feats, and blessed his gallantry. Mistress Peggy did not turn away, she gazed stead fastly, and murmured through her shrivelled lips, \" Robin, Robin Scrymgeour, you're playing the man this day.\" She envied him. When he succeeded in his aim, and a great shout on shore joined the faint cheer of the seamen on board, Mr. John Melville, the minister of Crail, who was holding converse with the infirmity and timorousness of age, bared his white head to the blast, and uttered aloud a thanksgiving and a petition for further protection, and the people joined silently in his prayer with a hush of reverent faith, and glistening, grateful eyes. Poor young Eppie's feelings were roused to the utmost pitch. At first she had plucked her aunt energetically by the gown, and sobbed out, white and scared \u2014 \" Let me gang hame, auntie, I canna stand to see it.\" \" Stay where you are, bairn,\" Mistress Peggy answered, emphatically, \" and learn the vanity of life.\" \" But, auntie,\" groaned Eppie again in a few moments, forced by the torture she was undergoing to be explicit, \" I cannot bide it, since \u2014 since Captain Robert is the foremost man. You ken, you ken I've no right to watch him, clasp my hands and set my teeth till he come back \u2014 though I never meant to abuse him, and it was not my wyte, you ken, auntie ; I dare not witness his danger, or his destruction.\""], [85, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 73 \" I command you not to lift a foot, Eppie Melville ; if you stir from my side, I'll send some of the menfolk after you. It serves you weel, you vain lass, and you shall see what stuff gude Robin Scrymgeour's made of before he is done with you, as he ought to have been lang syne.\" So Eppie had no resource left her but to stand and look. Soon eager curiosity and tremulous interest robbed her of the cowardly impulse to escape the contem plation of his triumph ; for now Captain Robert triumphed over every detractor. Who could call to mind his rough ness and loudness, and heavy-set manhood, while he stood there with his life in his hand for the sake of his neighbour ? Who could waste a thought on the absence of lightness and elegance, in the immediate presence of the stern realities of life and death ? But Eppie remembered distinctly her own objections to Captain Robert on these counts \u2014 her own flouts at his awkwardness and unwieldiness. She remembered how she had clouded his clear eyes with reproach by running away from his company to the psalm sing ing, and had dulled his best narrative by her indiffer ence when he spun his yarns to her Auntie Peggy and Mr. John Melville over the lamp, by the hearth or at supper. And he had never blamed her; but had laboured to make himself less loud and gruff, if not less big and brown. He had attended to her whims, and courted her with every conceivable gift from his stores. But she scorned to be propitiated by them, and would even have returned them if she could have dared. He"], [86, "Days of Yore. 74 was her kinsman, however, and Mistress Peggy was in the way, and she had no choice but to receive, and then disparage and neglect them. He had forgotten her now, as he stood there swinging and rocking as he had never swung and rocked in his hammock ; he had, for the moment, forgotten his mistress, and the pain she had cost him, and would have been impatient to be reminded of her, as men turn from women in their peculiar combats. Yes, he loved her, he knew that too well ; but he was a man, and must do his duty ; she should not come between him and it. It would be hard, if after embittering all else, she should thwart him here. But there was no cause why Eppie should forget ; and she remembered all, and with notable results. First, she prayed with all her heart to the merciful God not to punish her lightness and foolishness, by slaying her cousin, Captain Robert, in his nobleness before her eyes. Then she said to herself, that she had not known Captain Robert in his bravery and gallantry, and she had not dreamt how proud she should be of his deeds. She would listen to no other suitor, wed no likelier man. How could she give the preference to a glib tongue, a smooth courtesy, a red and white cheek like her own, when she had seen Captain Robert thus faithfully risk his life for strangers. The heroic vision would rise and humble her in all ordinary circumstances. Oh ! she wished Captain Robert could receive her resolutions and her vow. Thirdly \u2014 and this was when Captain Robert swam that minute and a half, buffeting those water-mountains"], [87, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 75 \u2014 Eppie suddenly struck her colours and laid down her arms. In her desperation she vowed, unheard by any mortal it is true, but it was registered in her own soul and conscience : \"I will wed you, Captain Robert; I'll never say you nay again, man ; I'll go before the minister to-morrow, if you'll but come back to dry land.\" It is the privilege of honest, upright, godly men and women that, however they may swerve or waver on occa sions, their inclinations, in place of mastering their faith, become its hand-maidens when it is once fairly roused and called into action. Was it impossible young Peggy should be thus conquered? No more than many a generous man, looking on a poor woman who has passed through a fight of afflictions, longs for that reason to make her his own. The fact was, the moment Eppie took that magnani mous resolution, her cheeks began to burn less painfully, and her heart to throb less overpoweringly. She could exert her eyes and ears again ; indeed her sight and hearing seemed to have been magically touched by some precious ointment, as when Cinderella underwent the touch of the fairy's kind wand. Captain Robert, among the waves, looked grand and goodly, a man for a silly woman to be proud of and to cherish upon her knees. His face, when he turned for a second, was as dauntless and as true a face as could give comfort and protection to a weak woman ; and his voice when he shouted his orders, was as sweet in its persistence, as it was manly in its power. But the chance of withdrawing her protest, and allow-"], [88, "76 Days of Yore. ing her consent, was not swift to come. There was Captain Robert still straining every nerve, and perilling his valuable life to relieve his fellow-creatures, in perfect ignorance of her intention. She felt it would be so hard if he should never learn it, so dreadful if, his delusion unbroken, he should fall a sacrifice. And she felt that now she was bound to interfere, when for the third or fourth time he traversed the rope with his pas sengers. They were so slow, those stupid, staggered, slight-built strangers. With dilating, beseeching eyes, she appealed for the last time to her aunt : \" Must he continue to go ? Is he to be worn out ? Will no person take Captain Robert's place, or is he to get his death of cold, if he be not clutched by some drowning man, or swallowed up by the hindmost wave ?\" Mistress Peggy shook her off afresh, though this time more gently : \"Whisht ! ye silly bairn, Captain Robert is the captain, and that tow is his vessel \u2014 a captain never quits the ship till every living soul is delivered. I, mysel', would not suner leave my house in the circumstances.\" Young Eppie could have stamped with impatience, and then cried with contrition and fear. But at length the weary task was ended ; Captain Robert escorted his last half-helpless charge over his gangway, and staggered on shore himself. The Crail men raised some plaudits for their captain, since the step between them and eternity had again widened out to a lifetime. But then came cold glances and rising murmurs against the rescued crew \u2014 a swarm of dark-haired, sallow-faced men, with oddly cut jerkins, high hats, and long beards. Out of the jaws"], [89, "Peggy Melville s Triumph. 77 of the great deep, they were hovering on the brink of another danger. What business had such as they near the coast, when men were looking for the Armada ? The Armada ! the word was a test ; stop them ! pinion them ! gag them ! apply to them their own tortures. Think of the cursed Inquisition, and the peaceful British subjects \u2014 the faithful Protestants \u2014 burnt at the stake like savage Red Indians. The shipwreck on the Car Rock was perhaps a feint of the Spaniard, the pope, and the devil, to procure a landing ! Rather set on them and dispatch them where they stood, before they had time to recover their cunning and their doggedness, than tamper with invasion. But Captain Robert interfered and allayed the sudden panic. Soaked and draggled from head to foot, and thoroughly chilled and exhausted, he gasped out, bluntly and overbearingly, that it was his affair, that these men were in his keeping, and that he was inclined to consult Mr. James Melville and my Lord Kelly on their disposal. He had communicated with their captain, and, in the meantime, he should lodge them, and command them to be refreshed. When some opposition presented itself to his orders, Captain Robert, notwithstanding his long bath, waxed warm, touched his own sword, indicated that only two or three of the strangers were armed, and finally banned the burghers for base cowardly loons, if they dared to contradict his orders, or interfere with his pre rogative. He could hardly be said to reason, but then he hectored like a brave man who had played his part, and like an unsophisticated man who never doubted his"], [90, "78 Days of Yore. right to dictate terms. The stiff, pugnacious townsmen looked glum, and muttered a little, but they bent to the claims of gentle birth, the influence of the Melvilles, and the deeds of Captain Robert. The waifs he had rescued were stowed away safely enough, both as regarded them selves and the townspeople, for they were locked into the empty church, which the zealous mob had stripped, and in which they were yet to sign the Covenant amidst tears and prayers, and the most solemn oaths ever nation swore. III. \u2014 THE HERO'S REWARD. Captain Roeert in his beaver, and with dry hose and doublet, prepared to start for Anstruther. \" Tush ! it's a daft emergence,\" he protested, not caring to be praised, and certainly a little spent with his efforts, though he would hardly own it. He was perfectly unconscious of the change of fortune that was awaiting him. This was no time to approach him with overtures, and Eppie grew frightened and anxious. It was a comfort that they were to travel in company, for no fatigue or stress of weather would induce Mistress Peggy to fail in her appointment, when Captain Joshua was expected in port. Even on that howling, tempestuous day, roads were open, and sure footed East Neuk beasts paced them, and hardy East Neuk folks journeyed to their destination. It was a simple cavalcade. Mistress Peggy, in her hat and mantle, sat on a pillion behind one of her old, stolid, sure Carnbee men, on a work-day horse. She travelled"], [91, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 79 so seldom now-a-days, that she indulged in no palfrey. Eppie rode on her own brisk pony, which she managed per fectly, and Captain Robert, who, being a cadet of family, rode indifferently well for a sailor, was mounted on a fresh horse, hired from the Arskine Arms, of size to suit his own proportions. He towered above his companions, and though he was in such good company, seemed, shame upon him ! eager for the road, and perplexed and abstracted, rather than attentive and painstaking, as had been his wont. Eppie did not know what to make of him, and it appeared to grow more and more difficult to proffer to him a hint of her soft relenting. She was nervous, she was not herself; yet she was more fasci nating in her soul-breathing heats and tremours, than in the undimmed, unmoved lustre of her fairness and state liness. But that horrid, brown sea-captain, only made to strive for drowning men, or stamp up and down on deck, or blurt out his truthfulness, and blush, got no benefit by this \" lovely woman's agitation.\" In his old white Manse, in the Tolbooth Wynd of Anstruther, James Melville, through the sough and shriek of the wind and the dash of the waves, dreamt of his captive Kirk, the lady of his vision, and slept away the fatigues of his daily duties. His surroundings were not very congenial. His lodging was penned into a narrow space, and so imprisoned by stone and lime, that even the fresh breeze of the free, restless sea, and the redeem ing glory of the bleak coast view were denied. The poet's heart must have longingly anticipated the steep roofed country house in the wide garden, with the far"], [92, "Days of Yore. 80 view over the harbour with its shipping, and the shining sea \u2014 the beloved retreat of the watch-tower, which he had then dimly planned, which he afterwards built, and which, after he had dwelt in its chambers for many years, and stamped and embalmed it with associations of his public and private life, he renounced when his step was lagging slow, and his soft hair was wasted from his temples, though he was still, as he said, \" not old, but elderly.\" But he was not dependent on circumstances, and he was yet far removed from the time when he bowed his erect head in sickness and despondency. To James Melville the commonplace was not common, but had its own quiet, hidden, still beauty, more refreshing in its shade than effulgence, and more delicate in its unobtru siveness than the picturesque. At this moment he was rather rudely roused from his slumbers by the startling announcement that the Baillies of Anster waited to have speech of him anent a matter of mighty importance to the burgh. \" Ah, James, it is the Spaniard at last !\" cries Elizabeth, sitting up in her pure night-dress, not forgetting even at that moment to put out her hand to rock the cumbrous cradle with the ever-wakeful baby. \" The Lord's will be done!\" she sighed, and only added, \" Sir, where would you have me dispose of the bairns ?\" for she never dreamt of cumbering, far less of controlling her husband. \" The stranger's room maun be your stronghold, Lizzie, because it looks to the back. Hold ! there is the milk house, with only a boll of a window to admit the shot."], [93, "Peggy Melville s Triumph. 81 Lock yourself in there, my woman, when you hear the din ; the bairns, poor things, will be pacified with a soup of the cream, and I'll come to you, my dear, as soon as I can.\" \" You'll not waste yourself upon me, James Melville,\" quavered the faithful woman ; \" I'll have licht to read a verse, and I'll pray.\" \" Ay, pray Lizzie, in your closet, and I'll pray in the stour of the streets ; and our cry will go up through the strife of men into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.\" \" But, minister,\" urged a disturbed voice at the door, \" the Armada has come to us in a strange pickle. This is a shipload of distressed men, whose vessel foundered off the Fair Isle in the Orkneys, and who obtained a bark and came here, not to carry fire and sword, but to crave mercy to save them from perishing of hardship and want.\" \" Now our Lord hath delivered the Amalekites blind fold and bound into our hands,\" cried James Melville, \" that we might slay and spare not. Agag never went more delicately than their Philip. Expound unto each of them this text, my brethren \u2014 ' As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women.' \" I do not mean to represent James Melville as faultless. By no means. He was of those ministers of the Kirk of Scotland to whose fervent spirits the clear, stern legisla tion of Geneva, with its virtues and its errors, came home as being akin to their own grave, earnest natures. To their minds they had received \" the belt of correction\" G"], [94, "82 Days of Yore. and the keys of the Church. Of some of them it could be written, \" The gown nae sooner off, and the Bible out of hands frae the kirk, when on gaed the corselet, and fangit was the hacquebut, and to the field.\" These words, spoken by Regent Morton, have their meaning : \u2014 \"There will never be quietness in the country till half a dozen of you be hanged or banished the country.\" To whom Andrew Melville answered, \" Tush, sir, it is the same to me whether I rot in the air or in the ground. The earth is the Lord's. * * * * It will not be in your power to hang or exile His truth.\" These men had scattered the hives and freed them selves from the shaveling monks and friars by main force, which had its cost, as yonder ancient St. Andrew's and its piles could tell ; they were threatened with a reaction which, to their excited consciences, was the fatal looking back that would blast their redemption. The tender souls among all classes were now like James Melville pausing to hide the thoughtless boys and girls \" playing in the streets,\" and the sucking child at the mother's breast, from the murderous Spaniard. Did you expect them to be upon ceremony, or to testify perfect meek ness ? James Melville, notwithstanding his hereditary ardour and intrepidity, was reckoned patient, considerate, and peculiarly benevolent. On this account he was regularly chosen as moderator, president, and truce bearer in the encounters of his generation. But even James Melville did not belie his name, or fail to exhibit that vehemence which, however tempered and chastened, ran hot in his blood as in the rash veins of Mr. Andrew,"], [95, "Peggy As civil le's Triumph. 83 who yet scorned to retain the recollection of personal injury, and freely forgave and generously solaced his bitterest foes. The baillie's homely features blazed for a moment with the evil light kindled in James Melville's face, then the glow relaxed, and his honest lip trembled with uncertainty \u2014 \" The commanders had landed bare-headed and with sheathed swords. AVe ordered them to their ships again. They humbly obeyed, and, Mr. James, their fellows are for the most part young, beardless men \u2014 silly, trauchled, and hungered.\" \" Silly, trauchled, and hungered ! \u2014 the ravishers and idolatrous foreign invaders ! Was this their invincibility?\" Yea, but it was invincibility. James Melville stared blankly, his eyes fell, his stout heart smote him pain fully. He bade his friend convene the responsible men of the town in the Tolbooth close by his door, and hurried to join them. There, amongst curious, doubtful, lrowning looks, was that very reverent man of big stature and great grace, and grey-haired, ay, grey-headed enough to have been James Melville's father. Unless James Melville had started back and prevented him, he would in his low obeisance, which yet was not without a certain dignity and loftiness, have touched the minister's feet as well as the ground with his bearded lip. Then began that most stately and sorrowful harangue, spoken in Spanish, to James Melville by this Jan Gomez de Medina, general of twenty hulks, his jewelled orders on his breast, the medallion of his ruthless, ambitious king round his neck. G 2"], [96, "Days of Yore. 84 Long before he attempted to answer in Latin the old man's speech, Melville's heart had melted like water. Thus James Melville's preamble was short. He explained with his frankness and sincerity, \" that their friendship would not be very great, seeing that the Spaniards and their king were friends to the greatest enemy of Christ \u2014 the Pope of Rome ; while we with our king defend not him, nor yet his cause, but were against it.\" But there was all fulness of mercy and toleration in his conclusion. \" Nevertheless,\" he said, \" you shall find by experience that we are men, and so moved by human compassion. For whereas our people resorting among the Spaniards in peaceable manner, and for lawful affairs of merchandise, were taken, cast into prison, their goods and gear con fiscated, and their bodies committed to the fire for the cause of religion, they should find nothing here but Christianity and works of mercy, and always leaving to God to work in their hearts concerning religion, as it pleased Him.\" For this noble reply Don Jan Gomez gave thanks, and said, no doubt justly, that he could not answer for their kirk, and the laws and orders of it, but only for himself; that there were divers Scotsmen who knew him, and to whom he had shown courtesy and favour at Cadiz, and he supposed some of this same town of Anstruther. The baillies granted license to the commander and his captains to obtain refreshment, and they departed in contentment till the overlord of Anstruther and the neighbouring gentry were advertised of the marvel. A throng was round Mr. James \u2014 a throng of agitated"], [97, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 85 men, with whom, in place of urging the example of Samuel and Agag, he pled in the words of the prophet Elisha to the king of Israel, when the blinded Syrians opened their eyes in Samaria : \" Thou shalt not smite them ; \" \" Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master ;\" \"And he prepared great provision for them.\" In the midst of Mr. James's lecture, which these worthy men of Anster interpreted readily, Captain Robert knocked with his riding-whip at the Tolbooth door, and Mistress Peggy's riding-skirt fluttered down the street. Mr. James shrugged his shoulders \u2014 \" I must be able to impress my relentings at my ain hearth, else Mistress Peggy will play my Lady Makgill of Rankeillour, and I will be forced to banish her belyve out of my hearing.\" But Captain Robert also told his tale, and to his great relief Mr. James wrung his hand in token of the utmost sympathy \u2014 \" You have done well, sir, you have excelled. I envy you that you were sent to deliver them. I have no fear of my kinswoman since she has cast een on their grievous plight, and trembled for their near destruction, Aha ! Mistress Peggy, there is no word of the blunder buss now, but of roaring fires and warm duds and cordia! drinks to heap on the head of the foe.\" Mistress Peggy was ready at his call. \" Mr. James, I would scorn to strike a fallen man. Poor lads, pool lads ! they are far frae their mothers and sisters ; drown ing the ae moment, in durance the next, and it's a lang word to hame. Eppie, bestir yoursel', ye selfish lass; what can we do to comfort these forlorn and desolate men?\""], [98, "86 Days of Yore. Mr. James chose for that evening's homily \u2014 not the blessed text : \" If thine enemy hunger, feed him,\" for that would have seemed to savour of the self-commenda tion which \" in privity\" his soul abhorred \u2014 but the conscience-stricken address of David to Abigail: \" Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me.\" \" Blessed be thou which has kept me from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.\" Ere evening, there was a grand gathering in Anstruther. The arrivals were such as caused Mistress Peggy and her niece, and even shy Mrs. Melville to put themselves in proper apparel, shake out their wimples and their standing collars, fasten the jewelled drops to the band above the brow, and the ouches on their girdle. Yet, it is true, young Eppie's gaze was wondrously distraught and dim from a window in the principal street, where they could enjoy the rare sight of so many old friends, and the general show of horse and rider, groom and hound, as they defiled to the grim Tolbooth door. Some merry young lads were following the captain, mimicking his formal seat in the saddle, and eagerly coveting his early renown. By a peculiar coincidence the two boys who were capering most lightly and jauntily were the lineal descendants of Thomas Learmont of Ercildown, and Michael Scott of Balwearie. There, too, was the green sprout of Sir David Balfour, another lord of session, from Randerstone, hard by the sea, and there was a representative of the Monypennys of Pitmilly, by Pitmilly Burn, proverbial for producing statesmen of"], [99, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 87 distinction both at home and in France. There flourished a Cunningham of the Cunninghams of Kilmaurs, Earls of Glencairn, from the bam-like house of the Barnes, to whom belonged the pleasant but profitless Isle of May ; and a Sandilands from the Castle of St. Monans or Newark, set upon a solid rock in the sea \u2014 this Sandi lands, yet to be created Lord Abercromby, was bred of the house of Torphichen, of whom you read in the life of John Knox. Mistress Peggy looked, admired, and nodded her head, with its ponderous pile, which rose like a bee-hive in the centre, with fans at each side. \"A pretty sight! It minds me of what my mother was wont to tell of the grand gala day when Queen Mary, our luckless Mary's mother, landed at Balcomie Point, and every laird and lady of the East Neuk rode in her train to St. Andrew's to meet my lord the king.\" Mistress Peggy did not care to mention another pro cession she had beheld. This October gathering did not remind her (how could it ?) of that rush of white-faced, silent or deep-voiced men and women, whose agony and rage of sympathy did not prevent them hurrying to St. Andrew's to see Mr. George Wishart seal his creed, and Cardinal Beatoun receive the document. Yet the old lady remembered it \u2014 how she remembered it ! It had been the climax and turning-point to a life then young, and almost gorgeous in its bloom. But the autumn afternoon was drawing to an end. The gentlemen about Anstruther having dined at noon and finished their sitting, were thinking of riding cannily"], [100, "88 Days of Yore. home again, or dropping aside into little convivial parties, to eat their supper, and, it is to be feared, depart from the straight road of sobriety, by entering upon those orgies which King Jamie himself, highly decorous in other respects, always countenanced, and which neither Knox nor Melville, for all their wise kindly moderation in meat and drink, could quell. These Fife gentlemen were nevertheless brave men and honourable, and could not disgrace themselves by a dastardly revenge. They rather experienced a merciful or a supercilious satisfaction in extending charity to this strange and stray debarkation of the Armada. So my lord of Anstruther carried off Don Jan Gomez de Medina to taste his high hospitality, and half-a-dozen more gregarious lairds trotted home in the gale to consult their puzzled dames, and make arrangements for similar receptions. But the main body were stowed in the Tolbooth, which had just been used as a council-chamber, and somewhat like wild beasts did the dark-eyed, long haired, southern-tongued strangers appear, peeped at as they were, half-curiously, half in scorn, by the townsfolk. Eppie Melville amongst the rest, would see the strangers. So Captain Robert took the girl a little discontentedly, for he said to himself with irritable jealousy: \"Now, I would not wonder, though my lass were taken with a craze for these wrecked prisoners \u2014 women aye side with the weak and vanquished, and the more wizened and ill-conditioned they are, perhaps the women are all the readier to be smitten. But she maun have her way.\""], [101, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 89 Eppie walked round the dismal guard-room, and glanced shyly at the olive-skins, the lustrous eyes, the slender limbs, and the emphatic gestures, and picked out the chief men, as much by their proud look and endurance and composure as by their scarfs and rings. And the gallant Spaniards gazed in their turn, and were charmed at the tall fair beauty, so statue-like, but rose tinged as if the setting sun had shot its last rays on the snow of her cheeks, perhaps fancying at the same time with what a noble motion she would tread in their dances, how her long firm fingers would swing and crack the castanets. \" They are comely youths, though they be black and slim, Captain Robert,\" whispered Eppie. Captain Robert groaned and shouldered his bulk. \" They are new-fangled, Eppie,\" he muttered, scornfully. \" I'm wae for them, Captain Robert.\" \"Lass,\" said the captain, \"you need not tell me that.\" \"And I would like to solace them.\" \" Eppie, you had better try it. I have borne many a thing, but this I will not stand. I was willing to ware my life for the like of them, papists and heathens as they are, not six hours syne ; but I fear they had better have gone to the bottom after all !\" To Captain Robert's utter amazement and discomfiture Eppie now began to cry. She had expected this turn, and led the way to it. \" I wonder at you, Captain Robert. You saved these poor souls, and you are a grand man, and they but beardless boys ; but you should not grudge them a woman's pity.\""], [102, "Days of Yore. 90 \" Now, now, forgive me, Eppie, I would not hurt you ; but ah ! woman, you flung away on these strangers of an hour what you never yielded neither to my service or to my prayers.\" \"It is not true,\" sobbed Eppie, passionately; \"though I laughed, I was vexed at your courtship. I tried to stop it to save you pain, and every now and then I was blaming myself hardly that I should cause you to suffer, until \u2014 only \u2014 until this morning.\" \" God forgive you, Eppie ; what was there in a simple act of duty that could rob me of your scant esteem?\" \" Oh ! Captain Robert, dinna you see that from the moment I saw you performing your duty you had no need of my pity?\" He did not see it ; he had some thought that she was mocking him. \"Would you prefer my pity to my admiration?\" Eppie demanded with great stateliness. But he had brought her to the verge of another word, and, having submitted herself to be humbled so far, she cried behind her kerchief more vehemently than ever. Captain Robert was now indeed blessed; his honest eyes were opened to the simple fact, and he accepted it with the most profound gratitude. Ay, of course, he preferred the warm love pressed close to his bosom, to the pity which, like charity, is pale and cold, and hovers at a distance. It was sweet to the sailor that these familiar, rude waves had so unexpectedly struck the first peal of his wedding bells."], [103, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 91 What remains to be told? Mistress Peggy was an authoritative mother to those silly, trauchled, hungry men, and though they could not interchange a word, they impressed her with their dignity, for she described Don Jan as \" a buirdly man of a sedate walk and con versation.\" Mr. James Melville, in spite of his downright de claration that there could be little friendship between them, had frequent friendly intercourse with the com mande~ gifting him with the few bottles of rich wine, presented to him by his kinsman, Henry Scrymgeour. In due time the party were honourably embarked and despatched to their master, who had made himself the laughing-stock of bluff Drake and Hawkins, with Europe at their back. Captain Joshua in the \" Lord Henry\" had come into port the day after the landing of the Spaniards, and had immediately sailed again along with Captain Robert in the \" Beacon,\" to hang as privateers on the skirts of the yet unmet Armada. Naturally enough, Captain Robert completed his work smartly, and glided into Anstruther harbour with the boom of the last Antwerp gun, to claim his bride before the winter storms should strew the coast with wrecks. But Captain Joshua tarried in the chase of the defeated enemy, and Mistress Peggy was decided that the wedding which would make two pier-heads gay should not be concluded without his august countenance. This Captain Joshua, on whom the old lady laid such stress, was not so indispensable a personage to others."], [104, "Days of Yore. 92 He was a little man, Mistress Peggy's junior in every thing; quiet and subdued on shore, though proved a trusty guide on the inconstant element on which he had sailed so long, that it was almost as native to him as to the swift careering curlew or curtseying little wild duck. But he was the head of Mistress Peggy's family, the sole remnant of her generation, and for full fifty years she had insisted on paying him deference. There was something touching in the independent old lady's fidelity, and in the eagerness with which she bent the head and wore the coif to unexacting Captain Joshua, clinging to the vestige of her womanly alle giance, cased as she was in her armour of self-reliance, stubbornness, and sarcasm. Captain Joshua did not return, though there were eager hearts awaiting him. Magnanimous Captain Ro bert grew urgent in his suit. No, Mistress Peggy was obdurate, the \" Lord Henry\" was safe, Captain Joshua had never seen the dungeons of the Inquisition, his merry men sang out nightly \" all's well,\" and Anster had not succoured the benighted Spaniard in vain. \" Mistress Peggy,\" urged Captain Robert, \" I maun sail with the spring winds, and I would fain wed my Eppie. You would not send a man abroad in his honey moon. If we be parted as we stand, I'll not be less stout, I'll maybe grow grey ere I halt, and likelier lads may woo my lass when my back is turned.\" \"Awa' with you, man; gin ye cannot depend upon her for ae voyage, how will ye trust her for twa lives?\""], [105, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 93 Mistress Peggy was white and restless as she over whelmed her persecutors with reproaches ; but she would not be overborne by their longings or by their terrors, and so the bridegroom tarried for his bride, until on one white, watery November dawn the \" Lord Henry\" rode within hail, and the boat from its side had Captain Joshua in the stern, and Roger Swanson was rowing the first oar, that he might the sooner present his child to the Lord, and, at the same time, slip into the long handled wooden ladle his thanksofferings from his prize money. And young Eppie Melville, in the flush of her strength and delicate bloom, was selected to carry the babe in his caul and mantle all the way up the church aisle, blushing and bridling in a bewitching maidenly fashion, all because she was a sailor's neice, and about to become a sailor's wife. But where had the loiterers lingered ? They had brought home a rare experience. They had followed in the wake of the ruins of the Armada, and, following too far, had floundered into the circle of six galleons, and been captured and towed under the white walls of Cadiz. There they heard the salute and cries of vengeance and oaths of retribution, till the stalwart figure of Don Jan Gomez rose upon their glad sight, and forced a passage to their side. Don Jan was not ashamed to own them, he entertained them like a frank sailor, he pleaded and prayed for them, and so they were out of the gloomy grip of Philip. They were with casks of purple raisins, and barrels of snow-white flour, and boxes of oranges and figs, and American sugar, and runlets of"], [106, "Dzys of Yore. 94 wine, and Don Jan and his captains had inquired \" for the Laird of Anstruther and the minister,\" and every good man of the Anster towns. Mistress Peggy was a happy woman, and proud be yond easy bearing, till Captain Joshua was sly enough to whisper a private message from her strange friend. Then indeed, she started up, her stately face in a flame, and working with half angry, half confused laughter. \" The presumptuous peat ! the light-headed auld fule ! to mint sic madness. To even an East Neuk woman of douce years to be Donna to a philandering, doited Don ; he had better speer my hand in the dance next. A hantle more fitting he were ordering his burial, like his King Charles. And though he had been in his prime, like Captain Robert, and I had been youthful and glaiket, like that weathercock Eppie, would a woman of the Covenant have cast an ee on a besotted son of the Pope of Rome ? It is an idle jest, Captain Joshua, and it sets you no that weel to repeat it.\" James Melville fell into some blunders and many tribulations in his career. But it is not at all probable that he ever regretted his brief intercourse with Don Jan and his crew any more than his other gentle largesses. Significantly enough, this talent of giving is the trait by which he is best remembered in his old place. He who had received so thrifty an example from the representative of the Stewarts, that he declared of the short period of his court sojourn, \"as for gifts from the court, I sought none, and I got none unsought,\" showed a different practice in the rights of fishing, which be bought from"], [107, "Peggy Melville's Triumph. 95 the Laird of Anstruther and presented to the Kirk ; the manse which he built, and with which he endowed the parish ; the school which he upheld by his heavily taxed means ; as well as in the golden angels which he sent to Mr. Andrew in the tower, with the royal sentence, \" shall send you money, and you shall send me songs.\""], [108, "THE SHADOW OF THE \"ANCIENT MARINER\" \" \"IT THERE is he, Niel? Point him out, man, ere he pass by. Ah ! yonder he goes. He has nodded to Elspa Hoy ; the Sealchraigs and the Hoys were aye thrang. How proud the cummer looks of the notice ! It is well that Magnus Guthrie is lying in Kirkcaldy Bay. Michty, man, he looks like ony ordinary mortal ; there's no shadow on his face, nor stammer on his tongue, though they tell me he is scant of speech, and cannot bide the looks of human creatures like himsel'. There \u2014 he's aff to the boat to lie out till night, firing at the solan geese and fishing for mackerel; or he'll be up the field to the Law or the Links, shooting the rabbits, or sitting dumb for hours, smoking and gazing upon the town. A queer chap, never a' thegither richt. Lucky Browne could tell you how he fended as a wean. He might be canny with a woman, but he never 'greed with a man ; they say he was even thrawn to Woods Rogers.\" At this climax the hearers set up a general exclamation ere they dispersed on the beach. Speaker and audience"], [109, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner.\" 97 were decent fishers and country people, engaged in carting weed from the sands of Largo. The object of their eager remarks was a sullen-faced, huge, thick-set man, in canvas trousers, woollen shirt and jacket, and leather cap, who crossed their path silently, and strode along the narrow shore, his dark, far-sunk eyes gazing seawards. What figure could be less propitious for a hero than this one so rudely attired ? Yet for a hundred years the son of the poor woman who confessed to \" the troubled spirit,\" the brother of a set of turbulent fellows, the mutinous mate of the Cinque Ports, has been the delight of young hearts ! And at that moment, with his grim and gruff personality, he was turning a little head, wont to be shrewd enough among the heads of the womankind of Largo. It is not proven that this old Alexander Sealchraig bore much resemblance to the plain, very human Robin son Crusoe, who made another such entrance into the world as did the famous Gulliver. The real man was more romantic. He was of the Byronic school, gloomy and morose, and with sudden torrents of passion, lava like, tearing through his rocky nature. He was capable, too, of grand impulses and remarkable determinations, such as generally present themselves as sad relics in strong souls. He was born like Dean Swift himself perhaps, only uncorrupted by ambition \u2014 an ignorant, savage twin-brother in fact, but not so well suited for the great novelist's purpose, of placing the familiar and homely in a single-handed encounter with what was H"], [110, "98 Days of _ 'ore. altogether foreign and strange. But the man's character signified little ; it was the matchless circumstances in which he was placed, and out of which grew that story which he has bequeathed to the world as his inalienable possession. In Largo there linger to this day cottages, sac similes of that in which Alexander Sealchraig and his brothers and sisters were born. They are mud -cemented, thatch roofed buildings, with irregular abutments in the roof and in the walls. Small windows of different sizes are strewn over the front, and a slit forming a recess is seen at the side of the fire, which contains a shelf bearing the Dutch stoneware mugs and pewter tankards then in use. Such was the home of a well-to-do family of their class. The room was so small and low that its roof cramped a tall man. Its box-beds were gay with bright-patched quilts, and its loft or upper chamber served as girnel, aumrie, and linen-press, sufficient space being boarded off as a sleeping closet. When, as in this case, it was scrupulously clean, it presented the best specimen of that cheerful quality of \" couthiness\" which most of the stoical Scotch nation appreciate. Home-breathing and sweet to the humble are these accessories. Very pre cious were they to Mrs. Hoy, the old widow of the young sailor in the whaler, whose vessel sailed to the northern seas twice ten years ago, vanished among the icebergs, nor ever again wore the garland in Kirkaldy Bay. Very dear also were they to the widow's only child Elspa, in her early spring-time and freedom from care, spinning the whole morning; or losing half the"], [111, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner.\" 99 afternoon sitting under the grey walls of the old ruined castle of Balcruivie ; or climbing the Law under sure escort, to see the sunset on the longest day. Pleasant to most unvitiated eyes would have been the sitting-room of the two honest, kind women. Specially would it have been so at night, when the light from the fire or the \" cruizie \" fell on the white walls, the brown kists and cupboard, and the little round table, a shade higher in rank than the common deal table in the corner of the yellow-sprinkled floor, and scrubbed very white with sand. The long shadow of the clock would fall on Elspa's bullfinch in its wicker cage, Elspa rivalling it in song as she turned her wheel, and quite beating it in beauty. Elspa, with her trig purple-striped petticoat of that heather bloom hue of the linsey-woolsey, and her clean buff and white jacket tucked in by her white apron, was a brown beauty \u2014 brown and warm, with dark auburn hair only twisted out of curl, and mouth, cheeks, and eyes like tropical fruit, so rich and warm that these cold east winds could not wither nor blight them, as they did the charms of fair beauties who waxed pale and sickly. The cottage was bright with Elspa Hoy's presence. And then her mother was the quietest, most industrious and benevolent of old women \u2014 one of those who say so little and think so much \u2014 whose pro fession is hidden, but their practice true Christianity, and who have withal a shy humour which is worth many quick speeches and much ready wit. Elspa was quick alike in comprehension, in feeling, in temper. Her flashes of anger would sometimes bring the tears into her H 2"], [112, "Days of Yore. 100 grey eyes, and sparkles of laughter would as suddenly dry them again. But although Elspa was very winning in her ways, and Magnus Guthrie thought her \" the daintest of all,\" she was still far below the pale-faced, fine-featured old woman, in the snowy curch and the black hood, with the \" toy \" on her shoulders, and the scarlet mantle when she walked abroad. The cottage was pleasant in the morning, too, when the women were busy \u2014 Mrs. Hoy baking scones and cakes, or brewing mint tea and marigold broth, or sweeping and scouring with neat thoroughness and con tentment ; and Elspa spinning in earnest her allotted \u2022\u2022 spindles \" of yarn, though they were in tolerably easy circumstances ; thanks to the poor young sailor of the \" Enterprise.\" In those days it would have been thought discreditable to a girl like Elspa if she had not been clever\" al work and able to support herself with her W D bands.

She was never idle, but she \u00ab.;s uot parsimonious. There was nothing like dreary confinement or slavish toil in the Hoys'. On the Contrary, u was reckoned a very lightsome dwelling to be inhabited by two fame women, and was popular in the I -ice. and respected too, though it must be confessed with an occasional peevish or scornful respect. Few ot the Largo people were so independent in their cir-"], [113, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner'.' 101 cumstances, and so nice in their habits, as Mrs. Hoy, and human nature is very much the same everywhere\u2014 what they could not or would not copy, the Largo people were bold enough to despise or resent. But real malice against the Hoys was scarce ; and there was a common notion that it was complimentary to associate with them ; for Mrs. Hoy was refined, and Elspa a wilful difficult young girl, whom it was not easy to hold unless you inspired her with genuine regard, and then Elspa would have gone through fire or water for a friend. The Hoys' house was fragrant and picturesque when Elspa set it out with cowslips, gathered where they grew largest and thickest in sheltered hollows in the links. In summer she would bring down red ling in bundles from the summit of the Law, and in autumn she was sure to obtain the golden straw \" maiden,\" from some of the crofts, and tie it up with snood ribands, and fasten it for the winter above the chimney. Friends in ships that coasted Holland, Prussia, France, or Spain brought them bits of crystal, Delft and wooden work, wreaths or nose gays of artificial flowers, as well as curious engravings ; and they had still more remote tokens in stuffed birds of gaudy plumage, and shells, and corals, whose gorgeous tints once shone under southern seas. At the end of the dwelling stood the small cow-house for the little golden-brown Ayrshire cow. It also sheltered, during night, the cock and half-a-dozen hens, Fries landers probably, but tender when young, and fat when of age, and indefatigable in laying, as all the sick folk in Largo could have proven. But there was no wonder that"], [114, "102 Days of Yore. Mrs. Hoy had named her cow, like Magnus Guthrie's ship, Lady Jean : many a real lady was less tenderly treated. How softly she lay on dried bracken, how carefully Elspa led her to the sunny sloping field at the foot of the Law, where daughter or mother would sit for hours on a knoll, with knitting in hand, guarding their treasure. They often milked her in the open air in summer, to save her, not themselves, a trudge : they spoke of, and to her, as a friend, while she would turn after them her sedate head and sensible eyes. Indeed, one of the few things on which Mrs. Hoy and Elspa were disposed to be dogmatic was the universal superiority of Lady Jean. In addition to the house and its treasures there was \" the yaird,\" with its hardy vegetables, honeysuckle bower shading the bench facing the sea, and edges of thrift, aromatic thyme and balm, tall camomile, June roses \u2014 those \" wee white cockades \" yet to be sung by fond Jacobites. There were likewise early pinks, whose honey-filled lilac, white, and crimson tufts, flourish bravest in cottage gardens; and the old apple tree, which in extraordinary seasons bore a fair crop of pale yellow apples, should not be forgotten. This garden was crowned by a pig-sty, whose tenant, like the Archbishop of Canterbury, never died, because before one animal was sacrificed another was in presence to be proclaimed heir to the broo, the fresh straw, and the kind attention which rendered the life of the doomed hog an untar nished pleasure. It was evident that the Hoys enjoyed what in Scotland"], [115, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner'.' 103 is often called \" a fulness,\" both within and without their precincts. Perhaps it was one of the crowning advan tages of their situation that their tenement, as well as every other lodging in Largo proper, was built on the verge of the beach. The pure sea breezes swept through the meanest boll that served as window and over slat ternly floor or wretched pallet bed. A dozen yards brought the most of the inhabitants to the well washed sands, and afforded them the most inexpensive and invaluable of halls and drawing-rooms, where men and women worked, smoked, and gossipped without danger of offence to eye or ear. There Elspa could run down in the morning and bathe her pretty feet, and there she could loiter for a last draught of air under the rising moon without even her careful mother considering her exposed to unwelcome observation. No doubt it was a failing, or bordering on a failing, in this pair \u2014 that touch of pride which sprouts up so often in the most honourable natures, that the gentle Scots are agreed it is one of these faults which lean to virtue's side. In Mrs. Hoy it was a very modest and, so to speak, meek pride ; in Elspa it was something considerably earthlier. Still even in Elspa, with all her liveliness, there was neither harshness nor haughtiness. Both mother and daughter were well satisfied that Magnus Guthrie, Elspa's favoured suitor, was come of creditable and solvent people, and had been promoted to be second mate on board the large schooner the \" Lady Jean,\" sailing from Kirkaldy to the Baltic for timber. This Magnus Guthrie was a big, honest, affectionate,"], [116, "104 Days of Yore. reverent young fellow, who seemed born to be lucky in his fortunes. His berth was a very desirable one\u2014 stated voyages during the short summer when the northern harbours were open, and in the long winter power to remain at home and work at the trade of ship carpenter. When he cast his eyes, where there were other admirers in plenty before him, on lovely, joyous Elspa Hoy, of still better folk than himself, and with an ample providing, he was the reverse of sanguine, and almost despaired \u2014 Elspa was so coy and contradictory. Yet he felt himself warranted to construct (what was entirely out of his branch of the chisel and saw) the most ingenious of stools, quilting frames, baking-boards, and the prettiest, lightest pair of water stoups, in anticipation of the time when Elspa should condescend to inhabit the comfortable house along the coast, which her mother, unselfishly contented to resign her child, would be active enough to visit with the help of a cast in a cart, or a good rest in a half-way house in Leven or Dysart. So far all had been calm weather. Elspa was spinning her last web, Mrs. Hoy was salting Elspa's butter, and \" yearning \" her cheese, and watching the set fruit on the single tree, and calculating that if it did as well next season she would have a hoard to fill Elspa's drawer \" yont the coast.\" But now a shadow was on their path : it lay darkest on Elspa, but reached also to Magnus and Mrs. Hoy. Alexander Sealchraig came to the house, whose dead master had been one of his few, few friends. He was gracious to Mrs. Hoy, and smiled his rare smile on Elspa. It was quite natural that even that dark."], [117, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner.\" 105 reserved man should like to come to this peaceful cottage. It was natural that Mrs. Hoy should not forbid him, and should almost angrily refuse to see danger to her daughter in the contact. It was to be expected, too, that Elspa should be flattered by the notice of one so distinguished in his way, so much made of, when in England, by the fine gentlemen of London (DickSteele among the rest), so often invited to Largo Place, and above all so chary in his kindness to the rest of the world. Matters did not end here. Elspa, to a casual observer, might have seemed an unimaginative, common-sense woman, because she was a blithe lass and very gay and decided. But whether sea-bred children are all fanciful, or whether the frozen mystery of her father's fate melted into an atmosphere of dreams round his connections, or whether the true romance dealer is the merry soul to whom a vision is a secret and a stolen refuge \u2014 whatever it was, Elspa was in a manner fascinated by this Seal chraig. What was good-natured, steady Magnus, with his clear blue eyes, and his soft flaxen hair, that gave a shade of boyishness to his otherwise stalwart manhood, to this square-shouldered, black-browed man, who had stood self-sufficing on yon islet in the wide ocean, and who had slept and waked alone through whole years of darkness and dawn ? What were Magnus's unvarying matter-of-fact accounts of Memel, and Dantzic, and Stettin, to Sealchraig's words, when he vouchsafed them, of the feathery palm and the spreading banyan, the golden sands and the vine-matted rocks, the mischievous monkeys and jabbering parrots, the goats he had followed"], [118, "106 Days of Yore. up the precipices, the turtle he had caught in the caves, the flowers in the dense wood dusky at noon, and his hut, which no companion's eye had seen, and where no comrade's foot had rested ? The gorgeous beauty, the rank luxuriance of the tropics fluttered constantly before Elspa's imagination. She saw, too, the massive figure of the Largo man night and day moving like a spectre. She saw him on the look-out in the morning, and beheld him return laden with spoil to the great silence, broken only by animal cries, and where no household voice greeted him, praised his success, or wished him good cheer. What were Magnus's whispers of the \" bien house \" he had striven to procure on the links of Kirkaldy, away from the din and smoke of the town and near the sea, with a draw-well like crystal within a stone's-throw, and a sheltering hedge of the coarser wild clematis, to those delusive pictures of the warm air, the constant sunshine, the perfect liberty, the blood-ied orange, \"the apple on the pine,\" and the flocks of agile kids gambolling round it ? Like most young fools, Elspa was reckless enough not to ask where such reflections were to end. She was willing to be impressed and enchanted by what was so novel to her, and so alluring. She only knew as yet that she was proud of Alexander Sealchraig's friendship, glad when he visited them, and interested to inspect the hollow cup, carved out of cocoa-nut, and \" the cedar kist,\" which held his ordinary clothes, as well as those manu factured from the goats' skins in his banishment. Mrs. Hoy felt the influence likewise, though in a much"], [119, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner? 107 milder form. It was to her like reading some of the tales of her youth to listen to Sealchraig's marvellous descriptions and wonderful adventures. She would have counted it a sin and shame to deny him a hospitable reception after all his perils and hardships, and when he might now be spared to repent of all his errors. But she had never admitted to herself that Sealchraig's visits were to interfere with Magnus Gutherie's position. Why should they ? Sealchraig did not utter a syllable of love \u2014 Elspa was not light or false. It was a strange circumstance for Mrs. Hoy to complain of her friends' treatment, but her integrity resented the slight put upon herself and her daughter by those injurious suspicions. Thus these two women sat like poor Hester Johnson and her friend, and that middle-aged, surly, mighty man swayed their destinies. Fortunately, or unfortunately, it was the summer time, when Magnus's double or triple trips broke the months, and he was kept in the flurry and turmoil of a succession of departures and returns. Formerly it had been an agreeably suggestive scene, when Magnus, with his invariable bundle, took his good-bye, and lingered for the last word behind the door, Mrs. Hoy prudently hurry ing her own adieux, and retreating into the back ground. Now there was constraint upon all parties, dissatisfaction and bitterness, while there was no encounter or explanation between Sealchraig and Magnus Guthrie, the fierce and forbidding spirit of the man negativing any extreme remedy. The Law lay under the hot July sun ; the fishers were seated on their sills, holding conclave on the approaching"], [120, "108 Days of Yore. herring-draw, or treating of the grievance os the royal frigate and the press-gang breaking out ever and anon on the coasts ; the coopers' carts, with their spick and span barrels, were rattling in, and making a noise in the other wise stagnant village, when Magnus Guthrie stepped up the street to announce his last arrival for the year to the girl who was to have wedded him at Martinmas. Poor Magnus was no elated traveller hieing home. He was wearied, down-hearted, and rather nervous as to the news he was to hear, and the faces he was to look upon. He waved off the idle boatmen, who were charmed to receive him and hear his news of the voyage, more moodily than accorded with his patient, cordial disposition. Mrs. Hoy was knitting at the door, and, by a hasty glance, Magnus was thankful to find that Elspa was alone, setting out the milk, bannock, and cheese, before the window, thus intercepting the familiar light, while the sunset glow was dusting her dark hair with grains of gold, and barring her round throat. \" Oh come awa, Magnus, come awa, my man,\" cried the old woman : \" Is it you, Magnus ?\" exclaimed Elspa in friendly enough phrase, but with the stiffness of dead or strayed affection in her looks and accent. A horror of doubt and anger fell on the poor fellow, yet he did not fail to mark that Elspa blushed rosily. \" Ah,\" he sighed within himself, \" was it love or shame that made her blush ? \" His own manner was so absent and awkward, that it might have defied the frankest and freest regard to penetrate it. So it went on, food was offered and swallowed, topics forced and sustained by an effort, the"], [121, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner'.' 109 one subject of vital interest sedulously avoided, and trifles played with and bandied about from one to the other. Mrs. Hoy was disturbed and scared. She hoped the couple would be better alone ; perhaps the two who were so deeply interested would recover their right reason when left to themselves. So she offered an excuse, and moved gently out of the room. Elspa sat down to the wheel and forked the thread, and asked an incoherent question now and then, but never looked up. The young man rose sorrowfully and stood over her. \" I had better have staid awa, Elspa, \" he said abruptly, \" I'm no wanted here ; the fisher fellows, I wot, are more concerned about my welfare.\" \" If you like to think sae, Magnus \" \u2014 Elspa returned somewhat hotly, and stopped short. \" You'll gather more wit, Elspa, my woman,\" had been her mild mother's most frequent rebuke. He had spoiled her, this foolish lad, that was so ready to take her up on a little provocation, and so punish her and himself, not from irritability and arrogance, but from modesty and self-depreciation. \" I do not think it, Elspa ; I see it, and I could make up my mind to it ; but how can you prosper after you've forsaken me and drawn up with that hard man ? \" \" Dinna ban a better man than yoursel' behind his back, Magnus Guthrie,\" objected Elspa. \" I ban no man,\" answered Magnus stoutly ; \" I ken Alexander Sealchraig is a wonderful man, more wonderful even than my Lord Colville, but he is a hard dour man."], [122, "Days of Yore. 110 Why God should have elected such to work wonders I cannot tell \u2014 it may be decreed \u2014 but he is a dark mate for you, Elspa, and darkest if he carry you awa from your auld mother and Largo Kirk, to his fine foreign lands, where the air is aye full of the music of birds, and where there is none to say him nay, unless it be heathen savages.\" \" Never mind me, Magnus,\" declared Elspa proudly ; \" I can take care of mysel'. \" \" Poor lass, poor lass, it is just what you canna do, your act does not look like it,\" groaned Magnus, of course greatly exasperating Elspa, who was not accus tomed to be pitied. Then he changed his tone, and attempted to pacify her, and beguiled her to his side of the question: \"Will you deny it, Elspa, wifie? I'll credit your last word, and we'll never mention him again, but be together in peace and happiness as we were before.\" \" I deny nothing, Magnus,\" cried Elspa, springing up; \" and I say you have no right to bring charges against me, and then force me to conter you or any other man or woman in these lies.\" \" You deny nothing, Elspa ? Then I must tell you, that I mean to close with a place in an India-bound vessel, where I have a chance of being wrecked and cast away, and becoming upsides with Sealchraig. I could not come back and breed strife between friends, and I sail never see your face mair, Elspa Hoy,\" and he left the cottage. Elspa did not believe him, or she would have done"], [123, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner.\" 111 more than cry passionately after his departure. When she was composed again, she looked about her, and found a little packet, which Magnus had left behind him. It was an ivory ring for that rock of her wheel, which, like other happy girls, she had been fond of \" busking \" and tying up with ribands. She tried it on the flax, while the tears flowed, and then, with difficulty, inserted it in her broad pocket, lest her mother should see it and praise the gift \u2014 she felt it would half kill her now to hear this admiration of a gift which she would otherwise have been very proud to exhibit. Mrs. Hoy came in anxiously, but was delicately silent. Elspa was compelled to volunteer her information, which she did with her back to the light, beating all the while with her foot on the floor. \" Magnus and I have had words, mother,\" she said with feigned levity; \" he wishes to break with me \u2014 he'll ne'er settle in the lang toon of Kirkaldy \u2014 he's bound for the Indies, without return.\" Neither did her mother believe it. She only said, \" Whisht, whisht, bairn, and learn mair wit,\" a little more vexedly than usual. Elspa was comforted by her mother's incredulity, and she prepared to make the supper. Elspa tossed upon her bed all through the long night. She had never heard the ripple on the shore so distinctly and continuously. When she did sleep, the rich Indies and Alexander Sealchraig's island were mixed in horrible confusion in her dreams. She sometimes fancied too that she was condemned to occupy the \" braw \" house prepared for her in Kirkaldy, in dismal widowhood,"], [124, "Days of Yore. 112 as her mother had done this cottage in Largo, until her heart was sick within her, and she rose faint and feverish in the early morning. \" Never mind the breakfast, bairn, I'll boil the parritch ; step you out and try the caller air for half an hour. It has been a warm nicht, a vera warm nicht,\" added Mrs. Hoy in tender fraud. Elspa crept out under the concealment of her mother's plaid ere the town was \" asteer.\" An early boat was approaching the shore, bait diggers were abroad, but the sands were almost solitary. The long, low waves broke with a dash, as they do at full tide, even in calm weather, and the fresh sight and sound seemed to calm the air ; sea and sky were one limpid blue, backed by that bank of haze which precedes a sultry day. \" It will be very warm to-day. What will we do ? \" asked Elspa of herself, as if the weather was her only concern, and one of utmost moment. She tried the foot bridge to Dromachie, where there was always a cool breeze round the point. The disabled boats, and those that had not been out the previous night, lay swinging lazily side by side, where the sea meets the turbid inland water. But there was another person stirring here, though the change-house remained quiet. A muscular man with a gun, was leaning upon the old store-house. Elspa turned and fled, she trusted she had not been seen. He had no cause to follow her, but she was frightened to look behind her till she was on the beach below her mother's house ; then her heart misgave her, when she found that Alexander Sealchraig was close at her back."], [125, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner'.' 113 \"You are in a hurry, Elspa,\" he said coolly, \"but we may meet at the Black Craigs at sundown any day this week.\" Elspa stared and shook a little, What could the man mean ? Why should she see him out of her mother's company? And what could he have to say to her? And then, as Elspa wondered, she descried another manly figure, standing listlessly, or not caring to be recognised, as it bent over an old sea-wall. She made a pretence of inquisitively inspecting this man, when Seal chraig repeated, without softening his voice, \"At the Black Craigs any sundown this week, Elspa,\" and then nodded and went by. Elspa darted up into the house, with a face pale like a lily. \" Elspa, bairn, you're no a bit ruddier ; you cannot stand the heat, and maun keep the house till the evening; sirs, the threavers and bandsters setting out for Newburn will be sore oppressed the day.\" \" I'll stay with you always, mother,\" gasped Elspa, and she clung about her mother, and would not move from her side, or venture from the door, not only that day, but for the next two or three days, when the flush of amber light mocked at care. She shrank from the tidings that were slow to come. No token from Magnus or Sealchraig, no message, no reappearance of either of them ; Elspa expressed no sur prise or anger, but rather uttered a sigh of relief that this truce in her life was still unbroken. Mrs. Hoy took a resolution, which she only did for Elspa's sake ; she discovered that she had not heard from her cousin in Dysart these twelve months past, and 1"], [126, "114 Days of Yore. found that she must avail herself of these long cloudless days to walk along the coast and inquire for her and her asthmatic husband. She donned her scarlet mantle, filled her basket with her snowiest dried fish, and her warmest hose and mittens, and started leisurely to travel on foot to her kinswoman's. She would be back again before the evening star had vanished from the sky. Elspa was left to keep house, mind the cow, and pursue her own devices. She was very grave and indus trious all the morning, but became restless towards the afternoon, and was impelled upon an expedition all her own. Elspa was aware that she had encountered both the men about whom she was concerned in the sunrise of the warm summer morning. They had both frightened her, \u2014 Sealchraig by the audacity of his proposal, and Magnus by the sternness of his avoidance, so very far removed from his old zealous, lowly courtship. She had feared that Magnus had heard Sealchraig's strange appointment. She had trembled vaguely for terrible consequences, for Magnus in his love was no worm that any man might trample upon. Her fear had not been confirmed, but to-day, after her mother left, a long tongued, flippant, forward neighbour, such as exists in all regions, had looked in upon her. \" What's this that has come over you a', Elspa?\" she said; \"isna there word of Magnus Guthrie sailing for the Indies ? Is the mar riage gane aff, or are you waiting for mair sillar ? Dinna be covetous, lass, or you'll maybe rue it.\" Though this was no more than Elspa had been told by Magnus him self, the public rumour filled her with dismay."], [127, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner.\" 115 Then an idea struck Elspa, when her nerves were strung to this perilous pitch, that she might end the intolerable suspense by keeping the tryst which Seal chraig had appointed. The week was not expired, she might meet one or both of the missing men. Sealchraig and Magnus might both be awaiting her, she might yet be in time to prevent their coming in contact, she would hear the cause of their withdrawal ; it would be some thing to be done, and not merely to be borne. Elspa locked the door, leapt up, and deposited the key conveniently beneath the thatch, where any properly instructed person could find it. Then she hurried on, instinctively avoiding the observers, nor paused till she was fairly on the road and out of sight ; her head uncovered, and her house jacket on, bound for the Black Craigs by Johnstone's mill. It was a considerable distance, through solitary links and sands, and Elspa was quite spent with heat and fatigue when she arrived at her destination. Not a person was to be seen, either out on the black reef, or up the little gully, with the trickling water brushed by whins, ending in a few trees, and containing a single well-shrouded house. Elspa was half disappointed, half relieved as she sat down to rest, and almost enjoy the unusual bushes, where even bushes, except in these dens, are rare. But the rural spot was an ill-omened locality, as she soon called to mind. She knew the grave of the unhappy ship wrecked Englishman, waved over by the coarse sea-grass, blown over by the sea gales, the very place, too, where 1 2"], [128, "116 Days of Yore. he had groaned out his life in solitude. Sealchraig must have pondered its details well, for it was a favourite haunt of his, and yet one would have thought scarcely a scene to choose for a rendezvous with a child like Elspa. All at once a foot moved the stones below, and Seal chraig sprang up the pathway alone. Elspa's heart beat so violently, that she could scarcely catch his expression or even his words, but she thought afterwards that he was smiling, and that he said, \" I knew you would be here, Elspa.\" Then he stood silent for a moment lost in thought, as was his wont, ere he pointed significantly to his boat moored by the rocks, and with a rude awning over the stern. He offered to take her hand. \"The boat is ready, Elspa, and the ship is ready too at the pier of Leith. Fair winds and a year's time will bring us to the island where my trees spread high and wide, and my flowers bloom as bright as they did in Eden, and my faithful birds and beasts await me. There we'll rear our own altar, lass, and own our ain soil. There are no clash ing tongues there, Elspa, no inquisitive een, no master, no mate. We will have room to breathe and to live for our selves. There I will make you a lady and a queen, feed you with the tenderest flesh, and most luscious fruit, clothe you in the softest skins, and crown you with a single devotion, instead of rendering you the working wife among working women, which yon lad in his coarse ness proposed. So we will live, till we dee together as we have lived, Elspa, our common wants supplied by a strong arm, fair sights enjoyed by a keen sight, where life is pure sweetness and pleasure.\""], [129, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner'.' i 1 7 Elspa closed her eyes. She would not have listened to the marvellous wile, but despair lay at her heart, and despair lends wings to temptation, while it weighs down, as with the dull ponderousness of lead, the beaten round of daily duties. She had lost Magnus, and she had loved him ; how she had loved him she never knew till now. She knew not how she would support the old routine of labour and repose without his image. Might she not, therefore, listen to the talk of distance and change, of another world of luxuriance and sensuous indulgence and the utmost liberty ? But her eye fell on the ivory band of her rock, which lay on her knee, just as she had passed it from her pocket, to steal a look at it, ere Sealchraig surprised her. With a great bound, her unstable heart went back to the hours and the circum stances under which Magnus sought her to be the work ing wife at whom Sealchraig sneered. It was near Largo Kirk, between the preachings, so common a period for rural courtship ; a season, to honest pious minds, not unseemly for any serious purpose. \" The better day, the better deed,\" says the old proverb, and the adjuncts were not wanting in the most purifying influences. Magnus and Elspa had felt them so. They had been quiet, solemn, too solemn Elspa had fancied in her wayward ness afterwards, though she had not judged so at the time when Magnus ventured to give his promise, \" I will try to be a good son to your widow mother, Elspa.\" There was bitterness in the contrast now forced before her; but it was a bitterness which restored to Elspa health and strength, and knowledge to discern the awful,"], [130, "118 Days of Yore. almost diabolic selfishness of the isolation which Seal chraig so exalted before her. \" Never, Alexander Sealchraig, never will I desert my kind in their joys and cares, however hardly they deal with me, so long as I can lend them a helping hand ; I will never quit my dear auld mither, while I can smooth her grey hairs ; forbye I cannot break my troth.\" Elspa paused and covered her face in shame and sorrow. When she lifted up her head again, she observed like a lightning flash, the same slouching figure which had hung over the sea-wall, disappear in the thicket of the little den. Her emotion burst all bonds of pride and reserve : \" Yonder he is, I maun speak to him this minute. Farewell, Sealchraig ;\" and she darted after the stranger, that she could have sworn was Magnus Guthrie. Sealchraig shouted to her to stop, he even levelled his gun at her, for he was like to be a fierce wooer. But though Elspa had heard the report, and seen the flash in the pan, she would neither have stood still nor fallen prostrate, unless he had shot her through the heart. She sped through the cover, but no man was visible. Sand bunkers were there, sufficient to hide a score of men ; besides this might be but a waking dream. But no, Elspa was convinced that she had met both the men again in the body, or out of the body, as it might be, and hurried on. Through the tears in her eyes, Elspa thought she caught another glimpse of him, but it was a more momentary vagary than the mirage of the desert. Fol lowing the burn by the Links, these cruel bunkers inter posing again and again, Elspa at last reached her own"], [131, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner. 119 door without further sign. The key was in the thatch, the house was quiet, and it was clear no friend had been there before her. To shun colloquy with neighbour or acquaintance, Elspa walked straight in, closed the house door and flung her apron over her head to shut out the light from her great grief. And Elspa had lost the ivory ring of her rock, and dared not go back to seek it : it was a great cross to her, this. So her mother found Elspa on her return : she only murmured that home was sweet, and asked her daughter to hang up her mantle, inquiring how the cow had fared. She told Elspa that her eldest cousin Gib was to accompany old lady Orrock to Edinbro as a waiting-woman and companion, and that her folk were justly uplifted about the appointment. And then standing on the hearth, in the gloaming, with her shrivelled, shaking hand on her child's shoulder, she at last said, \" You maun make up your mind to the truth, my lass : Magnus is misled, he has taken a passage to the Indies, to sail as soon as the ship's lading is complete. I spak with a Kirkaldy man who heard the bargain.\" \" I must prevent it, mother : I must lose no time : I must see Magnus the morn,\" cried Elspa, composed and resolute, with a pale fixedness of determination. Mrs. Hoy shook her head. \" I'm wae to cross you or dash down your hopes, but a young lass can never follow a man, however they have been bound.\" \" Dinna prevent me, mother ; dinna put me up against him at the last moment, when I have not another to lose ; dinna keep me back and break my heart,\" said the young girl in agony."], [132, "Days of Yore. 120 Mrs. Hoy sustained a struggle with her own purity of heart. She could not conceive an overwhelming obstacle to Elspa's simple purpose; but then she was jealous for their good name and womanly dignity. But Elspa's prayers prevailed, and then she was so far lightened as to confess Sealchraig's demand, which had come to excuse Magnus's madness, and to appal Mrs. Hoy. \" It was mean in Magnus to jink about and never come near me and aye misdoubt me. I never failed in trust in Magnus, though I might try him. Yes, mother, I ken you warned me that he cudna remain the same, that when we were man and wife we would change places, for these douce men when they are up in anger are the worst to cool down ; but I thought he would never fail to be gude to me ; that he would never, never hurt me,\" reflected Elspa, her old spirit rising up again. Next day Elspa started, as her mother had done, in the early morning, and under the screen of her mother's red cloak ; the old woman only stating that Elspa was gone from home to see \" a friend.\" Oh ! that weary journey. It is a good many miles from Largo to Kirkaldy, and Elspa travelled with the young limbs that, though eager, are soon craving rest, and the heavy heart which is dreary company, and dreariest of all to the young. Mrs. Hoy would have had Elspa borrow other associations, but Elspa insisted on carrying out her plan unshackled by observation or interference. All her life long she would remember that journey \u2014 so lonely, so sorrowful, so humbling, though she was willing, in her innocence, sincerity, and"], [133, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner. 121 warmth of heart, to be chidden and to abase herself\u2014 to Magnus. The weather had changed. It was cold and gloomy above, while the earth was still green and golden below. But it was all the better so for Elspa. It was well that the sun did not beat upon the hot exposed head of the little girl that had been used to be so carefully guarded and kindly caressed, and to illumine the dusty clothes and anxious gait that were unnatural accompaniments of the light, round figure, and blooming, though harassed face. Past those mystical \" standing stones of Lundie;\" past the Orr and the Leven waters, where mills were already established ; past Dysart, with its salt-pans and pits; past the old ruinous castle of Ravenscraig, Elspa sped. Kirkaldy loomed before her mind's eye till she could scarcely advance for dread of beholding it. Still she went on, without pause for needful refreshment or rest. How would Magnus reward Elspa for her confession ? She might spare the question now, for there was the forest of masts, the noise and bustle, the jingle of chains and clash of anchors, the smells of tar and bilge water, the gleam of fires from braziers on deck, the slight variety of sailor costume and broad distinction of sailor visage ; everything that in day gives life, suggestive, robust, and vividly shaded, to the harbour of a populous sea-port. \" Too late, my lass, the ' Silver Trident ' sailed with her complement the last tide. You may see her empty"], [134, "Days of Yore. 122 berth forenent the ' St. David.' I hope, my dear, no Jack Tar has deceived you,\" an old sailor replied to Elspa's polite enquiry. A woman pulled him by the arm as he spoke. \" Whisht, whisht, Saunders ; you're a doited body. She's a decent lass, or she would have cried out. She said no more than that she had a bit errand to ane on board ; and now she has turned on her heel, though she's tottering as she goes. I'll spier if she'll tak a seat and a mouthfu' in our room ere she travel hame ; eh ! man, she's a young, bonny lass to come sic a gowk's errand.\" But Elspa would not break bread, nor bend her knees ; the spirit within would not let her. She felt as if a lion in the way would rend her if she tarried where she had heard those news. The cold gloom melted, and came down in drizzling, blinding rain. The girl had been the petted only daughter, the strong, simple man's admired, idolized mistress. Elspa's return is one of those great feats which most people perform once or twice in their lifetime. When she re-approached Largo, there, in spite of the wet, was her old mother secretly awaiting her. \" Oh ! why have you ventured out, mother, and pro voked your cough and your pains? You should pay more heed to yourseP, for I've nane left but you,\" cried Elspa, with a short, dry sob. \" My bairn, I had nane left but you when your father staid awa' for ever, and you will be enough for me till the Lord be pleased to tak me.\" But Elspa shuddered at the fond allusion."], [135, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner!' 123 Sealchraig too was gone, he was not seen after that afternoon when Elspa had the interview with him at the Black Craigs, by Johnstone's mill. His nearest relations, who knew him best, were not astonished at his sudden and silent departure. The inconstant summer weather would yield to the unbroken dreariness of winter, and spring would again burst the buds about that bare Largo border ere the \" Silver Trident \" was due in her owner's books. But then, at least, something would be heard of Magnus; then he would come back with the crew, or they would be ready to convey to him Elspa's recall. If Elspa Hoy had really seen Magnus Guthrie on these two last occasions, and if his likeness was not a warning that he was gone from her for ever, she still might hope. Naught was required but a little more patience and endurance (God wot, patience and endurance had now been learnt !) and the reward would be won. But the \" Silver Trident \" was not reported ; she was spoken of and spied after day by day, week by week, month by month, and still she hove not in sight. At length sober consultation and whispered doubt grew into loud apprehension and fear. She had foundered and gone to the bottom, with cargo and hands. There was many a treacherous sand-bank, bold jagged rock, bellyful of wind, and roaring breaker to dispatch the good ship, between Kirkaldy and the Indies. Elspa's patience and endurance were not yet perfected. She renounced all other occupation, and wandered about without fear of notice or of censure, classing herself"], [136, "Days of Yore. 124 among the mourning wives and children, to pray for a grain of mercy, a shade of hope, a miracle of Providence ; and Mrs. Hoy was wise enough to humour Elspa, and to comfort her : while she prayed constantly, and laboured indefatigably for the widows and orphans left destitute and desolate. When Elspa had nothing else to do she climbed the Law, and looked out wistfully as her mother had so often done before her. But her eye traversed not the magni ficent landward prospect from East Anstruther to Wemyss, with headland and bay, the mouths of the Leven and Cockle Mill, the plain rich in corn, with its one silver lochlet, the different eminences of Kelly Law, Balcarres Craig, Rores Hill, and the northern view of the Lomonds and Benartey, stretching away beyond the Tay into the dim highlands of Angusshire. No, she gazed ever o'er the glistening waters, which bore other sails in plenty, but not her sail. She would creep down languidly, while her mother was still waving on her. One day the chief gossip freely accosted Mrs. Hoy : \u2014 \" Dinna you ken, Mistress Hoy, folk hold it is a doom on the family? I am no' an auld woman, but I can mind of you yoursel' mounting the Law and staring in the wind, and then stumbling down, wi' your een upon the grass. She'll ne'er find what she seeks any more than the lost Largos out at the Dyke in the deep sea, or the gold that Tammas the Rhymer promised for the sho'lling in that very hill there when the trumpet should _aw at the foot, and the white bull roar on the tap. It"], [137, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner.\" 125 is very pitiful, but if it is a doom on the family you maun e'en dree it. Ye've been weel aff for the lave.\" Mrs. Hoy turned round with evident signs of indig nation on her calm face. \" How dare you speak of a doom, woman ? Isna it written that the Lord is merciful and gracious ? Didna He lend me my wee lassie when it was His will that my strong, happy Davie should flit from the Greenland fogs and the whale strokes to His blessed heaven ? In place of setting Himself to curse my lass, have we not His word that He is a Father to the fatherless, and a husband to the widow ? Tak your doom to yoursel', you faithless woman.\" Mrs. Hoy's words were powerful, because they were spoken in the spirit of Scripture. Elspa now experienced that sweet content which comes after violent tossing, as convalescence after fever. She could not afford to die. She was a Christian. She had been an idolater ; now she must learn to worship her God with her whole heart. Her old mother and her friends and acquaintances survived their loss, and she must deal faithfully by them as she would render her last account. So Elspa went back to her little household employments and enjoyments; sat at her spinning and her knitting, as of old ; took her share in the toil and the pleasure of the cow and the yaird, and revived her interest in the concerns of her neighbours. There was peace in the cottage again ; a sedate, lasting peace. Elspa looked much as she did before. It was true she was a little paler, a little sharper-featured, and with a certain indescribable matronly air, so that she was often"], [138, "126 Days of Yore. i mistaken for a matron, much to the amusement, as it might have been to the edification, of the young girls of Largo. Her mother no longer addressed her \u2014 \" Bairn, you'll gather wit.\" The wit was gathered and garnered, and its price was paid. Elspa, though still hearty, was as full of forethought and consideration and steady perseverance, as any \"goodwife of ten years standing.\" It was one of those stormy spring days, more trying on the coast than the frosts of winter \u2014 a day of keen gales and drifting sand and drenching spray, blighting all early promise. Two lone women like Elspa and her mother soon suppered their cow, closed their door, drew to the cosy fire, and sang a song of praise for their \"blazing ingle\" and their \" clean hearth stane.\" They fell to their work, and the cheery hum of the spinning wheel was heard, and mingled with it the click of the knitting-needles. The ripe experience of the elder as sorted well with the touching fulness and completeness of sympathy in the younger \u2014 touching because it blew unarrested, unimpeded, over a filled grave and a closed door, though there were no silver threads in the dark auburn hair, nor a perceptible hollowness in the tinted olive of the cheek. They were a pretty sight \u2014 that mother and daughter \u2014 a rare, congenial pair. They were well satisfied ; they would have said that they envied no one. They wished their poorer, improvident, unrighteous neighbours were \" even as they were,\" without the trials that disciplined"], [139, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner!' 127 them, and they would willingly have led them over the rough places before them. Through the angry hush of the waves a knock was heard at the door, an uncertain, muffled knock. They expected no one, and though they were hospitable, as the poorer classes are pre-eminently, Elspa's eyelids quivered, unconsciously asserting that the seclusion should not be invaded. Then she rebuked herself, stirred the fire, drew forward a chair and muttered \u2014 \" It is long past the guisards ; it must be some poor feckless body caught in the blast,\" and she moved with a light step to open the door. The door was in shadow, opening as it did on a landing. Elspa did not move the lamp, yet in a moment she uttered such a cry as the dead come to life again alone could excite; a cry that made Mrs. Hoy start, tremble, and turn white in her chair. The new comer flung down his own keen consciousness and quivering sensibility; he forgot his woes and his wants, and came forward to support Elspa in her reeling endurance. \" Elspa, poor lass, can you no stand the shock ? you'll soon comprehend it ; I was not certainly reported drowned or dead. Many a man has come back after years and years of toil. Elspa, are you no glad, or will you drop down dead at my feet ? \" Elspa heard that appeal. Was she glad then? It seemed as though the good on earth were changed into the good in heaven, as if indeed the meek were trans lated to their inheritance. They had been moving submissively among the stingless pains and cool, shaded pleasures of time, and anon they grasped bliss."], [140, "128 Days of Yore. How these women's faces lightened, how stirred they were, how they returned that night as to the wild ardour of youth and the vigorous activity of middle-life ! They took the heavy coat from the worn man and placed him in the elbow chair. They laughed and cried over him, and caressed him, fed his faintness, and had no words but \u2014 \" You've been long, long, Magnus ; we've watched and we've waited for you. We were to blame, lad, but we would have kept the truth to tell you, even in another world.\" Then, as if their joy were too much for their hearts, these self-contained women threw open their door, and hurried to raise their neighbours, to see for themselves that Magnus Guthrie had come home. Magnus related to a gaping congratulatory crowd how the \" Silver Trident \" had fared on her outward voyage ; how she had encountered much foul weather homeward bound ; how she had sprung a leak and lain a wreck, and her long boat had been swamped in the trough of the wave ; how her small boat, with its remnant of the crew, had beat the waters, through feartul days of starvation and exposure, till they were picked up by the \" Sally,\" which carried them half-way round the world again ere she was able to return them to Kirkaldy. But it was to Elspa alone, by the hearth, with his weary head on her loving shoulder, that Magnus whispered how he had been put ashore on account of illness, and had laid insensible in a Spanish hospital ; how an Englishman, or Scotchman, had visited the place, looked at him, as he was informed, in his stupor, and had placed on his pillow the ivory ring"], [141, "Shadow of the \"Ancient Mariner!' 129 of Elspa's rock, which he had bought for her long ago in the Prussian town. He had it with him, and could swear to it anywhere by the initials he had scratched within the rim. The sight of it in the other world enchained him. He knew it must have come from Sealchraig, but whether in mockery or in atonement he could not decide. It was at all events a magic ring, drawing him home to ascertain the truth, and had proved to him like the sacred ring of wedlock. And the pair could afford to forgive Sealchraig, and to speak gently of him. They fancied they would deal tenderly with him, and win him to be their friend, when he came back to Largo. But that day never dawned. Magnus was restored to yet higher rank and esteem than he had formerly held, in proportion to the hardships he had manfully weathered. Elspa, to her complete satis- faction, filled the \" bien house,\" with the clematis hedge and the crystal well, and Mrs. Hoy lived to nurse her grandchildren ; but Alexander Sealchraig came no more to Largo. Strange to the last, he had left behind him the gun, his inseparable weapon, \" the cedar kist,\" and the cocoa cup, with their invaluable memories and asso- ciations. He had taken Elspa Hoy's ivory ring, and he may have labelled it, \" Only the band of a woman's rock,\" though apparently he relented and transmitted it again to its owner by the man he had wronged. He never re appeared in his native place, never sent it fresh tidings oi his welfare, nor loomed anew upon it a meteor out of the darkness. \" He was never more heard of \" is the epitaph of the K"], [142, "Days of Yore. 130 great Largo mariner, and strangers still, if they choose, may pace his narrow beach, and ask themselves \u2014 \"Where does he find rest ? or does his stormy spirit, like that of another Wandering Jew's, walk up and down among the islands and wild sea straits which he peopled to the young imagination, thenceforth and for ever?\""], [143, "THE DAYS OF THE DUTCH FAIR. I. \u2014 THE EVE OF THE KERMIS \u2014 VERONICA AND MAURITZ. \" T MUST,\" sighs little Veronica, the daughter of Adrian Vanstraelen, on the eve of the great Kermis of Rotterdam ; but, while admitting the necessity, the rosy maiden's wicked fingers pluck into forlorn sprays the myrtle crown \u2014 about as lucky an act as to strip the blossoms from an orange-tree bough. It was on the eve of an important event and a fascina ting time. To-morrow would see the beginning of the great Kermis of Rotterdam \u2014 that centre of business and joviality \u2014 to which, for a whole year, since last celebra tion in good sooth ! the burghers and the peasant-girls for leagues round had looked longingly. It was in the good days of Holland's prosperity, ere yet England had outstripped her in commerce, and after her own greatest troubles were over. The red caps of the Hooks and the grey caps of the Kabbeljaws were doffed in peace ; the Gueux had cast aside their wallets and wooden drinking cups; and the Stadtholder was firmly established. The feuds between Calvinist and Arminian were quenched in K 2"], [144, "Days of Yore. 132 blood ; and the tulip mania had gone out in ashes. The sea-worms, the fearfulest enemy of all, had perished in the timely frost, and the spice trade, the China and Japan trades, and the Delft manufacture, were all flourish ing ; while the painters had won great names, and were beckoning their brother artists to follow in the peaceful path of their renown. There she lay \u2014 that paradox of a country \u2014 without hill or rock, yet very dear to the painter's heart. Our hankerings after her green sluggish canals, her Paul Potter cattle, her windmills, her masts of ships actually interlaced with branches of trees on her yellow brick quays, bear witness to this. Her portly \" purple-fleshed\" burghers, with their banner of trade, and their brave resistance to Alva and Louis XIV., have made a place in our hearts. Familiar to us are her women with their fair apple-blossom complexions, and luxuriant flaxen hair; their round softness in youth, and their solid square proportions in age ; their absence of all hair under their ugly linen caps, and their mottled cheeks as they fill the honoured grandmothers' chairs, and supply models to generations of painters for old women knitting, old women peeling onions, old women with spectacles and with hymn-books, such as, with song-books and Bibles, formed their libraries. There is a very fascina- tion in those old Dutch women, in spite of their over grown bulk and their wrinkled harshness of physiogomy. One loves their honest, sagacious, sometimes careworn faces. Yes, indeed, one hankers also after the drinkers of Teniers, the dashing riders of Wouvermans the boors'"], [145, "Days of t hie Dutc/i Pair. 133 wives and children of Van Ostade, simply because of their common humanity. That Holland of a century ago \u2014 made up of flats and dykes, floating vessels and stationary wooden houses, and with its blunt buyers and sellers \u2014 had its quaint, luxu rious, ineffable charm. Its Rotterdam, too, was unique, with its carved gables full five stories in height \u2014 beneath, great warehouses \u2014 above, flights of broad stairs and lofty doors opening into marble halls and spacious apartments, where were their looms, their egg-shell china, their Rubens, Jan Steen, or Cuyp, their ivory and japan work, their heavy silk and cobweb muslin. And beyond these again there were more private and cosy chambers, with Dutch tiles in their chimneys, curious clocks ticking warningly in the corner, and stands of balsams in the windows, from whence one could get a fair view into the green flutter of the mighty poplar trees, and even far on till you caught a glimpse of the snow-white sails of some track-boat swaying with the tide, towards the gaunt arms of a windmill, or the red brick \"Carillons,\" or the \"black Dutch steeples.\" That Rotterdam \u2014 like the women wash ing their hands in silver basins, the burly men with their open shirt necks, the cows placidly chewing their cuds at evening, in our galleries \u2014 was in its own way unequalled. And so was the bustle for the Kermis. The countrymen in buff hats were busy erecting the booths and deco rating them with flowers, under the shade of the trees ; low waggons drawn by great black horses, were rumbling along, laden with merchandise of all kinds ; the Fries landers and the women of Groningen, ruddy and robust,"], [146, "Days of Yore. 134 with their head-dresses of gold plates and rich lace, were laying out their wares, their lively tongues already scream ing with excitement. There were caravans with bears, tigers, monkeys, and parrots, whose owners quarrelled for precedence; rope-dancers raising their tents ; jugglers and buffoons already practising their legerdemain, and covering the bumpkins with ridicule ; and strangers from learned Leyden and the courtly Hague, from Utrecht and from Amsterdam, in a profusion of buckles and buttons, and in the long coats common to our ancestors, quietly surveying the scene, and doubtless making their own comments. The Kermis was a great affair in old Rotterdam. It was a great affair to Adrian Vanstraelen, as to other mer chants. Perhaps it was even a more important thing to Adrian than to others ; for the prosperity of his old house was somewhat on the wane, and it needed the anniversary to fill his warehouses with customers, and to bring his correspondents' vessels three abreast to his quay. Besides all which, Adrian had private views with regard to this Kermis, which rendered it of special interest to him and likely to be remembered throughout his life. They say there are two great types of Dutchmen \u2014 the lean, yellow, scheming, eager politician, always shaking his skinny forefinger, and advancing his long, self-con ceited head among the blue flasks and long glasses ; and the portly, solemn, sublime Dutchman, the indomitable, cool, unflinching doer. But Adrian Vanstraelen belonged to neither. He must have been a singular man ; for he represented a class who stand alone and individual, at"], [147, "Days of t lie Dutcli Fair. 135 once honoured and laughed at by their contemporaries, and spoken of as dreamers, and \"too good for this world.\" He had a \"giant forehead and child-like eyes.\" He was a profound man, yet a simple \u00a9ne, guileless to excess in his gruffness. He had conducted many a hazardous undertaking ; had proposed many a magnani mous scheme ; had been listened to, and followed half way, then forsaken, frowned at, and finally forgiven. As he had a large intellect, one might have fancied he could, on his own fair principles, have managed an extensive business, at once to his own advantage and the benefit of his neighbours; but unfortunately his talents were not well adapted to trade. He would have made a better painter, poet, professor, or divine. He was too ideal, generalized overmuch ; the hard-headed and hard-fisted got before him ; and the old house of Vanstraelen, which in its turn had employed Rembrandt, sent a cadet in the galliot with Van Tromp, and had owned lugger after lugger riding triumphantly in the Spanish main, was gradually dwindling to decay. Adrian was grieved to the heart. He had conscientiously adhered to the business, which had fallen to him by inheritance, and in following which he thought he could be most useful to to his country. He had sat in his office and stood on his quay perseveringly, denying himself commu nion with Nature, dear to him as to Paul Potter and Ruysdael themselves, and had thrown aside his sciences of government and theology, which had filled both brain tnd heart to no purpose \u2014 so far, at least, as the pros perity of his family was concerned."], [148, "Days of Yore. 136 Adrian had no son, and Veronica was his only child. He was resolved to marry Veronica so as to redeem his position in some degree. To marry the dear child honourably and lovingly, of course ; but still in such a way as to check the decline of the house, and infuse fresh strength and energy into it. Next to his duty to God, country, and child, was Adrian's duty to the house \u25a0 \u2014 the honourable, dignified house of Vanstraelen. It was easy to unite both interests. There were plenty of likely, worthy young fellows \u2014 scions of the old mercan tile families of Holland, just returned from the students' classes at Utrecht or Leyden, from a trip to Batavia, or better still, from a strict apprenticeship to commerce \u2014 who would be right willing to wed Veronica, combine forces, and so revive the spent activity of the past. Adrian Vanstraelen had even fixed upon his man, had exchanged credentials with his parents, and appointed the bridegroom to appear at the present Kermis. Very warmly did the old merchant desire the conclusion of the treaty. He had even arranged, that parties being agreed, the betrothal and the marriage should be celebrated simultaneously, before Herr Heemkirk returned to Delft. Herr Adrian had certainly not founded his choice upon prudential motives alone. Delft, great in pottery, and priding itself in the tombs of Father William and Grotius, was yet small among Dutch towns ; and Herr Heemkirk's father, though the owner of the greatest pottery, and a magnate in Delft, was only, after all, a moderate man in busy, ship-besieged Rotterdam. But Adrian had an old connection with the respectable family of Heemkirk."], [149, "Days of tlie Dutch Fair. 137 He had visited Delft in later years, and had taken a great fancy to young Mauritz Heemkirk, and was determined that he and no other should be the husband of his good roguish Veronica, always, however, anticipating her approbation and consent. Vanstraelen had no reason to doubt his daughter's docility. Dutch girls did not learn their catechism to so little purpose as to leave them utterly perverse and rebellious, although doubt- less they had their humours and fancies. Those Dutch maidens who dwelt in the Boomjees, and gazed dreamily down on the poplars and willows, the shipping and the canal, were very much like other damsels, else their apple-blossom complexions and forget-me-not eyes would have failed them as irresistible attractions. They must have had their passions, their struggles, their tragedies, and their comedies, too ; but they were conducted quietly and modestly, with a maidenly propriety that veiled all so prettily and pathetically \u2014 coy joy as well as heavy heart-break. Veronica had her full share of these feelings and fancies. But she was not exactly the representative of Dutch maidens, any more than her father was of Dutch men. She was Veronica Vanstraelen, and there could not perhaps have been found another of exactly similar character and tastes in the whole republic. Only in her beauty Veronica belonged to the highest Dutch type. She was fair and soft, with quantities of silken-flaxen hair, plaited into basket-work, and carried above and behind her little head ; her eyes were bluer than any thing on earth except the Mayence forget-me-not, and"], [150, "Days of Yore. 138 could only have been matched by the blue summer sky ; and she had cheeks so like the apple-blossom or those balsams she and her aunt Katrina were such adepts in rearing, that no mortal had ever seen anything else in the material universe so fresh and fair. A sea-shell was too delicate, a blush-rose too dim, a carnation too crimson in comparison ; and then her neck \u2014 there never was such a pillar of soft milky whiteness ! Veronica had been brought up a good deal alone as a girl. Without brother or sister, and with her mother in an early grave, her father and her Aunt Katrina had allowed her the free use of her faculties and imagination. She had been taught housekeeping and gardening in full measure, and had been thoroughly, seriously drilled in religious knowledge. As for reading beyond this, and writing, history, painting, and the harpsichord \u2014 these were given in limited doses. But notwithstanding this staid regimen, Veronica had as much romance in her heart as would be found in the wild, diamond-eyed Arab woman in her tent, or the meek, almond-eyed Indian woman in her wigwam ; only it had been tolerably bridled up by a grave, reverential Dutch training. She had her song-book and her Rhenish legends ; she had her tradi tions of brave, hardly-used Jacqueline of Holland and Hainault ; of the dames who sent their hearts afloat with De Ruyter ; of the ladies who remained widowed for the friends of the De Witts ; of the women, too, who smote the stony rock, and brought sobs and tears of penitence from the brutal buccaneers. And if these had failed, Veronica ivould still have kept hold of Rachel so sweet and beautiful,"], [151, "Days of the DutcJi Fair. 139 of poor Leah slighted and scorned, of Ruth claiming the regard of Boaz, and of stately Esther eliciting the love of lordly Ahasuerus. But Veronica, with her thoughtfulness, her romance, and her tempered blitheness, was dutiful to her father and dearly loved him, grieving with a girl's impulsive sorrow and apprehension at the stoop in his broad shoulders, the profuse silver gathering in his hair and beard ; and so she said, \" I must,\" though she would much rather have had it \" I must not.\" The heaviest demand that had yet been made upon her forbearance and gentleness was this matter of marrying Mauritz Heemkirk, and she sighed pettishly, and broke her myrtle crown. Veronica did not know Mauritz, save from hearsay. What tidings had reached her of the lad were far from favourable, except, of course, her father's evidence, which she could not in this case consider valuable. Veronica's cousin Hans was often in Delft, and his accounts were not by any means inspiriting. Hans, it was true, had himself been foolish, and had wished to marry Veronica at one time; but then he was fully aware that she was now irrevocably destined for another, and had no conceivable motive for traducing Mauritz. Veronica's friend, Jacqueline Netcher, had also visited Delft, and she had directed such stores of disparaging mockery against Herr Mauritz ! Jacqueline, it must be said, was always seeking admiration, and offended if she did not get it ; but then she knew perfectly well that the heir of the great pottery, the tulip gardens, the butter casks, the"], [152, "Days of Yore. 140 bales, the nut walk, the iris-coloured house, and the clipped box trees was months ago bespoken for Veronica Vanstraelen. Jacqueline's testimony was surely impartial, and could not be coloured in any way by mortification. A great, hulking Dutch youth, with a heavy countenance and an uncertain laugh, what were his pots, his tulips, his cheese, his box trees to Veronica ? What to her his re putation of being a good son, an obliging neighbour, a benevolent master, or a promising trader ? What even the conviction that when he did conquer his taciturnity he must have spoken to the point, to have so satisfied her gracious and gifted father of his mental and moral superiority ? They had sealed her fate. Had her father run mad and proposed to marry her to a wicked man or a downright fool, she might in conscience have resisted ; as it was, she could only prepare for this dull, sluggish, virtuous, and sensible Mauritz the Silent, wring her hands and cry \" I must.\" Those poor, good, patient women who wed at a lifted finger \u2014 those young German princesses who cross king doms to a stout meat-loving Jerome Buonaparte or a savage Czar of Muscovy \u2014 alas for their crushed wills, their writhing hearts ! Veronica, though a good child, was sensitive and im petuous, so that her lighter burden and easier fate did not much relieve her trouble. On the eve of this Kermis, she was no longer in a bevy of girls watching the crowds in the Boomjees, or selecting fairings ; no longer spinning in the little parlour or dishing those pink preserved pears for her father's supper ; no longer tying"], [153, "Days of the Dutc/i Fair. 141 up her roses in the garden, or painting in the summer- house, dressed in her brocaded skirt, her velvet bodice, her fringed boots, and her jewelled stomacher \u2014 she was seated with her hands crossed on her lap in miserable, nervous idleness. Beside her sat her father, in his super- fine broad cloth. He had just laid down his pipe and was walking up and down in the fever of expectant waiting ; while Aunt Katrina, in her rustling silk dress, was counting the dishes on her fingers and tacking the lace to the rich toilette cover in the spacious visitors' room, amidst th. old ancestral furniture and the unfading pictures. And for poor Veronica there was nothing but the reflection that throughout Rotterdam, in hall and cabinet, busy tongues would keep repeating, \" Poor Rika Vanstraelen ! she is to be presented to-night to her uncouth bridegroom ! What a trial for Rika ! How we pity her ! She was spoilt by her father and aunt, and so thought herself somebody; and now to be married off-hand to a mere trader and banished to the wooden houses and the ' storks of little Delft.' \" For it had been arranged that the couple were to reside at Delft to establish the great house of Vanstraelen there ; and that when Adrian him self should retire from the head house of Rotterdam, then they should return. Sometimes Veronica fancied she would die within the year, and thought how much her father and Aunt Katrina would mourn her. Her heart actually rose to her mouth as she suppressed her sobs when this possibility fixed itself in her imagination. At other times a wicked spirit would suggest as a relief that she should break a certain"], [154, "Days of Yore. 142 person's heart and cause him to desert or discard her, and so suffer her the sooner to return to her old father. The bells of the old steeple were now ringing the hour at which the Stellwagen rattled into the maket-place and the canal-boat was towed to the pier. Many joyous travellers would be leaping out ; many glad hearts would be awaiting them ; and all would be stir and blitheness in the city. It was hard that Veronica alone should feel sorrowful and reluctant. The child had never known any disappointment; she had never borne unpleasant shocks, or experienced cruel tests of her self-control. But there were steps on the stairs, and a grand commotion began. Adrian Vanstraelen turned eagerly to the door, Aunt Katrina winked and nodded her head, and poor Veronica shrunk into herself as a stranger stumbled into the room. Herr Mauritz had chosen to walk from the last village, and was consequently dusty and disordered in dress and air. In this state he was introduced into the merchant's mansion on the Boomjees. Perhaps he desired solitude and sought to escape observation ; and to gratify his young passion, or from an amiable fear that his feat might occasion disappointment, he had walked so fast as to exhaust himself, and hence the detriment to his personal appearance. But he was a great, overgrown boy ; in fact, a sloven of a man. He entered awkwardly, greeting them with considerable trepidation, and drawing back from saluting more than the tips of Veronica's fingers. Although Veronica was very wretched, she was the first to recover her presence of mind. She took careful"], [155, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 143 note of Mauritz, and had to confess to herself that he was an unready, unmannerly fellow. She tingled over occasionally with scornful laughter, even amidst a deep inclination to weep. She really could not repress a laugh at his offering a box of rare tulip roots to Aunt Katrina, of all persons in the world ! Such a gift for a bride groom, and so bestowed ! Veronica desired no costly bribe, no addition to her substantial, spendid bridal finery, in which she found quite insufficient consolation ; but here was another instance of Mauritz's oddity : for the Dutch, with their business habits, had, in their acquisition of French fashions, learned with peculiar facility the habit of giving massive and extensive corbeilles, including cloth and linen, furs and laces, watches and rings. And there was Herr Mauritz already reclining, cross legged, quiescent, in the corner of the window-seat, just as Hans had described him sitting before the stove in winter. He was listening to Adrian's cordial inquiries and wise remarks, occasionally casting towards him in return the merest monosyllables, and appearing indeed rather pensive than exhilarated. No marvel that Veronica was self-conscious and constrained, and did not utter one happy sentence, notwithstanding that the little girl usually commanded that crystal ripple of cheerfulness which often lights up a meditative nature. Herr Mauritz was solemnly devout at prayers : he ate perseveringly at supper; but Veronica saw no more of him. She asked her father's blessing, and retired as soon as she dared to that most spotless sanctuary, a Dutch maiden's bed-chamber. But some uncomely guests shared"], [156, "Days of Yore. 144 it with her that night \u2014 the hags, Disappointment and Chagrrn \u2014 whom she beat down and tried to shake off, but could not conquer. Ah ! Adrian Vanstraelen, your wise plans and good intentions have brought wild dis order into a gentle heart 1 II.\u2014 THE FIGHT WITH THE ZEALANDERS. Aunt Katrina thought Veronica a very lucky girl ; Mauritz was such a sober, thoughtful, worthy young man, and also well to do ! She had heard that Frau Heemkirk owned the deepest linen presses, and grew the finest balsams in Delft ; and Herr Mauritz was the eldest son ! And then Delft was so near, and yet not too near. Veronica might take the track-boat sometimes, though she need not for ever be running away from her darning and her baking. And such a quilt she had embroidered for Veronica, and so sweet were her muslins, and so stiff her silks 1 So sang the old lady ; but such songs will not always captivate young ears. Aunt Katrina was besotted, sitting there in her cape, with her tight lace cap peaked down on her wrinkled forehead ; actually thinking how well she would have liked to have been as luckily dis posed of in her youth, and dropping some gentle sighs of regret over the fate which had made her spend many weary lonely days managing her brother Adrian's house and trying to be a mother to his child. Adrian next morning sought a word with his daughter. He did not scold her, for he was always very tender and indulgent, without being in any way sentimental. His"], [157, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 145 sentences smacked rather of the rough humour which distinguishes the tone of many a genuine philanthropist. \" My child, it is right well that a maiden be modest before her bridegroom. But there is a medium; try and avoid extremes. A youth \u2014 an honest, deep, still youth \u2014 with something in him, and not an empty, chattering cox comb, needs some talk and encouragement. To be ' as mute as a fish,' reminds one that a fish is cold and slippery. I have passed my word, Veronica, and am not mocking my friend, or asking him to put up with less than his due, and this is a peculiar case. Heemkirk's son is not in short-sighted folks' eyes a match for Vanstraelen's daughter. But he is a worthy lad. So, although fishing is a refreshing pastime in this summer weather, and stewed fish is a savoury dish, do not, I pray you, my daughter, let us have too much of the association. If you love me, keep everything in its proper place and proportion.\" Veronica now felt the narrow ladder knocked from beneath her feet. She had dressed herself in her brocade and family stomacher, and had not taken any treacherous means to disfigure herself. She had not brought on a swollen face, or inflamed her eyes with forced tears ; with all a woman's inconsistency and improvidence, she had impolitically looked her best. But it must be confessed she had entertained a faint hope that Mauritz might haply find her even as waxen and matter-of-fact as his mother's balsams \u2014 too lifeless even for the wife of a Dutch trader ! And if she was thus to exert herself to entertain this Delft monster \u2014 ascertain his tastes and defer to his opinions \u2014 there was for her no hope, none in the world. L"], [158, "Days of Yore. 146 Oh ! if Herr Mauritz had but entertained some previous attachment, or inclined to incorrigible bachelorhood ! He was eccentric enough for the latter, but he had informed her father that there was no impediment what ever on his side, and that if inclinations served, he would be honoured in becoming his son-in-law. The moodiness and melancholy which she had detected in his counte nance on the preceding evening, she felt must be engrained in his temperament \u2014 another of his great attractions, though neither Hans nor Jacqueline had insisted upon it when they proclaimed his characteristics. At breakfast, Mauritz was certainly livelier than on the preceding night, but still he seemed only a tall raw youth, whose singularities were exaggerated by his French coat and three-cornered hat, which he carried in under his arm. His dress contrasted unfavourably with Adrian Vanstraelen's old Dutch costume \u2014 vo luminous vest of richest colours, breeches of sumptuous pile tied at the knee, and high fur cap \u2014 not by any means an unbecoming costume for a man of large bulk and stately presence. Mauritz's hair, or rather his wig, was combed back, and formed a cluster of fair curls on his back. The beard was still of so slight growth as to expose a ponderousness of temple and jaw; and Veronica in her rashness did not pause to reflect that the heaviness of face which she condemned, proceeded in great part from the very same massiveness of head she was wont to admire in her father. The suitor did not address Veronica very pointedly. but he talked pleasantly enough with Aunt Katrina."], [159, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 147 x* When Veronica, in compliance with her father's hint, and in answer to an appeal from his lovirg but resolute eye, forced herself to utter a few disjointed observations on the country, the Kermis, and other things, he turned quickly, and met her advances with sufficient grace and self-command. He remarked intelligently too on the pictures on the walls \u2014 the sea-fights, the family groups, the fruit pieces; but then he confessed that he had a dear friend in Herr Leuwenhock, the poor but rising painter. The girl could not continue to despise their guest, but it was sad enough to stop short only at contempt ! Veronica knew herself young, and instinctively felt that she was capable of high hopes and strong regards ; and after having been so many years Adrian Vanstraelen's darling, it was not easy to sink down contentedly into Mauritz Heemkirk's housewife. Indeed, a simple spectator might have sympathised and condoled with her ; \u2014 for the half loutish young man, so phlegmatic and sombre, and the little girl as charming as the morning in her chintz, her white cap, and her white linen gloves laid ready to her hand when she chose to go abroad, did seem a somewhat unnatural match. It was a relief when the clamour already rising from the Boomjees, and the urgent demands of business \u2014 for new customers were pouring in from all quarters of Holland \u2014 called away the gentlemen, and the women were left to their household engagements. Their contemplation of Veronica's stores of private property, their reception of fresh additions to her coffers, and their distant contem plation of the business and gaiety of the Kermis from the L 2"], [160, "148 Days of Yore. long windows, were a welcome change until such time as Veronica sallied out, properly attended, to make the crowning additions to her menage. These could only be obtained at the fair. They were homely articles, but noteworthy in a Dutch girl's estimation \u2014 cloth from Utrecht, damask linen from Germany, brooms from this village, cutlery from that town, nets from the coast, and wicker-work from the interior. Dutch women of their degree were not free to walk abroad in the Kermis with out a male escort. At a later period, indeed, it would not have been considered proper for a girl in Veronica's position to have shown herself in the throng at all; but at this time it was still quite decorous for such as her to countenance the country maidens and the peasant brides by affording them an example of forethought and discre tion in the selection she made of the homely furniture of her future domestic life, and by her special prudence and care in the heyday of her love, and youthfulness, and prosperity. Many a worn, grey-haired wife, clung fondly to the shabby old basket or dilapidated red umbrella, because she could say, \" I bought it at the Kermis before my marriage, when my father and mother first trusted me with a purse full of guilders, and Franz looked on and laughed to see every groschen laid out upon our house, because it convinced him of the reality of our going together.\" But poor Veronica by no means craved this rather ostentatious shopping. She was sick already of the Kermis \u2014 of its dust, its trundling wheels, its bawling, its gingerbread. She earnestly wished for the return of those"], [161, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 149 quiet days when the vessels glided past the huge willow tree, and one had time to view the watch-tower on the bridge, and the mighty piles and palisades stealing out of the amber haze of a morning, and sinking again into the dove's-neck hues ot evening. The quiet Dutch are apt to run into excess a little, at their annual fairs. Temperate men at these times drink more than Seltzer water, and the demure milkmaids bounce about with unlimited noise, enjoying the luxurious good cheer, amid crowds of acquaintances. There are abundant fun and mischief, and, though ordinarily good natured, Dutch fun is boisterous, rude, and tending to riot. On the first day of the Kermis, before the hour of noon, a fight suddenly broke out on the Boomjees, and hostile masses of Zealanders and Brabanters were strug gling and pushing here and there. They were shouting vociferously, mauling each other, dispersing unconcerned passengers, and bringing sailors leaping from the decks of their ships in their dusky red jerkins, and with the disagreeable association of cutlasses, to mingle in the melee. Aunt Katrina turned her back on the discord. The boors should not be encouraged, she said ; she might see something to shock her. She preferred looking out her plasters to distribute through a steady warehouseman. Aunt Katrina must have put considerable check on her inclinations, for the tendency to look with excited eyes \u00bbn strife of every kind \u2014 from the struggles of a horseman to the progress of a blazing building or a water-logged boat \u2014 is a feature of the feminine character. The buxom"], [162, "Days of Yore. 150 maids of the establishment, in their coarse lace caps, their striped petticoats, and purple or yellow stockings, darted to the windows, doors, and balconies; while Veronica stood fixed between the floating curtains which fell around her like a nun's veil, and gazed down on the coarse violence in the streets. Suddenly an exclamation burst from Veronica's lips. There, in the tumult, was young Mauritz Heemkirk, dealing blows with the others, and attempting to wrest knives and sticks out of the hands of his opponents. Veronica could scarcely believe her eyes. But it was certainly her bridegroom, and he seemed to have a sense of her proximity too, for he looked hurriedly up in the midst of his struggles, while she had but a moment to draw back and avoid meeting his eye, ere he set-to again with redoubled fury. Veronica was perfectly thunder struck. What could he possibly have to do with such a brawl? He scarcely appeared the same man as she had seen before. And what should she now make of her discovery ? Ought she to announce his trouble, to the horror of Aunt Katrina ? or should she despatch to hi? aid a household brigade, in the shape of the maids and old Peter, the trusty warehouseman, the only persons available, the others being at the booths where Adrian Vanstraelen, as well as smaller men, displayed his wares ? or should she send a messenger by a back way to find and apprise her father ? or throw forward a scout to look out for the soldiers, and incur the responsibility of hurrying their attendance in the names of the Honourable Adrian Vanstraelen and his son-in-law elect ?"], [163, "Days of the Dutch Fair 151 Was the youth in danger ? A year later, had Veronica seen him in such a scene, she would have shrieked and rushed out on the pavement, and, pushing her way to the combatants, would have clasped his knees as she had seen wives hang upon men who had fallen from scaffold ings, or who had been torn from shedding each other's life-blood. But deadly blows were now being dealt, fitted to fire Veronica's heart. How Mauritz's chest swelled, and his blue eyes gleamed ! What a strong, fierce young man ! Here he gave a stroke which sent a brawny Islander spinning to the roots of the poplar trees, nigh the edge of the canal ; there he reeled against the shock of a double rush from two Flushing smugglers. He did not look up to Veronica again, and forgot to make for the merchant's house. Veronica saw that at the head of a party of Brabanters he still fought honestly and doggedly. He had no mind to solicit help ; he had got into the spirit of the encounter, and was waxing dan gerous. Veronica was startled to find herself actually admiring him, comparing him to father William coming to deliver them from Alva \u2014 to Van der Werf offering his body to his wolf-eyed townsmen sooner than yield Leyden to the Spaniard. Ah ! that was a murderous, teacherous back-thrust ! Veronica could contain herself no longer, but screamed aloud, and bent forward from the open window and cried cut, \"Mauritz, beware! save thyself!\" He was not hurt, and at that very moment a company of Dutch soldiers in the blue and red uniform \u2014 so often repre sensed in leaden and wooden models an inch long, that"], [164, "Days of Yore. 152 the very originals themselves have a certain leaden and wooden air \u2014 tramped into the Boomjees, while Veronica, covered with confusion and trepidation, sprang back and flung herself into her grandmother's chair. Presently all the women in the house were round her, uttering excla mations, seeking explanations, till they were dispersed suddenly by Adrian entering the hall, and talking to a companion all the way up stairs \u2014 \" My dear son, you must take the world more quietly ; true, it was quite shameful, the Zealander was seizing a villainous advan tage, and the poor little Brabanter was\" being robbed of his rights. I allow it was hard for an honest man of any spirit to stand aside and witness it, or to pass by and connive at it : but you must be more of a philosopher, like me. What ? I would have done the same at your age ? Nay, nay ! If the military had not come up just at the moment they did, your bones would have been broken. What ? it would not have signified ? Ask Veronica about that ; the good folks of Rotterdam will hold you a fire-eater hereafter, in place of a worthy shop keeper.\" So Herr Adrian lectured Mauritz, half lightly, half seriously, with a strong dash of banter, and a lurking tinge of sympathy, at which a formalist would not have been much pleased. But Mauritz Heemkirk, in spite of the words muttered in his own defence, looked quite crest-fallen under the moderate censure. Veronica had been terrified lest her voice had reached him ; but when she got a glimpse of the Delfter hanging his head so pitifully, his coat torn and splashed, and his cocked hat all over with mud she"], [165, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 1 5 3 felt relieved, and plucked up spirit enough to sa)-, \"Oh ! Herr Mauritz, your curls have certainly been caught among the green boughs,\" and then ran off to her own room. She had been diverted by this interlude. She was disappointed, however, to find that Herr Mauritz did not improve after it. It seemed to exhaust him for the day \u2014 so shy and awkward was he. The Vanstraelens had country relations arriving to take up quarters with them for the Kermis. They had deferred their arrival in consideration of the interest and importance of the previous evening, and had naively determined to take full benefit, not only of the Kermis, but also of the approaching marriage. Some men do not shine among those to whom they were recently strangers, and among whom they are suddenly elevated to import ance. The more those close around them, they shrink back ; the more they press them, the more they retire. Dutch William, Father William's true descendant, was not reckoned a hero when he first descended on England \u25a0 \u2014 indeed is scarce yet a hero with the attitudinizers, and speech-makers, and lovers of the boards. Mauritz made no progress with the country friends o. his bride ; but women are better dispensers of courtesy than men. Veronica was showing her country friends her trays of stockings, and piles of linen, dimity, and lace, and wiping away the heavy tears in her blue eyes, while Mauritz got absorbed and blundered, and never even offered to assist them to the sweet cake which she had worn herself into a state of nervousness with preparing. Veronica really could not put up with him. Why was he"], [166, "Days of Yore. 154 not contradictory and aggressive, as he had shown him self in the streets ? She could have borne that better. Was it to be her fate to die of inanition ? A great writer, of whom Veronica could not have heard, sets down a bridegroom's worst offence as being not barbarity, nor brutality, but the entirely negative disqualification : \u2014 \u25a0 \" The bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume.\" Veronica did not know the words, but she experienced the sense of them, and she retreated to her spotless chamber under a renewed harvest of chagrin. III. THE WIDOW'S STEWARD. The second day, Mauritz Heemkirk did not appear at the Vanstraelens' fragrant breakfast-table. While the guests stirred their steaming coffee, and stroked their beards, and looked curiously at Veronica, who blushed with mingled shame and vexation, as she sat in her morning gown of nankin, whose soft, buff colour would have suited no complexion but that of a warm brunette, or a balsam-cheeked Hollander, a note was delivered to Herr Adrian. He read, frowned a little, and, as he was a frank man amongst his own friends, he broke out a little pettishly, \" Now, this is too much of my honourable son-in-law ! Yes, yes, feed the widow, and clothe her too if you like, but also mind your own business ;\" and Adrian here glanced from out below his brown eyebrows at his daughter. \" Make your excellent father's pur-"], [167, "Days of t hie Dutcli Fair. 155 chases, for which you have little enough time ; learn the details of my connection (the \"S -nstraelen interests were not wont to be easily mastered \u2014 I once found them more difficult than mastering Latin under my beloved Professor Moglius, that, however, is neither here nor there) \u2014 but why make thyself a sign-post and gazing-stock to their high mightinesses of Rotterdam?\" Adrian Vanstraelen was a noble, an admirable man ; but he had his weaknesses and his prejudices. He was inclined to maintain the honours of Vanstraelen at a great expense. He was unwilling to compromise himself with those who ranked far below him in the aristocracy of virtue and intellect by anything beyond the pale of caste and custom ; he was a trader of Rotterdam, and loved what savoured of magnificence. Mauritz had broken bounds yesterday, but that might pass as a young man's frolic. That was the ebullition of an honour able man in a just cause; and though, by some, such generosity might be mistaken for senseless riot, insane arrogance, licentious vagabondism, he was not inclined to deal too severely with it. But to-day, when Mauritz was found sitting in the crockery booth of widow Prinzer \u25a0 \u2014 who had been disappointed in an agent to undertake her sale, and who would be ruined if there were any mistake or misconduct in the final disposal of her late husband's property \u2014 there could be no doubt that the young man was performing a charitable act. Nor did he scorn to discharge the trust with his own hands \u2014 for the care of this finest lot of Dutch china, copied from price less Eastern jars, or the original designs of great artists,"], [168, "156 Days of Yore. was, like the transfer of the finest roots of tulips during the mania, a very responsible business. \"Very benevolent,\" said the country friends, \"and very disinterested ; but a Delfter has, doubtless, a pecu liar interest in crockery.\" A little sneer accompanied this speech, for of course the agriculturists, the rape growers, and the tile-venders were jealous of Adrian Vanstraelen's throwing away his daughter on a potter, and finding no more suitable match nearer home. But Adrian was soon pacified. His heart easily warmed to kindness and condescension. By the shades of Erasmus, Barneveldt, and Father William himself, he would visit Mauritz at his counter, and before the haughtiest merchant in Rotterdam who disposed of his merchandise in ship loads and closed his fist to the famishing poor, he would beat down a mug for Rika. Veronica did not very well know how to regard this proceeding of Mauritz. It was odd, but then it was independent ; and she would have fancied him shrinking from notoriety and melting away, poor bashful creature, under its penalty. Cousin Hans and Jacqueline Netscher would jeer at him, of course. They had called and asked her if Herr Heemkirk was going to set up business for himself in Rotterdam, or if he was only engaged in a speculation to last the Kermis? They even asked why it was not a shooting gallery, or a hunt for shoes, or a contest for spiced cake that he had commenced with ? Then, to ue sure, Veronica held up her head and an swered, like a true girl, that Herr Mauritz was redeeming a friend from loss, working for a poor woman, and pre-"], [169, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 157 venting knavery. It was not every one who would bestow time and attention on such a matter. Yes, it was true Heir Mauritz was singular, but she hoped they would excuse his ways, and not decline to meet him at the great gathering of her friends in the evening. And yet all the time the little hypocrite Veronica was under the most dastardly apprehension about the poor figure Mauritz Heemkirk would cut in their company, and bemoaned her father's resolution, and the hard necessity which connected her with so dull and shabby a bridegroom. They did Veronica good, those gossips \u2014 Hans with his audacious attempt to resume old cousinly familiarities, Jacqueline with her cool overtures to be admitted to her confidence. Veronica was determined to judge for her self. She would see the spectacle which had made so many in the Kermis shrug their shoulders and ask how Adrian Vanstraelen could possibly have picked up for son-in-law a madder enthusiast than himself, and even speculate how many bills the Herr Assessor would give on the extinction of the time-honoured firm of Van straelen before the close of the century. Veronica persuaded her father that some of the broom venders and knife-grinders and mat-weavers, whom it was incumbent on her to patronise, would not wait for the end of the Kermis, but would decamp as soon as their commodities were disposed of. So she would not wait for Herr Mauritz, but sally out under the protection of her father and Aunt Katrina, with the female cousins in her train, and execute her commissions in the Kermis without loss of time."], [170, "158 Days of Yore. In truth, Adrian was only too glad to see Veronica once more show a little animation and wilfulness in her arrangements, and spontaneously do something which looked like furthering the wish of his heart \u2014 her union with Mauritz Heemkirk. So out they went, into the thunder of the Kermis. The town was actually getting tipsy, and behaving as if, like the valetudinarians of the day, it needed to be bled once a year, to be relieved of its plethoric gravity and sobriety, in order to keep it in healthy condition. Booths stood everywhere decorated with green boughs and branches of guilder roses ; with Dutch-like posies of peonies and tulips, purple and white, cream-coloured and crimson, straw-coloured and burnt umber ; as well as with bachelors' buttons, streaming ribbons, and gilded pinna cles and balls. Customers and pleasure-seekers in thou sands thronged the streets, in every variety of costume gazing on the display. There were long vests and doublets ; boots for the marshes, reaching to the knee ; rich fur-lined mantles ; broad belts with gleaming buckles, studded with Amsterdam cut diamonds, like the stones in Veronica's stomacher ; queer little straw cauls, like the linen cauls of the old women ; ruddy gold earrings, like those which Eleazar of Damascus laid with the bracelet in Rebekah's tawny hand ; cardinal's stockings, and great shady hats like that under which Rubens painted his wife. There were goods of every description \u2014 white rice, russet rye, blue raisins, green figs, and glittering herrings caught on the Doggerbank, where less quiet deeds than fishing were wont to be done. Flanders cloth, and French silk"], [171, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 159 were here also, and spices from other swamps than the cold flats of Holland \u2014 swamps where the bamboo withers in the deadly breath of the Upas tree. There were little birds of paradise with tiny bodies and tails like the plumes of angels, gaudy popinjays, mocking monkeys (for the Dutch ladies had their pets and plagues as well as their neighbours) ; horses of heavy make, and fleet jennets, tokens of the Spanish yoke, and sleek hounds ready for the chase in the green glades of the Bosch, which stretched away around Leyden, and which Wouvermans and Sneyders frequented. There was even a stall of Bibles \u2014 Bibles which formed the favourite sign of the inns, along with angels and some member of the house of Father William \u2014 Bibles vast in size, colossal in type, and in costly binding, according to native fancy. There were the usual amusements, not very improving, but excelling by reason of their buoyancy and boisterous ness. Boys cast knives at soft cakes, and some people engaged in the fine family game \u2014 a species of innocent rouge-et-noir \u2014 which consisted in rolling a ball till it stopped on a certain number, the prize being as many Dutch dolls, baby-houses, or butter-slices, as the figure on the square warranted. In spite of the frowning pastors, there was plenty of more objectionable gambling, such as emptied the pockets of Oliver Goldsmith, when he was student at Leyden. But Vanstraelen and his party were not idle gadabouts or spendthrifts. Adrian and Veronica, shielded in her Ruben's wife's hat, and holding fast to her father's arm, along with Aunt"], [172, "160 Days of Yore. Katrina and the cousins in their mantles and veils, passed along greeting their friends and nodding to humbla acquaintances. They were hailed with acclamation, because they were meeting the old City requirement of propriety and notability \u2014 the heiress of Fraulein Vans traelen completing her paraphernalia at the Kermis, thriftily and skilfully, like less-portioned brides. Some stranger, catching the murmur, supposed one of the country cousins to be the bride : Veronica was only too glad to find a substitute, and so Roschen Baumgarten was highly gratified to trip and beck and titter with the abdicated sceptre. Adrian would buy a Bible for his daughter. Veronica trembled a little at the purchase. She felt that when her own name and Mauritz Heemkirk's were written on the fly-leaf, it would be as good as the wedding-vow pro nounced between them. She knew she was captious and bold, but she constantly asked herself the question, Whether a Dutch maiden should seek aught else than a God-fearing, upright young man, whom her father ap proved, as her shield, her right hand and head ? To this the girl's nature answered No. She peered inquisitively in the direction of the crockery stalls, and yonder to be sure, sat Herr Mauritz, surrounded by pipkins, teapots, and scaramouches, and pagodas, and looking wonderfully at his ease, directing satellites, satisfying purchasers, taking in payment, and recording sales. Come hither, young maidens, who would only see your wooers among knights tilting in tournaments, among"], [173, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 161 poets penning sonnets, or reformers by one flourish healing the sores of humanity ! Look you, there sits big boned, ruddy Mauritz Heemkirk, executing a piece of trader's benevolence, lofty enough, perhaps, to rank as a duty, though even Adrian Vanstraelen doubts whether it may not demean him. Still it unquestionably betokens a certain manliness and great self-respect. Mauritz is not blundering, hesitating, or halting now. He is erect, decided, rapid, as well as patient and painstaking. Dutch William was not stiff when, amid the roar of cannon, he turned three regiments, and led them against the intole rance and bigotry of Louis le Grand. Mauritz has just disposed of an article for the owner at the full rate, and he smiles a broad, bright smile. A painter cleverly takes his likeness as he presides among warehousemen and clerks in his cauliflower curls and embroidered coat, and dubs it \" Dutch eagerness in the career of barter.\" Mauritz observes this, notices the grin of the beholders, catches at the sketch, and scrutinizes it ; and with a mellow laugh mantling over his face, he returns it politely to the artist. There are situations in which a man can well afford to be caricatured. Mauritz is not embarrassed even when his bride and her party bear down upon him. After all, Adrian Vanstraelen is not ashamed of the equivocal occupation of his son-in-law, but begins to relish it and feel a pride in it. Mauritz receives them all cheer fully, and is anxious to display to them those quaint, brilliant Sevres-like panels \u2014 a groundwork of delicate lilac or soft blue, the centre space brushed clear and glowing with luscious fruit, radiant flowers, or trim and M"], [174, "162 Days of Yore. gallant figures devised by a Dutchman. Truly beyor. I the turmoil of this Rotterdam lies the green, cultivated, lazy country, with many a pencil labouring to reproduce its richness and repose ; and among those Dutch burgo masters and boors, their wives and daughters, and old fashioned children, rises many a head, instinct with rare sagacity and tenderness. And indeed, one need not fear to assert that under the precise domesticity, industry, and placidity of this trading Dutch land there exists many a phase of genial picturesqueness and chivalry. Mauritz is confused only when Adrian Vanstraelen prices an exquisite sweetpot for his daughter. Mauritz had laid it aside; he purposed himself to purchase it, and to present it \u2014 to Aunt Katrina ! Adrian laughs a loud laugh \u2014 \"My lad, the old house in the Boomjees is crammed with furniture and toys; if you cannot venture on handing your fairings to friends more needing, then buy them for yourself, Mauritz, buy them for your own cabinets ; \" and he contents himself with taking the plainest apple-dish for Veronica. Aunt Katrina insists on curtseying, and expressing her pleasure and surprise at the young gentleman's considerate atten tions. Possibly there w-as no insincerity in Mauritz's mindfulness. Boaz loaded Ruth with the measures of barley for Naomi ; and it was sung of a hapless Scotch youth, that\u2014 \" lie courted the eldest with glove and with ring, Binorie, O Binorie ! But he lo'ed the youngest aboon a' thing, By the bonnie mill dams o' Binorie.\""], [175, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 163 Perhaps Mauritz was more delicate than deceitful, only he was unhappy in his interpreter. There they stood, that significant group, by the booth in the Kermis of Rotterdam ; and if the painter, who frittered away his talents on caricatures, had but limned them faithfully \u2014 the corpulent, comely, rejoicing father, the happy friends, the coy bride, and the modest bride groom looking not unlike the industrious apprentice of William Hogarth \u2014 certes, they would not have needed another chronicler. Veronica had attained her end, and she was satisfied. She was not impatient, though Herr Mauritz was so long detained that her guests were assembled before the bride groom had completed his toilette and made his entry. She did not find fault with his cravat or his cuffs, nor was she now distressed by the imagined criticisms of Cousin Hans and the commiseration of Jacqueline Netscher. She went up to him sweetly as he stood alone by the cold stove and said \u2014 \" Herr Mauritz, I fear your coffee is cold. What biscuits shall I bring you ? Are you not very tired?\" He looked down upon her with his blue eyes opening wide and kindling, and just then his expression changed, and he appeared once more the young man who fought the braggart Zealanders, and who took his place among the boothkeepers of the Kermis, cool, dignified, and confident, to save another's credit and redeem another's forlorn estate. And the maiden shrank back with droop ing eyelids and flushing cheeks ; but not in pain\u2014 a strange softness melted her, and a flash of new joy tingled through every vein. M 2"], [176, "Days of Yore. 164 The company were rather formal at their entertainment, and indulged in perpetual refreshments. They doubtless indulged pleasant anticipations of the magnificent supper, the quaint pies dressed like birds, the rich game, the fresh salads, and the luscious preserves, coupled with libations that left ample room for the wish \u2014 0* \" Oh ! that a Dutchman's soul could be Wide as the foaming Zuyder See.\" One feat was characteristic of the burly Dutch and the brusqueness of their glee. A horn so constructed as to produce a noise like thunder, was suddenly sounded by one of the guests. The ladies screamed and covered their ears, and some gentlemen engaged in conversation leapt two or three feet asunder. Herr Mauritz laughed like the rest of the men, but lounged in the back rows without volunteering a second experiment on the nerves of the circle. A merchant slightly acquainted with the envied bridegroom, suggested \" that Herr Mauritz should sound the hunter's call, as he could well do it, and that this was something worth risking one's tympanum for. \" But Herr Mauritz seemed deaf, until Veronica took it into her head that he turned his blue eyes to see whether she would second the request. She could only stammer \" Will you ? \" and almost before the words had passed her lips, Mauritz came forward with alacrity, and caught the horn. The first blast Herr Mauritz blew so distanced the other that it sounded as if it would blow off the roof. He could only laugh at their trepidation. But he atoned"], [177, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 165 for his barbarity, when, leaning out of the window over the Boomjees, he sent the reverberation among the yellowing poplars and over the mist-laden canal, and wound the various harmonies so richly, and with such mastery of strength and witchery of tunefulness, that if those present were not reminded of the honejxomb in Samson's dead lion, they must have been dolts indeed. The peasants, mechanics, and sailors, who with their wives and sweethearts were still holding the Kermis under a low moon and colotrred lamps hung out among the tall masts and the swaying branches, forsook their own fiddles and tambourines, and hurried in flocks to the neighbourhood. Veronica sat mute. It would have been hard to read the maiden's meditations. They were so profound as to prevent her joining in the applause and thanks ; and indeed, if truth must be said, Mauritz could not have missed her voice, for he was called out again on the concerns of that unconscionable Delft widow. When Mauritz returned, Veronica did not observe him for some time, notwithstanding his great stature. She was so occupied and agitated, that she failed even to notice her bridegroom. And yet she was not unhappy. She was carried away by the altered atmosphere of the evening, until she noticed that Mauritz had relapsed into the heavy dull boy of her first acquaintance. He had been walking up and down with Cousin Hans and sitting by Jacqueline Netscher, and his time for giving and receiving pleasure seemed over. He did not seek his bride, he did not warm up with the festivities, he merely"], [178, "Days of Yore. 166 bent his head, and left Adrian Vanstraelen to reply to the health-drinking. He drummed with his fingers on the table as if his mind wandered ; he sank his head on his breast as if he were about to drop asleep. Think, Veronica, how slumbrous was the air of that sea-lion, buried yonder at Delft in a hero's tomb, who nailed the broom to his mast, and swept the English Channel ! Remember, too, the plain leathern doublet still shown at the Hague, in which Father William was shot down ! Instead, Veronica protested. Jacqueline was openly satirical, and other friends followed her example with scarcely veiled innuendoes, in the way of congratulations on her promotion to the keys worn at the girdle in token of matronly rights, or condolences on her approaching departure from Rotterdam for Delft. It was too vexatious. Veronica rubbed her eyes. What could have come over Mauritz ? Which of the two was the real man ? Her perplexity was great. It was as if Beauty's Beast had given her some glimmering picture of a beautiful Prince, but kept her in a tantalizing uncertainty \u2014 now putting out a shapely gauntletted hand, and then a hairy paw, anon presenting a cap and feather, and again elevating a pair of furry ears. IV. THE MORNING IN THE STABTHAUS. The next morning there was no room for observation on Mauritz Heemkirk, nor need to marvel at the infatua tion which prompted Adrian Vanstraelen to select the"], [179, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 167 apathetic Delfter for his son-in-law, as being endowed with full powers to wreath with fresh laurels the hoary house of Vanstraelen. A common grievance, a subject of general interest, had withdrawn all attention from the couple Nobody, not even Adrian Vanstraelen, minded them on this disturbed morning. The Kermis was in an uproar \u2014 the traders of Rotterdam were divided, the burghers of Amsterdam, Gouda, Haarlem, and Delft were furious. The burgo masters sitting in the Stadthaus had all but decided an order which would hamper all foreign speculation in the Rotterdam Kermis. The consequences of this measure, like the suicidal consequences of all selfish measures, would in the end react on its founders, lop off the profits of the crusty or crafty Rotterdam burgomaster., and diminish their great annual fair to a mere name. Rotter dam was half taken-in with plausible promises ; even the enlarged wariness and wisdom of men nurtured in world wide commerce, only half doubted these. The aliens were all bristling in opposition, and almost threatening to break out in open violence. Adrian Vanstraelen, always on the side of liberal policy and freedom, was deeply mortified at the purpose of his countrymen. A whisper of the intention had circulated without receiving much credit, but now there was no doubt the danger was imminent, and the only question now was, what steps could be taken to oppose the pro clamation, which would cast disgrace on the capital, and seriously injure her dependencies. It was a desperate case. The Council consisted of"], [180, "168 Days of Yore. magnates with whom His Highness of Orange did not care to interfere, so that his consent was almost certain. An attempt to thwart them might be construed into resistance of their lawful authority, and visited with traders' vengeance. Adrian Vanstraelen himself attempted an opposition, but his intervention was peremptorily and clamorously repudiated. He was regarded as being all very well in a case of public charity or patriotism ; but in an instance of mercantile prudence to be suspected of anything trans cendant or quixotic, was certain death to the cause. \" I will carry the remonstrance,\" said the young Delfter, and he does not even so much as suggest the question of the old Roman : \u2014 \" Who will stand on my right hand ?\" The throng of Rotterdam friends and aggrieved foreigners who burst into Adrian Vanstraelen's break fast-room that morning, wholly overwhelming the small private concern of the bridal, stared in mingled indigna tion and ridicule at his interloper, this forward fellow who had the audacity to propose himself for such great responsibility as being messenger to the Stadthaus. \"My son, you are too young, you are not known yet; you must reserve yourself for another day,\" said Adrian gently, and thoughtfully scrutinising the eager face of the young man, while Veronica also gazed at him wist fully, with intent, inquiring looks. \" But, father,\" pleaded Mauritz, in his anxiety using filial privileges for the first time, \" if I am young, they"], [181, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 169 will grant me the more license; if I am unknown they will bear me no grudge.\" \" Mauritz, I am in some measure answerable to your father for your well-being ; Herr Heemkirk will not thank me for ruining his son.\" \" Nay,\" protested the young __an with increased deci sion, \"do you think he would spare me in such a cause ? Beware, Herr Vanstraelen, lest the world say you spare yourself, your own prosperity, in my person.\" What ! the world speak of the quiescence of a beard less, blunt young Delfter ! What an absurdity ! But Adrian Vanstraelen lent himself to it at last with vehemence, and said, \" Well, my friends, what do you say ? will you trust my son ? \" and as he spoke he clapped his hand proudly on the youth's shoulder. What was still more wonderful, the combined band of citizens and borderers were brought to consent to accept Mauritz as their delegate. No one else was so fool hardy, or no other person possessed the negative virtues which he had pointed out to them. Dubiously, reluctandy, half-despairingly, and after innumerable cautions, charges, restrictions and demurs had been tendered, the haters of monopoly rose in a body, and as there was not a moment to be lost, they prepared to marshal their scapegoat \u2014 this young bell-the-cat \u2014 through the streets, it being expected that the company would gradually gather like a driven snow-ball all the way to the Stadthaus. These men were wholly oblivious of little Veronica. Even Mauritz himself had at the moment but a dull sense of her rights. He half turned towards her, however, and"], [182, "Days of Yore. 170 looking back, whispered, \"Veronica Vanstraelen will wish her father's cause success, and will forgive the faults of its advocate ;\" and with a grave look and a half smile he was gone. Again Veronica had some severe thoughts of Mauritz. In her heart she accused him of stoicism and sternness. He would never make a tender husband. He might be a devoted servant of the Republic ; he would no doubt be regarded as Adrian Vanstraelen's noble son, her father having doubtless chosen well for the salvation of the house of Vanstraelen. But Mauritz Heemkirk would be no loving husband to her, or he would not become her husband at all. She had mistaken him last night, she had been mistaken in him all along. Aunt Katrina had been maundering in her own way, \" It is all very fine, Rika, for your father seems pleased. I dare say the burgomasters will confer some honour on Mauritz. But, in my young days, a bridegroom was more taken up with his bride, was consulting and courting her, in place of appearing before the Stadthaus. Why a bridegroom would no more have been called out upon public duty than they would have drawn a soldier from a house where a new-born child was cradled.\" \" Aunt Katrina, I wonder you can be so ungrateful,\" protested Veronica; \"think of your china jar and your tulips.\" She might have added with tears in her laughing eyes, \" Oh ! Aunt Katrina, you are paining me so that no plaster could ease the smart.\" But Adrian Vanstraelen came back to his daughter, looking resolute indeed, but with a touch of sorrow, like"], [183, "Days of thie Dutch Fair. 171 a man whose mind is made up to a great enterprise. \" I have accepted Mauritz,\" he said, while he stroked his daughter's flaxen hair as she bent over her needlework ; \" the party has accepted Mauritz ; the young man would not be refused. But, my child, I am sorry that the cacrifice should touch you \u2014 that you should share in airy part of the sacrifice.\" \" Father, this Mauritz would not be held back by me. I might as well try to restrain a lion with a silken cord ; and, you know, I would not spoil a hero,\" declared Veronica, with proud reserve. \" But if you would please me, pray let me walk with Peter to Marie Bergmann's, that I may witness the audience in her glass.\" Adrian consented willingly. \"You will see, Veronica, what a partner I have provided for you.\" Veronica looked at him keenly. \" Does he reject me, father?\" \" Child, what are you thinking of? He is a good youth, and I warrant him true as steel. But if the negotiation fails, as it may well do, he will be a sorry husband for thee. Not that I would dismiss him, never ; but notwithstanding all that he urged, I am not sure but that Herr Heemkirk will blame me very much. He is an excellent little man himself, but his head is always full of mountains and shiploads of crockery. He does not see so far as Herr Mauritz, and as is but too common with the biped man, his eyes are prone to be turned downwards,\" groaned Adrian. \"And such a tulip garden, Rika ! like a rainbow ; indeed, a house like a rainbow, all painted in red, lilac, yellow, and green, with boxtrees"], [184, "Days of Yore. 172 centuries old cut into peacocks, v..:ose tar_ rise like fans far above the summer-seats.

Will he be censured or discarded?\" \" Heaven forbid, Veronica ! \" exclaimed Adrian fer vently, \" all may turn out well. And keep you close to Peter, child, for the first days of the Kermis were nothing to what the press and tumult to get near the trial will be.\" Veronica put on her great mantle and one of her aunt's caps, which towered up in the crown, and, un like the usual skull cap, had so many puckerings and frillings drawn round the face and gathered above the forehead, that her features were quite hidden. So she pushed her way by back streets, under the protecting flourish of Peter's potent cudgel, to Marie Bergmann's house, opposite the Stadthaus, before which a great multi tude was already assembled. Marie Bergmann was a poor kinswoman, supported by the Vanstraelens. She was one of those who pay the compliment of never so much as even making a profes sion of gratitude for friendly support. Poor Marie was infirm in mind and body. The flavour of her coffee, the pungency of her snuff, and the direction of the wind were the only things which affected her at all in a lively manner. She was so indifferent and stolid, that she did not even speculate as to how Veronica Vanstraelen found"], [185, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 173 time to visit her during the Kermis, or whether she had brought her a fairing. Veronica sat on the stool at Marie Bergmann's window, gazing into the glass, which, fastened on the shutter, affords many a Dutch woman the opportunity of scrutini sing a line of shops or passengers, while she sits stitching at her embroidery-frame, weaving at her loom or dandling her baby. Occasionally Marie, from her big chair, sent peevish complaints about things of no interest save to herself. Mauritz and his sponsors elbowed their way to the Stadthaus ; the latter gesticulating and haranguing, the former with his head declined and his shoulders squared, the better to help him through the crowd. Did he guess what blue eyes were intently watching him ? Would he have cared though he had been apprised of Veronica's nearness to him ? Insensible Herr Mauritz ! apparently alive only to trade and to the interests of widows old enough to be grandmothers, as Veronica had ascertained. Once there was some promise of a little huzza as a tribute to the young man who was carrying the people's message to the burgomasters ; but Herr Mauritz put it down with a wave of his hand. He was not a man to be gratified by acclamations, more especially as his task yet lay before him ; and so he ran rapidly up the steps to the Stadthaus, parting with his escort respectable, grieved, almost mutinous men of Amsterdam, Gouda, Delft, and Rotterdam \u2014 on the landing-place.

Look beyond itj balcony into the long windows wreathed with the sculptor's art, to the company seated round a heavy and most imposing table, and reverent as the signiors of Venice under their Doge. They were men who represented bursting stores, ships water-logged with their cargo-weight, plantations, cotton fields, cinnamon groves, feathery palm trees and apple-bearing pines away in the tropics ; men who, if this city of the sea should sink in its own mud, could rear it again from end to end on mightier piles, and dwell once more as \" on the tops of the trees,\" without being ruined by the outlay. They were men whose beards were white with the snows of many winters, and whose cheeks were bronzed with other climates than that of grey and foggy Holland \u2014 men in office, with massive chains and weighty seals, who maintained the dignity and discipline of Rotterdam. What hope was there that they would give ear to the young Delft trader, with only right and genius on his side, whom even a little Dutch girl was prepared to reject as unworthy of her hand ? Mauri- \u00bb 'as introduced into the hall. He advanced with m?fey strides, but without unseemly haste or pertur bation; liis cocked hat under his arm and his fair curls hanging down his back. Veronica saw him there, just like a little puppet three inches long, in Marie's glass; and the brave burgomasters, courteous, as all great men are till they are contradicted, leaned back and solemnly contem plated him, and evidently compared notes as to what"], [187, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 175 could be the business warranting his encroaching on their valuable time and important engagements. Mauritz stood quite alone as he began to speak. He was eyed and scrutinized by those tremendous burgo masters, each one a Geoffrey Hudson, without his lugger and pistols, but with crews ten times more numerous, a hundred times more devoted, and pens as deadly as the old settler's pistols. But there is no weakness in his air, and Veronica could have sworn there was no hesitation in his tongue. The burgomasters are roused to his object. They shake their locks and growl out of their beards, and laugh right daunting laughter. They are like Goliath, only Goliath multiplied, while David still stands solitary. He holds on ; he will speak to the end, and will have a hearing, as he has earnestly undertaken the mission. He leans forward with his cocked hat pressed against his breast, and his blue eyes fixed on the listeners. He remonstrates, not loudly, nor in a rude braggart tone, for the burgomasters never lift a finger to their attendant officers ; but with a calm, earnest irresistible force. The burgomasters again lean back and permit him to finish his argument. One indeed interrupts him, but only to interrogate him and test his information. He stands the examination well, and still pursues his protest. What can resist that quiet courage ? The burgomasters look at each other ; at length one rises and signs to silence the speaker. He proposes a compromise \u2014 some vacilating, half-and-half, cowardly amendment, more fatal than the great order itself. He looks pleasant!)' at"], [188, "Days of Yore. 176 Mauritz, as one would pat a man on the back prepara tory to administering to him an agreeable, but danger ous, dose of slow poison. The other burgomasters, almost with one consent, fly upon the rash man as one with whom, however unwise, it is not beneath their rank to struggle. They wrangle fiercely. It is a formidable encounter \u2014 a battle of the elephants. The storm is followed by a dead calm, when the combatants begin to feel disgusted with themselves and the whole affair of the order. A leading burgomaster rises slowly and proposes, with sufficient sternness, to repeal order and counter-order until the next Kermis, until the sense of the States-General can be had on the question, as the burgomasters of Rotterdam are not wont to enact their laws in secret and with such summary despatch. The reaction had begun ; the relief from present difficulty is received with as much acclamation as if the trouble had not been of their own making. They even smile grimly on Herr Mauritz, and wish him well, and acknowledge Delft as a good town \u2014 one of the gems included in the crown of the Seven Provinces \u2014 and then dismiss its young ambassador with many com pliments. Herr Mauritz stands with sparkling eyes and glowing cheeks in the doorway, pressing the hands of those nearest to him. He speaks a few rapid words to the concourse without, and there arises, swelling, a roar of joy and pride and admiration for the burgomasters of Rotterdam and in glory of Herr Mauritz, the defender of"], [189, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 177 the other towns in the alliance. It was such a cheer as might have caused even the mighty burgomasters' ears to tingle. Veronica hurries home ere the streets are farther crowded, ere she is detected in the by-lanes of the town. Reaching home, she hears that the grateful friends ot free trade, the citizens of Gouda, Delft, Haarlem, and Amsterdam, are to entertain her bridegroom at a banquet in that very Stadthaus which he so lately entered to crave their exemption from injury. All the world is now talking of Mauritz Heemkirk and vaunting his goodness and greatness ; and not only strangers, but her old acquaint ances, are curious to see Veronica Vanstraelen again and recognise her as the bride of one so highly distinguished. Adrian Vanstraelen is now a thrice happy man, but little Veronica is hardly yet a happy woman. V.\u2014 THE NIGHT IN THE STADTHAUS \u2014 MAURITZ AND VERONICA. The grand old Stadthaus is rustling with trades' banners and rich stuffs, and is crowded with rejoicing guests as sembled in honour of Mauritz Heemkirk. Women as well as men figure in the gala : the burghers' wives and daughters in their open bodices, lace caps, and plaited hair, as well as the men in their velvet coats and jerkins, their falling collars and long cravats. Mauritz sits in the chief place, surrounded by the principal persons in the room. Adrian Vanstraelen is beside him, but Veronica is at a distance with Aunt Katrina and the N"], [190, "178 Days of Yore. country cousins. The bride and bridegroom have changed characters \u2014 Veronica is now hanging her head and droop ing her clear blue eyes, though many hearts are envying her. Jacqueline Netscher has changed her mind, and cousin Hans has shrunk into utter obscurity. Veronica is vexed with herself that she has mistaken Mauritz \u2014 \u2022 been so blind, stupid, wilful, and wicked. She knows the world is deceived, and that she is nothing to the young hero, Mauritz. Ah ! if he had been but foiled, wronged, shamed, in place of being thus crowned with victory ; if he had but wanted comfort, support, and faith in his bravery and truth ; then she might have made herself something to him. But was she not selfish to think of such a thing ? Perhaps Mauritz Heemkirk had no heart to bestow and had not dealt fairly with her father when he professed to meet his overtures. A shade of sadness certainly did hang about Mauritz as he sat there, the king of the hour, in the great trading city ; he sighed as the gla, _ touched his lips, and he squeezed the lemon-rind with a return of his old listless air. Was some fair maiden of Delft in Mauritz's thoughts ? Was he crossed in love and sick at heart, that he grew weary in the midst of his ovation ? Yet he was not the same sluggish fellow here as he might be in his chimney-corner or in a mere social gathering. He was here as a public character, and to the credit of his town he bore himself with manli ness and dignity, though he said but little. His life was in his deeds, not in his words. But some thorns were about the roses now offered to the couple at the Stadthaus banquet, as indeed there are"], [191, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 179 sharp prickles about many another posy vouchsafed to fortune's favourites. Adrian Vanstraelen, Veronica, Aunt Katrina, and Mau ritz Heemkirk \u2014 all the parties interested in the treaty were collected in the summer-house in the Vanstraelens' garden. The moment of explanation was come. It was an early summer evening, cloudy, but with bursts of splendour. The Kermis was still sounding faintly in the far-off streets. The lulling murmur of water \u2014 the peculiar strength and serenity of these lowlands of Hol land \u2014 was in the air. Pipes and tobacco lay in the summer-house ready for Adrian and his guest ; Veronica's easel, at which the little girl made many ambitious dashes after the manner of Hobbima and Cuyp, was in one corner, while Aunt Katrina's chair, in which she sat clicking her knitting needles and dropping her ball chiefly for Mauritz to pick up, was in another. Veronica had obstinately remained without watering and tying up her carnations, until she was summoned authoritatively to the consultation and installed, trembling and miserable, as on the eve of the Kermis, in the companion chair to Aunt Katrina. Mauritz was no longer the representative of the burghers or the guest of the banquet in the Stadthaus. He was a disturbed, harrassed young man, as he stood there with his hand hanging over the back of Aunt Katrina's chair, his eyes fixed on the ground at his feet. He was prepar ing himself to deal with what some sensitive spirits feel so hard to discuss \u2014 private interests. He did not express N 2"], [192, "180 Days of Yore. himself distinctly, however, and was grieved to the heart to disappoint Herr Vanstraelen. He felt deeply his condescending regard, but he need scarcely state that he withdrew from the proposed alliance. Veronica's bosom gave one great heave, and then she raised her head, pale as a lily. Adrian looked puzzled, hurt, and all but deeply offended. \" What ! what ! \" cries Aunt Katrina in dismay, \" the marriage be put off at this time of day ? Impossible ! Even the myrtle-crown is woven. The fashion of the clothes, too, will change ; they cannot be stowed away like the linen. The marriage put off, when the wedding gown is made ? impossible ! \" Veronica was to have wedded to save the house of Vanstraelen, but now it seemed as though she must wed in order to use her wedding clothes. \" Herr Mauritz, you have been a benefactor to the states ; but I am not the man to press my alliance on another, or to bid for a husband to my child. Yet I would fain think there is an error somewhere. Let us be frank together once more, Mauritz. Why did you deceive me?\" \" I did not deceive you, mein Herr,\" averred the culprit sorrowfully, \" unless \" \u2014 and now indeed he broke down and crimsoned, and was covered with confusion \u2014 \" so far as I deceived myself in the vain fancy that all might come right, that our opinions might correspond.\" \"And wherein did they differ?\" inquired Adrian, coldly, \" and wherefore did you not inform me at once that you"], [193, "Days of t/ie Dutch Fair. 181 were disinclined to the contract and dissatisfied with your prospects ? \" \" I disinclined ! I dissatisfied ! \" repeated Mauritz, bitterly. \" You must see, Herr Adrian, that I have offered no objection.\" \" Then there was no obstacle, Mauritz Heemkirk, no previous hindrance on your part ? \" \" Herr Vanstraelen, you are cruel ; you compel me to explain myself and to be doubly repulsed. I was honest; I desired no more honourable father-in-law. But my mind misgave me on the road to Rotterdam ; my mind misgave me utterly when I saw the Fraulein, when I was presented to Veronica and felt how far she was above me, a dull Delft trader \u2014 above me, like the flowers and the stars. I had but to confirm my impression until it was completely past doubt. Now Herr Vanstraelen, are you satisfied ? After all, it is no humiliation to me ; though sorrow is at the bottom of my heart. I can bear it. Father Adrian is right; I have served Rotterdam and Delft, and that should so far silence my regrets ; anyway, I cannot be sorry that I came to the Kermis. No, I cannot wish the deed undone. Veronica need never fear for me; for, indeed, I had hardly one dream of success.\" \" Mauritz, never woman would have daunted me. The fairer she might have been, the fonder I would have grown. I would have won her by true love; would have drawn her to me by my will, my manhood, my right to conquer her.\" Mauritz lifted his head and spoke passionately \u2014 \" Then"], [194, "182 Days of Yore. you must have been free \u2014 she must have been free. There must have been no constraint on the daughter of the great Rotterdam merchant, no favour to the Delft trader.\" \" I cannot tell,\" protested Adrian, \" the rather that I reckon you well matched ; but I am willing to indulge your scruples and try your conditions. Away, then, with the compact ; let us think no more of the two houses, or of filial duty, whatever Pastor Meulen may say of it. What say you, Mauritz \u2014 will you enter the lists ? What say you, Veronica \u2014 will you authorize the candidate and dare him do his worst ? The daylight is for all. The pure young girl, as yet fancy free, holds a court, which every brave, honest man of her degree \u2014 or out of it, in good sooth, if he be good and great enough \u2014 may enter and contest for her regard, till she elect her sovereign and mate.\" \" Ah ! what say you, Veronica ? \" questioned Mauritz. The heavy fetters had now fallen from the victor of the Kermis, and he turned impetuously, earnestly, towards her. As a balsam-flower blooms on in mute acceptance of the observer's admiration and with a sort of sweet, silent assertion that it blooms for him, so Veronica sat, all outwardly bright, fair, and still, for the reason that the spirit within her was faint with bliss. She was sweetly passive, neither assenting nor denying; and who hesitates to pluck the balsam-flower ? Mauritz gently, reverently, but with firm, manly hand, gathered his Veronica. \" Pla ! ha ! \" laughs Adrian, as he strolls round his garden, smoking his meerschaum and examining his"], [195, "Days of the Dutch Fair. 183 early fruits. \" The betrothal and the marriage will not be a day deferred, I warrant, notwithstanding the open contest. I had forgotten myself; I was as simple as sister Katrina ! I only thought that Mauritz deserved the best girl \u2014 that no good girl could resist Mauritz ; and that my poor Gretchen's Rika merited a noble husband. And the house of Vanstraelen is saved, and I have prospered in my old age.\" And the good man forgot his disappointments, and blamed himself for having ever murmured. The early track-boat was approaching brick-built Delft. Already the old gateways were in sight. The fine old Gothic church, famous for its peal of bells, glimmered through the trees. The Oude Kirk, with its masses of grey masonry and clusters of houses and shops within the recesses of its buttresses, crept into view. Yonder were the tombs of Father William the soldier, and Grotius the scholar, the tombs likewise of Tromp and Hein the sailors. Yonder were the avenues so perfect that they formed green bowers in the streets of the old emporium of crockery. From the track-boat's little cabin windows, with, their chintz curtains and their pots of flowers, peeped a pair of lively blue eyes, which a second pair of calm blue eyes did their best to guide and instruct. Delft had not, any more than Rotterdam, fully ap preciated her young Mauritz Heemkirk. Nay, there were individuals in the town who were still well assured that though Mauritz was a wonderful young fellow at a pinch, he would be but a poor wooer, and that he would tramp"], [196, "184 Days of Yore. home from Rotterdam Kermis to his father's chimney corner, empty-handed and wifeless. The track-boat was earnestly looked for that morning. Mauritz's father and mother and family were eager to welcome with all honour the wife of their beloved Mauritz. The track-boat arrived earlier than was expected by the family, so that there was great hurry and scurry, the Heemkirks being too late to meet and greet the bride. But the track-boat never comes too early for the calcu lating eyes of spies. There was a mortifying impression that a hood, very different from the light head-dresses of the market women, threw itself up from behind a vast pyramid of chests and boxes on the pier. There was likewise a wicked sugges tion that the little lady's inclinations had not been consulted, and that she had been dragged to enroll herself unwillingly among the dames of Delft. These gossippings were vexatious enough, but more so still the chatter about its being only like Mauritz to be so rude and inattentive as to leave his wife and lean over the boat's side to shout to one of his father's workmen. But of course they could not tell that he broke through etiquette to inquire, in the kindness of his heart, after a poor ague-stricken foreman ; and to ascertain too with pride that his dear friend, Herr Leuwenhock, whom he considered to be, like Veronica, high as flowers and stars above his plain, useful self, had already arrived at Delft, according to appointment, to share his gladness, and to paint his fair young wife for the delight of future generations."], [197, "Days of thie Dutch Fair. 185 The track-boat stopped ere Herr Mauritz, somewhat deliberate, had finished his conversation with the work man. Veronica, so far from hanging back, stole a march upon him, putting her foot on the drawbridge. But the slipperiness and the sudden change from motion to rest frightened her a little, and she looked back for Mauritz. Had the gossips been near enough, they would have heard the frank, tender voice softly crying, \" Mauritz ! Mauritz ! \" So soon had the child learned that the lion to his foes was as the lamb to his friends and his mistress. Even as it was, they were compelled to remark the fresh, blithe, balsam face, to note how nimbly Mauritz sprang across to her, and to chronicle how the pair went talking and laughing sprightly enough up the quaint trim garden to the quaint trim house in the early summer morning."], [198, "THE GREAT ROAD AND THE MARKET-PLACE. I. \u2014 THE MAIL STOPPED. (~\\$ a summer night in the time of the German Georges, one of the coaches on the south road was rolling through green lanes and past village commons. It was not unaccompanied. Horsemen before and horsemen behind, in wrap-rascals and with blunderbusses, protected His Majesty's mail \u2014 by no means very effectually. The gentlemen of the road were not only more picturesque \u2014 \u25a0 in their scarlet cloaks and feathered hats, with crape over their handsome, impudent faces \u2014 than those guards, but they were also much more capable in their business. You could not open a newsprint but you read of His Majesty's mail having been robbed on Willow Heath or at Brookleigh cross roads. It did not much interfere with this branch of business or diversion that highwaymen went to Tyburn. They were hung by the dozen, or at least were sure to bear each other company in pairs or trios, and their bones swung in chains \u2014 dismal sign-posts \u2014 at every shady, secluded point on the great roads. Indeed, so used were travellers to a fight, or a scuffle, if nothing"], [199, "The Great Road and the Market-place. 187 worse, that it is probable the more adventurous were a shade disappointed when they wholly escaped. There was then nothing to talk about in the village inns or wainscotted parlours, nothing to brag of to simple applauding ears. It was like having the trouble of rounding Cape Horn without catching sight of a single iceberg. Any way, the bulky coaches continued to run, though not so frequently as in later days, and had their freight, not quite so numerous in proportion to their com paratively rare expeditions, but still they were not to be slighted. On the present occasion there were only three \" insides ; \" but outside, perched and stowed away among bales and boxes, whence they could see far and near, there sat, jeering each other, comforting each other, digging into each other's sides with rough elbows, and dashing into each other's humours with brawny, boisterous jokes, a whole Canterbury pilgrimage of slim students, spruce tradesmen, slovenly graziers, and country women in steeple-crowned hats, and bearing baskets. Our affair, however, is with the \" insides\" \u2014 a gentle story should only deal with gentlefolks. Not that they were all gentlefolks in the inside either. A shrewd observer could have guessed that one was the elderly confidential maid of my lady yawning and groaning in the corner yonder. My lady's lap-dog and parrot were of course there too \u2014 a beast and a bird of gentle degree. The middle-aged gentleman who held himself aloof, and read now and then in a little volume bound in black leather, much worn by constant use, was truly a plain enough specimen of the quality. He wore"], [200, "188 Days of Yore. no buckles in his square shoes. There was no lace on his coat, and no powder in his light brown hair. A parson's bands were openly displayed, and the frills at his wrists were of simple cambric. But look how clean cut his features ; how white his hand in its sinewy shape liness ; how easy his carriage ; how full of quiet dignity his bearing ! He is but a parson, and, strange to say, not ashamed of his calling. Undoubtedly he is a man of birth and breeding. My lady perceives all that with the corner of her eye, now so languid, now so impetuous, querulous now, and again satirical. And my lady should know well, for, considering her years, few have had greater experience among fine company and fine gentle men, from the Princesses and Lord Fanny to that pretty fellow Bond, the actor, with whom wild Lady Harriet \u2014 Lady Mary's crony \u2014 had eloped. But my lady is of quite different metal. She is not old ; not above four -and-twenty, though her soft cheeks are wan where the paint has been rubbed off, and hollow with experiences of the gay revels kept up till daybreak. She has a feverish, capricious, fitful face which should have expressed something infinitely better. The fading lines of beauty are of noble character ; the brow is open, the little pouted, twisted mouth has a thousand sensitive curves and soft dimples hovering round it. It is a face that should have shown thought and feeling \u2014 it should have been a good, kind face ; but it is only a dissatisfied, peevish, scornful one, its varied elements expressive of vacant wretchedness. Poor Mistress Belinda (familiarly and jauntily termed"], [201, "The Great Road and the Market-place. 189 Mistress Bell) \u2014 was a rich indigo planter's orphan daughter, and heiress of the easy county member, and his fat, sleepy wife. They are very well pleased with Belinda's wit, and wealth, and beauty, and by no means tired of their charge ; but they do not control her, nor dote upon her as her dead father and mother might have done. They are rather amused at her whims, and her instinctive aversion to give any one of those heady extravagant beaux right to call himself master of her charms and fortune. They submit, with a few remonstrances and great coolness, when she suddenly tires of auctions and ridottos, and takes it into her head to go down with her maid Dutton and her man-servant Roger to Dutton's mother, who has a cot- tage in Sussex. It is the height of summer, and Mistress Belinda was once in the country when a child, and found rest playing among the young lambs and the buttercups. Perhaps she may find rest among the young lambs and the buttercups again. Oh ! spoilt, fine lady, you have been too affected and frivolous ; you have divorced yourself from nature. See, the may is actually scratching the sides of the coach, and those graziers are thrusting down their sticks to grapple it because it smells rarely ; and you can only turn to your ambergris. The bay mare and her foal neighing over the farm gate win no notice from you. The daffodil sky does not remind you of the last spring's daffodils, it has only a faint trace of amber brocades. Even where it is ruddiest it only suggests to you the heap of gold guineas when my lord is at play, his haggard face seen by the guttering candles in a corner of the ball-room. But, poor heart I"], [202, "Days of Yore. 190 there is some good in you yet, for you are sick of these follies. Roger, riding there among the coach guard, is a smart servant enough in his long vest and long boots. Dutton is a heavy lump of matter-of-fact fidelity in a dowdy cap and cloak. She feels for nothing, is concerned with nothing, but my lady's aching finger, or the satin mantua, lace hood, and riding hat with which she is plentifully encumbered. Perhaps she has a thought for Maitre the poodle, and Poll the parrot. She listens reverentially to her mistress's stories when she chooses to be com- municative, likes to hear her talk of her partners, her freaks, her flouts. Dutton, indeed, is so wedded to her post that she thinks less of her poor blind mother, knitting and nodding yonder in her clematis porch, or by the Dutch tiles of her chimney nook, than of her flighty mistress's coquetry. But Dutton herself is a worthy soul, and a dutiful daughter, for she regularly makes the old woman a liberal offering from her wages. At present, when she has an idea to spare from my lady, who is tossing on her cushions, or Poll, viciously fluttering to peck her finger, or Maitre, wheezing after his last bun, it is one of dim forboding horror of those terrible gentlemen of the road. The bleached bones look so ghastly, dangling in rusty fetters under the rosy sunset.

His velvet coat is seen peeping out beneath it, and his mask is silvered. They are like the very dominos and masks, Madam Belinda, which you have so often seen in the throng at the fashionable masquerades. There are volleys of oaths and exclamations, lashing and rearing of horses. Very shortly the mounted grooms close in. A positive howl is set up by Dutton. Mistress Belinda has rather an aroused, interested air about her ; while the parson deliberately draws down the window at his side, though he had no pistol, not even a rapier, only a cudgel, like dear, homely, benevolent Mr. Burchell. It was but an inglorious warfare after all. The grooms' rusty old firelocks just flashed in the pan. The highway men magnanimously fired a stray shot or two high over-head, and contented themselves with punching the ears of a turbulent cattle-dealer,, and, quick as lightning, pinioning the firiest of the students. In a moment they were actually exchanging cool greetings with one of the country-women in the steeple-crowned hats. \" What ! Patty, lass ; you there ! \" \" Ay, ay, Dick, my man, it won't be long till you wear the hempen cravat.\" The coachman, who had drawn up, now sat as stark still as if it were a point of honour to permit His"], [204, "Days of Yore. 192 Majesty's mail to be quietly sacked and gutted. The grooms were tumbling down obediently from the roadsters, or scampering off faster than the gentlemen of the road had ridden to the onslaught. Mistress Belinda's eyes, quite clear considering the occasion, detected a grin of intelligence on the face of that false villain Roger, who was as accommodating as the rest. Tame submission and vile collusion in the train of an act of sordid pocket-picking. Faugh! There was nothing in it which savoured even of the mock heroic ! Mistress Belinda felt as if she could have flung her purse in the chief's face, and followed it by her gold watch, and been faintly gratified if she had dinted that silvered head piece, or bruised the impudent cheek. But, after all, the rogues are not proceeding in the common way to rifle pockets and appropriate jewels. They have been consulting together, and now their mouth-piece proclaims through his nose : \" Ladies and Gentlemen of his Majesty's public \u2014 no harm is intended to you, not a stiver will be taken from you !

I'm not in the least affrighted; he will not dare to do me a real injury;\" and in spite of the clergyman's fatherly \" Stay, madain, stay, I beg, I entreat\" \u2014 she swam gracefully out before his astonished eyes, accepted the highwayman's hand, and walked away with him, perhaps half a dozen yards, along the field-path by the ditch with its flags and briony hedge, while the rest of the cavalcade remained waiting the result of the puzzling interview. The clergyman broke the comparative stillness by commencing sonorously, \" Misguided men ! \" but he was interrupted by cries : \" Hey, a sermon from a new fashioned pulpit,\" \"Gag him,\" \" Pink him,\" \"No, no, let his reverence say his say, and Jack will deliver the amen.\" The sounds subsiding, the parson continued unmoved : \" Whether you be what you seem or not, you are engaged in an unlawful act \u2014 an act of violence \u2014 and they who use the sword shall perish by the sword.\" But, as he said the last word, there arose such a swell of derision, that the well-modulated sweet voice of the parson was lost for a time. After a little, however, it made itself heard as calmly as before. \" But I do not mean to judge y0U \u2014 1 am not here to condemn \u2014 that is not my com mission ; my business is to befriend you, and if you will meet me, my masters, as many of you as can, at the"], [206, "Days of Yore. 194 market-place at Hazelton, to-morrow afternoon, at three o'clock, I will tell you more of my message, and, please the Lord, show you something to your eternal advantage.\" The remarkable simplicity and confidence of this invita tion fairly staggered the rude audience. The gentlemen of the road looked down to the ground, or stared blankly at each other. The graziers, relieved from anticipations of loss, whistled as loud as they could ; while the clerks and students whispered and nodded to each other, and bent over the coach half curious, half contemptuous. In the meantime, the couple by the trampled wheat field had their colloquy ; strange to say it was Mistress Belinda who spoke first. \" You are an oaf, Master Fenton, an insolent oaf, to bribe my servants and dog my steps,\" she exclaimed with the most superb disdain. She seemed to forget wholly that the fine gentleman, if he were daring enough, could have strangled her, or drowned her in the next pond, or have lifted her on one of those bony horses and spirited her away, while she, helpless, could only gnash her teeth, and run her nails into her palms. \" Madam,\" answered the gentleman, in a piqued but pacific tone, at the same time removing his mask, and exposing a face not unlike her own in its wasted comeli ness, the only difference at this moment being that his was eager and tremulous, while hers was set and hard, \" Madam, your uncle threw me over as light as a feather. Poor Roger only told me that you were going down into the country\u2014 he knew no more. I took this road at a venture. Having heard you say that you knew"], [207, "The Great Road and the Market place. 195 Sussex, I reasoned that you must have friends in that quarter.\" \"And fine company you have found on the road \u2014 mighty fine and fitting company !\" repeated Mistress Be linda, scornfully. \" Oh ! \" replied Master Fenton, \" they stopped my coach only half an hour ago, and I offered to let them have my money peaceably, and to send them another roll of notes to a safe place to-morrow, provided they would lend me their countenance to intercept a lady travelling in the mail, and allow me five minutes to ask her an important question, and then suffer her and her fellow-travellers to go on without further molestation.\" He was not a whit abashed, but went on striking his boot all the time with that air of ineffable effrontery and graceless good humour which distinguished the beaux of that era. But the lady was not to be so easily propitiated : \"Sup pose I decline to answer your question, sir ; suppose I denounce you to the government;\" so she flounced. \"Surely you could never be so unkind, Mistress Belin da!\" remonstrated he; \"but if it were to come to the worst, I am certain it would reconcile me to my fate to see you come and weep repentant tears at my execution ; since all the blood of the Fentons \u2014 good blood, madam, in its own quarter \u2014 would not suffice to substitute the block for the gibbet.\" \" What do you want ? \" demanded the lady, turning short. \" My feet are soaked with mud ; I shall certainly catch cold, and go off in a decline.\" o 2"], [208, "196 Days of Yore. \"To spite me, Mistress Bell? that would be cruel ! But why have you fled from town and left St. James's and Kensington in mourning ? \" \" Because I'm tired of it,\" said the lady bluntly, and with cold cutting confidence ; \" I've tried the hottest rooms and the greatest crowds and the snuggest suppers ; I've filled my china closet, and bundled all the shep herdesses and dolphins out the back way, to pay my next quarter's bills ; I've been to the drawing-rooms, both the Queen's and the Princess's, aud to Richmond Hill ; I've no turn for play. I tell you there's no more for me to do. I almost wish I would take the small-pox, and wake up some morning hideous, and avoided by all the world, just for novelty's sake. Who knows, perhaps I would feel all the better and more reasonable for it. I'm tired of being what you call a spirited woman, and you know all the town recognises me for that.\" \" Faith madam, they do ; but don't grow desperate ; marry me, and I may perhaps break your spirit.\" \" Never ! Wear your yoke and bear your name, and know that the last is dragged through every tavern and gambling-house and evil assembly in London like that of other husbands ! Where would be the gain ? I should only grow less virtuous. I could not pretend to be fond of you, but yet I might die of jealousy. No, no ; I'm not so mad. If we poor women have not our liberty we have nothing \u2014 'tis our last good.\" The gentleman winced. \" I don't pretend to an equality of excellence and parts,\" he exclaimed indig nantly, \" but the humblest devotion, the most unbounded"], [209, "The Great Road and the Market-place. 197 admiration, might win a little more complacency. By George, madam, I'm blind in my pursuit of you.\" Mistress Belinda performed a sweeping curtsey as the night wind began to blow over the wheat field. \" Then, sir, if you have now recovered your sight, will you per mit me to pass ? \" \" I believe you would not care a straw though I shot myself,\" he complained, with some feeling. \" Better not try, sir, since you could not witness my remorse,\" she answered mockingly. \" Accept my hand,\" he urged again passionately ; \" I will carry you to the Hall, where you may have your fill of the country and its clodhoppers, in state and safety. What was the use of your starting off on this wild-goose chase, to live like a princess disguised as a beggar? I swear it is a shame in your uncle to permit it.\" \" No reflections on my uncle, Master Lancelot. I vow they are of a piece with the rest of your breeding.\" \" Then you will go with me before the next parson, surprise them up in the town yonder with the news of our wedding and proceed straight to the Hall. It is a fine old place, the steward has always assured me,\" continued the gentleman, evidently hurried away by the warmth of his wishes, to which she had not seemed to offer sufficient obstacle. He advanced a step. \" By your leave \u2014 not without my leave, sir,\" said Mistress Belinda, with wicked emphasis, drawing back. The gallant ground his teeth \u2014 these gallants were always in frenzies of passion. \" And why not, mistress, since it is this sprightly country you want ?\" he demanded,"], [210, "198 Days of Yore. this time with a little rudeness, although he was a fine gentleman. \" I've no mind to have my embroidery or my web interrupted by my husband's brawls at the alehouse, after he has fought his cocks ; or my tea-table poisoned by his tobacco, when he has been soaking himself with the chaplain.\" \"I marvel you don't go to Moorfields, madam, and renounce the world at once,\" he remarked, with a sneer. \" Nay,\" answered the poor lady, with something like a sigh, and fingering at one of her knots of ribands, \" I nray play with my heart or my head \u2014 perhaps I have done it already \u2014 but I dare not play with my soul.\" He told her he would follow her to her destination ; she fired again immediately, and called his stanchness an unmannerly, unmanly intrusion. He maintained he would watch over her. She insisted she would have none of his guardianship. He declared he would be ready to receive her commands like her poorest servant. She taunted him with spoiling poor Roger, and declared that hereafter she would not speak to him \u2014 not a single word. He kept the last word, and hoped, hypocritically, that she would excuse his presumption for disobeying her orders, and doubting her unheard-of severity. And so back marched the pair to the coach, the gentleman not even thinking it worth his while to resume his mask as he marshalled the lady through the dashing, disreput able group on the king's highway, who were yet perfectly polite to the fine gentleman who had taken them into his pay and put himself into their power, and to the fine"], [211, "The Great Road and the Market-place i 99 lady, about whom he was so hugely agog. In spite of herself her conductor seated the angry lady beside the perplexed Dutton and the tranquil clerical gentleman, so pitiful in his tranquillity \u2014 pitiful to the noisy, reckless gentlemen of the road, to the stout stupid graziers, to the slight, sharp students, to the trembling Dutton, to the fine gentleman with the flashing eyes, and to the fine lady with the flushing cheeks. II. \u2014 AN OPEN-AIR SERMON, AND ITS RESULTS. In the Market-place of Hazelton, on a horse-block which replaced the old cross, stood a man, on an after noon in June, addressing a noisy rebellious crowd. A well-sized elm rose from the side of the horse-block and shot its branches over the speaker's head, sheltering him from the sun, but not defending him \u2014 though he needed defence. Hazelton was a pretty enough old town, with many gables still fronting the streets, at this point meeting in a square. There was many a broad door and broader window, with tiers of peaked windows in rows above them, and the oddest of little towers, upright on one side and slanting on the other, starting out of the very roofs, and surmounting the line of buildings. It was a town not at all regular or spacious, but great in gardens, on whose walls flourished stone-crop, and over them peeped apple, pear, and plum boughs. Two months hence these plum-boughs would bend, blue, heavy and rich, with dark mellow fruit. The village had a tributary from its river,"], [212, "Days of Yore. 200 intersecting its chequers, and keeping them deliriously cool and fresh, but cutting in most inconveniently aj right angles. This rivulet was crossed by every variety of rustic bridge. The man who stood on that horse-block was evidently a peaceable man by his profession, and a gentleman from his looks and language; but he had chosen an inju dicious hour. The \" Pipe and Tabor \" had sent out its gentlemen, and the scampish \" Forge and Bellows \" its mechanics and tramps. Masses of bloated and besotted men surrounded the cross. Whether any of the gentle men of the road, whom he had appointed to this tryst, had taken him at his word, it were hard to say, but the rash individual who ventured to address them against their will and pleasure would have been more likely to have received common courtesy, or common humanity, from a herd of wild cattle than from the audience he now had around him. It was a seething collection of the refuse of all degrees. The wine stain on vest and cuffs, and the clay soil on smock frock and leather leggings, were but emblems of the defilement on the souls within. And on what points did this assured, audacious man attack that foul mouthed crowd of half-heathen England ? He enlarged on the old, old story of \" temperance, righteousness, and judgment to come.\" But they did not hear so patiently as did the Roman governor. They roared and resisted. They even went the length of battering that pale-faced, unarmed, solitary man with the usual worthy weapons \u2014 filth, as well as filthy talk, dead cats, brooms, and brick-"], [213, "TJie Great Road and tlie Market-place. 201 bats. Bulldogs were hounded upon him, till it seemed as if his blood would in very deed be upon their handj ere they parted. Why, then, did he not attempt a retreat? Or why, if he could not withdraw, did he not climb into the elm-tree ? He had to grasp its stem sometimes, as for very life, when a heavy missile caused him to swerve aside, or, grazing his shoulder, nearly threw him off his balance. Why had he come there at all, and why was he not overcome by such a reception ? He risked his life thus because he came there for dear life itself \u2014 the life that can never die. And he accepted the turmoil as a soldier accepts the wild blaze, shots, and wounds of a battle field. He was used to such scenes ; they formed his field of usefulness, and honour, and glory. As the preacher struggled for a hearing, and as scared children were crying, and poor ragged women wringing their hands, a lady, with a gentleman strolling after her, crossed the Market-place. She was known as the London Madam lodging at Goody Dutton's, who spent the days mostly in drinking whey and drying rose leaves ; he, as the London Gentleman living in rooms he paid for like a prince at the \" Pipe and Tabor,\" and passing the time in fishing and playing at bowls. All the town knew there was some mysterious connection between these two in their visit to Hazelton ; all the town knew that if you saw the one elegant idler, the other was certain not to be far distant. A great hue and cry had been set up about them, but not one man or woman had yet detected them in actual communication. The lady was constantly"], [214, "Days of Yore. 202 fretting and fuming and fatiguing herself. She wandered here and there, and was always dropping down on banks and benches. The gentleman doggedly tracked her footsteps, but usually remained at a respectful distance. She now stopped when she saw the mob, fluttered her fan, hesitated, glanced sharply behind her, and then, with a toss of her head, stationed herself on the outskirts of the crowd among the quietest spectators. The gentle man also stood still, with his hands in his pockets, apparently careless and indifferent. The lady kept her attention directed towards the preacher until her eyes were riveted upon him with interest, as she listened breathlessly. At length her drooping, yellowing, lily-like face mantled with a glow of satisfaction. The gentleman noticed this sign of healthy interest displayed in her face, and he now strove to catch the broken sentences which had caused it He at first frowned, bit his lips, and hung his head, as if in some pain and trouble. Was it a spell then ? Yes, we may say it was a spiritual spell which arrested and melted that pair of wayward gentlefolks \u2014 chance members ol this coarse, furious assembly. A party of men had by this time caught up a felled tree, and were levelling it to thrust it forward into the face of the speaker. \" Spit him,\" \" Treat him to See-saw, Margery Daw,\" \" Carry him round the town on a wooden horse, ha ! ha ! \" rose a host of rude cries. \" Shame, you boors,\" shouted a voice, passionate but clear, amid those thick, coarse, guttural articulations. \" Hands off, you villains ; the stranger wants to do you"], [215, "The Great Road and the Market-place. 203 a benefit, you dirty, malignant curs, and you render cursing for blessing.\" For the first time the preacher looked surprised and touched. Then, after a moment's pause, he bent forward to his champion with a rare smile on his intellectual but loving face. \" Not boors, and villains, and curs, worthy sir,\" \u2014 so he gently rebuked his generous but hasty ally \u2014 \" Not boors, and villains, and curs, but mistaken brethren.\" But the fine gentleman did not heed him. Good reason there was, too, for his obliviousness. His stricken heart was thrilling and bounding with delight, because a pair of slender hands were clasped on his arm, and he heard a soft voice whisper in his ear \u2014 \" That was well, brave Master Lancelot, to stand up for the good clergy man.\" Next moment a peculiar bustle arose in the thorough fare. \" Room for Master Mayor,\" was shouted. \" Make way for the Mayor, who has himself come out, trusty, zealous man, to clap eyes on the knave, and set him in the town stocks, or throw him into the town jail.\" \" Where is this disturber of the public peace ? \" called out a voice in high-flown, pompous accents. The sound issued from a pursed-up mouth, situated, as seemed at first glance, in the centre of a face certainly as ruby as the face of any of its proprietor's subordi nates. The Mayor, in his wide-skirted broadcloth, lawn frills, and puffed-out person, was enthusiastically carried for ward to do his office, while at the same time a rush was"], [216, "Days of Yore. 204 made to hustle the unlucky, unpopular offender off his temporary platform. But again the fine gentleman's voice sounded out clearly, but sternly \u2014 \" Your tongue is tripping, Master Mayor.\" Doubtless it was rather an imperious speech to be addressed to a man in authority. The Mayor started and faced round angrily. He scrutinized its author, marked the velvet coat, the lace on the cocked hat, the dainty handkerchief dangling from the flapped pocket, and the finished perfection of the wig. Master Mayor, as a merchant draper, could of course estimate these articles at their proper value. He boggled in his arrogant orders, rubbed his eyes, and coughed repeatedly ; and finally led the way to the town hall, considerably crest fallen. The preacher followed submissively, but showing him self neither disturbed nor dismayed at the clamour around him. As he passed by my lady and the fine gentleman \u2014 birds of a different feather from the rest of the flock \u2014 Master Fenton removed his hat gravely, and stood with his scented curls uncovered, in the afternoon sun. Again that placid man recognized the unwonted greet ing, smiled softly in acknowledgment of it, and said distinctly and earnestly, as he was driven along : \" How beit, certain clave unto him and believed; among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris.\" Poor souls ! they did not know the quotation ; but"], [217, "The Great Road and tlie Market-place. 205 they felt somehow that it referred to something grand, noble, and self-sacrificing, consistent with the bearing of the man disappearing in that crew. And they two were even now cleaving unto each other as they turned out of the rapidly emptying market-place. \" Shall we go to the Hall, madam,\" says Master Lancelot dreamily, \" and leam what truth and soberness mean, and discover for ourselves what power lies in those unworldly words ? \" \" That we will,\" replies Mistress Belinda, with the frankness and decision which in themselves were features of that incongruous, artificial, highly-coloured age. I trust you entirely, sir, since your heart responds to an impulse of my own.\" And thus it was that the people of Fenton Hall pre served fond remembrances of a paragon of a squire and his lady \u2014 fine London folk \u2014 who yet married at some quiet country church, and arrived on horseback \u2014 he on his saddle and she on the pillion behind him, like any farmer and his wife ; Mistress Dutton, and Roger, and the squire's own gentleman following ruefully by the carrier's waggon, because somehow Master Lancelot's chariot was under repair up in London. And mighty loving and merry, with a touch of seriousness in their mirth, were these two on this journey, and ever after wards. They abode peacefully at Fenton Hall, and only went up to the town for a holiday. They pondered and said their prayers, farmed and kept house, sported and span, and called each other Darby and Joan, with a zest which never palled. They feasted, but did not riot;"], [218, "206 Days of Yore. jested, but did not blaspheme; were considerate to the well-to-do, and charitable to the poor ; and it was specially noted of them that while they were on friendly terms with their parish rector, they were also very kind to every wandering Methodist."], [219, "INSULATED. I. \u2014 A PECULIAR PHENOMENON, AND A HUSBAND . DILEMMA. TN a certain village which I know well, a peculiar phenomenon occurred every twelve hours. The village was situated by the sea, and naturally enough its harbour, with its little jetty, was very much what the gates were to Eastern cities \u2014 the centre and culminating point of its traffic. Besides, there was at the harbour a great granary in which corn lay in store, so that even when vessels were not arriving and departing, and busily 'lading and unlading, and little boats paddling here and there, carts, with huge country horses and big burly countrymen, bringing in com or potatoes, would skirt the rippling waves, the fetlocks of the reluctant horses being washed in the brine, amid lashing and splashing, shouting and cracking of whips. Finally there would fall on the ear the dull sound of shovelling with spades into the recesses of the granary, and there would perhaps be a slow mounting by ladders to its upper windows where it stood, a great half-blind, weather-stained mass, without chimneys. This stage of the proceeding usually"], [220, "208 Days of Yore. drew together crowds of curs, to wage war with the rats of all descriptions which had sought comfortable proxi mity to the grain. The harbour was a scene of bustle and business ; but once every twelve hours there settled down upon it the most profound repose. It did not follow that this season of intermission was at midnight, or even at sunset. It might be in the full blaze of noon that the harbour and jetty took their daily siesta, or it might be in the long slanting golden beams of the afternoon sun, bringing something like brooding heat in those localities where there was the reflection from the water and the sand, and neither tree nor bush for screen. The shore might be as busy as ever with pedestrians and bathers in pursuit of health or pleasure. Little children might be seen at their endless game of digging and filling little barrows with wet sand, and emptying them out again ; fish-carts rattled along, or reapers cut down the crops in the seaside crofts ; masons built at the sea-wall, or sports men fired crack, crack, at the sea-fowl ; \u2014 but there slept the harbour, hardly a furlong across the glassy bay, deserted and silent, as the port of some city of the dead. The harbour was at that time situated on a promontory which at high tide became an island, and as the natives did not abound in funds, and were not pushed by multi tudinous engagements, it was the rule to suspend business, unless such as could be overtaken by boat, until the sea way was again a sand-way, and the temporary disquali fication was temporarily removed."], [221, "Insulated. 209 The principal inconvenience was experienced by ignorant, rash, or careless persons. They would often be taken unawares by the advance of the tide, and kept prisoner for two or three hours, unless they could un fasten and row a boat on their own account, or contrive to make their situation known on the mainland, and have a boat sent off to their relief from the boatmen's quarters. Odd adventures sometimes took place under the cir cumstances ; ludicrous as well as perilous hair-breadth escapes were made, when, to avoid being put into irksome limbo, bold individuals went wading and springing from stone to stone over the isthmus where the water was already flowing. Men might even have been seen with women in their arms or on their backs. Strong swimmers could easily have swam the distance, but as the sea border was pretty much frequented, this plan was seldom had recourse to. It can easily be conceived, however, that people were often put to their mettle for steady heads and sure feet when they did not succeed in hailing a boat, or make up their minds to submit to the tedious delay. When the last alternative was chosen, the poor waifs usually mounted a green hillock close to the granary, and sat there, like crows on a tree or sheep on a mountain, looking as if they expected the waves to rise and lash its walls. But that was where no secresy was sought, nor concealment intended. Doubtless, during the long his tory of the harbour, foes had been brought into contact there, though I never heard of murder having actually p"], [222, "Days of Yore. 210 been committed at the stirring harbour in the season of its solitude. But I recollect there was one deep pool hidden among the rocks, marked in engineers' charts as \" Grizzy's herring-barrel.\" Was Grizzy a poor forsaken wight who had here met with a false lover, and been summarily disposed of as an unsavoury fish, her contem poraries, with grim, gruesome humour, christening her drowning-place \" Grizzy's herring-barrel ? \" Be that as it may, the story I have to tell was of an angry husband and wife, driven into close quarters, and held by main force from fuming and flouncing out of each other's sight and hearing. It was an abominable pre dicament for a proud, sensitive man. The long interval of inactivity must have been trying and humiliating beyond measure, any attempt at exposure and release being in this case so impossible. The gentleman, though he had heretofore disregarded all arguments of loss of time and waste of victuals to man and beast at the Change-house on the shore, now solemnly vowed to rouse the county, petition the member, and give him no rest, till buttresses Were sunk, and piers built, rising far above the flood, so that no other unhappy man might be thus rendered liable to be held up to public scorn after he had been subjected to keenest private torture. It is easy to read of it and laugh at it, but let any one of my gentleman readers only fancy how he would like to be shut up for at least two hours with a childish, passionate woman, who, as his own wife, will use no ceremony with him, and, more than that, does not care how much she"], [223, "Insulated. 211 exposes him and herself before he can quit the inoppor tune platform. The woman may attempt to drown herself in order to have a chance of throttling her hus band when he attempts to save her. He may be com pelled to get up a diversion and raise a hideous uproar, hoist signals of distress, and call in the spectators in self defence, to prevent himself from becoming the involun tary cause of murder. I don't know what another might have done, but George Stirling, brought up where most men were amphibious, could both row and swim, and when he found himself on the opposite side of the harbour from his wife, aud with the water too far up on the rocks to admit of his walking away in dignity, he might have got off himself by either of these two means. He might have left her till the tide receded, to go back to her home famished, chilled, cowed into better behaviour by solitary confinement, summer day as it was. There were temptations to such a course. George had cer tain information that she intended to take the decisive step of fleeing from his protection to her father's roof the very next day, and leaving him on account of childish wrongs, and on a childish impulse. It was this know ledge, combined with the fear that she might set off that day, in order to have the companionship of a girlish friend who had been living with her, and who was no more able to give Rica advice than she was able to comprehend the bearings of the case, that had brought George Stirling skulking to the harbour. So, hidden tmder the pent-roof of the granary, he had waited till the steamboat hove in sight, and bore away again with the P 2"], [224, "Days of Yore. 212 friend, but without his wife. Then, while he still lingered, to pass away from the harbour unobserved if possible by his wife, the tide got in upon him, and stranded him as well as Rica, who sat mute and motionless after she had waved her handkerchief for the last time to her friend on the hillock by the granary. George had been uncertain what he would have done had his wife stolen the march upon him to-day which she proposed to do to-morrow, though he had resolved he would not stride forward, and for the last time interpose his authority, to prevent the poor foolish thing consummating his and her alienation. And now when he might have rid himself of his share of the dilemma, he did not seek to do so, because it would have been leaving Rica behind him; and he could not do that yet. Nay, he was watching her covertly, but continuously. She had aggravated him, provoked him, grieved him, until he even regretted their marriage, and believed it had been a great mistake ; but still he was not quite indifferent to Rica, II. \u2014 AN UNSOCIABLE PAIR. Rica did not begin their enforced companionship at the harbour by intruding upon George. He had kept out of her way about the corners of the granary, and had strolled down to the water's edge, and remained there till she must have become sensible what had happened to her, become aware that she must stay at the harbour until past their dinner hour. But he"], [225, "Insulated. 213 now felt that further dodging would be to no purpose, as she would be sure to look about her and detect him. He had, besides, an objection to dodging on its own account, and, being struck with the idea that she might be frightened at her situation, he climbed to a point where he would be conspicuously recog nizable, and remained there purposely in sight of her. He saw with a side glance that Rica discovered him as she still sat listless. His heart even beat violently at the start she gave, but the next moment she turned her head and looked steadily and stubbornly out to sea, clearly with no intention of appealing to him. George therefore sat down by the water's edge, his legs dangling over the slippery olive seaweed, and almost touching the searching, gurgling green water, while his wife remained perched on the hillock above. It was very unsociable of the couple. Perhaps not another two in the village \u2014 let them be captain and cabin-boy, lord of the manor and ploughman lad, vicious old maid and giddy young one \u2014 thus imprisoned by the sea would have kept more persistently at the very opposite extremities of their tether. But you will allow that the position of this couple was ambiguous and difficult. Had George Stirling been on the worst terms with a friend, or an acquaintance, they would still have main tained a hypocritical form of civil intercourse ; but whatever he might have done to other men's wives, he could not go up and say, \"How do you do?\" and begin to speculate on the weather to his own wife."], [226, "Days of Yore. 214 George Stirling's marriage had been a bad business so far as it had gone, or indeed was likely to go. Of course it had been delightfully romantic to begin with. Rica was not a Swede or a Dane, as her name might have suggested. She was not even the least of a Dutch woman, though her name was that Dutch one of Vero nica, which came across to Scotland, with Dutch crockery and Dutch flower roots, in the days of the great trade between Holland and the east coast. George Stirling had thought it a pretty name, the prettiest of all names indeed, like the blue, blue flower for which it stands, when he thought to pull another flower and wear it in his breast, without any trouble or self-denial. The blunder was that George had no idea of sacrifice where the gratification of his inclinations was concerned. If he had ever heard or read, he had treated as beneath his notice, the pawky suggestion which Joanna Baillie threw into her song \u2014 \" The chield he had need to be steady, AVho yokes with a mate in her teens.\" Now George Stirling was steady in the ordinaiy accepta tion of the term. He was religious, industrious, and well inclined. If he lived to old age he might become tolerant and gentle ; as it was, he was a man of mature age\u2014 about eight-and-thirty \u2014 a sufficient number of years, one might suppose, to counterbalance Rica's light seven teen. But then it does not always mend matters : on the contrary, it often renders them a great deal worse, when the years of wisdom and wisdom teeth are all on one side."], [227, "Insulated. 215 George Stirling had succeeded to his father's business as banker and agent for the neighbourhood of Marby Cove, and had not thought fit to relinquish his single state till Mrs. Cheyne, his elder sister by ten years, came back a widow from India, with her daughters so nearly grown up that they were gay and sufficiently intelligent companions for their handsome, active uncle, in his prime. Those Cheynes went to school, and brought home on visits young school companions of theirs, who formed fresh and intelligent company for George Stirling. One of these girls was Veronica Bannatyne. She was only seventeen, had but just completed what would have been no more than her second last session at school, and was one of a prosperous wealthy family, which had never known a serious trial. George Stirling was, as Mrs. Cheyne expressed it, infatuated enough to fall in love with and marry her in a breath. Mrs. Cheyne and George's eldest niece, Grace, remem bered perfectly how proud the rosy school-girl with the long, loose, waving, auburn curls had been at the agent's dancing with her, at the unlucky fete which the lord of the manor had chanced to give at that time, and over which George had presided. Mrs. Cheyne and Grace had repeated, with irony, that they believed the week Rica had flown about like a feather, buying her wedding clothes, was the first week, save the Christmas and Mid summer holidays, on which she had ever been absent from school. George had made his choice ; and he was not to be de terred by any accusation of imprudence, or warning from"], [228, "216 Days of Yore. Mrs. Cheyne or any other person in the world. It was three years ago now, and Rica had never grown older in anything, save in whims and humours. That contra diction is apt to happen to very young wives, even when they have children to help in their education, and unluckily Rica had none to help her. She stood still, and was not a bit older at twenty than she had been at seventeen ; not even to losing her rosiness, or putting up her waving auburn girl's curls. George might not have objected to Rica's fixedness in the first days of his enamoured experience as a husband, but he was sorry for it now. He would willingly have compounded by Rica's putting up her curls and losing her carnation, if she would have been \u2014 not more sensible, Rica did not want sense \u2014 but if she would have learnt dignity, self-control, and wise humility; if she would have deferred to his sister, Mrs. Cheyne, been advised by her and not resented her interference, and made the house intolerable with squabbling. Rica took care to show her feelings even before the servants and visitors, was restless and exacting, and subject to fits of sorrow and fits of rage ; in short, she showed herself an impulsive, demonstrative, warm-tempered as well as warm-hearted young vixen. And George, dark, and pale, and bilious, in his big square build was a proud, sensitive man; a man sighing for peace and comfort, groaning for decency and order, and with unconscious sternness, asserting by look and tone, that Rica must submit. Had Rica had any policy she would have tried to agree with Mrs. Cheyne, for she was an excellent woman,"], [229, "Insulated. 217 who had married early and well, and been left by her husband with the sole power of a handsome income. She had conducted herself and brought up her children to perfection, and was everywhere res pected. But Mrs. Cheyne's heart was far harder than even George Stirling's. She had never forgiven George's mar riage, though she deceived herself into the conviction that she had done so. She revenged herself by walking over the head of his poor foolish young wife, laughing, in her own exemplariness, at poor Rica's mistakes, but really exposing them, and pitying her until she galled and goaded excitable Rica to very madness. What would George Stirling have had ? He was fright fully unjust. He had married a child, professing to be in love with her childishness, and after petting and encou raging that childishness for a little while he gradually but decidedly threw it over, and was dissatisfied and even indignant because Rica was not something different from that for which he had married her. His error sprang from what was good in him. He could not be perma nently held by his senses, but he was not the less unjust. Let that rest however. He accepted Mrs. Cheyne's testimony about Rica, which was true in the main, without pausing to ask himself if it were either generous or fair dealing by her, and so he lost his confidence in Rica, and allowed her to lose her confidence in him, and became at last, to his great pain and misery, widely estranged from his wife."], [230, "218 Days of Yore. Rica was not a model woman ; she was very far from being a woman at all. She was but a child, who had been brought up in the most scorched and barren soil \u2014 that of unmingled prosperity. Life to her had been an idle play with no deep meaning in it. She was a headstrong, violent girl, who actually fell into mental and moral diseases, in her bursts of love and admiration, scorn and aversion. She would go out to this party like a very dowdy, to that again like a queen ; she would stay at home from this launch because her husband and all the world expected her to be there, and attend that regatta because George was absent and had rather that she stayed at home, or because she was ill and George considered it necessary for her recovery that she should confine herself to the house. Perversity of this sort is not inconceivable or altogether unattractive in a girl in her teens, and a kind mother or elder sister knows how to break it, but it is intolerable in a woman and a wife. At all events Rica's conduct set all her acquaintances against her, causing them to laugh at and commiserate George till he writhed, as his wife did, at Mrs. Cheyne's too evident condescension and regret. Still Rica was not a bad child, as a child. She was affectionate and pitiful ; she was not without reverence and gropings after faith and its practice. Then how could she be so wilful and unbridled ? Simply for the reason that there was nothing finished and confirmed about her. The child's honest natural heart was on one side, and her good aspirations after a divine life on the other, and there was no connecting link binding them into"], [231, "Insulated. 219 one and enabling her to act them out in her life. Every thing was raw, uncemented about Rica, as about most girls. She was disqualified for a present position of authority and responsibility. She was like an arch without a keystone ; a sermon without an application. Poor young Rica ! she had married George Stirling pleased with a young dream of love, very immature, like everything else about her. She had flattered herself with the prospect of being so young a wife and with the sensation she would excite ; and she had actually been dazzled by what she imagined was to be her lawful independence and supremacy. When tired of feeding on the flower-dew of her fanciful love, and no longer stimulated by public notice, but, instead, superseded, and bitterly disappointed by her failure in indepen dence and supremacy, she was filled with longings for which she had no name. George did not take her to him. He did not tell her how near their interests lay, or how sacred, strong, and sweet were the obligations between them ; and so Rica's married life, up to this point, had been only a mean arena for vanity, dissatisfaction, pets and slights. George, when he married Rica, had not been without a notion of moulding the wax, and bending the twig to his taste and will ; but yet he did not quietly tell her of these things. A human creature with a wayward soul, is something very different from wax and twigs, and the moulding and bending which flesh and blood requires is quite another process, and needs another application, than men imagine. George did like many men in like"], [232, "Days of Yore. 220 circumstances : he let Rica alone. Still he was a righteous man, and purposed to be good to his wife, only he was ignorant and impatient, awkward, and incapable of the nice operation he had undertaken. Mould a wife, quothee ! It may be easier to rule a kingdom. Notwithstanding all that had taken place, the differ ences between George Stirling and Rica were still of such a character that a sufficient shock might move them away, replacing them by the old hopes and wishes, only softened and subdued. For one thing, they were honesl in their differences. What Rica complained of was, that George Stirling did not care for her as he used to do, and Rica crushed her two restless hands together, and beat with her foot on the yielding turf. Then Mrs. Cheyne meddled with her, and molested her; and George suffered it, and even encouraged it ; and she hated Mrs. Cheyne, and would not bear her rule. George complained that Rica was tiresome and troublesome, and did not improve as he was entitled to expect. She was not even grateful or civil to Mrs. Cheyne, who, although she saw it to be her duty to point out Rica's faults, was a good woman, and had his interest and hers also at heart. Rica was not kind \u2014 no, she had lost her trust in him, and had withdrawn her coaxing and caresses. In fine, Rica and he were far from being as they ought to have been, and he really believed she would yet break his heart, though he had never warned her of the probability of that catastrophe. Still no irreparable injury had been done. They had quarrelled, and sulked, and stormed ; officious relatives"], [233, "Insulated. 221 had interfered and worked more mischief; but it was still as if the man and woman were only flirting with misery, though that is truly an appalling flirtation. A heavy blow falling on both of them, a great danger to one or other of them, a sudden sickness, even a word of slander, or a deed of unkindness, might prove sufficient to restore them to their right minds, and to kindle the smouldering flame of their affections. But such opportune accidents or afflictions do not always occur simply to keep wandering sheep within the fold, or to show blinded folk their own blindness. Rica was so besotted and childish that she was on the eve of the fatal compromise of her duties and rights, by quitting her husband without his sanction, and in opposition to his desire. She did not even ask to what it tended, or whether her friends would approve of it. She did not dwell on the consequences. She only felt she could punish George Stirling, calm and cold as he appeared, and violate all Mrs. Cheyne's womanly and wifely theories of virtue, and prove to them both that she could defy them and fly from them. This much, and the rest of Rica's life was wholly beyond her vision. She was mentally short-sighted, as all young creatures are. But if she had seen only an inch farther, she would have discovered that she was at the entrance of a long lane to which, indeed, there was no turning. She could not of her own accord come back again to her husband. It was quite certain George Stirling would not pursue and bring her back. Then, when Rica had deserted her post, and her heart, as well as George Stirling's heart, was empty, and time and pride"], [234, "Days of Yore. 222 had widened their division into a ghastly chasm, the two who had been faithful amid their resentments, might be faithful to each other no longer. III. INTERVENTION WELL MEANT, BUT UNSUCCESSFUL. Rica sat on the little green hillock waiting, waiting, but in vain ; George also sat dangling his legs over the water. And round them circled the glassy sea, reflecting, as in a mirror, the crescent of village houses and their hanging gardens, filled with potatoes and beans, purple thyme, white daisies, yellow marigolds, and crimson gillyflowers ; the kirk upon the hill crowning the whole \u2014 a constant text, bidding the world be at peace, and admonishing the brethren to love one another. In the village streets, rude healthy activity and common cheery cordiality prevailed. Shouts of men at work, mingled with screams of gossip and laughter from the intervening gardens, came across the water along with the prattle of children and the barking of dogs on the beach. As the afternoon advanced, the wind blew perceptibly colder, and a mist, not rare in these quarters, began to rise on the horizon. George Stirling was aware that his wife was fragile and delicate, and he could not allow her to sit stiff and motionless any longer on that exposed hillock. He got up and ascended the little path, and spoke for the first time since they had that morning exchanged mono syllables at the breakfast table. Not even before her friend did Rica pretend to be frank with her husband ; and her friend, a simple, soft, young girl, had gone away"], [235, "Insulated. 223 shaking her head and filled with the most dismal senti ments about matrimony. \" Get up, Rica,\" said George Stirling ; \" don't sit there so long without moving; you'll get rheumatism, or inflammation, or some other ill that you'll repent of.\" She drew herself together, and sat on, without speaking, her rosy face glooming, and her long curls dank and straight, causing her to look still more forlorn. \" As usual,\" he muttered, shrugging his shoulders as he walked away; \"I don't think that girl is in her right mind. I believe she would like to get her death here and then lay it at my door. Oh, Rica, Rica ! \" and he sighed deeply, as he assured himself once more that she had no proper pride or judgment. No proper pride, and no judgment, perhaps, for these are often slow of growth, and sometimes the more precious the more slowly and surely are they ripened. It was no indication, however, that Rica had no heart that she wanted her master to repent, and to do her justice, according to her wild ideas, even although their destruc tion were the ultimate penalty. George was determined not to permit himself to be made childish. He knew he needed all the health and strength he could keep for his worries. He walked about, strolled round and round by the granary, and by the deserted shipping, whose sails were beginning to flap, and their cordage to snore and sing in the breeze, and Ihen he stopped and stood chafing, like some rock-bound Napoleon. As the tide rose, the shore seemed to recede, and its"], [236, "Days of Yore. 224 sands to dwindle away in the distance in the increased rush and dash of the water. Like a surprise the loud growling bark of a dog from the fishers' quarters suddenly sounded. It grew so rough and threatening, that George was tempted for a moment to think that it was one of the numerous dogs accustomed to frequent the granary ready to break out upon them. Rica was nervous, and easily terrified at wild dogs. He expected every instant that for all her spite and naughtiness, she would come bounding towards him, clasp him, and cry to him to save her. But Rica had been able to command her emotion, or her hostility was so great, so overpowering, that not even in agony would she rush to him. She was realizing their separation already ; she would die sooner than approach her husband for succour. Hoarser and hoarser the increasing waves came curling round the harbour rock ; farther and farther retired the shore. These two, alienated husband and wife, were more and more alone together. George felt the stillness, the compulsory association, the insurmountable avoid- ance, and the narrowing bounds, to be unendurable. He started forward to try if he could not signal to the boat- men, and then draw back again. \" She would not go with me ; she would break out and disgrace us botb before the common boatmen,\" he whispered to himself. There was no help for it but to endure the imprisonment. His heart rose to his throat, and choked him as he said \" She will rob me of my wits, as well as break my heart,\" but he did not go near her again. His heated imagination began to get excited even in"], [237, "Insulated. 225 the broad daylight Rica was to him like an enchanted woman placed on that mount, and fixed there as by diablerie. The waves grew so much larger, and drove in so much farther the bubbling and boiling water, changing its colour from blue to grey, from grey to green, like Rica's eyes, that he could almost persuade himself they would come in this tide as they had never come before, and engulph the harbour. Then what could Rica and he do when there was only one dry spot left, before the last wave swept over it ? Would Rica refuse to occupy that spot along with him ? or would she sink into his arms at last, and would there be bliss as well as anguish in such dying? In three quarters of an hour the tide would turn and leave a path of innocent-looking shells and glistening sands, and clear, shallow pools, open from the harbour. They would traverse it apart to his father's old house, which Rica thought so dull, but which she had once, not so very long ago, brightened inexpressibly. Every-day faces and every-day life would be once more around them, but only for a little. Rica would occupy her room but one night more, and then she would go away to her father's \u2014 to the ends of the earth for what concerned him \u2014 and would never return. George wiped his hot face. The waves grew crisp, and flashed round them like steel, and Rica, with a long swooning sigh, had consented to be swallowed up by them. At this point another dash than the dash of the waves roused him from his reverie. It was the rapid, regular beat of a boat, which shot round the rock, not from the Q"], [238, "226 Days of Yore. boatmen's quarters, but from the little landing-place on the beach, where boats disgorged their contents when there was no road from the harbour. The boat was well supplied with rowers and passengers. In it were his friends, Mrs. Cheyne and Grace, Dr. Ainslie and his wife, and Mrs. Ainslie's brothers from England, out for a pleasure sail, and full of holiday talk and laughter. IV. \u2014 RECONCILIATION. The boating party recognised George, and sent towards him a general cry ; but no one looked up to Rica perched on the hillock above them. That in fact was about the last place in which they would have expected to find her. \" Oh ! Uncle George, Uncle George, what are you doing here, like a rat in a cask floating out to sea?\" cried Grace Cheyne, with a peal of merry laughter. \" Rather like a dog whose kennel has been flooded ; could you not find a boat to put off, or why did you no) manage to make your situation known when you dis covered that you were left behind ? I cannot think how it could have happened,\" questioned Mrs. Cheyne. \" But we are all well met,\" she continued ; \" we would have sent up to the Bank for you, but we had not time. Come and join us.\" George shook his head. \" Do, Uncle George,\" urged Grace ; \" it is too late in the day for you to do business now, even if you could get to the shore with a wish. What are you going"], [239, "Insulated. 227 to do waiting like a hermit there? The boatmen say the mist will not come down any nearer, and we have the dredging-net, and Dr. Ainslie here says you can sort its spoil better than he can.\" \" No,\" said George decidedly, \" I cannot leave ; Mrs. Stirling is up above there.\" There was an abrupt, awkward pause, while the holiday company glanced up at Rica \u2014 a pause which shewed dis tinctly how much may be thought when nothing is said. Rica saw and heard them plainly, and would have in her word. It was her way, and she would indicate beyond a doubt the position over which her husband had thrown a veil. \"Don't stay for me, Mr. Stirling,\" she called out to him, looking over her shoulder at them with her dishevelled hair all blown about her face ; \" You did not come with me here ; I can do very well by myself, I will soon be released now.\" She uttered the last words with a gasp, as if they contained more than met the ear. George did not heed the words. The party were puz zled. Grace and her mother exchanged glances. \" Come down and go with us yourself, Aunty Rica,\" solicited Grace hesitatingly, though she used the appellation as if to propitiate Rica, and make friends with her in presence of the Ainslies and their relations, for Grace was her mother's daughter. \" You will like it, the motion is no more than a pleasant rock to-day, and it will be much nicer than the dreadful bore of sitting out the tide.\" \"Put up your hair, Rica, and George will hand you in,\" added Mrs. Cheyne, somewhat patronisingly. Q 2"], [240, "228 Days of Yore. \" No,\" answered Rica, with her ill-humoured bluntness, \" I know nothing about crabs and sea-slugs.\" That was just Rica again. Her husband was scientific, so were the Cheynes and their set, and Rica was quite clever enough to suit herself to their tastes, and relish them, and had been fond of displaying how proficient she would be in time when she came first to Marby Cove. But now, to believe her, she did not care for a flower, unless it were an artificial one, or for a stone, unless it were a pebble fit for setting at the least. As for fish, she could not tell one from another, unless she saw it cooked upon her table, and she did not even know or care to know then. \" Well, George, I suppose we must leave the dog in his flooded kennel,\" submitted Mrs. Cheyne reluctantly, after a moment's reflection ; \" but it was very foolish of you to forget the hour and the tide and get yourself in that plight.\" \" And the cat, Mrs. Cheyne,\" cried Rica, with asperity, making a face if they had seen it. \" Pray, don't forget the cat at the harbour.\" Though George reddened extremely, it was impossible to restrain a smile at the flippancy. A few strokes of the oar and the pleasure-party were gone to enjoy their gay afternoon, and George Stirling and Rica were once more left in the apathy, solitude, and desertion of the harbour. George was surprised by Rica getting up and scrambling down to him, arresting herself with difficulty at his side. \" George Stirling,\" she said, \"why did you not go with your"], [241, "Insulated. 229 friends ? I don't want you.\" That was ungracious enough, but the next breath it was impetuously, \" George, why did you not go with them ? You would all have enjoyed it so much, if I had not been in your way.\" George was more softened than he had been for many days, more touched than there was any cause for, but he only said, \" I would not have enjoyed it, and you left behind here, Rica.\" \" But there are things in which I bear a part that you don't enjoy,\" she argued still in the same disconsolate childish voice. \" There are,\" he answered quietly ; \" but it does not follow there are others I would enjoy without you,\" he added hastily, with a half smile, though he was not in a smiling mood. She did not speak again for the next half hour, during which the tide turned, and, flowing back, abated, and the sun began to sink, with the promise of a cloudless sunset. She remained standing by his side, and when he shifted his place, so as to shelter her from an eddy of wind which blew cold round the corner of the granary, she did not resent or resist, though she was in the habit of factiously opposing such attentions. She stood meditatively, at last gave a fluttering sigh, and spoke as if she were resuming the broken thread of her discourse, \" And so you would be dull without me if I went away, at any time ? \" \"Of course I would,\" exclaimed George, turning aside his head and speaking a little angrily, even at that bare mention of her intention."], [242, "Days of Yore. 230 \"What, with Mrs. Cheyne and Grace, and the rest of them, left you ? \" \" I should think so,\" said George. \" What do you take me for, Rica ? How can you question it ? \" But Rica was not easily daunted \u2014 it was one of her disadvantages, one of the risks she ran, poor, bold, fear less child. \" I did not know there was an ' of course ' in the matter,\" she averred with piteous persistence. \" The more shame to you,\" answered George. There was another long silence ; so long, that the stones became visible on the way to and from the har bour. \"I think I could take you over now, Rica, \u2014 if you care about me taking you,\" he said slowly. Rica trembled perceptibly, but she did not say no, nor draw back. George and Rica had often seen the footing from the harbour made good in the way they were about to attempt it, perhaps they had even practised it before. It was a mode of transit occasionally in request in stormy weather, when the flory boats could not land the steam boat passengers either at the harbour or at the little landing-place. But it was more in fashion with lively brothers and sisters and eager young people, than with husbands and wives of several years standing; and it was assuredly a most inappropriate mode for a couple on bad terms. It was a progress that could hardly be made without jesting, unless it should be a subject of vehe ment, engrossing emotion. George was to carry Rica across these slippery stones, holding her clear above the water, so firmly, that she should not sway in his hold,"], [243, "Insulated. 231 for then both might lose their balance and be precipitated into the deep water, which still lay on each side, lapping between the stones. Fortunately the promenaders and work-people were all at a safe distance, and there were no spectators to laugh with any peculiar significancy at the feat. Rica offered no resistance, she raised herself voluntarily into his arms; in place of her needing to be told to \" hold on,\" she clung much more tightly than was requisite, never once sifting her head, which was pressed against his breast, as he had looked for her doing in the alarm of the dog barking at the harbour. George made out his exciting passage safely, and put Rica down on the beach, still holding her hands to steady her. They were now on common ground, and he noticed a group of their sea-bathing acquaintances within sight, and knew, if he did not make quick use of his opportunity, it would slip from him altogether, so he suddenly asked, \" Rica, were you very much frightened? Come, now, as the price of your crossing, tell me why did you hold me so tight ? You bent down my head, but as I was forced to pick my steps, that did not much signify.\" \" Never mind,\" said Rica shyly, as she stood there dizzy and spent, with her rosy cheeks blanched and dim, and her hair in elf locks. They walked along, arm-in arm, in the golden light, like lovers \u2014 like true husband and wrife. \" No, Rica ; what were you thinking of? Give me your thought for your passage-money; it is all I will take, and you will never be so dishonest as to refuse it.\""], [244, "Days of Yore. 232 \" You may have it, then,\" Rica answered, with a sob. \" I wished I might die there when you held me, and no body came between us, George \u2014 die as husband and wife.' Good and practical man as George Stirling was, he did not show himself shocked, nor did he rebuke her. Perhaps he thought that, of the two lots, it were better they had perished together in the strait between the shore and the harbour, than if they turned their backs on each other, and travelled two roads in life so different that they had no meeting-place. But he drew her arm more closely within his, and stooped down, and replied with quivering lips, and with all the feeling which he had been with difficulty repressing so long \u2014 \" God forbid that my poor Veronica, whom I wanted to wear upon my breast, should have died there ! Live with me and for me, Rica, and I swear nobody shall henceforth come between us ; \" and they walked on humbly, the golden beams of the sinking sun smiling down upon them. George Stirling and Rica did not go from that beach into an easy, sunny life ; on the contrary, they passed within the shadow of the old agent's house, and looked quiet and grave for many a day afterwards. But they testified a secret inclination to each other from that time; they began to grow towards each other, as trees do that eventually meet and mingle their leafy branches. The most distant whisper of separation was never again mooted between George and Rica Stirling. Indeed, when Rica was mellowed and sobered into an enthusiastic"], [245, "Insulated. 233 but tractable woman, and George smiled at his ease over her flights, and set unmistakable store on her origi nality, it is probable they had all but forgotten that Rica had ever been so tired of her married life, or so ignorant of her accountability. They would have been deeply resentful and mortified had they been reminded of the episode, now when George Stirling was very much astonished to think how he could have ever borne with such undesirable, unseemly oversight of him and his on the part of his sister Mrs. Cheyne, and when it required all Rica's magnanimity to convince him that Mrs. Cheyne possessed many redeeming qualities, and that she was something other than a formal, egotistical, overbearing woman. If \" there is a tide in the affairs of men, that taken at its flood leads on to fortune,\" there is also a tide, that taken at its turn, leads to humility and happiness ; and let us be deeply thankful for it, if it has saved us from the dreary shoals of selfish suspicion, and the misery it necessarily entails."], [246, "RINGAN COCKBURN'S TRIAL AND VICTORY. I. \u2014 THE LAIRD'S WRONGS. A N old tumble-dowm house, which had been white but was now relieved by sundry grass-green patches, stood, seventy years ago, at the end of a short, straight avenue running through a belt of Scotch firs ; beyond it, all around stretched as bleak and rushy moorland as ever clad the poor wards of Lanark. The house was not without pretension : it aimed at being a small place \u2014 a laird's mansion ; but it had no air of prosperity, from its name of Watery Butts (and the winter rain lay weeks in the furrowrs of its sour, stiff clay soil) to the grey stones rent and shattered upon its steep roof, the lintels of the small battered windows defaced and worn, the wooden work crumbled down, and the battered door opening with two leaves like a cupboard. AVithin there was the same evidence of narrow means or waning fortunes. The sitting-room, originally panelled, was destitute of all more modern pretensions to elegance, or even comfort; the bare carpet of thick, grey woollen stuff was not superior to what might be met with in the best room of the one-"], [247, "Ringan CockburAs Trial & Victory. 235 story farmhouse built on the first arable farm beyond these moors. The table was of wainscot, and in the light of the hearth a young woman, with homely striped skirts, and keys at her side as the mistress of the house, sat spinning yarn from a dark polished wheel. The mansion might have fallen into the hands of tenant owners of the humbler class \u2014 moorland farmers only raised a step above their cottars \u2014 but for the central figure, a man of sixty, poring, with keen eyes whose lashes were white as snow, over the cob-webbed, yellow papers of the drawers in an ancient bureau mounted on spindle legs and planted by the window. He occasionally laid them down however to handle with his big, bony hands a few dull chipped stones in the recesses of the repository, and to compare them with a rough basket at his feet filled with the same smutty material. The coarse plaiden coat, the weighty peasant shoes, the tangled grey hair, no more degraded their owner than the ponderous, clumsy, dim frame can overshadow a work of the painter's art. The October sun, now setting behind these dreary tracks, shot its rays through the dispersed, erect, black pines, and piercing the lozenged panes, fell upon the Laird of Watery Butts, dreaming his phantasy ; and a broad, furrowed brow of genius was Ringan Cockbum's, with sharp features, and eyes of wonderful fire looking out beneath their silvery brows. There was nobleness about Ringan Cockburn that no poverty could clog, youth that no old age could quench. He was musing earnestly, with a flush rising upon his sunken cheek : but"], [248, "236 Days of Yore. suddenly he threw down stones and papers, sat erect in his leather-covered elbow chair, and called \" Thrift,\" in tones of cheery command. Thrift Cockbum \u2014 twice Thrift Cockburn, the old Laird's daughter and only child, and at five-and-twenty the composed wife of the laird's nephew and heir, a Cockburn of a younger branch of the same gnarled tree \u2014 obeyed the summons. Side by side, as if for com parison, there were the starry light of science \u2014 all the purer that it was less a thing of facts than of conviction, that it was idealized in its lifelong struggle against groping ignorance and cumbersome difficulties \u2014 and the lowlier, commoner, more blessed beam of household love, lifting as with angel's wings the simple, unreasoning, instinctive nature to the higher, stronger spirit within whose circle it had flourished \u2014 as if the little social moorland lark had fluttered fearlessly to the plumed breast of the lonely, royal eagle.

Thrift Cockburn was tall and shapely, with a round, dimpled face, like a scarlet streaked apple in the Bothwell orchards, and eyes bluer than the \" flower of the flax,\" which she bade her Wat sow.

When the pit's down, your fortune's won.\" \" Do you say so, father!\" replied Thrift with answering gladness, as if she had not heard the same story fifty times ; \" I'm blithe to hear it ; not but I can bear puirtith, but you're growing auld, and Wat will lay aside the plough and ride with his marrows, and wee Wat will grow up to a grand inheritance ; and you shall be honoured as the doer of all and the benefactor of the country-side, never to be lichtlied more. I'm glad that you've sand the seam.\" \" It's no found, lassie,\" interrupted the Laird, hastily ; \" only sure to be ; the metals are the same, and they take the very dip, and I canna be baffled by another hitch. No ! \" said Ringan Cockburn, striking the table with his broad hand, and speaking with a prophet's glowing certainty ; \" the victory's won. I see the hill-"], [250, "238 Days of Yore. head, with the blocks of hard, clean coal \u2014 it's parrot, Thrift, as I'm a living man \u2014 binged house-high, and the train of carts with their Clydesdale mares, and the stout carters bending beneath their load, and whistling and cracking their whips as they drive away to their ten miles distant homes, and the black-a-viced, souple miners swinging in the tubs, and receiving their bright silver groats at the week's end. My word, the Laird of Briary Wood, with its waving holms of wheat and barley, wad fain niffer with the Laird of Watery Butts ; such a hairst he will reap from his peat hags, as Briary Wood and all his generation niver saw. We'll rebuild the old house, Thrift ; we'll have policies and herb gardens and pleasure gardens. Young Wat will get College learning, and sit in the London Parliament, and maintain the rights of Scotland, and counsel King George ; and lassie, I'll lay down my weary banes and dee in peace.\" \" Dinna speak o' deein', father,\" cried Thrift, \" with fortune at the door : gin Wat were but in to hear the news.\" \" They have termed me a fule and a madman, Thrift,\" continued Ringan Cockburn, unheeding her; \"gentle and simple have charged me with wasting your means ; they have said I would bring you to want and misery, and now, with the Lord's will, their children's children will owe me their bread.\" \" The Lord has blessed you, father,\" exclaimed Thrift, devoutly; \" he has given to you to return gude for evil.\" \" He gave me a gude bairn, Thrift,\" responded her father, affectionately, \" that never failed me in my"], [251, "Ringan Cockburn s Trial & Victory. 239 troubles, and that can now rejoice wi' me when my jewel's won.\" \" Father,\" pleaded Thrift, wistfully, \" Wat never said you nay.\" The Laird patted her comely cheek and smiled. \" Wat's a lang-sighted chap, and has a wife and a wean to protect, and he's been patient, forbye eydent; I'm content.\" \" But when will the coal be howkit, and the country side tell'd, and crowns in place of bodies in our purse ? \" demanded Thrift. The Laird looked down reprovingly. \" Bairn, Rome wasna built in ae day \u2014 it's a far cry to Lochawe \u2014 yet it's yonder, Thrift, ayont the blue hills ; I saw it aince, and its wild swans and kilted clans, when I was a laddie, and Rob Roy yet brattled ower the vale of Menteith, and there was word of axes and claymores instead of picks and shools. The pit is not sunk to its last fathom, there maun be gude hire to transform mair hedgers and ditchers into miners and banksmen, and but a cauld coal to blow at in the mean time.\" The Laird reflected. \" Ay, it's never darker than afore dawn.\" Thrift's gleeful face fell, though she strove not to be daunted, and would cling to the bright certainty that had been presented to her, for one moment, to be wrested from her grasp the next. \" It will be but a few shifts mair, father, and when Wat is convinced that success is so nigh \" The Laird's brow contracted. \" Wat's honest, but he is dull, and he grows thrawn, and it is ill to stoop to my younger brither's orphan son.\""], [252, "240 Days of Yore. Oh ! father, dinna blame Wat; he wad work or want for you, ony day ; but he is ower anxious, and he's ill advised,\" pleaded Thrift, faithfully. \" And my arms are stiff, and the day's gone by, when there was no want o' hands to maw the hay, and cut the oats and big the peats for the Maister of Watery Butts ; and my fellows look askant on me at kirk and at market, and hold puir Wat no better than a grieve or a plough man, and wonder at his puir spirit that jowks to my maggots. That's the way o't, Thrift, and sirs, it's high time it were ended.\" A new impulse swayed Thrift ; she threw her arms round her father's neck : \"How daur they, father, how daur they ? \" she sobbed, \" you that were aye ower gude and wise, and never waured a plack on ae sin, and laboured for the weal o' ane and a'. Oh, how can they ? \" The Laird clasped his hands, and looked straight before him with frank pride. \"Ay, Thrift, I showed them how to bore the well at the Pends ; I bade Willie Lums den straw lime on his barren rigs, and this day they bear two-fold. I planted scores o' elms and beeches that ' will grow when we are sleeping,' and wave their green tops when Wat and you are threescore ; I have built a mill, though my red land's no great; I've had neep seed and grass seed frae foreign lands ; the best is but little, but I've done my best \u2014 though I impoverished myself to enrich the beechen bog that's a slough of des pond to this hour ; and the yellow sandstones of my quarry were mauverish as snuff ere they had been months ex posed to sun and wind.\""], [253, "Ringan Cockburn 's Trial & Victory. 241 \" And you have dealt aumouses, father, to the sick and infirm; and you gave your barn to the tramping preacher that Briary Wood and Clay Gates drove off their lands.\" II. \u2014 THRIFT AND WAT IN THEIR STRAITS. The Laird had donned his grey cloak and blue bonnet, and was out in the tempestuous October twilight, plod ding, with bent head, but unrelaxing foot, to the ruddy sire that, like a beacon at sea, burned night and day on one spot on the waste, there to hold his vigiL The summer had been cold and wet, And stuff was unco green. And on the moorlands of Watery Butts the hardy reapers were yet cutting down the crop that, in spite of the Laird's experiments, the winter snow might surprise a field. Wat Cockburn was superintending their labours. Thrift's satellite, Jean, was an out-worker. Thrift was alone at her warm hearth, the windows rattling and the clouds drifting without \u2014 alone save for little Wat, who sat in his corner marshalling flocks and herds of the dry, brown, empty husks of field-peas and knobbed fir-tops. Thrift span and pondered, rose to set the great pot on the kitchen fire, and to mingle and stir its warm whole some mess; but it was not of the tired harvest hands she thought, or even of Wat's coming in cold and hungry from his day's toil. Thrift dwelt upon her father's words with the pertinacity of a temper early imbued with a por tion of the Laird's ardour, and an affection made up of R"], [254, "Days of Yore. 242 respect and protecting fondness. The Laird had been an abstracted, singular, scheming man all his life ; and, in spite of the unselfishness of his motives and actions, and the occasional flashes of good fortune which he caught, he was demurred at by his contemporaries, as men, like water, will love a dead level, and an old chan nel. Thrift knew better. Thrift honoured him far more than if he had been proven worldly-wise, instead of crack-brained. Thrift was fond of him as one is fond of an object peculiarly his own, with wants and weaknesses to be softly covered with a holy mantle. In many respects (whisper it not in the ears of sultans) Thrift was more engrossed with her father than her husband, although she had married Wat from true love, and was a faithful, tender wife, because Wat was independent of her \u2014 Wat was strong, she but his weaker helpmeet. Thrift studied and re-studied her household resources ; she would fain aid her father in his strait, contribute to the remotest chance of his fulfilling his long-proclaimed feat. The peril and precariousness of his undertaking had its own hold on her woman's imagination ; she felt (but probably in a keener degree) like royal Isabella, when she pledged her crown jewels and bestowed the moneys on the voyager Columbus. Blessings on woman's faith ! It may have stranded some deluded barks, but it has also landed many a good ship \u2014 the rudder gone, the hold sprung a leak. But Thrift was sorely puzzled, her means were so very small, and there were holes innu merable for the price of the first sold grain; there were servants' wages, and needful repairs, and groceries, and"], [255, "Ringan Cockburn s Trial & Victory. 243 wearing-apparel, besides old accounts to be looked after. Wat, too, had long disapproved of the Laird's proceed ings, and now it was scarcely to be hoped that, in order to promote them in their extremity, he should again relinquish the better part of his particular earnings, and the capital on which the family depended for all foreign aid during the long winter. Wat was so twitted for facility of temper and weakness of will by his thoughtless, complacent acquaintances, that he might be driven to assert his prerogative to the utmost. At last a project occurred to her, though it was hum ble \u2014 so humble that the little bit of pride in Thrift's warm heart cried out against it, and had to be silenced by the brave doctrine to which she had listened from childhood \u2014 that honest means, however plain and poor, are dignified and graced the moment they are applied to a high end. \" My father and Wat, though Watery Butts and its title deeds have belonged to our forbears sin' the memory of man, have not thought shame to cast their coats mony a day, and slave for me. I will put on my red mantle, and fill my basket with butter, eggs, and young chickens, and hanks of yam, and maybe some napery, and carry it in to the merchants of Ravenston. I haena mony acquaintances to foregather wi', and what need I heed though they say there's the Leddy o' Watery Butts forced, puir woman, to bode away her own gear like ony cadger's wife tramping in wi' her creel? Jean canna be spared, and wad mak no bargain. I see na, though I were a warlock, how else I could earn a penny.\" R 2"], [256, "Days of Yore. 244 Thrift would conceal her simple device from the Laird; she would start in the morning before he was astir, but overnight she must confide it to Wat, and obtain his con sent. She first settled the minuti\u00e6 of her plan, as she spun by her lamp, while Wat read his old newspaper and attended to the horse-suppering, after her father had returned from \" the sinking,\" and partaken of the frugal supper. Jean, leading her male squad of ploughboy and herdboy, had entered, to profit by \" the worship,\" which rose so quaintly and soothingly \u2014 Thrift's clear voice leading the psalm, Wat's deep notes chiming in, Ringan's impressive broken bass uttering lofty verse and reverent prayer. Then, when servants were dismissed ; and Ringan had retired to rest ; and little Wat, with his brown cheek pressed against his pillow, and his chubby hand still grasping his fir-tops, slept the dreamless sleep of infancy ; and Thrift and Wat sat beside their own ingle, and talked in the fearless confidence of man and wife \u2014 Thrift unfolded her little secret, and pleaded her cause with her hand on Wat's knee, and her blue eyes on his face. But Wat's ear had been poisoned, and his heart steeled ; his very love for the speaker hardening him the more against her enterprise. Wat Cockburn was thoroughly frank, manly, and true hearted. He was a handsome fellow, with a warm Gothic tint of complexion and hair, but he had Gothic traits in mind as well as body : he was not bright, he was not deep, he was rather slow, poor fellow, in intellect, though excitable in temper; and like most people who acquire an idea by inches and frequently at second-hand,"], [257, "Ringan Cockburn s Trial & Victory. 245 he was exceedingly hard to dispossess of a notion once imbibed : he was apt to be stubborn. With all sincere regard for the Laird, he had allowed himself to be convinced that the Laird's perpetual draining, planting, building, and boring, was an infatuation which, with his declining finances and the nature of Watery Butts, would land the household in ruin. Now the Laird could do what he chose with his own, but with Wat lay what might be called the executive power exerted on the fields. Besides, when Wat first came to Watery Butts from another county, to introduce himself to his relations, and to be won by and win Thrift, he had sunk his little patrimony on the family property \u2014 and Ringan Cockburn, with all his scheming, was simple and candid as a child in admitting another man's claims, however they might interfere with his consuming pursuit of the phantoms of his busy brain. For the last few months there had been a secret struggle at Watery Butts, almost harder to suffer than open contention, seeing that it was between those who had till now been kith and kin in heart as well as blood. There were stolid opposition and grudging concessions from Wat, and these met by impatience and half scorn and soreness of spirit from the Laird ; \u2014 Wat growing ever more dogged, the Laird more resentful, only Thrift, like a house-pigeon, flying between. Perhaps Wat, manly as he was, had his own unsuspected littleness in the matter of Thrift's enamourment of her father ; at least, it was as his Thrift that he would not hear of her journey to Ravenston, a seller not a buyer; it should never be said that he could not support his wife"], [258, "246 Days of Yore. by the sweat of his brow; or that while Watery Butts was theirs, and he retained the use of his stout hands, she should be driven to such shifts. Thrift in vain reminded him of the country tradition, that Sir Allan's daughter who had wedded a Cockburn in their palmy days, on the temporary forfeiture of their estate during historical reverses, had, then a widow and with daughters, for a time maintained herself and them by plaiting rush mats in a neighbouring cottage. Wat would acknowledge no precedent : there was necessity in their case but none in hers; she might be thankful while he was spared. For the Laird and his maggots, he was a good man, but he was flying in the face of Providence ; it was time he listened to reason. Thrift was keenly mortified and disappointed. She longed to help her father in his need ; she could not bear that Wat should go over to the side of his detractors ; she piqued herself on her influence with Wat, and this was the first time that it had failed since he came amongst them, since they held their trysts where the purple iris and the golden marsh-marigold gave a July splendour to the lonely water stealing across the grey moor. Thrift too remembered sundry rash pledges and doting declara tions into which even sober Wat Cockburn had plunged in the height of his malady, and felt a very ill-used and indignant woman, as she sat with her arms tightly crossed, and her eyes smarting in the firelight, Wat at her side, one great block of cold opposition, yet glancing shyly down at her, and inwardly groaning under the smiting of"], [259, "Ringan Cockburn s Trial & Victory. 247 his conscience. The vanquished do not always bear away the only or the severest wound in the conflict. III. \u2014 THE ACCIDENT AT THE PIT. Thrift, whose humours were wont to be passing vapours, under this provocation both lay down and rose in bitterness. Wat was off ere she awoke, while there was yet a star in the bleak morning sky, to marshal his troop, and to see them whet their sickles before he returned to breakfast. The Laird was abroad, too, early as it was, striding to his Will-o'-the-wisp on the moor \u2014 so com pletely the centre of his aspirations, that if it should be quenched, Thrift felt as if the very lamp of life, that still burnt so brightly in the old student of nature, would leap up and sink in premature darkness. Thrift went sullenly about her household duties, was listless and careless about her usual brisk business. She soundly rebuffed little Wat when he was attacked with a refractory desire to continue dabbling in the water from which he had emerged, in order to proceed with the next stages of his toilette, and sent him shaking with defiant little sobs, to stand with his smeared face turned to the chamber wall. At length breakfast was ready; and catching little Wat by the hand, to drag him from the demon fire, Thrift issued into the raw air, and traversing the little fir wood, which swayed in the morning breeze, she turned her steps to the pit, to summon her father to his morning meal. There was an unusual stir about the working, and Thrift paused on the first knovve to"], [260, "248 Days of Yore. watch the scene. There it lay, so close to her that she could not only distinguish the actors, but hear their words. There were the heaps of hardened, trampled down slaty shale, and limestone surrounding the smoul dering peat fire \u2014 there the black yawning cavity, in which treasures more potent than diamonds might lie buried \u2014 there the rude machine that creaked round and round, dragged by the old grey pony, with his dizzying mechanical pace, and the crick in the neck he seemed to have acquired in his endless circles. The whole had a cheerlessness, and a dismal, crumbling aspect, that seemed to eschew gain, to pertain to disaster and decay, and to agree with the cold October sky, and the flat which it overlooked. But in place of the slouching, lounging figure or two that waited on the ascent of the tub, and emptied its contents, and the one stationary man who contemplated their labours, there was a little knot of excited workmen, remonstrating against the solitary voice of command, which they yet hesitated to disobey. The Laird stood erect and still, extending his arm and giving his orders clearly and distinctly as ever he had done in his life. \" Unyoke the pony, and you, Simon Moys, lead him ower to Clay Gates ; his wind's sair spent, but his back's no broken, and he'll supply the place of the gude grey mare that fell wi' the full cart and broke hir hough-bane last night ; the lave, e'en gang into the gin, and yoke to the trams, and pull shouther to shouther till noon.\" The men looked at each other rebelliously, and then"], [261, "Ringan Cockburn s Trial & Victory. 249 a spokesman came forward a pace, and addressed Ringan Cockbum \u2014 \" It may be neeborlike, Laird, for you to lend a hand to Clay Gates wi' the corn no in, and Martimas nigh,\" he said, grumblingly, but respectfully, as men will respect those who have self-respect written broadly, even in furrows and bleached hair ; \" and I'll say we would be sweer to resist your bidding, for you're a just master and a kind ; and some o' us hae been born and bred on your land ; but to render ourselves brute beasts to plea sure you, and work out your dreams, is mair than ony mortals could accord.\" There was an acquiescent murmur from his com panions, followed by a pause. The Laird lifted his hand to his brow, and then looked in the rough weather-beaten face of the ringleader with bright, unflinching eyes, not a muscle of his own countenance being disturbed. \" Man, Simon,\" he said, simply and composedly, \" yer so far richt, I would be neeborlike in the hairst to Clay Gates, were it in my power, but I am sair straitened for siller ; I'm sending off puir Rory, whose forbear I rode when I was a laddie, no to help Clay Gates, but to bring me a last pound-note or the coal be found.\" The men stirred and stared in blank dismay, and then broke into a unanimous outcry \u2014 \" Gie in, Laird, howk nae deeper ; ye've waured ower muckle already; the day's dead set against you; and you'll never licht a spunk frae that hole.\" But the Laird's voice bore down the clamour, like a bugle call, such a rallying sound was in its dauntless w.rds \u2014 \"Gie in, when the hard battle's fought and"], [262, "Days of Yore. 250 victory won \u2014 the fuel that shall blink on our hearth stanes and gladden them, and raise mair biggins on Watery Butts than there are anns on a barley head ! Doubt Providence, while he's left ae twig to hing on by ! Yer mistae'n, lads ; \" and casting off his coat, Ringan Cockburn laid his own hands on the poles, as if the might of his spirit alone would impel dull wood and rusty iron. The men were shamed for the moment, and inspired with a common reaction. \" Na, Laird,\" they said confusedly, pushing fonvard, \" we'll no fail you now. We'll stick by you anither day, though we be to replace Rory; wha kens but this may be the last bout, and something may be in't?\" And these rude impulsive men pulled round the machine with right good will. At length a faint hollow call, repeated and prolonged, rose from the pit-mouth. Was it, after all, the proclamation of great tidings, \u2014 had the last mine been driven to victory \u2014 the planting of the standard on new fields that were to render unfavoured Watery Butts opulent and famous ? The men tugged and strained till drops started on their toil-worn brows, and a strange fire of kindled expectation glowed in their eyes. The Laird stood firm, with but a tighter contraction of the sagacious lip, and an unconscious lowering of the white eye-brows, but how the great heart within must have panted and prayed ! No tub containing the smallest fragment of the long sought, much-coveted mineral, whether in slaty layers or shining lumps \u2014 but a white scared face, how unlike the harbinger of fortune and thanksgiving\u2014 and a hoarse voice, calling out wildly \" Row, for God's sake, there's"], [263, "Ringan Cockburn' s Trial & Victory. 251 twa forbye me, and the sides o' the mine are cracking like the ice on Cambus Loch.\" The fated words were scarcely uttered, the tottering feet hardly landed, when a hollow rumble, like the roar of surf, a muffled, sharp report, like a volley of musketry, a concussion of the solid earth beneath their feet, fol lowed \u2014 a cloud of dust rising from that great yawning grave, and men's hearts \u2014 quailing, ebbing for a second \u2014 flowing back in a wail of horror and woe. \" Laird, Laird ! \" called Simon Moys, clutching his master by the arm, and confronting him with dire accusa tion in his appalled, wrathful face, \" ye tempted the Lord, wha had gi'en us the braid peat moss and bidden us be content, and his curse has fa'en for your sin on innocent heads.\" Ringan Cockburn spurned the touch, and the red blood returned to his white lips as he shouted for spade and shovel, and clutched the rope hanging over the pit mouth. Much need was there of a leader's presence of mind, of immediate, vigorous action ; for, work as their comrades might, with the strength of brotherhood yearn ing over their fate \u2014 let the whole country-side be arrested to relieve their strenuous exertions, it would be mirk night before these human bodies could be drawn from the pile of sand and stones heaped high above the rock, where they struck their picks, living men that morning. Women, with their fluttering gowns and shawls, were appearing in many a meandering line across the moor, trudging to the work with their pitchers and baskets, conveying breakfasts to husbands and sons terribly"], [264, "Days of Yore. 252 engaged. At the first suspicion of the evil, they flocked in, tossing their arms and screaming in sore distress. For, who were the sufferers ? What wretched wife or mother was to find her own in that buried pair, gone forth from them in strength and security \u2014 to win their bread \u2014 to shelter and cherish them \u2014 to be praised or abused, never more ? Lawrie Blair, the wild but good-natured prodigal, whom the Laird had so often forgiven, the sole support of the fractious, ailing mother, who was continually bemoaning his sins, and who had not walked half the distance for years, already apprised of the calamity, now stumbled along, her feeble hands twitching at her neckerchief, or check apron. \"Oh, Lawrie, Lawrie, ha'e ye come to this; Laird, Laird, save the lad that wad ha'e deed for ye afore the doucest an' decentest man in your employ, \u2014 that has deed for you ! Wae's me, wae's me ! Had ye lived but a ditcher, my bairn, like your faither afore you, ye wad ha'e been to the fore through mony anither spree.\" Thrift took her by the hand and found a seat for her on the grass, and tried to tell her to take heart, for Lawrie was in the Lord's hand, even in that overwhelmed pit, and that he had been found at his post of duty, though it was but a miner's shift IV. \u2014 THE MEN ARE SAVED AND THE \" COAL IS WON.\" A murmur was spreading among the workers, para lyzing their efforts; there were glances of far deeper"], [265, "Ringan Cockburn s Trial & Victory. 253 commiseration and distress shot round ; Simon Moys again stood out, and taking-off his cap, communicated something reluctantly and hesitatingly to the Laird. Ringan Cockburn staggered, and looked up piteously to the leaden sky. No \u2014 no. It could not be ! \"Father,\" said Thrift, joining him, and suddenly aware of a strange overlook, \" why is Wat not here ? Send him and the bandsters word ; they'll take their turn wi' the miners. Wat will do the work of two men, aye, however grieved he may be to see this sight.\" \"Let alane, Thrift, my woman,\" replied the Laird, weakly. \" Wat's housing the sheaves, and he could do no gude here ; you see there's no room for the folk already. There's relays upon relays : let a' be.\" \" Housing the sheaves when men's lives are to save ! \" Thrift remonstrated indignantly. \" Father, ye dinna ken what you say, or how sair ye wrang Wat. I'll run for him myself.\" \" Bide still, Thrift ; bide here, I command you,\" the Laird exclaimed, violently. Thrift was thunderstruck ; she looked at her father, shaking in every limb, his fine tranquil face working with emotion. She caught the glances of the others, now turned from Tib Blair, sitting rocking herself on the moor, all directed to herself with the same inexpressible gentleness and solemnity beaming so strangely from those familiar, homely faces. The truth gleamed upon her, the awful fact that Wat, vexed by her pain and resentment, had risen from his bed ; and, as if possessed by a dark fate, had gone where he had not been for weeks, to the pit-head ; and, before the"], [266, "Days of Yore. 254 main portion of the workmen assembled, had borrowed a miner's tools and descended the shaft \u2014 either seized with a wild superstitious notion of trying his individual luck in the costly and condemned speculation \u2014 or with a calmer purpose of attempting to satisfy himself by actual eyesight, whether it held out the least glimmering of the result on which the Laird yet pinned his faith. Stiff and stark, or uttering stifled groans of mortal anguish, fathoms beneath their feet, crushed and con cealed in a living grave, with the clods and stones heaped on his uncoffined, unshrouded breast, lay comely, kind Wat Cockburn, in the flush and promise of his manhood. Thrift's blue eyes glared upon the witnesses, her white cheek grew a purple red, and she dropped down at her father's feet, clasping his knees, and writhing before him : \" Gi'e me back Wat, father ; I gave you all else, the bite from my baimie's mouth, but no Wat, never Wat 1\" Oh, hapless king of Israel, who rent thy royal robe at the mocking mandate of the imperious Syrian, here is a man more tortured and abased, as if he too were \" a god to kill and to make alive ; \" and one of the wretched suppliants his pleasant child, Thrift, a young bride three twelvemonths back. Not sorrow alone, but remorse, is cankering and maddening the cordial, happy nature, convulsing and transforming each feature as if an evil spirit had pos sessed itself of the fair body. \" Oh, Tib Blair, ye ha'e flyted on Lawrie mony a day, but ye parted friends at last; I tell you a' standing there, I gloomed on my Wat, my gude, sober, kind gudeman,"], [267, "Ringan Cockburn s Trial & Victory. 255 I, an ill wife, braggit him till, against his better judgment, he gaed down the pit, and met his death this day.\" Yes, this will be the fearful burden of Thrift's sad widowhood, the blight that will alight upon her this moment, and haunt her sunk, searching eyes until her dying moment, be it near or far \u2014 her hair will not have one or two slight threads, but whole flakes of silver breaking its brown before the October day be done, and she but a matron of twenty-five ; for there had been discord between her and Wat Cockburn on that last even, in the cheerful light of their quiet hearth ; and he had risen and gone out of his house in the grey morning, without one word of reconciliation and reviving regard exchanged between them. Thrift's first paroxysm of despair soon sunk in exhaus tion, and with hands and heart cold and heavy as lead, she sat as still as Tib Blair. Another hand led away the innocent, ignorant, daunted child, or forced refresh ment upon the Laird. Now that he was gone, taken from her so suddenly and fearfully, Thrift cared for none but Wat Cockburn. Many a strong arm that had dug with grim application gave way; the shades of evening fell chill on these wastes; by the red smoky light of lanterns, the Laird looked haggard and aged as some patriarch \u2014 God-for saken like Job \u2014 before there was a halt, a shout, and a signal that the lost were found. The men clustered together, forming an agitated ring ; the women hid their faces, and sobbed anew with bitter violence. A board had been fixed above the ordinary"], [268, "256 Days of Yore. tub, and upon it a man was ascending, with a dark mass resting at his feet ; slowly and cautiously they wound the rope until they were almost on a level with the bystanders. The lights fell on a great crimson stain, and every breath in the circle was drawn hard and short. \" There's life in him yet ; but hide him frae his mither.\" Life ! what a power there is in that sound, though it be but a vapour fluttering in its flight, expiring in fitful, tortured flashes. Life ! how the name alone can heal the broken heart, and revive energies, strange and wonderful as humanity can display. Tib Blair rose up strengthened, and followed on her own feet the shapeless, bruised form. Was not her Lawrie still in life, and might not a merciful Providence spare him, maimed and help less, for her, his old mother, to tend and succour \u2014 for whom her feeble fingers could spin day and night \u2014 to whom she would never again give crabbed, spiteful answers ? A wild imagination, but still a ray of hope to lighten the miserere of the bereaved heart. And how Thrift Cockburn coveted that poor burden, and what would she not have given to have received her Wat thus ! Another interval of suspense, brief, but to those who endure it a very life-time, sickening, heart-rending : a few more shovels-ful thrown from the hill of stony mould which never seemed to decline \u2014 and the second watched for token that their weary task was ended. Thrift would not be kept back by any force, but she stood still, rigid rather, in the centre of the group.

I. NELLV. T HAVE two old pictures to show you, or rather the double panels of one old picture. It is not of a very distant date either. Old familiar figures were moving off the stage then ; Dr. Johnson, that noble bear, and Sir Joshua, the cock sparrow, had passed away. But Queen Charlotte, with her snuff and her large unruly family ; and Fanny D'Arblay, with her stories of court life, and her love-marriage with a noble emigrant in a farm-house, still held their ground. But I have nothing to do with them ; nor with the French Revolution, nor the Irish Rebellion, nor the decline and disappearance of cocked hats and hair powder. They are not in my way at pre sent, though doubtless cocked hats and hair powder were worn on great occasions by the jolly lairds and farmers who used to drop in, at the old village Brewery, when passing. The Brewery stood in near neighbourhood to that prettiest, \" cantiest and couthiest\" of rural spectacles, a meal mill. \" Meal and maut ! \" they were herein most agreeable and suggestive juxtaposition ; and in the old S 2"], [272, "Days of Yore. 260 days of water-wheels they were of course manufactured on the bank of a brawling stream or burn with its fringe of hazels and rowans. Cocks, hens, and pigeons, spangled with blue and crimson necks \u2014 birds sufficient to have pleased the bird-loving heart of the old minnesanger \u2014 affected the place ; for many a corn of wheat and barley but half emptied, and groat and grain of meal were to be had there for the up-picking. In the rooms of the old Brewery there was \" maut \" in all its stages. In one low brown room, barrels stood ranged, and there were spigots and horns ready for tasting. This room opened conveniently into the Brewer's two-storied house, grown over with a cherry-tree, and planted within a stone's throw of the road-side. The Brewer, therefore, was seldom far from home either way \u2014 from the Brewery, or from his dwelling-house. His customers \u2014 the small gentry and yeomen \u2014 drouthy cus tomers, but harmlessly drouthy in this instance \u2014 never failed to give him a call in passing, leaving their horses fastened by the bridle in the rusty ring at the side of the \" louping-on stane \" by the door. There they would try his last browst, refreshing themselves with cool draughts from the homs, and w_th the last news, public or private \u2014 the last gossip of the town or the country that had reached the Brewery. So they rested. The Brewery was a great place for news. With the soberer of the newsmongers it out-did the bar, or even the smithy, or the little stationer's shop in the next town. There, indeed, as one could fancy, the gossip would be more of a literary cast, just as at the church-door it was more of an agricultural cast."], [273, "Two Panels from an old Picture. _6 r The Brewery was an attractive place, with its deep umber-toned earthen floor, and its plump casks with their amber liquid; its long shadows, and its cool delicious tints. The Flemish-looking figures of portly purple flushed men in riding-boots and coats, and sometimes with scarlet camlet cloaks and beavers, like those of their wives and daughters, and silver-headed whips and great silver spurs, added a picturesque glow as they sat easily accommodated on the ends of benches, or on the tops of empty casks, or in one of the two elbow chairs at the single little deal table. Cheery they were, but never outrageous, for it was nappy ale, not fiery whisky. And all this was finely relieved by the scene at the open door\u2014 the pawing horses venturing an occasional neigh, the pecking, scraping white hens and red-crested cocks, and the great tortoise-shell cat which prowled about stealthily after them \u2014 by the murmuring burn, blue over its slaty bed, and the rustling green bushes. At the period to which I refer there was yet another and more striking object of relief to the eye in the tasting room of the Brewery. The Brewer's wife was a douce woman, who never dreamt of wearing her real lace borders save on Sundays and holidays. On ordinary occasions she wore instead a high, thick white wall of bolted muslin round her face. But she had fallen ill, and now no longer able to order about her maid-servant, to hail the visitors affably, or chat briskly to them, or put her lips courteously to those black, ever-frothing, never-empty horns, to do honour to her husband's best customers. She was not even able to carry her keys in her great patched"], [274, "262 Days of Yore. pockets ; but was doomed to lie back helplessly in her blue and white easy chair, while her house went to \"sixes and sevens\" for want of a genteel, sensible woman body at its head. In this strait \u2014 when the Brewer could not possibly take a second wife, the first being still in the body \u2014 the Brewer bethought himself of begging the loan of a niece from a many-childed sister's family, to help them till her aunt was on foot again. This family resided in another county, then reckoned so remote that it might have been another country. At that time girls were pressed into women's duties without fear or hesitation, and did not discharge them so badly. So Nelly was sent for, and \u2014 after many days' weary ride on a pillion, which she long remembered \u2014 Nelly was duly installed in the mistress's seat at the Brewery. Nelly had never been from home before. She was barely sixteen, a lovely, clever, sweet-tempered girl, and was regarded as a miracle of abilities and accomplishments by her simple, substantial relatives, who were a great deal farther from the metropolis of Auld Reekie than Nelly's father and mother, and a great deal more primi tive in their habits and ideas. Nelly gave the most un bounded satisfaction, and in return she was fond of her sluggish, homely, affectionate old kinsfolk. Besides other reasons Nelly had for liking the Brewery, there was this one. She was a sort of ph\u0153nix to the Brewer and his wife, while at home she was only a bonnie, active lass, among five or six nearly as bonnie active lasses. I suspect Nelly had a craving, not so much for admiration perhaps as for approbation \u2014 the sweet touching weakness of sweet"], [275, "Two Panels front an old Picture. 263 loving tempers. The Brewer and his ailing partner petted Nelly, indulged her, brought her forward, and dwelt upon her merits in the most innocent and exulting fashion. I believe they would have fed her on lump sugar \u2014 a luxury with them \u2014 as though she had been a little canary bird. The first thing that awaited her after she had opened her pretty eyes in the morning, was a glass of sweet milk stirred up with honey to strengthen her, as they said. Now the gallant Frenchman, with his \" sweetest to the sweetest,\" inscribed in flourishing letters on a scroll and wrapped round a bouquet of violets presented with a low bow to his mistress, was all very well in his way, and might hope to have his offering accepted; but with all Nelly's most obliging humour this last accumulation of sweetness was a thought too cloying. One of Nelly's feats was to read aloud the newspapers, which she did in a style that had not been witnessed before at the Brewery ; she did it with such clearness, such intelligibility, unbroken by the least difficulty or hesitation, that only the minister or the dominie could have equalled it. The Brewer rather preferred Nelly, and I agree with him. When the Brewer discovered this new distinguished talent on Nelly's part, he could not keep it to himself, and partly to show off Nelly, partly as a benefit to his customers, he arranged that Nelly should read the paper aloud to them in the tasting-room. Thei e was only one paper, a high Tory organ, known at the Brewery at the time. When it arrived, Nelly, be assured, was nothing loth. She was vain, poor child; but it was a single-hearted child's vanity, delighted at affording"], [276, "264 Days of Yore. pleasure, and elated at the thought of being looked up to as an oracle. So Nelly sits in state ; her throne for the nonce one of the arm-chairs of the brown rich-toned old Brewery. Nelly, delicate as a fairy, looked all the fairer for such sur roundings. She was so fair and sweet, indeed, that her beauty and her sweetness of temper are the most vivid remembrances that linger of her among her descendants. She was a fine picture after dinner, in her chintz gown, drawn through the pocket-holes, her busk, her crossed kerchief, her little knots of primrose or cherry-coloured ribbon fluttering about her, her black mittens over her round slender arms and chubby hands, her little shoes with their buckles, and her dark curls in one imposing row on her crown. There she sits, holding the news paper, and reading in her silver voice and quaint pro vincial accent news about the peace with America, descriptions of the Indian marches of my Lord Cornwallis, reports of the terrible misrule, riot, and bloodshed across the Channel, accounts of the great flood in this or that haugh, and the last exciting match in the metro politan cock-pit The clumsy but picturesque listeners sat open-mouthed in admiration, and breathless with attention, unless at some stop, when they would break out in hoarse, tumultuous applause, imd loud exclamations of delight. Men were more downright and demonstrative in those days than they are in these. No wonder little Nelly loved her task. It was like being a queen, without the burden and uneasiness of crown and sceptre. She was a heroine ; but on a safe,"], [277, "Two Panels from an old Picture. 265 home stage. I feel sorry to quit Nelly, passing to and fro, and swaying that rough audience of lairds and yeomen. I protest she strikes me as being one of the prettiest and most innocent enchantresses I ever saw. But, as I look, a big handsome, manly, simple young fellow appears among the company more and more fre quently, lingers longer, and gradually gets nearer the chair of the performer, disturbing her, simple as she is, and causing her to falter and giggle, much to the Brewer's mortification. Then suddenly the couple vanished from the Brewery, with all the unexpected and uncalled-for suddenness with which couples vanished in those days. Consulting com petent authorities, I find that Nelly eloped with young Harry one moonlit harvest night. There was no cause for such a proceeding, since the relations of both houses were perfectly agreeable to the match. The only cause lay in the impatience of Harry, and that yielding sweet ness of Nelly which made her so prone to say Yes, and give pleasure at any cost The relations of such couples usually took these silly elopements as frolics, which saved at least more elaborate and expensive wedding-feasts. All that was deemed worth recording with regard to this one was, that the combined ages of Harry and Nelly, and the mare on which they rode away in the mellow moonlight \u2014 her arm round his waist, his ruddy face turned to meet her smooth peach cheek \u2014 did not amount to forty years. The Brewery did not lose its customers ; those green coated, red-vested lairds and yeoman, came still, punc tually as ever, trotting to and from trysts. But the"], [278, "266 Days of Yore. pretty central figure was gone, and the groups were heavier and more monotonous. The scene had still the green of summer and the white of winter in the open-air world without; but the want of that one little graceful, glowing, gladsome figure within, was a grievous loss to those who had learnt to prize it. ii. \u2014 Moll. In our day, when so much is said of the cultivation of women, and their social standing and influence, it may be forgotten that last century some women were pro minent and potent magnates. Such was Moll the sister of Nelly, in days long after that newspaper-reading in the old Brewery. Indeed, while Nelly's public fascinations culminated in her tender maidenhood, and only stretched out thence in softened shaded beams, Moll's glory was a late effulgence which broadened almost to its setting. Moll was one of those superior, managing women, whose husbands seem by necessity to be nonentities. For what would be the use of another head, to think, to scheme, and to execute, when such a one as Moll's, both fruitful and practical, was there already? There are drawbacks in such cases which the poor man cannot remove \u2014 because of the very eminence of his good fortune. He cannot remove them, or if he tries he signally fails, like John Grumlie. He must ever dwindle into a nonentity, unless \u2014 and more dismally still \u2014 he sink into a sot. But while the husband is apt to be crushed by the very"], [279, "Two Panels from an old Picture. 267 business talents of his spouse, just as the Roman girl was by the Sabine soldiers' bracelets, the wife is likely to be very fresh, piquant, and dazzling to other men, whose wives in fretful jealousy significantly wish their mates only knew her better, or could change places for a year with her poor, hen-pecked, down-trodden husband. The men, not contemplating such a dangerous experi ment as this, shut their eyes and ears, and enjoy a fine, liberal, clear-headed, sharp-tongued, masculine-minded, ardent woman like Moll. She can sympathise with them in their pursuits, always retaining the sparkle, flavour, and novelty of her individuality. She figures to them as a most superior woman, sensible and judicious \u2014 a capital companion. Of course Moll soon took her husband's business out of his relaxing fingers. It happened to be a town busi ness, that of a wood merchant and cabinet maker, and she conducted it with great zeal, giving abundant evidence of parts. Yet though Moll could marshal and direct joiners and carvers, buy lots of wood, receive commis sions, and sit at a desk and pay wages like an ingenious ready-minded man, there was something she always failed in, perhaps in that very outstanding feature in the intel lect of even a slow man : she never made money. There was a hole in her sieve \u2014 a line, it seemed the chief one, torn from her ballad. She was an enterprising woman \u2014 a woman with extraordinary invention, foresight, and calculation \u2014 but she wanted ballast. She could not ride the waves of the common voyage of life, \u2014 she never reached a haven of prosperity, \u2014 she was from first to"], [280, "268 Days of Yore. last cleverly tacking and doubling, and getting locked among reefs of difficulties. Moll was a fine-looking woman indeed ; she could scarcely have been Nelly's sister had she been otherwise. But it was beauty of a totally different type from Nelly's. Moll's countenance was bold and masculine, though lively and attractive. She wore a hair cap, which rose in a peak like a helmet ; and above it again a small black mode scoop, pinned down at each side of her head with two large gold pins, so determinedly thrust through, that you recoiled from the notion that they actually pierced through her head, and that she was such an Amazon as never to acknowledge the wound. Ladies who do work or attend to shops now-a-days wear grey working cloaks and sober grey gowns. With a higher sense of the im portance of their persons, or the dignity of their calling, the ladies of former days were wont to rustle in silks and brocades, and find them no encumbrance. Moll sailed about in such rich attire. A more nobly-draped, magni ficently-adorned figure of a woman was not to be seen, nor was there one who was apparently more indifferent to dress, or rose more freely above it by native force of intellect. Moll's chief station, both for business and relaxation, was at her shop door, or on the pavement in front of her shop. There she stood with her hands in her pockets, discussing politics and prices with contemporary trades men, giving and receiving pinches of snuff from her own chased gilt box, or from the less ambitious mulls of others. A chat with Moll was the agreeable stimulant"], [281, "Two Panels from an old Picture. 269 and tonic to the wit of the town. It was no unusal thing to see Moll of a morning sunning herself; a knot of men around her, like Nelly in the old days of the Brewery ; but in place of merely reading for their benefit, Moll encountered them on their own ground. Sometimes she would so skilfully ply her arms \u2014 lunge and parry \u2014 that she sent away many a combatant temporarily dis comfited and with a flea in his ear, to the great delight of his companions. Moll never went into company where gentlemen did not show themselves. As, however, she was a perfectly respectable woman, she visited her friends freely in their own houses and tolerated the presence of their wives. She was partial to little social suppers after the shop was shut \u2014 travesties of the brilliant hilarious oyster suppers of Edinburgh and Dublin \u2014 to which some other woman was invited, for form's sake, to sit beside Moll in the party of men. I have said Moll's inventive powers were considerable. Some of her attempts partook even of the inspiration of genius. They say that long before Millar launched his little steamboat on the pond at Dalswinton, she bruised her fingers labouring to carve out of wood a rude model of her conception of paddle-wheels ; and that when the stubborn material baffled her unskilful fingers, she tried the model anew in more yielding slices of turnip. In her family Moll had all the sternness and humour of an astute stranger. She had one gifted son and one gentle, beautiful daughter among the number, and to them she was womanly and tender. But when they faded"], [282, "Days of Yore. 270 from her grasp, \u2014 and not all Moll's spirit and sagacity could stay them, \u2014 she said, with more discrimination than forbearance, of the others, whose faults were in some measure confirmed by her neglect, that only \" the rags \" of her family was left her; and she treated these rags to her protection and her good-natured contempt. Moll got more restless and eccentric as age, and sorer crosses than age, met her. She became more and more unable to cope with her comrades, or to wrestle with her troubles. She then had recourse to her friends to back her in her devices ; and, relying on their admiration and indulgence, overwhelmed the simple, contented couple, Harry and Nelly, with her wonderful talents and extrava gances, picking their pockets to carry out her ideas, and heartily despising them all the time. At last infirmity and disease prostrated even Moll's defiant spirit. Her schemes were perforce laid aside, or relinquished to others, and the end of this meteor among women came as the end of some quiet twinkling star. After life's fitful fever, which beat so full in her veins \u2014 \u25a0 after her contradictory, combative, but constantly checked career \u2014 Moll sleeps soundly in a quiet village churchyard among the mountains."], [283, "TWOFOLD.

She has got the better of it, but it has left a weakness behind it \u2014 a weakness falling and settling down upon that old troublesome place, the spine.

He was a brusque fellow to speak to ; in her own language she called him \" a fine mon.\" He toiled among the poor day by day ; he felt for them, and was kindly remembered by them.

He had on a moment's notice married again, after his sons and daughters were grown up, a woman thirty years younger than himself, yet still no girl \u2014 a woman without rank or wealth or even beauty \u2014 a woman of the home liest education and antecedents \u2014 a ruddy, stout, mature woman, his first wife's housemaid, whom he took as much by surprise as everybody else when he removed her from her state of servitude and placed her at the head of his establishment What whim or spell had possessed Mr. Auchterlonie no one knew, or was likely to know, for he was a retired taciturn man. If ever well-endowed elderly gentleman deserved to be put under restraint for an outrageous act, it was Mr. Auchter lonie. But as there is no law to tie up elderly gentlemen who meditate unaccountable marriages, this marriage was accomplished, the only member of the family on the spot to have petitioned and entered interdicts being his daughter Katie. Mr. Auchterlonie had formally informed his sons of his purpose, without giving any explanation ; indeed, he had not been accustomed to tell his children of his motives for doing this or that. He had taken care that the step should be taken when both the young men were"], [292, "Days of Yore. 280 abroad, \u2014 Davie spending a vacation with Sandy in the rare delights of an Eastern expedition. Thus the lads had no opportunity to walk in and overturn their father's matrimonial arrangements ; there was only Katie to prevent it. Poor Katie ! But she was not to be pitied after all, even under this heavy trial, she was so healthy and happy. The family temperament might be said to have taken a new turn, so that the force which came out so rugged in the father and sons, was in her a purely sweet and sunny temper, sensible, full of enjoyment, and affectionate, without morbidness and without moodiness, possessing a large amount of moral courage and an endurableness of character which might wear out strong savage men. For all that, Katie half cried her eyes out the night her father told her, in half-a-dozen abrupt sentences, that he was going to marry Beenie Tosh. She began to look out and pack up her effects, and to wander about taking farewell of her dear old home of Whiteford ; for her father had said that she might go and live with her mother's relations. \" You may go if you like, Katie ; only remember, if you do go, it is for good and all.\" Yes, she would go ; she would brave the alternative, and so she proceeded to pack up and say good-bye. Then, with so true a nature, reaction of course set in, sure and swift. After a bitter struggle and a sore battle with herself, she yielded to much that was cruelly antagonistic to her lively spirit; and seeing plainly her misfortune, she accepted it, and consented to the darkening of her prospects and the closing-in of her bright social life."], [293, "The Second Mrs. Auchterlonie. 281 Katie might be right, or she might be wrong, but she was disinterested. Her attached eager aunts, who would have encouraged any display of indignation on her part, and welcomed her to their houses, thought less of her from that day. They thought her time-serving and timid, not their poor sister's very daughter. Thus she became something of a heroine. \" If I go away,\" she said to her- self with a crimson face, \" the world may say scandalous things of papa, and I won't have him abused; he has been a manly, righteous, refined gentleman, a benevolent Christian gentleman. He never crossed me, though he never petted me much ; he bore with my laughter, some- times he laughed with me. I was always sure he loved me, as sure of his love as of Davie's and Sandy's, when they were imperious and scolded me. I never doubted any one of them. He will keep his word. If I leave Whiteford I would never cross the door again, or sit by his pillow and kiss hit - when he came to die.\" \" If I go away,\" she said agal 1, \" there will be no chance of Davie's and Sandy's coming back ; the rupture will be complete, for I know the boys will never care about touching a farthing of papa's money; I believe they will not mind working for themselves, and he will not have one child left. If I go away, the whole neighbourhood will forsake papa ; and if his own child desert him, that will be setting everybody an example to turn their backs upon him. They have no right to do that,\" exclaimed the girl, getting up and walking in magnanimous discom posure and vehemence to and fro in her room. \" Papa is not about to commit a deadly sin ; some of themselves"], [294, "282 Days of Yore. have done more unwarrantable things. Even towards her it is unreasonable, unfair. What is she that they should shrink from her ? What is she that she should defile me since papa chooses her to sit in mamma's place ? Poor Beenie ! who always met me first when I came home from school, to whom I gave the largest Christmas-box, who doctored my sprained ankle better than the doctor himself, and who was so proud when she helped to sew and to fit on my first ball-dress,\" and Katie ended with a burst of tears. No ; Beenie's undue exaltation was not Beenie's fault. By no immodest scheming, by iro vaulting ambition, had she attained it. Katie was convinced of that. Why was Mr. Auchterlonie guilty of the glaring inconsistency? But he being guilty, Beenie could not be justly blamed unless for not refusing the honour put upon her ; and that was to expect a degree of wisdom and self-control not more common in elderly housemaids than in the rest of the world. Katie was not certain \u2014 though the incon gruity would not have been so great in that case \u2014 that she herself would have had the strength of mind to refuse a real English duke if he had solicited her to become a duchess and to be picked to death by all the other duchesses. \" Besides \" \u2014 Katie finished with a twist of her mouth, a comical idea shooting across her distress, as the sun's rays will gleam athwart dank watery vapours \u2014 \" Beenie dared not refuse papa, she has always stood in such wholesome awe of ' the Master.' Poor Beenie 1 \""], [295, "The Second Mrs. A uchterlonie. 283 II. \u2014 KATIE'S DEFENCE OF MR. AUCHTERLONIE. On a fine August day the two brothers Davie and Sandy arrived at Whiteford. They had travelled almost all night and day since receiving the intimation of their father's set purpose \u2014 not with the hope of stopping its consummation, for that was impossible \u2014 but, as Sandy puffed out, to get rid of their steam, and to rescue Katie. They were travel-stained and dishevelled as they stood before the red-brick house, which was warm and cosy, hung round with white jasmine, yellow rose-Japonica, and a profusion of common China roses, and the great leaves of the Canadian vines. Within the policy were the hay-field, and patches of Indian corn, carrots, and beetroot (Mr. Auch terlonie being an amateur agriculturist) ; on the outskirts were shrubs, fancy laurels, acacias, araucarias, and sweet British lilacs and laburnums, as well as borders of daisies, and tufts of heather, \u2014 and the whole place was basking drowsily in the thick-moted beams of August sunshine. But the place was very un-homelike to them this summer day. The one had not been here for nine months, and the other for three ; yet in place of hastening in-doors, they, by mutual instinct, stopped and rang the bell. Their two dogs, Punch and Judy, ran to them with much leaping and barking, but they knocked them off, sternly. They did not acknowledge the new servant, although they knew her as having been brought up in the parish ; accordingly, they asked for Mr. Auchterlonie. \" My father,\" added Davie, as if he felt he was acting a part in a play. Was he at home, and could they see him ?"], [296, "284 Days of Yore. Beenie's successor was greatly excited, but she had the presence of mind to inform the applicants that Mr. Auchterlonie was not at home. He had driven over early in the morning to the train, she believed ; and she added, in confidential accents (for which Davie and Sandy would have given the girl her dismissal on the spot had they been her masters), \" he was gone for twa'ree days or the hale week to a grand meeting\" (the Highland Society's, or the Antiquarian, or the Social Science, thought the brothers) ; \"at least, so she had heard said by the mistress.\" Sandy ground his teeth. This accident vexed him, for he might have to rejoin his ship before he could have his difference out with his father. But he said aloud, \"Never mind. Tell Miss Auchterlonie she is wanted to speak to her brothers for a few moments ;\" and, at the risk of encountering his father's wife, he pushed past the girl and walked through the hall to the pretty drawing-room \u2014 faded since it had been fitted up for their own mother, but still pretty \u2014 with its old-fashioned blue-lined chintz draperies framing the bushes and cornfields without. Here and there lay Katie's nicknacks \u2014 her drawings, her work basket, her bird-cage, her books. There was only one token of another's company, and it was not very objection able. It was a fine half-knitted worsted stocking on slim wires ; and fastened to it was one of those little bunches of hens' feathers which one sees along with pieces of knitting on kitchen and cottage tables. Sandy's eye caught it, and he turned up his nose still higher as he and Davie sat down, in their dust and fume, on one of the finical chintz couches."], [297, "The Second Mrs. Auchterlonie. 285 Davie and Sandy knew that room well. It was their resting-place on winter evenings, where they condescended to listen to Katie's music occasionally, or read with a lion's share of the lamp \u2014 where they had intended to recouut their adventures to an impressed audience this autumn, but where they now sat still and stiff, as if death were in the house. There was some fun in the proceeding, inasmuch as Sandy and Davie, who were in such wrath at their father's slight to established rules, were in their own persons no torious despisers of forms, and were as unmannerly and bearish as two young gentlemen, the sons of a gentleman, could contrive to be. With what grace, therefore, they could sit there and swell at their father's indifference to public opinion and his assertion of primitive rights, the reader can easily guess. After five minutes' rest, which was a benefit to the young men's exhausted bodies, but no sedative to their tempers, Katie came running in \u2014 a light, firm, well-made, comely faced girl, with so clear a forehead, so reasonable an eye, and so benevolent a mouth, that she was a beauty. And yet her features were nothing to speak of; her complexion was freckled, and her hair neither chestnut nor aubum nor tawny, but undeniably red \u2014 so red that a crimson rose in it would have been positively frightful. Still she was a beauty, one in a thousand, fair already, and to become always fairer, with her beautiful brow and her beautiful dimples. Katie came running in, in her blue muslin and her snow-white sun-bonnet, which she pre ferred to a hat"], [298, "286 Days of Yore. \" Oh ! dear, dear boys, I cannot tell how glad I am to see you home again. When did you come ? \u2014 and where have you been last ? \u2014 and had you my letters ? \u2014 and will you have something to eat and drink?\" This after she had hugged them both closely. \" Where have you been, Katie, keeping us so long in this den?\" grumbled both the brothers fractiously, kissing her at the same time, and allowing her to kiss them with a kind of gruff sufferance. \"Den !\" exclaimed Katie,looking around her. \"I think it is a very nice room ; I see none like it. I was out, of course, this fine afternoon ; we took an early dinner, and I was down at the bleaching-green with \u2014 with Mrs. Auchterlonie,\" Katie got out with an inevitable red face and a disposition of the name to stick in her throat. \" How dared you, Katie,\" raged Sandy, charging upon her at once ; \" what do you mean by keeping company with that woman ? \" \"How could I help it, Sandy?\" Katie defended herself. \" Why should I not keep company with her, now that she is papa's wife?\" she went on more calmly. \" The very reason you should never speak to her, never let your eyes fall upon her.\" \" She never did me any ill,\" protested Katie ; \" and this was papa's will \u2014 am I not to respect my father?\" \" Katie,\" interposed Davie decidedly, \" how long will you take to get ready to go with us to Aunt Leyden's ? \" \"Oh 1 Davie, I can't,\" objected Katie, piteously. \"It is very kind of you, Sandy ; I know you mean it for kindness, but I can't leave the house when papa is away"], [299, "The Second Mrs. Auchterlonie. 287 \u2014 to steal a march upon him as it were, and turn my back upon her after I have taken her up.

Davie, Sandy, I can't do it.\" \" I never thought you were so childish, so greedy,\" Davie accused her. \"I never heard such idiocy,\" proclaimed Sandy. \"What call have you to support the woman ? No body \u2014 not even my father \u2014 could ask it of you. No ; he has made his choice, leave him to it. You will be giving that woman a hand at the washing-tub next; I wonder at you, Katie.\" \"Katie,\" remonstrated Davie, \"we cannot see you sacrificed. You do not understand. Nobody will look near you ; the whole neighbourhood will shun you; you will be classed with him and her ; you will lose caste, Katie ; you will deteriorate by grubbing among her low ways, and her low relations.\" \" She has never brought a relation to the house,\" ex plained Katie ; \" she tries to accommodate herself to our ways, poor woman ! See, she is knitting that pretty stock ing for me. Surely, refinement is little worth if it cannot match with homeliness. Then, papa is cultivated enough to inoculate us all with cultivation. I am not frightened.\" \" No matter, Katie,\" contradicted her brother angrily ; \" the world won't judge so, and it will put you out of society as it will put them out.\" \"The more shame to them,\" said Katie warmly ; \"what right have they to judge ? Davie, you forget,\" said the"], [300, "Days of Yore. 288 generous girl, standing erect in womanly dignity, though her face was a deep red, \" my father's wife is an honest woman. No, I will not forsake her.\" \" You pay a small compliment to your own mother,\" reflected Sandy, bitterly. \" No, I don't, Sandy \u2014 I don't,\" cried Katie sharply, as if he had struck her a blow. \" And, Sandy,\" continued the baited girl, with a quivering lip, \" the last words mamma said to me were, ' Be a good girl, Katie, and do everything your father bids you.' \" \" And so, I suppose you would cut your throat at his word ? \" sneered Davie. \" No ; but you know well papa would never ask me to do anything that was really wrong. I did not think you two cared so much for the opinion of the world,\" added Katie, with innocent eras' iness. \"You went little into company yhen you were at home, and you were always angry at _ne when I went to a dance or a picnic. A set of stupid, silly folks you said the neighbours were, who did not really care about us, though you cared sufficiently for them to help them in serious trouble. They have not cut me completely; they have been a little shy, but the Lindesays and Andersons have been inviting me, and Patricia Lindesay came round to me at church yesterday, and told me she would come over as usual, if I would like it ; and what do you think, Colonel Fordyce called to see papa on justice business, and brought his wife with him \u2014 she who had never leisure to notice us before, on account of her great circle of connections through the Elliot-Oswald family.\""], [301, "The Second Mrs. Auchterlonie. 289 \" impertinent jay ! come to spy our miserable relations and to laugh at them.\" \" No, no, Davie, she is not an unkind woman ; and her own son married an actress, and she receives her at her house,\" commented Katie significantly. \" She may do what she likes. An actress is one thing, and a woman who scrubs floors another. Have you made up your mind finally, Katie ? \" Before Katie could answer, the door opened and the second Mrs. Auchterlonie entered, with the peculiarly distracted gait of an untrained woman who has known no dancing-master and never moved in drawing-rooms except to serve in them. She was, as has been stated, not a handsome woman, and she had probably looked better as Beenie the housemaid than as Mrs. Auchterlonie of Whiteford. She was a square woman, on whose broad shoulders a strong silk gown was only strong, and neither rich nor splendid. Her arms were short and thick, and her hands, with the marriage-ring conspicuous on one fat finger, were dreadfully in her way. Her blonde head dress had been charitably subdued by Katie since it came from the milliner's. It is not easy to say how the young men had intended to conduct a personal interview with Mrs. Auchterlonie, or whether they had contemplated one at all. They had seen her before as often as there were hairs on their heads \u2014 had been accustomed to her going in and out of that room waiting upon them. Now, in instinctive manliness, they both rose and made surly bows, to which Mrs. Auchterlonie responded with a deep duck of a curtsey, u"], [302, "Days of Yore. 290 which would have been laughable if it had not be*, so lowly. Her old feelings as Beenie Tosh the housemaid came back on Mrs. Auchterlonie, and she stood before them with apprehensive deference. \" Master Davie and Master Sandy, what will you please to have for a refresh meet, and where would you like the tray set ? \" The young men looked at each other in a confused baffled way. At the moment Davie stood up he reeled with a sensation of sudden illness, which he had concealed by grasping the back of a chair. \"The horse had better be baited, Sandy,\" he answered, indirectly addressing his brother. \" He cannot carry us back to Corehead without a feed.\" Sandy, highly resenting the small concession, remained doggedly dumb. Mrs. Auchterlonie, perspiring at every pore, finding she was to have no further reply, took this indifferent reception of her overture as a consent to a meal of some sort whose details were left to her discretion. She con sidered for a moment, standing awkwardly in the centre of her drawing-room, though Katie rose and placed a chair for her. She retreated hastily, turning at the door : \" I'll send the cook to the dining-room. I'll let you know when it is done, and I'll come and help it if you want me ; but I'll leave you the now to your cracks.\" Down Mrs. Auchterlonie went to the lower regions, to beg the cook (who was not over-obedient or over courteous to her) to have a tray of all that was \u25a0 best prepared at once for the young gentlemen. Then, shrinking from the inquisitive eyes \u2014 which scorned her with the ignorant scorn with which the lower orders over-"], [303, "The Second Mrs. Auchterlo7iie. 291 whelm an equal who has risen to be a superior \u2014 Mrs. Auchterlonie retreated, by force of habit or by a feeling of pride, not to her handsome bedroom, but to the remote bare garret where her spare \" kist \" used to stand. And sitting down on the rickety chair, she rocked herself to and fro, and then put her scored thumb in her mouth, like a child. \" What for do the lads gloom at me in that way, and me an honest woman ? Oh ! I cannot bear it, for all Miss Katie is condescending and tries to endure me. I did not ken what I would have to thole. I wish I could gang back and be a douce servant lass again. I think I would do it, were it not for the master. He would follow me and fetch me back, and that would be the worst disgrace ava.\" And Mrs. Auchterlonie sobbed heavily. III. \u2014 THE FEVER AND ITS EFFECTS. Katie was doing her best to calm and soothe her exasperated brothers, and to convince them of what she believed was her duty, though they would not see it. Sandy threatened to resign his berth mortally offend his father, and ruin himself if she caused him to fail in his errand. Davie, too, was on the verge of gravely quar reling with her. Both of them assured her solemnly that they would never come near Whiteford again, and that she would see little more of their faces if she chose to remain under her father's and stepmother's roof. She was torn by conflicting emotions, and had no guide but the single-hearted resolution not to do evil that good u 2"], [304, "Days of Yore. 292 might come \u2014 not to disobey her father to please her brothers. She, in despair, left the young men for a moment, to compose herself, and gather fresh strength, and to think over this miserable home-coming of her brothers. When she returned, neither of them was in the drawing-room ; and, in a little trepidation lest they should have gone off in their huff without the ceremony of leave-taking, she ran down to the dining-room, and was relieved by finding Davie sitting below his father's picture, to which his strong-marked dogmatic face bore so great a resemblance, with the luncheon-tray before him \u2014 not eating, however, but leaning his elbow on the table, and his head on his hand. \" Why aren't you eating, Davie ? \" asked Katie, softly ; \" and where is Sam y ? \" \" I cannot stay any longer here, Katie,\" he exclaimed, pettishly. \" I don't know what has come over me ; I'm as sick as a dog, and there is a pulse like a hammer beating in my head. Sandy, too, could not stay in the room with the food. We must be off.\" But, to Katie's increasing alarm, Davie, in place of going off, clutched at the table while he spoke. His face got first white and then scarlet, his eyes looked both hollow and glistening, and drops began to burst out on his forehead. \" Davie, dear, you are ill. What will you try? Brandy? You must not attempt to start again \u2014 I mean not for an hour or two. Come to your room and lie down, and sleep it off. I will not allow any one else to come near"], [305, "The Second Mrs. Auchterlonie. 293 you ; I will sit beside you till you are better. Oh ! do be persuaded, Davie.\" Katie had never seen Davie droop an eye or bend a leg or arm in her life before ; but her proposal was the suggestion of common sense and sisterly regard. Davie made another effort to be himself again, but felt dizzier than ever, and was forced, sorely against his will, to comply with Katie's entreaty. He was even under the necessity of holding by her slight arm, as he staggered to his room, and threw himself on the bed which he had occupied when a stout unruly boy. It was really a distressing spectacle to see a powerful young man suddenly smitten and brought down by sickness, and Katie was as much frightened at it as a creature of a cheerful temperament could be. But there were most comical elements in Davie's sickness. lie was so exasperated and cankered ; he made such dot r attempts to resist it and get the better of it. Katie even smiled as she endeavoured, with all her might, to pull off his boots, but was nearly knocked down by his starting up, and kicking off the troublesome auxiliaries. After she had shaken his pillow, and brought him a smelling bottle, she was bidden keep her smelling-bottle to herself and go about her business, and leave him to sickness and solitary majesty. Suiting the action to the word, Davie turned his back haughtily, and buried his face, in disgust and nausea and throbbing anguish, in the pillow. All sense of the ludicrous disappeared which she left the room, and went, burdened by care and regret, to seek. Sandy, to see if he could guess what was the matter"], [306, "Days of Yore. 294 with Davie, and advise her what to do. Her fears rose to something like terror when she found Sandy sitting, without his hat, on the seat beneath the weeping ash, bent down, half-blind and stupid with equal illness and helplessness. She coaxed and assisted him with still greater difficulty to his room, told Mrs. Auchterlonie of her brothers' strange simultaneous sickness, and sent for the doctor. Dr. Sutherland arrived, and soon got at the mystery by a few plain questions, which cut to the root of the matter. Had there been any fever in Sandy's ship, or in any other locality where the young men had been ? Of course there had. Had the brothers been exposed to it ? Of course they had. They had, with iron constitutions and bulldog tendencies, considered that precautions were not in their sphere. They had done their best to deve lope and mature the seeds of disease, by affording no rest to the soles of their feet, or nourishment to their thirsty throats and craving stomachs ; by coming on like madmen, by land and sea, boat and rail, without sleeping, or eating, or shifting their clothes ; without giving their ill-used constitutions the shadow of a chance to throw off infection ; and now they had broken down. Without a doubt, that was the explanation. Thus Davie and Sandy were each in for what the doctor called (taking a pinch of snuff) a smart touch of Mediterranean fever; and they need no more think of moving from where their headstrong wills had brought them, for many weeks to come, than of flying in the air, or turning poets or courtiers."], [307, "The Second Mrs. Auchterlonie. 295 The doctor at once prescribed for the patients, and curled up his shrewd lip at the bare idea of their defiance. There were great demands on Katie's decision and endurance at this time ; demands to make her a stronger and a more sedate woman ever afterwards. She had gathered from the doctor that there was no immediate danger for her brothers, and therefore she did not summon home her father by telegraph, in order to shift the responsibility from her shoulders to his. Indeed, Katie was in some apprehension that her father's coming would only complicate the trouble, and, if Davie and Sandy continued in their present state of mind, lead to more dire hostility, unless her father was so touched by their illness as to bear everything off their hand. But in the meantime there were Davie and Sandy to nurse in a bad fever, and only one yDung girl to do it. It was an alarming prospect, even in the most sanguine view of the case. Dr. Sutherland had thought it right to warn her, even while her lips parted with dismay \u2014 \" If there is any raving in either of the patients, Miss Auchterlonie, which is not unlikely, and they threaten to master you, get in the steward or a man-servant from the offices ; but of course, don't use restraint till it is neces sary, and don't be unduly alarmed. You know nurses are not to be had in a country place, but I may get you one from Edinbugrh when you cannot do without her. Yes, I trust your brothers will go on favourably ; they have everything but their own unjustifiable rashness in their favour.\" That might be all very true, and the doctor might have"], [308, "296 Days of Yore. known them all from their childhood, and \u2014 no mean judge as he was \u2014 might place confidence in Katie's dis cretion ; but how was Katie to justify that confidence ? The extremity of the case supplied some strength, and the fever was not so bad as the doctor apprehended. Davie and Sandy retained their reason, but they were as refractory as reasonable young tyrants dared to be. They were broken by the pangs of severe illness, but their original characters were not crushed out of them. They tossed and tumbled, and not only coveted, but demanded, the most improper solaces that crossed their wayward fancies. They refused to swallow medicine after the first trial, and pulled away leech and blister before they had produced the least result. It is a marvel how childish even wise men can be in pain and weakness. Davie and Sandy were not particularly wise, only vigorous-willed fellows, whose determination was a snare to them at this very moment, by its never suffering their minds to be brought down to a level with their present fortunes. Katie had it lodged in that little red head of hers what true manliness consisted of. She was sometimes pro voked to contradict the rebels, and tell them a good bit of her mind. She reminded them how much more resignedly she, a girl, had behaved under her bad in fluenza, and went the length of assuring them that the merest button of a child would conduct itself with more propriety then they did. But most frequently Katie bore with her brothers, and fought with them as a mother fights with her foolish bairns."], [309, "Tlie Second Mrs. Auchterlonie. 297 One afternoon Katie came out of Sandy's room, crying bitterly. \" Oh ! Mrs. Auchterlonie, Sandy did not swal low a drop of the draught, and the doctor said it was of great importance ; and he wants to sit up without his dressing-gown, though he speaks rationally otherwise. I must telegraph for papa.\" \" Telegraph or not, Miss Katie, as you think fit, but the time has come for me to try my hand on Master Sandy; na, he mauna risk his precious life.\" And to Katie's amazement, Mrs. Auchterlonie, with quiet but unflinching resolution, turned the handle of the door and walked in upon Sandy, with Katie trembling behind her. Sandy groaned at the unwelcome apparition. \"Master Sandy, you must do what the doctor tells you, and I must see to it ; so dinna risp your teeth at me, like a gude lad,\" said the despised woman, towering in her size and stoutness over Sandy, lying panting and quivering in his bed, as if she could take him up like a puppy in her work-hardened, capable hands. \" But eh ! Miss Katie, you havna made the lad comfortable; no wonder he is camsteary. Siccan a bed ! I dinna mean to reflect ; you are a lady, and you are worn out, poor lamb, but it must be mended. Rax back, Master Sandy; heize your head on my arm. Are you no able ? Then let a-be, and I'll manage mysel'.\" And before the queru lous revolting Sandy could repulse her, his head was easily and firmly elevated, his pillow was buffeted by the other arm into a state of submission, his very mattress was shaken up into evenness, and the draught was put to his lips, with no choice save to drink, if he would not"], [310, "Days of Yore. 298 enter into a contest, for which he felt in every nerve unfit. He was laid down again, with a sense of great relief and repose. A weary grunt was all Sandy's thanks for the benefit conferred. But an important precedent was esta blished, and the foundation of a reign laid. The fact was, Beenie (at whose exaltation the world, including herself, had wondered) had one special endow ment \u2014 she had the qualities of a super-excellent nurse. However phlegmatic and stupid in other fields, she was quick and acute here ; and the plodding application of her working days came out in unwearied devotion to the young men. Perhaps Mr. Auchterlonie had recognised this gift in his handmaid ; perhaps he had looked forward to the time when loveable Katie \u2014 not without her lovers \u2014 wrould marry, and he would be alone, sinking into old age and infirmity. Whether Mr. Auchterlonie was fore seeing or no, Mrs. Auchterlonie was the best of nurses. \" Admirable ! \" even dropped from Dr. Sutherland's close lips. And, now that she had undertaken her charge and entered on its offices, Sandy and Davie reluctantly, dumbly as it were, admitted her power. Katie was all very well \u2014 a good girl, and would learn ; but if they wanted a second's ease, a half hour's oblivion, Mrs. Auch terlonie must tend them, soothe them, sit guard over them. Tacitly the concession was granted, and sensible, large-hearted Katie showed no jealousy, but suffered herself to sink into a subordinate position, and be eclipsed in the sick-rooms. Mr. Auchterlonie returned home, made no remark, and never so much as mentioned their step-mother to the"], [311, "The Second Mrs. Auchterlonie. 299 lads. He looked in twice a day or so, put his hand to their pulses, commented on the drugs, and occasionally proposed to sit an hour or two with them. He was inwardly frightened \u2014 poor, learned, awkward gentleman ! \u2014 that his offer might be accepted ; and this although he was a true father, and would have sacrificed himself for his offspring. A pretty plight Davie and Sandy would have been in left to his care ! But Mrs. Auchterlonie never flinched. The disease assumed a malignant type in the one brother, and the doctor considered himself bound to cause her to keep the almost heart-broken Katie and every other unneces sary attendant out of the darkened dreary room. She was never absent one moment at the crisis. She breathed the tainted air, chafed the infected limbs, met the wistful eye and ear with homely mother smiles and words of cheer, speaking the more directly to the tried forlorn hearts that they were now so childlike. No sooner had Davie breasted the danger than Sandy sank to the lowest ebb to which human strength can fall and yet rally. For days he lay as one dead, with fallen jaw and sunken lack-lustre eyes, and clammy unearthly cold skin ; and still the blunt countrywoman stood at her desperate post, moistening the lips, sponging the skin, cherishing every spark of that incommunicable, irre coverable life burning low in the socket. It was not till Sandy had revived to sight and hearing and dim articulation, and was far back from the shores of death, that Katie was puzzled by finding Mrs. Auchter lonie resting on a lobby-chair and crying unrestrainedly,"], [312, "Days of Yore. 300 as Katie herself had done on a former occasion, but from a different cause. \" Oh ! my dear, never mind me. It is just that your brother Sandy has been so weak I could not spare time and thocht to greet till he was set up again, but now I'll greet my fill while he's sleeping, and be licht and bricht and ready to take care of him again when he waukens. Oh ! the fine young lad, wha fished, and rode, and hunted, and walked at the plough when the fit was on him, and sailed the high seas \u2014 to be no better than an infant. And think of his uniform, that I hung in the press out of sicht, and his sword and pistol ! Oh ! waly for the strong, proud, fiery young chap; but he'll never ken, you'll never, never tell him, Katie, that I fed him and lifted him and held him in my arms as if he had been a wee feckless wean.\" IV. \u2014 BEENIE SEEN RIGHTLY AT LAST. Slowly and surely the lads recovered. Davie was able to move into Sandy's room, and Sandy was no longer in need of constant care. It was a fine September day, and Mrs. Auchterlonie took occasion to impress the fact upon Katie, and recommended her to take \" a run \" over the fields. A walk for a young person was always \"a run,\" if it were not \"a halop\" or \"a ralyie,\" with primitive Mrs. Auch terlonie. Katie was not aware that Sandy heard them till he spoke up, imperiously, in his weakened voice\u2014"], [313, "The Second Mrs. Auchterlonie. 301 \" No, Katie, you stay here. Send my mother to take the air among the stooks.\" Katie started \u2014 Davie stared ; Mrs. Auchterlonie raised her big body quickly, and sidled into the shadow of the curtain to feel for her pocket-handkerchief. It was the first time any one of them had styled her by her title of adoption. Davie never employed it, respectful and kind to her as he was in his gruff way, after he rose from his sick-bed. Katie only applied it now and then, to express special feelings ; but the blustering, outrageous sailor never named her by any other term, to her face or behind her back, in private or in public, from that moment. Sandy had several relapses. When suffering from one of these, and feeling that his time in this world was to be short, he directed Katie where to find the key of his trunk, which had been forwarded to Whiteford, and in what quarter lay the gifts he had brought home for her, his aunts and cousins and general female friends ; for Sandy, like many another despot, was munificent. Katie brought them all to him at his request, and spread on the chairs and sofa the treasures of yellow silk, scarlet shawls, fine woven stuffs, representing imperial gardens of plants, and Noah's arks of animals, until Mrs. Auchterlonie screamed in pure delight at the grandeur of the show. Sandy stretched out a bony hand, over which the wrist band of his shirt dangled \u2014 \"a world too wide for the shrunk shank \" \u2014 and put it on the fleshy, comfortable, corresponding member of Mrs. Auchterlonie \u2014 \" Mother,\" he said, laconically, \" choose.\" It was difficult to say what Mrs. Auchterlonie could do"], [314, "Days of Yore. 302 with that extravagant bravery \u2014 the vision of herself in a yellow silk or a scarlet crape was something formidable. But only a callous heart could be unmoved by pride and gratitude, and the innocent design of gratifying Sandy. Therefore she made her broad, solid shoulders a block for sprawling tiger and luxuriantly tufted palm-tree, stepping to the right and left the better to display the drapery and its device. In truth, she would have ap peared in the glaring costume before gentle and simple, comforted under her intuitive misgivings that it was Sandy's tast-- Tt was Sandy's present, it would please Sandy ; and what did it matter what she put on ? \u2014 what did it signify for her? Katie, to be sure, should have the snowy muslin and the ivory-white, maiden-like, bridal like silk. These things were far too fine for the like ot her \u2014 a plain body, although now risen to be Mrs. Auchterlonie. Sandy was so near entire convalescence, that there was talk of his rejoining his ship when Davie returned to his office. \" But first I am going to church on Sunday,\" Sandy announced abruptly. \" If you are able, that is right, that is very pretty of you, Sandy, my man,\" murmured Mrs. Auchterlonie, in fervent admiration; though she would have reckoned it quite scandalous in herself to abstain from a similar acknow ledgment on a similar occasion. There is some good left in this old world, which has seen so much evil and been so much abused in its day. When Sandy Auchterlonie reached the Kirk doors at"], [315, "The Second Mrs. Auchterlonie. 303 Whiteford, and under the Kirk -yard trees, the dumpy arm of shy, happy Mrs. Auchterlonie within his gallantly, Davie walking before to hold open the pew-door, Katie and her father following after, many a proud heart melted, many a sharp eye glistened. Many fine churchings one may miss, and suffer no loss ; but that churching, with its contrast of ruddy, homely, middle-aged health and virtue, and white bleached manhood \u2014 that commentary on many a text of simple, practical domestic love and charity, was a sight a Christian minister might well congratulate himself upon, a Christian congregation seek to witness."], [316, "OLIVER SHAND'S PARTNER. \" TT is a pity, Oliver, you did not wait till next month, for I have a thought of going into partnership then,\" said old Oliver Shand, to his nephew, young Oliver, on the occasion of the latter's visit to the sea-port of Helms field. Old Oliver was a ship-broker, long established, wealthy, and a bachelor, with few relations. Young Oliver was a barrister, and in very good practice. The men resembled each other curiously, but did not agree the better in consequence. This might have arisen from their both being natives of the cold sea-port At all events they were both long, lean, dry men, with some thing enduring in thei' bare muscles. They were bare faced too, and altogether as stiff, sarcastic men as ever were seen. \" You are going to take a partner, Uncle Oliver : \u2014 well, I think you are right, you will be the better of one,\" commented young Oliver ; coolly adding within himself, \" The close old dog, could he not have consulted me ? cannot he come to particulars now ? as if I cared, as if I would interfere with his comfort or pleasure.\""], [317, "Oliver Shand's Partner. 305 \" Yes, I am certainly thinking of a partner,\" repeated old Oliver softly (that is, softly for him). But hugging himself privately, he thought, \" He won't ask who \u2014 he is in a huff; there would be a pretty blaze if he were apprised of the terms of the articles. Not that I care to hide them if he choose to put a question, but I'm not going to thrust them down his throat and be twitted with folly. He won't walk over me. I have managed my own affairs and I will manage them to the end, and make what alterations in them I see fit, strictly for my pleasure and convenience. My pleasure and conve nience, without saying, 'By your leave, Master Oliver,' though the fellow shall have his share when I am done with the goods, partner or no partner.\" The two men were always at this by-play \u2014 honest, disagreeable, grumpy men as they were, both of them. \" Uncle Oliver thinks I'm looking after his money. I'll make my attentions scarce. As to interfering with his concerns, by pumping him or spying upon him, I would scorn to do it,\" meditated the one. Considered the other, \" Ay, Master Oliver expects his own out of my property. So sure is he of it that he does not care to court me. He has no more interest in me or in the ships, than if I were an old stranger beggar.\" If there had not been something good in the men apart from this jealousy and self-consciousness, some real regard for each other, which they acknowledged to them selves, beneath their formality and their gruffness, they would have flown off at a tangent and never come near each other again. As it was they had never quarrelled. x"], [318, "306 Days of Yore. They kept up a grim correspondence, and young Oliver visited old Oliver during the long vacation, and saw that his kinsman was in the body. He was short and restrained to old Oliver, as old Oliver was short and restrained to him; and generally spent an uncomfortable, unsatisfactory week or fortnight with him before returning to his files of papers and leading speeches. They were a pair of kinsmen who were not selfish, and not hypocritical, but refractory and defiant to each other in their kindred blood and kindred kindness. Young Oliver was a married man, but he had never yet brought his young wife or baby children to see their elderly relation, lest people should say he used them as instruments to flatter and fawn on his wealthy bachelor uncle. He was strong in himself and his power to provide for his own household. Old Oliver would not beg for the introduction ; he was not curious about his heirs, neither did he mean to imply that his nephew Oliver's family were his heirs, though no doubt Oliver should have his portion of the old fortune. Thus the uncle and nephew stalked home past the old cross, and into one of the grey massive undecorated houses, and sat in the handsome, precise dull room which young Oliver had never deigned to brighten with another presence. They ate their excellent matter-of fact dinner, drank their good routine wine, exchanging occasional curt and crusty sentences, for they were made of too unyielding material to come into contact without rubs and scratches and fractures."], [319, "Oliver Shaud's Partner. 307 However old Oliver reverted again to his proposed partnership. \" It is a pity, Oliver, you had not waited till next month and witnessed my deed of partnership,\" he went on harping on the old string. \" Does the fellow fancy I grudge him a partner,\" reflected young Oliver restively, \" I am sure he is wel come to him, though the stranger should eat up all the profits. I am glad to say I can fight my own battles; I am not a novel hero, or briefless barrister.\" Under this persuasion, young Oliver suddenly made a proposal, with ten times the affability he would other wise have displayed. \" If you are disappointed, uncle, that I have not timed my visit better by inspiration, or spiritual affinity, for you know you never dropped me a hint on the subject, I can come back again a month hence. I am going to my wife's brother-in-law, who has taken a house in Rosemount this season ; I can return by Helmsfield and send my family home before me in the steamer.\" \" Let 'em wait with you, Oliver,\" said the old gentleman succinctly, at the same time fingering at his necktie, \" I have sufficient accommodation, and I should like them to be present also on the occasion.\" \" A fitting occasion for Anne and the children's pre sence, and fitting persons Anne and the youngsters to mix in a mercantile transaction. The old man must be slipping into his dotage, or going crazed about his part nership ; \" and Oliver stared a little. But as it struck him, if he did return to Helmsfield it would be more becoming and agreeable, and more in accordance with x 2"], [320, "308 Days of Yore. his wife's feelings, to permit her to visit his uncle, he stretched a point and submitted, saying carelessly, \" Very well, sir, if they will not put you about, my family may stay for a few days.\" \" What he deserves,\" calculated the old man, as alert as ever he was in his life, and chuckling to himself; \"good enough for them, I warrant, any day. But he won't ask me, proud puppy ! set up because he has grown a London man and lays down the law ! He will get a surprise, a cold bath, I dare say : no business of his, either, after the supercilious way he has treated me ; but he will have his portion. Oliver shall have his portion, and a tolerably handsome portion when all is done, as well as his cousins \u2014 those sneaking Burtons, who are not fit to clean his shoes \u2014 I am glad they are a good bit off in blood and in right.\" The uncle and nephew, according to their wont, said no more on the agreement between them, and parted on the simple understanding that young Oliver was to resign a great deal of grouse shooting, and a little deer stalking, and bring the live moveable part of his household to Helmsfield, to show his superior dignity and unconcern when his Uncle Oliver entered into terms of partnership with an individual or individuals unknown. Young Oliver the barrister, his wife, twin babies, and couple of servants, set out for Helmsfield. The barrister's wife was a warm-hearted, good-tempered, contented, lively woman. She was girl-like yet in her cloak and hat, with her flaxen hair in profuse plaits. Her eyes were blue \u2014 not the sleepy blue, but the steel or rather the"], [321, "Oliver Shaud's Partner. 309 sapphire blue, and were the quickest, as well as the kindest, imaginable. She had merry, mobile dimples, and altogether she was a very fair young matron, a very bright young matron, a dear loving joyous woman, shrewd but guileless, who made everybody with whom she came into contact better and happier. Her husband might snap and snarl at her at his will ; she never minded him; she was fully persuaded that he was an excellent man in the main, only unlucky in his manner, and that was his misfortune, poor fellow, and no affair of other people's. So industrious was he, so constant, so considerate to her, so careful of the babies, she was well convinced that he loved her and his children with all his heart, and that he would have laid down his life for them if need were. As it was, he toiled and slaved to keep them in comfort ; in short he was the best of men. If this faith did not go far to sweeten the morose man who inspired it, and make him the best of men, it is hard to say what would have done it. There was no difficulty about introducing Anne to Uncle Oliver. It would have been better for all parties if she had been introduced to him from the first, and spent a portion of every summer at the seaport since she took young Oliver in hand and shone upon him like a per petual sun-beam. Uncle Oliver was at the coach station, before the spacious hotel, on the evening of their arrival. Young Oliver distinguished the old make of hat, the check neck tie, and the swallow-tailed coat, which were quite the thing when Uncle Oliver was in his prime. He pointed"], [322, "Days of Yore. 310 out to his wife a figure well advanced in the vale of years, a tall man slightly stooping with the burden of time, a face by no means inexpressive or of a common type, and a long head thatched with dry worsted brown hair, which declined to turn grey, and might as well have been a wig for any sympathy between it and its owner. Oliver junior was rather astonished to find the old gentleman waiting for them. Courtesy and attention were things out of his way, though he was a somewhat liberal man, in spite of a somewhat churlish exterior \u2014 a man to be respected if not liked. It must have been this partnership that was so working with him. It began to look a serious matter when it was so altering the old man's habits. And yet young Oliver had not made any inquiry about it, important as k might be to his prospect- Dour as a door nail, and with a certain rude nobility, he would not take steps to obtain from other sources the information his uncle had not vouchsafed, and which he would not solicit from him. Having come to the coach office, Uncle Oliver did not behave in any astounding fashion. He did not embrace Anne (young OHver's wife) or hug Nolly and Norry. He shook hands with the first, took no notice of the last, but asked young Oliver what he wanted done with the luggage. Here was a cab, they might have two, half-a-dozen if they chose, or here were a couple of porters from the yard if the men's services would be preferred. Uncle Oliver never suffered himself to be driven, so that Anne saw no more of him until she reached one"], [323, "Oliver S hand's Partner. 311 of those solid houses, so stately in their plair.ness, about Union Crescent. Oliver, her Oliver, had never told her that Uncle Oliver had been improving it, but the hall was fresh painted. She smelt it yet, and she was sure the drawing-room, with its fresh carpet of sheaves of the lily of the valley and its low rosewood chairs and tiny oval foot-stools, had been furnished quite recently ; but of course her Oliver never noticed these things. Old Oliver came in with Anne's husband, and hoped she would make herself comfortable. He bade her ring for whatever she wanted, and he himself ordered tea for the travellers, since, in consideration of his clock-work four o'clock dinner, they had dined on the road. He was clearly anxious to be hospitable, but to entertain strangers was a hard duty to him. Anne thought disinterestedly how much more agreeable it would have been, and how much better for the old gentleman, if he had married a well-disposed wife, to take half his burdens off his shoulders, thirty years before. Thirty years before and Uncle Oliver would have been the age of his nephew Oliver, that is, five-and-thirty \u2014 the years of discretion for a man in matrimony, as in everything else. Anne did her best to relieve Uncle Oliver by pouring out the tea. She was hungry and thirsty, and cheery and chatty, and interested in her husband's native town, and delighted with Uncle Oliver's handsome com fortable house. Uncle Oliver listened to the last praise with a flicker of his well-opened eyelids, and this, as she very well knew, invariably betokened lurking gratification in young Oliver."], [324, "Days of Yore. 312 Then he rose and excused himself, and said in a short, abstracted manner, that he must leave her. He should like to take his nephew Oliver, if he had no objection, to introduce him to \u2014 hem \u2014 his future partner. \" Oh 1 never mind me, Uncle Oliver,\" Anne said, heartily, \" don't let me be in your way ; you two gentle men go about your business, I have plenty to do, \u2014 I have my clothes to unpack, and I have to order Nolly and Norry to be put to bed ; I hope we will see more of each other to-morrow evening, or at least during the next week.\" But Uncle Oliver muttered he was engaged to-morrow evening, and he had to go from home for part of the week, but no doubt they would get better acquainted ; and she must ring the bell if she wanted anything. \" Just you, Oliver, over again,\" Anne remarked archly, from the tea-tray to her husband, while Uncle Oliver was putting on his great coat in the lobby. \" A great deal more in him than he lets out, and all the more precious, Noll, on that account. It is a little odd of him to go from home when we are here, but perhaps it is business, and you never mind any visitor when business comes in the way ; or perhaps it is that we may make ourselves fully at home and get accustomed to the house without him, and see all your old acquaintances without any restraint. Any way I am sure I shall like Helmsfield very much. I say, Noll, you may well hope that I should like Uncle Oliver, for otherwise I would never have liked you, sir.\" Uncle Oliver walked deliberately with his nephew in the"], [325, "Oliver Shand's Partner. 313 September dusk towards Anchor Street and into a little square. The old man was growing heated and excited. \"Oliver,\" he said, \"you don't think fit to ask me anything about my partner, \u2014 yet it is fit that I should have company and support, if it were only that I am breaking up, or shall be breaking up soon.\" Stout Oliver, the barrister, was the least thing in the world touched by this appeal. It was the first time he had heard his uncle confess a weakness or look forward to a solace. Judging from himself, poor old Uncle Oliver must have felt his needs keenly before he came to this pass. But he only answered : \" I declare I have not the least objection, uncle ; it would be entirely out of my sphere to object, and I am even pleased if you have found a person to meet your requirements. I have thought it well that I should know him in good time. It is no business of mine, you know, uncle, who he is, \u2014 that is your look out You have always conducted your business without my counsel, and quite right too. Indeed, my opinion would be next to worthless, as I am a barrister, and you are a ship-broker, and I take it our ideas would not square. I have been away from Helmsfield for the last dozen years, too, and I begin now not to know even the ship-owners and merchants by name. I suppose this partner of yours is some fellow in your own line, able to take the active part of your concern. He may be some lad you have taken an interest in, and reared, and pro moted, and who is already familiar with your corner of the docks as manager or clerk. I only hope he may suit, for your sake, but I repeat it is no business of mine \""], [326, "Days of Yore. 314 t \" It is no business of yours,\" echoed Uncle Oliver, driven to a sardonic grin by his nephew's haughty re assurance of liberty ; \" but it is not a man, but a woman, that is in question.\" Young Oliver stopped, as if he had been shot, and the truth flashed upon him. \" You don't mean to say you are going to be married?\" he cried out. \" I do mean to say it,\" acknowledged old Oliver, with a good deal of shame, but the utmost obstinacy. \" It has been kept quiet, but you might have heard it if you had put yourself to the trouble to ask a question. I am sixty five, and she is fifty ; but though she were only seventeen there is no law that could interfere when we two are agreed. I have known her all her life ; but if I had only known her since yesterday, what is that to anybody but myself? She has tried the experiment before, and ma naged her husband's house and reared her children without a voice doing anything but lip-lard her ; but though she were an ignorant fool of an old maid who had been kept out of the world in a drawing-room for half-a-century, as a girl is stowed away in a school-room until the ware is wanted, it is my venture, and nobody need interfere.\" Oliver was very much put out by the old man's trick, but he had time to recover himself during his uncle's unusually long speech. It would not do for him to make a rout about his wealthy uncle's marriage, even although it was to a widow, and a widow with children. That proceeding would be foreign to all his notions and actions. \" Oh ! of course, uncle, I won't interfere, \u2014 no fear of"], [327, "Oliver Shaud's Partner. 315 that;\" in a moment he forced himself to the customary congratulations, delivered very ungraciously. \"I wish you joy, if there is any joy going, only it is a pity you had not been a little more explicit beforehand, that my wife and I might have been ready with our good wishes, and come provided with the ordinary stock of finery.\" \"No finery wanted,\" the old man growled ; \"the thing is to be done quietly to-morrow afternoon. And his whole manner expressed very plainly that young Oliver need not attend if he did not wish it; it was not yet too late to take his wife home ; and he need not go now to see Mrs. Rose even, if he were not inclined. Oliver did not complain that he had been entrapped upon the back of his own loud profession of indifference, and forced either to countenance the old man's folly or to make a public exposure and laughing-stock of his unwarrantable disapproval. \" You forget,\" he said again, ironically, \"it is no business of mine. It seems you have given me and my wife an invitation, such as it was, to your marriage, and to stand on ceremony at this hour would argue a right to object, to which we don't pretend.\" So young Oliver entered the bride elect's house with his uncle, feeling as if he were walking on stinging nettles. He was so disturbed in his mind that he scarcely saw where he was going. It was one of the smaller of those grey houses so much alike in Helmsfield. They were shown into a room where a comely middle-aged woman, a good deal more confused than Uncle Oliver, and some"], [328, "316 Days of Yore. half-grown young people, two lads and a girl, were wait ing to receive them. Young Oliver neither saw nor cared to see anything more than that there was no evidence of wretchedness about the place. The family appeared respectable, and the woman \u2014 the widow \u2014 was like her kind. After she had got them seated, she began to recover herself and prattle in a placid simple style. No great show of design here. It must have been Uncle Oliver, the old dog, who walked wilfully into this net. If Anne had been there she would have noticed a thousand things more than that obtuse, irate man did. She would have seen that the house was very plain, but was not shabby, as must have been the case, had it not been the house of a good manager and a motherly heart ; that Mrs. Rose was not stylish, or refined, or clever, but that she was certainly kind, a lover of flowers and birds, living and dead, and of her boy Jack's natural history specimens, and her boy Cathcart's drawings and models, and her girl Chatty's embroidery. And looking at the elderly couple talking together in so matter-of-fact a tone, and looking at each other covertly and awkwardly in their regard, Anne would have surmised that in this house, hard and dry Uncle Oliver was seen under a different light from that which shone upon him in his own or any other dwelling. Young Oliver recognised nothing of all this, as he sat brooding over his uncle's ridiculous behaviour, and the extreme provocation of becoming a party to it. Not that Oliver the barrister's manner was specially often-"], [329, "Oliver Shand's Partner. 317 srve. He was a man and a gentleman, though not a pliant one, and he looked upon his entrance into that house as a pledge to be on tolerable behaviour in it. He was not more rigid and self-concentrated then than he was in general. It was a welcome relief to young Oliver's feelings, however, to get away, to return to his own room, unbosom himself to his sympathetic wife, and give vent to his in dignation against the offenders. Even Anne, with her inveterate inclination to look at the brightest side of everything \u2014 an inclination so irre pressible that it would often have looked like affectation in a less open, sincere, charitable woman\u2014 stood aghast and was largely aggrieved. Uncle Oliver's marrying was like cheating Nolly and Norry. She had been glancing about the house and thinking how her boys would come into a handsome inheritance, and not require to quit England to go out as sheep fanners to Australia, or as engineers to India. To marry a widow with children too, when his nephew Oliver had not only a baby, but twin babies, and the best judges assured her there were not two finer little fellows of eleven months in the kingdom ! Even their papa could scarcely carry them one on each arm now, and twins were such a pretty sight ! It was a great shame of old Uncle Oliver not to be engrossed with these boys, his natural descendants, and not forget everything for them. And to think : Anne had not a gown with her fit for a wedding, and not a day to prepare one, making her look like a fright, and Oliver like a ninny. She had a great mind to excuse herself"], [330, "318 Days of Yore. from being present, though she was staying in the bride groom's house. But as young Oliver continued to rage, Anne began to look less glum, and even contradicted him with \" Not so bad as that,\" \"Oh! fie, Oliver,\" and \" After all, we must make the best of it.\" Anne, though she was as sweet as honeysuckle in her flaxen plaits, was not insipid or phlegmatic, or subservient to any one. She was a true frank woman, with a mind and principles of her own. She had always been fearless of her husband: she had contradicted him flatly the first night she saw him ; and this had possibly been one of her attractions to him. And while she admired him and obeyed him in all wifely duty, she had continued to contradict him flatly every time she thought him in the wrong to this day. She would do it to the last, and a vast deal better it was for Oliver. Now while Oliver was inveighing rather savagely about his uncle, making him out to be a malicious rascal in his stratagem, and Mrs. Rose a mercenary, truckling creature of a widow, with pauper children, Anne, being very sen sitive to an injustice and very generous to all injured persons, cut him short at once: \"I'll tell you what, Noll, you will make me believe you cared very much for Uncle Oliver's money if you come so near to slandering him and Mrs. Rose.\" She had peace, for Oliver was silent, in towering dudgeon. She had galled him, touched him to the quick. He had cared for Uncle Oliver's money. He felt that now in his bitter disappointment ; and if he had not inten-"], [331, "Oliver Shan As Partner. 319 tionally deceived others, he had deceived himself. It was a blow to his pride, for he had plumed himself on his independence, while in truth he had been looking forward confidently to his succession to Uncle Oliver's cheques and shipping. This was what most other men would have done in his circumstances ; but he had counted himself superior in this respect to other men. It might not have been altogether for himself. He was conscious of that, when a chill came over his indignation as he reflected what would become of bouncing Nolly and Norry, and their mother, if he happened to be taken away from them prematurely. For all that it was an intense humiliation to young Oliver's exaggerated manliness that he had coveted another man's gains, and calculated on the profit of his kinsmanship and favour. He had esteemed himself a self-sufficient, thoroughly-equipped man, who feared no amount of work in his profession, and could always rely, since he had surmounted the first hard start, on obtaining his wages. Yet all the time he had been resting on prospects which were at the will of another, \u2014 looking to old Oliver to be backed and propped. It may have been a singular thing for a purely worldly man to do, but it is true that young Oliver forgot the money-loss in the wound to his self-esteem. He was so goaded and lashed by the thought that he had allowed a crafty mask to blind his feelings alike from himself and his neighbours, that he went at once to the other extreme, and began to take a really tolerant view of old Oliver's dereliction. He now thought that his uncle had merely"], [332, "Days of Yore. 320 done what he had a good right to do, and if he had been somewhat secret about it in the first place, he had in the second place brought the principle members of the family to witness its consummation. Young Oliver tossed and tumbled, eating and digesting his humble pie, till, to divert his mind, he was glad to turn to remembering how the widow had looked, and specula ting what sort of woman she would be. His being a lawyer helped him here, but he could not arrive at any more distinct conception though he laboured hard at it (to withdraw his attention from sorer subjects) than that she struck him as being like his wife's mother, about whom he did not imagine he had any particular associations, since he had rather meant to be a son-in-law of iron. Still the recollection of his mother-in-law blended with his impressions of Mrs. Rose, and would not be separated from them. When Anne rose next morning, she had certainly made up her quick mind, and was bent on announcing her resolution. \" I am determined to make the best of it, Noll, and really I think we are raising a mountain out of a mole hill. I'll tell you what, I'm not going to lend myself to the fancy that we have been injured, or work myself into a fit of sulkiness and fury. No one has done us wrong. What is it ? Uncle Oliver is going to marry ; the best thing any man can do, soon or late. He will now have a suitable companion, and an interested nurse when he needs one, and we will be freed from care on his account"], [333, "Oliver Shaud's Partner. 321 No doubt the widow must be a horrid creature,\" continued Anne, making a wry face, \" though I have not had time to hear that she has compromised herself in any other way than by consenting to many him. She could not help another man marrying her, and then dying and leaving her and her family not very well off. I dare say if they had been in affluent circumstances she would not have changed her state a second time. Women are so selfish, aren't they, Noll, and fickle and false through their selfish ness? But a family of any kind will wake up Uncle Oliver's silent house. I heard the echoes of my foot steps here last night long before it was dark. As it is to be a quiet wedding, I believe my purple silk will do very well.\" Oliver said not a word, and Anne turned quickly and looked into the grim face. \" It is not that I am not sorry for you, dear, since it is such a blow to you,\" she added, administering another blow by way of recovering him, \" but you have taken such good care of us all, that I have no dread about your providing for the future. Why, Noll, you could support half-a-dozen households by the might of your brains, and your un wearied arm. I think I prefer to depend upon them : do you hear that, Noll ? And if difficulties do beset us, we will only fare the harder. Surely that need not cost us a sigh beforehand, or at the time either. Two young, healthy, able, attached persons, with Nolly and Norry \u2014 we are passing rich. I should be horribly ashamed to think otherwise, for a single moment. As for Nolly and Norry, I am persuaded now it is the very best thing that Y"], [334, "Days of Yore. 322 could have happened to them, this loss of Uncle Oliver's inheritance. I have heard times without number, there is not a greater misfortune for young men than to have a fortune made for them, and elegant shoes to step into without any exertion of their own. So, Noll, you take care, and not make your fortune too quickly, or leave a parr of shoes behind you that won't pinch, and gape, and want cobbling, and blacking here and there, for Nolly and Norry.\" Not a word from young Oliver except a gruff snort; but his wife understood him, and she would have told you that that was Oliver coming round. Down-stairs into the dining-room tripped Anne, the sensible, affectionate peacemaker. There sat Uncle Oliver on his wedding morning- \u2014 that morning that looked so great to his imagination thirty years ago. There was no change on his room, no change on his work-a-day coat, or his usual habit of reading his newspapers. Anne went straight up to him to say good morning, and to express in tone and look what her husband would not have accomplished in a hundred years. \"I wish you much joy, Uncle Oliver: but why did you not tell me what you told Oliver last night? Don't you know that men are dreadfully stupid in these things ? \u2014 and I would have liked to have been ready for my new aunt ; but I will do my best, and I am convinced we will all get on nicely together.\" Little words easily spoken, little words never to be forgotten."], [335, "Oliver Shaud's Partner. 323 Uncle Oliver stared, and half dropped his newspaper, and got out a \" I \u2014 I beg your pardon, thank you, my dear.\" It would have cost Anne little effort to kiss the gaunt poker of an old man, he was so like her husband. She had often kissed that other gaunt poker (like a sweet-pea twining round a ntgged stick), and the operation had not created resentment or been without its effect. But she refrained. She would leave that ceremony to Mrs. Rose. Anne made tea to the two rueful-looking men, and let them talk in their own pugnacious, wrangling style. At the close of the breakfast she resumed the charge. A man to be married that day at half-past three, in time for the second last train south, and not to speak about it, was preposte rous and not to be endured I \" Uncle Oliver, I under stand you want the wedding to be very quiet,\" she observed in an oft-hand way, as if she were at a wedding every day of the week. Old Oliver made a restless gesture, as if he were disposed to bolt at the last moment, and young Oliver snuffed the air. \" And it is not to be till after three,\" continued Anne easily, as if it wtre a dinner. This was a piece of delicate and requisite art on Anne's part, for of course women in their hearts, and mostly on their tongues, make a thou sand times the fuss about a wedding that men do. \" I should like, if you think it would be agreeable to her, to call for Mrs. Rose this morning, as I have to be out buying some things at any rate.\" This was cruel towards old Oliver, friendly as Anne seemed to consider it. To-morrow he was to have a"], [336, "Days of Yore. 324 Mrs. Shand, for whose dispositions he was to be held answerable thenceforth to the end of their joint lives, but that he was to take time by the forelock and speak up for Mrs. Rose's humour to-day ! \"As you like, my dear,\" he dismissed the subject impa tiently enough. But at that instant a scream sounded faintly from Nolly and Norry in the distant bed-room (transformed into a nursery), and he continued hastily : \" I hope you ring the bell, ma'am, if you want anything. I trust the children are all right.\" \" Perfectly, Uncle Oliver,\" Anne nodded ; they are two wild, reckless young fellows, who thrive and tease their nurses everywhere. Yes, I ring, thank you, and I fetch in addition.\" Anne checked herself, for an inspira tion was coming upon her, and she was about to perform a brilliant coup detat which might be likened in skill to some of the feats of a certain Imperial gentleman. \"I say, Oliver,\" she faced round upon her husband with consummate saucy candour and daring, \" you may come with me if you like, as you have nothing to do, and are like a fish out of water in consequence. If you don't care for a walk you can stay at home ; I have a good tongue in my head, and I can do very well in your native place without you, Noll.\" To Anne's astonishment and self-congratulation, Oliver was disposed to comply, crustily and sheepishly. He was tired of his own thoughts, and he was not going to have it said that he was full of jaundice and wrath at his uncle's marriage. He would go abroad and bow coolly to his acquaintances, and allude calmly to the event of the day,"], [337, "Oliver Shaud's Partner. 325 and put a stop to the laugh which he was aware was going the round of Helmsfield at his expense. Anne was so accommodating and sympathetic in her nature that she was getting interested and gleeful about Uncle Oliver's marriage. Young Oliver suffered her to lead him into a jeweller's shop. She selected a gold bracelet, chaste, sober, rich ; and she told him : \" You know, Noll dear, it is the thing for a woman of her age \u2014 a grasping harpy without question,\" looking him full in the face, \" from a poor, ill-used, imposed-upon couple of our means. If we had been great folks, old man, it must have been diamonds I suppose, and how you would have set your teeth and grudged it, you Jew ! \" Anne either was, or made believe to be, delighted with Mrs. Rose's house when they found it. They had some difficulty about this, for Oliver had not even brought away its number. Of course it was out of sorts to-day, but Anne could see with half an eye that it was an un pretending pleasant home. Mrs. Rose herself was so gratified at seeing Anne and her husband this morning, there was so much spiritual affinity (shall we say ?) between the women, that she was a different person from what she had been the night before. Still she appeared the same placid motherly woman Oliver the lawyer had taken her for, as she begged the two strangers coming out of the stinging wind to sit closer to the fire, and throw off their wraps, lest they should suffer going out to the cold again."], [338, "326 Days of Yore. Poor bride of a second and mature experience \\ When she came to think of herself, it was yet not of herself that she thought, but of the children \u2014 those half-affronted, half-comprehending children \u2014 who were nevertheless firm in their allegiance to their mother. The half-grown lads, glooming and reddening, drew near to stand at her beck, and the pale, precocious, thoughtful girl (such as comely simple mothers often have), started out of her stillness to take what was in her mother's hand, and serve her and bow before her. Mrs. Rose was eager that the children should impress their new connections favourably, and was desirous to impart the information that Jack had the prospect of going abroad as a doctor in a whale ship until he was old enough to take his degree, which would be in two sessions ; and Cathcart was to pass up to his uncle in London this very autumn to study as an artist, and even Chatty spoke of following her brother to keep his house whenever Cathcart had a house to keep. Mrs. Rose's voice broke down a little in the middle of her self assertion. She had never whispered, not even to the children, how she would not have dared to indulge these schemes in their behalf had it not been for her old friend Air. Shand, that friend to whom she bore a soft penitence since she had slighted him long ago for another, and a less sterling man. Mrs. Oliver knew none of these facts but she could penetrate them. She could see that Mrs. Rose was gentle and trembling, and the children on the defensive, poor things. She was afraid they would think her Oliver"], [339, "Oliver Shaud's Partner. 327 detestable (till they knew him better), like their step father elect. She at least could afford the luxury of being affable and kind. The children were not to come to their new home till their mother had returned from her second marriage tour, but Anne looked at them, and promptly borrowed Charlotte. \" The boys can look after themselves, I dare say,\" she said, \"so can my husband here, but I want a young lady to walk about with me, and take me to the shops, and tell me the gossip. Please come, Miss Chatty.\" Chatty, shy, sensitive, suspicious, gazed in Anne's face, trusted her on the spot, laughed, and consented. Anne admired the embroidery and the objects of natural history, but when she came to the sketches, she burst out enthusiastically, \" Your son will be a painter, Mrs. Rose. Oliver, how proud you and I would be if Nolly or Norry grew up to draw like that.\" Not only the mother's eyes brightened, but Cathcart started forward, the praise was so genial, so unsophisti cated, so evidently sincere. \" You are flattering me, Mrs. Shand,\" he said, though he did not think it flattery, looking admiringly at the fair dimpled face of the young matron ; \" but I will think you in earnest if you let me try your likeness.\" \" My wife is a vain goose,\" put in Oliver ; \" that was just what she wanted.\" \" It is not true. I was only photographed once, and it was at his request \u2014 there, traitor ! But only think, Noll, what it would be to get the boys taken now, and"], [340, "328 Days of Yore. have their likenesses after they are men, if they are spared, dear boys.\" \" What would be the use of it ? \" protested blunt, matter-of-fact Oliver. \" They will no more be like what they are now, than full-grown frogs are like sprawling tadpoles.\" What was the bracelet to this family, though it had been diamonds, in comparison with these familiar, jesting words, with their subtle compliment, from the cynic Oliver ? \" Mrs. Rose is a good, kind woman,\" Anne assured Oliver, when they were in the street again. \" Do you know what person she reminds me of? I declare \u2014 of my mother. You need not find fault, for I cannot criticise her after that. Did you really think so, too, Noll ? Well, that was wonderful. I think Uncle Oliver has done very well, exceedingly well \u2014 yes, I do. The children are a fine family, and Uncle Oliver may have reason to be proud of that Cathcart.\" Anne mentioned the resemblance she had detected to Uncle Oliver at luncheon. It was an easier matter now to touch on Mrs. Rose, for the clock was running off its minutes, and the old man was almost standing face to face with his marriage. A third time that day, and it was something ominous, Uncle Oliver addressed Anne as \" my dear.\" \" I am glad you think so, my dear,\" he said to her, with alarm ing submission. But perhaps it was because it was his marriage -day, and a great deal of licence is allowed to a man on his marriage-day. Again a third or fourth"], [341, "Oliver Shaud's Partner. 329 time he urged, \" And if you want anything, Mrs. Oliver, be sure you ring for it,\" so emphatically, that he might have been intending to subjoin, \" and rather than you should not have it, I will get it for you myself.\" It was a sober, humdrum marriage ; so humdrum that the principals, aware of its total want of interest to the public at large, huddled it over in a corner. Nobody present but the priest, the nephew Oliver, and his wife, and another widow to serve as bridesmaid to the mother and bride in her lavender-like second mourning for her first husband. Uncle Oliver forgot to provide himself with the trifle of a best man, and had to call on one of the reluctant lads to do the duty. Uncle Oliver took young Oliver aside before he set out with his douce partner on his douce journey. \" Oliver, I always meant you to succeed to a fair portion of my property.\" \" Do as you please,\" exclaimed young Oliver, more testily than ever. \" I tell you it is not my business how you dispose of your fortune. I cannot dictate to you in that respect.\" \" Hold your tongue, man,\" said his uncle, imperiously; \" who is asking you to dictate 1 What I want to say is this : I would like now to leave an equal share to your wife. Of course, I shall do something for my sister's children ;\" and Uncle Oliver, gaunt poker as he was, manifestly thrilled at the words as if they touched his nerves in the spirit of a far-away dream. \" But,\" he continued, \" I can do all that. I should like also to"], [342, "Days of Yore. 330 leave a small legacy a-piece to your boys, because their mother would like it. Am I right, Oliver?\" The articles of partnership being now signed and sealed, the partners drove away, amid no loud manifesta tions of mirth, it is true, but amid a good deal of very tender and very sympathetic joy."], [343, "JUDY. I. \u2014 THE SEA-BEACH AT FRENCH TOWN. T7RENCH TOWN, a boggy bit of land with a man- sion-house, or rather elegant cabin, on the bay of Galway, was occupied long ago by Larry French and his wife, his daughters and nieces. The cabin was a long low building of stone, with a thatch roof, showing sus picious patches of the loveliest olive and emerald green. From the dining-room window, when the water was up the river Lambert, a man could have thrown a cast with his fishing-rod, and had an excellent chance of catching his breakfast or his supper of rich red trout. But it was when the potato bloom was blue, and the kingcups were yellow, when the cotton-grass fluttered in the wind, and a lark singing hung high in the blue sky above the blue sea and the brown river, that the place had its chiefest charm. It had also its improvements ; Larry French had been in England, had seen Strawberry Hill, and heard of other places, and had come home an elegant gentleman, smitten with a rage for improve ments. Being an Irishman, he began at the wrong end."], [344, "Days of Yore. 332 Having the sea and the river, he began to dig a ditch of . canal, and with the mountains of Connemara in the purple distance, he planned a wilderness. At the rate Larry was proceeding at, his grandson might lay the foundation of a new mansion-house, if the whole race were not in the meantime swept away by gout, rheuma tism, and ague. Gout was a frequent visitor at the breezy watery cabin. Even young women \u2014 belles and ball-goers\u2014 were attacked by it. The arched foot of Diana French, and even the light foot of fairy Judy Butler, were occasionally swathed in flannel in conse quence of a smart touch. They were temperate enough as yet, poor dears, and agile as colts ; but the dreadful gout was deep in their constitutions, having been duly handed down since the reigns of Elizabeth and the Henrys. But even the gout was a small matter to Larry French. He went about happy as a king, with his hat on one side of his chesnut curls, and a foot rule, the only instrument he ever carried, in his hand. Had not Mrs. French begun where Larry ended he would not have held the shreds of his possessions to gether, nor even kept the thatch roof over his head. There was no nonsense about Mrs. French. She did not wear the hoop and hood of her station, but the tight petticoats and little hat of a farmer's wife. But she was more than a farmer's wife. She was the only farmer about French Town. She did the farming, while Larry dangled about the landscape gardening. She was up by five in the morning ; out in all weathers ; every day she did her day's work. She was a strutting figure in her stout"], [345, "fudy. 333 shoes and her Joseph, her broad shrewd face tanned to a brick-brown, and her dark hair, bleached and dried dangling under her mob-cap like the seaweed on the rocks. She followed the out-workers, hailed and hectored the boys, superintended the ploughing, weeding, mowing, shearing, and potato gathering from spring to fall. She had scarcely time for her meals not to speak of manners. After she came indoors at six o'clock in the evening, she would sleep sweetly in her chair till the supper-bell rang, while the girls and boys were jingling on the harp sichord, and dancing and romping at \" the lady in the hole,\" around her. A coarse specimen of womankind, but honest and hearty in her roughness, and, strange to say, got on swimmingly with elegant Larry French. The young people of French Town were down on the beach gathering shells in the summer weather for their winter shell work. They were assisted by some of theyoung Galway sparks, who submitted to the general ordinance of labour, in order to sun themselves in the light of the girls' eyes, to improve their wits by contact with the lively tongues, and to soften the asperities of their boorish humours by being trained under the modish damsels. That was a fantastic but simple time when all that was needed to make a room superior to mere vulgar cosiness was shell work and japan work, chair-covers and foot-stools in cross-stitch, and a shelf or two of odd bits of china. In these days men were proud of their wives' achieve ments in quilts, and brought their fellows to listen to their single tune on the harpsichord, or to look at their"], [346, "Days of Yore. 334 three painted copies of a rose, a lily, and a July flower. So the nymphs of French Town were then as earnest in picking up \" steeples,\" \" glass shells,\" and \" John o' Groats,\" as if the process included the whole duty of woman. And the sparks of Galway consented to creep on all-fours and grovel in pools at the risk of spoiling buckskins, top-boots, and points, and would allow them selves to be laden like pack-horses to lug up to French Town heavy sacks like millers' men. After all there was some loyalty, some endurance, in the shell gathering and shell work. And that was indeed a charming group on the beach at French Town, \u2014 the men in blues, yellows, and peaches ; and the women in their printed linen or green Irish stuff because of the salt water and strong sun, and such like sensible considerations. Seated on the shingle with the foam at their feet, or out on a rock singing like mermaids, or scaling the bank with its small prickly sea side roses, such girls as Diana and Grace French, Honor and Judy Butler looked well. Life had quaint as well as strong flavours. At that very moment Judy Butler, the youngest and most childish of the girls, whose black gipsy hair would cluster in her neck in place of hanging in straight profuse curls down her back, was seated in a snug corner holding a smuggled conversation with her sentimental cousin, Diana. Diana was not repeating any of Captain Dillon's compliments this time, but was transferring to Judy with wonderfully little circumlocution Captain Dillon's cre dentials from the town of Galway, and laying before the"], [347, "Judy. 335 girl conditional proposals of marriage from Captain Dillon's honoured uncle, the attorney in Lombardy Street. Marriage was at a very high figure when women were described as at their last prayers for husbands, and the intervention and advocacy even of wild young nephews were readily used. Judy knew Torney Dillon very well. He was the stout, bland, elderly gentleman with the curled wig, who sometimes came out and fished at French Town. She remembered he quoted scraps of Latin to Uncle French when Larry was showing off his intended im provements. But he only gave the Latin to Uncle French, for he said what he had to say to the young people in indulgent Irish-mellowed English, \" Let us see how you young folk can play forfeits,\" he would insist : \" No, I can't lend you my wig, but be easy, I'll spare you my walking-stick. What did you ask, Mistress Diana ? Has it the name of Jupiter carved a-top, as Captain Dillon's has Apollo ? No, no, I am not so impudent. Oh ! he did not give himself the name, it was bestowed on him, but I christened my walking-stick myself, an it please you ; and I did not trouble to take any but the original name, Jerry Dillon, of Dillon's House, Lom bardy Street, at your service. You can read it for your self, Mistress Diana.\" Torney Dillon might have been a counsellor, nay a judge, in old Dublin, had he gone in for the higher walks of the law, and cut his half-a-century country con nections and country respectability. His wife was dead a decorous year and a half before, and he wanted to replace"], [348, "336 Days of Yore. her with a second mother over his small family of seven children \u2014 his son Jack and his daughter Sally being re spectively eighteen and nineteen years, and full of wilful ness and insubordination. He turned his attention to the sisters Butler, orphan nieces of his friend Larry French \u2014 well-born girls with a trifle of money and sweet looks. He gave the preference to Judy because she was to his mind the sweetest \u2014 the flower being only in the bud. In place of Torney Dillon being considered guilty of indiscretion, Mistress Diana had a mind to think of him for herself. The Torney had an extensive business, and could make a fair settlement, notwithstanding the seven children. He was liberal, generous, and even-tempered. He looked a portly man when he wore his velvet coat and his best powdered wig, pleasantly rosy about the gills, with a genial twinkle in the eye, though a quiet man in the main. What could even a woman who signed her self Chloe, and styled Captain Dillon Apollo, and Tom O'Flaherty Strephon, ask more in matrimony? But there was honour in these transactions ; the proposal was for the Butlers, not the Frenches, and besides, the wild nephew himself had cast a glamour over Mistress Diana. Diana informed her elder cousin Honor first, as in duty bound. It kept Diana a whole morning mincing over her knitting at Honor's particular quilting table in the much lumbered hall. But Honor would none of the proposals. She was a queer girl, Honor. She laughed at Diana's and Judy's riddles, characters, rebuses, and jeered at their French classic foolery of calling each other"], [349, "Judy 337 Chloe and Delia. At the same time Honor was as un manageable and unworldly as possible in certain things. One point on which she had always spoken decidedly was that she would not marry in a hurry, that she liked to be her own mistress, that she could not respect every man, and that she would not promise to \" love, honour, and obey \" a man whom she could not respect, though he were able to give her brocades for poplins and Brus sels for Irish lace. She was not frightened to look the world in the face for herself and Judy. She respected Torney Dillon, but not in a marrying way. She could not contradict Tomey Dillon with a light conscience, she could not tease him, and she must contradict and tease her husband as well as respect him \u2014 that was settled in her own mind. So the worthy gentleman's suit went begging to Judy. Honor counselled Judy to follow her example. What had a child like Judy to do with Dillon's house in Lom bardy Street, where were a boy and girl older than her, besides the younger ones ? But Honor would not con trol Judy, and just because men would bow before Honor when they would merely have chucked Judy under the chin, Honor could not control Judy. Diana French had broken off from Captain Dillon and the remaining shell-gatherers. She had led Judy Butler with her up among the coarse bent-grass through which rustled a tiny tributary of the river Lambert, where the girls could wash their treasures without wetting them selves. There Diana introduced the subject of the vacancy in Torney Dillon's household, and its important z"], [350, "338 Days of Yore. conclusions. There Judy sat listening, as she plaited the long, stiff, blue-green, white-tinted grass. Little Judy was elated at the dignity of her possible position, and fascinated by its impressiveness. She was not astute, poor little woman ! What was of her was very simple and wholesome. But then what follies will cross the brain 01 seventeen ! To be her own mistress, to gad about and patronise her cousins and Honor in place of being patronised by them, was a tempting prospect. To be petted by the rosy, portly Torney, to romp with his youngsters, and give them all manner of treats, and in return to be adored by them, was the very height of her ambition. It was sometimes dull enough for Judy at French Town. The other girls were sometimes engaged or cross, and would snub her ; Grace was domineering when she took it into her head ; Die was silly with her affectation ; and Honor was grave, and always busy with her quilting and embroidery \u2014 for she constantly said she did not know how she might need to apply her talents, and Judy, she insisted, should sit still, and learn to weave lace now that she was a big girl. Judy in reality was a slim, agile doll, with a pouting mouth, and black eyes easily made to stare with wonder and sparkle with delight. But Honor might live with young Mrs. Dillon, and make the best match in Galway ; for, though Honor was not a beauty, she was decidedly charming, pretty with an in describable prettiness ; and if she made such a match she would never require to sew, unless for pure pleasure. Ju ly simpered over the overtures of Torney Dillon, and listened approvingly while Diana argued that as he"], [351, "Judy 339 had been kind to his lost wife, he must be fond of her successor. Old men always spoiled young wives, she averred. Then Torney was not so very old either, not above five -and -fifty, though he was stout and bald about the temples when he did not set forward his wig. He was so sweet tempered, and his seven children were turning his house upside down in such a manner that the poor man was hurried a second time into matrimony for sheer protection. Judy, not much wiser than a baby, with no experience of household management, auda ciously prepared to mend these matters. She agreed, in the prettiest flutter, to go to town in the car next day with Mistress Diana, and meet Torney Dillon at Mrs. Ganet's shop in Fishgate Street, just that they might look at each other, and exchange a few words on the arrangement before they announced it to their friends and the public. II. \u2014 THE SHOP IN FISHGATE STREET. Judy's heart of course was beating when she entered the little glove-room in the deep archway with the vaults beneath belonging to the old wine firm in Fishgate Street. The locality had its own singularity. It was cool on a summer's day, because Fishgate Street led to the Claddah, and beyond the Claddah was the pride of Galway, the great Bay with its breakwater of islands, and beyond them again that enchanted isle, the Isle of the Blest, for eyes that could see it. The fisherwomen of the Claddah, with their red cloaks and great gold wed- Z 2"], [352, "Days of Yore. 340 ding-rings, and their loads of cockles and salmon in the season, passed constantly, stepping out gallantly, and jesting as only Irishwomen can jest. But in addition, that coast-town which had dealt for centuries back with Granada and Malaga, had borrowed the well-like caverns of their wide shady entrances, from which opened offices, broad stairs, and courts which might have had their fountains in their day. But, oh dear! you could never have fancied the big brothers Garret playing guitars there. The big brothers Garret belonged to one of the innumerable families on Irish soil who kept their ground by merit and courtesy. Their mother was a woman of parts and literary taste, and could boast a drop of the O'Connor blood in her veins. But letting that drop go, the Garrets were one of the old wine firms that had traded with Spain for a century. The unfortunate thing was that the firm had declined with the decline of the wine trade, and had lapsed into a ruinous state. On the death of its late head, his widow, a lively, enterprising little woman (for she was not much bigger than Judy Butler), had to bring up these three big brothers, Dennis, Lucius, and Mike, mostly by her wits. Mrs. Garret wrote inflated poems, and published them by subscription : got plays acted for her, and gathered together charity assemblies in her name ; and when these lines of livelihood failed her, she opened a branch of the Limerick glove trade in the room opening from the arched gateway with its coat-of-arms. The big brothers took after their mother in everything but size. They were as honest, as independent, as literary, and as poor."], [353, "Judy. 341 Dennis was a provision-merchant, Lucius a portrait painter, and Mike a surgeon. They lived on, these three brothers, in their combined eighteen feet of length \u2014 breadth being proportionate\u2014 and enjoyed their bachelor hood in the old house behind the glove-shop. The glove-room was not by any means the mosl imposing room in the old house, though it had its wreaths over the windows. There were ruinous empty rooms with brown wooden cornices which might have given a hint to the girls at their shell-work \u2014 nay, might even have suggested coral, tangle, great sea snakes, or wonderful dolphins to Lucius the painter. Lucius painted in one of these resounding chambers, whist ling and smoking an accompaniment. Mike, in another, mixed his drugs and pounded with his pestle, while in a third he would even set a fractured limb, or draw an aching tooth occasionally, calling in Dennis to hold, and scold, and coax the patient. Dennis again kept his store of cheese and bacon in a fourth chamber. The old family house was still a perfect hive. Vivacious Madame Garret, who made the best of everything, reflected that there was one good in her big boys remaining poor \u2014 they remained around her. The glove-shop had its packages of Limerick kids and lighter muslin gloves with cut fingers for warm weather, gloves that flourished both at church and at ridotto; its packages of thick warm mittens, with all the fingers stumped into one and a string to tie round the wrist, for countrywomen coming to market; and its packages of half-tanned gauntlets which the"], [354, "Days of Yore. 342 fishers sometimes bought. Mrs. Garret's leather-covered easy-chair and footstool, to which she was now mostly confined (for her small body was breaking down though her spirit had never flagged), stood in the middle of the shop. So did her tall narrow desk with the twisted legs ; her wheel too \u2014 for when she laid down the pen she twirled the thread with her shaking fingers. Placed close by were a flower-stand, and a cage with a scream ing bullfinch which belonged to Peg the servant, who was glad to see it in the place of honour. One or other of the big brothers Garret was generally snatching a moment to lounge on the counter, or on the back ot his mother's chair, or was musing in the middle of the arched entrance, or assisting cheerily in the sale of a pair of gloves. The ' Postboy ' newspaper found its way to the glove-shop sooner than to any other house in Galway, and it was usually read aloud by one of the brothers in an exaggeration of the Connaught brogue. There was an understanding between the Garrets and all the book sellers in the place. Broadsheets and playbills, damp from the press, flew in at the arched gateway. Young authors consulted Mrs. Garret, who entered into their affairs as if they had been her own. Pamphlets were concocted there, and squibs made ready for firing off; but it was well known that the Garrets would not lend a hand to anything scandalous. They were honest and fine-tempered men, as well as big-boned, and sanguine complexioned. Mrs. Garret, in her mob-cap and mode cloak, had a merry, clever, nut-cracker face. She was a mere bundle"], [355, "Judy, 343 of bones, and, alas ! stiff now with the rheumatism. Dennis boasted that he could lift her up between his finger and thumb. He had carried her to bed on occasion as carefully and tenderly as if she had been a \" cheeney baby.\" Mrs. Garret had a ludicrous, naughty perception of the wickedness of men from a mental point of view, but could not help entertaining to some extent the new and fallacious faith in the honour and love of the common brotherhood ; and this influenced her behaviour when she came into individual contact with them. Mrs. Garret knew Torney Dillon well. He was one of her warmest old friends, and she had many old friends in Galway. He was also a friend of the boys : had a great opinion of their characters and capacities, and would have done something for them if they would have let him. But there was something more than Irish in the self-respect and the moderation of the brothers Garret, though it would not have been easy to say whether it proceeded from their mother's ways, from their lengthened family union, from their being Wes leyans and Orangemen in the middle of a Roman Catho lic and Whiteboy town, or from their literary bias. Mrs. Garret was delighted to help Torney Dillon to another wife, and almost shook off her old head in thrusting it close to his aile de pigeon wig to whisper the prelimi naries. She was proud that he had arranged the meeting in her glove-shop ; she would keep the boys as much out of the way as possible, would take off the attention of customers, and talk to Diana French. She was quite"], [356, "Days of Yore. 344 ready to approve of Tomey's choice, and would not stagger him by malicious objections. Judy Butler, she knew, was a sweet pretty girl, with fine spirits and fine health, one that would grow into a fine bustling woman, keep the children in order, and put a little life into Torney when he was sodden with his papers, and also prove a capital nurse to him when he began to fail. She thought it was the top of a match for little Judy Butler too. Mrs. Garret was a charming confidante. Diana French only was to have come with Judy to relieve her feelings, and to allow her a little more chance of private conversation with her wooer. But luck was against her. Honor claimed a right to be present, and Honor so rarely claimed a right that Judy could not refuse her. Then the party had not turned the corner of Fishgate Street, when Captain Dillon strolled across the way, and handed them from the car, and of course accompanied them to the Garrets. And then Dennis Garret just at that moment walked in from the harbour where a provision ship had sailed an hour before its time. Judy could only take refuge in the confusion of numbers. As she said afterwards, it was like seeing Torney Dillon for the first time in her life. She hoped big Dennis Garret, and the woman who was getting away the gloves to stitch, might be relied upon as innocent and ignorant. Upon the whole, Judy found the process of being ushered into the degree of a person of conse quence, with its attendant conspicuousness, by no means an unmixed pleasure. She was sure she looked awkward. In trying to slip behind the door, she knocked over a"], [357, "Judy. 345 chair laden with packages of different kinds, whereupon Dennis observed that she would not be married this year, while Diana tittered, and Mrs. Garret inadvertently cried out \u2014 \" You're out there, my lad.\" Judy would be grateful for the fatherly consideration of Torney till her dying day. He went on setting to rights an unmanage able account of Mrs. Garret's, and took no notice of her, except by a profound bow, till she was cooler and more composed. Judy had time to think what a portly presence the Torney had even beside Dennis Garret. \" Mistress Judy,\" he said at length, \" can you fancy an apron?\" and he flung over a lot of silk embroidered aprons, and when she was too nervous to decide which she would like, he whispered \u2014 \" Child, take the best, or shall I order 'em all?\" So Judy had to try one on, and while Diana was buckling it by its girdle, he said again, pointing to the pockets, \" Some one must handsel them, Madam,\" and before she could prevent him, he dropped in something like a little stone, which was nothing less than a pearl ring that would match beautifully with Judy's pearl earrings. Judy curtsied very low, overwhelmed with Torney Dillon's generosity. He laughed and said, \"You are too grateful, you will thank me better by and by.\" After these proceedings Judy felt a little more at her ease. She could say that it was a great honour he put upon her, but did he know she wished to ask whether he would not find fault with her if she made great mistakes for a long while? And then she was curious as to whether Sally and Jack were agreeable."], [358, "Days of Yore. 346 Torney Dillon bent down and pinched her cheek, and muttered \u2014 \" Poor little dear, she thinks nothing of her self, and will breed no dispeace.\" Then he added very solemnly, that he would promise never to rue the day he would call Judy his wife, and that she might depend upon his faithful and tender affection. But she must think before she committed herself. He was not a young man, and had done with frolics himself, though he hoped he could allow for them in others. Perhaps he was stupid and dull often, as the children alleged; he was not so ardent or so agile as he had been, but he could not say that he felt his heart cold or his arm heavy for all that. There Judy interrupted him. \" Oh ! dear, no, and we will take great care not to disturb your nap after dinner. Sally and I will take that time for the garden. We will swing each other and the rest of the children, and pre pare a salad for supper till the tea is wet.\" Thus the couple chattered together, as if there had not even been a dozen years between them. Honor was talking apart to Mrs. Garret. The quick old lady had seen that Honor looked serious. \"She's none of your dogs in a manger,\" Mrs. Garret commented to herself; \" but I can roll the reel right in no time. Honor dear,\" aloud now, \"will you step round the counter ? I want to speak to you. Dennis boy, bring a couple of bottles of wine from the cellar, and send Peg to the tavern for a tray with meats. No denial, Torney, you must eat and drink on such a visit A slice of any thing they have, Dennis, and some baked meats and"], [359, "Judy. 347 sweets for the girls. Away with your bachelor's fare, sir, we're too proper here, and perhaps too far bespoken. Do you not understand bachelor's fare, Honor Butler ? Why, bread and cheese and kisses, to be sure ; but no one will kiss you, child, till the right one come. The right one has come to Judy \u2014 a mighty sine thing for her, isn't it ? Torney Dillon is a fine man for his years, sound at heart in spite of the law, as mellow as a ripe pear. He never had a word with his last, and she tried him. It is ill speaking harm of the dead, but she was vapourish. I warrant his cook-maid could say of the Torney : 'Which I'm sure I've been his servant four years since October, And he never called me worse than sweetheart, drunk or sober.' Why do you sigh so, Honor ? \" \" Because Judy is going to be his wife, not his cook maid, Mrs. Garret.\" \" Tut ! child, Judy's not you. No offence, Honor ; but the bit heart of her is as transparent as a looking glass \u2014 it has no cloudy spots, no misty corners. She is not passionate, does not cry for the moon. Kindness and plenty, and her beam of sunshine will be enough for her, the beauty. She'll strut like a queen in her silks and laces, she'll giggle like a country girl at evening hops, and the Torney will look on and clap his hands and see her wrapped up and carried home before she's quite knocked up. She'll be the married toast of the town, but she'll never forget to hem the Torney's cravats, and hear the children their prayers ; for although there is little of Judy, it is as good as gold, the darling.\""], [360, "348 Days of Yore. \" Such a charge, such a pack of children,\" bemoaned Honor, meditatively. \" Well, bother the children ! \" Mrs. Garret admitted candidly. \" There is a many of them, and none of the straightest growing, either ; they all ran to seed and have shot out anyhow since the poor mother went to a better place ; but, Honor, girl, the children must be brought up by somebody, and Judy has a young heart for the work, and a long life before her, please her Maker. Consider what would become of you two girls, with your trifle of a fortune, now that your poor brother Thady is gone, if Larry French were taken away. Don't spoil the play with your glumness. Rather be easy, and tell me what you've got to say to my ' Parley between a Flock of Sheep and their Shepherd.' That is meant for a certain gentleman and his poor racked tenants ; and the boys hold it is a settler.\" Honor was not inclined for the diversion, but she was a little comforted. Dennis Garret had returned from his mission. Peg, a middle-aged, hard-featured, faithful Irishwoman, jolly but opinionative, riled as she was by the mistress and her perennial boys, now reappeared. She deposited her tray on the counter, and coolly announced that she had judged it better on her own responsibility to have a chine of pork, and currants and gooseberries, as being more in season than baked meats and sweets. The litter was so far cleared away, stools were found for the ladies, and the gentlemen waited on them. None of them seemed to mind that the entertainment was in a"], [361, "Judy. 349 public shop, and that the customers, even the passers by, could see through the open door that the Garrets were treating their gentry friends. It was their unceremonious way. But Honor Garret smelled kid-skin all through the feast. It was a curious fact that grey-eyed, low browed Honor, who was proud nowhere else, always grew haughty as if there was an enemy in the camp when she was in the company of Dennis Garret ; while Dennis, the finest tempered of the brothers, as invariably taunted her with squeamishness. An epitome of the conversation in the glove-shop shows that its aim was smartness, and that it was apt to be pert, impudent, or silly, according to the speaker. Gentlemen and ladies might not believe that so many stock phrases served their ancestors for wit, and that what they are accustomed to consider the Cockney brusqueness of their waiting-maids and serving-men, was in vogue along with the taking of snuff and flirting of sons. But depend upon it, that while Belinda played quadrille, she also spoke this dialect. They all spoke it more or less along with the eating and the drinking at the Garrets'. It was spoken by the dissipated beau, Captain Dillon, and the languid belle, Diana French ; by Judy, in her childish tatter; by Torney Dillon, in what I protest was his manly, vigorous, and humorous condescension ; as well as by Dennis Garret, and his quick old mother; and by dignified but arch Honor Butler. Captain Dillon would ask, \" What news?\""], [362, "350 Days of Yore. Mistress Diana would take him off softly, \" Queen Elizabeth's dead.\" Dennis Garret would cry to Honor, \" Come, Miss \" (I am afraid he called her just Miss), \" a penny for your thought.\" And even sensible Honor was so far left to herself as to reply, \" It's not worth a farthing, Sir, for I was think ing of you.\" Mrs. Garret would press Judy to eat more currants after Judy had picked at them like a bird, and she would answer, \" No, thank you, Ma'am, ' enough is as good as a feast ! ' \" The old lady nodded, and warned her, \" Well, but, Judy, if you always say No, you'll never get married ; and promises are, like pie-crust, made to be broken,\" sending Judy off in a titter, which so nearly raused her to choke that Torney Dillon had to pat her anxiously on her back before she got over it. You must excuse that company, good folks of the present generation. They did not invent their barbarous witticisms, nor did the writer, nor the great man who collected them, and got them set up in type. They were the staple small change of the society in which these men and women lived. And for all that poor banter, Torney Dillon did a good stroke of business that day ; and Judy Butler left the old house in Fishgate Street his affianced wife. If any man can conduct his wooing to-day so speedily and on as simple principles, with so little waste of time, and so great practicality on both sides, he must be at once a clever and a lucky man."], [363, "Judy. 351 111. \u2014 judy's welcome home. Judy's wedding clothes were bought, and Judy was married off hand. But Larry French had his hermitage finished, and his shelf and his hermit's book and leather bottle were all ready for the admiration of the wedding guests ; and Mrs. French had got her last hay crop well in just the day before. Judy was on her way home in the yellow po'-shay with the Torney by her side, and Honor, in compliment to the occasion, opposite them. Honor's company was no intrusion ; well brought up brides did not travel without the countenance of their \" best maids.\" Besides Judy and the Torney were not likely to have confidences in which Honor could not share. Honor was useful to chat reasonably with the Torney ; for Judy was such a young thing \u2014 she was only fit to play with the children or to be played with by the Torney himself when his day's work was done. The great disparity between bride and bridegroom was no offence ; it was rather a crowning charm in the eyes of the populace. \" Luck to her, the darling ! She ran after the young lapwings on the sea-braes, and danced on the kitchen floor to Corney Blane's pipes, not twelve months agone. And now she's second wife to Torney Dillon with a big business and a power o' child ren.\" Judy herself would not have felt half so proud it she had only married a philosophic thirty-year-old bachelor like Dennis Garret, or a dashing, doubtful twenty-five-year-old prodigal like her nephew Captain Dillon. Judy held up her head as proudly when the"], [364, "Days of Yore. 352 Captain called her aunt as she expected to do when the swarm of children in Lombardy Street styled her mother and the servants Madam. Judy had only one cross. Sally Dillon had not been present at the wedding; she resisted the temptation to this merry-making\u2014 had stayed away, and enticed Jack also to absent himself. Children were treated as child ren then, so that the younger ones in Lombardy Street were not taken into account. But Sally had come near the years of discretion, and her behaviour had been alarmingly backward and lowering ever since the an nouncement of her father's marriage. It was true she had an uncertain temper ; but in this instance she had been very persistent. The Torney tried to conceal all this, and though Sally did not venture to oppose him openly, neither did he pretend to control her entirely. This perversity on Sally's part made some impression on Judy, and she would rather not have ventured into the large house in Lombardy Street, even with its mature master at her back without having her composed, frigid Honor's hand to lay hold by. This made the single qualm in Judy's heart. At a lonely part of the road where the chaise passed the bluff shoulder of a hill whose spur ran up into Con nemara, a crowd of ragged men came suddenly round them, impeding their progress and demanding charity. They spoke loud and importunately, in a tone which corresponded better with the bludgeons in their hands than the humility of their petitions. For a moment Judy trembled, and grasped the Torney's arm, while he"], [365, "Judy. 353 flushed and frowned, and looked a good deal older, and a vast deal sterner, than when he looked on Judy. He would not be compelled into bestowing alms. \" Get away with you,\" shouted a postboy, \" it's Torney Dillon's wedding-party. Would you delay a bridal shay for your wants, you unmannerly boors ? \" \" We want none of your sauce,\" was the unanimous response ; \" but sure it's their day now, and if you'll just let us have a sight of the bride, we'll let you pass on, and cry hoorah for Torney Dillon and his lady.\" Poor rogues ! they had a soft sentimental bit about them. \" It is Cadenus Burke's cleared-out tenants, Honor,\" said Torney, apologising for finding a handful of small silver, and pulling forward blushing Judy to the window. Judy did not soon tire thinking of the cheer then raised, the pistol-shots and waving of flags that followed, the curious faces thrust forward, and the glib blessings be stowed. Reaching Lombardy Street, they found there was a great crowd already gathered to greet Torney and his young bride. Old and young were there, ragged and whole elbowed, country knitters and town vendors ot cakes and apples ; gossoons from pig-driving up the country, and fishers and fisherwomen; well clad quill drivers from offices such as Torney Dillon's, and traders from old houses of business like the Garrets'. What a field was now open to Judy's appetite for admiration and renown ! Still the girl was not par ticularly greedy or selfish. She was contented with simple pleasures ; she was pleased when a grateful voice A A"], [366, "Days of Yore. 354 called out \u2014 \" Torney Dillon never said No to a poor man's petition without putting his hand in his pocket and saying, ' I cannot take up your business, Job, or Dan ; but there's for you.' \" But Judy was most elated of all when a comprehensive-minded member of the assembly demanded one cheer more for the young lady who accompanied the Torney and Madam Dillon. \" They're cheering for you, Honor,\" she said. \" Do you not hear them? Torney dear, please do throw them some more money.\" The publicity was to end at the Torney's door. In consideration of Judy's youth and the Torney's recent widowhood, the gathering of friends and groaning supper were dispensed with, and a family tea for the happy couple and Honor was to be the wind up. The Torney flattered himself that he was doing things discreetly, as he had Judy in the privacy of his own hall now, and was introducing her to the bowing and scraping servants. But just then the ears of the party were saluted by unaccountable sounds, \u2014 creaking, rattling, cracking, and shrill shouting, \u2014 intimating the opposite of respectful preparation, repose, and expectation. The Torney paused for a moment, listened doubtfully, and then looked deprecatingly at his wife and her sister. \" The children are unruly and noisy when left to themselves,\" he observed ; \" but surely Sally and Biddy might have had them more in hand to-night, were it only to convey a favourable impression to begin with, and to insure you a little comfort after your ride.\" \" Oh ! \" answered Honor, coming to the rescue,"], [367, "Judy. 355 \" every reasonable person would make great allowance for children. I suppose this is their mode of celebrating the occasion.\" But Honor all the while thought within herself, \" Have these poor things no friends to teach them proper behaviour? I would not be little Judy for the world.\" The noise waxed worse and worse, and the moisture stood on the Torney's forehead with sheer anxiety. All at once there was stillness, broken only by a confused murmur. Honor's painful feelings were intensified by reflections about the house, which was not decked and garnished waiting for the bride ; and about the children, who did not stand in shining faces and combed hair to be led forward in turn by Torney to kiss the eager young girl, their new mother. Instead, a litter of furniture stood in the passage, and every door was open ; but not a creature appeared save a distracted-looking woman in a chintz gown so pinned up as to expose her bare feet. The Torney was a pacific man ; but he stamped his foot, and his face grew pale as he appealed to this woman, Biddy, and asked her the meaning of this state of the household ; the two girls, white-faced and wonder ing, standing meanwhile behind him. Biddy put the tail of her chintz gown to her eyes, and, gently rocking herself, began to mourn that his honour should have arrived with his young lady to surprise them while the house was in such confusion. Then she flew off at a tangent, calling down a thousand blessings A A 2"], [368, "356 Days of Yore. on sweet, lovely young Madam Dillon : \" May roses spring beneath her feet in this weary house, and all the thorns be left for poor Biddy, and them as deserves thorns ; \" and then she smiled and bobbed a succession of curtseys. \" What is the cause of this up-turn, Biddy ? \" insisted Torney, leaning against the wall, and, as Honor thought, afraid to go farther, notwithstanding his portliness and his legal standing. \" Did I not direct you to have everything in good trim ? What do you all mean by this indecorous and most unfeeling couduct?\" \" True, Torney, you did everything right, and behaved like a gentleman about extra charring and drink-money. But what could we do when Miss Sally withstood us to our teeth, and said she was mistress here till you came back, and would perhaps be mistress after it? No farther gone than this day she ordered me to have her mother's chest of drawers and card-tables carried out, and put up into her room. Master Jack had the company rooms torn down anyhow; and their mother's gownds were taken out and aired, though I told Miss Sally it was enough to give her new mother a turn. Miss Sally would send down to the shore for cockles and shrimps, and all the childer would be at the boiling, and roasting, and eating of them. And then, Master Jack, he went out to the harbour, and got himself treated in a foreign vessel, and came in half says over, and would have us all to play a game at cards with him, and myself was glad to humour the boy tc coax him to lie down on a table, and take a sleep to bring him to his senses again.\""], [369, "Judy. 357 The Torney waited to hear no more ; but strode forward, drawing Judy after him, and leaving Honor to follow. In the square room which had such a glorious view of the bay, the children were at their pranks, encouraged and abetted by the older ones. They were making short work with the little stock of spruce furni ture which could not fill up the yawning gaps left by the displacement of sundry heavy articles, and which had been merely intended by the Torney to render his old battered family room a little more in keeping with the fresh presiding goddess. Norah and Phelim were making hobby-horses of the chairs ; Lily had her cat and dog immured in folds of the Turkey carpet, Phil and Madleen were wrapped round by ends of the pale blue damask curtains. The overturned flowerstand was in the middle of the floor, and a bracket of French Town shell-work which Judy had proudly packed up, and sent in beforehand, was torn down and crushed to fragments. The children were in their morning dresses, coarse linen sacques sorely dabbled ; their heads were frowsy with a day's violence ; and their faces smirched with the relics of three meals. Surrounded by the hubbub, two young persons showed themselves. A lanky lad, in the flushed and blear-eyed unbecomingness of Biddy's account, lounged on a settee, and a girl a little older than Judy, broad-shouldered, and with a squarish face, sat in rusty mourning, her hands over each other. \"Sally,\" called Torney Dillon, reproachfully, \"and Jack, what are you doing here ? \""], [370, "358 Days of Yore. Jack stumbled to his feet, looking ill-conditioned, slovenly, awkward, and half mazed. But Sally rose up with a spiteful gleam in her green hazel eyes. \" What is it, father dear? You know such a position is strange to me. Tell me how I should pay my duty to Mrs. Dillon. I am willing to install her into office at once,\" and, so saying, Sally lifted up and jingled ostentatiously a large bunch of keys at her elbow. Judy sank into a chair, and could not help crying; but she protested magnanimously, \" I'm only tired, Torney \u2014 I'm sure all the children will come and kiss me by and by.\" \" You are a little angel ! \" poor Torney gallantly whispered ; \" compose yourself for my sake.\" And he stood and fretted in helpless mortification. Honor had to exercise great restraint not to yield to her impulse to say, \" Whip the children tightly all round ; lock Jack and Sally into their rooms, and feed them on bread and water for a day or two.\" But, instead, she only suggested that the children should be sent to bed, and that no further notice should be taken of the vagaries of Jack and Sally. And then she went on in a gayer tone : \" Biddy or Katy will soon put things to rights. The cups and saucers will be got out in a trice, and we'll be laughing over our dish of tea as soon as we have got our hats off. It is an unfortunate affair, but it breaks no bones.\" Judy sat up and smiled again at the firm cheerful voice, and the Torney turned round to the intrepid serene adviser greatly relieved."], [371, "Judy. 359 IV. HAVE A WIFE AND RULE A WIFE. Judy came young to the heavy work of a stepmother; but what she wanted in experience she made up in light ness of heart. That first scene could not be repeated with all its force : Sally was cowed by her father's presence, Jack was an unlucky lubberly fellow, with an undesirable habit of stumbling into scrapes, and was innocent on the wh~'_ ,vhen he was not Sally's tool. As for the younger children, they were merely very spoiled neglected children, who ate twice as much food, wore twice as manj clothes, and fell into ten times as many accidents and offences as other children. Judy soon got used to the house in Lombardy Street and its inmates, and some of the inmates took to Judy. The Torney was very kind, and Judy was almost as happy as she had hoped to be. It was a pleasant sight to see her sitting in her paduasoy, with her clear lace handkerchief, and her ruffles, and her clustering black curls, receiving the magnates of Galway, or going out visiting with the mild manly Tomey, to be admired by her new relations, and by crowds of honied gracious Irishmen and women. She was even proud of the children, especially when they were out of sight and hearing. As a young married woman is profuse in allusions to \" my husband,\" or \" my maids,\" or \" my house,\" Judy judiciously crowned these simple boasts by \" my children,\" and in a way too that would have made a grave judge laugh. Judy, however, got into a few troubles, with which"], [372, "Days of Yore. 360 Sally had something to do. One day the Torney had invited a number of other torneys, counsellors from Dublin, and country gentlemen, to dinner, and, of course, wished everything to be in good style. The cook, Molly, was that day seized with an inexplicable illness, and Judy was half taken up attending to her, half occupied with her own dress, and, shocking little housekeeper as she was, almost forgot about the dinner. The collared pig was all in a heap, grilled salmon lay red-raw, the orange butter was melting before the fire, at the time the meal should have been served to the good clients and brethren of the law from Dublin, only too ready for a catch against their host. Torney's face grew purple with vexation and chagrin. Judy was like to cry, perhaps she did cry, and hide a quick shower of tears as she bent her head and pretended to trifle with the etui at her girdle. But the Torney commanded him self nobly, and with sheltering tenderness said, \" Gentle men, I've got a young housekeeper. You'll forgive her this once.\" Luckily Honor, Judy's good genius, had stepped in before dinner ; she bent towards the Torney and said that they happened to be great in steaks, and that if the gentlemen would have patience for ten minutes she thought all would be well. She then rose briskly from the table. In eight minutes and a half there were delicious juicy steaks of beef and salmon on the table, and such blackberries and cream that one of the counsellors proposed for Honor the same evening, and went back to Dublin with a fly in his ear, because Honor declared that she was in no hurry about being wed."], [373, "Judy 361 Honor, unluckily, was not present when Judy met with another misadventure, and the young wife had to find her way out of it by her own exertions. Judy was at an assembly to which the Torney could not go. He would meet Judy in the supper-room, and take her home. The Torney appointed the hour, and requested punctuality, but Judy was very much engaged, and Sally misled her as to the time, so that she failed in her appointment. The Torney encountered nobody in the supper-room but his daughter Sally, who announced that he was beyond his time, and that she supposed her mother had gone home without waiting for him. Away went the Torney, but no Judy was in Lombardy Street. He was perplexed and aggrieved, and was again on the pavement, when up came Judy escorted by half-a-dozen fine young gentlemen with walking rapiers. But Judy uttered such a cry of joy on seeing the stout stately figure, and tucked herself so closely under his arm, and took blame to herself so promptly, that the Torney lost tight of the scolding he had been rehearsing, and only said, \" Never mind, little one,\" adding afterwards, \"Why did you put yourself out of breath ? \" Judy was so sweet; in that indeed lay the danger. The Torney's big heart now began to thrill to influences he had never felt before. He grew exacting, suspicious, nervous, jealous. He fancied that there was also a change in Judy. She had become restless, variable in her spirits, startled when he chanced to come suddenly upon her, and even inclined to shun him. Her conduct to Sally was likewise altered. Judy was a good girl, and"], [374, "362 Days of Yore. had derived benefit from Honor's strict principles and good sense. When Judy experienced outbreaks of sauciness and folly from Sally, and saw how she de ceived her father, she tried to prevent the continuance of this wrong-doing. But it seemed now that Judy let Sally go her own way, was frightened, and even connived it her wilfulness ; while Sally, hard and cunning, was not jnly aware of this advantage, but kept it no secret, and daunted it in her father's eyes. It is no exaggeration to compare love to the sting of the nettle, or to say there is no passion so near it as hatred. These two passions are twins. The Torney had known what peace was when he merely cherished a generous, condescending liking and forbearance towards the middle-aged, self-engrossed, splenetic woman who had been the partner of his youth. In a certain sense, Torney Dillon's first wife had her revenge. The autumn evenings were drawing in, when one night the Torney walked into his parlour, and was disappointed to hear the old uproar which Judy could subdue a little by her fairy tales and her ingenious snip pings in paper. The Torney missed Judy, who had lain down with a headache before he repaired to his office, and who had not recovered as he had hoped. Sally sat in Judy's chair, and fretted her father by putting on airs of welcoming and entertaining him. He was glad, however, to comply with her hint to have a walk by the Bay on this fine harvest evening, when there was a deal of company abroad. Sally was so modest and quiet as she hung upon her"], [375, "Judy. 363 father's arm in her mantua and Scotch cap, that he was agreeably surprised. Indeed, he was continually re proaching himself for the constant aching regret that the figure and the face so near him was not his darling Judy's. He had half a mind to turn back and ask if the air would not do her head good, when Sally tired of her promenade of her own accord and proposed to walk home again by the quieter lanes. Torney did not care that he left the world behind him, though he might well have wondered at Sally's taste. There was only another couple like them to be seen among the ordinary fisher and harbour population. The lady was in a capot and a caleche, and the gentleman in a three-cornered hat. They were some distance before the Torney and his daughter, but Sally was so anxious to reach home in case her mother or the children should want anything, that the couple in the rear gained rapidly on the couple in front in the rosy dusk. They were soon within a few yards of the two figures. The Torney's eyes were fixed as if by fascination, and his breath now came as quickly as Judy's did when she missed him on the night of the assembly. It was Judy. He could not mistake the light figure, the wave of the dress, and the turn of the head. He thought he knew her companion also. He was a man of six feet, with crisp chestnut hair on a head massive and erect. Sally continued to chatter with affected guilelessness, making no remark on the pair before them, till they were within sight of the door in Lombardy Street"], [376, "Days of Yore. 364 After a moment's pause, Judy turned into the house, and her companion walked on. \" Goodness, who can that be, father? Is it my aunt Phil, or Miss Honor Butler, come to town ? \" The Torney did not answer her. He moved on like a man in a dream. When he reached the house he walked straight upstairs to the parlour, while Sally ran after him nimbly, but lingered to make faces and shrug her shoulders at the parlour door. Sure enough it was Judy who stood there in her capot, leaning on the table and resting herself. She started timidly, and the blood rushed into her face at the Torney's entrance. She burst out hastily as if to allay suspicion and to defend herself from an unspoken accusation, pouring out her words, though she had a little catch in her throat and a slight tremble in her voice : \" My head got better, sir, almost well, and I thought the air would remove the pain altogether.\" \" I hope it has done so, Judy,\" said the Torney, very low; and stood waiting, waiting \u2014 but in vain. There came no further confession, and a weight like lead de scended on the Torney's heart. It was unutterably painful for him to suspect Judy. It is true he might easily have satisfied himself of her innocence or blame by cross-examining her in his lawyer fashion ; but he could not do it. He would rather live with the sword hanging over his head, though he felt it pricking him at every step, and draining his life blood by drops. The urbane old Torney acted with peculiar changeableness, and indeed seemed quite a different man under the trial."], [377, "Judy. 365 Now he looked at Judy with a kind of pathetic tender ness, and loaded her with a wild excess of gifts, as if he would win her back to him in spite of herself; now he frightened her by his distance, reserve, and gloomy expression. The last ridotto for the season in the tea gardens drew nigh. Any gentleman by paying his moidores could take two ladies to it. The Torney this time never talked of going, and never asked Judy, as he would have done in the earlier days of their marriage, if she should like tc go. Even when he saw a ticket to the ridotto on the mantel-piece he made no allusion to it. The Torney was in a silent, sullen mood, and poor little Judy could not venture to make up to her portly pre-occupied elderly husband. At dinner that day she alluded in a weal cowardly way to her intention of going to the ridotto with the mayor's wife, an old friend of the Butlers and the Frenches, and one of the most staid women in the town. The Torney must have heard Madam Fortescue make the proposal to Judy, and had had an opportunity of entering an objection. But he didn't raise any, neither at that time nor when Sally demurely delivered the mes sage, \" Mother bade me tell you that she had gone to the ridotto, but you need not trouble to fetch her home, for she was to go and come with Madam Fortescue.\" The last bit was an ingenious addition of Sally's own, as she omitted to inform her father that Judy had asked and even entreated her to accompany them. The Torney sat for a few moments gloomy, his brow lowering, as unlike as well could be to the old dignified"], [378, "Days of Yore. 366 indulgent Torney. Then he suddenly exclaimed with an assumed gaiety, which was but a bitter mockery, \" Hey, Sally, I think you and I will go a pleasuring, too. We wall have a frolic on our own account, my girl. Fling on your finery, and we will be off to the ridotto with the rest of the dashers.\" Sally professed unbounded astonishment and lasting gratitude, and was ready at once to cast aside her darn ing, not to keep her father waiting, \u2014 the model indeed of a considerate, obliging daughter. It should be remembered, however, that hid under her darning were Judy's house accounts, which she had filched, and among which she was prowling with no good intentions. So away went father and daughter to the tea gardens, where the chaste, cold September moon was shining down among coarse yellow oil lamps, on false cascades and grottos, on dancing greens and shady alleys, and on quiet secluded seats. The ridotto was frequented by a mixed company. It was in fact the provincial Ranelagh or Cremorne. The Torney's wits seemed wool-gathering as he walked through the gardens. His dress was in disorder, his air was agitated, he pushed recklessly forward, notwithstand ing that Sally clutched his arm. He seemed as though he were seeking something and must reach it or die in the search. The card players in the alcoves, and the romping groups dancing to the band of the Royals or the Militia, looked after the respected Torney wonderingly. There at last was Judy. The Torney set his teeth like a vice, and gazed grimly on the young girl, who, without"], [379, "Judy. 367 a vestige of Madam Fortescue near her, walked in the most retired walk in the gardens, and listened intently to the big, bending young man easily recognisable in his plain brown coat. Sally had got tired of keeping up with her father's long strides, and besides she had matters of her own to settle. So she had slipped from his arm, and vanished some time ago. The Torney was alone, and stood like a pillar of salt in the dark shadow of one of the trees. Backwards and fonvards, backwards and forwards, the big man who was so vile a seducer, the little girl who was so cruel, yet so artless a deceiver, passed and repassed under the eye of the unsuspected witness. At length the two parted. The Torney cursed his folly in trusting her. He would have guarded his trea sure, carried it to his own door, and been willing to have lifted it in his arms and borne it thus to the same resting place in his bosom. But this favoured man, in his flower of manhood, and for whom so much was risked, did not so much as touch her hand, as he waved a cavaliei adieu. But the coast was now clear to the Torney. He advanced to Judy with swift strides. He did not now heed her sharp cry as of a scared bird, he who would have heeded her softest word a few weeks ago, and cared for and soothed and fondled her. He told her roughly to come with him, and would not listen to her when she asked what she had done. She sobbed and wept and prayed him to have pity on her, and she would tell him all, but he did not stop or falter. These words of hers"], [380, "368 Days of Yore. only rendered him the fiercer. He left Sally to her own devices. As they went along he nodded gruffly to their acquaintances, all the while holding the poor little thing by the tender wrist. The sedan in which the Torney had brought Sally was still at the gate as he had ordered. He put Judy into it, half dead with terror and dismay. When it stopped at her own door she saw that he had not walked all the way by its side, but had turned off and hailed a return chaise which was following them. It also drew up at their own door. The Torney took Judy's cold clinging hand in his, which was also very cold and damp ; but his rueful eyes never once met her wan and piteous face, and as she walked towards the house door, he drew her aside, and said, with a heavy sigh, \" Not there, Judy \u2014 never, never more.\" He then handed her into the chaise, closed the door, gave the driver a fresh direction, \" To Mr. French, of French Town,\" and the chaise rattled off with its light yet heavy burden. Torney Dillon entered the house, which was now empty with a dreary, ghastly emptiness, though it held his sleeping children, and though Jack would open the unbolted door, and Sally would skip over the threshold after having been set down by Mrs. Fortescue, or some other tried matron, before the dawn."], [381, "Judy. 369 V. \u2014 HONOR BUTLER AND DENNIS GARRET, AND THE MUSHROOM-GIRL. The Torney's contemporaries were wont to let blood in their passionate revenge ; and the Torney's humour was sufficiently savage not to have baulked this old custom but for one consideration : he could not expose Judy. He might give out some likely excuse. Their tempers were discordant, or her health would not agree with the town air of Galway. He might even be forced to leave the story a suspicious mystery. But he would not hold up Judy to public scorn. She might have only entered on the road to ruin, and have saved everything except his faith ; but that was now gone for ever. If she had not been the very delight of his old eyes, his ewe lamb, he might have kept her still, remonstrated with her, and chid and controlled her levity and recklessness of spirit ; but he could not do so, love was so nigh to hate with him. Torney would have died to conceal Judy's shame. The tempter and traitor should sooner go scatheless, and preserve un dimmed the false lustre of his high, manly character, rather than that the Torney should do aught to publish Judy's crime. And instead of letting out another's blood, he himself had to submit to the doctor's lance, and next day a paragraph appeared in the ' Post boy,' deploring the illness of a person of such considera tion as Torney Dillon. The Torney sat among his clerks and papers, a sick and weary man. He had one consolation ; he thought B B"], [382, "Days of Yore. 370 to himself, \" I was not her match, but it will kill me all the sooner for that. A young fellow would get over it, but it is breaking me up already, and she will soon be free.\" He could not go upstairs, although unfit for business. He durst not face the blankness, and the crowd of sad associations ; could not meet Sally's pert questions and inquisitive surmises, or bear the clamour of the thoughtless children. He was forced to go into the best parlour, however, when he was told that a person wanted to speak to him there. Who was it ? He would not stir without knowing the name. It was Miss Honor Butler. He guessed as much, though he would a hundred times rather have braved his old acquaintance Larry French at this crisis than Miss Honor. She was standing in the middle of the room when he entered, and, without even saying \"Good day!\" she addressed him straight, \" What has Judy done, Torney Dillon?\" It was one of the strangest pangs to Torney that Honor should thus come between him and Judy, should interfere in Judy's behalf as if Judy's interests could be to another what they were to him, wronged and outraged in intention as he believed himself. \" Take a seat, Honor ; I don't blame you ; I know you could not help it.\" But she still stood resolutely where she was. \" What has Judy done ? You sent her back to me last night stunned with sorrow, and affronted ; and she will not tell me the cause.\" \" Why is your Uncle Larry not here, Honor? I would"], [383, "Judy. 371 rather deal with him,\" the Torney said rather proudly, grasping the back of a chair the while. \" Uncle Larry and Aunt French are as vexed as they can be, and they will seek justice for their niece; but Judy is only their niece, and she is my young sister. Torney Dillon, by the Heaven above us, what has Judy done ? \" Then he had no choice but to tell her, though the words crimsoned his forehead, and seemed to blister his lips. Honor stood listening without support, and never blenched till he mentioned the name of Dennis Garret \u2014 the man who had wantonly wrecked his home and his happiness. At the mere mention of the name Honor's olive face quivered, and a shiver passed over her frame as if she had heard the echo of a baleful step on the grave of her hopes and happiness. Honor offered no denial \u2014 how could she ? Nor did she say a word in palliation; she only said \u2014 \"Thanks to you, Torney Dillon, for telling me the truth,\" and she went out as she had come. Wearily did the Torney battle with his misery, but he felt it growing upon him all through the cool autumn day. He tried to escape wholly from Sally and Jack, and the children, and the amazed servants. The clerks at length left for their leisure and their pleasures, and he sat alone with his misery. He was conscious that it was not only taking the life out of his body, but breaking his heart, and bringing his spirit down to the dust. The Torney sat in the twilight leaning back in his B T, 2"], [384, "Days of Yore. 372 chair, mechanically grasping his spectacles in his hand, and looking at the dim outlines of the desks and safes and ledgers. He thought of Judy as he had seen her running on the beach and picking up the shells at French Town ; thought of her as she had met him, and nestled close to him, in the glove-shop in Fishgate Street. What fateful coincidence had induced him to fix on that place for their interview ? But the child was innocent then \u2014 he could take his oath on that \u2014 and that was some com fort. He would willingly have renounced all her sweet ness to have recalled the past, and given her, untouched by his doting fingers, and unstained by sin, to that young fellow, or any other her equal. She had tried to be contented with him, had been obedient and cheerful, had gleefully guided and played with the children ; the servants adored her, and were looking with rebellious eyes on her inexplicable absence and banishment to French Town. All but Sally loved her, and Sally was her enemy even before she had entered the house. Poor little Judy ! And then his eye caught the moon shining as it had done amid the crowd and folly of the last ridotto, on the little girl and the tall man holding their unblest tryst, and he thought of a few more such trysts and their results, and even shuddered at the thought. Out of the gathering darkness two figures suddenly presented themselves to the Torney. He had been so engrossed that he had not heard them enter, but he sprang to his feet, hurt as he was, when he distinguished that a man and a woman were beside him. It was the"], [385, "Judy 373 widow's son, Dennis Garret. Honor Butler had brought him in. and it was her who stood by his side. \"Torney Dillon,\" said Dennis, \" I believe you have a word to say to me. I thought you were a man, and that you would speak it out to my face.\" The Torney had never seen any of the Garrets punctilious before, and had never heard of any of them being stern. He had felt an inclination to seize the intruder by the throat, but he only stared at him with changing colour, sank back in his chair, shaded his facet with his hand, and muttered thickly, \" Say on, Dennis Garret.\" There was no hesitation, no mistake in the vehement conclusive language, though wistful sorrow was beginning to steal into the ruddy face and the clear blue eyes of the young man as he went on : \" You knew Judy Butler had a brother Thady, who was suspected of treasonable designs, and had to quit the country. You knew Thady had an uncle Terence, a ruined plotter, who tempted him, and succeeded in twist ing him to his own purposes. Thady never came back with his disgrace and his danger, to his friends' hearths, but Terence returned. He was in Galway here, lying concealed in Duffy's Lane, not a week ago. Your daughter Sally heard of him through some of her idle acquaintances, and between them they earned a message from him to his niece Judy. These people told your wife, at the same time, that you, Torney Dillon, would resent the outlaw's presence ; that you would never for give succour afforded to him ; and not only so, but that"], [386, "374 Days of Yore. the implied knowledge of his lying here might be your ruin with the authorities. Madam Dillon explained the perplexity and grief of the story, not to me, Torney Dillon, but to where she could not have gone better \u2014 to my mother, and my mother advised with her, and gave her good advice. She is a wise woman, my mother. She knew Lucius or Mike would give the best they had for Madam Dillon or any woman in trouble ; but my mother also knew that it was my life I would give to help Judy,\" said Dennis Garret, fearlessly, and casting a swift, keen glance at Honor, \" and she had good reason to believe I would die before I so much as soiled Judy's name in the business,\" and there was another burning glance at the woman by his side. \" I saw the rascal Terence, I gave him what he sought, and prevented him scheming for more. I counselled him to make the country rid of him, and put him on board an outward bound vessel three days ago. For this reason I saw your wife on two occasions \u2014 on the sands of the Bay to get her instruc tions, and to bid her tell you ; and at the ridotto last night, when I had to announce to her that Terence was gone. Now, Torney Dillon, what have you to say to me?\" \" Forgive me, Dennis Garret,\" said the Torney warmly, forgetting his lame arm, and holding out both his hands. \" I never wronged another man as I have wronged you ; you have lifted a load from my breast that was crushing me to the earth. I might have known your mother's son better, Dennis.\" The mask of pride and resentment had wholly fallen"], [387, "Judy. 375 from Dennis Garret's honest face. \" It is not I you need ask forgiveness of, Torney. If Honor Butler had not loved the truth, and never feared the truth, and come to me to seek it, you might have done me, as well as your self and the pure woman, gross wrong.\" And Dennis turned once more to Honor with an eagerness in his eye, his gesture, and the flush of his cheek. \" Ask Honor and Judy to forgive you, if you will.\" But the woman was less generous. Honor was already conjuring up before her mind inferences and demands she was not prepared to grant. \" It is Judy you have sinned against, Torney Dillon,\" she said, coldly and confusedly. \" It is not my business any farther than to clear her ; but,\" she added, \" I confess it would go hard with me ere I forgave such an offence.\" But Judy was not Honor. The Torney could hope for grace from Judy. Was he not ready to make atone ment, to admit the baseness of his jealousy, and to sorrowfully beseech his darling's forbearance? He was eager to fetch her home again, not merely to be his young wife to brighten his house as at first, but as his queen to reign over his heart. However, he could not for appearance sake drive out, and have Larry French come out to him in his night-dress, and armed with the poker, \" at three o'clock in the morning.\" Besides the Torney had one duty to perform before he reinstalled Judy at the head of the house in Lombardy Street. Ten minutes after Honor had been escorted by Dennis Garret back to the friend's house where she was staying, the Tomey marched up to the sitting-room"], [388, "Days of Yore. 376 with great decision. Sally was sitting there wasting the wax-lights and breaking the strings of the spinnet. He desired her to put on her hat and cloak instantly, as she and Biddy were to go by the night coach to their aunt in Limerick. Sally had no notion of an immediate change of quarters, and an overthrow of her spiteful, treacherous planning. Her aunt Phil was poor, saw little com pany, and was horribly strict with heedless, impudent, untruthful girls. Sally resisted strenuously, but the Torney was firmly resolved that she should go for the present, and should not return until she had learnt to behave herself better. Jack and the children might remain at home. Jack, with all his faults, did not bear Judy any ill-will \u2014 nay, he was rather inclined to like her ; as he had decidedly been the better of her ; and the poor irresponsible children were certainly not Judy's foes. The Torney was now certain that while he had breath none of them would be permitted to conspire against Judy again. His will was law when he liked to exert it, and Sally, in spite of her sulks and her tantrums, was forced to depart to sow strife elsewhere. The Torney was up betimes in the autumn morning. Its strong bracing air did him a world of good ; he vowed to himself he was as well as ever \u2014 nay, he felt himself young again. He was particular that day about his buckles and sleeve buttons ; and he made the boy powder his wig under his own eyes. The Torney was sipping his chocolate, and eating his fish, potatoes, gridle"], [389, "Judy. 377 cakes and preserves, taking an early breakfast, in expect ation of his post-chaise. He was roused from one of his intervals of self-accusation and sober remorse by a voice in the street below. The Torney had breakfasted two hours sooner than usual, so that there were few street cries as yet, and he could distinguish the voices of his children and of the servants in the distance, whenever he chose to listen. But it was not a street cry, nor the voices of children and servants, that sent every drop of blood at his heart wildly careering through his veins, only to ebb back again in a second or two, leaving his rosy face like chalk in his emotion. Yet the Torney had heard that voice frequently before ; it was a very clear, sweet treble that ascended to him through the open window. \"Please do you want any mushrooms?\" the voice asked hesitatingly. \"What may you be asking for them?\" responded Molly the cook, willing to haggle over the mushrooms, if not to buy them. \" You may have them at what you please, for I am not going any farther.\" \"No farther, mavourneen, and this but eight of the clock ! \" she answered somewhat in surprise. \" I am pressed for time, I cannot stay. Please is this Torney Dillon's house?\" \" The same, and I'm Molly his cook, by your leave. What may you be wanting, honey?\" \"How is the Torney, please? I saw in the prints yesterday\u2014 no, I didn't see it, but a lady read it out to"], [390, "378 Days of Yore. me \u2014 that he had been taken badly; is that true ?\" The voice came as with a sound of sighing anxiety. \" Wirrah ! what should he be but ill when there is a charm upon him ?\" replied Molly, hastily. \" I'll lay you a sixpence, Miss Sally had something to do with the putting it on ; but she has packed for it, that's one comfort.\" Molly was so intensely loyal to the heads of the house that she had no loyalty to spare for Miss Sally. \" But you have not told me how the Torney is,\" pleaded the young woman, anxiously ; \" you may have the mushrooms for nothing, because I am going no farther, and they cost me nothing. Please tell me how the Torney is, and let me go. I don't care to hear about Miss Sally and the rest. For goodness' sake, tell me, good woman. What does the doctor think ? How did the turn seize him?\" The Torney now saw that it was time to interfere before the fond inquirer betrayed herself in a deed after the very heart of Irish men and women, and which would cause them to adore the doer. He wished to have all the bloom of it for himself. He stole nearer to the window. He saw a slight figure, the face concealed in the great cloak and hood of a country girl, on the pave ment below. \" Molly,\" he cried, \" don't stand gossip ping there all the morning, Send up the mushroom girl to me, I wan't to look at her basket.\" \" Did any one ever hear of such interference ! \" cried Molly. \"What does he w\u201ent with the mush rooms ?\" But she conducted the mushroom girl up-"], [391, "Judy. 379 stairs. She seemed stunned, and stood still at every second step. The Torney dismissed the discomfited Molly, and closed the door. The little figure in the great cloth cloak, with the hood drawn forward like a pilgrim's, and the basket over the slender, round white arm, was trembling in every limb. The courtly old Torney in his dress suit was not so calm as when he made up the match in Fish gate Street. \" What makes you offer your mushrooms for nothing ?\" he asked her at length. \" Because they cost me little as I had them from a friend. I have come a good bit, and I have a good bit to go,\" faltered the girl. While she spoke, the Torney had taken up a japan patch-box, his wife's last pet piece of fancy work, and was forcing open its lid to the danger of its frail hinges. \" Oh ! take care, Torney,\" cried the mushroom girl. \"What do you know about the make of such fine things?\" he demanded somewhat roughly. He took one stride, and pulled down the cloak and hood : \" Judy, my child, you have saved me a long ride. But why did you come back masquerading thus ? Did you think I was angry still ? I was a fool and a tyrant, but it was all because I loved you so well, my little Judy. Now, I know all, and I ask you humbly to pardon me for my suspicions and my rashness.\" She was in his arms, her curly black head was lying on his broad, warm breast, and she patted the arm in the"], [392, "380 Days of Yore. sling with both her hands. She did not comprehend much about his asking forgiveness, or what suspicions he had entertained against her. She was still begging his forgiveness, and pouring out an innocent, incoherent rhapsody regarding the poor wretched traitor, Uncle Terence, her dead father's own brother, and how she could not bear to think of him starving and given over to justice to be tried and hanged like any common high wayman. She explained how hard bestead she had been, and how Mrs. Garret and Dennis Garret had advised her to make a clean breast 01 it to the Torney ; but some thing had been plaguing him before, and she could not break it to him. \" Did you come in this guise to break it to me now, poor little hare?\" jested the Torney, with wet eyes, as he shed aside Judy's black curls till the soft rings no longer concealed the candid sorehead. \" Troth, no, Torney,\" Judy answered naively, \" when I did not know that ye would receive me. But I thought I should die when I heard ye were taken ill and I away from you. I borrowed my foster-sister's cloak and her mushrooms, and I rose with the dawn ; for Honor being in the town I could do it easily. I walked all the way (don't groan, Torney, it never appeared so short when I rode it before, and sure, I am well rested now, I cannot feel tired where I am) ; I thought if you were very bad, Molly or Katy would let me creep up and sit down at your door, and perhaps your anger would die out as it has done, and that you would call me in, and that I would nurse you every moment till you were well again."], [393, "Judy. 381 But it is not true you are ill, Torney, were it not for this poor arm ; I never saw you braver or heartier. You have indeed thriven without your wife.\" \" That is all you know of it, Judy,\" said the good old Torney, a little ruefully, \" though you did walk these long miles and count them as nothing, because of your care for your old husband. The knowledge of that is setting his heart at rest, and breaking it with joy to-day, as it was breaking with sorrow yesterday. No, though your husband is old, and heady, and unreasonable, you have not been so unhappy with him that you would like to lose him, eh, Judy?\" \" Happy ! I was as happy as the day was long till you were unhappy, Torney,\" urged Judy fervently ; \" and I shall never be frightened at you now, sir. I shall never have a secret again in my life, \u2014 I have had my lesson ; I am not fit for secrets. Now, Torney, I am sure you don't want me to be masquerading any more. I must have my laugh at Molly; didn't I deceive her famously, though you were too clever for me ? I must empty my basket, for I have some clams underneath. I brought them hoping I should find an opportunity of giving them to my child Madleen. She cried after me the other night when I was forced to go to the ridotto, and I said she would have some shells to please her, and you know, Torney, a mother should keep her word to her children.
