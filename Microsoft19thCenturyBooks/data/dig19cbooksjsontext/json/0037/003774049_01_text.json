BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING. Two young men had been standing together in the morning-room of a house in Cadogan Place. The men were half-brothers, the day was the 7th of February. 1854, and the hour was 4 p.m. ; and there, when the dialogue ceased, which it did rather abruptly, and when the door had closed on the last and younger of the speakers, the elder, Colonel Henry St. John, was left alone, smoking in front of the fire. The time and the place of this conversation having been given, it only remains for me to add that the subject of it had been debt \u2014 debts to the amount of 780?., incurred by Philip St. John, and which he was"], [16, "4 VERA. incapable of paying on this or any future day : moreover (and this complicated the affair not a little), he was at this moment, as an ensign in the Grenadier Guards, under immediate orders to leave England for the seat of war in the East. I might enlarge in this place on his extravagance, and on the curious items which had, in a few months, swelled to such a total ; but I remember that when I used to tell stories to a bright-eyed audience in the nursery, that audience always cried out, \" begin at the very beginning ; \" and thus it may be as well in telling a story for children of larger growth to bear this hint in mind, and so perhaps interest the reader more genuinely in the fortunes of my hero. To begin then \" at the beginning.\" His father, the late Colonel the Honourable John St. John, was twice married. His first wife brought him a son within a year of tbeir marriage, and then, after some years of bad health, died, leaving her boy Henry, the hero of this book, to the tender mercies of servants, and of a widower of whom the world prophesied that he would not be long in consoling himself. But if, by this expression, a second marriage was intended, the world for once was wrong. The Honourable John St. John enjoyed his liberty for seven years, and he might per haps have continued to do so for seven years more, had"], [17, "5 BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING. not ruin overtaken him, and rendered it incumbent on him to look out for a wife with money. He found one \u2014 a Miss Heathcote, a very rich, foolish, and ill-advised heiress, who at twenty- one years of age bestowed her self and her fortune on the ex-M.P. for North shire. Not only was the Honourable John at that moment a bankrupt, but there had been some unfortunate circum stances connected with the fact, and with his career, which had made his own county what is vulgarly called \" too hot \" for him, and which had also had the effect of making his eldest brother's house as much too cold for him. In fact, Lord Kendal had simply refused to see his brother John again. The story had been a bad one, albeit a common enough, or a likely enough one. It was that of a rich young widow to whom he had paid great attentions. Mrs. Lindley was his junior, and still very attractive ; yet though her jointure was large she was not the less ruled by the two passions which finally brought about her undoing, she wished to increase her worldly goods by speculation, and she wished to obtain, and if needs be buy, a connection with the peerage. What sort of a stepfather the Honourable John St. John might make to her two boys was a minor consideration, I fear, with her ; but at all events she paid dearly for any hopes she had been led to entertain by him. Her money melted away"], [18, "6 VERA, in his larger speculations, her son's fortune was damaged, the big oaks and elms of his park had to be cut down, and eight months later, when she had gone to Bath to retrench, she had the pleasure of reading in The Times John St. John's marriage to the Miss Heathcote afore said. How that Miss Heathcote came to be so much left to herself as to marry a man who had lost a fortune, a character, a seat in Parliament, and the colonelcy of a yeomanry regiment, all within a year of making her acquaintance, I know not, only Miss Heathcote was young, and silly, and as obstinate as only a very silly woman can be, and so in Paris, at the chapel of the British Embassy, in May, 1835, she embarked in matri mony with this hero. With the details of their wedded life, not ahvays edifying, I will not weary the reader : suffice it to say that they were not such as to induce Lord Kendal to alter his opinion of his brother's con duct, and that two children were born to this couple \u2014 a daughter, born at Tours, Rue de la Scellerie, and christened Anne, and a son, also born at Tours, who received the name of Philip Heathcote. But how had it fared in the meantime through childhood, boyhood, and youth, with Henry St. John, the son, by the first marriage ? It had fared rather hardly as a child, and after that much less ill than might have been expected, thanks to the kindness of"], [19, "BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING. 7 Lord Kendal, who, taking a fancy to the boy, had sent him to school as soon as was possible after his mother's death. That school answered well, and Lord Kendal, of course, paid for it, but when Master St. John had outgrown the care of the very excellent lady in whose house he lived for three years, a painful interregnum then occurred in his education. It was mainly spent in France, and there it was that the young gentleman acquired that proficiency in foreign tongues, which dis tinguished him in later life ; but there he might also have learned many other, and less desirable things, both from his father and from his father's companions, had not Lord Kendal again interfered, and again bought the right to superintend the training of the lad. Miss Heathcote's appearance on the scene about that time had given the signal, it is true, for at least a ternporary reformation in his home, but Lord Kendal still forbade his brother the house, and the father and the step mother, in spite of that condition, were quite ready to hand over to the* peer the son, who was at least the pre sumptive heir to his title, and to the estates. Lord Kendal was a bachelor, a bookworm, and a recluse of so inveterate a kind, that he had built up the ground-floor windows of one side of the house lest he should be overlooked by the gardener's or the baker's boys ; and his life was as solitary as it was frugal. He"], [20, "8 VERA, kept a secretary, a stout cob, and a breed of mastiffs, for which Hurst Royal had long been famous : he wore a velvet cap, and smoked incessantly, and he lived in the county, not because he knew the pig from the cow, or a mangold-wurzel from a hyacinth, but because he liked pure air, large rooms, quiet by night, and learned leisure by day. In politics he defined himself a Tory, and he was a Churchman in theory, albeit not one in practice, as he did not attend the services of the Church, having taken umbrage in early life at the bad logic of the parson, the coughing of the children, and the southernwood nosegays of the old women. Many years ago, and when his brother John had been first returned for the county, he had taken some interest in politics, but that had been only ephemeral, the conduct of John St. John had been too discreditable, the electors had been found to be venal, and the agents to have faults more serious than were those of the curates and of the charitv children. He gave largely to local charities, but his temper was not the less of the kind euphuistically called difficult, namely, too difficult for its owner to manage, and very difficult for his neighbours always to steer clear of. The secret of Lord Kendal's celibacy was a quarrel with the only woman he had ever loved. He had been wrong in it, but he had (and perhaps for that very"], [21, "9 BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING. reason) kept it up with a firmness worthy of a better cause ; and thus, when he had shut the door some years later in his brother's face, his interests and sympathies, but for the existence of Master Henry, would have begun and ended in his library. The recluse's heart was thus sleeping, when at the age of fourteen the boy came to stir it, and to make the old house, the stables, the park, the mere, and the preserves ring to young voices and young steps. Lord Kendal was very indulgent to him. He would lay aside his great opus, \" The Lives of Great Men,\" a sort of modern Plutarch, which he was preparing, look at the contents of Henry's game-bag, and he even began to take an intelligent interest in ferrets, kingfishers, and stag-beetles, all parts of the animal creation which had never before been properly brought under his notice. He grew thus to experience some of the cares and pleasures of fatherhood, and more of its pleasures than of its cares, for the boy was handsome, docile, truthful, and clever. There is a theory that gout and madness often skip over one generation to reappear in the next, and in that same way, while passing over the Honourable John, of impe cunious memory, there really did seem to have descended to his son, the honour, the industry, and the self-control of the first, the lawyer Earl of Kendal. Harrow, and Christ Church followed each other for"], [22, "10 VERA. Henry, and then Lord Kendal bought a commission for his nephew, and sent into the Scots Fusilier Guards as fine a young fellow as ever wore her Majesty's uniform \u2014a very good-looking one, I may also add. A good deal above the middle height, well-knit and well-proportioned he looked very handsome in his uniform, and from under the fringe of his bearskin you saw dark blue eyes, regular features, and a very pleasant mouth. His hair was so dark that it might almost have passed for black, but that on the cheek, and above the mouth it had rich warm tints of brown. His voice, in speaking, was low and modulated, and he was naturally rather silent, though, perhaps, the least shy man in London. He explained this by saying that he had had to conquer all shyness as a lad. Much of his intercourse with his uncle had cost him an effort at first; and no wonder, since till you had gained, and knew that you had gained, his regard, Lord Kendal was indeed a very awe inspiring man. Then much of Henry's intercourse, after he grew up, with both father and stepmother, had entailed efforts of another description, and to a youth so schooled in the family, society presented no great diffi culties. But he had naturally a good deal of iiplomb, and very little vanity. He meant to be a good soldier, and he meant to command his regiment some day, and on another, a very distant day, to be the third Earl"], [23, "BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING. 11 of Kendal, and to take his seat in the House of Lords, the representation of his county being shut, as well he knew, to his father's son for ever.

Nine times out of ten it is over the Bridge of Sighs that we pass the narrow gulf from youth to manhood. \u2014 Lord Lytton. Death, which solves all riddles for the man whom it overtakes, is very often apt to leave, however, a new set of them for the solution of the survivors, and when death at last cut short the career of the Honourable John St. John, it was found that he had left his brother and his eldest son joint-executors and joint-guardians to his two younger children. A family council was held at Hurst Royal upon this matter, and the deliberations there were both perplexing and perplexed. John St. John's home had been fixed for the last two years at Brighton. His daughter Annie w-as twelve years of age, his son Philip was eleven, and their mother, who was in indifferent health, had found at Brighton a society eminently to her mind. Perhaps"], [25, "13 OF FAMILY MATTERS. mind is a strong word to apply to the mental or psychical processes of Albania St. John, so I will rather substitute for it that of tastes, and say that her tastes lay in preachers, milliners, doctors, and toadies. The toadies she preferred to everything else, and she valued the clergymen, doctors, and milliners exactly in the ratio in which they might add toadyism to their other virtues and qualifications. In London, an Honourable, more or less, before one's name counts for nothing, but in Brighton it matters a great deal, and so when Mrs. St. John was left a widow, she proposed to herself to make her home by those shallow waters, and on that glaring promenade. After the funeral, Lord Kendal brought himself to see his sister-in-law for the first time. It was about seven weeks after the solemnity that he took his courage in his two hands, and, in company wdth his nephew, he went down to Brighton, where Mrs. St. John was inexpressibly comic in her preparations for his advent. She had an instinctive awe of the peer who w-as the head of the house, and who had kept her worthy husband at a distance ever since she had the benefit of his acquaintance, but she had also an instinctive pre ference for male society, so she armed herself for this meeting with a battery of charms, and then played them off on her deceased husband's brother with the greatest"], [26, "14 VERA vivacity. The best of it was that Lord Kendal, being a man of a very dry humour, entered immensely into the joke. He saw through all the smiles and tears, but he admired her blue eyes, her almond-shaped nails, her long cap-strings, and her still very pretty figure, with all the alacrity that was expected of him. Henry St. John winced the while under the spectacle, and congratulated himself that the peer did not see much of his stepmother, since the first evening had been passed in a mingled parade of sorrow and elegance that was very trying. On the second, Mrs. St. John's conversation became more confidential and secular, though she selected as a topic, less the many and varied experiences of her married life, than her triumphs as a young lady. Lord Kendal again listened with an air of conviction, and wore a face of amused commiseration over the early and violent deaths of several of her victims, smiling at times with the most grimly assenting smiles. From these subjects she passed on to that of climate. \" No one could believe how much one climate affected her spirits, or how much another tried her nerves.\" Of the climate of Brighton she had nothing but good to say, \" though it was true that her poor dear husband had \" (as the French express it) \" permitted himself to die of it.\" \" You ought to be very grateful to it, madam,\" observed Lord Kendal, makino her a grave bow, and she, not perceiving the satire in"], [27, "OF FAMILY MATTERS. 15 the speech, said that she really was so, and that she hoped to remain where she was. His lordship then, with a dry preliminary hem ! plunged into the subject of house-rent, and then disclosed to her, rather abruptly, the results of his meditations, and of a committee of ways and means held that morning with Henry St. John and their lawyer. He began by offering a very handsome subsidy for her own wants, and by promising a still better allowance for the education of his brother's children, irrespective of the allowance which he habitu ally made to Captain St. John,. Then came the question of establishments. It seemed that two could hardly be kept up, even on the means he was inclined to place at their disposal, so the house in Brighton must be let \u2014 perhaps, ultimately sold \u2014 and the w7hole party must agree to keep house together in London, and Philip must be sent to school. Mrs. St. John's dismay when she heard of this plan was not less genuine than had been that of her stepson when it was first disclosed to him. And yet twelve hours of reflection, while they showed him that its details in practice would be even more unpleasant than was its aspect in theory, had also shown him that it was the only just and feasible arrangement. Mrs. St. John had not been left any share in the guardianship of her two children, one of the two guardians must, therefore,"], [28, "16 VERA, undertake that duty, and turn to some profitable account the money allowed by Lord Kendal for their education. They must all keep house together \u2014 there was no help for it. Annie was a nice child, and Philip might not have been less so, had not his mother done her best to spoil what she now called \" the last pledge of her dear husband's affection.\" He was now to go to school, Lord Kendal said, and though Mrs. St. John consented, she was not very likely, if left to herself, to carry the terrible threat into execution. To London they were to go, Lord Kendal also said, and to London, accord ingly, they went ; and then Philip really was sent to Marlborough, and a daily governess and masters were got for his sister. Their home was a house in the upper end of Cadogan Place. There Henry St. John had his two rooms, and there, at the age of seven -and-twenty, he established himself, father of a fine family, as he said, besides being adviser, tutor, and major-domo to Mrs. St. John. I know that she disliked the change, and I do not think that she liked her stepson. For some weeks she had held forth to all her acquaintances in Brio-hton about these plans ; how Lord Kendal had proposed this, and Lord Kendal had arranged that, and so on \u2022 with \" Lord Kendal \" at every second word, and ad"], [29, "17 CF FAMILY MATTERS. nauseam. That had been very fine in its w'ay, but the reality had by no means proved as delectable, and Henry St. John, on close acquaintance, turned out to be most aggravatingly like his uncle ; not like the Lord Kendal whom she was apt to harangue about, but like the one who did his duty, and expected other people to do theirs ; who gave pounds unasked for, and demanded a strict account of pence, who preferred deeds to words, who had a dry way of instantly clearing the argument of all sophisms, paradoxes, and cobwebs, and of expect ing the plainest of \" becauscs \" to follow on the shortest of \" whys 1 \" Annie St. John loved her half-brother, and she was, perhaps, the only person in the house who did. She was not afraid of him, she perched on the arm of his chair, played tidy little tunes to him of an evening, made his breakfast, smoothed out his newspapers, and reduced the rooms to something like order, for his comfort. Annie was not pretty, but she was lively and truthful, and Mrs. St. John felt her to be rather on the enemy's side whenever, by some gross unpunctuality in appointments or payments, she was made uneasy under her stepson's eyes. Really she tried his patience. Her obstinate coldness when they were alone, her smooth spokenness when strangers were present, her foolish flutters in men's society, her equally foolish terrors in the 2"], [30, "18 VERA, streets, her untidiness and extravagance, her perpetual wrangles with her servants, her whims about her health and victuals, her palpable neglect of her daughter \u2014 all these were features which might well have worn out the patience of an older or wiser man. But Henry St. John was, as he briefly expressed it, \" in for the thing,\" and he would stick to it, keeping his temper in the best way he could, and removing his little sister as far as he could from the effects of her mother's folly. He walked with her often, and read for her ; and then Lord Kendal gave her horses, and they rode together, and as Annie gradually shot up into a tall, graceful girl, her love and gratitude made the home life less trying. At thirty-two years of age Captain, now Colonel, St. John, was quite a family man. People admired him, and the London mammas who had long wondered why he did not marry, settled that he would not do so now until he had seen his sister established. Seven or eight years ago Henry St. John had, as it happened, wished to marry, and his choice had then fallen on a girl in his own county. But there the legends of his father's misconduct had pursued him. Lord Kendal had disapproved of the match, the young lady's family had been less than cordial, and finally the fair one had been false, so that the affair had ended in disappointment and pain. He did not easily get over"], [31, "OF FAMILY MATTERS. 19 it. He was incapable of replacing the fickle idol, or of beginning again at London routs and balls all the preludes and proems of the tender passion, and before long the death of his father had thrown on his shoulders a new burden of cares. And it is the way of this wicked world that as one trouble vanishes another comes. Henry St. John going into society in 1853-4, with his sister, was a quite heart-whole man, and Annie's social prospects were good, but then here was Philip grown up, and already on his \" way through the world,\" if one might judge by the way that he made through his allowance. Lord Kendal had again been paymaster in this case, and had bought a commission for the youngster in the Grenadier Guards, when, wonderful to relate, he had got through his examination. He was now launched in London life, beautiful in his own eyes, and in those of Mrs. St. John. He resembled his mother. He had her fair hair, and good blue eyes, and withal such a pretty pink and white complexion, that he would have made in that respect a prettier young lady than did poor Annie, who had inherited the olive cheek of the late honourable John. The good looks were spoilt, however, by a rather peevish expression, and by an extreme of self-consciousness that would have been fatal to Nar-"], [32, "20 VERA. cissus. And a more extravagant boy never lived. The grief of his life \u2014 its secret grief surely, for one cannot fancy even Mrs. St. John silly enough to have been its confidante \u2014 was that he was number two in the family, and that no amount of wishing would make him heir to an earldom, or make sure that through life \"the pigeons would fly \" (as the Germans say) \"ready roast into his mouth.\" That was certain ; but he seemed less convinced of the truth of what might be called its minor proposition, viz. that he ought not to buy what he could not pay for, or bet sovereigns when he had but sixpences to spend. Philip had already made many attempts to solve the problem of cutting the coat wider than the cloth, and one of the most remarkable of these experiments had been made at Marlborough College when a boy of fourteen. He bought a pony. Where he got it, or what he paid for it, is not known to history ; but an approximation can be made as to what it \" stood him in,\" from the. fact that he had an allowance of two shillings a week of pocket-money. Part of this sum he devoted to the pony's keep, and to the hire of the shed in which the animal was hidden. Whether a prolonged diet of squibs and toffy disagreed with it there, or whether, as is but too probable, its master forgot to feed it, I cannot say, but one day the poor starved brute, with ribs protruding, with knees tottering, and"], [33, "21 OF FAMILY MATTERS. with a coat two inches long, was produced before the angry eyes of Dr. Colenso, who ordered the pony to be shot, and the boy to be flogged. This had unfortunately not been Philip's last adven ture in horseflesh, and so it happened that on the eve of his departure for the Crimea, the sum of 7801. w7as wanted to pay his lawful debts. The debts had formed the subject of that conversa tion between the two brothers which is mentioned on the first page of this book. The money was to be forth coming, the elder brother said, the people who advanced it being Colonel St. John, and Colonel Alfred Newbold, a brother officer of his own, who knew something of the family affairs, and who had just claimed for himself a right to know them. He had just engaged himself to Annie St. John, and had given her the assurance of his love before taking a long and enforced leave of her, and of his country."], [34, "22 VERA, CHAPTER III.

Now as I recall those February days, all their fare wells, all the steps that then left thresholds they were never again to cross, all the ashy faces, and all the unspeakable pangs of parting suffered that month through the length and breadth of Britain, my eyes, even at this distance of years, grow dim ; the pain of it all seems too fresh : so that I can hardly dwell on it.

His mother, prostrate on her face in her chamber, and praying to God through all that grey and cheerless dawning, was not the less to be pitied, or the less a mother, because she happened to be also an unutterably foolish woman. Her darling was gone from her : when and how would he return ? For Annie the worst was yet to come, for in that embarkation of the household troops the Grenadiers had had the pas. At 6 a.m. their train had moved out of the Waterloo Bridge station, and before the brief February day had closed, the three great steamers had received their precious freights, and then in order (first the Manilla, then the Ripon, and, two hours later, the Orinoco) they stood out into the Southampton Water, and with the next morning's tide they were gone. But the Scots Fusilier Guards were still in London, and to remain till the following Tuesday. Their last week was full of business and bustle. An inspection at the Wellington Barracks, w-kere a princely mother and sister came to see a princely soldier under arms, and a dinner given to the same Prince by the members of White's, where the chairman also was a prince in lineage, and in personal beauty, if not absolutely one by title \u2014"], [36, "24 VERA. these, and many other engagements, filled up Colonel St. John and Colonel Newbold's last days in London. \" Apply to Lord Kendal in your first difficulty, and do not wait for a second.

What her lover's were she might not choose that I should repeat, or that you should hear ; but they were said on the stairs, and after those words the two men were gone. It was 11 p.m., and when the girl ran up to her room, she saw by the lamplight that a shower of snow was falling, and had already covered with a white sheet the steps and the threshold where their feet had last stood. Was this a good augury or a bad ? My readers may remember something of the pro gramme of the 27th of February, when the Queen, sur rounded by her children, saw the Scots Fusilier Guards drawn up before the great entrance of Buckingham Palace. All of Westminster that was not already awake and a-foot at that hour, must have been startled by the volleys of cheers with which she was greeted and which she was content on that day to share with her cousin, as also by the loud braying of the band, and by the huzzas of the populace, as the regiment made its way through the Mall, and by Trafalgar Square, to the \u2022Strand and the Bridge.

In the garden-court of an old house in the Tverskoi Street in Moscow, a boy and a girl had been standing together for some time on an evening of the early summer of 1854. Dinner was over, and a reunion that was to take place that evening in Prince and Princess Michael Zamiatine's room had not yet begun. The girl was their only child, Princess Vera ; the youth was their godson, cousin, and ward, the young Count Alexis Dimitri vitch Zotoff. They were occupied with each other and with a large brass field-piece, which, with its"], [39, "27 OF OUR MOTHER MOSCOW. green painted carriage and caissons, occupied the centre of the terrace, and the servants, whose heads appeared from time to time at doors and windows, were occupied with the gun and with the young couple ; and they, at least, deserved attention. Vera Zamiatine, dressed in white, stood holding together with one hand a mass of fleecy-looking, white Archangel knitting, which her com panion had thrown over her as they came out, and with the other she stroked occasionally the shining brass tube of the big gun against which her companion leant. She was sixteen years of age, tall and blonde, very slender and delicate, reminding one of those exotics that require a temperature all moisture, warmth, and light, to make their white and waxen petals expand, and give forth all their beauty, and all their scent. Alexis was more than three years her senior, and in love with her, and it was quite possible that a couple of years hence a union between them might be an arrange ment as probable as it w-as pleasant for their families even now to contemplate. They were only distantly related to each other, but the boy and girl had been intimate since childhood. Count Alexis, when he left the Corps des Pages, had hesitated before adopting any career, but this war had decided his choice. He had assisted actively in the levying of the militia. Now the war was going to carry away the young volunteer, and,"], [40, "28 VERA. as the regiment was to leave Moscow on the morrow, he had come to-night to bid his fair cousin farewell. Everything about them spoke of war. At dinner the conversation had been military, and with old soldiers, as well as with new, the favourite topics had been alternately the field-piece newly presented by Prince Michael Zamiatine to his country, and that regiment of volunteers raised in the government of Moscow, in which Alexis had a commission, which had been partly recruited on his estates, and which to morrow, after receiving the blessing of the Metropolitan, was to leave for Odessa.

She had been anxious about her daughter, and saw with gratitude that Vera was by no means broken-hearted over the immediate departure of the young Count Alexis. This Vera was far too precious an only child to be allowed to pine for any one, be the hero who it might. As yet, however, everything was well, and these raptures of Vera's during the last ten weeks about banners, regiments, prayers, and heroes, came only from an innocent and patriotic excitement. Anna Feodorovna, the mother of my heroine, was of semi-Swedish extraction : a fair-haired, and very delicate woman, to whom, in spite of her truly northern birth, life in a northern climate had been one long martyrdom, and she was now at thirty-seven years of age a cripple from rheumatic gout, seldom leaving the sofa except to be carried out of her salon to more suffering and to bed.

Alexis, you are to tell her what you said just now about the silver trumpets.\" Alexis, who looked pleased, drew his chair nearer to that of Countess Zotoff, and said something soothing to her. The poor lady had tears in her eyes. \" I know there are dangers here as well as there \u2014 in peace as well as in war \u2014 and God, who protected my lamented husband, Dimitri Grigorovitch, on his journey to Jerusalem, can bring me back my son.

With the earliest dawn of that to-morrow all Moscow was on foot. It was as if a great fair was about to be held, and never, whether to eyes about to enter the town for curious pleasure only, or to eyes about to bid it fare well for ever, had the mother-city, with her high belfries and her \" pearl-like thousand crowns,\" seemed more beautiful or more proud. But pride, pleasure, and duty all have their price, and a heavy one was to be paid to day, both by poor wives and mothers of soldiers, who were not above showing their despair at the departure of the regiment, and by high-bred women like the Countess Zotoff, who if she wept shed her tears alone. After a very early breakfast, Alexis' farewells were said. \" Oh, my Alexis ! my only son, my widow's mite, my all ! \u2014 oh,"], [50, "38 VERA, my soul!\" the mother cried, and Vera too wrung his hands, and blushed as he pressed hers again and again to his lips. \" Come back soon,\" she cried, and waved her handkerchief after he left the house. And then the carriages were ordered round to take the whole party to the parade-ground, where the regiment was to be in spected, where a mass was to be said, and where the Metropolitan would give his blessing to the men. The Zamiatines were in an open britska, but the mother of Alexis preferred to follow alone in a small close carriage. A low mass \u2014 that of the Presanctified Elements \u2014 having been celebrated in a tent on the ground, and the 20th, and 21st, Psalms repeated, a grand Te Deum was sung, and then in the most unbroken and curious stillness, Philarete, the Archbishop of Moscow and Kalomna, raised himself before the troops. Confronting this new legion of the Czar he stood, a small, ethereal-looking being, whose robes of golden tissue could not conceal the diminutiveness of his stature, any more than did his long flowing hair and beard take from his head an air of resolute personal courao-e. His smile was exquisite, and in the middle of his pale, passionless face shone pale blue eyes of extraordinary beauty and extraordinary fire. The eyes were actually"], [51, "\" GO WHERE GLORY WAITS THEE ! \" 39 small, but when open they seemed to have an intensity of vision, the face appeared then to be all sight, just as the frail, puny body was all sensibility and all soul.

In spite of a low and almost weak voice, he had the repu tation cf no ordinary rhetorical talent. He was greatly beloved, therefore, whenever he gave his benediction, the populace ever came together in crowds, and to-day this great concourse of the people, civil as well as military, as assembled on the Champs de Mars, waited breathlessly for him to speak. He first delivered to the safe keeping of the regiment the picture of its patron, a Saint Sergius, covered with gold plates, and set in a massive gold and jewelled frame. He then said \u2014 \" Children of the Czar our father, and of Russia our mother, brothers of the army, the Czar, the country, and Christianity call upon you. The prayers of the church, and of the country accompany you. Holy Russia is again provoked by the enemy she vanquished before under Catharine II. and Alexander I.

His holy image was carried with our regiments under the Czars Alexis, Peter I., and Alexander I., in their great battles against the twenty nations. Let the image of the venerable Sergius go with you, as a pledge of the pressing and efficacious prayers which he ever addresses to God for you. Carry with you also the warlike and victorious speech of the Czar-Prophet David, how he said, ' Salvation and glory are of God.' \" When the Metropolitan had given the benediction to the prostrate mass of human beings before him, the drums began to roll, and as the troops defiled off the parade-ground, to the superb strains of \" How glorious"], [53, "\" GO WHERE GLORY WAITS THEE ! \" 41 is our Lord in Sion,\"* they were followed slowly, but closely, by the carriages. On reaching the Red Gates of the city a halt was sounded, and the crowd entering the portal was stopped by an if possible greater crowd coming out to meet it. In front were the Merchant] Companies of Moscow, headed by their Provost, who brought out bread and salt, welcoming the soldiers in oriental guise, while, in a still more emphatically oriental manner, the common people fell at their feet, thanking the soldiers for going out in the cause of the country, and embracing their knees, as they now wept over their hands, and now kissed with fervour that \" Zemlia Moskovshtja, zemlia Rouskaja\" (Earth of Moscow, Soil of Russia), for which, but for these poor militiamen, it might have been their own turn to bleed. At length, when eyes had looked their last, the regiment was gone. Alexis, the young centurion,! had disappeared from Moscow, and to the pangs of separa tion was added the dreariness of reaction. Vera suffered least of all. She was so young, so hopeful, that visions of victory \u2014 victory for Russia, for her holy religion, and for her cousin \u2014 still filled her dreams. Out in the garden she, too, knelt and kissed the sod: \"Zemlia * An air we are now very familiar with in England, and generally sung with the words of the hymn, \" Thine earthly Sabbaths.\" f Sotnik, captain of a hundred."], [54, "42 VERA.

Prince Michael Zamiatine was however no stranger to them. The headstrong will of the great Czar, and the equally imperious temper of one of his Ministers, had brought Russia at last into a collision with the great Western powers, an event for which it wras the fashion in St. Petersburg to say that she was so amply prepared, that there could be no doubt of her splendid success. But to practical men that success was a more problematical affair. Though the Czar reigned over an eighth part of the globe \u2014 from the Polar snows to the sunburnt rocks of Yalta and Aluptka \u2014 and though he was master of more than sixty millions of men, his subjects were of varied races, and it was to be feared that Russia might prove a tree whose branches were only tied to it, and not a trunk sending forth strong arms full of sap and vigour. On paper the Russian army was magnificent, yet the seat of war was distant. The theatre of war was ex tensive, and it might become (as it did) still further"], [55, "\" GO WHERE GLORY WAITS THEE ! \" 43 extended. In the great war of Catharine II. against Sweden, Russia had once before been so depleted of men that the very frotteurs of the Empress' palaces had been enlisted, and she had seen herself left without guards at Tzarkoe-Selo. Such times might come again. However, in the meantime, as it had pleased the Czar to go to war, Prince Michael Zamiatine was fain to give what help he could both to the finances and to the military strength of his master. He robbed his treasure-chamber of some hundred poods of plate, he cut down a forest, and he sold the timber to the Jews, and with the proceeds he equipped half a hundred men raised on his estate, and he also presented a fine field-piece to the country and the regiment. Now the troops were gone, and a season of retrenchment and privacy was before him and his family, to be rewarded, as he believed, in the future, by the success of the Russian arms, and, as he also hoped, by the smiles of the Czar. It was long since those smiles had fallen on Michael Zamiatine ; so long, that, weary of missing them, and still more weary of waiting for them, he had abandoned St. Petersburg, where he had once been a favourite courtier, and had buried himself in Moscow, except at such times as his wife's bad health compelled him to travel. And to Prince Michael's credit as a husband, be it said, that he had never betrayed by sign or token any"], [56, "44 VERA, sense of annoyance to his wife, though Anna Feodorovna had been undoubtedly the cause of his disgrace at court. She was allowed to remain ignorant of the fact\u2014 ignorant that their frequent absences from Russia, and her own extreme intimacy with Madame Swetchine, as well as her leaning (derived from Madame Swetchine) towards the Church of Rome, had all offended the patriotism and the orthodoxy of Nicholas. \" L'itat c'est moi ! \" is an autocratic enough sentiment, but Nicholas went far beyond this. He was ready, with Medea, to say, \" My self suffices,\" and to contend that his court, his climate, his faith, his manners, and his customs must, could, and should suffice to any well-disposed Russian. Anna Feodorovna had lived much abroad \u2014 ergo, she was dis contented at home ; Anna Feodorovna corresponded with Jesuits, and with the leaders of the Dominican revival, \u2014 ergo, she might have unsound views on the Polish and other questions ; she wyas lukewarm, and, therefore, she was ungrateful. Towards her husband the Czar's friendship, from all these causes, gradually cooled. First one request was denied, and then another ; permission to travel was sometimes rudely granted, and sometimes rudely refused, and still the Prince hoped on, waiting for the cloud to be dispelled from the Imperial brows, of which he did not even know the cause. At last, when, one day, his name was mentioned to the Czar, and the"], [57, "\" GO WHERE GLORY WAITS THEE ! \" 45 Czar had replied with a Jove-like frown, that \" Michail Vassilievitch was unfortunate in his marriage,\" then he saw that the case was a hopeless one, and leaving the capital, he withdrew, as I have said, to Moscow, and to the old seat of his race, where he brought up its sole scion and representative, his only daughter, Princess Vera. She was a beautiful and delicate girl, full of patriotic enthusiasm, and speaking her native language with a purity and proficiency which, thirty years before, had been very uncommon among the women of her class ; grace ful, and full of promise as she was, her father also saw with pleasure that her own sympathies would probably lead her to make a Russian marriage, and to adopt more national ideas than had ever inspired his wife. In this way he would not even be tempted to sacrifice his child to his loyalty, or to his ambition \u2014 for I do not know by which name a Russian noble, who is great already by birth, and by the possession of broad lands, calls his devotion to the sovereign who is at once the fountain of honour and of preferment. Should the young Count Zotoff, who had just left them, reap laurels in this war, he would prove all the more suitable a match for the young enthusiast, and thus it was from many motives, and for many reasons that the father of Princess Vera opened his house that summer to Countess Zotoff, while he said, with all his heart,"], [58, "46 VERA. \" God speed the regiment of Moscow militia, especially the hundred of Kalomna, and its centurion, Alexei Dimitrivitch, whom the saints have ever in their keeping.\""], [59, "47 CHAPTER VI.

When the news of the intended invasion of the Crimea reached him he seemed to be breathlessly anxious to proceed to the seat of war, and his mother smiled and trembled alternately at each of the paragraphs in her boy's letters. At length, when the landing at Eupatoria had been effected by the Allies, his spirits did not seem to suffer from an event which only added fuel to the fire of his patriotism.

When the battle of the Alma had proved all such fair promises delusive, it became impossible to make the reserves believe that a victory had been gained where a defeat had really been sustained, but it was easy on the other hand to make them feel that the time had come when their services would be required, and the prospect of immediate action soon cheered the young cen turion.

As battalion followed battalion, a pro digious mass of infantry now covered the whole line of route, and the Moscow militia among the rest, as they made their apprenticeship in war, were no strangers to either hunger, weariness, or disease. They had to become acquainted then with woeful sights of deserted homesteads, and of dying comrades, and with dreary sounds also of moaning men, and of straining beasts of burden ; in short, they were strangers to nothing except to fear or to discontent. Every available means of convey ance was seized upon by the authorities \u2014 Tartar arabas, mules, waggons, and carriages of every description \u2014 so that those whom weakness or disease made unable to march might be able to keep up, for a time, at least, with the head-quarters of their corps, but when all these resources failed, too many were left behind, and men and animals alike perished in the weary way, from exhaustion, exposure, and want.

But well might Grand Duke Michael, that martinet of the parade-ground, say of war, that \"he hated it, because it ruined the uniforms,\" for drenched with autumnal rains, and splashed with autumnal mire, were all the reinforcments which arrived. By every route they came, and of \" food for powder \" there was now a goodly supply both within the fortifications and without. General Pauloff's divisions were quartered on the north side, but So'imonoff 's troops, including the Tenth, and part of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Divisions, entered the town, to be welcomed by the besieged, and by the two young Grand Dukes, Michael and Nicholas, whose presence lent a certain air of gala to their reception. Alexis saw with satisfaction that his own travel-stained appearance was quite as generally acceptable, if not more so, than the spick and span daintiness of some young Petersburgeois newly arrived, like himself, at the seat of war, and less prepared than he had been, by a march of about three hundred miles, for what they might next have to encounter.

No casualties occurred that night, but on the next he was made to see war in earnest, for first one gunner and then another was killed near him in the same battery ; and this night \u2014 that of the 4th November \u2014 only preluded a day of incessant preparation and toil. The Russian commanders determined at this stage to put a stop to the siege, and invigorated rather than depressed by the affair of the 26th of October, now intended to pour a fresh army on the advanced lines of the Allies, and to make this attack decisive, they hoped to give it all the features of a surprise.

A drenching rain continued to fall as it had done all day, a great number of soldiers were at work, or on guard in the English trenches, and the fire from the batteries, never very heavy on that day, slackened so much as night approached, that in the camp of the Second Division a sharp ear might have detected at times some rumbling noises in the valley beneath, caused, as it was said, by the rolling and creaking of the Tartars' arabas, which in constant strings, with labourino bullocks, and with groaning axles, dragged up by ni<dit and by day, through mud and through mire, Sebasto pol's apparently endless supplies."], [65, "INKERMANN. 53 Colonel St. John, like all his neighbours of the First Division, would never have dreamt of ascribing these sounds (supposing him to have heard them), to any new or alarming cause.

These com pliments of the season to a poor man out in the Crimea might really have been omitted, I think; however, as she says she has paid them it's all right : only it is a deplorable way of spending good money,\" added the young gentleman, philosophically, as he made some futile advances to Bob, the dog belonging to the Scots Fusiliers. \" What a cunning brute it is ! \" he exclaimed, as the terrier contrived as usual to give him the slip (Bob would not allow himself to be touched by an officer), and then Philip stuffed his letters into his pockets, lit another cigar, and finally took himself off to his own tent, splashing, and grumbling as he went. Soon after, Colonel St. John lay down, but he and the brother officer who shared his little dog-kennel tent, did not find their domicile peculiarly watertight on this occasion, and they slept but little, even though in the course of another hour a more than ordinary stillness prevailed. Yet this, had they but known it, was the very night of the \"thief.\" While yet the wheels of the Russian guns fell noise lessly on the moist and yielding earth, at 2.30 a.m., Pauloff's divisions began their march, and they reached the bridge over the Tchernaya, and the ravines which led"], [67, "55 INKERMANN. up to the English right, before an alarm of any kind was raised. With him came many guns, and 13,500 bayonets. At four a.m. the great bells of Sebastopol began to ring, and then the other half of the force which was to fall upon the sleeping besiegers, mustered to arms. The churches were filled, and thither repaired many of the commanding officers, though the soldiers them- selves did not (as the popular English reports averred) attend the solemn mass intended to call down upon the armies of the Czar the blessing of a too partial Heaven. So far at least the skies were propitious to them, and a misty darkness reigned as Soimonoff's columns issued from the town. Of these some were tried and some were untried soldiers : all looked for victory, some hoped for revenge : all were silent, obedient, and strong. Their path lay to the left of the Malakoff Hill, and it was by the western side of the Kilene Balka that they were intended to throw them selves on the English left, while Pauloff's forces fell on our right, and while far to the westward a feigned attack by the Russians was to prevent any co-operation on the part of the French.

It was now about 5 a.m., and as General Codrington rode along the outposts, the English lines were all dark and silent, as in the night. The sentries an swered \" All's well \" to his challenge, and the officer rode on. Suddenly a rattle of musketry smote on his ear. It came, as he found, from a neighbouring coppice, where a picket, on the left of the Light Division, had just been surprised. In what force the Russians might be present there was not light enough to show, but danger there was to some extent, greater or smaller, and Codrington galloped back to turn out the camp, and in another moment our bugles had sounded the alarm. In truth the great enterprise now touched the"], [69, "THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER. 57 moment of its accomplishment, and a vast cloud of skirmishers covered the columns which were fast con- verging for our destruction. But soldiers, like shepherds, may be wearied out by the cry of \" Wolf! \" and tbus it happened\" that, when the bugles rang out along the lines at this matutinal hour of Sunday, the Fifth of November, Colonel St. John, like most of the officers of the brigade, concluded in his own mind that the cause was probably but a trifling one, and nothing more than one of those alarms with which, on many previous nights and mornings, the Russians had tried their tempers, and disturbed their rest. He had even some difficulty in rousing his companion, and it wTas nearly six o'clock before the regiment was fairly under arms. The day was then faintly lightening in the east, but a close, fine rain continued to fall, making the ground more wet, the air more dark, and the contour of all objects more uncertain. The Grenadiers were already on the ground, and beginning to lead, so the order to form into column, and to support them was no sooner given than it was executed by the Scots Fusiliers, who tben in this order began their march out of camp, across some distance of slightly undulating ground, covered with brushwood, or with a stiff coppice, consisting of dwarf oaks and acacias."], [70, "58 VERA Still, a great uncertainty prevailed as to whether anything more than an \"alert\" was being practised upon them by the Russians, and when advancing, the nature of the ground was such as to cause the Fusiliers to fall into some little disorder ; but it was only the disorder of a moment, for already the Russian guns on the further (the Inkermann) side of the valley had come into play, and their red blazing shells, as they came plunging through the morning mist, rending its grey veil for an instant, and then falling, to burst, perhaps, in the coppice, convinced the officers that a serious engage ment was intended, or rather had already begun. The sight of a riderless horse, which, terribly mangled, rushed past just then in a maddened gallop, added still more to this conviction ; and the men were ordered to lie down, while their Colonel rode on to reconnoitre. The day had dawned. In that pale mist, com panies might well have been taken for battalions, and regiments for brigades, yet, such as it was, the daylight now sufficed to show the figures of the Duke of Cam bridge, of the Brigadier, and of their staff, with the Grenadiers formed up on the right, and two columns of Russian infantry slowly ascending the hill in front of the Sandbag Battery. The psalmody, and the curses of theological import in which General Soimonoff's soldiers had indulged"], [71, "59 THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER. when they issued from Sebastopol, were now hushed. Not a whisper, not a cough, not a sigh broke from their ranks, as in the most deathlike silence they breasted the hill, and their two dark masses looked like two great patches of a darker grey, on the face of that grey and mist-covered slope. A few breathless moments more, and the two armies must close ; and breathless indeed were those moments to the Guards, for (in order to make himself heard, and to enforce an order to the Grenadiers to change their position), the Duke of Cambridge might be seen during them, riding with his staff between the fire of friends and foes, utterly regardless of personal risk. At last, when one wing of that regiment had wheeled, the two armies found themselves face to face. A more than dropping fire had been going on for some time, but now the Fusiliers poured their first rattling volley into the always advancing foe. The advantage of the ground was with the English, and when this fire was followed by a charge with the bayonet, the columns opposed to them wavered, and then retired (but in order), the rear ranks firing as they went. A second time the Russians, in more formidable numbers, pressed up the hill. A second time the Guards met them with a deadly, telling fire, and followed it with the bayonet : again the Russian"], [72, "60 VERA, columns gave way ; but this time not in order : and then for the third time they reformed, and steadily advanced to the attack. The Fusiliers had got their blood up ; at least it was rising, and this threatened to hurry their aim. \" Steady, lads ! steady, there ! take a good aim ! '' cried Colonel St. John to his company, and then their murderous volley flew. \" Steady ! \" he shouted again, and as he spoke he raised his right hand as if to curb their impatience. He had good cause through life to remember that instant and its gesture, for it probably pointed him out as a mark to a Russian sharpshooter, and while the words were still on his lips, his other arm was shattered by a shot just above the elbow, and it fell powerless by his side. For a moment the shock was paralysing, and then the blood began to trickle down his sleeve upon the blue cloak he wore. Yet it was not a moment to think of pain. \" Had you not better go to the rear, sir ? \" asked his sergeant. \"No, it is only the left arm,\" was the reply, and after drawing, Colonel St. John again waved his right one, cried \" Come on ! \" and led the third repulse. The Russians turned, and the Fusiliers would fain have pursued them down the hill, had not a staff officer"], [73, "THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER. 61 ridden up at that moment with an order forbidding them to pass beyond its brow. Such caution was required, for in truth the position of the Guards was now an anxious one. Pauloff's and Soimonoff's columns in coming from different directions had managed to converge far more closely than had been intended, and though it is true that by mistaking in the darkness one side of the ravine for the other, their divisions were, when they met, hampered from want of room, not the less were then dense and overpowering masses dangerous to the Guards, upon whom their weight, and indeed the whole brunt of the battle, must fall. The Sandbag, the one small battery in which the Brigade might have defended themselves, had neither guns nor banquette, and the Russian guns, so industri ously dragged into position on the previous day, had now come into play. Not only did they render it difficult to bring up reinforcements to the hard-pressed regiments, but they also rendered the passage to the rear a matter of the greatest danger to the wounded. Yet to the rear Colonel St. John must now make up his mind to retire, for pain and loss of blood were making his knees to tremble, and his head to swim."], [74, "62 VERA. CHAPTER VIII. BETWEEN THE DEAD AND THE DYING. Piu non si desta Di qua dal suon dell' angelica tromba. Inferno : Canto n. Staggering he went, but stumbling bravely on, and refusing the offer of a stretcher, as with much difficulty he made his way for a little distance. The first thing that, by arresting his attention, stopped him was the body of his friend, and brother officer, Captain . It was an awful foretaste of the day's ravage in their ranks, and of its pangs, to see this man lying on his back, with his arms wide apart, while with one hand he still grasped the naked blade of a sword which was planted more than half its length in the ground. Rolled over by a shot, he was to all appearance dead, and before this spectacle Colonel St. John paused to gaze. What a contrast was here ! Nothing but the strong soldier's"], [75, "BETWEEN THE DEAD AND THE DYING. 63 instinct, still true in death, to tell of the fine young fellow who, the day before, had been the life and soul of the regiment. \" Shall I never hear that jovial voice again \u2014 never see that sunny face ? \" said the wounded man to himself; and longer he would have mourned had not a round shot striking the ground immediately in his front, awakened him from his trance of sadness, and he resumed his march to the rear, fortunate in so far that he continued to avoid the shells, whose course in long parabolic curves he was able to watch and calcu late ere they fell. This flight of projectiles from the batteries on the Inkermann hills completely commanded his track, and it was in itself a source of great danger to the falling back of a wounded man, especially if, like Colonel St. John, he was beginning to feel faint. He descried now at a little distance a disabled gun-carriage, and a broken-down ammunition-waggon, sheltered in some measure by the rather closer brushwood of the spot. Near them were some moving objects, and on walking towards these he found them to be some men of his own brigade, who were having their wounds dressed by Dr. Elkington, previous to being removed to their camp whenever the ambulances might come to their succour. Of these, many were already beyond the reach of human aid ; others were fast groaning out their dying breath, and"], [76, "64 VERA. perhaps with that last breath also some last messages to England. Henry St. John lay down among them, heedless at first of who might be his nearest companions in trouble, till, as his eyes wandered about him, he perceived at the distance of about ten yards a body which was immoveable, and which, from its blue cloak, was plainly that of an officer of the Household Brigade. Towards this he contrived to crawl, meaning to offer to the sufferer all that remained of the contents of his pocket-flask. But was this, indeed, still a sufferer ? With a groan, forced from him by the pain in his left arm, he contrived to kneel down, and to lift the cape which partially covered the head. Blood he saw oozing from a wound in the side of the neck, but the face was averted, and then Colonel St. John, shuddering with some strange intuition of pain, gave one gentle pull to the shoulder, and turned the body round so as to see it. It was that of his brother Philip, the youngest ensign of the Grenadier Guards, and the face was the face of a corpse. Mortally wounded in the first hour of the engagement round the Sandbag Battery, Philip St. John had been carried so far by some drummers, and then, when his case was seen to be hopeless, he had been laid down here under the cover of the bush. Colonel St. John sickened at the sight. The boy"], [77, "BETWEEN THE DEAD AND THE DYING. 65 was dead \u2014 never again to gladden a mother's sight, or to whisper soft nonsense into a woman's ear. Dead ! and already stiffening : with filmy eyes, and with his fair whiskers and his white throat all clotted with gore. Dead ! but dead at least by a painless death, and dead as a soldier should die. Another blue cloak he now also remarked at a little distance from where he was, but he had not strength or heart to move from the dear object at his knee, and though that object was senseless to a brother's care, he remained holding its clammy hand in his own. It was strange to feel that with the death of this lad, and with Annie's marriage, his personal task in this world had ended. He had tried to do his duty by them, and should death also overtake him on this Crimean field it would find him beside his charge and beside his dead : and if, he said to himself, a father's two sons had in their lifetime had little, too little, in common, in death, at least, they would not be divided. With such thoughts the sore wounded man continued to bend above the slain, while he heard first one shell and then another, come winging through the air, and over all nearer sounds the distant, and perplexed roar of the conflict. It was about this time that the Guards, whose am munition was exhausted, began to give way. Over powered by numbers, they had to retire, leaving the 5"], [78, "66 VERA, Sandbag Battery in the hands of the enemy, whose further possession of all the adjacent ground was only disputed by a few weak, worn, but desperately unyielding, spirits. The Russians, making the most of a present advan tage, came pressing on, no longer always now in the serried columns of the morning attack, but rather in the furious disorder of victory. Some of them even approached the spot where Colonel St. John lay, and it was their yells, as they came trampling through the brushwood, which first awakened him to a sense of a new, and real danger. These men seemed to be stragglers, for no officers were with them, and drunk with blood, they seemed to own no control. Two of the foremost he saw rush toward the other blue cloak, which lay, as I have said, a little to his right, and then with a shout of \" Och, Poganoi ! \" (ah, Pagan !) they struck their bayonets sure and home into the quivering body of that wounded officer. At their first approach, Colonel St. John had grasped his revolver, determined to defend his brother's corpse, and to await the event beside it, but at this sight his blood boiled. In an instant he fired on them, missed his aim, and again cocked his pistol. He was in the very act of firing for the second time, when a Russian officer, a fair-haired young man, leapt swiftly out of the"], [79, "BETWEEN THE DEAD AND THE DYING. 67 brushwood, crying, \" Cease, you swine ! \" and, just as he passed, he received the ball intended for the savages under his command. He flung up his arms, gave a sharp cry, and there, between Colonel St. John's feet, and the murdered officer in blue, Alexis Zotoff fell. The danger of the living but one-armed Guardsman was now at its climax. Another moment, and these dis orderly militiamen might well avenge on him their cen turion's death, and his random shots. But just now the long-looked-for reinforcement to the brigade appeared in sight, and on the approach of Sir George Cathcart's division, not only did these stragglers take to flight, but all the Russian columns then on the plateau gave way for a time, Cathcart heroically following them down the hill, to be there, as we know, outnumbered and slain. Colonel St. John, his danger passed, found himself again comparatively alone. On one side of him lay his brother's corpse, and on the other hand was the young Russian, vomiting blood, as he leant against a broken stump. \" Try to drink this, and then let me look at your wound. Yonder is one of our surgeons,\" said Henry St. John, in French, as he offered some brandy to his victim. \" Who fired that shot ? \" gasped the youth, in English as pure as the Guardsman's own."], [80, "68 VERA, \" I did. My wound makes me half blind : and as you sprang past you received the charge.\" \" Ah ! I see : you were only doing your duty however. Those unruly hounds of mine ! \" But Count Zotoff had to pause, choked by the blood which rose every moment to his lips, while the air panted through the orifice in his chest. \"Here,\" he said, showing the wound: \"and it is through the right lung, I suspect.\" \" Try to drink this,\" urged Colonel St. John. \" It would do no good,\" gasped Alexis : \" drink it rather yourself \u2014 it may save your life. Mine, I fear, is past help.\" \" Do not give up hope so soon.\" \" I cannot waste breath on hopes : death is too near, or at least seems so to me.\" \"I would it were my life, and not yours. Forgive me!\" \" Forgive you, mon ami ? Why, it might just as easily have been the other way. I would, or I might, have done the same thing\u2014 it was an accident. Both of us were at our duty.\" \" But you are too young to die.\" \" A soldier dies when his hour comes. But will you do something for me?\" \" Anything that is in my power. Any command"], [81, "BETWEEN THE DEAD AND THE DYING. 69 you may lay on me I will execute, so help me God.\" \" Take a message for me ; but first drink that brandy. No, no, I won't take it. It will save your life. You must need it, for you seem only less weak than I am. Is it only your arm that is hurt ? \" \" That is my only wound.\" \"Ah, you will do; and take these.\" And the young centurion pulled out of his pocket, and handed to the Englishman, a little bit of black bread, and a handful of iMpiros* They were rolled in a fine pocket handkerchief, and had been Alexis's sole supplies. Henry St. John felt choked at the sight of these things, given, as they were, too, with a sweet and frank smile. His victim shook his head gently, and then, pulling off his cap, he lay down as if exhausted. He appeared to be about twenty years of age, tall, and very handsome, as his fair and close-clustering curls, and his high-bred face showed now above his grey great coat. With some difficulty, he drew a small gold cross from under his uniform, and Colonel St. John noticed, as he did so, his peculiar dress \u2014 the red sash and the high black boots. \" This cross,\" he said, as he broke the little faded blue ribbon on which it hung, \" I should like to have * Cigarettes."], [82, "70 VERA, sent to Russia, to my mother, Countess Prascovia Borisovna Zotoff. Send it when you can. And this \" But the tide of blood, as it welled up to his lips interrupted him, and his voice was getting very feeble. He contrived to unpin the badge which adorned his cap \u2014 a small eight-pointed cross made of gold, and stamped with a motto \u2014 and now held this for a moment in his hand till he could find breath to speak. \" This,\" he continued at last, \"I wish to be given to my cousin and betrothed, Vera Michailovna Zamiatine. Tell her \u2014 that next to the joy and pride of being her husband, I value \u2014 that of dying ' for the Faith and the Czar.' * Will you do this for me ? \" he added with a gasping sigh. \" Trust me, trust me,\" answered Colonel St. John, as he placed his right hand in that of the dying boy. \" I do trust you. What a good face you have ! Have you a wife or a betrothed ? \" \" No, and I have no mother ; and there,\" pointing to the body on the ground, \" there is my only brother.\" \"Ah, I am very sorry for you; but \" and then, as the blood ebbed away, a faintness as of death came over * \"3a Etpy ii Uapa. Za Vtrou i Tzarja, For the Faith and the Czar.\" See the motto on the badge."], [83, "BETWEEN THE DEAD AND THE DYING. 71 Alexis. His eyes closed, and Colonel St. John thought him dead, when again the eyes opened, wide, blue, and confiding like a child's. \" Embrasscz moi \" (kiss me), he whispered in French. Colonel St. John put his lips to the fair young forehead. Alas ! it was already cold, and this was death's chill. \" Tell me your name, dear boy,\" he said : but there was no answer \u2014 only another fast-coming and fast-flying smile. The lips moved, however, and then, as Colonel St. John bent lower and lower to catch any word that they might form, a fragment of a shell caught his stooping head, and laid him senseless beside his victim. About eleven o'clock the ambulances picked him up, and carried away to the surgeon's table an unconscious, and an all but hopelessly wounded man. How, after that moment of the blow, the battle went, Colonel St. John knew not. He recked not how the Grenadier Guards had forced their way again into the Sandbag Battery, nor how when ammunition was spent, there had raged there a battle of the Gods and Titans, when, with sticks, and stones, and bayonet-thrusts, the possession of that much-contested spot was by the Household Brigade, won and lost, and lost and won. Nor did he know how, when English strength was"], [84, "72 VESA. well-nigh spent, and reserves exhausted, while fresh, and always fresh, Russian regiments kept coming to the front, a rattle of musketry and a blare of trumpets at last announced the coming of our allies \u2014 Zouaves and Chasseurs\u2014 to the rescue of England's chivalry, to tear away from Russia the prize of a five hours' hand to-hand combat. How, then, the regiment of Ochotzk flung itself on Bosquet's reinforcements, how, when the drapeau of the 6 iemo was lost, its colonel gave his life in exchange for the piece of red silk, which his men took safely home with them to France ; how the two English guns were recovered by the 55th ; how Soimonoff fell, and Dan nenberg and Pauloff at length led back their men ; how, when their great retreat at last began, it was still under a murderous fire, the English pressing on their rear with sharp bayonet charges, while the huge guns of the Vladimir and the Chersonese in the roadstead, roared their bass in the last discords of that day's din \u2014 all this let the historian tell.

Mauritius, on her way out from Balaclava, had hoped to make the pier at Scutari. She had two hundred and thirty wounded men, and three officers on board, and of these last one was Colonel Henry St. John, now deprived of his left arm, and only dimly conscious at intervals, either of that loss, or of the miseries of the crowded and uneasy transit. But worse miseries were in store for him. Instead of making good her landing, the Mauritius found herself caught in that terrible gale which not only, on the 17th, caused the loss of the Black Prince, and of innumerable transports, but also kept our wounded from Inkermann tossing up and down for more than three days and nights."], [86, "74 VERA, It was within sight of a shore she could not make, that the Mauritius here pitched and tossed; vessels they saw break from their moorings, and drift ashore ; boats and caiques were blown up into the Bosphorus : roofs of mosques and houses blew about : the very kiosk to which many of the wounded were to have been sent became a wreck: and when, at length, the hurricane abated, and quarters were finally found for him in the barrack hospital, Colonel St. John was carried ashore in the raging delirium of brain fever. Want of the necessary attendance, and all the uproar of the crowded vessel during the gale, had finished what the blow on the head had begun, and reason had for the present departed from her seat. In the hospital, among those endless corridors of moaning and miserable men, he once managed, by giving his attendants the slip, to appear. More like a spectre than a man, he came wandering through them, his aspect even there being pre-eminent in pain ; but he was caught, and, when the false strength of his feverish frenzy had burnt itself out, he was carried back to what his servant, his doctor, and his Colonel could only suppose to be a death-bed. But not so. The player does not leave the stage for ever because in one piece his fortune seems to be desperate. The tree does not perish because, in a November blast, its last sere or crimson leaf may"], [87, "75 SCUTARI. have been shed, and not till \"after many summers dies the swan ; \" and so Colonel Henry St. John recovered. I should say rather that he lived : for recovery does not accurately describe the state of a breathing skeleton taken on board a friend's frigate, and then, when able to speak, sent home to England. Mrs. St. John, who never could bring herself wholly to forgive Providence for the death of her son Philip, was, until she actually beheld him again, perhaps not sufficiently inclined to thank Providence for the preser vation of her stepson. But once she saw him her heart melted ; for, though foolish and faulty, she was a woman and a mother, and, during his weeks of helplessness in Cadogan Place, the Colonel had no reason to complain of want of care. One subject had during all this time lain, as it may be supposed, in abeyance \u2014 that of the Russian relics. Though out of sight and out of mind, the two crosses given to the Guardsman by the dying Alexis were safe, although it was not till long after his return to England that they fell under Colonel St. John's own notice. Taken from his person before the amputation of his arm in the surgeon's tent, and while he was still unconscious, they had been preserved, and they were now, along with a letter and a pocket-knife restored to him among his other"], [88, "76 VERA, small properties. So safe, then, but forgotten, they had remained since that hour among the Crimean brush wood, when he had himself lain wounded between the dying and the dead. Indeed, even these facts concern ing them were not readily remembered at first. It was days before the weakened head could catch up the long-lost train of association, and at best the recollec tion remained imperfect. These things had been given him, no doubt, by a Russian to send back to Russia ; but by whom ? and for whom '? Ah ! there was the point : and on that point memory, hazy besides on some others, was at present an absolute blank. Alas ! for the bereaved ones in Moscow.

The great poet who saw, as in a vision, the star floors of paradise, and the nether circles of hell, is not the only man who, between the ages of thirty and forty, has found himself among the shadows of a \" wild, rough, and stubborn wood.\" Nor yet is Dante the only one who, on emerging from that mental crisis, has looked back upon it almost with fear. It is felt to have been such a bitter experience that a little more of it would have been death, and"], [92, "80 VERA, than such a gloom, death itself can hardly be more painful. The cause of this suffering is ennui; and it is a mistake to suppose that only the idle or the trivial can fall a\" prey to it. For if by ennui we mean want of interest, and not only a want of present stimulus to exertion, but also that profound discouragement, and that sickliness of all the mental powers which makes us look on the past with disappointment, and on the future with dread, while the present cannot rouse us out of indifference,\u2014 if this be ennui in its worst shape, then minds of a high order have suffered from it, and, like the great Florentine, have shivered in its shadow. Only he and they have not succumbed to it. They have con fessed its horrors, but they have forced their way out of it, and struggled against the darkness, until the darkness broke. Colonel St. John made this most trying experience in the years that followed his return to England, and the breaking-up of his home after the marriage of his sister to Colonel Newbold. Annie St. John was married on just such a snowy spring day in 1855, as that on which she had seen her lover start for the East in 1854. The happy couple took a villa near Windsor, and then the home in Cadogan Place ceased to exist. Mrs. St. John was free to spend her time as she pleased, and"], [93, "81 REACTION. Colonel St. John settled into a lodging in Curzon Street, undisputed master for the future, of his person, and of his time. That empire was not long in proving a sad enough one, particularly as the one-armed soldier was still, to all intents and purposes, an invalid, and of course stoutly refused to be regarded as such. He missed all his old occupations. There was no more grouse-shooting to look forward to in Rosshire : the long salmon rod had to be laid aside for ever : there were no more billiards at Pratt's, not even any cricket at Hurst Royal, where he could only bob for perch in the lake, take Help, the mastiff, long rambling walks, or try to read in his uncle's library. But reading is an art that requires practice, and knowledge is a mistress not to be wooed in a hurry, or made a pis-aller of, and so books did not at first bring all the solace that he expected from them. Nothing could exceed Lord Kendal's tenderness, or the pleasure which he felt in his nephew's society; there fore Colonel St. John spent the greater part of the year with him, yet the silence and the uneventfulness of such a life were terrible, as terrible as every reaction must be ; for every great effort, every excitement, and every happiness, has a strange way in this world of seeming to dig its own grave. The days were long, and he was 6"], [94, "82 VERA, \"a-weary;\" weary because, though he would not own to it, the body was still sick ; because the nerves were jarred ; because neuralgia gnawed in the stump of his left arm ; because the head was too weak for study ; because he had not found the secret of the power of prayer over the darkest moods of the mind : because the spirit suffered from want of occupation, want of duties, and want of strength for a holy effort after a courageous, sustained, and patient recovery. And round one unfortunate subject his mind fretted perpetually \u2014 round the episode of the young Russian officer he had shot through the chest, and who, as he bled to death, had trusted to his enemy all his last messages for home. But let Colonel St. John rack his memory as he would, memory was silent as to the names of those two women, the young soldier's mother and his betrothed.

Many waters had been tried, and many physicians consulted, but Prince Michael could not conceal from himself that his wife's cruel complaint had gained rather than lost ground, and that Anna Feodorovna was now too great a cripple to walk from one room to the other, or even to turn over the leaves of a book for herself.

Before taking the offered hand \u2014 his only one \u2014 she ceased laughing at her own glissades, and as she glanced at his empty sleeve, she grew a shade paler, as you may see a little child do, only that, unlike a child's, her eyes expressed at the same time, such a tender and respectful pity, that Henry St. John could not but read in them an exquisite homage to his misfortune. In fact, where the girl was only in danger of losing her footing, and while her little fingers grasped his wrist tightly for one moment, the Crimean hero was in danger of losing his heart. Nay, he lost it, for in spite of the abominations of the San Giuseppe, he would have wished that line of coast receding instead of nearing, which now warned them of their near approach to the port of Rome.

To-night she was lovely. In some shining white stuff, with a rose-wreath that set off her fairness, her bare neck and arms made her look even younger than she generally did.

He went, but it was not altogether a pure gain or pleasure to him, for of course the Princess made conquests, and of course he was jealous of her admirers, especially so of those who talked to her in her own, to him, unknown tongue, and, therefore, chiefly so of a certain Prince Serge Donskoi, a young man who had many centuries of ancestors, many accomplishments, some vices, and an empty purse, and who, because he had all these, and very good taste into the bargain, paid marked attention to Prince Michael Zamiatine's only child.

The reader may probably have been asking himself whether it be possible that, during all this intercourse with a Russian family, the subject of the Russian relics from Inkermann had remained in abeyance in Colonel St. John's mind. It had very nearly done so, and that from no heart lessness on the part of the English officer, on whose mind it had lain as a weight for so long ; but as it had become to him at one time the object of an almost mono maniacal preoccupation, so it was now only natural that that feeling, like any other form of hypochondria, should fade before new and wholesome interests.

Russian \u2014 a regret rendered all the more poignant, because here, through these new friends of his, a golden opportunity had at last offered itself for trans mitting such a message to Russia, along with the long missing mementoes of a soldier's dying hour. The lesion in Colonel St. John's memory rendering this impossible, it will be understood that he hardly cared to tell his tale to the Zaniiatines, uselessly painful story as it was, and one without an end, for why should he speak of that sad accident, and sadder hour, when he had neither explanation nor expiation to offer to the boy's family ? Whenever the subject rose unbidden to his mind he generally banished it, and he only once alluded to it in a tete-a-tete with Vera's mother. How much or how little of it she might have learned from him, and how much or how little she might then have been able to assist his memory by questions as to age, appearance, or uniform of his victim, had they not been interrupted by the announcement of visitors, I know not, but apparently Anna Feodorovna had not had her attention deeply arrested by it, as she never recurred to it, and Colonel St. John naturally did not care to press it on her attention. He now waited daily for a chance of disclosing his love to Vera, and yet none such seemed to offer. Except at a ball, he never saw her alone ; she had ears and eyes"], [124, "112 VERA. in daily life for nothing but her mother's health, the announcement that in a few more days he must leave Rome had not had power to melt her, and in Princess Anna's salon, when conversation was not going on, Serge Donskoi was apt to be in possession at once of the piano and of her daughter's attention. On the day before he left Rome, the friends went together to see the view from San Pietro in Montorio, and, while the invalid remained in the carnage, Colonel St. John did suddenly find himself alone with Vera, who had walked to the edge of the terrace. \" Did I not tell you that in my capacity of guide I had kept the best sight till the last ? \" he asked her. \"It is indeed the best,\" she replied, as she bent down over the Trasteverine gardens at her feet, and then looked up and around on that amazing panorama. In the delicious atmosphere of an April day every object was clear \u2014 the distant waves that broke upon the Ostian beach, the river taking its way through the city, and, blue, and far, the wonderful outlines of the hills. \" It is the best, and now I wish that it was not the last,\" she added : \" but I thank you for bringing me here ; I shall never forget this.\" \" No ; and here comes in my selfishness, my plan and wish to be remembered along with it.\" \" Oh ! can you doubt that ? \" answered Vera, with"], [125, "IN WHICH HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF. 113 a sunny frankness that did not augur well for any response to his tender confession. \" It is the worst of having been so happy here, and of having made so many good friends, that one must leave it all, though, by the way, it is actually you, Colonel St. John, who are leaving us ; must you really go to-morrow, or is there no rimedio, as the Romans say ? \" \" None whatever, I fear ; you know England expects every man to do his duty.\" \" I pity you for having to return to England in early spring; besides, I do not like my friends to be in a country I have never seen.\" \" But some day you will see it. Will you come, and try to like it ? Would you not try to do so ? \" He dared not yet add, \" for my sake.\" \" Don't think me rude, but do you know we have travelled so much ever since I was a child, that I never think about travels, only about living at home, if we could.\" \" Could not England become a home ? \" \" Never, I fear; for, you know, it is only on mamma's account that we move about so much, and that climate would never do.

In all this pleasant good-humoured talk about their future plans, what promise was there of response to Henry St. John's passion ? History repeats itself, and Vera when Alexis took leave of her six years ago, had not been more innocent of love than she was at this moment. Colonel St. John felt that he had nothing but a friend's place in her mind, and after this conversation he settled that he had better not risk even that place by a formal proposal. The Zamiatines, perhaps, had other plans for their daughter ; \u2014 in short, the day was spent and gone, and nothing was said or done by him, and when evening came he had convinced himself that he must bid farewell to his hopes, and keep silence."], [127, "115 IN WHICH HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF. Of the group round the fountain of Trevi, V^ra was the most gay and hopeful, because she was the one most indifferent to the present parting. She knelt down and filled her hands, laughing as she wetted her pretty face in the process, and nodded to the collection of stone divinities who preside over the basin, and who looked gigantic in the gloomy shadows of the little moonlit square. She then insisted on filling a cup for her mother, and on taking it to the carriage herself. \" Drink to our coming back next winter, doushenka moja,\" she said; and Anna Feodorovna sipped out of the cup, and then lay back on her pillows, thinking rather of the \" pure immortal streams \" which rise in a more Eternal City, where men thirst no more. \" Give, 0 my God ! \" she murmured \u2014 \" give to me and to my child to drink of the Water of Life, where in Thy Supreme repose all Thy saints rest.\" Vera, meantime, had gone back to the fountain : she was alone, and Colonel St. John, had he not been already convinced of her indifference, must have been so now, for she had hardly spoken to him since they had assembled round the fountain. His eyes, on the con trary, never left her, and the last souvenir he carried awyay of Rome was that of Vera standing alone, and all in white, upon the basin's rim, and then stooping to wet her fingers, as she made the sign of the Cross on"], [128, "116 VERA, her own lips, breast, forehead, and eyes, and then walked away. To him she looked in her youth, purity, and white ness, like the Angel of the Healing Pool. Vain fool that he had been to hope to win and wear her. Which of the pilgrims at Bethesda had ever had the presumption to bid its Angel linger? The world and sick men were bettered each time that the pool was stirred by its white wings or whiter feet ; but was not the Angel always free ? In May the Zamiatines left Rome for the baths of Ischia ; but they were summoned thence in September by news from Russia. Prince Michael, so long out of favour at the court of Nicholas, had been appointed chamberlain to the wife of the Emperor Alexander, and was obliged to render himself at St. Petersburg without delay. His wife and daughter followed slowly; and St. Petersburg was reached by them at last. Nothing could exceed the satisfaction of the Prince ; but almost before the congratulations of his friends had come to an end, Anna Feodorovna took her flight from this northern Venice to a country where \"there is no more sea.\""], [129, "PART III.

Oh ! to be in England when 'tis May ! if it be but such a May as the Zamiatines found smiling over London, when Prince Michael and his daughter came to take up their quarters at Claridge's Hotel, about three weeks after the Exhibition of 1862, had been opened. Provisionally opened, let us say, when one remembers the \" chaos-come-again \" that reigned in many parts of that great brick building, of which the native"], [132, "120 VERA, hideousness was redeemed by its fine picture galleries, rather than by any happy arrangement of its very multi farious contents. Prince Michael did his duty, so he visited the Exhibition ; he always did his duty, so he took his daughter to see it, but Vera, in wandering about it, soon grew very tired. A winter at Pau had but ill succeeded in recovering her strength, for a marsh fever in the spring before had followed on the shock of her mother's death, and had left her nerveless and spiritless. They were now on their way home to their capital, taking London and the Exhibition by the way, because amusement and change had been prescribed for the Princess, and because Michael Zamiatine's mind had been fired by an account of the cannon on view there. He went again and again to examine the Armstrong guns, and all the implements of war so strangely jumbled up with all the arts of peace. Vera went to see the modern Dresden china, and then sat down again near her father, in a place where she could escape a little from the loud hammering of the work people, which still reverberated unpleasantly through many parts of the nave. She was fortunate in escaping what it once was her biographer's fate to encounter under similar circumstances, viz. a competitive trial of"], [133, "A LONDON SEASON. 121 drums in the Exposition of 1867 ; but she felt very weary, particularly of the cannons, and of the pickle trophy of immortal memory, which challenged her admiration at a little distance. Crowds of sightseers passed and repasssd her, giving that sense of loneliness which is only needed to convert bodily fatigue at any moment into bad spirits, when she was suddenly descried, and as suddenly greeted, by Colonel St. John. He was alone, and as much surprised as she could be herself at the unexpected rencontre. \" I had no idea you were in London,\" he exclaimed \u2014 and then the usual congratulations were exchanged, \u2014 and how long was it since they had met ? More than two years now. An inquiry for Princess Zamiatine's health was on Colonel St. John's lips ; but a glance at Vera's black dress, and something in her face, warned him not to speak of her mother. In the course of a ten minutes' conversation with the girl he learnt, however, from her lips the story of her bereavement, of her father's recent appointment to a post at court, of their future home in St. Petersburg, and of then- present plans for travel and change. He looked at Vera while she was speaking, and then he asked himself whether the Vera of his heart and memory had not turned out the real Vera of flesh and blood, or whether it was that the Princess herself was really changed. She was changed, and he began to feel it."], [134, "122 VERA, Altered undoubtedly, but not less winning and graceful. There was the same glittering hair, only she wore it differently, and the same lithe figure, only from her mourning dress she looked both taller and thinner ; the eyes were as large and as childlike, as blue still as violets, but they were graver, so that the colourless sweet face had got a plaintiveness about it which was quite new. When her father began to talk, he had time to watch her. How charming she was ! How trustful, and serious, and gracious her manner was ! and how attentive, even though all her attitudes were languid ! and then how pretty the voice was with which she spoke \u2014 dwelling slightly on all the vowels, and giving to French and English alike, as she pronounced them, the colour ing of her native speech ! When she smiled, her mouth had the sweetest of curves over the most pearly of teeth ; and then how patient and intelligent she was, for the appearance of a military acquaintance had unfortuuately rekindled all her father's ardour about the Armstrong guns, and the inspection of them had to be begun all over again at the beginning. During this Da Capo, Vera had to hear much of range, and charge, and vent-piece, of rifled chambers, bore, grooves, and trajectory, of siege-guns and mortars, and of certain French field-pieces \" de douzc,\" about which Prince Michael had some theories of his own \u2014"], [135, "A LONDON SEASON. 123 theories which he only required a listener to make him produce at a moment's notice. Vera knew that the exposition of these ideas was always a lengthy process, so she sat down again beside him, planting her little camp-stool among these instruments of death, and listening gently, for she was too well-bred to seem bored, but yet looking, with her white face, and in her black dress which touched the big piles of shot, like the Iphigenia of war. Her hands lay in her lap, and she was quite silent. Was she thinking of the old house in Moscow, of the evening sunlight on the big brass gun that had once filled up the garden-terrace there, and of that other spring-day, when a boy-lover had been beside her, and when life too had been in its spring ? And the war-maimed man near her now ! What did he think of? He thought simply where, when, and how, was he to see her again ? But that was not what he said. As they walked away at last down the nave, and he took her out to her carriage, he asked her only, \" Have you much gaiety in prospect ? \" \u2014 a deadly stupid and unidealised question to have put to her, as any reader will at once say.

Vera answered that they had been very quiet, had dined at their Embassy, and been three times to the Opera, but that she was going to-morrow to a garden-party at the Duchess of J 's. \" Where I may hope to meet you.\" Then they separated; Vera hoping that it would not rain to-morrow ; and certainly the hope of meet ing her pleasant friend of Roman memories gave more zest to her anticipations than she could have supposed. \" How one likes any one one has ever met in Rome,\" she said to her father at dinner. \" Rome ? Ah ! yes, Rome ; a charming town. But for the commissariat Rome would be a perfectly delightful winter residence, but that I must say is infamous, and I cannot manage to live on an orange, a little shade, and a great deal of enthusiasm in the way you can do, ma file. That Colonel St. John is a remarkably clever man ; in our country that man would be employed. I call that a solidly well-informed man. Now, his appreciation to-day of my ideas about that small French field-piece was quite remarkable ; he says there are some models at a museum belonging to his club that will interest me; I shall certainly go with him to see them.\" Oh, Cupid ! how many fathers, and possible fathers-"], [137, "A LONDON SEASON. 125 iu-law, do you not daily deceive in this barefaced way ? The weather, which might have turned Princess Vera's fete into the most dreary of solemnities, happened to be propitious, and the afternoon was one on which the English climate and English suburban scenery show to most advantage. There was a general flush and abun dance of greenery, doubly pleasant to the eye when it is set off as it was here by white and rosy blossoms, hung with tassels of lilac and laburnum, and crowned with spires of horse-chestnut flowers. The turf was velvety, sunny, and smooth, and gay groups clustered about it, sitting under the shade of the trees, or dropping out of sight where the beautiful lawn sloped away to the south. It appeared that Princess Vera Zamiatine was to be the fashion this season. She had come to London ten days ago, knowing, at the outside, ten people in it ; to-day she was universally courted and made much of. Colonel St. John saw her admired, and heard her praised, and if he never joined in the chorus it was because a voice in the depth of his own heart said but too loudly how lovely, fair, and unspoilt she was. About six o'clock he found himself seized upon by Lady Mortlake. \" Oh ! Colonel St. John, is there a hope of finding you disengaged, and able to dine with us on Saturday ?"], [138, "126 VERA, I hope we may be able to persuade you. It is to meet these Russians : you know them, I think ? \" \" Yes, they are old Roman friends of mine. It is very kind of you, Lady Mortlake ; and I shall be delighted to have the honour.\" \" On Saturday, then, and at eight. We are rather punctual people, you know.\" \" I know you are. How is Lord Mortlake's gout ? \" \"Pretty well just now, thanks. How well that girl dresses, to be sure \" (putting up her eyeglass as she spoke to inspect Vera, who was standing on the grassy bank above her). \" Yes ; and so simply.\" \" Now, that is so like a man to say that ! Why that white dress has cost money untold.\" \" Has it ? So much the better for the milliner ; it could not be better for the wearer.\" \"No; it really could not. We all look so dowdy beside her.\" The toilet in question was one of those marvellous constructions of white muslin, lace, and needlework which only Paris can produce, and which one must almost be a rich man's only child to have a right to wear. Vera's appearance in it to-day made her an object of envy to many, and all combinations of colours and stripes among the company did, as Lady Mortlake expressed"], [139, "127 A LONDON SEASON it, seem dowdy beside her spotless freshness. Her maid had christened it \" la robe de bdbd.\" * The garden-party, after going off much as all such parties do, was over ; but Colonel St. John, now more love-smitten than ever, had the dinner at Lord Mort lake's to look forward to. It also was successful when it came. The host took, as it happened, his pretty foreign guest to dinner, but Colonel St. John found himself on her other side, making plans for her amusement in London, which were promising for the future, and also pleasant to Lord Mortlake in the meantime. His lord ship was a little \u2014 no, not a little \u2014 deaf on one side (that on which the Princess was seated), and he had therefore foreseen himself obliged to choose between her silvery conversation and the very excellent dinner before him. Colonel St. John's happy and opportune fluency it was which now allowed him to devote himself to the latter, and no doubt it was pleasanter so, both for the young people and for Lord Mortlake, though perhaps it was wrong, for his lordship had the gout the next day ; and I am told that he kept his room for a week. He said \" that it was the strawberries,\" and they are bad for the gout. Thanks to some of the arrangements made that evening, their brief London season was full of amusement * \" The baby's frock.\""], [140, "128 VERA, for the Zamiatines. Military and feminine taste were alike gratified by the way in which Colonel St. John had catered for them ; the military element perhaps, predominating as was unavoidable. Prince Michael made a business of it. He visited every barrack in and near London (and some very nasty ones he saw), and his daughter was taken to see the Guard mounting at St. James's, where she beheld with her bodily eyes, the men, and the successors of the men, who twice in thin red line had met and vanquished the flower of the Russian infantry. Owing to his recent inspection of their barracks, Prince Michael Zamiatine was recognized by some of the men, and soldiers with Crimean medals on their breasts grinned on seeing their old enemy \" the Rooshians \" appear among them in the novel shape of one bluff old gentleman with a thick white moustache, and one young girl in a black gauzy dress, and with a face, as some one had said, \"like a guelder rose.\" Then there was a day in Windsor Forest, and two hot hours at the Royal Academy, and more of what Vera laughingly called her \" Kdtorga,\" * at the Exhibi tion, and even a review at Aldershott, where the black peaty dust filled her mouth and eyes, and where they lunched in a hut in the South Camp, so pretty and so * Hard labour, in the penal sense of the word."], [141, "129 A LONDON SEASON. luxuriously fitted up as not even to suggest the mimicry of campaigning life, and where, through its open windows, and its pink fluttering curtains, you saw the rolling, heathy country, and the blue misty horizon, and heard the roll of the drums, aud the bands thundering together in \"God Save the Queen;\" and then home by train, at express speed, to dinner at the Embassy in Chesham Place, and later to a reception at X House. \" You don't know how tired I am,\" Vera said, when she met Colonel St. John there ; and then she detailed her experiences while he found a chair for her. \"How very pretty this is,\" she continued, for the great saloon was full of exotics, and the outer vestibule had been turned into a miniature palm-grove. \" It looks like a fairy island in the South Seas,\" she said. \"Will you not go upstairs, then, and see the natives ? \" he asked, and they began to mount the staircase, which, from a double spring, ascends to the gallery and the reception rooms above. Princess Vera, in white, with half of her hair on her shoulders, and with no ornaments but her pearls, was one of the most remarkable people in the company. \"That's the Russian beauty, there on the stair,\" said somebody; \"and the man beside her is the Colonel St. John, who lost his arm in the Crimea,\" 1)"], [142, "130 VERA. said somebody else, and so on, with various comments on her appearance. Her comment was : \"Every London party is like the other ; the crowd is as great in a palace like this as it is in a small house; and the women have worse dresses and prettier faces than any other people in the world.\" If Colonel St. John had not been an Englishman, he might have seized this opportunity of telling her, with a bow, that she combined both beauties of dress and person, but such speeches were not in his line. He was trying to hide from himself and from others that he was very much in love, and that with a woman twenty years younger than himself, and who, probably, only thought of him as an old friend of her mother's, and only liked him for her sake. If ever a man had felt inclined to do like Ponce de Leon, * and go off to the Antipodes in search of that \" Fontaine de Jouvence \" which was fabled to give a man back his youth, Colonel St. John had felt ready during the last fortnight to do so. Alas ! for the nineteenth century and its heroes ; no broth of Medea, and no distant fountain can even promise them help, and my hero could only debate with himself whether to give up the pursuit, or even * The situation of the \" Fontaine de Jouvence, cui fit rajovenir la gent\" is uncertain.

And suddenly their host shot past them, and ran downstairs, and, in another second, the band striking up the National Anthem, a royal party, English and foreign, entered the saloon. Then the crowd altered its direction, and followed these distinguished personages, when they got upstairs, into the great gallery, and the space where the Zamiatines were sitting was left comparatively deserted. Colonel St. John was then, by an accident, saved, as he thought, from risking his fate on a point-blank question and answer. His eyes fell on a couple seated behind one of the pillars. They were a boy and girl, so absorbed in each other's society, as to be oblivious of the fact that the recession of the public into the gallery and supper-room had left them rather prominently alone. They were whispering, smiling, and colouring, they were as fair as cherubs, as like as two cherries. They were obviously cousins, and were both under nineteen years of"], [144, "132 VERA, age. Both were slender, both had unclouded eyes, young lips, and young voices. Vera, noticing them also, smiled. \" They look like the prince and princess of my fairy island,\" she said. \" What a pity your natives will come and disturb them.\" \" Yes, they are really two pretty children. How old do you suppose our young friends to be ? \" \" Seventeen or eighteen, I suppose ; and, if they are not happy now, when will they ever be ? \" \" Then you should say that theirs was the right age for that sort of thing \u2014 for making love, or having it made to you? \" Vera, without the slightest idea of the arriere pcnsee in this question, answered, and with the greatest prompti tude, that she did think so, and her companion at first rejoined not a word, only, two minutes after, he said, with a grave, good-natured smile, which betrayed no annoyance, \"Well, no matter. You are right, I have no doubt : and Eros, we should remember, was a very little boy.\" And then Vera laughed, and there the con versation ended. Colonel St. John, as he lit his cigar, and walked home through the stable-yard, said to himself, \" Once for being poor, and once for being old, ought to be enough for any fellow who is not an even greater ass than myself.

Delightfully unconscious of any mistake on her part was the smiling Princess Vera when they next met, which they did three days after at a dinner at Richmond. During those three days she had missed Colonel St. John, and had begun to discover that his society was not only very essential to her happiness, but that life with his presence was very different from what it had been ever since her mother's death, when its oppressive loneliness had broken down her health and nerves. To-day she was to make a further discovery ; certainly, however, not the one that she had either hurt or rebuffed her friend. Of that Colonel St. John was too much"], [147, "THE DAY AFTER THE FAIR. 135 master of himself to give any sign. He was only a little vexed, he said, at the contretemps of a thunder storm, but the rain cleared off at last, and as they drove back into town by Roehampton, Barnes, and Fulham, even this ceased to be a matter for regret. It was late, and the evening was one of those which can only be enjoyed after rain in summer-time, and which out of England cannot be known. Great white pillowy clouds were packing away in the north, and the masses of the ancestral trees were thrown into alternate shadow and splendour, as they caught, or missed, the lingering bright ness in the west. The leaves were glistening, and all the woods were fragrant, and the deer stirred among the deep ferns, as they bowled along over the smooth gravel. Later still, and as evening almost deepened into night, marvellous odours of gardens began to come to them across low brick walls, where the first June roses were replacing the Wisteria chains, where hops and clematis scrambled, and where the guelder roses tossed their creamy heads, still heavy with the summer shower. And before they reached London a few stars began to twinkle in the sky, and to throw trembling reflections into the river, where the black barges were slowly tack ing up, helped by the rising tide. Vera sat very silent : her heart was troubled and yet glad. With a perfectly pleasant and trusted com-"], [148, "136 VERA, panion at her side, and in the perfumed quiet of that night in June, what wonder then that it had stirred at last, that the Russian girl grew to love the Englishman and the English country, that she longed to grasp at happiness, as a baby holds out its hands for all the flowers that it may pass. A shooting-star glittered just then in the sky : Vera remembered the super stition that the wish formed during the falling of a star is granted, and clasping her hands on her lap, she raised her eyes, and whispered her wish, \u2014 \"His love.\" Then the star fell, and the carriage turned off the bridge into the Fulham lanes, and they were soon among the streets and shops, and all the London din. This was on Thursday night. Friday was a wet and an uneventful day, till at dinner Michael Zamiatine suddenly said something of \" Tuesday, when we go down to Folkestone.\" \" Tuesday! \" ejaculated Vera, setting down the glass she had at her lips. \" Yes, I see the hour suits better on Wednesday for the tidal boat; but we may as well sleep at Folkestone.\" And very little dinner did Vera eat after this piece of information, and very little did she enjoy her box at the opera to hear Fidelio. Now and then the tender pathos and perfect finish of a great actress choked her, and stirred in the girl all that power of possible devo-"], [149, "THE DAY AFTER THE FAIR. 137 tion which was the substratum of her character. Like Mde. Swetchine, Vera could always say, that while she loved God with all her strength, her heart had still much love to give away, without taking anything from Him, and, poor girl, a vista had just opened for her into that old, cold, dreary, loveless life. It terrified her. It is not to be said how restless she was all the next day. Many were its engagements, but none of them brought about a meeting with Colonel St. John. On Sunday morning \u2014 such was her new Anglomania \u2014 she determined to go to an English church, and to see how the English worshipped. I don't know what precise reasons she gave for the step to her father, but he was rather pleased than otherwise to be let off his service in Welbeck Street, though by reason of the heat he advised her to go to the nearest one she could find. To the nearest church she accordingly betook herself, with her maid. She found herself in a frowzy, and half-empty building, where an indifferent organ led some execrable singing, and where service, indistinctly read at the best, was almost drowned by the rattle of another thunderstorm, which broke over the town a little after midday. Julie, the maid, was horribly frightened, and cried \"Dieu!\" very audibly at each crash. When a second ill-sung hymn had ended, then another priest from the altar began to"], [150, "138 VERA, read. He was an old man, and lion-like, and his voice, though deep and fervent, seemed to shake with earnestness, as you have seen a bridge sway over a torrent that roars and chafes just beneath it.

Vera turned pale : this was the way he prayed to whom her heart had begun to cleave : and hiding her face in her hands, she knelt down and prayed an English prayer, in English speech. Often in later days she remembered it. It seemed at one time to have been but a vain, a sighing breath, \u2014 but not so \u2014 He to whom it was addressed is the Father of all races, and kindreds, and tongues, and it is no small matter, even when our personal hopes are ruined, to have caught, be it at the price of such a sorrow, a glimpse of the great paternity of God. In the afternoon she had hoped to remain at home, feeling sure that at five o'clock Colonel St. John would appear, but Prince Michael was seized with a sudden and perverse wish to walk, and to have his daughter to walk with him : and so the hapless Vera went to the Park, saw everybody she did not care to meet, and came home late, and tired, to find Colonel St. John's card. She could not blame any one, and no one could help her. On Monday her last chance was gone, and on"], [151, "139 THE DAY AFTER THE FAIR. Tuesday, as had been settled, they went down to Folke stone, and ate their dinner to the sound of the waves. The tidal-boat was early next morning, and long before midday the white English cliffs had disappeared, hidden in heavy rain-clouds, while the packet pitched and leaped, and bore away to other climes one of the most reluctant beings who ever left our hospitable shores. The lonely life had begun again. In Paris, Vera rose at seven, and walked with her maid for an hour. At 5 p.m. she drove with her father ; and once, as a great favour, he had taken her to the Bois at night : but she did not ask him to repeat that experiment often, \u2014 for she was trying to conquer herself, and she found that that was best done in the dull hotel looking into the Place Vendome, or in shopping \u2014 in anything rather than in allowing tender memories to rise when the night air was perfumed and sweet, and when stars, lamps, car riages, trees, lakes, and flowers, all were covered with that strange air of mystery and romance which is nowhere to be felt more strongly than at night in the Bois de Boulogne. She was trying to conquer herself, to harden her heart, to wean it from all hopes, and also to forget. To forget ! Trivial natures do it easily ; coarse ones will even boast that they never remember.

Rocked by such a nurse as Patience, any memory will go to sleep at length. But the task is to keep it asleep. Some touch disturbs it, and then up it starts, fresh and living as before ; and on the day when it so wakens, and when the heart is made sick with the old recurring pain, there is nothing left but to pray that the way may be short, and the time at hand, of which a Father has solemnly sworn to us that He can then \" make all things new.\""], [153, "141 CHAPTER XVI. AN OLD AND A NEW EARL OF KENDAL. What great pain can there he in death, which is but a continued swooning, a sweet ignorance of cares, and a never-again returning to the works and dolorous felicity of life ? \u2014 Dkummond of Hawthoknden. From such distractions as the closing weeks of that London season might offer to Colonel St. John after Princess Vera had left England, and left it blind to his suit, he was very soon called away by the sickness of Lord Kendal. The old peer had had a paralytic seizure the winter before, and Colonel St. John, feeling ever since that his life was held by a very slender tenure, hurried down at the first word of illness to Hurst Royal. He had not been summoned, but the tone of his uncle's letter made him uneasy, and he only waited to apprise the Newbolds, then in L \u2014 shire, of his anxiety, till a personal visit to the invalid had either removed or con firmed his fears. Evening was deepening into night as he reached"], [154, "142 VERA. the station, and then drove on at a rapid pace towards the house. The air was heavy with dew, faint wreaths of white mist hung about the hollows, and the shadows of the woods were both gloomy and dark. All chilled his spirits, and added to his dread of some sudden termination to Lord Kendal's malady. Might he not, he asked himself, be even now too late ? Reason replied that people do not die of a first paralytic stroke, and Fear retorted that the malaise of two days ago might have portended a second one, and his heart sunk within him. Just then a large goat-sucker swept out of the thicket, and flew away up the avenue before him, now wheeling and now alighting, as it continued its ill omened flight just in front of his horses' heads. While he despised himself for such a piece of superstition, he had a sense of dread, or, rather, of dislike, to this bird with the noiseless, bat-like wings, even when at last it settled in an ilex-tree, from which its long and plaintive note went sounding across the glades in the direction of the house. There was nearly a mile before him still, and once rid of the presence of the night-jar, memory began her wondrous tale, and rehearsed to Colonel St. John all the events of a lifetime, and with them the unalterable faith fulness of the man who had not only taken a father's"], [155, "AN OLD AND A NEW EARL OF KENDAL. 143 place for him, but who had also known how to give to their tie the larger charm of friendship. Once only had Lord Kendal crossed his nephew's will, and that had been in the matter of Miss Georgiana Lindley, when, at twenty -two years of age, Henry St. John had proposed to lay his heart, his bearskin, and his pros pects at that young lady's feet. Her relations had disapproved of a match with the son of the man whose speculations had, through Mrs. Lindley's folly, ruined the family ; but Lord Kendal had done more, he had firmly refused any consent to it, and it was not till many years later that his nephew learnt to know his motives. Mrs. Lindley had been the old peer's only love, and she had first jilted him for a younger and richer neighbour, and then, as a widow, laid herself open to the addresses of his brother John, an impudent profligate, who had an eye to nothing but her jointure. He had thus received a double blow from her ; and it had been to avoid this lady, whether as wife or widow, that Lord Kendal had shut himself up from intercourse with his neighbours and fellows. There was little enough it is true in his old idol, worldly-minded and foolish as she was, to cause this sacrifice of a life, and yet the peer had virtually sacrificed his life either to her memory or to his grievance. For this is a matter in which people deceive themselves, especially if they allow themselves"], [156, "144 VERA. to be entirely ruled by their recollections, instead of looking at life through the claims and duties of to-day. Of all artists, ancient or modem, commend me to Memory. It is there that we find the most careful eclecticism, the most genuine romance. We call Memory faithful, but that is the very thing that it is not, and that perhaps we would not wish it to be. How does it not with golden pencil touch and retouch the picture of our past lives ! it now draws out this detail and now suppresses that, now throws one fact into the background, and now magnifies another. Out of the harsh daguerreotype of a past reality it can not only make a lovely and picturesque sketch, but the sketch becomes an alto-relievo, and at last the figure in relief develops into the perfect statue. And for this statue, affection having prepared a golden niche, the image remains in it for ever more, the object of our perennial, and a3 we fancy, faithful worship. Peculiarly true is this if the life has been voluntarily, or involun tarily, deprived of movement, novelty, and change. There is then no standard of reality by which to try our im pressions, and gradually those which we ascribe to Memory become in reality the new and ever new creations by which the \" hollow heart \" has tried to fill its vacant places. But by such a process as this, how was it possible,"], [157, "AX OLD AND A NEW EARL OF KENDAL. 145 Colonel St. John asked himself, to account for the life which had mouldered away at Hurst Royal ? The Earl's had been indeed an existence sacrificed to wounded feeling, and mistaking the caprices of a morbid imagi nation for the needs of the affections, he had come first to fancy himself, and then to be, unfit for the inter course of his fellows. There could be no doubt, on the other hand, of his wish to see his nephew's happiness secured, and Henry St. John saw in this anxiety at once another proof of Lord Kendal's love for himself, and a regretful protest against the possibility of another wifeless and childless inheritor of their name. Now that his strength was failing him, the old man had called his heir to him, less to see him die, than to make arrangements for his wel fare; for all satirist as he was, Lord Kendal had fallen into the common error of supposing that though you have made a muddle of your own life, you are not the less capable of directing, or at least suggesting, the line of conduct which your neighbour is to pursue, and which if followed is infallibly to bring him the happiness you have always missed. How little either title, wealth, or the good intentions of friends could do for him at this moment, Henry St. John knew best, yet if in his drive to Hurst Royal he forecast for himself a life as ungratified as had been 10"], [158, "146 VERA. his uncle's, he hugged himself at least in the thought that he had nothing to be ashamed of : that in the pure and quiet world of Vera's heart, there was not one greedy or capricious thought, and that if, in marrying a man of her own age, instead of one so much her senior, she consulted her taste, or what was likely to be best for her own happiness, he at least had no right to complain. His affection for the young Russian lady had never been more than tacitly expressed to Lord Kendal, but that it had been thoroughly understood was plain, for it seemed that so long as she was in England the sick man had kept his sufferings a secret from his nephew, and left him to try his fortune in London undisturbed by cares. \" We will speak of it all to-morrow,\" the Earl said abruptly, after a half-hour's visit from his heir, and Henry St. John felt, as he left the room, that there was a something ominous in the phrase : he guessed to what subject it applied, and felt that Lord Kendal must know, or think himself very near death, before he intruded on his nephew's feelings. The old peer sitting in his wonted chair in the library, scorned any of the paraphernalia of illness, but he looked very feeble, and his voice was weak. Weaker than it had been nine weeks ago, so Colonel St. John said to himself as he"], [159, "AN OLD AND A NEW EARL OF KENDAL. 147 stood in his own room, and looked out absently into the summer night. Below the window lay the garden pleasance, a favourite view of his own, where the sward stretched smoothly towards the edge of the woods, dotted here and there by evergreens, and by a few noble trees. On one extremity of the ground lay the garden, with its stiff beds, clipped yews, and stacks of holly hocks, and on the other rose a grove of beech-trees. Through the avenues of their pale grey stems the moon light now straggled, playing about their tall boles, and throwing their shadows far across the bowling-green and the turf. A loud knock at the door startled him as he stood. \" Will you come into the library, sir ! I fear his lordship is gone,\" cried a hoarse voice, and without another question or answer he hurried along. There, in his accustomed chair at the table, still sat the Earl, his little black skull-cap was in his hand, an open book was laid across his knee, the shaded lamp was burning, but the jaw had dropped, and he was dead. \" Had he felt ill ?

If Colonel Newbold's county neighbours in L shire, round what is called his country-seat of Blakesmere, were like county neighbours round other people's country seats, viz., persons suffering chronically from lack of new ideas, and new matter for general conversation, grateful ought they to have been to the Newbold family about this period of the world's history. In 1862-3, they could discuss Lady Anne's newly acquired precedence, and, in 1863-4, the further fact that the family at Blakesmere were to spend their next winter in the south of France. Thirdly, and lastly, a splendid question about them was started : what chance had Lady Anne of marrying a handsome cousin of her hus band's then \"in residence,\" to the new Earl of Kendal? In pity perhaps for his loneliness, that gentleman was asked a great deal to Blakesmere, and when there he"], [164, "152 VERA, met Miss Harrington, to whom he was, after his manner to all women and children, exceedingly kind and cour teous : so much so, that not only did the neighbours suffer extremely from curiosity, but the mistress of the house herself began to be restless, and to put out feelers in that direction. Would Henry accompany them to Nice for the winter ? she wrote to ask, making a mental resolution that if he would, Auriole Harrington should also be of the party. She got the following answer : \u2014 \" Nothing would tempt me to such a dustheap, and I wonder at Newbold's rashness in going, where, in self defence, a man must become either a botanist or a gambler.

Nobody needs it more.\" It was curious how in her mind the facts of being a wife and a mother had obliterated the difference of age between them, and she often assumed an air of wisdom and experience that tickled Lord Kendal not a little. \" Why don't you marry?\" she said to him rather abruptly one afternoon, as they sat together in her"], [165, "153 SISTERLY COUNSELS, boudoir, with the children playing near them in a window. \" Because I do not wish to be bored.\" \" No man would be less so.

On this Alexei Dimitrivitch the widow's hopes had then been built. When he left the Corps des Pages at nineteen, she thought Alexis would rise ; her Alexis, too, would be sure to marry well. Alas ! before two years were out, Alexis was \" wedded to his grave,\" \u2014 his grave under the Crimean snows. The war crippled her finances, as it did those of almost all the nobles in Russia, and she had had to contend for some time with both sorrow and poverty, while her surroundings were made sadder by a universal mourning, by a scarcity through the length and breadth of the land, by the death of the great Czar, and by the many subsequent changes among the members of official life in Russia. She had lived on in Moscow, or near one of the great convents, and now, just as she was recovering from all these adverse things, she was called on to face, and with reluctance, the loss of her personal charms.

Between these two courses she wavered, till habit, stronger than principle, cast its weight into the scale of devotion. In her rooms, which were never aired, there lingered a constant smell of incense, probably from the evening service of the night before, for Countess Pascha liked to have prayers said in her house, and she liked, after prayers, to have the priest, and any nuns who might be her visitors, to tea. On such occasions she believed that she had ceased to regret the world of courts and camps to which she had once belonged. Yet when Prince Michael's invita tion reached her, it did not cost her any very great effort to tear herself away from the routine inside of which she had for some time cultivated so assiduously the welfare of her body and of her soul. Nice, she had heard, was good for old sprains, and she told her confidential friends that she hoped to find it so, as her ankle was still weak.

With these dispositions, then, to please and be pleased, Aunt Pascha settled herself at Nice, in a beau tiful villa on the Promenade des Anglais. The rooms were au premier, and undeniably luxu rious ; a garden wall and eight superb cypress-trees separated the house from the roadway, so that by day there was less glare, dust, and noise than might have been expected ; only at night you heard the loud boom of the waves, and their recession, as they \"drew the tinkling pebbles down the beach,\" and far away to the westward you saw the lights of Antibes.

How she might like a winter of Countess Zotoff's society was a question she had not yet put to herself, for Princess Vera was naturally amiable, and not apt to be critical ; but ere long that question forced itself on her, and finally, she had to confess that half a year of Aunt Pascha's regime was likely to be a severe trial to her taste and temper. She took herself severely to task for this. \" How I must have altered,\" she said to herself. \" How touchy and selfish I must have grown, to be so often out of patience with poor Aunt Pascha. Not only she means well, but I used to be fond of her. Of course it was a little for Alexis' sake then ; but she was very kind to me.

The Countess was a very obstinate woman, and her vanity required constant feeding to prevent its becoming vicious. About her charge she was very little inclined, after the first, to trouble herself; soon considering it more Michael Wassilievitch's place to devote himself to her, than hers to go to charges for his daughter. She was physically indolent, and averse to exertions of either mind or body, though her indolence did not always prevent her being fidgety and exacting. Curious to say but without ever having committed a grave fault, without that either cruelty, gallantry, or any other con spicuous vice could be laid at her door, there was in this woman an absence of positive virtue that not only contrasted forcibly with Vera's mother, but gave to her character a tinge of all the vices in turns.

She was religious from egotism, and nursed her soul, as she did her body, lest anything should happen to it, rather than from any devotion to that Supreme Object for whose knowledge and fruition the soul itself was formed. She averred that she did not care for society, but not the less did she at the end of her first month in Nice, resent her own insignificant place in it. Vera was much admired, but that only made matters worse, and, as she said, \" made the girl conceited,\" so she deter mined to retreat, and after the first month went no more into the world. The world, you may be sure, did not follow her ; thus her spiritual exercises were un disturbed, and her only distractions were her dog, the visits of a certain Dr. Prosch, who manipulated her ankle, and endless games of cards with Prince Michael, who never opened a book, and whose evenings, now that he was growing elderly, often hung heavy on his hands.

She found a chaperon every evening in an old friend of her mother's, a Princess Kourbsky, who, as having been a member of their society during that winter in Rome, was always dear to Vera. Katiche Kourbsky, as her friends called her, was a clever, strong-minded woman, repulsively plain, but pleasing withal, very animated, and gifted with that intelligence at once keen and supple, which distinguishes so many of her compatriots. She was a thorough woman of the world, always practical, good-tempered, and shrewd ; holding Countess Zotoff's pietism and her pretensions both in the greatest contempt, and having a proportionate pity for Vera, which was increased when she discovered the skeleton in the girl's cupboard. She had an uncongenial home, she was not unlikely, so Princess Kourbsky thought, soon to have Countess Pascha for a stepmother, and now it would appear that she had also a hopeless attachment for an Englishman whom 'she was not very likely to see again.

But the absence of domestic virtues in this young Muscovite mattered not to Countess Zotoff. She would always say that Prince Serge was handsome and noble, his family was as old as any in the province, and his mother, of devout memory, a friend of her own. Then if he was penniless, Vera was rich, and at all hazards she would be so glad to be rid of her, that no pretender to the Princess' hand could come amiss. And this one was an orthodox Russian, she further begged you to observe, and was not his name in the first copy of the Rodoslovnia Kniga of Ivan III., and what more would Vera have ? The reader no doubt has been much more clear sighted than was Prince Michael's daughter, and has already guessed, along with Princess Kourbsky, that as backgammon had succeeded to chess, chess to ecarte, and ecarte to piquet on the tables of the Villa Belloni, so had a courtship, in all the forms, succeeded to the sort of elderly philandering with which Aunt Pascha and Michael Wassilievitch had begun their winter together. It was now finally agreed between them that Vera's marriage should be the signal for a match which had very nearly taken place twenty-nine years before, and which was to ensure the happiness of their declining years."], [189, "TASTES DIFFER. 177 Vera, the person most interested in this arrangement, was the last to suspect it, and also the last to hear of it. No one ventured to tell her, till Countess Zotoff, in order to make assurance doubly sure, hinted at it so plainly one day in her father's presence, that his daugh ter, after receiving a very hypocritical kiss from her step mother-to-be, and, after kissing her hand in return, gazed blankly in his face. The old gentleman hemmed, coughed, cleared his throat, stroked his moustache, and then attempting a joke, mumbled out something about its being Vera's duty to set them all a good example. \" Yes, yes ; we hope soon to wish you joy, my dear,\" echoed Countess Zotoff, and Vera left the room, to digest, as best she might, her first genuine anger, and her first disenchantment with the world, and all that it con tained. Odious enough was the prospect, as far as she her self was concerned, to have the alternative of marrying Serge Donskoi, or of having Aunt Pascha fastened to her, not as a visitor, or as a temporary infliction, but as a stepmother, and as her mother's successor. But what could her father be made of, to forget that mother so soon ? \u2014 the woman whose tender, heroic spirit had made every hour noble, and her home beautiful, while she lived, and whose unseen presence still seemed to hover about her only child. 12"], [190, "178 VERA. \" Queen ! mother ! best blessing and darling ! \" Vera sobbed, as she fell on her knees beside the bed, \" is it not enough that you are dead, and gone, and that I am alone, and hungry, and cold ? \u2014 why do they insult you ? \u2014 does no one love you now but me ? Mammy ! mammy ! \" she cried, and wept out her angry pain in hot and streaming tears. When she rose from her knees she was quieter ; but she avoided her father all day, and not one syllable on the subject could she bring herself to utter at any time. People respected her silence, seeing that she went about as before, to balls and walking parties, albeit quite pre occupied and depressed by this great and unexpected grievance. Princess Kourbsky, of course, saw by her face that Anna Feodorovna's child was now in possession of the most bitter piece of knowledge she could ever acquire, and guessed the form which her meditations on it were not unlikely to take. But there were days on which Vera could hardly persuade herself that it was true, and that her mother was already forgotten. She recalled her daily and hourly charms, her wit, and refinement of mind and body, and asked herself how it was that a man who had had such a companion for more than twenty years should seek out and appropriate the most vapid and bigoted woman of his acquaintance ? It was most bitter"], [191, "TASTES DIFFER. 179 to have to blame her father, and, from induction, to begin to suspect what her mother's life with him had been : not only a struggle, as Vera well knew, with bodily pain, but a ceaseless crucifixion of self, adapting herself to the lower level of her husband, serving a man whose nature was inferior to her own, and hiding all his faults, for so loyal and docile had she been, that no hint had ever escaped her, from which Vera could now infer that Princess Anna had felt any irk, privation, or strain. Living humbly with men, and superbly alone in the communion of God, adoring her child, yet never over exciting that child's exquisite sensibility \u2014 such had been Prince Michael's wife ; and now Countess Pascha, with her dog, and her quack doctor, and her pettish, prejudiced mind, seemed likely to suit him as well, or better ! Any worldly-wise woman could have explained it all to Vera in one sentence, by telling her that, whereas Anna Feodorovna never flattered her husband, Prascovia Borisovna would be sure to do so. But Vera, poor child, was still an idealist, and was only gaining her experience that the people who came up to the ideal standard are few, and far between, exiles from another region, \" strangers yet,\" and as such easily dispensed with by those who cannot understand their aims, their"], [192, "180 VERA, language, or their hopes. They may do a great deal of good in the world, but they do not fit into it. \" Holy things for holy persons,\" says St. John Chrysostom, in his Office of the Mass, and Princess Anna had been but indifferently suited by nature for the place she filled ; nor, supposing her to have forecast this second marriage, would she have been, in her wise humility, much sur prised to see an inferior preferred before her. It was weeks before Vera could recover her calm ness. She dreaded and hated the change in herself which had too surely followed upon the change she saw in others ; she was restless and forlorn, only too dignified for complaint, though the beautiful sunshine on sea and shore seemed to mock her angry and solitary spirit. From this wretchedness of hers grew Serge Donskoi's best hope, his chance of fairly starving the place into submission. He had the wit to appreciate the situation, and pressed the siege so unremittingly that Vera at last was seen to parley. She despised herself for her weak ness, but she had no hopes of succour. Serge was affectionate and kind, he might be worthless, but he was winning ; and as he talked to her of old days in Moscow and in Rome, she relented so far as not only to dance a good deal with him, but to ask him often to the house to play duets with her.

It happened that the spring of 1865, was one of unusual severity, and by March not only were the crests of the mountain chains beyond the Var, and the Paillon, covered, but Mont Chauve himself, the hill that forms a background to Nice, and generally shelters it from the north, had a white mantle over his head, and on his bare flanks."], [195, "A MARCH THAT COMES IN LIKE A LION. 183 It happened also that Mrs. St. John selected the period of this inclement weather for a course of social pleasures, and of consequent imprudences, and that the result of the last of her Carnival amusements was a very bad attack of bronchitis. By the end of the tenth day she was in such absolute danger that Lord Kendal was telegraphed for from England, summoned, as the New bolds thought, really only to see her die. His lordship had, in the previous summer, formed, and even expressed, as we heard, a serious intention of avoiding Nice, as a place where he was likely again to encounter his \"pebble-hearted\" princess, and he would have had every one (himself included) know that he was not a man to flutter like a moth round a candle. Yet, such is human nature, so fallible, and so fond of being tempted, that it might be unkind here to pursue the inquiry of how far Lord Kendal was not well pleased to be called thither, especially to go furnished with so excellent an excuse or motive. Suffice it to say that he felt no ill-will to his stepmother's bronchitis, and that when, on his arrival, Mrs. St. John was found, like that classic dog of Mother Hubbard's, \"laughing,\" viz. recovering admirably, his satisfaction with her was complete.

The only drawback to her plans was that in his capacity of a musician, and artist, Prince Serge had contrived to beg, or steal, an entree to the green-room, and she feared that she might not be always able there to keep him and Vera separate. She put great trust however in M. Gouache's power of boring the girl about her part, could only hope for the best. When Lord Kendal joined her party on Thursday night, he found, as his hostess had said, various acquaintances among the hundred or so of persons collected in her rooms, and all now seated in rows of chairs, waiting for the curtain to draw up. But in these rows of people no Princess Vera was to be descried. He glanced at the programme which he had in his hand, and there read her name as appearing, but in the very last tableau, so it was with some impatience that"], [200, "188 VERA. he witnessed the reproduction of various well-known pictures, all marvellously pretty effects of M. Gouache's skill in drapery, lighting, and arranging the figures. At length the curtain rose for the last time, and then the fiery little Frenchman who had planned it might well have been pleased with the success of his tableau. It elicited an instant murmur of applause. The light in it was strong, but it was level, as if of a sunset, and the gleaner held one hand above her eyes so as to shade them. On her head, separated from her long fair hair by a crimson kerchief, was a sheaf of wheat ears, and another bunch of these lay on the arm which rested on her girdle. Both arms were bare, firm and pure as marble, only the fingers had faint rosy tinges about their tips ; she wore curious flat metal bands above the elbow, and from the uplifted arm a large, wide, white linen sleeve had fallen back. M. Gouache's tableau was pronounced to be a perfect study of colour. Princess Kourbsky looked at the face : when the curtain drew up the level looking, serious eyes had seemed to gaze wearily before them into the distance, as if indeed longing for that succour and protection which the Moabitish woman sought and found in the fields of Boaz. There was something devoted, and yet plaintive in the expression which touched all hearts. Suddenly it was as if that expression had changed, and when the"], [201, "A MARCH THAT COMES IN LIKE A LION. 189 curtain fell, the artist rushed forward to Vera : \u2014 \" Ah, Princesse, you are an actress as well as an artist : you have made my fortune. Ah ! how you have known to embody the worthy sentiments of that heroine who would follow another into a strange land, and even die there ! What grace ! what a charm ! \" Serge, too, was instantly at her side. \" How charming you have been ! but are you not too tired ? What can I do for you ? You are pale.\" \" Relieve me only, I pray you, of this,\" replied Vera, as she lifted the sheaf from her head, and absently threw it down on the floor. It fell at Serge's feet. The girl was too absent, too carried away with the amazed, delighted surprise which the sight of Lord Kendal had caused her, to notice it. She trod upon air, and yet she trembled when she felt how nearly she had forfeited her own self-respect, and by encouraging Prince Serge, nearly ruined all her chances of happiness. The sight of him was now a reproach to her ; she had been basely weak to draw on a man who had no real hold upon her except through her impatience of Countess Pascha's presence and plans. Feeling ashamed, and yet glad, tired, and yet relieved, she walked quickly away to change her dress, and to escape from other congratula tions or comments. As she did so she missed the aside which her last gesture had called forth from a witty"], [202, "190 VERA. compatriot who had witnessed it : \" Voila, la belle glan euse, quidonne a manger a son ane.\" * Serge, if he did not over-hear it, either had felt all the indifference which her air betrayed, or felt that, for some reason or other, the lady of his affections was out of tune, and that he was out of favour. He might possibly have recovered from the rebuff had it not at supper been all explained to him. The one-armed Englishman, his old rival, was at Vera's side. Her eyelids were dropped, but by a jealous rival their meaning was easily read, and from that evening the young Russian nobleman went no more to the Villa Belloni. After that day the morals and manners of poor Prince Serge had a decidedly downhill tendency ; and sometimes, when he had imbibed a good deal of champagne, his strictures on female fickleness were veiy severe. For Vera, and for Lord Kendal there succeeded three weeks of great, and yet not quite unalloyed felicity : they hardly understood, or trusted each other yet. Each fearing to betray the depth and strength of their feeling for the other, now let it show itself, and now repressed it, till an anxious chaperon, like Princess Kourbsky, might some times have thought that they had quarrelled. Vera was, she said, far the most perverse of the two : and this was true, for the stronger grew her tenderness, the more she * \" See, the fair gleaner is giving her donkey something to eat.\""], [203, "191 A MARCH THAT COMES IN LIKE A LION. feared its power, and strove to hide it from every eye \u2014 from that of the man she loved, and from the vigilance of her friend, who gave parties, planned expeditions, and, by giving them every opportunity of meeting, hoped soon to bring matters to a crisis.

In the ante-room the scene was one of hurry, con fusion, and dismay ; the physicians could not hold out much hopes, and the sacraments were to be given at 2 p.m., while the sufferer was still conscious, and in the meantime his mother hardly ever for a moment left his side. Every one feared the worst. Down in the town the bad news spread rapidly. The officers of the Chasseurs a pied de la Garde Irnpe riale spread the report when they came off duty. The Prefect, when he returned to breakfast from his melan choly visit at the Villa, confirmed it ; some said that it was unexpected, some that it was only what might have been looked for ; some declared that he had caught cold at a review given in his honour on a bitterly cold day in March, when it certainly had rained torrents as he returned from the Var : in short there was much dis cussion which could not, of course, in any way alter the facts, and an atmosphere of gloom and suspense replaced the brightness and the sunny promise of the morning. A reception which had been arranged for that evening at the Prefecture was put off, but a few private"], [207, "APRIL DAYS. 195 engagements held good, even among the Russians, and thus it happened that afternoon, that at the end of a long rambling walk which had begun in the valley of the Sainte Madelaine, and ended in the gardens of the Villa Gastaud, that Princess Vera Zamiatine and Lord Kendal found themselves in each other's company, and in that of about eight other people, English and Rus sian. Her father was not of the party ; propriety kept him waiting for any possible summons to the Villa Bermont, but Princess Kourbsky was there, and another young Russian girl, an acquaintance of the Zamiatines. Vera was tired, and when the party dispersed themselves about the gardens, she sat down more than once to rest. The evening sunshine was now as beautiful as had been that of the morning. In the high trellises over her head, covered with Wisterias in luxuriant flower, the turtle doves fluttered and cooed, and down the other side of the garden there ran an avenue of Judas-trees, of which the flowering vista was only closed by the view of a sea, barred now with green and now with purple, as it was ruffled here and there by the southerly breeze. The terrace at the end of this avenue is built out into a kind of bastion, and from the benches arranged there, Vera and her companion overlooked the dusty fringe of olives that hide the line of the railway, the church, and the red roofs of St. Helene, the hundred flowering"], [208, "196 VERA, aloes on the beach, the line of surf, and all the expanse (from the Pharos of Ville Franche to the mouth of the Var) of that bay of Nice to which a fond local love has given the local name of Baio dis Anges. The conversation turned on the party at the Prefec ture, of which some of the younger members complained heavily of being disappointed. \" I am very sorry for the disappointment, and still more sorry for the cause,\" said Lord Kendal to Vera, who seemed vexed by the babble and the grumbles of a girl beside her. \"It is terribly sad. My father says the distress at the Villa Bermont is indescribable.\" \" And it seems so very uncertain whether this poor young man will live to see his father, and the Princess Dagmar.\" \" Ah, poor girl ! How right she is to come. Do you not think so ? I do feel for her, this poor Dagmara ! Do you know what her name means ? \" \"No.\" \" Day's-dawn, the making of the day. It seems such a mockery of all her hopes, when they are blighted so early, and her day is clouded before it was really made.\" And as Vera said this, her eyes filled with the tears of her ready pity. Lord Kendal who looked at her felt at once that"], [209, "APRIL DAYS. 197 he had never seen her so loveable, and also that by this very display of tenderness for others, she seemed to be more than ever removed from him ; it was as if she were a something more than ever beyond his reach. Some thing like anger actually rose in his heart against this impregnably gentle lady. \" It is indeed a sad business,\" he said, \" though I wonder that even this should have power to move you so much, a woman who seems to me to live always so much more by the head than by the heart.\" This unlooked-for attack amazed Vera. She hardly seemed to understand it at first, but Lord Kendal's eyes showed that some reproach was implied : and then, seeing that no excuse followed, she deigned not a syllable in reply, but gathering her dress about her, she rose up, and walked away. For once in the course of her gentle life she was fairly angered, and for once in the course of it her guelder-rose-coloured beauty was flushed, and with that flush there had risen up a lambent, regal anger into her eyes, which had astonished the aggressor. It seemed that the blood of five centuries of boyars, if it did not often stir in any one so gentle, and so polished, evidently could stir ; and it prevented her from exchanging another word with Lord Kendal, while it sent her home hurt, silent, and offended. She was left to her own reflections for the greater"], [210, "198 VERA. part of that evening, when Countess Zotoff and the servants went to vespers, and it was not till the next morning that a different turn was given to her thoughts, when, along with her father, she had to attend the funeral of Count Orloff. To her, and to him, these obsequies, conducted under the cloud of sickness and sorrow at their Court, and with such materials only as a French watering-place could supply, seemed at best but a maimed affair, and hardly worthy of the states man they were meant to honour. But to Western eyes, unaccustomed to Russian manners, this spectacle a la Russe was sufficiently interesting and curious. A permission for foreign troops to carry arms through the town having been asked for, and at once granted by the courteous authorities, a great body of marines from the Russian frigates accompanied the remains, trailing their muskets as they marched to the saddest and sweetest of strains \u2014 a tune which resembles a love song far more than a death march.* His son followed the coffin on foot, and then came a deputation of local dignities, and so many carriages filled with ladies in white, that the procession attracted a great deal of attention as it wound across the bridge, and all the streets and windows were lined with spectators.

Grandson of that councillor and favourite of Cathe rine H. who murdered the Czar Peter IH., himself the confidential friend of the Emperor Nicholas, and tutor at one time to the royal boy now on his death-bed, Count Orloff was also head of the police in Russia, master of great estates, and lord but very recently of many thou sands of souls ; and it had been common to credit him with sharing, if not with absolutely originating, more than one political crime. To-day, accordingly, as the funeral-car rolled out of sight among the streets in the trans-Paillon side of the town, gossip made very free with his name, and the bystanders, even while feeling some thing of the pathos of seeing this old Governor show the way on which his young prince was so soon to follow, dis cussed the sayings and doings of the silent statesman, of the courtier, who even now played the part of a master of the ceremonies as he opened the door into the presence of the King of Terrors. \" How,\" some people asked, \" how did Empress Elizabeth, wife of the Czar Alexander I., come by her death ?\" \" And how, when,"], [212, "200 VERA and where did the Grand Duke Constantine expiate the crime of being the rightful, albeit the abdicated, heir to a throne?

The silent reproachful air which Vera had worn as he saw her last, as well as the outline of her beautiful figure, when, with the doves flying about her head, and filling up the end of that vista of purple flowering trees, it had stood out sharply defined against the lines of sea and sky, haunted Lord Kendal. Thus he was tempted to do what he very seldom did, viz. pay a morning visit, and, seeking out the Princess at her house, make, if possible, his peace with her. He had never, as it happened, found her at home, or seen her with Countess Zotoff before, but he chose an hour to-day late enough to be seemly, and yet so early as that the heat would be sure to confine the inhabitants of the villa behind its closed persiennes. The ladies were"], [214, "202 VERA. at home, and he was accordingly shown into a room where Countess Zotoff was lying fanning herself on a sofa, with Marphise in a basket beside her, and where Vera, seated at the pianoforte was singing : a mezza voce, surely, for the door of the salon had been gained before her voice reached her visitor's ear. She rose, coloured a little, and then smiled as she held out her hand, but their meet ing was slightly awkward, partly from the fact that Lord Kendal brought a sort of curiosity or consciousness with him, and that Vera's timid quietness was increased by the very frigid way in which Countess Zotoff thought proper to return his bow and his presentation to herself. As that valetudinarian lady did not go out at night, they had never met before, and, if with Vera Lord Kendal was often able to forget that he was in the society of a foreigner, he saw in a glance that with Countess Zotoff it was certainly impossible to do this, for Countess Prascovia was very peculiar-looking. Like Vera, she was tall, but her sallow face, large brown eyes, narrow hands, and very pliant figure, all struck him as belonging to an unfamiliar type, and he kept calling her, in his own mind, a Scythian woman, while he got through the first formali ties with what ease he might, asking himself all the time what subjects he was likely to have in common with such a hostess. As she was an invalid, he began by hoping that a winter"], [215, "203 ZENITH. at Nice had been beneficial to her health. \"Not too much so,\" she answered, rather curtly : and it seemed as if not even the subject of her ailments \u2014 one on which she was generally abundantly fluent \u2014 could induce the Aunt Pascha to relax towards the Crimean hero, for so in her mind she had already christened him. She detested the English \u2014 English men, and English soldiers in par ticular ; and here, in her very drawing-room, and as a friend of Vera's, was an Englishman, a one-armed man, a Crimean hero, of whom she felt convinced that he had killed, and eaten, Heaven only knew how many of her compatriots. And then how the man looked at Vera ! devouring her with his eyes. He had no little presump tion certainly ; but then what business had Vera had at his incoming to blush one of her rare blushes ? Countess Pascha was very angry with them both, and Lord Kendal found her unpracticable, when, having recovered from her first snub, he said that in a winter when so many- Russians were collected in Nice, she must surely have found the society agreeable. No, she had not enjoyed it. The society of Nice was now, to say the least of it, extremely mixed. Her health did not allow her to go out at night, and the weather had been trying, with so much sirocco : and then the situation of their house was bad. \" Too sunny, perhaps,\" suggested Lord Kendal,"], [216, "204 VERA, glancing at the closed blinds, outside of which the fierce white heat was still beating, reflecting all the glare of the Promenade, and all the glitter of the sea. \" Yes, too sunny, and I do not like being so near the sea; it is terrifying how one hears the waves at night, and they have a frightful monotony.\" Besides all this, Countess Zotoff objected that they had not the whole house to themselves. There was a Piedmontese family overhead, who had given a ball, and as she thought the floor unsafe, she had been kept awake all night ; and those people were quite Garibaldian in the society they collected about them : not at all to her taste, though Vera must needs go to their dance. Then on the ground-floor there were some English people, and the boys trundled hoops, and chattered under her windows. \" They are rather nice little boys,\" put in Vera, who was so much gratified by Lord Kendal' s visit, that she would have taken a favourable view of a pair of young gorillas had they been presented to her, and who also saw with vexation, that her duenna was by no means disposed to show the best side of her character to their visitor. \" Oh, they are dreadful children ! I never like foreigners, as you know, Vera, and yet you make of these gamins.\""], [217, "ZENITH. 205 \"Do you talk to them in English?\" asked Lord Kendal. \" Yes ; and as they laugh at my mistakes without mercy, I ought to make progress. Do you not find me improved?\" \" It was I, and not you, who needed correction the last time that we met, Princess,\" and Vera smiled such an enchanting pardon, that it was lucky for her that Countess Pascha did not see her, being engaged at that moment in arranging Marphise more comfortably in her basket. That amiable animal refused however to settle, and turned from time to time such fiery glances on the stranger that they augured a dash before long at his lordship's heels. \" I fear the accounts from the Villa Bermont to-day, are such as to make every one very uneasy.\" ' ' Helas ! ' ' said the elder lady, and again Vera lifted her soft pitying eyes, so that Lord Kendal felt he might address her on that topic. They discussed the bulletin aud the funeral of Count Orloff, until the visitor rose to go. \" You were singing, I think, when I came in, and I ought not to interrupt you any longer.\" \" I was only trying to promote a siesta on the part of my aunt ; the heat is so oppressive to-day, in spite of the thunderstorm.\" \" I never sleep in the middle of the day,\" protested"], [218, "206 VERA, the Countess Pascha, who, in spite of this protest, was well known to sleep fourteen hours, on an average, out of the twenty-four. \" What was the music ? \u2014 itsounded like Schubert's.\" \" You are right, it is very like Schubert ; but it is a romance of Varlamoff's. Do you know it ? \" and going to the piano Vera bent down, still standing, and played a few bars. \" Ah ! the words are Russian, I see.\" \"Yes; but I have made some German ones for it.\" \" Which are quite disfiguring, I think,\" put in Countess Pascha. \" German is another language that I detest. Lermontoff was a Russian, and, what is more, a poet ; your words are German prose.\" \" German poetry without rhyme, please, Aunt Pascha.\" \" It is all one \u2014 all German is prosaic.\" \"Lermontoff's poem,\" continued Vera, \"would make a pretty subject for an artist ; \u2014 he says that a soul, having heard before its birth the songs of the guardian angel, who bore it down to this world, never was afterwards satisfied by any earthly strains.\" \" That I can quite believe ; but I must not intrude on you any longer.

I trust so.\" \"Yes,\" replied Vera, looking extremely pleased."], [219, "207 ZENITH. \" I am very glad to have\"] found you at home, and to have seen you to-day,\" and then Vera touched the hand of the maimed man, which she never did without a sense of pity, and Lord Kendal took leave. Her manner showed that his tacit apology had been as tacitly accepted, and he left the house in good spirits. \" My dear Vera, how very unfeeling you are ! \" began Countess Zotoff, as soon as the door had closed on the visitor. \"It is curious that on one of my worst days you should so carelessly present to me, and in my own drawing-room, and as a friend of your own, a foreigner of a sort that is sure to be obnoxious to my heart ; and, what is more, this man is paying court to you.\" \"Do you really think so ?\" asked Vera, trying to keep her voice steady. \" Do I really think so ? Vera Michailovna, anybody not born yesterday, as you always pretend to be, would think so. Why else should he come here ? \u2014 and at an hour when the heat brings out nobody but mad dogs, and Englishmen, and lizards. Give me some of that Hungary water, child !

She was glad, at any rate, that the conversation was at an end, and she went to her own room to rehearse undisturbed all her joy, and to realize the conviction which this day had brought her of Lord Kendal's strong regard for herself. She had been much hurt by his speech of yesterday, for there is no pain like the harsh misunderstanding of those we love ; it always seems so wilful and so wanton ; but then, if what la tante Pascha said was true, and if he was really paying serious court to her now, was it not rather he who might complain of being often misunderstood? How often had she misinterpreted his feelings, and his sayings ? how often must she have appeared ungrateful for his constant, and very great kindness to herself? Those grave kind cares for her happiness, that question in Rome, the sympathy he had shown her in London, when they met again after her mother's death, his much thought for her then, and at all times : if those all were proofs of love, how obdurate he must have thought her, how stupid, or how proud \u2014"], [223, "211 ZENITH. so proud that she must be sought only on bended knee.

Would he speak to her father for her, or, English fashion, would he woo for him self ? And if so when ? They were to meet to night at a concert at Lady P 's, perhaps for the last time ; for the news from the Villa Bermont were now very bad ; what if she went into mourning, and so they never met again, as in London after that drive home from Richmond, when her heart had first gone out in love to him, and to his English country ? What if they were never to understand each other, but to drift away, having only met to part, like those shepherds of the Russian plains, who, in the national songs, meet, tell each other a little of their history in a wild, plaintive strain, that has no closing chord, and then, as the singers part, never to see each other again, the echo of their complainte dies away over the flat steppes ? There are lives like that, that end without concluding ; and was her life to be like a Scythian shepherd's song?

As she did so she smiled. \"Friend, well-beloved, dearest,\" she murmured to herself, sighing softly between each endearing word, till she w-hispered another name, a nearer and a dearer one \u2014 \" husband ! \" She lisped this slowly in English, like a child trying over her lesson, then, shaking her head, \" What husband ? \" she asked ; \" I shall probably never have one ; \" and then she sighed again, and dropped her head on the broad window-sill, and there, I believe, that like Sarah of old, she laughed. She remained all afternoon in her room, thinking much and long : she did more than think, she prayed. This pure, and noble lady gave thanks to Him who, feeding the ravens when they cry, seemed ready to feed also a hungry human heart, and to give to it, as to the year, and to the fair earth, spring, and new riches, and a new life.

She had tried to do a duty by her father, but he did not really need her ; and only He who made the heart could tell how very lonely hers had been. And now this joy had come to her \u2014 to little Vera \u2014 when royal hearts were breaking, and while steam-horses were bringing the father and the bride to see a prince die whose heritage was the eighth part of the globe.

Prince Michael who had brought an unfavourable bulletin from the Villa Bermont, declined being of the party at Lady P 's, and Vera made her toilette alone, with rather solemn, and nervous thoughts. This evening would probably decide her fate, for she was not likely to go out again, and if the Czarewitch died, there would be an instant scatter of the whole Russian colony in Nice. Then she might return to St. Peters burg, and recommence, after the pompous, melancholy funeral there, the weary round of life in the capital.

Then Vera got up and looked, and the girl who had just been anticipating for herself a premature winter of life stood before her mirror the impersonation of spring.

When Vera and her chaperon of this evening, Princess Kourbsky, entered Lady P 's apartment, there were a number of men collected in the anteroom, in honour of two tables at which cards were being played. In fact, this outer room contained the greater part of the elderly males of the society, who had made good their escape from the music. A select party of its younger members were rather noisy at tea in the cabinet jaune ; but in the large centre salon a perfect silence reigned, because there a French comic song was being sung, or rather performed, by two very stout young men, who"], [230, "218 VERA were twins. One of these thumped a small, upright, and very harsh piano, and looked savagely intent on the chords which he struck with his rather dirty, stumpy fingers. The other, with one of his dirty, stumpy thumbs stuck under his armpit, had contorted a pale and puffy face into a really very comical grin, above which a thin and well-waxed moustache stuck out like the whiskers of a cat. Just as the fair and shapely figure of the young Russian lady appeared in the doorway, and her eyes fell on these performers, there was a more than ordinarily terrific crash made by the pianiste, and then the singing twin broke triumphantly into the refrain of his song : \u2014 Hah ! c'est un bien plaisant animal, ) , .

To the relief of those who did, there succeeded a Pole, who, with hair in admired disorder, executed one of Chopin's weirdest melodies.

Both of them, in feeling and understanding, that this was their last chance of being alone together, perhaps even of meeting, had grudged the hours devoted to, what Lord Kendal called, the fiendish twins ; yet now that they might have talked, there was quite as much silence as speech between them, while Vera sipped her chocolate, and, I fear, let her eyes betray a good deal of the thoughts which had occupied her since they parted last at five o'clock. Countess Zotoff's name was accidentally mentioned, and then Lord Kendal said he feared he had paid her rather an inopportune visit to-day. Vera answered no : but that as Countess Prascovia was a nervous invalid, the weather told much on her spirits."], [232, "220 VERA, \" She does not, as you see, go out with me, and I do not think that she cares much for general society ; perhaps she lost the habit of it during her two long periods of mourning, and she has not here any of her old friends, or habitues, who in Moscow really amuse her. Besides,\" Vera added, with a rather apologetic smile \u2014 \" besides, I think that I ought perhaps to have warned you, that she is very national in all her ideas and feelings ; and I am sure,\" and here the smile faded, and Vera lifted up such pleading eyes ; \u2014 \" I am sure you would more than excuse any want of cordiality towards a \u2014 foreigner, I mean an Englishman \u2014 if you know how much she \u2014 I mean we \u2014 she suffered during the war in the Crimea.\" \" Why should you hesitate to say that tome?\" \" Oh, because \u2014 you too have paid so dearly \u2014 \" and she glanced hesitatingly at his empty sleeve.

He was not wounded with a musket, or by a bayonet-thrust, but must have been shot with a pistol. He was found dead, from cold, and loss of blood. The ball went through the right lung. His mother believes that he was picked out as an officer, and deliberately shot at. It may have been so, for he was tall (taller than I, the last time that we measured), and very fair, and so perhaps easily distinguished, though in the militia the men and the officers wore the same dress \u2014 our national one, with the high boots, and the red sash : and they had the same casquettes \u2014 how do you say it in English \u2014 Kepi ? \u2014 Caps, I suppose ?

So, can you wonder that, whenever my aunt is reminded of that fatal field, her nerves suffer ? You, I am sure, who lost a brother there, will forgive her.\" Vera, expecting after her explanation a kind, and sympathising answer, looked at Lord Kendal, who was just rising from his place on the sofa beside her. He did not answer her, but he leant heavily, with his only hand, on the arm of the sofa. He stooped, and his face, grown curiously grey, and peaked, was bending over her own. Not a word of answer did he give : only looked her in the eyes, with the hungry, steady, all-com prehending gaze of a man who looks his last for this world. \" Good-by,\" at last he said, curtly, and hoarsely. \" Good-by, Vera.\" But that last word died away on his lips, and it never reached her ear. She, mute and drooping, sat statue-like. She saw him bow to her, and saw him leave the room. He left the room, the house, the street, and the town. Striding on like a man who runs from his"], [236, "224 VERA pursuers, Lord Kendal walked on.

Then the vine terraces began, but on he went, looking straight before him, till he reached the top of a hill, and then sitting down, breathless and stunned, he faced the valley and the distant and moonlit sea. And he faced the situation. All the time that he had been walking, the blood had rung and surged so in his ears, that he had seemed to have but a partial sense of the truth. Now he saw it, felt it, and heard it ; and there, for three hours of unbroken silence, and solitude, he saw, felt, and heard nothing else. With what extraordinary irony had life so frequently brought together two people who could never be one ! His hope of personal happiness was gone with Vera ; and, though, maybe, he was too wise and brave a man to suppose that that was the all-in-all, and had lived too long to suppose that he was the only man to whom it had ever happened, still the pang was sharp, and now that she was gone, he felt too strangely, and bitterly forlorn."], [237, "NADIR, 225 He looked round him on the silent olive woods with their grey and whispering shade, and their boles that re call the old classical tale of the King foredoomed by the gods to terrible crimes, and to still more terrible woes.* Had this tragedy really been prepared for him ? seemingly so, for time after time, this Russian girl had been brought to his side, and time after time, she had touched the hand which had taken her cousin's life.

Then there was before him the odious task of in criminating himself in the eyes of the woman he loved, of relating to her not only the odious fact that he had accidentally dealt the death-wound to this young cousin Alexis, but also of trying to make Vera understand why the wishes of the dying boy had never been fulfilled by him.

The hill-side, the raw misty rain, the roar of the conflict, the boy's bright curls, his curious national dress, his blue eyes, his long white hands as he had unfastened the cross from his cap, his frank kindly smile, the little bit of black bread he had offered, his graceful English speech, and his fortitude in the near prospect of death, as the blood burst again and again from his mouth, and choked his few laboured words. Lord Kendal saw it all again, and the sloping valley beneath him here, with its countless trees of peach, and necta rine, and almond, turned into the Crimean ravines, and memory, wakened now from her long trance, rehearsed word for word Count Alexis' message, and the names \u2014 Prascovia Borisovna Zotoff, and Vera Michailovna Zamiatine. The two unlucky crosses were in his dressing-case, now at Maison Jaume : and there was nothing left for him to do now but to enclose them to the Princess, and to say as simply as possible, how they had been given into his hands, and why they had not, ten years ago, found their way to hers."], [239, "227 NADIR.

He must get up, and go home, and write. It really was time to go home ; for the valley, so dark and shadowy when he had plunged into it at midnight, was lightening now with the day, and the blossoms showed as rosy as were the clouds that chased each other out of the east. With a low rustling wind, that first rippled the poplar leaves, then whispered among the resinous pines, and finally died away about the hill-tops in a sigh, the morning had come in. The day was making, and at last, as with a shout, and from above the castle hill that bears the name of Ni'/ctj (victory), the sun shot up victorious ; the birds awoke, butterflies danced among the flowering beans, and countless bees flew past to revel among the cistus, and the lavender, and all the flowering trees. Then the houses seemed to come to life, and here, and there, a faint blue curl of smoke stole up into the air. Mule-bells tinkled, as the peasants came down some steep terraced path on their way to labour ; in the cane-brakes near the oil-mill, some children were singing : and, as Lord Kendal went down the hill to join the roadway, the bells of the church of Sainte Madelaine rang for the early mass. He was chill, weary, stiff, and sick at heart, and he walked slowly, casting in his mind the letter that must be written to Princess Vera ; perhaps, also, there was"], [241, "229 NADIR. an unconscious wish on his part to delay a little the evil hour, and the last step ; for, till that letter was written and read, all was not over ; once it was so, and the simple truth told, he could only leave the place. When he reached the level ground in front of the church, he paused, and, moved by I know not what impulse of piety, curiosity, reluctance, or fatigue, he went in, and stood just inside the porch. An old priest, and the ragged, olive-faced little urchin who served him, were at the altar, with their backs to a congregation of about a dozen peasants. Suddenly the old priest joined his hands, wheeled round on the altar-step, and said in a loud, clear voice, \" Oremus \" \u2014 let us pray. It was well said ; when love and hope are over, honour, life, and duty remain, only, \" Let us pray ! \""], [242, "230 VERA CHAPTER XXIV. BREAKING THE NEWS. Ophelia. I was the more deceived. In spite of a whole night's consideration, that letter was not the less difficult to write, the more so, because, after meeting his family at breakfast, it really seemed to Lord Kendal when he again sat alone, that the whole wretchedness of that night had been a dream, the phan tasmagoria of fever, or a trick of the fancy : anything, in short, but what it was \u2014 an unalterably terrible fate. He would not open his mind on the subject to his sister, he would wait till the play was played out, of which only one act remained to be performed ; but in the meantime, he had announced to her his intention of going for the rest of the week to San Remo, and Men tone, giving as his reason Mrs. St. John's wish to visit those places, and the cessation of all society in Nice,"], [243, "231 EREAKING THE NEWS. owing to the hopeless illness of the Czarewitch. So to Mentone they would go that afternoon ; \u2014 but there was that letter to be written first. Well, he would write it ; and as he would beg Princess Vera not to answer it, and also leave the place, the agony would, at least, be cut short ; \u2014 he could not meet her, and he should be spared any possible anxiety about a reply. He wrote, and I fear that jealousy dictated to him. Perhaps a more curious document never was penned than this letter, for it was as unimpassioned, and as purely historical a narrative, as if it had been written by a third person, and not by the man most interested in that accident on the field of Inkermann, and in its pain ful consequences. He added a short, and very simple account of his brain-fever, and of the many weeks of ship board, and hospital, during which period all memory of the names mentioned by his victim had unluckily escaped from him. He said what a grief this had been to him : so much so, that through all the rewards which his Sove reign had been pleased to bestow on him, the possession of those Russian relics had been to him a real, and a lasting pain. He now restored them to the hands for which they were intended, and he could only hope, rather than expect, that those circumstances would be understood, and forgiven, which had, through too many years, prevented the fulfilment of a dying wish. \" This"], [244, "232 VERA, letter,\" he continued, \"requires no answer; \u2014 it must be, Princess, a painful one for you to receive, and, I fear, that it may be also a troublesome one for you to read.

She heard the door-bell of their apartment ring, and, two minutes after Julie appeared, with a small packet in her hand, which, after one sharp look at her mistress' nervous face, the maid delivered to her, and then left the room. Vera's prophetic spirit told her its contents from the moment she held it in her hands, and all the worst, and most horrible fears of a night so full of horrors were con firmed. She opened the packet, standing by the table, and, at the sight of these tokens from a long-dead man, a sickening faintness took hold of her.

The fate was cruel, but it had been only a chance,\u2014 oh ! that surely had been only a chance which had made her Henry guilty of even a seeming cruelty. But what did he say ? And she sat down to read the letter, smiling a faint ghost of a smile, as she touched the sheet that had come fresh from her lover's hand. She read, and read on, and the blood began to sing in her ears. She turned to the third page \u2014 fever, hospital, regrets : she read all about them there, and her heart beat thicker and louder. Then there was the last page, and when she had read it down to the signature, her heart seemed to stop, and there came a loud whirring noise in her head, and a blank blackness before her eyes, and when Julie, hearing a sound, ran in, she found her young mistress fallen between the table and the bed, and lying, like a snow-wreath, all her fair white length upon the floor. \" Thank you, my good friends,\" said the Princess, when, on recovering consciousness, she found herself lying on the bed, with Julie and Vassilissa beside her \u2014 \" Thank you, I am not worth all the trouble I give. Leave me for a quarter of an hour \u2014 I must be alone ; and then, Julie, beg the Prince, my father, to come to me here.\" Wonderful is the calm of a great nature in the first"], [246, "234 v\u00a3ra, hours of a great shock. The deep soul that can suffer terrible pangs is not the less an impregnable fortress. There is a garrison there that cannot be exhausted ; and attack it where, and when you will, and make what breaches you can in its walls, those breaches are always to be found manned. So was it with the great, and sweet spirit of my Princess. When Michael Zamiatine did what he had not done perhaps more than thrice in his life \u2014 when he came into his daughter's room \u2014 he found Vera still lying on the bed, in her peignoir, with a white Archangel shawl over her feet, deadly pale, but as calm as a seraph. \" Good God ! child, how like your mother you are looking this morning; are you ill that you have sent for me ? \" \" Not ill, my father, but only shaken. This is a very painful matter,\" \u2014 and she handed him the two crosses, and the still open letter. The really indifferent handwriting of the one-armed Englishman obliged Prince Michael to spell out the pages with difficulty, and while he did so, Vera, lying motionless, dropped through her fingers some beads of her rosary. The poor child was trying to steady herself by prayer, as she had often seen her mother do, for, in the extremes of bodily anguish, Anna Feodorovna would often do this, saying, \" God, my child, likes to hear our"], [247, "BREAKING THE NEWS. 235 love, and not our cries.\" But Vera soon found that her thoughts slipped away, as the deadly faintness crept over her again, and then, unable to form any longer petition, she murmured only, \" Slava tiebe Gospodi ! \" (Glory to God !) Like a martyr of old, she sang praise in her agony to Him who, in unerring wisdom, permits the temporary suffering of His children. But nature will have her way, and at last she could only moan out, \"Ach ti Gospodi!\" (Oh, Lord!), and then burst into a passion of weeping. \" What did you say, my child ? \" \" Xitchevo,\" (nothing), she answered, and hiding her face now in the pillows, she wept on. Prince Michael had read with frowning brows, and now that he had read all, he walked once or twice up and down the room. Man though he was, he saw and had seen for some time how the wind set, and he had thoroughly approved of Vera's choice, while he perhaps was also anxious to see her married before he brought a second wife to the house. But here was a terrible break-up. And here, two rooms off, and talking of her aches, and her ails to Doctor Prosch, was Countess Zotoff, ready to go off in a fury about her son, and also ready, as he well knew, to accept of a hand which he had very nearly offered her twenty-nine years before. But even if, putting Countess"], [248, "236 VERA Zotoff's feelings out of the question, Vera might have been found willing to forget this disastrous accident of ten years ago, and to marry the Englishman, his was not a lover's letter \u2014 not a word did those four pages con tain about Lord Kendal's own feeling for Vera, if he had any. He seemed to take it for granted that here all intimacy was to cease between himself and the Zamiatine family, and in assuming this he had not subjoined one word of comment. Had he ever cared for Vera ? \u2014 so her father asked himself, or had it been all a delusion \u2014 philandering, and habit, and courtesy, and cour de salon, and no courtship intended at any time ? Vera, at any rate, seemed to think so now, for she was weeping as if her heart would break, and Prince Michael, who hated the sight of tears, only wished that he knew of anything to do for her. \"Will you tell Aunt Pascha,\" said Vera feebly, and then Prince Michael, who was not great in resource, felt that this had been the thing he had all along wished to do for his daughter, and so, gathering up the relics and the letter, he forthwith betook himself to Countess Zotoff's rooms, to break the unpleasant news to her. No need to describe the blundering but well-meaning periphrases which he employed for that purpose. They were not of much use, nor were they long required, for no sooner was Countess Pascha put on the scent than"], [249, "237 BREAKING THE NEWS. her mind darted on the truth, and springing to her feet, she screamed with rage and sorrow. \" My Alexis ! my golden child ! my only son ! oh, that butcher, that murderer ! and he has sat in this house, and there is no one who will kill him for me!\" Her elderly adorer, showed, I must confess, no symptoms of blood thirstiness at the moment. \" Aleoshinka ! ach Aleoshinka moj ; ach ti dusha moja ! (Oh thou soul of mine !) Ach Aleoshinka ! \" and in strong hysterics, Countess Pascha had to be handed over to the care of her two handmaids. With what appetite the master of that house sat down to breakfast may be supposed. He had Vera weeping in one room, Countess Zotoff shrieking in another, and the maids, it must be added, quarrelling in a third ; for no sooner had Marussia on the one hand, and Julie on the other, been put in possession of the sad facts, than the long-smothered animosity between these two servants broke out. Marussia, bigot of bigots, would gladly have burned, not only the English mis believer, but also the Princess who was so unnatural as to love a foreigner, the man who had killed her Alexei Dimitrivitch.

So to this eloquent appeal of Marussia's she only replied by wiping away with her apron tears that might have been supposed to be shed upon both or either sides of the question ; and then, having finished ironing a petticoat, she withdrew, leaving the angry disputants to fight it out between them, which, indeed, they were well able to do, having always a large stock of vituperatives at their disposal\u2014 in several lan guages. Most silent, and most unhappy through that day, and through all following days, was Princess Vera ; for that Lord Kendal did not love her, and that he had never loved her, had become, since the reading of his letter, her fixed idea ; and, like Ophelia, she felt that she had been \" the more deceived.\" Her father, though generally busy in or about the Villa Bermont, did manage to answer Lord Kendal's letter ; that is to say, he wrote, in his stiff, crabbed"], [253, "241 BREAKING THE NEWS. hand, and somewhere about the middle of a square sheet of paper (which must therefore have looked un commonly like a lettre pour faire part) as follows : \u2014 \" The Princess Vera Michailovna Zamiatine begs to thank Lord Kendal for a packet which reached her to-day, the 20th of April, 1865.\" That was all, and Lord Kendal found it on the follow ing Monday, when Mrs. St. John, tired of the ruralities of Mentone, brought him reluctantly back to Nice. He was most unwilling to return to the town, but once there, he was seized with the most devouring wish, the most insane desire, to see Vera again. One way of doing so alone offered itself. The poor Czarewitch, who had died on Sunday, would lie in state on one day of this week : there would be a function, and there he would take his chance, even if he had to wait half the day for it, of seeing the Princess again. Of this determination, and of his presence in Nice, Vera knew nothing. To her all was over. Yes, when the Scythian shepherds cease their singing on the wide steppes, not an echo even of their song remains. She had thought of that before, and so it was now.

Yet there were few earthly things he would not that morning have forfeited rather than this his last and only chance of seeing the Princess. He was not naturally a sanguine man, and he probably had formed no hopes or expectations from such a meeting; it was only hunger which drove him there \u2014 hunger for her face, her voice, and her sweet presence : it was curiosity to know if she was well, or if she had been suffering : it was that longing for completeness, even in things bitter and mournful, which can give a soothing power to many a sad sight, to the disappearing sail, nay, even to those last rites \" when the feet of the bearers are heavy and slow ; \" for to have seen the last is always to be en feoffed in something. It is something not to have been baulked ; it is a possession for ever. Lord Kendal was also actuated by self-reproach. He had come to own to himself now, that but for his insane jealousy of the dead Alexis, that letter would have been, not more courteous, for in that, being the work of an English gentleman, it had certainly not been lacking but more concerned. It would have preserved more the tone of an old friend, who, innocently guilty as he might be, still had the right, by reason of old friendship, to feel, and to express a deep personal loss, and regret. Now that it was too late, or all but too late for reparation in this world, he blamed himself for his jealousy, and his"], [256, "244 VERA, pride. Like many more, he found reason to curse that false humility which pretends to sink itself, only that it may more effectually wound another : which denies to the heart, however full and sore, one tender, humane, or reasonable expression of worthy feeling, which, self deceiving, is content with the bare letter of right doing, and, by missing the large, and great spirit of the Right, leaves itself for ever utterly, selfishly, and inhumanly in the wrong. Self-accused, and of just such a temper was Lord Kendal to-day, as he carried his uneasy conscience along with him to the church in the Longchamps. That man must however be a very selfish one who does not feel before the spectacle of a nation's sorrow and a father's loss, that his own griefs, whatever be their magnitude, are, in a measure, dwarfed, if not absolutely for the time being appeased. At least, so Lord Kendal found, when he began to mingle with the curious crowd that poured into the Russian church, during the early hours of the lying-in-state of the Czarewitch. The appearance of the building itself was, in some degree, a surprise to him ; for, glittering in the light of the myriad tapers with which this \" chapelle ardente \" was filled, rose the iconostas, or screen, from which the sacred pictures looked down upon the crowd, their"], [257, "245 THE LYING IN STATE. long, lean, brown hands, and their saintly, Byzantine faces looking still more unearthly, and more passion less from the great stiff, gilt plates that surround them. The golden gates were closed, and across the sanctuary within them, the seamless, red silk curtain hung \u2014 fit emblem to-day, not only of any sacramental mysteries it might hide, but of that red veil of our humanity which hangs ever before the true Holy of Holies, and which hides from mortal senses the secrets, and the ineffable beauties of the glory that is to be revealed. By the dead this veil is lifted, to them the great Earth-mother, the inviolate Isis, with her triple secret of life, death, and resurrection, stands revealed. The curtain hangs ever between her and the living. Round the dome of this church, and in old Sclavonic lettering, runs the pathetic legend, \" Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy-laden, and I will refresh you ! \" and Lord Kendal realised, as he read it, that if rites vary with clime and custom, grief is one and the same, and that one also is the hope of the human family through the Great, and the Silent Consoler. Those who had come with their first-born to that church for the promised solace there, were among the veriest potentates of the earth, the powers of the great North. Last night, by torchlight, the family of the Czarewitch had brought him thither on foot : father,"], [258, "246 VERA, mother, brothers, sister, \" kinsfolk, and acquaintance,\" \u2014 they had come to render him the pathetic observance of the last kiss, and to touch his brow and his hand in an unutterably tender farewell. And then, having declared with their royal lips that before the last Judge all men are equal,* they had wended their way back with flambeaux to his empty rooms. To-day round his catafalque all the noblest houses in Russia were represented \u2014 boyars, in whose veins still runs the Warangian blood of Rurik the Northman, were there, soldiers from the Caucasus, and generals of Crimean fame, and, among the great historic names of the day, only one was missing \u2014 Nicholas Orloff \u2014 who had been carried feet foremost to the graveyard on the Castle hill but ten days before. Then came the authorities, and dignitaries of the town, its clergy, the general commanding in the district, and his staff, all the \" cast-iron colonels with the cast iron faces,\" then the Colonel, the officers, and many of the men of the Regiment of the Chasseurs-ii-pied de la Garde Imperiale : and then the crews of three Russian frigates, marines in their ugly uniform, and sailors with fair hair, and high cheek-bones, who had had their flat, sallow * \" For I go before the Judge with whom is no respect of persons: for serf and lord stand together before Him ; king and warrior, rich and poor, in one estimation.\"\u2014 Stichera of the Last Kiss, ascribed to S.

There were French sailors also, with their long, falling, blue collars, and glazed hats ; English, and Nizzard residents ; peasants from the environs, and even from the neighbouring hills ; and Russian servants in .the national dress, whether they were nurses with crimson sarafans, big amber necklaces, and high glitter ing Kakoshniksf or were Lithuanian girls, with long plaits of fair hair. These all worshipped on their faces with piteous sobs of \"Ach ti Gospodi!\" breaking at times from their breasts, while children looked on, timidly crossing themselves at intervals, and gazing with inno cent curiosity at all this pageantry of death. Lastly, there was a crowd of Russian ladies, who, in the pure white dresses of the Easter season, looked like a stream of milk among the dark crowd of soldiers, sailors, and officials, whose breasts blazed with the crosses, and stars of half-a-dozen orders. The dead Czarewitch was likewise in full uniform, and his orders were displayed on his breast, while above them his hands were crossed in that supreme repose which a national proverb says is only- to be secured by death. f The catafalque was a mass of flowers, for Nice the * High, crescent-shaped head-dress worn by Russian peasant women. f Two hands crossed on breast ; Labour is done.

Every few hours fresh baskets of flowers arrived, and every fresh shower of them, as they fell upon the bier, seemed to be more exquisite, more fragrant, more mockingly gorgeous than the last. The \" poet-gardener \" of Nice had outdone himself, it was declared, and had even surpassed the flowers which he had sent on a recent evening, when, in their Holy WTeek, Russia's Empress had knelt by the \" Cercueil de Jesus,\" and had dropped upon the holy Bier, roses that looked like molten gold. Dead among the roses now lay the dead Heir of all the Russias, and at the foot of the catafalque were the readers, who, by relieving each other constantly, kept up through all the hours of day and night, the reading of those Gospel narratives which the Russian Church has appropriated to the cold ear of royalty in death.* The heat of the church, the smell of the incense, and of the flowers, and the pressure of this great and varied * It is the Psalms which are read beside the dead bodies of all except of the royal family : for them the Gospels arc reserved."], [261, "249 THE LYING IN STATE. crowd affected Lord Kendal very painfully after the first half-hour of his stay, and the monotonous modula tions of the readers' voices seemed to inflict a positive physical pain, and to aggravate the gnawing neuralgia in the stump of his left arm, which was rampant to day as it had been ever since the sirocco set in ; \u2014 his impatience too increased gradually as his hope of seeing Princess Vera seemed to be dwindling away. It was hardly possible that she could have come and gone before he reached the church, and now midday, and the midday heats were approaching, and it was more than unlikely that during the next four hours she would appear. On the other hand, four hours more of this dismally superb function were not to be thought of : and even had he contemplated for himself four hours more of this stifling atmosphere of mixed flowers, and incense, and candle smoke, (not to speak of a mass of humanity), it would not have been permitted. In the interest of the public a general order \" to move ou\" would be enforced, unless indeed the crowd should happen to diminish considerably during the siesta hours of the day. Of that as yet it had showed no signs, though the midday bells of Nice were already clanging, making themselves audible above the droning of the readers, and discoursing with their metal tongues of the lapse of time, above the head of one whose lease of time was more than run. Still the"], [262, "250 VERA, crowd came and went, and went and came, pressing up and down the steps which lead up to the church ; for every Russian church is raised above the level of the ground, and represents, with its carpeted floor, the \" upper room furnished \" of the first Paschal supper. Lord Kendal waited and waited, and finally he gave up all hope, for the sun did seem at last to have begun to frighten away pilgrims from this flowery shrine ; and as ten minutes had elapsed since any new comers had appeared, he gave it up, and was just turning to leave the church when above a group of heads at the door, he descried the well-known white moustache of Prince Michael Zamiatine, and behind him, the Princess Vera. But what a V^ra ! Dressed in white from head to foot, and holding over one arm a wreath of the white Clematis montana, she was not only, if possible, more colourless than was her dress, but she was altered almost beyond recognition. Certainly she was altered beyond imme diate recognition of any one who might have seen her face last, tremulous with eagerness, interest, and hope. It looked more deplorable from the whiteness of her crape bonnet, and its contrast with the mass of yellow hair which lay above the forehead, where the large blue veins were painfully distinct. Her eyes were heavy, and yet so deepened were their sockets that they seemed to have grown beyond all measure great, and below their under-"], [263, "THE LYING IN STATE. 251 lids there were large violet stains : her lips looked dry, and as they were parted, this along with the strange expression of her eyes, gave her all the appearance of a person who, after a severe shock, has been stricken with some mental infirmity. With vacuous, impersonal look, and with tottering, unsteady gait, he beheld this beautiful girl transformed into an Ophelia. She followed her father mechanically through the crowd till she reached the foot of the coffin, where she laid her wreath on the ground, and then bowed herself before the dead majesty of Russia, until her forehead also nearly touched the floor. She then raised herself, and with the same stupid, wide-open eyes moved on a step or two, making the sign of the cross as she went. Lord Kendal fairly groaned, and for a moment he felt dizzy, partly owing to the stifling air, partly to the pang of this sudden apparition of the woman whom he loved, and who now came before him, no longer beautiful and serene, but as a stricken, statue-like creature, who must have gone through something worse than the shadow of death since he had seen her last. And all this through his fault or misfortune ! All this was from grief for the dead Alexis, for the fair young soldier, her companion, killed ten years ago at Inkermann, and who had, it seemed, taken her young love along with him to his soldier's grave, and so made, as she had said that"], [264, "252 VEPA. day about Princess Dagmar's betrothed, the day dark before it had ever fairly dawned. Vera, the most tender and faithful of northern women, still wept, as he believed, for her Alexis, and looking at to-day's spectacle through her own old grief, she was ready, so Lord Kendal thought, to weep for her own old loss beside the clay cold corpse of the Czarewitch. Some associations really- did seem at work in the girl. Lord Kendal could see her as she now approached the side of the bier, and laying her left hand on it, she stood for a moment, and looked steadily- at the corpse. From association then, or from pure pity, a rush of tenderness seemed to come over her, and she dropped on one knee, and with something like a sob she bent down ere she kissed him, and gazed with clasped hands at the man who a week ago had been her future sove reign, and who, not so very many months ago, had often given her his royal hand in the dance. The \" rapture of repose \" spread over the noble Romanof brows, and the bewildering beauty of the bright flowers heaped up about his pillow, both seemed to fascinate her. She gazed, and gazed, as if she would fain have had more time to realise what death is, and what may be the height or the depth of that last sleep ; then after she had kissed him, the tears began slowly to course down her cheeks, to which a more living colour had, by this time, returned."], [265, "THE LYING IN STATE. 253 Yet though this emotion had had power to wake her out of the semi-vacant trance in which she had at first moved about, the face now, as seen by her lover, was all quivering and tear-bedewed, and was, if possible, a more piteous sight thau before. By as much more piteous, had Lord Kendal but known it, as does the anguish of a living sorrow surpass the solemn grief of a greater loss by death. He did not read its meaning aright : but he had seen enough, far more than enough for one day, and so he turned, and left the church, while the Princess was still worshipping, her face towards the golden gates, and her mouth moving in some unguessed-at prayer. Out side, where the sunshine smote down upon him almost like a sword, the fields of Longchamps lay in verdure. In their lanes the young green reed-canes were pushing sharp, and strong, and striking quickly down one of these lanes, he soon reached the shadow, and shelter of the streets, and then through the mules, and the dust, and all the traffic of the Rue de France, he made his way out to his sister's house. Princess Vera too went home. She had not seen Lord- Kendal in church, where perhaps, had she met them, his sympathetic eyes might have revealed to her the truth it so very much imported her to know : but she did not know it, and lying down as soon as she got"], [266, "254 VERA, home, she lay unsleeping, and silent, through six com fortless hours.

Clarigel. Every day of that sad week in Nice which brought such a burden of sorrow to Vera Michailovna, had also its appointed interest and ceremonial, and this was un avoidable until the last offices had been rendered to the dead Czarewitch, and that he and his had all vanished from the place, like a dream when the sleeper awakes. All Friday, till sundow-n, the body had lain ill the church, and at sunset an immense cavalcade collected \u2014 the Czar, and his sons, on horseback, with every official of the town and department, with the Bishop, and the clergy of all the churches, with the court and its retinue, with troops, and with such a concourse of spectators, that these blackened every road, rock, wall, parapet, and"], [268, "256 VERA, window, and every- coign of vantage from which the embarcation at Villa Franche could be seen. If grief was expressed in some black dresses, in the reversed yards of the frigates, and in the flags that floated half-mast high, as well as in the booming of the minute-guns that woke a hundred echoes in the rocks, all inanimate nature looked that evening not only glad, but glorious. Round the feet of those red rocks lapped the most pellucid of waves, above their heads was the most unclouded ether, on their sides rested the misty grey olive woods ; gardens of lemon and orange scented the evening air, and the undergrowth there was a carpet of the brightest dyes, for the weeds of that happy region are as superb as are the garden flowers of ours. The fields were streaked with red spear lilies, hedged with roses, and hung with garlands of bindweed, and by every roadside there grew great beds of blue borage, starred with Bethlehem flowers,* or pierced by the lilies of St. Bruno, whose stems looked like rods of silver. Here and there a tall and sky-pointing cypress rose above the caroubas and the maritime pines ; and far to the eastward, beyond the promontory of St. Jean, where the tunny boats lay, and Eza's more exquisite sea, stretched the bold outlines of the hills, and the purple * Ornithogalum : called by the peasants \" la dame d'onze heures,\" from the time of its opening."], [269, "257 PONT DES PAS PERDUS. Bordighiera shore. But here, close at hand, and under the walls of the Darse, or inner dock, the crowd of human beings was greatest, and there the black barges lay, waiting for their precious freight. Again the guns boomed, and the bells of the little town, just done their ringing to even song, began to toll, while the band of the flag-ship sent across the waters wailing notes of most melodious pain. Then the barges pushed off. In the first, o'er-canopied with gold, the royal coffin lay, and before it, and behind it were the priests, who still with psalms and prayers escorted it to the frigate. The great hull of the Alex ander Nevsky, her black sides, her ninety guns, and her towering top-gallants, which, like those of her sister frigate the Vitias, had been for some months familiar to all eyes, now mirrored themselves for the last time in these waters, for soon, with a great streamer of black smoke, waving like a mourning banner behind them, they were standing out between the headlands, and just where, in the brief twilight, the lines of sea and sky seemed melted into one, they took their flight. The pallid melancholy Bay of Cronstadt awaited them, and this the harbour of the southern sea saw them no more for ever. Vera two hours later could still, from her window, descry the ships far out on the western horizon ; the moon shone already in their wake, and in their sails 17"], [270, "258 VERA, was the vent de souleii, a light but a favouring breeze. On Saturday the court left for Stuttgard, and then in every Russian house there was a general sauve qui pent; everyone, nobles as well as officials, more anxious the one than the other to leave the place, and to reach St. Petersburg, so as to assist in due form at the real funeral of the dead Heritier. The Zamiatines were naturally not remiss, and a day had been fixed for their leaving, when a contretemps occurred in the dangerous illness of Marussia, the old Russian maid. Prince Michael gallantiy offered to wait for three days, so as, if possible, not to oblige Countess Zotoff to travel alone ; and it may be believed that this attention on his part was in every way acceptable, and held it to be very symptomatic. It was almost a reprieve to Vera when Julie rushed into her room to announce \u2014 upon the courier's autho rity \u2014 that the journey was delayed for three days. Though all hope was at an end, still she dreaded the hour that was to tear her from the south \u2014 the land her mother had loved, the place where she had known so much happiness.

Then here, at least, \" Nature was ambassador for God.\" * But yonder lay the north, with leaden skies, and wild wailing winds, as of a soul in pain ; there was the formal life, the death in life, which she so much dreaded. Every verst that lay between herself and the north had its value now \u2014 by so much further off was her father's marriage, and her own very probable retreat to the Novi Devitchi Convent. She resigned herself therefore very philosophically to the inconvenient delay ; but not so her maid. Mademoiselle Julie made a personal matter of the occurrence, and of the notice bestowed on the sick woman. \" Sick ? I believe it, and what wonder ? The antics she has played for the last three weeks would have undermined the constitution of an anthrophagc.

Yes, I repeat it, and she may say as she will, but I missed those boxes on the Vigil of the Sunday of the Palm branches, and I know that she took them, to burn before the holy pictures, forsooth ! Ah sale tripotage ! (nasty messing !) she is always at it. So between that week, and her tempers about the Countess' son that was killed, and her howlings over the Heritier (God give rest to his good soul !) this illness has come on us. And what a fuss ! \u2014 ' How is she ? ' all day long. And who asks how I am ? I who have to pack for two people, and in this heat of the lizards ; \u2014 or my young mistress either? does she look well ? Bien loin, very far from it.\" Neither, Julie might have added, did Countess Zotoff look well. She was seriously vexed by her maid's illness \u2014 a bilious fever, undeniably produced by the very causes which Mademoiselle Julie had so ably described, but not the less troublesome. Then Dr. Prosch's bill for a winter's attendance on herself"], [273, "PONT DES PAS PERDUS. 261 had to be paid, and, in spite of that worthy person's fair prophecies, and fine speeches, his little bill on leave taking, made a sad hole in the widow's purse. In short, the poor lady's temper was tried, and what weighed on her mind most of all, was the fact that she was taking Vera back to Russia unaffianced, and plainly out of spirits. Never, she said to herself, had there been anything more unlucky than her fancy for that Englishman. Serge Donskoi was certainly dismissed, and not another suitor was in the field, and so convinced was Countess Pascha that Prince Michael would not give his daughter a stepmother as long as she remained unmarried, that, at the end of ten days, it must be said that the Countess found it far easier to forgive Lord Kendal the accidental death of her son, than his not having, long ere this, married Princess Vera. That young lady lay, as may be supposed, on anything but a bed of roses, and nothing but the Countess' wish to stand well with her father had protected her from many such outbreaks as had greeted her when she had glided on that first day into Aunt Pascha's room. Anxious to make her peace after the fatal discovery, and moved by pity for the childless woman, she had crept up to the side of her bed. Then Prascovia Borisovna had sprung up, and clenched her fist, and with eyes gleaming"], [274, "262 VERA, like fires, had cried, \" How dare you \u2014 how did you dare to bring that man into this house ? You viper ! to love the murderer of my son under his wretched mother's eyes ! \" \" I did not know it,\" Vera had sobbed \u2014 \" I could not know it ! \u2014 how could I have known it? Would to God that I had known it ! \" And, covering her face with her hands, she had sunk into a chair. After that day the subject had not been definitively alluded to between them. At length Marussia's symptoms abated, and the following day was fixed for their departure from Nice \u2014 dusty, deserted Nice, which nobody now regretted but Vera. She was sitting alone at the window on the last evening of their stay, when Countess Zotoff entered with a broken sun -umbrella in her hand. \" Could Julie be prevailed on,\" she asked, \"to go to the shop at the corner of the Pont Neuf, and get her another? Vas silissa was helping poor Marussia to rise. It was now half-past seven ; the shop would soon be shut. To morrow there would not be time to go for a parasol, and the sun would kill her \u2014 the sirocco was bad enough already.\" Vera rose to call her maid, but returned almost immediately with her little sailor's hat in her hand."], [275, "PONT DES PAS PERDTJS. 263 \" Julie is out,\" she said ; \" but if you like, Aunt Pascha, I will walk there now, and get a parasol for you. It is not hot now, and people are all at dinner, or already out of town, and I can go alone.\" \" Do, for the sake of charity ! \" And Vera, without further delay, tied on her hat, threw a piece of black gauze over her shoulders, and sallied forth to execute her commission. An eight minutes' walk brought her to the place, and the evening air was pleasant and cool, even on the heated quays. Having paid for her purchase, Vera was prepared, Nice fashion, to carry- it home with her, and parasol in hand she mounted the steps of the bridge. She had but begun to cross it when her heart gave a sudden leap. There, about six yards before her, and on the same side with herself, though coming in a different direction, walked Lord Kendal. She could not pretend not to recognize him, since there was but one one-armed man in Nice ; she could not expect not to be recognized, since, whether she knew it or not, there was no other such blonde beauty in the place, and she could not avoid meeting him, for there was no crowd in which they might pass each other unobserved. The hour was late \u2014 past half-past seven \u2014 and the sole occupants of the roadway were three mules, two of whom had long flat"], [276, "264 VERA. oil-barrels fastened to their pack-saddles, and abundance of red, and white worsted netting about their ears ; on the third mule was a sack, and on the top of the sack was an old woman, and on the top of the old woman was her wide capeline. All this Vera saw at a glance, and saw that these offered her no shelter. Behind her were two soldiers carrying their rations in small tin cans : they too, stepping off the pavement, soon passed her, and there was nothing left but some washerwomen, with gauze-covered baskets of linen, and a half-dozen of bourgeois, and bonnes : and even these were on the other side. Meantime her former friend was now close to her. When he saw that they must meet, Lord Kendal took up his position with great strategical skill. He moved aside as if to let her pass, and then standing in the gutter, he raised his hat. He had his back to the light. Not so poor Vera. It is true that the parapet had been left to her, and that she could lean her hand on it for support, but the light of the setting sun fell full upon her, flooding her black dress, her throat, her string of pearls, and her golden hair, and showing all the sudden changes of her face, from red to ashy pale. She felt blinded too by the light, and her limbs trembled ; but she was perfectly collected, perfectly gentle, and perfectly still. If she was an accusing angel she was"], [277, "265 PONT DES PAS PERDUS. a silent one. Lord Kendal stammered out that he had believed she had left Nice by this time. She answered in French that they had been delayed by the illness of a servant. This heat was very trying to travel in but they hoped to move to-morrow. In reply he said something not very intelligible, about their finding the weather cooler as they got further north, and Vera, as he said it, paled so, that you might have thought she had suddenly seen an iceberg approaching. Lord Kendal then lifted his hat to her again, when her lips moved as if she was about to speak. He paused, and she suddenly held out her hand, and said, with the sweetest and most heartfelt expression in the world, but still in French, \" Croyez-moi, je vous ai beaucoup plaint. * Adieu.\" She had turned now, had absolutely- passed on before he could say anything in reply but, \" Thank you.\" And there he stood rooted to the spot, staring blankly at the parapet, at the white dusty torrent- bed beneath, and at the red evening glow on Mont Boron. \" God bless you,\" at last he exclaimed, \" God bless you, my Vera, my darling, and my princess ; my beloved ! \" he continued to himself, as he recalled the sweet earnest face, the loyal, lovely eyes, the golden glory of her hanging hair, the slender, exquisite figure, the pathetic voice, and the heartfelt, gracious words, so * \" Believe me, I have pitied you extremely.\""], [278, "266 VERA. full of thought for others rather than for herself. This girl was wise then to divine that he must have suffered much who had innocently wrought a wrong to her and hers, and she was also brave to speak out her thoughts, while he, part coward and part cretin, had stood there stammering and helpless. And a stiff English \" Thank you \" was all she had got in return. Certainly theirs had been from first to last a most unlucky chapter of accidents and of misunderstandings ; and as Lord Kendal walked on, he pondered over the whole history, from their first meeting on board the Leghorn boat to this last moment, so full of pain, and yet not without its bitter sweetness ; for if he was cer tainly an unlucky fellow, who had contrived to do every thing he should not, and to lose the one thing in the world that he most longed for, yet she w-as left on her fair pinnacle of eminence, a spotless, gentle creature, full of patience and of fidelity \u2014 well named Vera, for she was always \" faithful found.\" * The said Vera was in the meantime making her way home.

Her knees shook, she barely felt the ground on which she walked, and so was nearly knocked over on the quay, and when she did get home * rtpa, Vera, Faith."], [279, "267 PONT DES PAS PERDUS. she was shivering as if with ague. She sat down, and asked faintly for some tea. \" What is the matter ? \" cried Countess Zotoff. \" It is perhaps the sun which has struck me to-day ; I am sick, and so cold.\" \" Cold, child, in this pernicious sirocco ! I only wish I had the same complaint. Doctor Prosch assures me that if this weather lasts, the effects of the journey on me may be most serious. But who is to get you tea at this hour? Call Vassilissa; she may be to be found. Julie never is,\" continued Countess Pascha, crossly. Vassilissa fortunately was on the premises, and soon set tea before Vera, who swallowed it with difficulty7, but hoped as she did so, that it would stop the chattering of her teeth, and the shaking of her hands. \" I quite dread this journey,\" began the elder lady after a pause ; \" and yet I shall be glad to be out of Nice. I am sure I never thought,\" she continued, plaintively, \" that the winter would have ended as it has done.\" \" Has it disappointed you also ? \" \" Why, look at my health, child.

That misfortune relates in part to my late cousin Alexei Dimitrivitch, and I beg, as a favour to myself, that you will not again give me the annoy-ance of hearing Lord Kendal's name. He does not obtrude it on me, and I must request that you will not; and,\" she continued, with one of those smiles which Countess Zotoff thought satirical, \" if you consider me as a girl little likely to make conquests, consider me also for this evening as one who has many packages to make. I wish you good night ; \" and Vera walked away. \" Just so ! I never can hold my own with that child.

A pupil of Madame Swetchine's, she called herself! What was Madame Swetchine, after all? \u2014 a woman with a dropsy, half pietiste, half Frenchwoman \u2014 one of a dozen* to my thinking. Well, he must needs marry this pupil of Madame Swetchine, and a great deal of good that did him at court, too. And then I married Dimitri (the kingdom of Heaven be his !) ; but that is no reason, of course, why I should not make it up with an old friend now, especially when my poor dear Aleoshinka is dead, and I have no one to care for me.

In the object which had induced her to abandon holy- Russia, and her mother Moscow, for Nice, she saw herself foiled ; and, in her own mind, she declared Princess Vera to be a colossus of ingratitude.

And then she had worked all winter on the man in whose house she lived, slowly, patiently, and complacently ; while she had appeared to be absorbed in her health, she had not been the less working, turning the current of the flame always on the wire, in the belief that when once red-hot it would bend to her wish : regulating the clock, and then watching the hands, for when they came to the hour what could they do but strike ?

She opened it to let the air in on her beating temples. There was that mute beautiful face of the outside world, apparently the only unaltered thing, now almost painfully still and fair, in its twilight loveliness, and yet, had she been but calm enough to read it, glorious as the dumb counte nance of God, and telling of His abiding Faithfulness. She stretched out her hands as one who at once mourns and pleads. Helpless and alone, she looked round the room. Everything had been packed except the picture, and the book that always lay beside her bed. This picture, the one with which her mother had been blessed when she married, was one of Vera's chief treasures, and, from out of its stiff gold plates, the mild face of the Christ seemed now to look tenderly, and yet reprovingly, on her despairing passion. In the book \u2014 The Imitation \u2014 were also words of power to soothe her. She undressed, lay down, and, taking up the volume, opened it \"by chance ; \" but, as chance would have it, at these verses : \u2014 \" Oh ! righteous Father, and ever to be praised, the hour is come that Thy servant is to be proved . . .

Trust in Me, and put thy confidence in My Mercy.\" Yes ! the whole world of her love and beliefs might crumble away, but this remained true : and, with such words, she stilled her throbbing pulses, com posing herself, if not to sleep, at least to calmness. The journey of the next day would have been a trying one to persons in the best of health and circumstances, for the heat was intense, and the only moment of relief that the travellers obtained was when leaving Cannes with its beach and its villas behind, the train plunged into the purple gorges of the Esterelles. But hot as had been the morning, it was nothing to what the temperature became in the afternoon under the white cliffs of Toulon. Vera was very wretched. All the pathos and excite ment of yesterday had faded, and to them had succeeded a desolation of weariness, and a weariness of desolation, that made her well nigh \" a-weary o' the sun.\" Her frame of mind towards Lord Kendal was now that of displeasure. She saw that he must have trifled with her; and what she now felt was less anger than a grave,"], [288, "276 VERA, settled condemnation of him.

Oh, this Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin of the affections ! Anything but this we cry \u2014 resenting it as the edges of a wound resent the cautery that will make it ultimately heal.

Unable to sit up or eat, she was put to bed, where she slept little, or not at all ; and by morning she had so much fever that a doctor was called in, and Prince Michael's northward journey had to be again unavoid ably delayed. Her own physician, when summoned from Nice, looked very grave, and said that hers was a severe nervous crisis, with cataleptic symptoms, and recom mended great quiet.

By the end of the seventh day there was some amendment, and it was thought that the Princess might move without risk. Her doctor came to her early next morning, and told her that, in his opinion, they would do well to take the evening train, and to go as far as Avignon at once. \" Travel only after the sun has lost its power,\" he said. \"I think it would be well to avoid Paris altogether, and when you get as far as Berne, the air of the mountains will revive you.\" Vera murmured some reply, and then turned away her face to hide the tears of weakness that were now running down it. \" Figlia mia,\" said the kind physician abruptly, as he drew his chair opposite her, and laid his hand on her thin arm, \" I hope that you do not expect to die ; because you are not dying, or even going to die.

They were hooked on to the train that came in from Toulon, and soon, passing beyond the suburbs of Marseilles, the travellers found their faces really turned towards the north. The evening air blow ing from the salt lagoons and lakes, which there run so far inland, soon roused the Princess, who, to pass away the time of remaining daylight, began to amuse herself with turning over the pages of Mireio. It is a Provencal book, about the Provencal country, about these very salt-lakes, about the mulberry farms, the pines, the rocks, the lavender, the cistus, the solitudes, and the flamingo flights of the plain of Crau, on which our travellers entered just as the moon rose. Seen at night, this wide and stony plain seemed to Vera motionless as her own northern snows, and not less inimitably vast. Vera closed her book just where- Mireio, in her lovelorn flight across the Crau, gets the sunstroke of which she dies in Vincent's arms."], [291, "THE JOURNEY NORTHWARD. 279 \" Happy Mireio ! \" she thought ; \" and happy death !

Better, nay best, would it be to go away, and be at rest, to have for home the plains of heaven, and for company the quire of angels, and the ' three shining Maries,' whom Mireio in her delirium saw. It would be sweet to feel earth fading, heaven nearing, and her own mother's arms opening to receive her. There would be her twin Simony, grown tall and fair : and Alexis all radiant ; and her Henry too, blameless among the blameless ones. ' Oh, God ! how beautiful are Thy tabernacles ! ' \" and Vera repeated over to herself this song of her Church militant, and then lay back, dreaming with half-closed eyes, while the train sped on, until she fancied heaven near, \u2014 all impressions grew faint, bodily weakness she felt no more, but in the soft summer moonlight she was lapped in a dreamless rest.

Morris. Crash ! She was awakened by a crash, a loud report, and a violent shake ; the carriage first vibrated wildly, and then swung over, till with a roll, and another crash, it settled on its side on the ground. Vera heard the first report, and one piercing shriek from Countess Zotoff, and then becoming insensible she saw or felt nothing more. Slowly only was order restored after the first horrible disorder of that accident. Something, Prince Michael was told, had burst or broken about the engine : the train had been brought up with a terrible jerk, the engine had bedded itself in the ground, a tender and one carriage were"], [293, "AT LAST, 281 on top of it, something then took fire, steam escaped, and the last carriage of the train, that in which the Zamiatines were, coming uncoupled by the shock, had turned on its side, and then rolled down the embankment. The earth work was not, at that spot, above two, or at the most three, feet in height, but such as the overturn had been, it made it a matter of no little difficulty for Prince Michael, once he was himself free, to extricate his unconscious daughter, and the highly conscious, and shrieking Countess Pras covia. Of these ladies, the first, though senseless, was to all appearance uninjured, but the elder had hurt her left wrist. Some small bone was probably broken, and she was now crying piteously as she stood below the embankment where Vera, lying on the earth, gave no signs of life. Prince Michael, distracted between noise and fear, while endeavouring with a pocket-handkerchief and an ivory paper-knife to tie up the suffering hand and arm, cast round him helpless glances, now at his daughter, and now at the crowd. But the bystanders were all as busy, as terrified, and as helpless as were the Zamiatines. The engine-driver had been tossed off and stunned, the stoker was badly hurt, half-a-dozen passengers in the first carriage severely scalded or burnt ; wounded people were being carried about, and water called for,"], [294, "282 v\u00a3ra, and called for in vain, while a fire of hastily collected weeds, and other materials, was lit to throw some additional light on the confused scene. The moon was sailing high, for it was now about half- past nine, and her radiance shone on this great solitary plain, in the middle of which about eighty persons, all helpless and bewildered, were trying to discover the extent of their misfortune or danger, and also their chances of succour. The guard, who was himself badly hurt, said that they were about three and a half miles short of Entressen, the third, and last station on the Crau. Prince Michael learned this with great distress. His scared, and screaming companion was sufficiently aware of their plight to be as much frightened as she was hurt : the two Russian maids were useless, and calling on their saints, while Julie and M. Anelli, the courier, were engaged in a vociferous squabble about some of their properties, which M. Anelli justly feared might be seized on by common consent to keep up the fire near the broken engine, and the more seriously damaged of the passengers. Just as Prince Michael's distress was at its climax, a well-known voice said, \" Can I be of any use ? \" and a well-known figure, that of the one-armed Earl of Kendal, appeared at his side. \" I should be grateful indeed to any one who would take my daughter out of sight and sound ; for every"], [295, "AT LAST. 283 time that she comes to herself, and opens her eyes, and sees the blazing train, and hears the cries of the wounded, she goes off in a fresh swoon.\" By what eloquence of tongue, or of purse, I know not, but Lord Kendal succeeded in two minutes in getting some one to lift up the unhappy girl, and to carry her for a couple of hundred yards to the rear of the train, to where, on that bare and sandy plain, there were a few rather larger stones, and where, in their shelter, a few lavender, and wormwood bushes grew. Under such slight cover as these might offer they laid Vera down, out of sight, at least, of the wounded, and Lord Kendal only breathed freely when she was left alone in his care, so bitterly had he envied the two-armed passenger who had had the power to carry her to this place of safety. The moonlight was bright enough to show her deadly pallor, her wasted hands, her colourless lips. Surely she must have been ill, he said to himself, and delayed by the way, possibly at Marseilles, while he, coming tnat day from Toulon, had fancied them to be already half-way to St. Petersburg. He bent over her, and held his breath to listen for hers. Alas ! there was none. He laid his head on her breast, but no heart-beat met his ear ; only his own heart leapt madly as he touched, for the first time, this ex quisite frame, and his hand trembled as he tried to"], [296, "284 VERA unfasten the ribbon, and the collar at her neck. Within them lay the big string of pearls on an apparently pulse less throat. \" Vera ! \" he called hoarsely, \" Vera ! \" and, in his great despair, kissed the hem of her dress, her hair, her forehead, and her cold hands. \" Vera ! \" but she neither spoke nor stirred. Lifting her head tenderly with his hand, he tried to prop it with her hat, worrying himself at his one handed awkwardness, when he only succeeded in un rolling more of her hair, and in turning her profile a little, so that now the still and white face lay under the moonlight, straight and white like the dead. Was she dead ? Had it been ordered that he who had seen Alexis die, should also see Vera lie dead at his feet ? \" Vera ! for pity's sake, my child ! my darling ! live. Vera, my beloved, live ! or, 0 my Maker ! let me also die ! Vera ! \" But even to this appeal there was no response, only the confused hubbub from the train, a tinkling sheep-bell near, and a small cloud \"as it drifted across the moon, threw its shadow on the plain. \"Water! \" he cried, \"water! a fortune for a cup of water ! \" for with water she would surely revive. But where is water to be met with on the Crau ? unless indeed in its mirages. It was hopeless. At last he dared to put his mouth to hers, and to"], [297, "285 AT LAST. breathe into her nostrils, while he strained her to his heart. At length, 0 triumph ! he heard something like a sigh, and saw a quiver in her eyelids. Then he rose. For when she should first open her eyes they must not light on him ; in her sight he was a guilty man, and perhaps if he were suddenly to appear before her, she might again drop off into that border-land of unconsciousness, from which his breath had only just recalled her. He retreated then behind her, and the little more than knee-deep wild herbs which screened her. From thence he could watch unseen. After stretching out her arms and opening her eyes, Vera came to herself enough to raise herself partially, and to lean on one hand. She looked around her, and drew a long breath. For a second she remained so, silent and half reclining, then, resuming probably the train of thought which she had been following when she fell asleep, she looked down wonderingly at herself. Wrapping closely round her limbs, and fastened to her shoulders, hung her long white dust-cloak, and below it her black dress covered her feet. She fancied that the first of these was her winding-sheet \u2014 that she had died \u2014 so bewildered still was her mind, \u2014 and then that in some unexplored strange country beyond the grave, she had wakened thus prematurely, and alone."], [298, "286 VERA. \"Alone ! \" she said ; \" after living, and dying alone, how hard it is to be alone still ! \" Sitting more upright she again gazed around her, and what she saw confirmed her more and more in her hallucination. This vast level plain, with neither man, nor tree, nor boundary, was surely in another world ; this pale white light, flooding all, was the dawn of Heaven's great morning ; and these few scant stones, which with the still scanter shrubs dotted the expanse of sand, seemed to her the gravestones of the dead, now all sealed and silent, and casting their shadows before them, but soon to be opened, and rent. By what miserable chance had she awakened alone, anticipating with this cruel haste the resurrection of the blessed ? Where were her own dead ? \" Maman! \" she called plaintively, and held out a be seeching hand. \" Venez done (come then), Simony ! Alexei, do not leave me alone. Henri ! at least you will come to me, for I have loved you so much and so well \u2014 Henri!\" Hearing his spirit so adjured, the living Henry St. John moved to her side, and called her by name, while the moon threw his unmistakeable shadow before her. Then suddenly, and like one who by calling has really invoked a spirit, she flung up her arms above her head with a loud sharp cry, and sprang to her feet. Tottering, she first fell sobbing on his shoulder, then slipped"], [299, "287 AT LAST. down to the ground, and there buried her face in her hands. \" What has happened ? \" she gasped ; now for the first time fully awake to reality. \" An accident, but you are safe, and with me ; and you love me, and have called for me, my heart's darling, my own ! \" \" You love me, Henry ? you love me ? \" \" Since I first saw you, Vera, I have loved you, and none but you ; I could love, and I can love, none but you.\" \" Say it again,\" she whispered. He said it again and again, putting his lips to her hair as her head rested above his heart. She was sobbing. \" Why do you weep, my child, my only one ? \" \" Because I am so happy,\" and then first she looked him in the face, and he dried away all her tears. \" Have you no fears ? \" he asked, after a pause, in which no words seemed to have been needed : \" are you not afraid to marry a man twenty years older than your self \u2014 to live in England, a grave country, far from your kindred and faith ? \" To this, for sole response, Vera vouchsafed a smile \u2014 a smile that overflowed her mouth, as you have seen water overflow the fountain's brim. \" And can you marry a maimed man, one who can"], [300, "288 VERA. never protect you well in danger, or nurse you in sickness ? \" Lord Kendal evidently still thought regretfully of not having been able to carry her, and he waited for her reply.

Then in a lower whisper he said, \" Can you marry the man who killed Alexis ? \" and he feared to see her grow paler, or flinch before she answered. She shook back the strands of her hair, and stood up pale,. but firm, as she put her hand on his. \" Henry,\" she said, \" we know that it was an accident \u2014 to be forgiven, as Alexis himself forgave it, and as God has pardoned it.
