I was little more than a child when I first came across the outline of William Hutton's life, and thought \" what a good tale it would make.\" A few years later, when I was the wife of a Birm ingham man, I met with Hutton's history of that town, and his own autobiography also. The same thought recurred to me, with the addendum that I should like to be the writer of the tale. At that time I had laid down my literary pen, and did not take it up again for a long and changeful period. Meanwhile the outline biography first read turned up occasionally in the same old maga zine and kept the original idea alive. In 1864 I sat down to my pen- work in earnest, following up fugitive poems with \" God's Providence House,'' and just as I had begun to collect materials for \" The Manchester Man \" far in advance of my writing, so, as far back as 1868, began my slow gathering of materials for the story now before my readers, accumulating in the process much that was useless for my purpose.

How far I am justified in working the facts of a real life into fiction may be a matter of opinion. At all events in so doing I only follow illustrious examples, from Shakespeare downwards, and no one would be better pleased than William Hutton himself could he know.

CHAPTER I. HARD BLOWS. It was Nottingham race week, July, 1741. The town was astir with life and animation, from the lowest meadow on the banks of the shining Trent and Leen, to the highest tier of rocky street ; aye, or to the Castle perched on its solitary steep high above them all. All was astir save the windmills, and they seemed to take holiday lazily, out of regard for the breezeless air. Holidays and amusements for the people were few, and the excitement rose in proportion. Amongst the toilers especially \u2014 with them the festival became almost a carnival, second only to that of the Goose Eair at Michaelmas.

Was it not also a week of rejoicing to the wee toilers of tender years, who were so lucky as to have a day or two of release ? Aye, the very rock on which old Notting ham was built must have felt it to its inmost cavern, as the streets re-echoed the sound of running feet, laughter and salutation, whether the tones were soft and silvery, or resonant and rough. The aged and careworn, sick and solitary, must have felt it, some in gladness, some in gloom. And the workers to whom the holi day had been denied must have felt it, and not pleasantly. There was one youth, in his eighteenth year, to whom the week had been neither pleasant nor profitable. The sunshine and the laughter, the wood lands and the wild-flowers, the walks by the broad bright waters, the display of new attire before admiring feminine eyes, had been joys denied to him. And the joys of his life had been so few, so very few, that the deprivation had been the greater hardship. He was, more over, of a lively, cheerful disposition, one who loved better to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak, and he resented accordingly the"], [15, "HARD BLOWS 3 harshness which kept him close at his stock ing-frame, when all the other apprentices were allowed their liberty. The work-shop, or frame-room, was on the ground floor, and more than one of AVilliam Hutton's companions had put his head in at the small-paned casement of the window, which almost reached from wall to wall, open on account of the heat, and asked \\\\\\\\y he could not join them. Worse than all had been the alternate jeers and commiseration of a fellow apprentice named Joseph Roper, a farmer's son, who had long been urging William to break his bonds and run off along with him. \" Come along, Will,\" that worthy had said on the Saturday morning, as he left the lair by courtesy called a bed, \" the lasses are all about as fine as fi'pence. What's the good of thy new clothes if thou mayn't show them ? Art' afead of thy uncle's stick ? \" \"No.\" But the no was not by any means hearty. \" Well, thou mowt be, or thou'd not sit there at thy frame when all t'others are enjoy ing theirselves. Dolly says as thou'rt a bit of a coward : an' I think it's true, for if thoud'st a spark of spirit thou'd be up an' off.\" Roper was gone, but he had left behind a sting to rankle in the young fellow's breast. 1\u20142"], [16, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 4 \" Dolly thought him a coward, did she ?

It may be there was latent within his breast the grain of truth which poisoned the random shalt. Was he not bound hand and foot to his uncle, George Hutton, as closely as any other apprentice to any other master ? And what if his brother Thomas, as close a bond-slave, bore his lot with passive equanimity. Was it more endurable to himself, who had a different temperament, and chafed under the hardships and restrictions he dared not resent ? Had not his uncle added poignancy to Roper's sting over that very morning's breakfast ? \" You may have this day to yourself, Tom,\" he had said. \"You have stuck quietly to your work all week and finished your task ; and if you have not the nimble fingers of Will, here, ' slow and steady goes tar in a day.'

Was it not she who in her parsimony and hypocrisy had settled that Will and Tom \" had best be kept at their frames all the race week out of the way of temptation ? \" And did he not know that, besides his uncle's legal power to restrain or punish, she at least had all the will? Had he not seen one tender apprentice goaded by starvation, ill-usage, hard and uncongenial work, boldly run away, only to be brought back, beaten, and set at his frame with a log chained to his foot ?

Previous apprenticeship in a silk mill had given to William a delicate nicety of touch, and such had been his skill and dexterity that during fully half of his past three years' service he had been employed only to make the finest thread or silk stockings, and both he and his master knew him to be a good hand. But he, that week, had Avorked with such leaden fingers that only the closest unremitting toil and attention could enable him to complete his appointed task for the day ; and for that he was in no congenial mood. He went to the open window, and leaning on the sill with his coarse shirtsleeves rolled up, watched the passers-by, and brooded over his own wrongs instead of taking his place at his frame to make the best of matters. He had quite depended on having at least the Saturday to himself, and had arranged to"], [19, "HARD BLOWS 7 walk with Thomas and two or three others to the Shepherd's Race, a maze or labyrinth in the green turf, now ploughed up, but then in existence, at Sneinton, about two miles from the town, and much frequented by young people, who amused themselves by chasing each other through its hollow turns and windings. Dolly, the wonderful Dolly, the lacemaker, to whom in his shabbiness he had never yet ventured to speak, was to be of the party, and he had hoped for an opportunity to break the ice, and perhaps win a word or a smile from her. And now all this was at an end. She thought him a coward because he dared not brave the cudgel and make his own holiday. This served him as a reminder of his Uncle George's threat. He turned from the window, looked disconsolately at the empty frames in the rooms, like so many big skeletons of easy chairs, with rows of wire teeth grinning at him in their high backs, and stepped over the wooden side-bar of his own frame with a heavy sigh. He sat down on the narrow seat with his back against the low wooden bar for support, and soon, with his feet on the treadles and his head bent, his fingers were at work looping the thread on the outer needles, and the double rows of fine bright wires went glancing up and down, in and out,"], [20, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 8 with a metallic creak ; but his heart did not throb eagerly to his singer tips, and the long stocking grew but slowly.* George Hutton was not a racing man. He had gone to Leicester on business, and whilst there had heard of the failure of a London hosier who owed him a hundred pounds, a large sum to a man with but small capital \u2014 the value of money being very much greater than now, as it may be well to remember. He had mounted his nag in the morning with full saddle-bags, and an additional load of ill-humour, as little pleased with himself as with his nephew-apprentice. He returned at the close of the long July day, weary, depres sed, and or t of sorts altogether. Trade had been too bad to empty his saddle-bags, and he had an extra load in the knowledge of his great loss, which it might take him years to repair. Into the frame-room he marched, deter mination in every step his heavy riding-boots set on the hard white plaster floor. Down went William's courage into his very shoes, for his work was not yet done. It would have taken an hour or more to complete it. \" So you have not done the task I ordered ?'' began the elder. * One of these antique stocking frames was on show at the lat,; Health Exhibition, minus the l.ar at the back of the seat."], [21, "HARD BLOWS. 9 Never a word said the conscience-stricken youth in the frame. \" Was it in your power to have done it ? \" Still silence. \" Could you have done it ? \" William Hutton did not foster lying among his shortcomings. He could not screen him self by a subterfuge. Without looking up, he answered, timidly enough, \"I could.\" .Maybe his uncle took the answer for the utterance of a dogged sullenness. \" Then I'll make thee,\" he said in a quiet tone of concentrated wrath, the gathered ire of a day's annoyance. William shrank within the narrow confines of his frame. He saw his uncle wrest the long stale or handle of white hazel wood from a ling besom, kept in a far corner to sweep up the flue and bits of yarn from the plaster floor, and come towards him grasping the tough and rugged .stick in his right hand. With his left he clutched at the young man's waistcoat collar, and, heedless of his entreaties, dragged him from the shelter of the frame in which he was crouching, and said with deliberate incisiveness, as he held the long, thick broom-handle over him, \" Many a time and oft have you been told, 'Whatsoever thy hand sindeth to do, do it with thy might.' You have not put your might into your work"], [22, "IN HIS OWN HAXD. 10 this week. But I will give you such a lesson to-night as shall serve you as long as you live. I have to punish sloth and disobedience, and I shall certainly do it with my might.\" And he did. There was no remorse, no re lenting, the stockinger's face was set and hard as a flint, and had his nephew's body been a senseless stone he could not have rained his blows upon it with less compunction. As the heavy stick came down with a re peated thud, thud, thud on the writhing form of the ill-fed apprentice, his piteous shrieks, \" Mercy, mercy, uncle ! Don't, don't ! Mercy ! \" rent the air ; but George Hutton might have been deaf. Others were not. The windows were open, the evening calm, the resounding blows and cries together roused the neighbourhood. An inquiring crowd gathered outside the house, intruded within the guardian palisades, but there was no hope of rescue for the shrieking victim on whom the blows continued to fall until he thought every bone in his body was broken. \" What's the matter ? \" William heard one ask in the outside throng. \" Oh ! only Hutton thrashing one of his lads ! \" was the answer. \" Is that all ? \" And no more pity or curiosity was exhibi-"], [23, "HARD BLOWS. 11 ted, so common, so very common an occurrence was the thrashing of an apprentice within an inch of his life. No, though it was not until the tough hazel stick broke in his weary hand that George Hutton ceased to belabour the nephew en trusted to his care and keeping (who had laboured, against the grain, for his sole profit), never, in all that while, did aunt or pitiful neighbour once interfere to arrest a blow. Custom had deadened compassion. And it was not until the panting master wrung the sweat from his brow, and flung the broken handle into a corner, that the cower ing slave ventured to mutter, \" I wish Mr. Webb had been at home, I do. Ye'd ha' been ashamed to serve a dog as you've served me, before him.\" \"Would I, j'ou lazy good-for-naught ? \" A gleam as of fresh lightning shot from unquiet eyes, as the words burst in a stormy gust from angry lips, and a swollen hand went forth in voluntarily towards the discarded cudgel ; '\u2022 What care I for Mr. Webb? \" Alarmed by the effects of his own temerity, the cowed lad slunk away from the dread pre sence of superior power, and with many a sob and groan sought the carret where his hard chaff bed seemed to be filled with stones, so sore was every joint and limb. But not a"], [24, "IN HIS OWN HAXD. 12 bruise on his body was smarting like the wounds inflicted on his pride and self-respect. It might have been some balm for those wounds could he have seen how the reference to Mr. Webb had re-acted on his uncle, or the shame he felt that what he had done must reach that individual's ears. An hour or so later, Roper, Thomas and another lad came up the stairs in the dark as usual, Roper in high glee and mock sympathy, adding to his pain with a storjr of the day's delights, and a string of invented anecdotes. He wound up with \" Bill had best ha' gone too. He could but ha' been licked then ; and sticking at his frame hath not saved his bacon. He hath not the spirit of a mouse, or he'd ne'er ha' stood thrashing like a mongrel cur. Afore I'd ha' taken such a licking I'd ha' snatched th' besom stale out o' master's hands and cracked his crown with it ! Ay, if I'd gone to gaol fur it ! \" An oath closed this bold assertion, as Roper threw himself on his hard pillow, well satisfied with his vaunted prowess, and its effects on the other. William had feigned sleep through it all, but as Thomas stretched his tired limbs along side his brother's aching ones, and dragged the rug which served for bed-clothes, or slightly touched him, nature was too strong for deception, and an ill-suppressed moan told"], [25, "HARD BLOWS. 13 the braggart that he was awake, and must have heard. Ay, awake ! And so he lay all that night through, thinking, thinking, thinking, and still thinking, his mind as full of pain as his body. And when the dawn peered stealthily in through the thick bull's-eye panes of the small window, tingeing all their faces a sallow green, it found him still awake, and still thinking out the unsolvable problem of his young life. Hard words, hard fare, and hard knocks had been his from his earliest years. Was it possible to find the outer world harder than he had found his own kith and kin ? Had not Roper over and over again advised him to run away \u2014 nay, offered to be his com panion? Buthe had no faith in Roper : he might want him out of the wa}r, and if he ran off all chance of Dolly was gone.

Not with the others : he did not care to strip before them and expose the wheals and bruises which he felt as a shame and a disgrace to his rising manhood. He had a clean shirt on Avhen he followed the others doAvn to wash at the pump in the yard at the back ; and being exempted from the menial duties of the ordinary 'prentice by the necessity to keep his fingers soft and delicate to handle the silk he knitted up, he was able to come down to the breakfast the others had helped to prepare, in his new suit of best clothes, bent on showing his braA7ery in more senses than one. He was not the first to gather courage from a good suit of clothes, and will not be the last. His gave him courage to slight the friendly overtures of his uncle, who had slept his anger off, and was no doubt sorry, and to pay no heed to the cutting allusions of his aunt, avIio was not sorry. When he left the house Avith the rest to go to the Meeting- House \u2014 the Huttons were Dissenters \u2014 he went in anything but a spirit of forgiveness or humility in the sight of his Creator. His chief thought was of captivating and en slaving the hitherto unapproachable Dolly Avhen he met her in his new braA^ery. Service over, churches and meeting-house alike sent forth their congregations, but the"], [27, "HARD BLOWS. 15 fair one Avas not to be seen. He had dressed for naught. \" Have some cherries, Will ? \" said his uncle, pushing the plate towards him after dinner. Thrusting the peace-offering aside Avith disdain, he stalked out into the garden and leant OA'er the wooden palisades in gloomy resentment. All at once his eyes rested on Dolly coming along the lane with streaming pink ribbons on her straw hat, and a bright gingham skirt inflated by a hoop, which Avas a vulgar caricature of high fashion. All lace was then hand made, and the worker felt her own importance. He raised his new three-cornered hat as deferentially as if she had indeed been a lady ; flushing from his brow to finger-tips. He had never heard a syllable from those red lips. He hardly dared hope she Avould open them for him. He Avould be content with a smile of recognition. She did recognize him. She turned her face towards him in passing. A smile of intense scorn curled those ruddy lips, and lit with baleful rays the eyes he had adored as heaATenly blue. She spoke. \" So yow Avarr licked last neet ! \" came sneeringly out between those i'oavs of pearly"], [28, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 16 teeth, and the lips he had so often longed to kiss. Six Avords only ! But they scathed like lightning ; killed on the spot loAre, admiration, respect. His eyes followed her, opened Avide, but his heart shrank and closed.

THE RUNAWAY. \" A fair face and a cruel heart,\" William Hutton muttered to himself as the girl turned a corner and Avas lost to sight. \" I've learned more from my uncle's ' licking ' than was counted on overnight. I've been an ass, and been paid like an ass. But I won't need the same lesson twice. My mind's made up now,\" and with his face set gloomily, he turned indoors. His soberly-dressed uncle and aunt were about to start for the Meeting-House on the Loav Pavement, whither the apprentices Avere expected to folloAv. He took his hat from the peg and put it on his head as if to join them, but as Thomas and Roper Avent out at the door, he slipped up the shady staircase instead. \"Where's that Will?\" he heard his aunt in the passage below ask peevishly. There was a tone of self-reproach in the milder Aroice of his uncle as he ansAvered, \" Gone on before, poor lad. He takes the thrashing I gave him more to heart than I VOL.

' Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying,' \" replied the aunt severely, as she passed the foot ofthe dark stairs, which rose abruptly from the passage, and ran between the walls of the frame-room and the house place at the back. \" Aye, aye, Ann, so you said last night ; but I've a notion that if Ave'd ever had a son of our own, you'd have found a milder scrip ture, and I'd ha' taken a softer stick to Will.\" The snapping to of the door, and the turn ing of the key in the lock, droAvned any reply the childless wife might have made. Will turned to the Avork before him Avith out waste of time, now the coast was clear, not, hoAvever, without a momentary feeling of compunction for the loss his uncle Avould sus tain when his best silk knitter was gone. There was no longer any question of his stay ing, Dolly had decided that. He seemed to forget his smarting limbs in the newer smart, as he doffed his fine new suit of brown cloth, and having donned his older one, made free with an old leather saddle-bag, long and narrow, into which they went with"], [31, "THE RUNAWAY. 19 due care. A linen bag, such as AA'as used to fetch raw silk from the spinners, was hastily crammed with a coarse blend-corn loaf (a mixture of barley, wheat, and rye), some butter in an old copybook leaf, one or two needful articles of apparel ; a neAv Bible for which he had recently given three of his hardly-earned shillings ; and at the top of all, to preserve it from crushing \u2014 his best Avig. Most men at that time sought to improve upon nature by shaving their pates, and cov ering them with substitutes for the hair God gave : but as all men had not the means to pay for perukes of real hair, the heads of poorer ones Avere artificially thatched Avith sheep's wool, with which, perhaps, they had some sort of affinity. Having disposed of his wig, and tied the ends of the two bags together, he bethought him that he was penniless, and that it Avas impossible to face the Avorld Avithout money. Swift upon the thought began a hasty rummage, for time Avas flying and the longest service must have an end, Avhether at church or chapel. He knew George Hutton kept his money and Araluable papers in a curious old oak desk that he had bought from his wife's father, a desk with a carved front and tAvo supple mentary drawers like wings on either side. 2\u20142"], [32, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 20 To this he went at once ; but though all the rest of the house was open to him the desk was locked, and for a moment he was baffled. He was searching for the means to flee, but such a crime as forcing the lock Avas no more a dream of his than was the ruthless forcing of that same lock in the far future. Only for a moment he stood dismayed. In the wainscotted parlour upstairs stood an oaken b\u0153uffet, in Avhich Avas kept glass and china as something too rare for common use, as was the room itself. Just as his heart began to fail he caught a gleam at the bottom of a tall glass. There lay ten shillings ready to his hand. Afraid of his own temerity, yet with scarcely a reflection that he Avas stealing, he took \u2014 not the ten \u2014 but two shillings from the ten, and reclosed the b\u0153uffet. There Avas no outlet but the front door, aud that Avas locked. The small back yard Avas shut in by a Avail higher than his own head. It looked formidable, but determination soon landed both himself and his bags on the other side in a narrow bye-Avay. \" Hullo !

His direct Avay Avas either past St. Peter's Church or by the Poultry, through the long Avedge-shaped Market Place, and out at Chapel Bar. But hoAA-eA'er deserted the long Market Place and its crosses might be in service-time, it Avas far too open for a runaAvay, and the cramped out let of the Bar Gate Avas not to be thought of. It held a public-house and loungers. Afraid if he loitered he might be spied by the whipper-in of St. Peter's, and all be lost, he turned to his left, plunged into the shade of the over-hanging houses of Bridlesmith Gate, and so on by devious bye-Avays, under garden Avails and hedges, there so plentiful, until he freed himself from the toAAm by the Avoodyard beyond the time-Avorn bastions of the Bar Gate, on the ATery top of Avhich flourished a sine garden and a giant sycamore.

He was shivering with cold as Avell as with pain and hunger, but before he satisfied the latter he laved his face and hands in the clear Avaters of a rillet that supplied a pool for the cattle. He had been trained to consider clean liness next to godliness, though it was not a cleanly generation. To cut his loaf he dreAV from his breeches' pocket a curious knife. It Avas of silver, shaped liked a pair of hands in close-clasp, Avith ruffles at each Avrist, and contained three blades, a corkscrew, and a cuiwed instrument called a picker, to remove stones from horses' shoes. At some time or other it had evidently been gilt, and engraved upon one ruffle Avas a setting sun and the letters P.W. As he opened the large blade he said, \" Mr. Webb's knife comes in handy.\" Then folloAved the troubled thought, \" I hope he Avon't think because I stole the tAvo shillings, that I ran off with his knife on purpose. He gave me strict charge to take care of it when he left it with me to mend my pens. He will not know that I had forgotten it Avhen I ran off, and aunt is sure to make the worst of me.

From extreme north to south, folloAving the river line, the town did not cover a mile of ground, nor half of a mile Avestwards from the Derwent, its eastern limit.

For the last time he regaled on his rapidly decreasing loaf. Then leaving his bags and his best hat confid ingly under the close green hedge Avhere he had supped, he made the circuit of tie large barn to discover a possible inlet, but the door was closed against him. \" I don't relish another night on the grass, and I've no pence to spare for lodgings in the city,\" said he, moodily, as he Avent back dis appointed to the hedge-corner.

He had had his supper such as it Avas. Where Avas his Avretchedness to find a bed ? Alone Avith his despair he stood that night in Litchfield Market Place, under the shining stars, with only a butcher's hard block whereon to rest his aching head, his blistered feet. He was weary, but sleep came not.

'' No answer came to his inner questioning, no relief to his mental agony. The light of dawn was only darkness to him, overAvhelmed by the consequences of his own act. He stood there vacantly watching the open ing of the shop, Avhere Samuel Johnson had been born, stood full only of self-pity, not knowing what to do, or whither he should turn. In the urgency of hunger he accosted a sleek Avell-to do individual on a doorstep, whose tooth-pick told of an early breakfast. If he had any hope to feast on the debris of the banquet seen through a window he was disappointed. The gentleman was only \" very sorry, ATery sorry,\" thought \" the case most distressing,\" and gave him \u2014 advice. \" If you are in want of work you had better follow yonder people to Walsall. It is market day. There you may be successful.\" With a heavy sigh William took all he gave, followed the market people, broke his fast on a couple of carrots from a farmer's cart, for which he paid a halfpenny, and worn out with the rugged and trackless road, over waste and common to the little hardware town, found himself, during the forenoon in"], [45, "HOMELESS. 33 Walsall, Avhere the eleATated parish church looked doAvn upon him. Full of his Avoes he poured them forth to move compassion. A butcher gave him a scrap of fat to anoint his blistered feet. Then a man selling stockings at a stall in the Market Place counselled him to seek work in Birmingham, Coventry, or Worcester, volun teering a recommendation to an acquaintance in the first of these places. The pain in his heart must have overcome the pain of his feet, for he set his face towrards Birmingham Avith resolute determina tion. \" It's only about nine mile more,\" said he, \" I'd think naught o' that if my feet Avasn't so bad, and may be I'll see a turnip field bye-and-by.\" A AA'eary sigh pointed the sentence, never theless he trod the miles down one by one through a country of coalpits and open forges, Avhere smutty women, stripped to the Avaist, wielded the hammer at the anvil alongside the men, and struck him dumb with the sight. But he found that the region pro duced more hard nails than succulent turnips, and Avas not sorry Avhen he had left the smithy land behind.

Indeed, to that may be due the fact that, as he stood among the golden blossomed gorse on the verge of the heath, more homeless than the rabbits scuttering to their burrows at his approach, the town he beheld from his elevation bore so fair an aspect. With his hunger appeased the grass was greener beneath his feet, the sky Avas clearer and bluer overhead, and as he left the war rener's lone hut behind and looked across an expanse of verdant fields and trees, the after noon sun burnished the windows and cupola of St. Philip's, and attracted his admiring gaze to the noble church standing on an eminence alone in all its fresh architectural beauty amid a broad belt of foliage. He looked beyond it to the tall edifices partially enclosing the green churchyard and on good buildings everywhere. And as the sun shone on red-tiled roofs he bethought him that he saw no signs of thatch, and none of the wretched hovels he found on the outskirts of other towns. He fell in love with the place before he set a foot therein.

Good after noon.\" The brisk young felloAv Avas gone before William could well thank him, but not before he had printed form and features on a reten tive memory. A two-gabled black and white building, with a door between two bay AvindoAvs, and an ascent of three or four well-worn steps was all that William saw as he stepped across, fearing as much as hoping. Doffing his hat he said to the grave Mr. Evans, with suitable humility, \" I am a frame-knitter out of work, sir; can you employ me ? \" \" Thou art a 'prentice ! \" Avas the only response. \" No, sir, I am not. I come with the re commendation of your friend, Mr. Jonas Smith, of Walsall.\" The keen eyes of the Quaker Avere not to be blinded. \" Go about thy business, I tell thee,"], [49, "HOMELESS. 37 thou'rt a runaway 'prentice,\" was his stern rejoinder. With the dread of the House of Correction before his eyes, William stumbled down the steps, Avondering where his business lay, and if he had any in life. To Mr. Grace, who knew his friends in Derby, he Avas afraid to go. He asked his Avay to a Mr. Holmes, in Dale End, also named by the Walsall man. Thence he was still more curtly dismissed. A penny was put into his hand, with a \"Take that and let's be shut of thee.\" He Avas clearly taken for a beggar. The day was speeding, and he Avas not. He turned back, found the GateAvay, a curious old building, once the ancient Leather Hall, Avhich blocked the entrance into NeAV Street, Avhere a golden stocking hung out as a sign. He trembled in every limb as he crossed the threshold, and addressed the master of the shop. \" Sir, I am a poor frame-knitter out of Avork. Can you giA-e me employment? \" \" Out of Avork, eh ? Where dost' come from ? \" \" Derby,\" was the reply. \" Derby, eh ?

Birmingham at that time boasted two market crosses, somewhat similar in construction, the one knoAvn as the Welsh Cross, a little below the fork of Bull Street and Dale End, and the other, or Old Cross, at the upper end of the Bull Ring or Market Place. It is probable that they occupied the sites of veritable stone crosses of ancient date, and that the Welsh Cross had originally commemorated some Avar-like irruption of that fiery people. But Avhen desponding William Hutton seated himself on the low step of the Old Cross, it Avas merely a square building pierced by a pair of archways on every side, and Avith three windows above these to light a chamber over all. A handsome octagonal bell-tOAver, surrounded by iron rails, adorned the four sided roof. This was surmounted by a gilt vane to tell the market people how the wind blew, whilst a clock above the southern front proclaimed Iioav time was speeding on. In this Old Cross the farmers' wives and"], [53, "THE RUNAWAY'S RETURN 41 daughters Avere supposed to sell their butter and poultry under cover, whilst the open area of the Bull Ring (surrounded as it Avas with quaint irregularly constructed shops, indicated by symbolic signs) held not only the shambles, the bull-stake, the corn market, but open stalls for all sorts of wares, whilst dealers in hardware and crockery spread their goods out on the ground, both in the Corn Cheaping and Spicer Street to the left and to the right of St. Martin's parish church at the foot of the hill, a church to be imagined from its visible spire, a troop of houses huddled round the graveyard having shut the old church itself out of sight. Nothing of this Avas apparent to William Hutton as he sat with his elboAv on his knee and his head on his hand, the very picture of abject misery, whilst people went past on their oavh business, and took no note of him. He heard the clock OATerhead strike seven, and counted the strokes mechanically ; and it seemed to impress him hazily that workshops must be closing, there seemed so many more people about, all of whom had somewhere to go and something to expect. As for himself he had ceased to expect or to hope. He Avas seated on the north side of the cross, Avith his mournful face turned westwards. Presently he became conscious that tAvo Avork-"], [54, "42 IN HIS OWX HAXD. ing men wearing leather aprons had stopped at the corner of Philip Street, and he had an uneasy sense of their close scrutiny. They crossed the roadAvay to him. \" You seem by your melancholy situation and your dusty shoes,\" said one, \" a forlorn traveller, Avithout money, and without friends.\" The remainder of his two shillings must have been overlooked, or truth have grown an incumbrance, for he answered with a long drawn sigh, \" That's exactly what I am. Just. I'm footsore with walking in search of Avork. No one Avill employ me. And I have been robbed of all I had in the world on the road.\" \" Well, my boy,\" said the man, \" I know what it is to be distressed. If you choose to accept a pint it is heartily at your service.\" William's eye lighted. To his despair they seemed the kindest words he had heard since he left Nottingham. \" I shall receive any favour with thankful ness \" he replied, as he rose stiffly to his feet. At a public-house called the Bell, in Philip Street, his compassionate entertainers set bread and cheese and ale before him, saying cheerily, \" Fall to and help thyself.\" He obeyed them to the full, they Avatchinghim in apparent enjoyment of his feast, through memories of their own hungry expei ience"], [55, "THE RUNAWAY'S RETURN. 43 The men, who said they worked for Simon Onions, the bellowsmaker in Digbeth, after wards showed him where, for three half pence, which they gave him, he could have a bed for the night.

At nine o'clock on the Saturday evening, William Hutton stood once more on the threshold of his father's home in Derby, a suppliant for intercession with his uncle. He had spent a day exploring Birmingham, keeping clear of the three stockingers. Had walked on to Coventry, to Nuneaton, to Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and in all places been received as a runaway apprentice, and threat ened with gaol.

He Avas fairly sober that night, and glad to receive the son he had supposed on the way to Ireland. But though he promised to send to Nottingham in the morning for his brother George, and listened to the run away's tale with moist eyes, in the morning \u2014 although he had kept his word \u2014 he Avas in another frame of mind. \" Look thee, Will,\" he said ; \" if Ave Huttons haAre been unfortunate, and poor as church mice, Ave have been truthful and honest ; and thou hast brought such disgrace on our name with this theft of thine (oh, that son of mine should touch Avhat was not his oavu !) that I shall be ashamed to face my brother.

William, in his spirit of unrest and disquiet, found it impossible to sit still and wait in that stifling miserable room. His week's tramp had set its marks on his apparel, none too good to start with, and worn his shoes into trashes. Personal vanity sent him out of the town, not into it, though leave the reeking house he did.

She Avas swinging her hat by the strings as she skipped along gaily, as light of heart as of form. \"That's a happy little creature,\" thought William with a sigh for contrast. \" I wasn't so lightsome at her age. Who can she belong to, I Avonder ? \" As he wondered a sudden puff of wind caught the hat and sent it whirling out of her hand, and bowling away on its edge as if in clined for a race, or a launch on the brook. She turned to chase it, crying \" Oh, my hat ! \" but had not William been there to intercept its course, she might have been \" left lamenting \" like the maiden in the ballad. As she dropped a demure courtesy and thanked him shyly, he thought she was the prettiest and politest child of her years (he took her for nine or ten) that he had ever seen. \" Oh, thank you, sir.

Before a word was spoken, the runaway knew he was forgiven. There was no mistaking for genuine anger the tone in which George Hutton asked his faulty nephew, \" Are not you to blame ? \" as his first salutation, before the clasped hands parted. It was clear he had taken himself to task for undue severity and held himself in part answerable for the result. William hung his head and was silent, a conflict of feelings and emotions \u2014 surprise, contrition, gratitude, self-abasement \u2014 laid an embargo on his tongue and forbade utterance. He had always considered his uncle kind at heart, though subject to gusts of passion; now he felt that he was benign. He had dreaded his coming as a precursor of fresh punishment. There were not even reproaches. What marvel that the unforgotten beating was scored against the hypocritical aunt as the instigator, when he found his uncle thus. No doubt George Hutton was glad to get his best apprentice back. At all events he sat down on one of the two rush-bottomed chairs as if thankful that a disagreeable business was over.

He talked of the rise in the price of pro visions that year, of the slackness of trade, of his loss by an absconding debtor ; made inquiries into his brother's circumstances, the terms on which Samuel was working at the silk mill, the welfare of his niece Catherine ; made a favourable report of Thomas, who was, he said, \" slow but sure, and easy-going,\" of anything, in .short, but William and his doings, lt was not until his supper was over, and Sam (who had sat on a wooden stool by the fireplace listening with mouth agape) was sent to his bed on a sack under the stairs, that the subject was introduced. Then the father, preparing to smoke the calumet of peace, laid on the table a couple of long clay pipes, a tin box of tobacco, and a fresh mug of ale. Pipes were filled, and with out waiting to be questioned he told the story of the runaway's adventures as it had been told to him, dwelling much on the loss of his good clothes, his privations, and his frugal economising of the stolen two shillings, of which he had brought sixpence back. Of his inability to obtain employment he said little. Once or twice during the recital, William, who had drawn his stooi into the background, 4\u20142"], [64, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 52 caught the echo of a faint \" Poor lad ! \" be tween the whiffs of his uncle's pipe, and that gave another complexion to the open remark. \" Well, he got only his deserts. I hope it will be a lesson to last his lifetime. His own rod whipped him worse than my stick ; so we'll say no more about it, or the stolen money. It was because he had the chance of taking ten shillings and only took two, that his aunt and me consented to take him back and over look it.\" William, gratefully thankful for this full forgiveness, wondered that Mr. Webb's knife was not even referred to ; but it had not suited George Hutton to say how strong an intercessor Mr. Webb had been with the young man's unrelenting aunt, and he remained in ignorance. On the other hand, William kept his own counsel respecting Dolly Parker, and left aunt and uncle both to infer that only the violence of the latter had driven him away. \" I reckon that's thy best suit now, Bill,\" said his uncle in the morning, as they were about to depart for Nottingham. A mournful shake of the head was the sole response. \" Well, thou can neither show thy face at meeting or among the lasses in that plight.

But Mrs. George had a word to say on the subject, as on other matters, and no clothes were forthcoming. \" So, young man,\" was her first salutation, \" you have discovered that ' the way of trans gressors is hard.' I hope you have come back penitent, and grateful for pardon. The Scrip ture saith ' Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good.' Prithee, take that to heart and remember it.\" She took care that, he should remember ; and he was not disposed to forget. He felt his position keenly. Eoper smirked and almost drove him to desperation. He could not show himself amongst his acquaintances for lack of seemly raiment. He felt he had sunk in the estimation of others as well as in his own ; and whatever of spirit or energy he possessed would have been quenched had he not found a friend in the house in the person of old Mr. Webb."], [66, "54 IN HIS OWN HAND. He had accepted William's apology for the accidental carrying away of his knife without the faintest show of doubt or suspicion. In deed, before the assembled household he said, \" Well, Will, I'm glad to have my knife back. I knew you had forgotten it was in your pocket. You are welcome to mend your pens with it at any time ; and when I die }Tou shall have it as a keepsake.\" \" A keepsake forsooth, it's little of keep sakes he deserves,\" quoth Mrs. Hutton, and there the subject dropped. Mr. Webb had made a promise, little sus pecting all it would import in time to come."], [67, "CHAPTER V. MR. WEBB. At one period of William Huston's life an old school-mistress who had fallen on evil days went to lodge under the poor roof of his father, with the remark that \" none of them would be the worse for her coming.\" And seeing that her good manners corrected their rough ones, and that her stores of knowledge were attractively open, and that she contrived to inspire the ignorant young people, William especially, with a craving for book-lore, and as she also taught them the use of the pen, she might have been considered a profitable lodger, however little she paid in coin of the realm. Another lodger, under another roof, in another county, had taken up unwittingly the charmed wand which she had dropped from her pulseless fingers years before, and he was known as Mr. Peter Webb. He was an elderly gentleman, about whom hung a slight flavour of mystery, he said so little of himself or his private affairs, and"], [68, "56 IN HIS OWN HAND. nothing of his family or connections. He was supposed to be in reduced circumstances from the rustiness of his invariable suit of black, and his unmurmuring adoption of a style of living evidently below his proper rank and condition. He had been lodging with George Hutton for about two years previously to William's escapade. At intervals during that period he had gone away \u2014 he never said whither \u2014 for three or four days at a time. It was imagined that he went to recruit his supplies ; but how, or from what source, was equally unknown ; but he was so frugal, made so little display of money, that it was conjectured his means were scanty. He had a keen eye, a slightly aquiline nose, and a well-formed face, but the expres sion was grave and subdued. His eyebrows were white as snow, his forehead was deeply lined, and his tall form was slowly bending at the shoulders, but whether with the burden of care or of years could not be determined. It was whispered here and there that he was a Jacobite in hiding and had another name besides Webb ; and that his threadbare black suit, his black buckles, and his black hose were worn in mourning for the Stuarts ; but if the echoes reached his ears, he only smiled and said nothing. He was, however, a man of culture and"], [69, "MR.

When such conversations took place after business hours, William was ever an attentive listener, and this had caused the observant old gentle man to take especial notice of him, and to foster the youth's craving for knowledge. It was he who set him writing copies to improve his calligraphy, taught him to make and mend his own quill pens, and gave him occasional lessons in cyphering, which he in turn imparted to placid Thomas ; Mrs. George the while regarding these efforts at education as so much \" waste of time,\" only to be tolerated as keeping the lads quiet and out of mischief. At the time of the thrashing Mr. Webb was away on his periodic business, whatever it might be, or he would surely have interfered. And Will was indebted to him for pardon and reinstatement more than he supposed. The old gentleman was quick to perceive Joseph Roper's disposition to taunt and tanta lize the runaway, with Mrs. Hutton's tacit acquiescence, and man\u0153uvered to prevent it as far as possible."], [70, "IN HIS OWX HAND. He sat on the warm Wednesday forenoon by the wide window of the big house-place in a cornerwise arm-chair, on the back of which hung his scratch wig, with a cooler bandana handkerchief drooping lightly over his bald head. He was reading, as was his wont, his favourite \" Universal Magazine,\" whilst Mrs. Hutton, who wore a long check apron to protect her self-coloured linen gown, and had a plain linen cap on her head, went about her domestic work with a sharp nicety well in accord with the spotless white of the plaster floor, and the whiteness ofthe wooden platters and bowds on a dresser as white. It was her baking day, and she was extra busy ; too busy for much conversation. All at once, after a fit of coughing which had caused him to lay down the magazine on his lap, he began, \" Pray, Mrs. Hutton, could you let Will sleep in my room now he has come back ? I am get ting feeble, and should be glad to have a good strong arm to lift me up on my pillow when my cough troubles me in the night-time.\" Prim and speckless Mrs. Hutton looked up from the dough she .was kneading in an earthenware pan on the floor, and shot a sharp glance of inquiry from her black beady eyes across the hearth to the figure in the arm-chair, as she said suggestively,"], [71, "MR. WEBB. 59 \" Roper's stronger than Will.\" \" Aye, and rougher,\" was the quick re joinder ; \" I'd prefer Will.\" And here his voice sank confidentially low, as he observed a gathering cloud on her brow, \" It may be well to keep a sharp eye on the young man for awhile. Evil communications, you know, \u2014 \" and he finished the incomplete sentence with a comprehensive nod, leaving the kneeling bread-maker to her own interpretation. \" Ah, well,\" said she, \" he might be for teaching the others the same trick, or be for setting off again himself. And so, if you don't mind being troubled with the young runagate, it may be a good thing for him and for the others too.

And so he did, but not as she anticipated. Bed-time came, the lads had said \" good night,\" taken off their shoes, and were retreat ing. \" Stay, Will,\" cried his aunt in her sharp, quick tones. \" Here, carry Mr. Webb's rushlight for him, and don't drop the grease on the floor, you are going to sleep in Mr. Webb's room now. And if he wants anything in the night be sure you jump up and get it.\" \" Thank j^ou, aunt, aye, that I will,\" was the brisk and ready response of the \" runa gate,\" as, well pleased at the instruction, he held out his hand for the iron candlestick in which was the long thin rushlight. \"Whew!\" half whistled Roper, \"What's in the wind now ? \" Giving a iog to William's elbow in passing, which nearly extinguished the faint light, and spotted the immaculate floor with tallow (for which Will was takeu to task the next day), he said in jeering under-tones, \" I wish you joy of the change.\" \" And so do I, Will,\" supplemented Thomas in a very different spirit, \" you'll be more comfortable,\" a remark which drew on him a propeller from Roper's fist as they went upstairs in the dark. Will's \" Aye, that I shall ! \" had reached the ear of both. People at that time were not so luxuriously housed as at present. Their wants were fewer ; their habits simpler."], [73, "MR. WEBB. 61 Mr. Webb's room was nothing more than the front attic in the high-pitched gable of the old beam and plaster dwelling ; the lads occupied the back one, and between the two low doorways lay a space open to the stair case, containing a closet in which George Hutton kept his small store of worsted and woollen yarn. The best parlour and bedroom occupied the floor below, over the work-room and house-place, the latter just a better sort of kitchen, having a lean-to supplement at the back up a couple of steps, where the rough housework was done. It must be added that the front parlour slightly over hung the work-room, and the projection had the outer support of two wooden pillars, the barked trunks of young trees. If the rooms were few they were not small, so that even the attics, narrowed by the slope of the roof, were not particularly cramped, and, like every other part of the house, they were scrupulously clean. Indeed, never an outdoor shoe or boot was allowed to mount those well-scrubbed oaken stairs, or tread the upper floors ; the lodger had slippers, the lads their stocking-feet. The floors, dark with age, were bare, save that by the side of the old gentleman's stump bedstead was laid a strip of flossy rug, home made, with pack thread and waste ends of wool"], [74, "62 IN HIS OWN HAND. knitted together. A well-washed linen curtain of red and yellow check hung at the bed-head to screen the occupant from draughts. A table and chair stood beneath the window, a Staffordshire bowl and ewer of water had place thereon, and a looking-glass about a span wide hung on a nail by the window. There were a few prints on the walls, and a shelf of books. Will found that his chaff bed had been mounted on a pallet alongside the other bed, and felt it in some sort promotion. Thinking it over in silence as he helped to remove the rusty black coat from the bent shoulders, which, more than his furrowed face, added years to Mr. Webb's actual age, he ejaculated as if involuntarily \u2014 \" It is all past understanding ! \" \" What is, my lad ? \" queried the elder. \" Oh, many things.\" \" Perhaps I could help you to an under standing, if you would explain,\" said the old man, turning his grave face kindly to the new attendant. \" Well, sir, you know I was thrashed be cause I told the truth. I stole two shillings and was commended because I did not steal ten. Whilst I kept steadily at work, and did my duty, I had my bed on the floor with the rest.

Aunt Ann received me with cutting reproofs, and now she has promoted me to your room and a com fortable bed. It seems as if bad conduct was more in favour than good.

You were not punished for the truth you uttered, but for disobedience, idleness, and supposed bravado. You were not commended for stealing, but for resisting the temptation to steal nivre when the opportunity was there. Your uncle's anger soon evaporates.

And why she should be so hard to me and cross ever since I came back, and suddenly give me a better bed, and in your room, is a hard nut to crack.\" \"Suppose I help you to the kernel,\" and again the old man smiled. \" You and Roper are not good friends. No doubt there is some young lass in the case.\" (William reddened to the top of his crown.) \"Ah! I see I am right ; we'll talk about her another time. Well, I thought you two would be best apart, so straightway bespoke your services in my room \u2014 and here you are.\" William turned to him with grateful eyes. \" Oh, sir, how can I thank you ? Roper has been the torment of my life. I do not think I should have run away but for him.\" \"Aye,\" said Mr. Webb as he rose to his feet, \" was it so ? \" Then with a complete change of countenance he added impressively, \"Thank God, young man, that he led you back to your kindred and to the path of duty! There are some runaways who never return, who shut themselves out wilfully from love and home, and all that gladdens existence ; who in the blindness of anger and prejudice go forth to a life of loneliness and misery ; who repent too late, only to find the gates of the grave barred against restitution.

Remorse and re gret are bad bedfellows. And now \u2014 good night ! \" His whole frame shook with emotion as he wrung the youth's hand, then hurried into bed, and buried his head in the coverlet, as if to stifle a groan. William, who had listened in amazed silence, could only murmur, \" I am thankful, sir ; \" so greatly was his susceptible nature moved by this exhortation which seemed wrung from the inner man like the outpouring of an overburdened heart. In something akin to awe he knelt down to pray ere he crept noiselessly into his new resting-place ; but either the burning rush light or what he had heard kept him long awake, and he was conscious that the occu pant of the other bed was awake also, or given to moaning in his sleep. The following morning Mr. Webb appeared lost in thought, and after breakfast said he had some writing to do and must go upstairs to be quiet and undisturbed. At noon he came down to dinner with the rest, then instead of taking his customary nap went back to his writing, first asking Mr. vol. 1. 5"], [78, "66 IN HIS OWN HAND.

He unlocked it and took from an inner cavity a sealed packet, which he handed to his lodger, who sighed as he said \" Thank you,\" and went up the stairs followed by Mrs. George's sharp eyes. There was a clatter as she cleared away the dishers and wooden trenchers, muttering, \" Surely the house-place might have served his turn. What has he to write of so vast account that he must cocker himself up in the best room, to put the chairs out of place and take the polish off the table I waxed but on Monday. Marry, but less might serve, gentle man though he be.\" Whatever he wrote, it was placed in the packet which was re-sealed with a ring the writer always wore, and at tea-time, when the lads came in for their milk and bread, was again handed over to George Hutton to be replaced by him in the oaken desk, there to be undisturbed \u2014 how long ?

Anxious to atone for the past and to repair his own losses he had been working late and early most assiduously, and unwilling to lose an hour stuck to his frame until an extraor dinary clatter made by his feet on the treadles attracted his uncle's attention. He was out of his own frame in an instant \u2014 the journeymen and apprentices looking on and passing comments, whilst he helped Will from his seat into the house-place \u2014 all kind ness.

He had turned back to say \u2014 \" Mistress, when you spoke of a judgment on yon poor lad, did it occur to you that God's judgment is denounced on many secret sins, and that the rash act of a simple lad in fleeing from oppression is not in the category ?

If there was a feverish flush on William's face when he turned from his uncle's gate, it was white enough when he came out of the apothecary's leaning heavily on his brother Thomas, with his jacket sleeve loose, his arm bandaged up, and a sprinkling of crimson on linen and small-clothes. His veins had been drained to faintness, he was dizzy, and inclined to stumble as he went. He was ill, of that there was no question. Flaxen-haired Dolly Parker, sitting in the open door-way for the light and the sunshine, with her lace cushion on her lap, flung her bobbins hither and thither with a sure and swift motion, and sang merrily over her work, which still went on, though she sent her eyes roving up and down the road, and nodded or called to neighbours as they passed.

She picked up her cushion, and set to work to rearrange her entangled threads and dis ordered bobbins. Presently she broke the silence with a light laugh. \"Much good he hath done himsen.

Or, so long as the summer lingered, and Mr. Webb and his friends smoked their long clay pipes and discoursed together in the open garden, he might be found leaning against one of the wooden pillars in the shadow of the overhanging building, listening to the words of wisdom which fell from their lips, for _Mr. Webb was rarely known to indulge in idle chat, or to discuss politics. But his foot never lingered before Dolly's door ; he was never more caught standing on tiptoe to peer through the heart-shaped aper tures in the black shutters, and though he had in some sort renovated his outer garb 'ong before the Goose Fair, he went to meeting, or gave his arm to Mr. Webb in riverside or forest rambles, but he passed pretty Dolly with a nod and nothing more. It so happened that William's deferential respect towards Mr. Webb, whom he regarded"], [85, "PETER WEBB'S PREDICTION. 73 as the embodiment of historic and topographic lore, had kindled an almost paternal affection in the lonely man's breast, whilst on the other hand his care for the neglected youth's bodily weal as well as his mental, shown especially during his sharp attack of ague, had touched the innermost chords of a sensitive heart. He treated William henceforth as a son, and he who had so little experience of fatherly care returned it with all a good son's rever ence and devotion. A bond of mutual attachment and, in some sort, confidence was formed, strengthened by sharing the same apartment. Little thought Mrs. George Hutton, when as a concession to her quiet lodger's age, infirm ities, and regular payments, she conceded the right to burn a nightly rushlight, it would serve her undervalued nephew to make ac quaintance with the insides of Mr. Webb's few books, as well as of others borrowed for his use by the old gentleman from his friend Dr. Deering. George Hutton, for a small manufacturer of the period, was not an illiterate man. He was a fair historian, and was not without books, but Mrs. George took care they should not spoil with too much use. She dubbed William a \" bookworm \" as a reproach, accused him of \" wasting time and eyesight in reading ; \" but"], [86, "74 IN HIS OWN HAND. that he should supplement his proper day's labour with an early half hour's study when daylight served, and steal another hour from sleep before midnight was a degree of mad ness she never suspected. Her philosophy had not mastered the fact that frame-knitting was to him drudgery, the pursuit of knowledge pure recreation. As little did Dolly Parker suspect that when she accosted William Hutton on the way from the apothecary's, that she reminded his self-constituted guardian of the \" Godless wench,\" of whom Mrs. Hutton had spoken so slightingly. Or, that before many weeks had gone by, William would leave his book unread whilst under cover of the night shadows, he opened his heart to his sleepless companion, and confiding his infatuation also admitted that Dolly Parker's taunt had done more to drive him away than his uncle's broom-stick ; and that he couldn't forget it. \" And pray don't forget it,\" advised the old man seriously from his pillow. \" A young girl who could so exult in the cruel punish ment of a fellow-creature must have a hard heart, whatever her beauty, a doubly hard one, if, as you say, she was aware of j'our dumb admiration.

The same excuse will not serve for a stinging tongue.\" And the speaker ground his teeth as if some old grievance stirred his speech. \" Indeed, sir, it seemed to turn my very heart round in spite of her pretty face,\" answered Will, with another heavy sigh. \" But she is very pretty.\" \" Pretty faces fade, but sharp tongues sharpen with use, and woe to the husband when the wife's tongue is sharpened on a stony or jealous heart.

She loved me well though she had a fiery spirit, and I adored her all the more for that which I lacked. But the day came when a word too much stung me to madness. In my insane exasperation I took an oath, a fear ful oath in my soul's despite, that she should never see my face again living or dead. I broke all links, all ties, and oh, my God ! the agony of remorse when passion was spent, and only my rash oath remained. What it cost to keep it, or how it was kept I may not tell.

This partial revelation of Mr. Webb's secret, made as it were to enforce a life lesson, took firm hold of William, and fortified him to avoid temptation in the guise of pretty Dolly. And so it was he kept out of her way through the weeks and months as seasons came and went, and she in passing could hear him singing at his grating frame as blithely as she had sung over her lace cushion, but his songs were oft impromptu rhymes set to old tunes. The taunts of Roper no longer affected him ; nay, they turned in time to blustering reproaches that Will was coming between him self and the lass, then succeeded vituperative anathemas of her and her sex generally, which led to the conclusion that the pair had quar relled, and that the big blusterer had become jealous of the other when rivalry had really ceased. The explanation came in time. But before that came about Roper had disappeared."], [90, "78 72V HIS OWN HAND. His ill-humour had caused him from time to time to spoil the stockings in his frame ; snap- ping the worsted with sudden jerks, forgetting to narrow, knitting uneven webs, too loose or too close in patches ; thus bringing on himself censure he was ill-disposed to brook. Mr. Webb had gone away as usual, during the week of the races. As usual he hired a quiet cob at the Blackmoor's Head in Long Row in the early morning, and turning its head out of die Market Place pursued his customary way up what is now Sherwood Street, north- ward through Thorneywood, a grave old man with lines of care and trouble in the face shaded from the sun or prying eyes by one loosened flap of his three-cornered hat. His black suit, conspicuous among the drabs and browns, blues and greens in ordinary wear, in its rustiness suggested the wearer to be a poor vicar or schoolmaster taking advantage of the holiday season to visit distant friends. How otherwise could the country people coming noisily into the town for the races in parties of eight or ten account for his entering the forest, and \u2014 passing the race course on his left with never a glance \u2014 turning his back on jollity and merriment, for a solitary ride through the lovely glades and shades of sylvan Sherwood. In some remote country places people meet\""], [91, "PETER WEBB '8 PREDICTION. 79 ing strangers in the lanes and byeways still salute them with a hearty \"good day\" in passing. Thirty years ago it was a common custom in the north, and farther back still in this century and last rustics did not scruple to accost a stranger with questions anent his destination, business, or the news of the day, meaning no harm, good souls, but merely to sill the vacuum in empty lives. So one or another race-goer hailed Peter Webb as he jogged along what has been for more than a hundred years the direct high way to Mansfield. It was then little more than a rude track in the sandy soil, worn into deep ruts by the carrier's waggon, an occa sional farmer's cart, or the infrequent roll of a travelling carriage to or from Bestwood, Newstead, or other forest mansions, and originally beaten down by the hoofs of pack horses or private travellers' steeds, and by the feet of shepherds and their flocks, foresters, farm labourers, gipsies and other pedestrians into a recognized road, but it was by no means a well-regulated continuous highway even twenty years later. What the byeways strik ing right and left to manors or villages must have been may be inferred. Here and there individuals for private convenience rid their land of stones turned up by the ploughshare to fill axle-deep ruts and hollows in their own"], [92, "80 IN HIS OWN HAND. vicinitj*\", but miles of less frequented road were left to traffic, chance, and the weather. Here the track led through open and verdu rous glades where the wild deer stood with bold front to question the intruder, there under the shade of over-arching trees the patriarchs of the woods, then through a ferny brake or bosky thicket, where might lurk bipeds to be dreaded more than the antlered deer. And though poachers and deer-stealers sought their prey by night there were always footpads to be feared by the solitary horse man who had a purse, a watch, or a steed to lose. People bent on honest business com monly sought companionship by the way for protection, and so Peter Webb, travelling alone into the forest, attracted attention. But whether he was asked if he was bound for Arnold, or Woodborough, or Arnfield, or Calverton, or Worksop, or Mansfield, he simply bowed his head with a courteous \" No, friend,\" without change of feature, or the pace of his steady roadster. Five miles and a half from Nottingham he left the direct track for a bridle path trending towards the north-east, so little frequented that in three or four miles he encountered only a single individual. This was a remarkably tall young man, tolerably well-dressed in a jaunty rustic suit of bottle-green velveteen, with a falling white"], [93, "PETER WEBB'S PREDICTION. 81 necktie, which, strangely enough for one of his apparent condition, was edged with lace. He carried a stout blackthorn stick in one hand, and with this he beat the bushes right and left, scaring the thrushes and the black birds from their nests, and sending leaves and twigs flying and fluttering after them. At last, as the horseman and he neared each other he sent the knotted stick with a raking sweep through a bramble bush, and out across the narrow path two or three callow nestlings were hurled along with moss and twigs, rotten wood and hay that had one moment before been a snug and comfortable home. And whilst the mother bird with broken wing hopped pitiably from spray to spray with troubled and affrighted cries, and her mate came flying swiftly home to join in lamentation, the reckless young brute set up a triumphant shout and laughed as if he had done a glorious deed. Involuntarily Mr. Webb checked his horse. \" Young man,\" said he gravely, \" can you find no better pastime than the wanton destruction of a happy home ? \" \" It's only a blackbird's nest,\" growled the destroyer, as if resenting interference. \" It was the birds' home, young man. There they hoped to rear the fledglings your idle recklessness has flung out to die.\" vol. i. 6"], [94, "82 IN HIS OWN HAND. \" Did ever any one hear such a pother over a bird's nest and brood,\" cried the fellow with a derisive laugh. \" Home is a sacred place, and life is sacred, whether it belong to bird, or beast, or man, and woe to him who breaks into one or the other for idle sport. Hark ! how the parent birds are wailing for their dying chicks. Have you no heart to feel for them ? \" was asked. The young man gripped his stick and scowled till his thick black brows met. \" Are you a parson or a schoolmaster, that you preach to one so glibly. Had I knocked you from your perch you could hardly have made more outcry.\" \" Perhaps less,\" answered the old gentleman solemnly, \" for I have no home, and my life is near its end. But, mark me, young man, the time may come when you may know all that is meant by a ruined home and a desolate heart, and then you may realize what these poor birds must suffer.\" So saying, he gave his horse a hint to go forward. The other blocked the way and caught the bridle. \" Harkee, sir ! \" cried he viciously. \" It's ill setting hot blood to boil.

Cruelty is a sure stepping-stone to the gallows.\" A touch of the spurs as he spoke sent on the astonished cob at a quickened pace as the young man called Francis Field dropped the bridle and recoiled, alike at the stranger's familiar utterance of his name and the pro phetic ring of his warning voice. Ere he recovered from his blank amaze ment, Peter Webb's beast had splashed through a shallow stream called Dover Beck, the forest boundary which crossed the road close at hand, and was off at a good round trot to Oxton and the open country, less than a mile awaj\\ The threats and anathemas of the schoolmaster's son were therefore unheard.

And yet it wanted an hour of noon, and grey clouds flecked the blue ether to temper the rays of the noonday sun. Moreover, lie kept his hat well down upon his brow whilst he feasted frugally on bread and cheese and a horn of ale, and checked the gossip of the podgy land lord with his own taciturnitv. Mine host was not so easily repressed. He was full of a great wedding there had been in Oxton Church the day before, between Miss West, of West Hall, and her cousin, Squire West of Westhorpe, and would not spare his customer a single detail, from the bride's sacque of white satin and stomacher laced with silver, to the sky-blue velvet coat and satin breeches of the bridegroom, her tower ing head dress, his powdered peruke, his sword and her jewels, the very buckles iu their shoes, the numerous guests, the festivities to follow, which were to last a week. Nay, so full was he of his unwonted budget of news, that he failed to observe the traveller's want of appetite, or the tremor that shook his aged hands as he sat and listened with never a word to indicate attention. It could scarcely be to see how the villagers had garlanded the little church for the occa-"], [97, "PETER WEBB 'S PREDICTION. 85 sion, that Peter Webb bent his steps thither, for he went no farther than a flat tombstone raised in the churchyard under an ancient yew tree to the memory of \u2014 a woman. There he bowed his head, and kneeling down with clasped hands seemed to pour forth his whole soui in sobs of contrite agony. And ere he turned away he kissed the four year-old inscription on the stone, and left behind a fresh sprig of rue he had brought with him. Yet it may be the landlord's wedding gossip had not fallen on deaf ears. When the horse man was again upon the high road with his face towards Southwell, he turned off sharply to his left, down a winding and sequestered lane. There bean and clover fields on either hand scarcely overpowered the scent of nettles and sweetbriar on the wild banks, and the tall fox-gloves nodded to him as he passed on to reach a noble avenue of splendid beeches extending right and left, only to look upon the ancient edifice they called West Hall, a picturesque specimen of black and white tim ber and rubble architecture, all nooks and angles, gables and pinnacles, nailstudded doors, and small-paned mullioned windows. His eyes were humid as he stopped and gazed upon it, and marked through open doors and casements the merry doings within, the"], [98, "86 IN HIS OWN HAND. bustle of servants and others coming and going, and ere he turned away invoked an in voluntary blessing on the wedded pair. What were th^se weddingers to him ? The afternoon was pretty well advanced when, having made another detour to Westhorpe, again to gaze like an antiquary on an old house front, he slowly entered Southwell. There his horse, as if he knew his dutj-, stopped at the office of Bulwell and Son, attorneys-at-law, where the specklessness of windows and paint seemed to vouch for integrity and respectability. Out came a dapper black-coated gentleman, with spotless cambric neckcloth and ruflles, a few years younger than the caller. Bows were exchanged, and a few brief words, an appointment was made for the morrow ; and then Peter Webb went wearity and sadly on to put up at the then King's Arms, where tradition said the saddest of England's sad monarchs had in his need taken shelter. And there must Mr. Webb be left with his secrets and his sorrows."], [99, "CHAPTER VII. BROKEN BONDS. During the race week that year Will was not kept a closer prisoner than the rest. But he had less care to go abroad, having nothing better than his old coat to show off in ; and had less hankering after Dolly Parker. With the perversity ascribed to her sex, as he retreated so did she seem disposed to advance, smiling, nodding, speaking to him whenever they chanced to meet, however cold might be his response. On his part he could not help contrasting her with his modest and retiring sister Cathe rine, who had kept an impatient lover at bay for many years. As was then customary on such occasions the recruiting sergeant and his satellites had been busy during the holiday week. The bom-bom of the drum and the shrill toot-toot toot of the fife had floated in the air over tree tops and houses from lanes and rows above or below the level, as they paraded hither and thither, now away on the racecourse, anon in"], [100, "88 IN HIS WN HAXD. the open Market Place, wherever there was a crowd to gape or a chance of snapping up idle or ill -fed rustics and journeymen. At their chief rendezvous, the Malt Cross, was their ally, the tapster from the Bell in Angel Row with ale in frothing measures for whomsoever would, and there also, mounted on the steps of the cross, was a piper to play for whom soever would dance to his piping. Being market-day, there were country lads and lasses ready enough to dance, for, as the cunning sergeant well knew it was round about the light and airy many-pillared Malt Cross, and in front of the cross-barred gates, of the old black and white four-gabled Town Hall just beyond, that labourers and others wanting employment congregated to be hired. And as he knew equally well that drink and lasses did half his business, he jingled the shillings in his pockets, handed about the ale, and clapped his applauding hands as they footed it right merrily to the pipe and drum, the most jovial and appreciative of entertainers; whilst the market people, selling their wares in the spacious area or waiting for customers, kept time to the tunes with feet or with nod ding heads. Music had ever a fascination for William. Not long before he had given half-a-crown of his hard earnings for an old instrument called"], [101, "BROKEN BONDS. 89 a bell-harp, out of which he strove to evoke harmony; and the hope of catching a new tune drew him towards the crowd between the Malt Cross and the Town Hall. The latter building comprised also the gaol, and overlooked with small windows and vertically striped front the long Market Place from its upper and wider end, as if to over-awe the traders and others with suggestions of stripes and imprisonment awaiting evil doers, even though the cucking-stool and pillory had dis appeared from its immediate neighbourhood. Roper and Dolly Parker were there before him. The former doing his rough best to set matters straight with her, had half persuaded her to join the ring of dancers with him. He held her hand in his, and she had taken a step or two forward, when she espied William Hutton not many paces away. At once she withdrew her hand, refused to dance, and when he became importunate, and pressed for a reason, betook herself to the side of his once-upon-a-time rival, with a toss of the head and a mere \"I've changed my mind.\" She greeted William with a smile, asked if he had been to the races ? How he spent the week ? If that was him she had heard playing music so delightfully ? If he liked dancing? Then she vowed she was vastly fond of a"], [102, "IX HIS OWN HAND. 90 round or a reel, and gave him clearly to un derstand that although she had refused to dance with Roper, she would be ready to join hands with him for a partner. It was a critical moment for the young man. It would be a fine opportunity to turn the tables on Roper. She looked wonderfully attractive in her straw hat and pink ribbons, her sky-blue gingham gown and white ker chief. For a moment he stood hesitating between temptation and resolution. He was on the very point of surrender. At that moment she turned her head and cast on his mortified fellow-apprentice a quick glance of exultant derision. William had seen that expression on her face once before, and he drew back involuntarity \u2014 the charm broken. The action was, however, unseen by Roper, who, in a towering rage, plucked her away with a rude jerk, and clenching his big fist in William's face, with a tremendous oath, swore, vindictively, \"I'll have my revenge on you, Bill Hutton, for coming between me and my sweetheart. Aye, if I wait fifty years for it.\" There were those in the crowd who would have urged on a fight between the two, of whom the busiest was the young fellow Mr. Webb had encountered in the forest, and addressed as Francis Field."], [103, "BROKEN BONDS. 91 But neither William nor the blusterer were of pugilistic mettle, the latter was coward as well as bully ; the former, though strong to endure, had no spontaneous courage and was not likely to fight for one unworthy his regard. With a mere \" Take her, and welcome ! \" he edged his way out of the press, and left jealous Roper and indignant Dolly to adjust their differences without him. This was not an amicable process, for when William was gone, Dolly turned coquettishly to Francis Field, and seemed more disposed to dance and laugh with him than to listen to the jealous speeches of Roper. Be sure the wide-awake sergeant kept his keen eyes on the three. That night the military detachment, with out communicating the secret of route or destination, marched out of Nottingham, across the meadows, over many-arched Trent Bridge, along the London Road, with a string of drunken recruits in tow, and Joseph Roper made one of the uproarious squad. It was almost midnight before he was missed ; morning before his enlistment was a certainty. It was then too late to follow, and George Hutton had to smother his chagrin, and make the best of his loss. Little use was it then to remember that whenever"], [104, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 92 Roper had been out of humour he had threatened to enlist. Of course Mrs. Hutton laid the blame on William for making mischief between Roper and his sweetheart, and having set him a bad example, and when there was no chance of overtaking or recovering him, she lamented the loss of the \" willing lad \" who was always ready to fetch or carry for her ; and seemed unconscious that Roper had been glad of any excuse to quit the monotonous frame, even had he not been rewarded for subservience alike with praise and pudding. George Hutton's passion soon cooled, he said that \" Roper had never been worth his salt as a frame-knitter. His two years teach ing had been almost thrown away. It was a loss trulv, but might have been worse.\" His de parture was a matter for unanimous rejoicing amongst the remaining apprentices to whom Roper had been a 'thorn in the flesh,' but there was not one who dared hint his satisfaction. Before the commotion created by his dis appearance had subsided Mr. Webb returned, and cast his opinion into the scale. \"You are well rid of the lout, Mr. Hutton, he was a dangerous and mischievous inmate. I hope he will never have a chance to keep his evil threat. Small minds like his find only room to harbour grudges.\""], [105, "BROKEN BONDS. 93 It was Monday evening. The lads were preparing to go out. George Hutton sat puffing away at his pipe in a corner of the bright settle, meditat ing how and where to replace the lost hand now that trade was so slack, for on the number of his apprentices depended a stoek inger's chief profit. Occasionally he ex changed a word with his saving wife, then seaming up a parcel of newly knitted stock ings to save employing a trade seamer. She had been holding forth on the general depravity of lads, who \" thought it no dis honesty to eat their employer's victuals, and rob him of his due by idleness and care lessness.\" Presently Mr. Webb, who looked as if he wanted quiet and repose after his journey, dipped his slender hand into a big pocket and drew forth a black pocket-book, which he opened, and handed to Will a slip of paper. \" Read that aloud, Will, for the benefit of the company,\" he said, \" I copied it years ago from a tablet in an old church tower, not many miles away, I think at a place called Cotgrave.\" Will took the paper, and read out, not without hesitation, and a rising colour. \" King Charles's Rules.\""], [106, "94 IN HIS OWX HAXD. (\" Of blessed memory ! \" put in the old gentleman, whether referring to the king or to the rules was not clear. It might be both.) William proceeded, \" Profane no divine ordinances : Touch no State matters : Urge no healths : Pick no quarrels : Maintain no ill opinions : Encourage no vice : Repeat no old grievances : Reveal no secrets : Make no comparisons : Keep no bad company : Make no long meals : Lay no wagers : Do nothing in anger.\" Mr. Webb sighed as the last words were read, and the smoker shook the ashes from his, pipe before he remarked, \" Good rules those, whoever made them.\" \" Aye,\" said Mr. Webb, \" rules for subjects to ponder as well as kings. Get your copy book, Will, and write them down in your best round hand, to be hung up in the work room, for the use of all who have need of them, young or old.\" Mrs. Hutton muttered something about \"Jacobite meddling,\" as Will rose to obey, but it was under her breath.

To do this he must mend his pen, and for"], [107, "BROKEX BOXDS. 95 this Mr. Webb's knife was requisitioned. When \" King Charles's Rules \" were duly put to paper with the addition of the word *' golden \" at the old gentleman's request, and when he and George Hutton had ex pressed their approval of the calligraphy, William handed back the curious and coveted knife to its owner. For once, he did not take it back. \" Nay, William,\" said he, \" my writing days are well-nigh over. If I want a pen you can make it for me. You can put the knife in your pocket as a keepsake from me now, without waiting until I am dead. It will be useful to you, and may keep me in your memory when I am laid to rest \u2014 and I care not how soon that may be,\" he added in a lower kev. \" Knives cut love,\" suggested Mrs. Hutton, not pleasantly. The old man started up in his chair, grasp ing its arms with both his hands, his thin lips white and quivering. Almost fiercely he cried out, \" Aye, mistress, they do, I needed no reminder with that knife before me. That was a love gift. Put it out of sight, Will, and give it not away. Love is gone- \u2014 and life is going; why should I keep it longer ? \" Then he sank back in his chair, and there was silence, Was it not prevision?"], [108, "96 IN HIS OWN HAND. Beyond that temporary silence no note was taken of the vehement ejaculation or the exhaustion that followed. This was in a measure due to the extreme discomposure of the stockinger and his wife over the empty frame in the work-room and the empty stool in the kitchen, both so abruptly vacated. The question how to fill the former profit ably without paying journeyman's wages (a sine-qua-non with the parsimonious wife) so occupied and engrossed their considera tion for the succeeding day or two, that they were totally blind to the signs of another departure involving a still greater loss \u2014 to no one greater than to William. In their pre-occupation they had failed to note the marked change in Mr. Webb since his late return home. Even his casual com plaint of restless nights and a fluttering at his heart scarcely drew forth a comment from Mrs. Hutton. William was not so oblivious ; he saw how feebly the old gentleman mounted the stairs at night, how willingly he accepted assistance to undress or dress, and how often his hand went to his side, when his face would contract as with a sharp spasm. \" You had better see the apothecary, sir, I am sure you are very ill,\" urged the young"], [109, "BROKEN BONDS. 97 man the night following the presentation of the silver knife. \" Oh, I may be better in a day or two.

Could not some one do your business for you ? \" How keen a glance was that the feeble man shot at Will with the words, \" My business, what do you know of my business ? What is known of me or of my business ? \" \" Nothing, sir, and I meant no intrusion.\" Will apologized. \" Well, well, perhaps not.\" And closing the conversation he lay down, but not to rest. The next night passed, and the next came ; the ascent of the stairs tried him greatly. He sat down gasping on a box near the door, with his hand as usual on his side. Presently he said, \" I'm not partial to doctors or their potions, but I think I shall take your advice, William, and see one in the morning if I am not better.\" Then, as William helped him into bed, and adjusted his pillows, he gasped out, \" Thank you, my boy, for your kindness to an old man.

Good-night, and God bless you ! \" His voice had been low, and his speech had been broken by pauses, which Will attri buted to shortness of breath consequent on the effort to get into bed. He returned the \" good-night \" with smiling thanks for pro mises which he regarded as chimerical, and lay down on his own pallet, wondering if the poor old man's mind was wandering. In the middle of the night he was startled out of sleep by a strange sharp cry like to nothing he had ever heard. He had been early trained to rise on the instant with his senses awake, and in another minute he had his arms round his aged friend, who was sitting up in bed with both hands on his side, his ashen face distorted with agony. His \" Oh, sir, what can 1 do for you ? \" was answered with a gasping and faint, \" Doctor ! Quick ! \" Will made a sudden rush to rouse his brother, waken his uncle and aunt, bid Tom run for Doctor Deering. He was not away more than three minutes. He found Mr. Webb sunk back on the pillows with a strange yearning expression in his"], [111, "BROKEN BONDS. 99 eyes, his breath laboured, his lips apart and quivering. Trembling with his own fears Will raised him tenderly, and laid the bald head against his own shoulder. He thought his aunt and uncle would never come. He saw that some one was coming, coming uncalled for and unsought, and he was afraid. His fears almost overtopped his anguish. There was a terrible struggle for speech, the straining eyes proclained it \u2014 \" Going ! \u2014 oh, God! \u2014 secret \u2014 my name- \u2014 Phil \u2014 bury with my \" And that was the last articulate word of the man known as Peter Webb. When George Hutton, half-dressed, reached the attic-chamber with his wife behind him, there was a painful movement of the blue lips, but not a sound audible to human ears. Terrible spasms convulsed limbs and fealures, and the brandy with which Mrs. Hutton wetted his lips availed nothing. The dving man seemed to fight with death for utterance \u2014 for power to break the seal of silence held intact too long. In vain.

A student in heraldry might have found a clue in the engraved seal-ring of the dead man which Mrs. Hutton so coolly appro priated, but to her and hers there was no symbolism in the setting sun it bore. And though the fragmentary utterances of the dying gentleman often recurred to the impressionable mind of the young fellow whose \" fortune \" he had promised to make, his aunt had taken him so sharply to task for \" heeding the ravings of a man dying and off his head,\" that he kept to himself all former revelations.

They had long been treasures to him as foun tains of knowledge, but now the books had become more than that \u2014 they were property, something to possess and call his own.

If study languished he found a refuge and a solace for his melancholy in music, that outlet for the woes of half the Nottingham apprentices. He had a fine ear, but neither books nor master, so it mattered not to him whether he played indoors or out, in the dark or the light, and when he picked up a tune he found words of his own come readily as he carolled lustily at his frame. In fact he had taken his uncle's sharp lesson to heart, and whatsoever he undertook he \"did"], [116, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 104 it with his might,\" whether at the stocking frame, the jingling bell-harp, or the athletics he practised with Martin and others in the meadows by the riverside. (Commerce coveted those meadows long ago, good reader, and covered them and their crocuses with wharves and warehouses. Nottingham, like other manufacturing towns, has far out grown the limit trod by William Hutton and his confreres.) He had pasted \" King Charles's Golden Rules \" on a board, and hung it up in the work-room: Some one, either aunt or uncle, added thereto, \" The hand of the diligent maketh rich.\" \" I say, Thomas,\" he said with a jog of his stolid brother's elbow the first time he ob served the addendum, \"Is our diligence to make uncle rich or ourselves ? \" \"Both, maybe,\" quoth Thomas, and he set his frame in motion without another word. In practical exemplification of the text William in another year again blossomed forth a beau in a small way.

He was as ready to scrub a floor for his aunt as to knit a stocking, and asked no more recreation than a book in a chimney corner, or under one of the oaks in Sherwood Forest.

For a moment he looked at her abashed and confounded. Had the crater of a volcano opened beneath his feet he could scarcely have been more dismayed. \" Why don't j'ou speak ? \" said she. \" Better be silent than speak folly,\" was his sober reply. \"You're for jumping the hedge without thought for the ditch ; a woman should wait till she's asked; and I shall ask no girl to wed till I'm my own master, and can keep a comfortable home over a wife's head, and save something besides.

Dolly lived to rue her impatience. She had taken good care to let her recalcitrant swain learn that \" she had more than one string to her bow.\" Thomas, who had no finery to air on the promenade of the Long Pavement, or to tempt footpads elsewhere, was wont to take a book and a stroll into the quiet shades of Sherwood Forest on Sunday afternoons. There, more than once or twice during that summer, he came across Dolly Parker, all smiles and dimples, leaning on the arm of a tall, black-browed young fellow, whose laced neckcloth seemed a token of her favour. She was sure to give easy-going Thomas a nod of recognition in passing, which seemed to challenge a report in Woolpack Lane. She did not stop at that.

Rumour had been busy with her name for some time, and when William Hutton put on his warm consolatory coat at the Goose Fair, the glass-blower was breaking up his house. His eighteen-year-old daughter had left him to marry a schoolmaster's son at Southwell. But he did not seem proud of the match, and was heard in his cups \u2014 glass-blowing is a thirsty occupation \u2014 to call his new son-in-law \" A lazy, thriftless wastrel, with all his learn ing and his Latin.\" Mrs. Hutton had very speedily replaced her dead lodger with a young whip-maker, as lithe as the goods he made there by his own bedside ; and to him she was exceptionally gracious. She was much less gracious to the occu pants of the back attic, where William again slept along with three other apprentices, his little brother Samuel now being one. But no sly Roper was there to make mischief, and the three brothers could keep peace with their other companion. In two more years manhood broke the bonds of William's apprenticeship.

His wages were poor, and his parsimonious aunt, fair-faced as she was to her new lodger, yet grudged the food he and his brothers ate, and worked for. The very creaking and croaking of his frame irritated him. He was getting into debt. He felt he was labouring only for others profit, and he ceased to sing as he knitted away. \" Fourteen years of my life gone for no thing! Two apprenticeships served, two trades learned and not a living to be got at either ! \" seemed to be the incessant wail of his frame, the echo of his own pain. \" I'll be my own master, hire a frame, and work for the warehouses,\" was the outcome of his brooding. Straightway he sought per mission to set up a frame in his uncle's work room, where was ample space. \" Aye, aye, my lad, and welcome. It's only fair to let thee have a start,\" was George Hutton's ready assent. William introduced the subject the next day. He was then answered moodily, \" I've thought better of it.

Trade might well be at a standstill, for the heart of England was disquieted by another Jacobite rising. Nay, the young Pretender had marched as far as Derby, on his way to Finchley, and if London quaked in its many shoes, Nottingham was not likely to feel com posed. Fugitives from Derby flocked thither in shoals to spread dismay, only to be followed by glad tidings of the rebels' retreat. Back went the fugitives, and amongst other curious folk went William Hutton, more troubled about his father than ever that father had been about him. Of course he found Derby all in commotion. Not a familiar nook or corner but held some one with something to tell, and all went into one of the niches of that wonderful cabinet he called his memory, there to lie quiescent like the forgotten papers in the old oak desk, waiting the hand that should draw them forth. \""], [124, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 112 For the coincident and startling family intel ligence which met him almost as soon as he had crossed the bridge he was not prepared. Yet it was a pivot on which his life would turn, \u2014 aye, and sway the destinies of greater folk, the far-off and unknown. About two years previously his father had wisely married a prudent widow having a comfortable home. Here he found him, all excitement, but neither with ale nor popular frenzy. Perkins, the little tailor and parish clerk of Swithland, in Leicestershire, who had courted Catherine Hutton from the time she was a girl of twelve in the house of her shopkeeping aunts, had, along with half-a-dozen rebel soldiers, invaded the peaceful sanctuary the woolcomber now called his home and created as great a panic as the Jacobites. His daughter Catherine was supposed to be serving as housekeeper to a pious Presbyterian minister at Gainsborough, where she had been for many years. Nothing ofthe kind. Shehad been Catherine Perkins for two years unknown to them all. But the little clerk had not made the journey to Derby in midwinter, when the roads were alive with rebels, onty to tell his father-in-law that. It appeared that Catherine \u2014 who was a"], [125, "FREEDOM. 113 well-formed, handsome young woman, albeit she had red hair \u2014 owned a will and opinions as strong and decided as the maiden aunts at Swithland, who had reared and educated her from childhood, and that although she had been induced to marry in private so long back, it was not until her husband made a solemn promise to throw up his clerkship and remove from Swithland, that she had consented to quit the good master she had served so long, and take up her abode with her master by marriage. Three months had gone by. The promise made in August had not been fulfilled in December, and now Catherine, without choos ing to render a reason, insisted that if her husband would not leave Swithland, she would leave him. The little clerk had come with his grievance to implore his father-in-law's intercession ; and he, after the first lamentations over the secret marriage, was as lugubrious and dolorous about the domestic \" rebellion \" of Catherine, as if he had been the best of fathers, who, after mating a daughter to his heart's content and her advancement, found all his care defeated. William left his father to his lamentations, and trudged back to Nottingham through rain and slush, more troubled about his dearly loved sister than any doings of the Jacobites.

Be hind him, on a pillion, sat a little maiden, protected from the weather by a thick riding coat and a contrivance of oilskin and whale bone called a calesh, which enveloped head and bonnet both, and defied rain. William had a fair view of her face in passing, and of a golden tress or two blown by the wind. At once his thoughts went back to the little fairy whose hat he had rescued from Markeaton brook, and wondered if this was a younger sister. She could not be the same. Sally Cox would surely have grown more in four years.\" He turned his head and looked back to see her looking after him with a puzzled expres sion in her bright eyes. \" I do believe she is the same.

George Hutton, puffing away at his pipe, pronounced his opinion, \" Being a dissenter, no doubt she feels uneasy in her mind as the wife of a parish clerk, and, as a point of con science, wishes him to resign.\" \" Conscience, indeed! A consistent Presby terian would never have consented to marry a Churchman, let alone a clerk. She knew what he was beforehand, and must take the consequences,\" was the dictum of her Aunt Ann. But Catherine Perkins at the age of twenty seven was not disposed to take consequences as they came. She was more inclined to create consequences, to drive than to be driven. She might have absorbed the self will of the whole family in her own person. The little clerk and tailor was no match for her.

She soon put down discussion of her con duct. \" I am accountable to God only for my actions ; let no one interfere,\" was the law she laid down. And interference was of little use, for though she was followed in a few days by her husband, who offered to make a home for her close to her Uncle Ward's at Mountsorrel, there was no bridging the gulf between them. Her decision was final. He went back alone to Swithland. Whatever his offence she never rejoined him. The ill-wind that blew husband and wife apart, blew a scrap of good fortune into the lap of William ; at all events, satisfied his craving to be his own master.

The money was lent, not given. \" Every shilling I have was got together with honest work and self-denial, and 1 shall expect you to work hard to repay me some day,\" she said. \" I trust you to pay me back when you are able ; but I shall not hurry you.\" It was well he had not an urgent creditor, for if his uncle George, an old and well-known master stockinger, had difficulty in disposing of his wares, how was the new beginner to find customers ! He did not find his master ship as profitable as he expected. To save money was impossible. He could scarcely obtain a bare subsistence. Matters were anything but flourishing in the stocking trade. George Hutton had one loss after another, and every loss told on his wife's temper and his own health.

He had broken a blood-vessel. A few days of ignorant quackery, and the great change came."], [131, "CHAPTER IX. CATHERINE PERKINS. It was indeed a change. Before George Hutton had been laid to rest in the peaceful and silent house of night a couple of weeks, autocratic Catherine, taunted with having \" no home,\" had made a clear sweep of her self, her brothers, and their belongings out of the house in Woolpack Lane to a small thatched dwelling she had taken for herself in a spot called Bearward Lane, where two bears had once been kept in ward not far from the Bar (Bear) Gate. In so doing, she had placed fully half-a-mile between themselves and the sharp-tongued aunt, who was left to mourn over her self created desolation to her only remaining lodger, Robert Tanner, the young whip- maker, and to console herself as best she might. In common with most men of the period who had occasion to face the perils of the roads between town and town with goods, or money in saddle-bags or pockets, George Hutton had left a will, and there was certainly"], [132, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 120 some little cash in Smith's bank, and it was over the adjustment of the dead man's affairs so as to secure the equitable reversion of his little property to Thomas and William at the widow's death that the two came into collision. Ann Hutton resented the interference of practical Catherine, at first with a whine, and then with acrid reflections on the memory of the dead will-maker and all his kin, and so she was left to settle her affairs at her own discretion \u2014 or indiscretion as it proved. Busy as bees had the three seceders been white washing and scrubbing the small house in Bearward Lane, before William's frame was taken down, and she began to realize what their defection meant. Thomas had been only his uncle's journeyman for more than a year, and was free to go whither he would, whilst Samuel and the other apprentice had taken to their heels in company before her days of widowhood. Energetic Catherine Perkins had not merely rented a house which she said she \" meant to make a home for them all,\" but she had already found a new master for steady, easy going Thomas, and drawn on her frugally hoarded savings for such furniture and utensils as were indispensable. And she took care that no time was lost before all were settled"], [133, "CATHERINE PERKINS. 121 and in working order, she leading and direct ing everything. She indicated the spot where William's frame was to stand on the smooth, hard, white plaster floor, close by the broad, low window for the light, and she bade Thomas help him to set it up, whilst she arranged matters in the house-place and elsewhere. A stout oaken coster had followed her by carrier from Mountsorrel, and after she had ranged their fair wooden platters and por ringers on a sort of bulk-head dresser, built in the house-wall, she dived into the coffer, aud without hesitation brought forth her store of linen spun and bleached by herself for a very different home, and a number of other articles for use or ornament, the gifts of masters and mistresses for faithful service. Their first meal in the new abode was merely bread and cheese (cheese at threepence per pound) ; but she had covered the three legged deal table with a whiter homespun cloth, and set a small earthenware mug of water by each platter, as an intimation of the order she intended to inaugurate.

Let us drink it and thank God for his gift.\" \" Aye, Catherine,\" put in William, \" if we only eat when we're hungry and drink when we're dry, we may do without ale and save the money. I seldom spend my pennies in pints.\" She saw them both taking a general survey as they placed their wooden stools at the round table. \" We are not crowded out with goods and chattels,\" she said, following their eyes, \" but chairs and tables do not make a home, neither do indolence and luxurious fare.

Besides,\" and again he glanced at the coffer, the platter-shelves, the mantel-board, \" evevy thing is fresh, clean, and wholesome, and your handsome, smiling face, Catherine, is better than all the polished tables and bureaus, glass and china Aunt Ann hath not the heart to use. I have never before felt I had a home, and God bless you for this.\" \" So say I,\" added Thomas, with unwonted emphasis, as he cut away at the big brown loaf without fear of a rebuke. And so, with good appetites, and love for seasoning, they made a banquet of their bread and cheese. So Catherine Perkins created for her long-tried brothers a home, of which she was to be the dominant head. Not with a profusion of worldly goods, not with a pros pect of luxurious ease ; but with a firm hand and a clear head, strong determination, abun dant faith and a basis of self-denial.

The golden September sun shone in their hopeful faces as they took an afternoon stroll together, round by the foot of Castle Hill to the green meadows and willow-shaded banks of the Leen, to turn aside to the great red rock and go in and out of the curiously excavated caverns underneath the farther hill, speculating as they went whether monkish hands indeed had dug out those cloistered aisles. The morrow's sun had barely laid aside his misty morning veil before the porridge pot and porringers were cleaned out and put away.

Nor was there much time lost in the pre paration of meals, for though butcher's meat was only twopence-halfpenny a pound, and a stubble goose might be had for a shilling, earnings were in proportion, potatoes were still garden produce, and one day's cooking (meat and vegetables in the same pot), did duty for two or three dinners.

Frame-knitters had to compete with do mestic hand-knitters, for knitting was still the principal occupation of feminine (aye, and masculine) hands by the dim firelight of long winter evenings, in the country especially. Women, with pails or baskets on their heads, knitted as they went along. And the preju dice against machine wrought stockings was long in dying out. Then civil war had not tended to the prosperity of trade generally. William took his wares from one hosier's to another with very indifferent success. He was easily elated, easily depressed. At last he ventured with half-a-dozen hose to a Leicester dealer, walking all the way for lack of means to ride. The dealer declined to buy. Disappointed, William burst into tears.

William took them up, asked the price, and laid them down again as if reluctantly. \" It's no use,\" said he, \" I cannot afford to purchase well- bound books, and my sister sets her face against loose leaves littering about. If I had only a press I might try to bind them together myself, and the last I bought like wise.\" \" Why not buy my old press, you should have it cheap. It has done a lot of good work for me.

It would be dear firewood at that.\" \" And I don't choose to take it even for firewood.\" \" Then keep it and your loose scraps like wise,\" answered William, and turned to go. But the crafty Finch recollected that the press was only useless lumber. There was not the ghost of a chance that the stockinger could make it work if he could not, and coin in hand was better than lumber in his little shop. He called William Hutton back, offered to let him have it for two shillings, and declared there was a fortune in the press for one who could find it. \" If you thought so, Mr. Finch, my two shillings would not be taken in exchange,\" quoth William dryly. \" I am risking my money over it, I know.

He rebound some of his own books, and put them in the window as specimens with a conspicuous bill, \" Bookbinding done here.\" This progress was slow, but it was progress ; some individuals employed him because he worked cheaply, others for the mere novelty of finding a bookbinder and a stockinger in one. Now it was that having mastered the lower branches of the trade he began to feel the want of good lools for better class work. He had none but the old things he had bought years before from Mr. Finch, and none were to be procured nearer than London. The tanners in the Narrow Marsh could supply calf skin, but not coloured kid or morocco. He lamented this to Catherine, with the added remark, \" He sells me nothing but waste leather and boards, and now he has got Miss Finch there fancies he can charge what he pleases.\" \" Oh,\" thought Catherine, \" is the old fox laying a trap for my susceptible brother ? \" Her answer was prompt, \"Then go to London, and buy better.\""], [146, "AV HIS OWN HAND. 134 \" How can I go ?

A little sigh accompanied his acquiescence in the Avisdom of her advice, and he set his plum-coloured suit aside, though not without a twinge or two of mortified vanity \u2014 or, shall we say\u2014 self-respect. Downstairs there was a good mess of smok ing milk porridge awaiting him. A package of cheese and oaten cake to eat by the way was thrust into one big pocket; a clean shirt and stockings filled the other. Thomas had been aroused and joined them, and then she bade her brothers kneel down while she solemnly aud earnestly commended the traveller to the safe keeping of the Almighty. There followed an affectionate embrace, in which he left a tear upon her cheek, and then, stick in hand, he turned lo go ; Thomas bear ing him company as far as the toll-gate on the twenty-arched Trent Bridge, which spanned the stream and watery meadows both. John Taylor, the toll-man, had come down to open the gate for a carter in charge of a heavy millstone which had been all night on"], [149, "ON THE LONDON ROAD. 137 the road, and whilst taking his toll grumbled \u25a0O *_ and swore at the breaker of his repose. But when he raised his horn lantern to look into the Hustons' well-known faces, and heard that William was bound for London on foot, he set up a shout of dismay, and said he would \" surely be robbed and murdered before he came back.\" It was certainly a perilous and long journey. But William assumed a bravery he was far from feeling, and replied, \" I've neither coin nor clothes worth stealing ; I'm not quarrel some, and I don't drink. Footpads don't commit murder where there's no provocation, and nothing to gain.\" \"Brave words off a weak stomach, my man. Don't brag till you're out o' the wood!\" growled the toll-taker as he turned in. His words were not inspiriting. William's courage was shaken as well as his hand when Thomas bade him \" God be wi' you.\" The morning was dry if the roads were not ; and it was not so dark as to make his footing insecure on the highway.

Yet he carried about him quite sufficient to tempt robbery and violence even in these enlightened days, and its unwonted possession was not strengthening to a naturally timid disposi tion. Soon he lost his fears in the recollection of the former long journey he had undertaken and its different auspices. \" Ah ! it's nearly eight years since I ran away from Uncle George. Nay, from Dolly Parker and Aunt Ann. Not a penny in my pocket but the two shillings I had helped my self to. A pretty mess I made of it.

So long was it since he had been kept in practice by walking and racing with Martin in the Trent meadows, that now his feet were tender and blistering. No matter. The last bat had flown to its covert, day was dawning if chilly, the dusk of night was dispersing, he seemed to be leav ing it behind, there was a scent of burning peat or wood on the breeze, smoke rose here and there from cottage chimneys, the light grey eastern sky showed the first faint flush ings of pink and amber, there rose a wall of white mist between him and the distant land scape, above which showed ghost-like the tops of nearer bushes and trees in all the tender green of early spring, whence came a chirping and a twittering to say that the bird world was waking up, and there would be com panions for him on the road ere long. He felt as if a new day was also dawning for him ; and stepped resolutely on in spite of sore fatigue until he crossed the bridge at"], [152, "AV HIS OWN HAND. 140 Leicester and looked about him for an inn, where he might rest. Leicester was not altogether new to him. His uncle had put up his horse at the Three Crowns. And he was soon seated in the kitchen of the inn with a pint of ale before him, a thick oaten cake and half a cheese. To cut this he drew out his pocket knife without thinking how little it accorded with his dusty feet, his homety garb. Laying it down for a moment it caught the attention of the landlady, who made a remark about its peculiarity. \"It was a keepsake to me from an old gentleman who died in my arms,\" remarked William. \" I set great store by it.\" Half-an-hour's rest and he was again on the road, stepping out all the better for refresh ment, and spinning doggerel verses as he went. A mile or thereabouts beyond Leicester he overtook a man some years j'ounger than himself with his head bound up in an old rag, rather suggestively stained. The man who had bow legs and a shambling sort of gait, and discontented face, accosted him \u2014 \" Heaw fur are yo' goin' ? \" \" To London,\" was William's answer. \" So am oi,\" said the stranger. '\u2022When do you expect to arrive?\" then"], [153, "ON THE LONDON ROAD. 141 questioned William, taking stock of the other's appearance. \" On Wensday neet.\" \" So do I,\" said William in turn, adding \" What is the matter with your head ?

The suspected rogue put these fears to flight by the voluntary statement, \" Moi neame's Tommy Green, oi'm a tailor by trade, an' going to Lunnon to try my luck theere. Oi've had now't but ill-luck i' other parts. What trade are yo' ? \" William hesitated, \" I'm a frame-knitter and a bookbinder.\" he answered after a pause. \"Ho! ho! Yo' be lucky to ha' two trades.

At the end of half-an-hour the fighting tailor asked in breathless voice, \"Dun yo' meean to hold on at this rate ? \" \" Aye. It is best to use daylight while we have it.\" And on Will marched steadily, his blistered feet forgotten almost, in the self satisfied consciousness the tailor was no match for him in walking. In less than another half-hour they sighted the swinging sign of a wayside public-house. \" It's dommed hard work walkin' at this pace,\" quoth the tailor, \" come in and let's have a drink ! oi'm dead tired.\" \" Not I,\" cried Will, \" or I might share 3rour ill-luck,\" he added, as he left the thirsty particle of a man behind to wash down his fatigue in the ale can, well pleased to be rid of so disreputable a companion. He softened his refusal by saying over his shoulder, \" I shall be moving slowly, you will soon overtake me.\" \u2022 There was so little likelihood of that at the pace Will kept, that nine miles or so farther on he sat down by a wayside rippling brook to lave his feet and shake the dust and gravel from his shoes.

The strained sinews refused to do their office. He was lame. His shoes were burst and broken. The stockings he had put on new in London were in holes, his feet a mass of blisters. He had borne hunger, fatigue, pain heroi cally. At the contemplation of his position, lame and moneyless among strangers, his for titude forsook him and he wept bitterly. \" What would Catherine say if she saw me thus ? \" he asked himself. \" Aye, or that little Tommy Green, the tailor? But they shall neither of them say I gave in. What has to be borne must be borne.\" And in that frame of mind he took up his staff again after a few hours' rest. On Tuesday he was again in Leicester, and called at the Three Crowns to ask about his lost knife. To his surprise and gratification it was handed to him by the smiling landlady, with the remark, \" I knew the knife was yours, and a keep sake, and so I took care of it, quite sure you would be coming back some day.

Many a traveller has been waylaid and murdered for less.\" William thanked her, paid for his ale, and in the afternoon of that day the weary and wayworn adventurer who had been absent barely nine days in all, was seated by the side of his sister Catherine's wheel on their own hearth, with fourpence laid upon the table as a sort of trophy. The parcel of goods he had despatched on the Friday, just brought in lay on the window-seat full in his view, but his strength was gone ; he had no power or in clination to step across the floor and assure himself by inspection that his goods were all there and uninjured. His tender-hearted, if strong-minded sister knelt down on the white hearth, removed the dilapidated remains of his shoes and stockings, set his excoriated feet to soak in warm water, commending his frugality and endurance at the same time. Catherine's praises were as the breath of life to him, they sank into his soul ! His jaded frame they had no power to rouse. A hot bowl of savoury pease-porridge placed at his elbow remained untasted. Faint and hungry he was, but past eating, as he had been when he first landed at the"], [159, "ON THE LONDON ROAD. 147 Horns in Smithfield. His head drooped, his hands hung listlessly between his knees. \" Miss Finch inquired after you on Sunday,\" she said, partly to rouse him, partly as a feeler. \" Did she ? \" he answered, but never raised his head. \" You want a nice dish of tea and a rasher, and you shall have them, you need a fillip.\" She was unincumbered with the senseless hoop in common wear ; her movements were quick and rapid, but before his dish of tea was ready he had his \" fillip.\" It was a simple item of news that caused him to spring from his seat in breathless astonishment. \" Robert Tanner horsewhipped Aunt Ann last week. It is not the first time, Thomas says. And the bellman hath been going round the town to-day crying a sale of their 'goods and chattels' on next Saturday.\" \" Horsewhipped her ? A sale ? \" cried William as he bolted up on his bare feet. \" Uncle left the furniture to me and Thomas at aunt's death. They have no right to sell them. We must stop the sale.\" And he looked as if he would be off on the instant. \" The landlord sells for rent unpaid. We can do nothing. I have ascertained that.\" William sank down despondingly. \" No thing in that case,\" he sighed. \" Not even 10\u20142"], [160, "148 IN HIS OWN HAND. bid at the sale for uncle's books or his old desk. All my money is gone.\" Catherine poured out his tea into a small earthenware mug. The tiny handleless cups and saucers she had brought from Gains borough were too precious for common use, as was tea itself. But she made no remark. After a pause William broke out reflectively, \" I confess I should like to have the old desk for uncle's sake. It will fetch little or nothing at the sale. Ah ! that bandy-legged tailor I met on the road bade me look out for ill-luck, and here it is. But I'm not beaten. I'll see what I can earn before Saturday.\" And as if inspired with a new spirit to overcome a difficulty he tossed off his tea, and turned to the rasher beside it. Thomas came in. \" So you're back,\" said he composedly. \"Tired, no doubt.\" \" Tired, aye. A fine hearing this at my journey's end. All our property to be sold ! \" \"What we have never had we shall never miss,\" drawled out Thomas stoically. \" Aunt Ann will feel it worst.

It was only for that he married her. She is paying the penalty of her folly and blindness.\" \"It serves her right,\" put in Will, sternly. \"She had no pity for others, I have no pity for her. She was master in uncle's time. She hath found her master now. I warrant her tongue was sharp as his lash. Will the wheals on her skin make her think of me, or poor Sam, or of little Coates, or of our sore bones when we were thrashed at her under hand instigation ? She taunted atou, Catherine, with having 'no home;' and said my ague was a 'judgment' on me. Think you she will recall Mr. Webb's words now, and own this is a judgment on her? Sam overheard him rebuke her. Poor Sam ! I fear he hath gone to ruin. If he hath, it lieth at her door.\" \" Aye ! so the neighbours say now she's down,\" quoth Thomas dryly. \" There's not much pity stirring. There never is when folk come down who like her set up for saints.\""], [162, "AY HIS OWN HAND. 150 There was evidently not much compassion for her on that hearth, whatever there might be abroad. Not much compassion on the Saturday among the jocular crowd who took the polish off her bright furniture with rough handling, and appraised it and Mrs. Tanner much below her own estimate. The two Huttons felt themselves robbed of their own, and if the oak settle, cornered chair, best table, the bureau, and the coveted old oak desk were transferred to Bearward Lane that night, William grudged the golden guinea Catherine had laid down for the furniture if he did not the two shillings at which the desk became his. Not until his dead uncle's household pro perty came to the hammer was he sensible how much he had calculated on fitting up a home for himself and a wife with his own portion at some future day.

William's venturesome journej- had been noised abroad, and, taken in conjunction Avith the sale in Woolpack Lane, made him a man of some little importance beyond his own immediate circle. He was never better pleased than when telling a story of which himself was the hero ; so over and over again he recounted to different hearers various incidents of his journey, and his sight-seeing in the Metropolis, which have or have not a place in this narrative. A man who had seen so much in London with his own eyes and power of observation was a rarity. His travels brought him listeners, and some few intelligent customers among them, who had books with broken backs or loose magazines to be bound. Mr. Finch soon discovered he had good reason to dread a rival, but so long as William helped to clear off his unsaleable rubbish, and in furtherance of his own secret scheme for bringing a young and cheap assistant into"], [164, "152 AY HIS OWN HAND. his business, he begged him to let his Susannah hear this or that, and otherwise threw the girl, who was not ill-looking, into the 3roung man's way whenever practicable. So surely as he bought a fresh batch of old books he would despatch her from his shop in narrow Bridlesmith Gate to invite Mr. Hutton's inspection, or he would send a parcel of pamphlets or loose leaves for him to look over at his leisure ; nay many of Irs pretexts were much more frivolous. An agreeable girl and a good listener was \u25a0****: o t c sure to be welcome to William, whatever she might be to clear-eyed Catherine. As for unconscious Susannah, she went readily enough, glad of a change from the dusty, stuffy little shop, where the snuff-box of her father was brought out for every promising customer, and in opening and shutting benevolently titilated the nostrils of the bystanders. It was a pleasant little walk for her along the shady arcades of the Market Place, where bright red brick looked down in impertinent youth on aged timber and rubble, on to the smiling outskirts of the town, where the few dwellings in Bearward Lane looked out on sweetly scented fields and gardens, and on hedgerows redolent of hawthorn and honey suckle. True, there was a burial ground in the lane but that was a bower of green."], [165, "NEITHER SIGN NOR TOKEN. 153 Then every dwelling had its long plot of ground in the rear, and thrifty Catherine turned hers to good account. There were rows of cabbages and parsnips, peas and beans, herbs for the pot or physic, counting the sweet thyme and brilliant marigold, and (|uite a gay bed of flowers beneath the window. The lane has become a street and mounted another name, and if the abode of Catherine Perkins still has possession of the soil (which I question) it has no such aspect or such fragrant odours for its inmates, as made the errands so delicious to Miss Finch. She watched Catherine at her busy wheel, William stitching,pressing, pasting, sprinkling, gilding, and now and then lent him a helping hand or gave him a hint of which she said nothing at home ; and did it all with so much unaffected goodwill, that Mrs. Perkins, from regarding her at first with suspicion, began to take her into favour. Between his two trades William managed to keep himself and to increase his stock, but the living was very poor, and sales were not so frequent as he could wish. He had already turned his thoughts towards Southwell, and taking counsel with Catherine, bent his steps thither through the forest, with a parcel of the trash he called books, one Saturday about Michaelmas, and found a"], [166, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 154 pretty good sale for them among the market people. Before the day was over he had made the circuit of the little town, inspected the ancient ruins of the Archbishop's palace, taken a survey of the great church with its one cumbrous square tower and two angular spires, found a little empty shop near the Market Place, hired it for the year at the large rental of twenty shillings, and went back considerably elevated in his own im portance. About a hundred-weight of re-bound rubbish denominated books were sent by the carrier, along with tools and a few boards for shelves. He was his own carpenter and decorator, as well as his own salesman, and when he had ranged his stock ready for cus tomers, he looked around him with a feeling something akin to the discoverer of a new country. He was the first bookseller the town had known. He had brought literature within the reach of the natives of Southwell ! It was a sleepy, drowsy, half-dead place ; but loitering rustics who could tell the time of day, or prognosticate the weather from the aspect of the heavens above and the vegeta tion on the earth beneath, yet did not know a letter of the alphabet, loitered to watch him at his work, and lads with sun-bleached heads put them in at the door and grinned at the"], [167, "NEITHER SIGN NOR TOKEN. 155 strange sight, or contemplated glaring red and yellow unfolded frontispieces with open mouthed astonishment. In great cities persistent gazers attract passers-by to form a crowd, so the moneyless starers to whom books were sealed mysteries, drew thither others better informed and sup plied. At night he went back with six or seven shillings and an order for a couple of new school-books. The order came from a tall, thin, restless eyed man, who seemed to have shrunk within his clothes, in the long wear he had given them, and the heavier wear there had been on his body and mind. He said he was the schoolmaster, and gave his name as Field. Up to that moment busy William Hutton, preoccupied, had not given one thought to his old flame, Dolly. At once it leapt to his mind that she had married this schoolmaster's son. Without premeditation he was tempted to say, \" I believe your son married an old ac quaintance of mine. Miss Parker, a lacemaker. Are they doing well ? \" The old man's thin lips quivered, his long, lean fingers worked tremulously round the handle of his walking stick. \" Do not name them, sir !

She would never have suited me. A thriftless woman is a clog to an aspiring man. I do not envy Francis Field, whatever he may be. What a narrow escape I had! I may thank common sense and Mr. Webb for that.\" Neighbours, and that was all ! For a mere neighbour the subject kept pretty tolerable possession of his ruminations as he marched on under the cover of dusk, under the shining stars, under the brown and russet leaves of the sombre forest, little think ing how oft his good friend Mr. Webb had traversed the same wild road, or what that gentleman could have told of Francis Field."], [169, "NEITHER SIGN NOR TOKEN. 157 No, he was thinking more of his own wisdom in repulsing Miss Dolly, and wonder ing if he should ever come across her or her husband. It was ten o'clock when he reached home with the record of his day's doings, and he had been five hours on the road. He had started at five in the morning, and had not reached his shop until ten. He had banqueted on bread and cheese and a pint of ale (ale, mind you, not an adulterated subterfuge), and, as may be supposed, he was hungry enough to relish the bowl of milk porridge Catherine had read}T for him. His long and safe journey to London had given him courage to meet the dangers of the road, or rather to make light of them as non existent, but he changed his opinion before he was much older. He had taken his shop at Michaelmas, with the winter before him, and a wet winter it proved. Nevertheless, wet or fine, hail, rain, or snow, he tramped to Southwell and back every Saturday, sometimes bearing a heavy burden, sometimes with empty bag, but never with more than a few shillings in his pocket. More than once he passed suspicious looking characters in the forest at night, but they rather seemed to avoid than to molest him. It. however, caused him to lock up his"], [170, "158 IN HIS OWN BAND. silver knife in the old oak desk, that he might not be seen to use it in his shop, and so invite robbery on the road, as the Leicester landlady had suggested, The very next day, trim and speckless Lawyer Bulwell stood beside his counter with a parcel of penal statutes he required binding together. Will was regaling himself on inevitable cheese and bread, and laid it down together with a common clasp knife bought that morning from a Sheffield pedlar. Mr. Bulwell took it up to cut the string of his parcel. Had it been Mr. Webb's knife what revela tions might not have been made ! How much may hang upon the most trivial act of daily life. Trivial ? Is any act trivial? Can we calculate the consequences dependent on a word said or unsaid, nay, on a tone, the lifting of an eyelid ? Had the knife of his client lain there to be recognized, Mr. Bulwell would have pounced upon it, and cut the knot of a painful mystery in which great issues were involved. As it was, the man to whom \" Peter Webb's \" person and lineage were familiar, stood face to face with the younger man who had helped to carry the dead \" Peter Webb \" to his grave, and there was neither sign nor"], [171, "NEITHER SIGN NOR TOKEN. 159 token of mutual interest in his fortunes or his fate. Nay, Lawyer Bulwell became the purchaser of two odd volumes of the \" Universal Maga zine,\" newly bound and exposed for sale, and although Peter Webb's autograph was inscribed therein on a monthly part or so, no perception of original ownership was awakened. Weeks went on ; he had orders for binding which he executed at home, and for books to be obtained from larger traders in Nottingham, yet his profits were small, and but for the patrons who sought him out as the stocking knitting bookbinder, his perseverance and his cheerfulness would never have held out. Still he went and came bravely until his new courage received a shock one morning towards the end of November. It chanced to have been fine overnight with a touch of early frost about. The air was sharp and invigorating. The moon, now lost among clouds, now shining like an oval shield in a clear firmament shed a fitful light upon his path, as her slant rays were broken by the interlacing tracery of branching beech and elm and oak, bare and denuded as they were. The crisp brown leaves rustled under his feet, the odour of decaying vegetation greeted his nostrils, but he carried his light bag over his"], [172, "160 IX HIS OWX HAND. shoulder, and stepped out briskly, being lost in the composition of a humorous poem, his common antidote to loneliness and low spirits. So much was he absorbed that he neither heard the crackling of dry twigs, the crunch ing of old whins and dead leaves, nor the steps of men. Suddenly, where a blind path crossed the road as if a short cut from Best wood to Arnold, an abrupt gruff \" Hillo ! \" startled him to consciousness. He was confronted by four deer stealers, three men and a lad, whose wide-brimmed hats worn low on their brows kept their own faces in shadow. There could be no mistake, for slung between two, upon a long thick stick borne on the shoulders, hung a fine dead buck ; and the men carried guns. The meeting had been equalby unsought by all. There was no passing scot-free. His bag was plucked from him. A rough hand gripped him by the collar. A long hunting-knife glanced in the moonlight as if about to descend. William thought his last hour had come. \" Don't, don't ? \" he cried in alarm. \" My God ! Y'ou would not murder me ! I have done you no harm.\" \" Stay,\" interposed one of the other men, apparently younger and decidedly taller."], [173, "XIETHER SIGN NOR TOKEN. 161 \" No bloodshed ! He's harmless enough. The fellow hath not courage to stay the stick that beats him. Let the cur go.\" \" A cur con gie mouth. I'd as lieve be hanged fur a mon as a buck,\" growled the other, with the knife still close at William's breast. \" For God's sake, friends, be merciful. I'm but a poor hard-working man. I'd not betray you for the world.\" Whilst he thus implored in an agony of terror, his bag had been overhauled. There was a low laugh of scorn from the men bear ing the deer. The taller one, who had stopped the ruffian's hand now whispered in his ear, \" Curse you, let the chap go. He's almost dead with fright. He's only that soft bookselling fellow. Do you want to hang us all?\" Hope rose in William's breast at the alter cation, though he could not distinguish a word. \" If you only let me go, I'll give you my sacred promise not to betray you. I'll take a solemn oath to hold my tongue.\" \" Then see yow dun, or we' cut it from yowr throat one of these neets, and be d d to yow ! \" The man gave him a shake as he let him go.

He was allowed to gather up his bag and books, and with a blasphemous warn ing not to look back as he went, was hurried off' with a parting admonition not \" to blab.\" Look behind ? Not he ! Fast as his legs would carry him he ran, with many a stumble as he went, thankfulness for deliverance upper most in his mind, curiously blended with self content at his own prudence in leaving his silver knife safe in the custody of his desk. As the moon went down and darkness in creased so did his trepidation ; he was still in the dense woods, with the common danger of losing his path and becoming entangled among a labyrinth of tree trunks. But he feared the trees less than those they might harbour. The first glimpse of dawn shone in his face as he crossed the stepping-stones of the Dover Beck, and by the time he reached Oxton he was in a more composed state of mind. Good part of his way from the village lay over a common thickly sprinkled with dark groups of yews and scented junipers, but security came with daylight, and when he opened his little shop at ten o'clock he was himself again. In the course of the morning a lady and"], [175, "NEITHER SIGN XOR TOKEX. 163 gentleman, with a footman in livery behind them, stopped at his shop window and turned over his stock of pictorial books for children, selected one or two, asked for a child's horn book or battledore, were supplied with the latter, paid for the books, and were turning away when up came trim and dainty Mr. Bulwell. Off went the old gentleman's three-cornered hat to emphasize a deferential bow. \" Your servant, Madam West, vour servant Squire. Hope I see you well ? How thrives the son and heir ? \" \" Oh, hearty ! \" responded the gentleman. \" You must come over to the hall and see him.\" The lawyer again bowed.

I wish we had. I am placed in a situation of grave per plexity.\" \" And we also ! \" said the handsome and well-dressed squire, who seemed to be a few years older than his wife.

Looking at them as they stood there he was struck with the remarkable resemblance be tween the Squire and Madam, and long after they had gone their features haunted him, but only as something dimly remembered through a dream. It had been thawing all the day, towards evening rain set in, a perpetual soaking drizzle. He closed his shop earlier than usual, hoping to get through the forest whilst there was a chance of meeting country people returning from Nottingham market. But he had to plough his way through sodden leaves and slushy soil with the morning's encounter fresh in his mind ; and when he threw down his almost empty bag upon the window seat al, home his sister remarked, \" I think you will find the roads too heavy for you this winter.\" \" So do I,\" he said, but not a syllable of his meeting with the deer-stealers, though his tongue tingled to take his clever sister into his confidence.

He was ambitious and sought something more than a bare subsistence ; and he knewr that it must be sought elsewhere. Through his daughter old Mr. Finch learned that William's weekly tramp had grown wearying and distasteful, and at every pinch of snuff he rapped his box with his knuckles with an air of decided satisfaction, as if his own plans were ripening fast. Whether they were or were not there was a dormant feeling ripening in Susannah's breast, unsuspected by herself, calculated upon by her calculating father as the pivot on which his own project was to turn. He chuckled to himself as William laughed and chatted to the girl when business took him to the bookseller's shop, aud was extra gracious, but he never 'bated a penny from a bargain, and never said a word of his latent scheme ; though he took care to let the young man know how quick and clever a book stitcher Susannah was."], [178, "CHAPTER XII. THE HUT ON THE HEATH. William Hutton, ignorant of Mr. Finch's scheme, was turning over in his own mind the idea of quitting Southwell and Notting ham both, and starting life on a wider field. The adventure in the forest had shown that the danger of travelling early and late was a stern reality. He cared little for the discomforts of wind and wet, but a keen blade in the hands of a desperate ruffian was not to be thought of without a shudder by one who had felt its point at his breast. His project had no time to cool. Just three weeks later, as he took his usual way to Southwell, with about thirty pounds weight of books and paper in his bag, and neared the bye-way to Oxton, he was startled by the distant report of a gun, followed speedily by another and another, then a whistle and a loud halloo. He stood stock-still for a few moments, hesitating whether to proceed or to retreat. As he went on slowly and cautiously,"], [179, "THE HUT ON THE HEATH. 167 dreading another encounter with poachers, a tall, long-legged man rushed passed him at flying speed, and was lost in the gloom of the woods. \" What deed of darkness hath been done ? \" murmured William, as he again stood still. \" What horror or danger shall I encounter if I go on ? The sound came Mansfield way. Should I go seek it out, or send people from Oxton ? I have no weapons but my stick. I have Mr. Bulwell's books in my bag. I am not called upon to risk my life or his property by my own rashness. Prudence is a safer guide than valour.\" So thinking he turned into the Oxton bye way, which swept away from the Mansfield track with a north-easterly curve. It was about eight o'clock when he crossed Dover Beck, and ere he had gone many paces farther he saw before him in the grey twilight, about thirty yards ahead, a group of keepers with dogs and guns emerge from a blind path to the left, forcing before them a youth and a thick-set man bound together. The former had a red handkerchief tied round his thigh, and seemed to drag himself along with difficulty, venting curses on his captors and his own ill-luck at every step. They were followed by two more keepers, one of whom leaned on his comrade for support, and"], [180, "168 IN HIS OWN HAND. seemed in worse case than the poacher they had in charge. Two more fellows, apparently woodcutters by their gloves and billhooks, brought up the rear with a fallow deer between them. It was clear the men had been taken red-handed in the act. William was hurrying forward to satisfy his curiosity when he heard the wounded deer stealer, in a voice not to be forgotten, and with fearful imprecations, denounce vengeance on the head of \" that beggarly bookseller, whose blabbing tongue had brought them to that pass ; he'd better look out for his own throat if they had to swing.\" He stopped short. He had no desire to be recognized and confirm suspicion by his pre sence. Discretion overmastered curiosity. Thus though he caught the keeper's \" What bookseller ? \" he lost the disclaimer that the credit of the capture was due to any one or anything but the keeper's own sagacity and the flagrant bravado of the criminals. He knew they were hauling the poachers to the nearest Justice, and was half inclined to follow, but the stoppage would delay the opening of his shop, and he was already late. He must wait until he returned in the even ing to learn results. How does news travel in remote places ?"], [181, "THE HUT ON THE HEATH. 169 Before his shutters had been down ten minutes, a horseman in the yellow livery of the Wests rode up in hot haste to Lawyer Bulwell's, left some message at the door, then on to the schoolmaster's with some intelligence that caused the old man to stagger back with his hand to his brow and lean against the door-post for support. His first call had been at a doctor's, his last at the King's Arms ; but before doctor, lawyer, and servant rode off down the road to Oxton, and the long thin wiry limbs of Mr. Field were bearing him in the same direction, it was buzzed about the market, for transmis- sion to farms and villages afar, that four deer- stealers had been surprised in the forest by the keepers, that there had been a desperate struggle, one of the keepers was half-killed, and one of the poachers shot. This man, a notorious ruffian whose name was Harris, had been secured, along with his son. The other two men had escaped. One was conjectured to be a slippery old fellow named Tom Booth, a Nottingham whitesmith, who knew every nook of the forest, and had always contrived to elude the vigilance of the keepers, generally get- ting clear off with the game. And the keepers were ready to affirm that the fourth man was no other than Francis Field, the Southwell schoolmasters son; there was not light to see"], [182, "170 IN HIS OWN HAND. his face, but his height and his long legs were not to be mistaken. He had not been seen about the forest of late years, but his associa tions and his antecedents were pretty well known. These were substantially the facts, though rumour dressed them up with many variations. All morning William Hutton was in fear lest he should be called upon to say what he knew ofthe men, having heard himself referred to. Whilst the other two men were at large he preferred, for his own sake, to keep a still tongue in his head. As the day passed, and he heard that father and son had been sent to Nottingham prison to await the next gaol-delivery, he said to himself. \" Ah, the old ruffian knew he would tighten the cord round his neck if he set no better guard on his words. He found he had made a slip over ' the beggarly bookseller,' and has drawn in his horns.\" He closed his shop betimes, eager to be home again with his budget. As he crossed the common he met the old schoolmaster with his head bent low on his chest, walking along in a deep, sad reverie, and leaning heavily upon his stick. \" Good-night, sir,\" observed William in pass ing, but Mr. Field went on as if he neither saw nor heard."], [183, "THE HUT ON THE HEATH. 171 \"Poor old man,\" said William to himself, \" he seems two years older since ATesterday. Was that his son, I wonder ? He was like a long-legged giant flying past me. What a shock the suspicion must have been to a man so much respected. A bad son is indeed a grief to his father ! And his wife ? Poor Dolly, she deserved something better than a poacher, after all. I hope, for her sake, some mistake hath been made.\" He arrived home an hour earlier than ordi nary to find both Miss Finch and his Aunt Ann with Mrs. Perkins, all three talking over the capture of the notorious deer-stealers \u2014 who had been brought through the town to the old gaol on the mittimus of Justice West \u2014 and of the dangers he ran going through the lone some forest, when only thieves were about. He had not much belief in his Aunt Ann's new solicitude. He had more faith in the few words Susannah Finch greeted him with : \" I'm glad you're safe.\" His aunt had kept away from them so long as her money lasted. Now that she was not alwaj's sure of a meal, she came to recount her woes to Catherine, and share whatever she might have to set upon the board, though not always without ungracious comments on the humble fare. Weary though he was William was quite"], [184, "172 IN HIS OWN HAND. ready to take Miss Finch home ; his notions of gallantry being different from those of Thomas, who sat in the chimney-nook reading without a thought beyond it. Old Me. Finch blinked his eyes, rubbed his hands, tapped his snuff-box lid, took a pinch expressively, and handed the box to William. Matters were going on swimmingly, he thought. The conversation had been more of the risks William ran alike from the weather, dark roads, and bad characters than of love, unless the interest the girl evinced in his well being might lead to it. He had kept silent respecting his own en counter with the men in custody, but the general fears of others strengthened his own desire for a change, not such a one as was contemplated either by Mr. Finch or his more genuine daughter. After many debates whether William should bribe fortune in London or Birmingham, be tween Catherine and himself it was decided that the former place was too far removed from his kindred ; too far to remove his stock, and that there would be no room for a tyro who had not served a legal apprenticeship. The other was not only nearer, but it was a free town where a man might set up in any trade he liked, and push his way with the rest.

Moreover, he had means to pay for such accommodation as he sought, though it was certainly humble. He looked round with all his senses alert. Found three booksellers already established, but was again impressed with the size of the town, the throng in the streets, the spirit and activity of the people. \" I may make my way here before these great men see a beginner in so small a scale. If they do, I may excite a laugh, but not envy. An ant is not worth destroying.\" He looked in at the door of the Golden Stocking, on Francis Grace, there papering up a parcel of hose. \"Can I serve thee with anything? \" asked the Quaker, civilly. \" Nothing, sir.\" \"Then don't thee block up the doorwajr. It is unfair.\" William moved away with a smile, lie re called his very different expulsion from that doorway years before.

He had traversed the town, main streets and bye-ways, had made inquiries about rents, levies, and so forth, and left it the following day so well satisfied with the prospect before him that he determined to indulge himself in a little trip to his maiden aunt's at Swithland, and his uncle at Mountsorrel, little foreseeing the consequences to follow that unpremedi tated detour. The most direct route to Nottingham then lajr through Tamworth and Ashby-de-la- Zouch. But making inquiries at the former place (where he refreshed himself magnifi cently on the produce of a penny) he was instructed to follow a certain road as far as a place called Pipe Hall, on the border of Leicestershire, and then \" ask his way.\" Well he knew the road to Mountsorrel either from Derby or Nottingham, but, alas ! for his confidence in the direction of casual wayfarers. He soon discovered that he had plunged into a labyrinth of zigzag lanes and pack-horse tracks crossing and intersecting so deviously as nearly to double the actual"], [187, "THE HUT ON THE HEATH. 175 distance, there being in fact not even the pretence of a direct road half a century later. From one village he was passed on to another by rustics who hardly knew the world five miles from their own doors, and though some of these could tell him he would have Cham wood Forest to cross, not even the last cottager he asked had the sense to suggest how closely he was upon it, though the evening was growing dusk, and rain had begun to fall. Through the straggling village he went on \u25a0o Co o O the look-out for a wayside public-house where he might rest for the night. He had left the last cottage behind, but no light streaming from door or window indi cated the hospitality which is open to all who can pay. The dusk had deepened almost to dark, when it suddenly occurred to him that the shadowy hedges had fallen away, and the ground was exceptionally rough and uneven. Then he stumbled over a bush of gorse or butcher's broom, and scratched his hands in an effort to save himself. He was already in the forest, on a treeless, trackless waste, in the pitiless rain, without a star or a light to guide him through the darkness. To return was as hopeless as to go on."], [188, "176 IN HIS OWN HAND. Sherwood was densely planted with trees, and there was man}' a hollow trunk to shelter a benighted traveller who was not inclined to mistake an owl for a bogey. But Charnwood was for miles an almost treeless waste, beset with huge rocks, here and there falling away in sudden precipices, and inlaid with pits and quagmires equally to be dreaded in the dark. William's ready stick as he felt his way, hoping against hope to find a shelter, told him thus much, and silled the night with terrors worse than rain, fatigue, or hunger, and they were not comfortable companions. He shouted aloud for help \u2014 only his own voice was heard. Once or twice he set his back against a mass of rock, and as he rested tried to calcu late the miles he had travelled that day, and the chances whether he should perish of wet, and cold and hunger, as many a forlorn traveller had done. There was no estimating distance save by weariness, and the stiffness of his limbs. \" This will not do ! \" he cried, rousing him self with an effort. \"To drowse here is death. I must keep in motion until daylight, whatever comes of it.\" And putting his hands to his mouth he gave a loud halloo. Again he was on his feet, feeling his way"], [189, "THE HUT ON THE HEATH. 177 at every step, soaked through with the pelt ing rain, which mocked his misery. Again and again he shouted, there was no reply. Suddenly a dark shadow which he had taken for another rock resolved itself into a hut. \" Thank God ! \" said he. \" However rude, there must be a refuge here.\" As he approached he dimly discerned what seemed the gigantic figure of a man faintly outlined in the lesser gloom of the open doorway. His steps were arrested by the sharp demand in the harshest of tones, \" What do you want here ? Who are you?\" William answered the latter question first. \" A forlorn and benighted traveller. I seek a shelter for the night.\" \" Then seek it elsewhere. There's no shelter for you here,\" was the repelling answer. William had drawn a step or two nearer. \" Surely you have not the heart to deny me a cover from the inclemency of the storm ? \" \" Keep back, I say. The storm is not more inclement than the pitiless wrath of man ! \" William moved, but not backward. \" If you shut me out on this desolate heath you will have my death to answer for.\" vol. 1. 12"], [190, "178 IN HIS OWN HAND.

Unless you let me in I shall drop where I stand. You will find a corpse on your threshold when you rise in the morning.\" William thought he heard a woman's voice within. The man answered never a word. But the suppliant half fancied there was a movement of the giant's limbs and shoulders nearer to the door-post. At all events there seemed to be a gap. He was inclined to take silence for consent. \" Ah, master, I thought you would not let a fellow-creature perish close to your home. Thank you for making way,\" William said, as he edged himself into the hut. As he passed he thought he heard the man mutter between his teeth, as if in stifled despair, \" Home ! My God ! Home ! \" The darkness within was scarcely less than the darkness without, though there was a low fire smouldering on the flat stone which served for a hearth, just a peat or two with a glow at the heart. It served, however, to give him an idea that he was in a room not more than ten feet square, and that there [was apparently such another room beyond."], [191, "THE HUT ON THE HEATH. 179 On a rude bench huddled two women, close to this apology for a fire, not sufficient indeed to reveal their faces. There were a couple of three-legged stools on the opposite side, and William, unassisted, possessed himself of the one nearest the fire. The man still propped up the door-post, regardless of the rain. As the cold rough blast came tearing over the waste and threatened to unroof the hut, William felt that a closed door would have been more comfortable for those within, but the man seemed as insensible to the wind as to the common rights of others. Very little was said. William was the chief talker. He told how far he had journeyed that day, how he had been misdirected, whither he was bound, how slight had been his noonday repast, and wound up by saying, \" I should be very thankful for anything in the way of food. I am almost famishing.\" \" So are we,\" said the younger woman bit terly. \" We han' nothing but a little pease porridge, an' that is too thin to offer yow.\" Her tone was subdued as if modulated not to reach the man in the doorway, but there were notes in it which struck upon William's ear with a faint familiar ring. \" Hunger is not dainty,\" he replied. \" Any- 12 2"], [192, "180 7Y 777S OWN HAND. thing would be more acceptable than starva tion.\" \" Aye,\" she muttered in a still lower tone as she rose from her chair to put a pipkin on the fire, \" even honest work.\" With her ragged petticoat she fanned the peat to a glow. As she did so the man closed the door, and took the seat she had quitted, offering a rough apology to William, and pleading poverty as an excuse for his inci vility. \" I have had all my garden and outbuild ings wrecked by rioters,\" he said. \" I did not know but you were one of their spies, and that, perhaps, you might bring them down on, us again to-morrow to deprive my wife and children of the only shelter we have. To say nothing of our cousin here who has lost father and brother both, and has no friends but us.\" As William expressed his sympathy, the wife, moving about in the dark, brought some bowls and laid them out on the hearth, where they were only dimly visible. \" Here,\" said the man, \" you need a light to pour it out by.

He had barely tasted the lukewarm pease porridge, when by its light he caught a glimpse of the woman opposite, or all that her slouch hat did not hide. That transient glance destroyed his appetite. She had a hare-lip (a common deformity then), and its effect in eating was hideous and repulsive. Had not the flame died down instantane ously, and left all faces in deep shadow, not even his hunger would have enabled him to swallow another mouthful. The bowls emptied, the man became con versable, and after a while there was a move to the room beyond. By the light of another flaming leaf, William could dimly discern the shape of two bedsteads, the head of one serv ing as a screen from the other, whence came the low regular breathing of chddhood. \" That is the best couch we have to offer you,\" said the man, \" and we are not rich in bed furniture.\" \"Ah,\" cried William, \"the dry sacking is preferable to the wet heath on a night like this. I must have perished but for your humanity.

A garment of some sort was pitched over the bed-head to him. \" Cover yowrsen with that,\" he was told, and he obeyed. Fatigued as he was he could not at once fall asleep. All around him was strange and mysterious. He did not fear robbery, he had so little to lose. What he had seen betokened the direst poverty, but he took it for the out come of indolence not of dishonesty. The man's language was not that of a labouring rustic. A scrap of the lighted paper had fallen on his knee. Removing it, he saw by its own flame that it was torn from a Latin dictionary. What should bring a Latin dic tionary there? And what was there in the younger woman's voice that struck a chord of memory ? He wished he had seen her face. And between his cogitations, and the beating rain, and his thankfulness for shelter, he was kept awake. What face was that the morning light revealed to him ?"], [195, "CHAPTER XIII. \"TN POVERTY, HUNGER, AND DIRT.\" William awoke the next morning with a chilly impression that the cloak or petticoat flung to him over-night as a coverlet had been suddenly withdrawn, and that some one had whispered close to his ear, \" Be cautious ! Take no notice ! \" Had he been awake, or dreaming ? No one was there, but the words were clear and dis tinct as the tone of a bell. At all events they put him on his guard. All the others were up. Where they had slept he could only conjecture. In the faint morning light he could not descry a sign of a third bedstead. There was an old box, and a broken hand-basin upon it, but neither chair nor table ; the squalor was appalling. There was a noise of children quarrelling in the next room. As he entered, the elder, a black-haired lad, already breeched, though not more than six years old, struck the younger and slighter-built child who seemed"], [196, "184 IX HIS OWX HAXD rather enveloped than dressed in the cast-ost petticoats of his brother. The blow provoked a cry. The cousin, cowering over a fireless hearth, and still concealed by her slouch hat, swore at the child. \"Hang yow, hold yor bellow ing, or I'll gie yow summat to cry fur.\" \" Nay, mistress,\" William could not help saying, as he beheld the little one shrink away timidly, and with an effort to choke the cry to a sob, \" the little lad's not to blame. You would cry out if some one struck you.\" The woman made him no answer, but a slight upward jerk of her head gave him a momentary glimpse of a vicious set of the teeth laid bare by the hare-lip, and a pair of greenish cross-eyes fixed on him savagely, whilst the brown hands laid loosely on her knees were fiercely gripped. He shivered, said he \"must have caught cold,\" and looked at the dead embers on the hearth. But the aspect of the woman alone caused the involuntary shudder, as he thought, \" You've a temper, mistress, as ugly as your face. Keep your hat well down. Hide ousness is best covered !

I hope she won't come back with empty hands. That way to the spring.\" Will was going as directed, wondering if names were as scarce as food, and presuming that she meant the wife, when the youngest little lad, who had his right hand bound up in a dirty rag, ran towards him crying out, \" Me go too, me be washed.\" \" Go back, you young imp !\" the man cried with threatening voice and gesture, adding in a different tone as he caught William's look"], [198, "186 7Y 77/5 OWN HAND. of surprise : \" You must wait till mother comes to wash you and your brother both.\" The child slunk back, cowed. The man led the way to the spring, making a sort of apology for his short temper, and as Will bared his throat and laved his hands and face in the clear cold water, which came gushing up from among a group of stones, and had worn a channel for itself, remarked, \" You see, sir, I've not been myself since the rioters made havoc of the home I had planted here.\" \" What rioters ? \" \" The freeholders of Charnwood ! It seems they claim certain rights and privileges in the forest, and have banded together to wreck and destroy every house and hut built on the waste and common land without their sanc tion.

They had the right of the strong hand. But, by Heaven! I'll be even with some of them yet. Let any man beware who does me a wrong,\" and he raised his clenched hand threateningly. William looked from the ruined outhouses up at the grimy face before him, noting how the black brows met and loured over eyes like fiery coals, and wondered if the man had any right to self-appropriate the land, and how he should feel if rioters wrecked a house of his. Strange was the conversation, stranger was the juxtaposition of those two men if either had but known it. Where had William seen a face resembling the one before him, and similarly distorted with passion? As he looked out across the sloppy waste where the recent rain now lay in little pools and spangled the herbage, pondering the query he had put to his memory, he observed a female figure rise as it were out of the"], [200, "188 IN HIS OWN HAND. rolling mist that veiled the distant landscape, becoming more and more distinct as she drew nearer. The owner of the hut must also have seen her, for he made a move to go back for breakfast. In her hands she bore a red earthen pitcher and a portion of a loaf. As he watched her approach something familiar in her gait and bearing claimed recognition, the very set of the gipsy hat upon her head, torn and faded though it was. And the face ! How his heart sank. Could that thin, care-worn, lined, and dirty face ever have been pretty Dolly Parker's ? He knew whom the long-legged, angry, close-browed man resembled now \u2014 it was schoolmaster Field ! They met almost at the door of the cot. The husband bent his tall head and led the way in. A glance of sad recognition passed between Dolly Field and William. He would have spoken, but a significant shake of the head, and a prohibitory frown at the broad shouldered form in advance checked the words on his lips. The warning he had heard in waking flashed across his mind. It was no dream. He was so stunned with the discovery he could scarcely preserve an indifferent coun tenance."], [201, "\" IN POVERTY, HUNGER, AND DIRT\" 189 The children had again been quarrelling, this time for the possession of a ball. It was dirty enough then, but it had been bright scarlet leather, gaily worked over with coloured silks. It was an expensive article, singularly out of keeping with its surroundings. William pitied the little fellow who seemed to have so rough and ill-natured a brother, and somehow he saw a contrast between the boys which suggested in the black ej^es and brows of the elder a cause for favouritism ; and in the more delicate frame and outline of the younger one a leaning towards the mother's side, which, perhaps, might tell against the child. The boy, as if recognizing a friend, sidled up to him. He took him between his knees, stroked the tangled light brown hair, and asked him what he had cried for. \" Fank hurted my bad hand,\" and he held out the one in the wraps. \" Frank will be more careful another time. But what made it bad? Did you burn yourself? \" \" No, door hurted it. Oh, so much.\" Talking to the boy, William did not notice the scowling face of the silent woman in the corner. \" And what's your name, little one ? \" pursued William, caressingly."], [202, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 190 \"Vill!\" \" Will ! Why that's my name.\" \" Not Will\u2014 Vill,\" explained the child. \"We call him Bill,\" cried Field gruffly. \" Here, Peg, take the lad to your side. He's troublesome.\" William would have protested against the change ; but he caught another warning glance from Dolly Field as she cut the bread into thick slices ; and, indeed, Peg's long brown arm had already stretched across the hearth and dragged the shrinking little one away, whilst Frank clapped his dirty hands and set up a laugh. \" A rare way to train up children,\" thought William. \" I pity poor little Bill.\" But he was glad to wash away the thought with the same draught of cold milk that washed down the slice of bread held out to him . After gratefully participating in the scant breakfast, which he had every reason to sup pose was begged, not bought, William had no excuse for remaining. He would gladly have exchanged a few words with Dolly, but her husband still hung about, and the silent woman in the corner might be watching like a cat, for all her cross eyes revealed. He rose and took his stick in hand. \" I am"], [203, "\"7,V POVERTY, HUNGER, AND DIRT.\" 191 very grateful and thankful,\" said he. \" But for the shelter and food you have supplied I must have perished. I am too poor to make proper return. Should it ever be in my power, I shall not forget your kindness. Per haps,\" turning to the great hulking fellow staring at the cold hearth, \" you would not object to set me on the right road to Swith land.\" \" No,\" said Field. \" As well out as in. There's naught to be done.\" \" Naught to be done,\" thought William, \" with your place in ruins, and your children starving! I should find plenty to do.\" But he only bade them all \" farewell,\" and stepped out. As he reached the door little Bill came after him at a run. \" Me do with oo ! Me do with oo ! \" cried he eagerly, and caught at William's hand. Francis Field clutched the boy by the shoulder and gave it a rough shake, and thrust him back. \" Go back, go back I say ; who wants a squalling brat. Here, Peg, take him in.\" The child, who clung to William, was dragged away whimpering, with a look of appeal in his eyes that haunted Will all the day. He thought he heard a blow, he knew he heard a child scream before they were five yards from the"], [204, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 192 door, and would fain have turned again to protest against ill-usage, but he remembered his own childhood and Samuel's, and feared interference might do more harm than good. Field stalked along moodily, his hands thrust into the deep pockets of his flap waistcoat. It had been a bright yellow once upon a time. To break the silence, Will began, \" Do you not intend to cultivate your ground again, and repair the damage done by the rioters ? \" \" To what end ? \" answered the man fiercely. \" To have them wrecked again ? No ! Let them work that work prospers with. It hath brought no luck to me.\" \" Ah, my friend, much depends on the worker. I've not had much of what you call ' luck,' but I mean to persevere. ' No gains without pains,' says poor Richard, ' then help hands, for I've no lands.' I'm poor now, but whatever be my luck, it shall not be the luck of laziness \u2014 that's sure to be ill-luck.\" Field eyed him askance. \" Then you do not believe in luck ? \" \" I don't. I believe in honest hard work, that God may bless. If work does no more for a man, it keeps his joints supple, his hands from mischief, his sleep sound. Industry and thrift are sure friends. But let a man coin the sweat of his brow into guineas, if all he"], [205, "\" IN POVERTY, HUNGER, AND DIRT.\" 193 earns goes down his throat or on his back, he labours to small profit.\" \" Humph ! \" sneered Field, who did not seem to relish his companion's preaching. \" What have industry or thrift done for you ? lrou seem poor enough.\" \" Aye, I'm no stranger to belly-ache or pocket-ache either. But I've health, energy, hope, and self-respect. All steps in fortune's ladder,\" responded William proudly ; \" and if I don't mount it before I die, it shall not be my fault.\" \"Self-respect? Oh, oh!\" chuckled the other, to whom the early episode of the stolen two shillings had filtered through Roper and Dolly, and whose memory retained what William had overlooked \u2014 but believing him self unknown, he made no allusion to provoke personal and inconvenient recognition. Then with a quick and gruff transition, he added, \" Then mount your ladder and be d d to you. If you were burdened with a wife and children you'd be none so nimble. You'd look out like me for a stroke of luck to land you atop without climbing.\" William looked serious. Shaking his head, he said slowly and deliberately, \" No, I may be older than you, but I've not been able to afford the luxury of a wife. I must have a home and a few spare guineas before that vol. i. 13"], [206, "7Y HIS OWN HAND. 194 comes to pass. I could bear poverty and hunger myself, but not the extra pinch they would give through wife or child.\" He was thinking of Dolly and her children, and what might have been had he yielded to temptation. Field ground his teeth. Large, firm, white, cruel teeth they were. \" Aye,\" he said hotly, half between them, \" it was an ill-fated day when I tied myself to a wife. Yet she had a pretty face and that in her fingers which might have kept us all when tiouble came had she been so minded. You say true ; a wife's a burden to a man of spirit.\" William wondered wherein lay the spirit of the man who had plainly expected his wife to keep him. He took him up quickly. \"Nay, I did not say that. A wife must be a comfort to a man of sense. He will choose his wife for her worth, and wait till it is prudent to wed.\" \" All men have not your prudence or dis cernment,\" sneered Field, relapsing into his vicious mood; \"and some are born to ill-luck. The devil seems to cast his club over them in the cradle.\" \" I tell you I don't believe in ill-luck. Hercules, in his cradle, strangled the snakes sent to destroy him. If ever the devil cast a club over a cradle it was mine. Strong will breaks the devil's club, my friend. If not broken early it may break you.\""], [207, "\" IN POVERTY, HUNGER, AND DIRT\" 195 \" Aye,\" assented the other, gloomily, \" there you are right. Maybe you have faith in fore casts, if you have none in luck. An old fellow I met one day, when I was but a lad a little over eighteen, forecast fate for me with a vengeance. A chance blow with my stick ripped a bird's nest from a bush, and it served him for a text to predict all manner of evil, with the gallows to end all. One half of his prophecy came true when I stood beside a desolated home, and if I only had the old fellow here now I'd throttle him if I brought the other half to pass straightway. Ill-luck has seemed to track me ever since. But other hearths may be desolate too. I've struck an even balance.\" William was getting heartily afraid of his guide. He clutched at the empty air as if it were a human throat, and such a demoniac light seemed to flash in his eyes, as made the peaceful traveller's flesh creep, and brought back the sensation of the deer-stealer's hand on his own throat as he had felt it in Sherwood. With that came the remembrance of the man's voice who had interposed to prevent bloodshed, but gratitude for a past benefit did not prevent uneasiness. The morning was fine after the rain, though the sky was a dull grey. They had been traversing a region without a track, where 13\u20142"], [208, "196 IN HIS OWN HAND. stones were more plentiful than trees, where the few oaks were hollow and stunted, and little besides the alder and the holly kept possession of the soil, where a century before the foliage had been so dense in summer-time as to keep out the intrusive sun. Great jagged rocks cropped up here and there, and when the mist cleared away, there were wooded parks visible in the distance. Farther still away in the north and west, the swelling outline of high hills broke the line of the horizon, dim and mistj^, like clouds saluting clouds. Near at hand all was waste where even the few scurrying rabbits seemed companionless. William remarked it, to turn the unpleasant conversation, but it only served Francis Field for another outburst. \" Aye, curse the rioters, this half the forest was alive with conies, till the brutes of colliers they got to helpj them tore up the warrens and killed them all. There's naught left for a man to live on now ; and we're not to call it ill luck.\" His lips curled with intense scorn, and he ground his teeth after the bitter words. \" My friend,\" said uncomfortable William, in a conciliatory tone, though not unmarked by apprehension, \" are you certain of your road ? \" He had observed that certain landmarks"], [209, "\" IN POVERTY, HUNGER, AND DIRT.\" 197 shifted their position strangely, and his doubts of his guide suggested that he was for some sinister purpose being led astray. The man had no mind that William Hutton should have a clue to the whereabouts of his own rude dwelling, but he did not say so. \" Know the road ? Aye, blindfold. You may thank your lucky stars you had me to guide you. Look ahead. Yon's Swithland Wood. Make for it, straight as you can. You will come across a beaten path half-a mile or so away. That's your road. And this is mine.\" He was turning away. \" Stay,\" cried William, \" you gave me the shelter of a roof and food to stay my hunger, and have set me on my road. Here's sixpence for you. I am too poor to offer more or you should have it.\" \" Sixpences have been scarce with one of late, master, or I'd have scorned to take it,\" was Field's reply as his fingers closed upon the coin, and they went their several ways ; each thinking his individuality unknown to the other, neither desiring ever to meet again. The one who had urgent reasons for con cealment, hugged himself in the belief that the change wrought in his once pretty wife by years, distress, and dirt had been so effectual as to blind the eyes even of an old admirer. \" Ugh ! \" grunted he, \" the self-conceited ape"], [210, "198 IN HIS OWN HAND. could see nothing but himself and the fortune he is going to make with honest hard work! Oh, ho ! How I could have laughed at his preaching ! A pitiful drudge ! It was lucky for him he was blind, or he might have found his fortune at the bottom of some pool. Dirt and rags are rare disguises. Dolly unrecog nized and me unknown ; we're safe from him at least. That bleating little imp with his ' hurted hand ' and his ' Vill,' had nearly spoiled all. But Bill Hutton suspects naught, and we're safe as a fox in his hole \" Very different were the cogitations of William as he rapidly increased the distance between them. \" Thank God, I'm quit of him. Better see his back than his face. Poor Doll}' ! Poor lass! She made a sad bargain with her pretty face. Does the lazy, lounging brute ill-use her ? That warning whisper meant something. Was her fear for herself, or me, or him ? What a nightmare that hideous Peg must be to her, and little Bill. Poor chap, he must come off badly amongst them, if his mother has not strength or spirit to protect him. Frank's the father's own son clearly, strong and masterful. Poor schoolmaster Field !

He would never betray his own blood to the hangman. There are worse crimes than deer-stealing. Even Shakespeare called it sport in his wild young days. It all comes of hot blood and idleness. If I tell the schoolmaster the misery I have witnessed, he will surely forgive his son and help them all.\" Blind William Hutton !"], [212, "CHAPTER XIV. ONE TAKEN, THE OTHER LEFT. If William Hutton had anticipated any assist ance in his projected undertaking from his well-to-do spinster aunts at Swithland, or his bachelor uncle at Mountsorrel, he would have carried disappointment home with him, and lost more than his way or his time when he made his impulsive detour from Tamworth to visit them. Fortunately for his hungry body, the drapery and grocery shop with double-bay windows was already opened for the day. Miss Ward and 'her sister Mary had not arisen from their comfortable breakfast-table, or he might not have fared as he did after his early morning walk. The preparation of an impromptu meal would have disordered the whole mechanism of the household. As it was, he came from the outer world, was sure to have a budget of news to unfold, news so precious in an out-of-the-way spot that, in spite of the inauspicious salutation, \"What ill-wind brought thee hither?\" the"], [213, "ONE TAKEN, THE OTHER LEFT. 201 prompt and business-like women from whose side of the family he and Catherine derived aught of energy they might possess, were willing to prolong their morning meal and admit him to a share whilst he unfolded his plans and let them know he was about to \" keep a shop in Birmingham.\" \" Prithee take heed thy shop keeps thee,\" put in Miss Ward with grim severity. \" Thou'lt be the first of the Huttons worth a groat if it doth more.\" \" Catherine's a Hutton ! \" he retorted sharply, feeling his sister's aptitude and energy equally impugned with his own. \" Aye, but she takes after her mother. She is more than half a Ward. And did not we rear and train her from her babyhood? Thou may thank us thy sister is what she is. Aye, and thou may thank thy Aunt Betsy, dead and gone though she be, for first putting the horn-book into thy hands, if books are finding thee a living.\" William sighed. He had a reminiscence of his four-year-old self seated on a bench with his feet dangling in the air, afraid to stir lest he should fall, and feeling on his drowsy head the horn-book that had fallen from his sleepy fingers. Alpha-beta had not come to him kindly through his schoolmistress aunt. The very servant, gaunt and grim, whose"], [214, "202 IN HIS OWN HAND. hair had grizzled, and sprouted on her chin since he knew her first, brought in along with the coffee-cup, saucer and broiled collop of hung beef, a still less agreeable reminder of the night when she hauled him out of bed, half-asleep, and dangling him by one arm, night-shir ted as he was, bumped her bony knee into his back at every step down-stairs, as she carried him to the poor mother waiting to bear him home. He had few pleasant memories of the old red granite house where so many of his infantile months had been spent with his austere aunts. His father had then failed in business, their sister's marriage with an un fortunate trader was a crime, and his little self an encumbrance. Remembering all this why had he gone thither? Th\u00b0re must have been some childish asso ciations with the spot not wholly discordant, something apart from ties of kinship so repel ling, if he could not give them shape or form. He left Miss Ward and her sister in their twofold shop where the overflowing stock bulged from shelves, dangled from the ceiling, silled canisters and drawers, and opening the black half-door went down the well-worn step into the street, bearing with him messages for"], [215, "ONE TAKEN, THE OTHER LEFT. 203 Catherine and their own bachelor brother two miles away at Mountsorrel, but nothing more, unless advice and admonition were to count as valuable gifts. He would scarcely have climbed the rocky street to his uncle Ward's but for the message he had undertaken to deliver There were the same vaticinations of failure consequent on the sluggishness of the Hutton tempera ment, the same benevolent outpouring of advice, but not so much as a glass of small beer was offered to the nephew who had come so far out of his way to see his kin. Perhaps they suspected him of ulterior motives. If so they were wrong. He had but obeyed a sudden impulse when he turned aside at Tamworth, the consequences of which were not for him to foresee. But something of his relatives' suspicions must have been apparent, for no sooner had he turned his back on the craggy hill and red granite houses of Mountsorrel than the idea seemed to strike him. \" Surely they did not fancy I went to seek help from them! Them? As soon ask the stones underfoot. I knew better. They did not help their own sister in her extremity, or show kindness to the little lad thrown on their compassion.

It lit up fitfully the smiling river Soar, the long range of red hills, and a dusky mist which, when the swelling buds ripened to bursting, would be green copse or woodland vocal with the songs of spring. For a moment he stopped to think how lovely and picturesque was the well-known scene, and how vividly the patches of fresh green grass contrasted with the dark red rock around, and he carried the imprint away for memory to dwell upon in after-time. It was but a moment he paused for senti ment. He kept on his way northward, newly braced for the seventeen miles before him with his determination to show his cross-grained aunts that there was some mettle in one of the Buttons wherever it came from."], [217, "ONE TAKEN, THE OTHER LEFT. 205 So it may be he had not lost his time after all. Nor had he been so self-absorbed as to for get Dolly and her surroundings at Charnwood. Recalling his own infant troubles brought little \" Vill \" palpably before him, and he could not rid himself of the image conjured up. The contrast of the two boys ; the shrinking fear of the one, his haste to escape from his home even with a stranger. He found himself pity ing the child more than he pitied the woman. \" She brought disaster on herself,\" he argued, \" the child is an irresponsible victim. And how unlike his brother. Who is he like? Not his beetle-browed father, not his flaxen haired mother ; the one has a nose like a hatchet, the other a saucy turn-up bewitching to unwary young simpletons. Ah ! Dolly, you gave me a taste of your tongue in time, or you might have driven me to distraction as you drove Joseph Roper.

Or was it the resemblance of helpless age to helpless childhood? Most probable.\""], [218, "206 IX HIS OWN HAND. Then thought went off at a tangent to his own affairs, or was diverted by objects passed on the way, but still, through all, Mr. Webb's eyes looked out of a child-face, and \"I'll do vith oo ! \" rang in his ears. Rain was falling when he approached Not tingham between four and five in the after noon, rain that must have been of long continuance, for the twenty arches of the Trent Bridge spanned a flood that blotted out the flowery meadows and kept the bargemen busily anxious for the security of their several crafts moored alongside wharves, loading or \u00a3***\u25a0 , o unloading cargoes of coal, crockery, iron, timber, leather and other merchandise ; the chief carrying of the country being along the watery highway wheresoever was a navigable river. The great canal mania had not yet set in. The long narrow bridge was crowded. William, apprehensive of some disaster arising from the flood, accosted a packman resting against the parapet. \" It be 'sizes, mon ! \" He had his answer. It was the Spring Assize. Judge and his attendant javelin men were entering the town to awe the multitude, and be met with due ceremonial by the sheriff and his posse. The rabble-rout had grown and gathered as they came."], [219, "ONE TAKEN, THE OTHER LEFT. 207 The man volunteered an opinion. \" Theren be summat moore te gawp et afore another week, if them deer-stealers getten theere due.\" Was it a coincidence or some association in his own mind that suggested to William OO the peculiar slouched hat of the woman Peg, in the crowd before him, and made him look for the tall head and shoulders of Francis Field ? Objects were but indistinctly seen through the falling rain, the woman kept her head well down, and had she not turned round savagely to glare at some one who jostled her William would have been doubtful. Once seen, her face was not to be forgotten. What brought her there ? How had she overtaken him ? \" You must have nimble feet and known a shorter cut through Charnwood than I found, sweet Mistress Peg, to get here first, though I did go round about to see folk who cared naught to see me,\" he said to himself. But even as he spoke Peg elbowed her way forward and was lost. Catherine's wheel was going at double quick speed. She had expected him home the night before, and her anxiety expended itself in more vigorous turning of the wheel, more rapid twirling of the thread on the"], [220, "208 IN HIS OWN HAND. spindle. She kept her fears and her conjec tures to herself, and stolid Thomas, who took the world easily, never knew she was either anxious or uneasy. Her \" Thank God you are here safe ! What detained you ? \" was not much to say, but William kissed her with a consciousness one true heart was there to welcome him home. And such a home, so bright, so fresh ! He involuntarily stooped to unbuckle his muddy shoes on the rush door-mat in homage to its cleanliness ; and hesitated to seat himself on the polished settle in his soaking garments. \" I thought you would be wet. Here are dry clothes. Put them on in the workshop, whilst I get you a warm meal.\" Another instance of her sisterly care, another contrast to cross Aunt Ann. A greater contrast all to the poverty-stricken home of slatternly Dolly Field. When Susannah Finch lifted the latch an hour later to ascertain if the traveller had returned, she found him seated cosily by the fire full of his adventures (told with prudent reservations), but, although he made room for her beside him on the settle, he was also full of the risks a man encountered in a hasty plunge into matrimony. A conclusion, as she thought, precipitately drawn from a single night among poor strangers on a wild waste,"], [221, "ONE TAKEN, THE OTHER LEFT. 209 whose ruin was the work of others. Dolly's name had not passed his lips. Susannah had come, muffled in her hood and on pattened feet, to assure herself of his safety. Her heart had fluttered with joy at the sound of his voice, the touch of his hand. She went home dejected. She was allowed to go home alone. William made a very ungallant speech when she had gone. \" If Susannah Finch wants a sweetheart she should stay at home and keep her father's shop clean and tidy, and not waste her time coming here. Gadding girls don't make good wives.\" \" Don't be conceited. Susannah comes to see me, I am teaching her to spin. Men want more from wives than they themselves have to render. There are worse girls than Susannah.\" And Catherine Perkins set her face sternly as she spoke, sending her wheel round with a sudden jerk that snapped her thread. The assizes were on, and William had a secret desire to know7 the fate of the deer stealers, but he was not given to waste time lounging among gossips at street corners ; he had need to work early and late to make up for time spent in travelling, and he had a mortal dread of being seen near the court by either of the men at large. He had no desire vol. 1. 1-J"], [222, "IN HIS OWX HAND. 210 either to tighten the noose round the neck of old Harris, nor to put his own life into jeopardy as a suspected informer. He had still an inclination to lift the hus band of Dolly out of the slough of poverty if it could be done by a reconciliation with Field's father. Determined to use his best endeavours to effect this, he took his way through the damp and dusky forest on the Saturday, intending not only to give notice to his landlord, but to keep a sharp look-out for the schoolmaster during the day. He might have worn out his eyes with looking. Schoolmaster Field had been buried the day before. Killed, it was said, by the suspicion of his son's share in the murderous outrage on a keeper who was doing his duty. It was the climax to a series of wild misdeeds and had broken the upright old man's heart. He had lived alone ; a solitary man with no companions but his books; no attendant but a woman for an hour or two each day. His school was broken up for ever. His house was shut up with all it contained. There was no will. Speculation wondered if Francis Field would dare come forward to claim his father's few possessions.

I might give her a hint.\" He came across \" Peg \" sooner than ex pected ; and she had the hint from other tongue than his. The misfortunes of others are seldom over powering where self is not affected. He had done a fair day's trade, given his notice to quit, and had almost forgotten the Fields in his long tramp homewards, when, on the con fines of the forest, his attention was attracted to three stationary horn lanterns and several moving figures, some with spades, others fix ing a gaunt black post with a significant arm outstretched. 14\u20142"], [224, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 212 He shuddered, and stood for a moment aghast. Little need to remind him that they stood on the brow of Gallows Hill, or the purpose of that hideous frame. He could hear the men coarsely laughing and jesting over their work.

Refinement of feeling or of speech was con fined to the cultivated or Christian few.

It was therefore with a curious mingling of"], [225, "ONE TAKEN, IHE OTHER LEFT. 213 sensations, in which pity for the felon who had held a knife at his own breast could not truthfully be said to have paramount sway, that he felt in his pocket for two or three pence to satisfy the unexpected call, when out of the darkness sprang a woman in an old grey cloak and common slouch hat to pour out the vials of her wrath and indignation in language little more choice than that of the hangman's crew. \" A show, ye brutes, yo wouldn hang up the mothers that bore ye as a show, if ye couldu get a guinea fur th' job!

The road safer ? \" she set up a discordant laugh. \" The very blades of grass will rise up to revenge the deed yow do in the name of the law, yow skulking, bloodthirsty villains,\" she cried with wild gesticulations and an admixture of oaths not to be re peated The light of the lanterns had fallen on her face, and caused William to shrink into the shadows as he caught sight of a hare-lip and greenish-grey cross-eyes now full of baleful sire. \" It's that d d vixen Peg Harris,\" one of the fellows had said to his mates when"], [226, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 214 she burst upon them. \" Shu's been rampa ging round th' gaol like a mad woman since shu heard that her father was to swing and that hopeful brother of hers be transported.\" \" I say, Mistress Peg,\" cried he to her, as she paused for breath, \" do yow want a seat in the cucking-stool, or a flogging at a cart's tail ? \" and he grasped her by the wrist with a rough hand, as he spoke. \" Yow had best keep a quiet tongue in your ugly mouth.\" \" Aye,\" added another, \" and don't rail at the law. It hath a long arm for folk who don't know their own. If all Squire West suspects be true yow are like to be sent to Virginny after that brother o' yourn whenever he can catch yow. An' as for that long legged Field ; whose father warr buried only yesterday, let him take care how he claims whatn's left, or yow may go in company.\" The woman listened with a tigerish face ; then let loose her tongue again, but William had heard enough, and was off out of sight and hearing."], [227, "CHAPTER XV. A FRESH START. William had seen one execution, and though he had then been a little lad mounted on his father's shoulders, the lingering impression had not made him anxious to behold another. He had made no secret of the scene he had witnessed on the Saturday night, save only his recognition of the woman, having still a wholesome dread of vindictive evildoers, and her threat of revenge on future wayfarers seemed in some sort directed against himself, or he fancied so. Consequently he held aloof from the \" show \" on Gallows Hill that windy March morning. \" If I saw the jerk and struggles of the man when the cart was drawn away, I should never pass the spot night or morning without a shudder. Imagination would suspend him there and hold me fast. Let those look on who have no call that way in the twilight of dawn, or the dark of night.\" He said nothing of his fear of being recog-"], [228, "216 IN HIS OWN HAND. nized as one of the gaping crowd by the felon's unhanged associates. Thomas said he \" did not see why he should go out of his way and lose his own time and his master's just to see the bad end of a bad man, and spoil his appetite for dinner.\" But Mr. Finch betook himself and his snuff box to Gallows Hill, leaving Susannah to deal with his undusted books ; and not a contortion of the miserable wretch, not an item of his \" dying speech,\" did he spare his customers, William among the rest. The body had been handed over to the surgeons for dissection, and the gallows re moved before William, with his stick in his hand and his bag over his shoulder, trudged over the hill and through Thornywood along the Mansfield Road on the Saturday morning ; but though less superstitious than the ignorant masses, he looked aside over his shoulder once or twice somewhat uncomfortably, as if he half-expected to see the dead body dang ling there still, and was glad when it was broad day and the forest left behind with all its yellow primroses, blue hyacinths and ane mones, its song birds and the wild game for which men broke the laws and gave their lives or liberty. That Saturday Squire West and Madam passed his shop, both in mourning. He made"], [229, "A FRESH START. 217 a remark to a gaping rustic at the window that they must have respected schoolmaster Field ver)- much to put on black. The man stared at him with wide-open eyes. \"Whoy, dunna yow know? Theere i' black fur that lad o' theyrn they lost two months sin ! \" Oh, indeed ! \" said Will, and the man moved away as if amazed at the querist's ignorance. William had no particular interest in either the Squire or his wife beyond that hazy im pression of resemblance to some one he had known. (Catherine laughed at his imaginary likening of people to others.) They were not customers ; he was not a native or a resident of the neighbourhood, he was not even a father, and so the loss of a stranger's child two months back did not afflict him or excite farther curiosity. That the word \" lost \" meant by death he took for granted. He went and came \u2014 much more pleasantly now the days were lengthening. On the Saturday following Lady Day William found the quiet town all excitement. Lads who had made holiday since the death of schoolmaster Field were running to and fro, shouting to one another to \" come and see.\" There was quite a crowd round the close shut tered house of the dead man."], [230, "218 IN HIS OWN HANI). William could not forbear turning thither before opening his own shop. It appeared that lawyer Bulwell who held the key, and the owner of the house, had to gether gone thither for some unascertained reason, and to their astonishment discovered that the house had been stripped of everything it contained except a few articles of furniture too heavy and bulky for secret transport. Against the door of a great wooden press was nailed a boldly written paper. \" As my father's son and heir I have re moved nry own property. The landlord is welcome to the remainder for his rent. \"Francis Field.\" \" It's the vagabond's own handwriting and signature,\" quoth Lawyer Bulwell; \"I could take my affidavit of that. And no one could bar his right to remove the goods. Yrou may think well he has left sufficient to cover the rent due,\" addressing the landlord. \" That rogue Harris, who has been the ruin of Francis Field would have made a bonfire of the lot rather than pay a just debt. His debt to the gallows had been long overdue. The country is well rid of him and of his son too. I only wish they had transported him for life. But con victs do not often come back from the plan tations ; that is a comfort to honest men.\""], [231, "A FRESH START. 219 He turned to William Hutton \u2014 whose curi osity and something more had brought him there with others, and who stood near, think ing that, surely, now there would be a fresh start for Field, and a better home for Dolly \u2014 \" You who cross the common and the forest late and early, Mr. Bookseller, may be glad they have strung the ruffian up at last, as a caution to his gang. He was no friend to wayfarers carrying property,\" and he cast his eyes on the book-bag. \" At all events,\" he went on, \" we have proved the mysterious noises haunting the old house at night to have been made by ghosts of flesh and blood. I hope Field will put to good use the bit of cash he found. Yrou will soon find another tenant, Mr. Roper, perhaps one who will take the remaining furniture with the house.\" William's ear caught the name. He won dered if the stout farmer-like man could be the father of his uncle's old apprentice. He knew that half Joseph Roper's assumption had its origin in the easy circumstances of his parents. But, when William finally departed from Southwell in May the house was still empty and had an uncanny name. In May, when the hawthorns and the lilac bushes were in bloom and filled the air with incense, William Hutton was again in Birming ham ; the tenant of half a shop in Bull street, for"], [232, "220 TV HIS OWN HAND. which he agreed to pay the enormous rent of one shilling a week. He had put his past behind him, parted from old friends, severed old connections and associations, and torn himself with streaming tears from Catherine and Thomas to face an unknown future in an unknown town. The latter had composedly helped him to pack his stock, his tools and his press for the Birmingham carrier, and shook hands with him on the Thursday morning with a simple \" Good bj^e \" that said little of brotherly emotion whatever might be felt. But Catherine Perkins, though she felt as if the home she had created was shaken to its foundations by his' departure, had been throughout the active spirit to help it forward. She could not let any selfish motive stand in the way of her brother's welfare. Only a few weeks before, during William's absence, Mr. Rudsdall, her old master, had come to her. His wife was dead, and he was anxious for her to return to Gainsborough as his housekeeper. \"If not,\" he said, \"he should break up his house rather than have a stranger to manage for him.\" \" Nay,\" said Catherine. \" Here I have made a home for myself and brothers, and here my duty lies. True, William leaves to try his fortune in a more active and thriving"], [233, "A FRESH START. 221 town, but Thomas remains, and I have another brother out in the world who may be glad of a harbour of refuge some day. I can by my spinning-wheel support myself and have a surplus if needed. And that makes me inde pendent.\" \" You always were independent,\" said he with a smile, \" but how is it you encourage your brother Will to go among strangers ? \" \" It will be for his good. He will be thrown entirely on himself. That will bring out his latent energies. He has aspirations. Here the people remember him as a 'prentice lad who ran away from his uncle's stick. His old friends are mostly lounging frame-knitters. He will shake them off and form fresh asso ciations. I only wish he started with a better stock.\" \" Well,\" said Mr. Rudsdall, \" if you have made up your mind there is no turning you. And, as you put it, your duty does lie here. If I break up my house I shall not keep all my library. If William will act as my guide and travelling companion to Stamford, I will pay him for his trouble, and we can talk about it by the way.\" And so it came about that William, who got a thorough drenching on the way to Stamford, added to his stock about two hun dred-weight of books that came packed up in"], [234, "222 IN HIS OWN HAND. a corn-chest, and for which he was to pay but a nominal sum \" when he was able.\" To these Catherine had added a well-bound uniform set \u2014 the \"Spectator,\" \"Tattler,\" \" Guardian\" \u2014 about a dozen volumes in all. \" These are for show, not for sale,\" she said as she packed them in his box ; \" my old master gave them to me as a token of respect, and I only lend them to you on those conditions. The better a show you make as a start, the better will be your chances. And here are some new linen aprons, they are made from yarn of my own spinning, and Susannah Finch has helped to sew them.\" Then she gave him a few words of advice. \" Always wear your apron behind your counter, it will preserve your clothes, show you are your own bookbinder, and help to bring trade. Whatever you earn spend less ; don't mistake profit for capital ; never make a bargain to wrong another, and you'll get on, never fear. And mind, don't be too ready to pick up friends you might afterwards want to drop.\" Mr. Finch had made a great splutter over his going away, and went so far as to hint at his own great intentions towards the young man, but William glanced from the open snuff-box to the dusty shelves and said : \" Arrangements made must be kept.\""], [235, "A FRESH START. 223 The old fellow, hankering after the press he had almost given away, then said : \" You will not want to carry the old press with you. I will take it back at a fair price. It will not pay for carriage so far.\" \" Thank you, no. I prefer to keep it. It would cost me more than the carriage to buy a new one. There are years of work in it yet,\" as he put to the proof in the after-time. Susannah and his Aunt Ann had come to say \" farewell \" overnight, but though he might have noticed the reddened eyelids of the former, he made no display of more than friendly feeling. He had never been the same to her since he had seen Dolly Field in Charn wood, and if he had tendered no explanation he had not thought it necessary. Susannah had felt the change, but had no clue to its cause. And when he said \" good bye \" with out a word to make the parting a promise of another meeting she went home to sob her self to sleep. Indeed, it was only in leaving Catherine behind he had melted into tears. No woman was, in his mind, to be compared to her. She had been his friend, his counsellor, his prop ; Susannah Finch, merely a pretty girl to laugh and chat with in idle hours. And now that he was alone in his small shop, with the coarse voice of Mrs. Dix, who"], [236, "224 IX HIS OWN HAND. held the other half, sounding through the thin partition, he felt his desolation keenly. It was with a very grave face he set about the display of his stock in the window and on the few shelves, on one of which he mounted his oaken desk, whilst to his press he gave the most convenient and conspicuous corner. The corn chest served as a cutting and pasting table, and when at night he made himself up a bed under the counter, very little of the ela tion he brought with him remained to glorify his new enterprise. He thought of the cheerful home he had left, the hum of Catherine's wheel; the warm supper of porridge always ready for him, and, weary as he was, lay awake at least an hour and wondered if he had acted wisely. He might have left smiles and laughter behind him in Nottingham he wore so sober a countenance as he sat waiting for customers, but he took heart as he saw how many people passed, and in passing gave a glance at the window or stopped to read an open page against the glass, if only one or two ventured in to ask prices. Ticketing goods was an art unknown until the present century was more than thirty years old. His first customer was a bright little surgeon named Dowler, from over the way, who had seen his packages unloaded, and either from"], [237, "A FRESH START. 225 kindness or curiosity came to give him handsel. This was about mid-day, when William had found waiting for customers so monotonous that, as a relief, he had donned an apron, and was putting his press and tools in order to rebind an old book for occupation. The apron and the press together acted as Mrs. Perkins had predicted. \" Oh, you are a book binder I see. Have you any samples of your work ? \" Samples were laid before him, taken up and examined. \"Yes, the workmanship is good. I will bring you a book or so to bind. I like to encourage a new beginner.\" And after offer ing William a pinch of snuff from a silver box, he departed. He was as good as his word. \" Yes, this is satisfactory,\" said the surgeon, turning over the solidly bound volumes care fully tooled. \" I will show them to my friend, Francis Grace, the hosier, he can serve you if so inclined. What is your name ? \" \" William Hutton,\" was the brief answer, the owner of the name not caring to remind Mr. Grace of the runaway 'prentice who had gone sueing to him for employment as a frame-knitter, by claiming previous know ledge. vol. 1. 15"], [238, "226 IN 7775 OWN HAND. His reticence served no end. Francis Grace had a good memory as well as himself. \" William Hutton ? \" quoth he to the friendly surgeon. \" Aye, I heard of him when I was in Derby last. He ran away from the stock ing-frame, and came seeking work from me. I fear I was harsh with the lad. I heard that he had given up the frame for book binding, and was steady and persevering ; quite a con trast to his drunken old sot of a father. And as he hath come to Birmingham, well, we must give him a lift if he be a good workman and a fair dealer.\" The next day saw the drab-coated Quaker in his broad-brimmed hat, surveying William Hutton's shop outside and in, before he laid upon the counter a broken-backed copy of \" Fox's Book of Martyrs,\" and said : \" Friend Hutton, canst thou put a fresh back on my old book \u2014 as thou hast taken up with a fresh trade since I saw thee last \u2014 a good, strong, calf binding ; one to stand using? '' William saw that he was known and answered accordingly. \" I'll endeavour to suit you, Mr. Grace. A man generally does best that which he likes best. I took up book-binding to please my self. I was put to the silk mill and the stock ing loom to please others, and liked neither. Which style of binding do you prefer ? \""], [239, "A FRESH START. 227 Specimens were laid on the counter. Whilst looking them over the Quaker said : \"And why hast thou left Nottingham this time, eh? I know all about thy first running away, so thee may as well speak the truth now.\" William's colour rose. He replied : \" Well, sir, I took a liking to Birmingham. I saw the people busy, active and intelligent, and thought there was a better chance of success where no one could regard me as a Jack-of all-trades, if I proved myself master of one.' \" Is that a hint for me to be silent on what concerneth me not, eh ? At all events there is a ring of truth in that thou sayst. I have moreover heard a good report of thee in Derby, and am moved to help aspiring industry. If I can honestly commend thy work, I will for the sake of thy respected kins man. George Hutton, the stockinger, with whom I had many dealings. It may be for thy own sake also, if I find thee deserving.\" And having selected a pattern, the well-inten tioned Quaker went his way. The little air of patronage was unnoted by Will, or only noted as encouraging. Very few then dreamed of despising patronage or of rising without a patron. \" This looks well,\" said he to himself. \" Two book binding orders in the first week, and two friends made. I may find a fortune in my 15\u20142"], [240, "228 IN HIS OWN HAND. old press after all? But am I never to hear the last of nry runaway folly ? I thought in coming here I had turned my back on the past, and here I am face to face with it again. No matter, if Mr. Grace keeps silent, there is no one else to reproach me.\" Six weeks later Catherine and poor Susan nah Finch, who had given her heart before she knew the gift had no value, between them stirred up sluggish Thomas to visit his brother, and ascertain what cause he had for the melancholy tone of his letters. \" What's the matter with you, Will ? \" he asked. \" You look as grave as a monument. Have you no trade ? \" \" Pretty fair for a new beginner. The trade hath fully supported me. I have not allowed my expenses to exceed five shillings a week, so there hath been a surplus to extend my stock. But I am lonely.\" \" Lonely with all these books about you ? \" droned out Thomas in surprise. \" Have you no time to read?\" \" Yes, and I do read. But. I cannot shut my life and soul up in a book as you do, Thomas. My heart asks for human friend ship and sympathy. My tongue and my limbs are stiff from want of exercise. My mind feels like a stagnant pond with the duckweed grow ing over it.':"], [241, "A FRESH START. 229 Thomas shook his head. He did not under stand the case, and said so. \" Books to read !

Do you go to meet ing ? \" \" No, I am ashamed of my old coat.\" \" Then I'm ashamed of you. If you cannot thank God for the blessings you have in the best He has bestowed you deserve no better, and Catherine would tell you so.\" A new idea seemed to illuminate his face and brain. \"Mappen you are pining after some girl in Nottingham. Is it Susannah Finch ? Catherine takes to her.\" \" I'm not pining for any girl. Dolly Parker gave me a sickening of them.

As your trade im proves so will your spirits.\" \" Ah, Thomas, I am not framed for mono tony, you are.

He went back to report that Will was thriving, but pining for companionship. He thought for some sweetheart. Whereat Sus annah Finch was comforted. She must have patience and wait."], [243, "CHAPTER XVI. RECOGNITIONS. Slowly trod the steeds of Time for William, but they trod golden-footed. Before the year had completed its cycle he had saved twenty pounds, paid Mr. Rudsdall, added new books to his old stock, and an intelligent friend or two to his list. Melancholy vanished before prosperity. He was induced to listen to the persuasions of Dr. Dowler and Mr. Grace, and shift his quarters to more commodious premises, namely, the shop and house adjoining Mr. Grace's in the Gateway. It must be understood that from the steep and open Bull Ring (at the bottom of which St. Martin's Church lay perdue among houses), and which within its area held the bull stake, the town pump, the shambles, the Old Market Cross, and the general market, the road gradually narrowed into the High Town \u2014 afterwards High Street \u2014 until behind the Welsh Cross it forked off left and right through narrow Bull Street to Wolver-"], [244, "TV 7775 OWN HAXD. 232 hampton, and through wider Dale End to Coleshill. The New Street of fair red brick and stone, graced by the Free Grammar School, and rows of stately trees, with here a garden, there a cottage in its midst, should have opened fairly out of the High Town at a right angle on the left, but for three obstruc tive houses, which partially blocked the end of the street, leaving only a narrow entrance on the north, covered by a portion of Mr. Grace's house. And these obstructive build ings were known as the Gateway. The pile had originally been the Leather Hall, when leather formed the staple trade of the town, and the office of leather-seller was not a mere sinecure. It also contained the Town Hall, and the Toll House where market and excise dues were paid. It may be supposed it had been a fine building in its time, pargetted between the beams, and having pargetted walls within. It had so long been converted into dwellings that its old name had lapsed. The swine market was held in New Street, in the immediate rear of this gateway, and the beast market very little farther away in High Town. The vicinity could not be either fragrant or quiet, but the Post Office, where all the new mail coaches stopped, was also in New Street, and consequently the cramped entrance, barely wide enough for a vehicle to"], [245, "RECOGNITIONS. 233 pass, was a busy thoroughfare, and the ancient gateway a good business location. For some time the sluggish blood of the Buttons had been at issue with the energetic fluid of the Wards. i \" What! venture on a house without furni ture, and on a rent of eight pounds. The suggestion is appalling ! I might lose all I have made ! \" he argued. \" And thee might multiply it twenty-fold. If thee hast made anything in thy half-shop, thee may surely make more in a whole one under improved conditions. There is not a better spot for trade in all the town. I have tried it,\" urged the friendly Mr. Grace. \" Pah ! you are already cramped for space here. The premises are dirty. Mrs. Dix at her door would frighten ladies awajr with her coarse tongue and arms akimbo. Y^our busi ness is expanding, you already need more room for both books and bookbinding. Be sides, if you mean to invite trade you must make a show, for which there is no room here.\" This was the argument of Dr. Dowler, backed by the offer of his snuff-box for a companion pinch. \" Make a show ! \" Those were weighty words to throw into the fluctuating balance of William Hutton's mind. It had ever been his aim to make a good appearance."], [246, "234 IN HIS OWN HAND. Early in the new year he had taken posses sion of the newly-painted and stencilled premises adjoining Mr. Grace. He had made some little alterations in fixtures with his own ready hands, displayed his goods, set up his press where he could be seen at work in his white apron, which held a pocket for small tools ; and ere long a swinging sign displayed to all who could run and read, that William Hutton was at once a Bookseller, Bookbinder, and \" Lent Books on Hire.\" For no one had that sign such fascination as for himself. The sight of his own name there emblazoned was an assurance that he had taken a step forward, and taken it boldly. He was proud of his own daring, and trod the empty floors of the strong old house with a full sense of his own importance as a tradesman and a householder. Yet, a common table, a couple of chairs, and a squab-sofa to serve as a bed, with a few articles of ironware and crockery, were all he could boast in the way of furniture, if we include the tinder-box, the candlesticks for his shop counter, and their attendant snuffers and tray. But even that was an advance from the bed under the counter, and he sat down at night in his back-parlour to cast up his accounts, read a book or compose a poem, smiling on fortune since fortune smiled on him."], [247, "RECOGNITIONS. 235 He indulged in no extravagances, his diet was frugal as ever, he had no servants, no errand boy \u2014 customers in those days did not disdain to carry home their own purchases \u2014 he was attentive and conversable, knew some thing more than the outsides of the books he sold, people who came once came twice, either to hire or to buy ; and his expenses being of the lightest his profits were profits. For five years he had not indulged in the luxury of a new best coat. The death of a Royal Duke gave him an opportunity to dis play at once his loyalty and his stability by ordering a full suit of black broadcloth from a draper in the Bull Ring, whom he paid in advance. He was alone in his shop when the clothes were brought home. The bearer, a bow-legged little fellow, with watery eyes, set up a shout of surprised recognition as he laid his parcel on the counter and fixed his eyes on the face of William. \" Whoy, is that yo ? Wheere's yor rnester ? \" \" I have no master.\" \" No mester ? Dun yo meean to say yo're Mr. Hutton, th' mester o' this shop, an' that them cloathes I've bin stitchin' an' pressin' be fur yo ? \" \" Certainly I do.\" \" Sartenly yo do ! \" he said with a sneer"], [248, "236 IN HIS OWN HAND. which struck off into something like exasper ation. \" Then yo han had th' devil's own luck sin' I fell in wi' yo on th' road to Lunnon, mester ! Yo wur poor enough then ; hadna so much as a penny to spare fur a pint o' ale to wet yor whistle ! \" William Hutton was wofully anno57ed. The man's tones were not low and silvery ; he was afraid lest passers-by should overhear. For a moment he hesitated whether he should repu diate his own identity and deny all knowledge of the little tailor. But with Francis Grace for so near a neighbour it did not do to risk an angry altercation on such a subject, and he could not, moreover, resist the opportunity to preach a sermon on his favourite text. \" If I had spent my pennies in whetting my whistle, Tommy Green, I should never have been the master of this shop, or any other. My luck hath been the luck of frugal indus try. Every man hath his fortune in his own hand. The hand of Industry gathers, the hand of Indolence scatters. If your needles had stitched up a bag to preserve the pennies you have spent in pints, you might have been your own master by this time.\" \" Nowt o' th' soart !

The string may serve again. Unthriftiness in small mat ters will keep a man poor. To thrive one must save as well as get. You see the knot is untied.\" \" Ugh ! It's ill arguing between a full pocket an' a empty un. If thah's lit o' thy feet I hanna. F th'parts I come from they dunna think much o' a bit o' bant. I dunna belong here.

Anny cock can crow on its own dunghill ! He'd best not crow over me anny more.\" And so on, until he washed down his words but not his envy with his first pint of ale. The ale bought with pence acquired by steady hard work, self denial, and minute savings. Did Tommy Green thank the giver of pence or lesson ? Not he. He had snatched at the wrap, and taken the gratuity with only a feeling of resent ment against the giver, because he was in a position to give. How he had risen did not concern the envious little tailor. That the man he had met on the road seemingly as poor as himself had in two years become master of a good shop, whilst he sat stitching on another man's shop-board for what would barely keep him in meat and drink, made the ale as gall and wormwood to him. The very contrast of the bookseller's upright bearing and sturdy build with his own unshapely limbs served to embitter him still more. Altogether, whether with his personal superiority, his success or his preaching, or all combined, he had made an enemy for life of the insignificant little tippling tailor."], [251, "RECOGNITIONS. 239 The man had not overrated his dexterity with his needle, but the sharp little implement often lay idle, his tongue never did. It was that which led to quarrels, and quarrels to fisti cuffs between himself and his mates. Over his ale can he vented his spleen at the \" upstart bookbinder.\" Many ears are open in a public-house, and the credit of a new comer into a neighbourhood is easily sapped. Then on he went to his employers to lower \" the coxcomb \" there. William Hutton's shop after all could be no great matter compared with the older ones of Aris, and Warren, and a suggestiveness of instability found ready credence where least expected. As a householder, Mr. Hutton was, of course, answerable for ordinary rates, or levies. Much to his surprise, he was summoned before the Overseers. There he was closely ques tioned respecting his means and his birth-place, as a matter of parish settlement ; and he was not only coarsely told to produce the certificate of his baptism, but threatened with removal from the town unless he complied, since they expected he would become a bankrupt, and chargeable upon the parish. It was in vain he assured them he was sol vent, that he paid for his goods with cash, that he offered the money for the levies. To have accepted them would have been to have"], [252, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 240 given him a settlement in Birmingham. The offer was rejected with contempt. \" Produce your certificate ! \" was all the voice of autho rity would say. This he could not do. In reply to him his father only wrote, \" I am very sorry, Bill, but All Saints', Derby, does not grant certificates.\" There was another appearance before the Overseers, another scene of badgering and browbeating, another refusal of the levies tendered. And so from time to time the con test was renewed, and so, though his trade increased, he was persecuted with insulting implications ; and although his friends Dr. Dowler and Mr. Grace vouched for his character and responsibility, he was kept on the tenter-hooks of fear lest he should be dislodged. Naturally enough, he attributed this to the ill-nature of trade rivalship ; to the resent ment of established booksellers against an interloper who had presumed to check book selling by book lending. He never sought for a cause so low as the spiteful tongue of a little journeyman tailor. He had put on his glossy black suit, and surveyed himself as well as he could in his small looking-glass, on the Sunday morning, without a second thought of Tommy Green. More than satisfied with his own appear-"], [253, "RECOGNITIONS. 241 ance, he added a new three-cornered hat to his equipment, and a silver-capped stick that had once belonged to Mr. Webb, and joined the stream of loyal black-coated individuals on their way to the New Meeting House in Digbeth, not as heretofore to take a seat in an obscure corner, but to walk down the aisle to a seat he could call his own. The new Meeting House was a long plain building with a single row of lights, and was entered by a couple of doors on either side a high window at the western end. Each door led to a separate aisle. As William Hutton walked down the one, a young man already seated in a square pew on the opposite aisle fixed his eyes upon him with a sort of bewildered recognition. Once or twice during the service William chanced to look that way and their eyes met. \" I have seen that gentleman somewhere before,\" was the thought of each. As the congregation dispersed they left the Meeting House by different doors, and very shortly William Hutton heard a voice at his elbow saying, \" YAmr servant, sir. I think we have met somewhere before. Have you any remembrance ? \" William coloured to the roots of his hair. (He had never mounted a fresh wig). Was he never to put his past behind him ? Was vol. I. 16"], [254, "242 IN HIS OWN HAND. he so remarkable that neither years nor dress could efface the 'prentice lad ? The brisk, cheery voice that addressed him was scarcely needed as a reminder of the speaker, for he had been well dressed when they had met eleven years before. There was a little lingering false shame in William Hutton's reply. \"Yes, sir, I remember you well, and I remember how kindly you directed an unfor tunate lad to Mr. Grace the hosier.\" The other eyed him over. \"You must have prospered since then.\" \"Yes, sir, but not at the stocking-frame. I am the bookseller, next door to Mr. Grace in the Gateway. My name is William Hutton.\" \" Indeed, and mine is William Ryland. There ought to be good-will between us ; I am pleased to hear of your success, and will give you a call before long.\" The one call led to many and to life-long friendship and fellowship. Hutton's poems were about that time finding their way into magazines. Mr. Ryland introduced him to other members of the congregation as a book seller and a poet ; and ere long his circulat ing library became the resort both of ladies and gentlemen, who found him alike con versable and obliging. Indeed he was vain enough to imagine that one or two of the"], [255, "RECOGNITIONS. 243 former who railed him on his bachelorhood, would not have objected to have put an end to it. But, the freedom of the period not withstanding, he was proof against feminine advances. He had had his \" all sufficient warning \" from a girl he had loved. He had grown fastidious. Notwithstanding the persecution of the Overseers, his trade was extending, and with it his ideas. Sundry articles of furniture had found their way into his house, but a feminine hand was lacking to arrange and put in order. Bed and windows were curtainless and bare, and so he told his sister Catherine when he wrote. He had an answer back from Mrs. Perkins very promptly. \"Nottingham, August 24, 1751. \" Dear William, \u2014 \"I hope you are well as this leaves us at the present. You want a good wife to keep you and your house in order. I will come and make all orderly and comfortable for you. I shall bring with me a young lady I think will suit you well for a wife. You need not leave your shop to meet us at the carrier's inn. Saturday is no day to neglect business ; and I can find my way. Samuel hath come back to Nottingham. Roving hath not done much for 16\u20142"], [256, "7Y 777S OWN HAND. 244 him. He is in a sad plight. Aunt Ann and her husband claim him as a runaway 'prentice on the old indentures. I stand out against it, since Uncle George is dead, and Aunt Ann cannot teach him frame-knitting. Robert Tanner offers to teach him whip-making. I have not yet decided what to do for him. But he is now eighteen, with no trade in his fingers to earn a living by. Thomas jogs on in the old course : works, reads, eats, sleeps. Nottingham was shaken by an earthquake yesterday, which threw the whole town into consternation. Thomas came home from his work as composed as if nothing had occurred to disturb him. You need not provide for us. I shall bring my own provisions and my own sheets. Until we meet, \" I remain, \" Your affectionate sister, \" Catherine Perkins. William read the letter more than once. He had now been his own master and man ager for nearly two years, and something jarred against his sense of independence. \" Catherine's a wonderful woman, not her equal anywhere,\" he said ; \" but matrimony is a man's own concern. I prefer choosing a wife for myself. Surely the young lady can not know Catherine's intention ! If she does,"], [257, "RECOGNITIONS. 245 she is no wife for me. Tastes change with time ; what suited me in the old days will not suit me now. I am rising. I must have a wife with manners and education ; one who can rise with me. Besides, there is no hurry \u2014 if Catherine thinks so. I can hire a house keeper, as Mr. Grace advises, and I could get an apprentice but for those ill-natured Over seers, and their threat to remove me. It would be folly to marry with that hanging over me, whoever our Catherine may have brought. I've grown dainty since the days when Dolly Parker could enslave me. Poor Dolly, I wonder what has become of her and her children ! If Francis Field made good use of his father's little property they may have a comfortable home now. Surely the old man's death would act as a check to him. So should the hanging of Harris. I heard that his shrewish daughter had been whipped through the streets of Nottingham. I wonder if it was true ? \" And so William's thoughts wandered from the subject ofthe letter before him, as he sat cogitating alone in his carpetless back parlour after his shop was shut, with a single mould candle to light up the gloom. It was not weather for a fire. Presently, apropos of nothing, he broke out, \" I wonder what that niece of Mr. Grace"], [258, "246 IN HIS OWN HAND. is like now ? He said she was coming to keep house for him. She does not hurry. I am curious to see her. She was a sweet little child.\" Then after a pause, \" I must make some preparation for Catherine and her friend. A bachelor's house like mine might scare a sensitive young lady. No carpets, no looking glasses, no china, no soft cushions ! I must be up betimes in the morning to see what such things will cost. Catherine is not wise to bring a strange young lady here. No matter, I am making friends of my own. An improving position demands improved sur roundings \u2014 within reason. I wish I knew who Catherine's new friend can be ! What lady can she know ? \" There was certainly no inner prompting. When Mrs. Perkins, heavily laden, walked into his shop on the Saturday afternoon, with her companion, he opened wide both eyes and mouth, dumb with astonishment."], [259, "CHAPTER XVII. mrs. Perkins's mistake. Miss Finch was the travelling companion of Mrs. Perkins ! A momentary contraction of William's lips and brows succeeded his blank amazement before he put forth his hand or said a word of kindly greeting. Miss Finch blushed, .smiled, caught his change of countenance, cast down her eyes, and looked foolish. \" Ah ! She knows \u2014 shows her conscious ness ! Susannah, you are as artful as your father,\" was his unspoken verdict, as he put out his hand first to his sister, then to her, and ushered them into his back parlour with as much cordiality as he could muster up. \" So ! this is the young lady, is she? Catherine has thought to catch me in a trap, and she has lent herself to the trick ! \" Utterly unjust were his suspicions, but Susannah's embarrassment only confirmed them. She had come with Mrs. Perkins readily enough, perhaps too readily, nothing doubting"], [260, "248 IN HIS OWN HAND. her welcome, and clinging to a straw of hope, but that one glance at William's face had told her that she was as undesired as unexpected, and she wished herself a thousand miles away. Even Catherine Perkins saw that something was wrong, but she never struck her colours and never owned to defeat. She set down the heavy basket she was carrying, and with one roving glance around the room \u2014 the satisfactory appointment of which had cost William thought, time, and monejr \u2014 took in the whole, from the iron grate that held the fire instead of the open hearth, the copper kettle singing on the hob, the mahogany tea-board with its Staffordshire tea-ware \u2014 handleless cups and saucers a shade less tiny than their foreign-china prototypes \u2014 the brass fender and handirons, the square of carpet across the hearth, the new oaken chairs and the older squab sofa, the corner cup board, the old oak desk on a shelf by the fire, and a pile of untidy books on the floor under the cupboard. Her face softened as she noted the evident preparations for their coming. \" Um ! Things are more comfortable than I expected, for a bachelor,\" she said approv ingly ; \" but you do want a woman here to sweep away the cobwebs and smarten you up a bit.\""], [261, "MRS. PERKINS'S MISTAKE. 249 Cobwebs ! He had seen no cobwebs, had not thought of them. \u25a0O \" What an eye Catherine has ! \" he said to himself. \" But she has opened fire too soon.\" Aloud he observed, \" I am looking for a servant.\" \" You need someone,\" was her quick response, and then she turned to Susannah, who was still standing, and said, \" Sit down, child, and give me the bag,\" referring to one Susannah had brought with her. A tap on the counter summoned William into his shop. \" Where shall we put our apparel ? \" asked Catherine. \" Upstairs.\" And he was gone, thinking as he went, \" I'd not have spent so much had I known the lady was Susannah Finch. Less might have served her.\" The stairs were not far to seek. Only a brown door shut them off from the room, into which the lowest stair obtruded, and only a square hole in the inclosing partition gave light to the stairway. Up they went to the apartment above the shop. There were the same signs of prepara tion. The floor had been scrubbed \u2014 after a fashion \u2014 the curtainless bed was not new, the chairs and table had evidently done duty downstairs, but the strips of carpet and the"], [262, "250 IN HIS OWN HAND. small swing looking-glass were luxuries, and new. Whether this had been done to honour her self or the lady she might bring, there is no question that Mrs. Perkins felt proud of the brother who had by dint of industry, frugality, and shrewdness laid by a sum he could draw upon at will. She had been striving and saving nearly all her life, but he was the only one of her brothers who had shown a hke capacity. But furniture alone did not make a home comfortable in her sight ; there was wanting the super-cleanliness of which her own dwell ing was so bright an example. There was dust in corners and on ledges where only a woman would have looked for it, dust that had lingered long undisturbed. The floor scrubbing had been a very sorry affair, and the bed making was no better. \" We will show him what women can do before we go back,\" said Mrs. Perkins smartly, as she remade the bed, substituting her own sheets for the coarse ill-washed ones she found there. \" I think I will go back with the carrier on Monday,\" sighed Susannah timidly, \" Mr. Hutton does not want me here ; 1 ought not to have come uninvited.\" \" Nonsense, child. I invited you. We"], [263, "MRS. PERKINS'S MISTAKE. 251 must teach him to want you before we go back. I know what I'm about.\" Susannah opened her eyes and looked bewildered. Mrs. Perkins had let a flood of light in upon her that dazed her. For the first time she saw why she had been invited, and wondered how Mrs. Perkins had pene trated her secret, little wotting how transparent it had been. \" Oh, Mrs. Perkins ! \" was all she could say, but she followed her downstairs in a 'flutter and confusion sure to be misinterpreted. When William's customer was gone he found the tea made and a loaf of Catherine's own baking on the table. Likewise a couple of fowls ready cooked, and a large piece of boiled bacon, whilst kidney beans, lettuces, and onions from her own garden still remained at the bottom of her big basket, as she did not fail to tell him. \" I knew you had no cook, so I brought fowls ready dressed to avoid cooking on the Sunday, so that we might go with you to the meeting.\" She seated herself at the table and began to pour out the tea, and order him and Sus annah to do this or that as in the old days in her own house, and he felt as if his own mastership was slipping away from him. Her \" Come, Susannah, cut the bread and"], [264, "IN HIS OWN HAND. 252 butter,\" was anything but reassuring. It seemed as if they had taken possession of him and his house, and Susannah was being set in some sort of authority there. Her very em barrassment, instead of exciting sympathy, told against her. At the same time as he talked to them of their two days' j ourney in the waggon among boxes and baskets, and helped himself plenti fully to the bread and butter she had cut, he confessed to himself it was pleasant to have some one to wait on him, and to keep him company over the evening meal. Then he found the cup of warm tea more refreshing than the mug of ale or milk with which he was wont to accompany his customary hunch of bread, as often eaten without cheese or butter as with it. But it did not make him one whit the better pleased with Susannah Finch. He inwardly resented the way in which she had been intro duced with a set purpose, and when on the morrow after a breakfast of milk porridge, which Catherine had prepared, they came down stairs equipped for the Meeting House, he would gladly have dispensed with their company had it been possible to escape. Not that there was anything vulgar or unbecoming in their attire \u2014 if there had been he was scarcely a judge \u2014 Catherine never"], [265, "MRS. PERKINS'S MISTAKE. 253 wore a hoop, and at all times dressed with as much simplicity as a Quakeress. Her gown was of soft grey silk, had been the best dress of Mr. Rudsdall's dead wife, becomingly altered. Her bonnet was of new black satin, without fashionable eccentricities. Susannah, on the contrary, had her long stomachered dress of purple tabinet, slightly inflated by a flexible hoop, whilst the hood of her scarlet capuchin set off her unpowdered black hair. There were silver buckles on her high-heeled shoes, aud her arms were cased in long gloves. Mr. Finch had sent her forth to the best of his ability, and if she failed to make a conquest, it was no fault of his. William would have been proud to escort his quiet and dignified sister \u2014 five years his elder \u2014 anywhere, but he felt wofully discon certed on being called upon to parade a smartly-dressed young girl, all blushes, down the aisle of the new Meeting House in the face of so many customers and acquaintances, who were sure to rally him on his gallantry after wards. Not that he was at all bashful, or would have felt the same hesitation in Nottingham where both were known ; but now that he was aiming at something higher than he had been or was, and had been noticed by people"], [266, "254 7Y 7775 OWN HAND. of position in his adopted town, he felt the need of treading cautiously, and instead of giving his full attention to the primitive service, fancied himself a mark for all eyes. As they came out, one or another nodded to him, as he thought, significantly ; Mr. Ryland shook hands with him, and asked, if looks could ask, for an introduction. In giving it, William Hutton was careful to say, not merely \" My sister, Mrs. Perkins,\" but \" Miss Finch, my sister's friend,\" so fearful was he of any misconstruction on either side. The cautious distinction smote Susannah's ear painfully. Her heart fell. The graceful courtesy which should have acknowledged such introduction at that time was wanting. She felt her own awkwardness, and William felt it too. He was little better pleased when at the gateway the two whipped off their head gear, and mounting large coverall aprons, laid the cloth and set the dinner on the table whilst he looked on ; and then cleared away the dishes when all was over. He invited them afterwards to take a walk round the town, and showed them all he thought most noteworthy : St. Philip's Church, the Blue Coat School, the fine new house Mr. Baskerville, the japanner, had just built"], [267, "MRS. PERKINS'S MISTAKE. 255 for himself in a quiet suburban spot he called Easy Hill, and which seemed to have a special attraction for him ; but all his con versation on what they saw, or what they had left behind in Nottingham, was addressed to both impartially. His disposition was too cheerful to admit of sullenness or ill-humour ; he had long been lonely, and he liked his company too well to be bearish or unmannerly, but he never lowered his voice, or spoke aside to Susannah, never showred by lingering glance, or touch, or tone, that she was more to him than another, wlnlst she, poor girl, in every look or movement told where she had set all the aspirations of her heart. That night, she again proposed that she and Mrs. Perkins should return home with the carrier's waggon on the morrow. \" Nothing of the sort. I came here to put William's house in order. I don't go back until it is done. You will have to help me. I intend him to see what a difference a woman makes in a house, and what a clever, active girl you are. Because he found a slut tish hovel in Charnwood, and heard the wife had been a pretty girl and a belle before she married, and moreover because your father's shop was grimy and dusty, he seems afraid to venture on a wife, and to have turned"], [268, "256 7Y 7775 OWN HAND. against you, my lass. I know you are not accountable for the grime in your father's shop, and I must convince William that he was mistaken before we go back.\" Accordingly he was called upon to disburse money for brushes and pails, and from top to bottom the place underwent a thorough cleansing and brightening. Next, a quantity of blue-checked gingham had to be bought, and two industrious needles transformed it into curtains and valances for bed and win dows. His two table-cloths and his sheets were hemmed, his crockery set in order, his squab so far had a new cover to match the curtains, and the windows were made to see through. She sent Susannah out to market, she set her to cook, and William looked on the result well pleased. But he felt the \" intention \" of it all, and his heart was closed as with a door. He had never been in love with Susannah Finch, and love was not to be forced. He had liked her well, and liking might have ripened into love, had not the glimpse he had of Dolly, and the dirt to which she had de scended, set him against the girl who could find time to come seeking him \u2014 so his vanity suggested \u2014 when her father's shop cried aloud for a brush and a duster. He did not know that old Finch had \" a mortal dread of a"], [269, "MRS. PERKINS'S MISTAKE. 257 dusting woman among his books.\" Y^ears before, William had himself felt the pangs of unrequited love. It is to be feared he had less sympathy with Susannah Finch's wounded affection than it deserved. He might not know how she had been thrown in his way, but he must have known he had paid her some gratuitous attention, and that he was scarcely justified in his sudden cold ness. In guarding himself against possible disappointment, he had not sufficiently thought what hers might be. Something of this Catherine had told him, and warmly, on the morning of their depar ture, whilst Susannah was packing her travel ling-bag upstairs. Something else had occur red to ruffle her equable temper besides his evident dislike to have a wife forced upon him. Catherine had inquired for the volumes she had lent him on show. \" As you have now a good stock, and can no longer need them, they can go back with us in my basket.\" Her brother looked confounded. After some stammering and hesitation, he confessed that he had \" sold them.\" She jumped to her feet. \"Sold them!\" she exclaimed, \" sold the books my master gave me as a token of respect ! Sold them ! vol. 1. 17"], [270, "258 7_V HIS OWN HAND. after your solemn promise that you woidd keep them clean, and never part with them until I recalled my own! I am ashamed of your want of principle. I blush for you.\" \" Do not say so, Catherine ; I really could not help it. Once or twice I could have sold them before, but when Mr. Baskerville had set his mind on them, I was afraid of offend ing a good customer, and really did not know how to refuse them.\" \" And prithee who is this Mr. Baskerville, whose custom could make j7ou break your solemn promise? Who is this stranger you were more afraid of offending than me ? \" she said, with unwonted severity. \" I showed you his grand house last Sun day. It is a wonderful place inside. The staircase and firegrates are of fine wrought iron, for which he made his own designs. He is a japanner, and has had a business in Birmingham for several years, but he does not belong to the town, he comes from a village called Wolverly, in Worcestershire.\" Mrs. Perkins evinced signs of impatience. She interrupted him. \" What has that to do with my book* ! \" \" Well, he is turning printer, and moulding his own types for superior book-work. Of course, he will require paper and binding in large quantities. I hope to become his paper"], [271, "MRS. PERKINS'S MISTAKE. 259 merchant. Should I have been wise to have exposed myself, and offended him by avowing that the books were not mine, and only kept on my shelves for show ? He hath been very gracious hitherto, and a \" \" You forgot your past obligations to me and bowed to the rising sun. It may be I have no right to blame you, since in lending you the books for show only, I myself prompted deception. But I am not the less annoyed and displeased.\" And she showed it, for her face had as warm a tinge as her hair, guiltless of powder. Many were his apologies, but the fact remained. She was not disposed to overlook it. Presently he unlocked his desk, and from a little bag produced five guineas, and laid them on the table before her. \" I know I am under the very greatest obli gations to you, Catherine,\" he said, \" the greatest are those I can never repay, but whilst you are here it becomes me to return somewhat of your loans to me. I had first ten guineas and then three; here are five. That will leave me eight in your debt. If I had not spent so much in preparing for an unknown visitor, there would have been more for you.\" There might have been a little taint of acrimony in his tone as he said this, for Catherine's prompt return was,"], [272, "260 IN HIS OWN HAND. \" I did not look for repayment till you were firmly established, but I did expect a warmer reception for Susannah. She hath done all she could to make your home snug and com fortable.

She must possess my highest affection and esteem, and I do not perceive any strong leaning towards Miss Finch in my breast.\" \"You are either very fickle, William, or you have found a new sweetheart in Birming ham. Take care you do not go through the wood and take up the crooked stick at last.\" \" I am not half through the wood yet,\" and he laughed, but he had certainly displeased his strong-willed sister, and did not himself feel conscience-clear over his conduct to Susannah Finch. But he let them depart, his sister too inde pendent and too indignant to accept his escort to the carrier's, Miss Finch discouraged and abashed. \"We came by ourselves heavily laden, we can surely return by ourselves having lighter loads,\" was the decided rebuff of the former, as she proffered her hand to his clasp, not her cheek to his kiss."], [273, "MRS. PERKINS'S MISTAKE. 261 \"No, thank you, Mr. Hutton ; I need no gift to remind me of this visit, and I cannot accept such a return for small services rendered to a friend,\" said Susannah, with more of maidenly reserve and wounded delicacy than he had counted on as she quietly put back a pair of bright steel shoe-buckles he had proffered, \" as a memento of the visit, and in return for her kind housewifery.\" Her hand trembled for a moment in his clasp, but there was no lover-like pressure as he shook it at parting, and she followed the erect figure of Mrs. Perkins up the High Town in the early moiTiing, glad there were so few people about to observe her humid eyes and discomposed countenance.
