Saturday, Aug. 22, 1840. \u2014 Among the various vexations of life, (I mean not its real ills, but the many trines that annoy and irritate) few things are more disagreeable than the bedside apparition of one's maid, with a candle in her hand, at four o'clock in the morning. It was, however, my fate to suffer from such a visitation on the above mentioned day, when, after quickly completing our preparations, we hurried to the Tower Stairs, and embarked on board the Giraffe steamer, which was to start for Rotterdam precisely at seven. b 2"], [22, "4 START FOR ROTTERDAM. Leaving England, however agreeable our pro spects, or bright our anticipations may be, always gives rise to anxious and mournful thoughts ; the mind tries to pierce the long, dark vista before it, and to divine what the coming months may have in store, of good or ill ; and the uncertainty in which it remains after all its efforts, leaves a shade of fear and gloom. I was roused from these reflections by an old foreigner coming on board, quarrelling with a waterman, who had tried to cheat him of a shilling. He was a respectable-looking man, and began a piteous complaint of the impositions of English people in their dealings with strangers. I could not help thinking, while commiserating this vic tim of cab-drivers and watermen, that foreigners have their revenge when English people wander abroad. There were two cabins and a saloon on deck, and to one of the former I soon retreated, and suc ceeded in making myself tolerably comfortable. The advantage of not going below is so great, that I am surprised this plan is not more general. The"], [23, "ROTTERDAM. 5 enjoyment of light and fresh air greatly alleviates, if it does not altogether prevent suffering. The weather was lovely, and for the first seven hours we glided on without apparent motion. The night was hot, with frequent flashes of lightning ; the sea became rough, and most of the passengers were ill. At two o'clock in the morning we stopped, as I was informed, for want of water \u2014 a singular deficiency in the middle of the sea ! At seven o'clock, however, we proceeded, and, having taken in a Dutch pilot, and been boarded by a custom-house officer, we reached Rotterdam at twelve, and were received by the consul, Sir Alex ander Ferrier, who conducted us to the Hotel des Pays Bas. Being Sunday, all the people were dressed in their gayest attire, and the promenade was full, and looked very gay ; but, after spending thirty hours in a steamer, we were more inclined to rest than to explore. Since I had been at Rotterdam, four years before, the navigation of the Rhine had greatly progressed ; the boats are now numerous, and, as we were told, are admirably managed,"], [24, "6 ANTWERP. and, from the great competition, the fares are very low. Captain Chaplin (at whose military academy, near Namur, our son was placed) arrived, and de cided us to go by Brussels to see him. Accord ingly, we hired the pavilion of a small steamer that was to start for Antwerp that night, and perform her passage in twelve hours. I cannot say much for the cleanliness of this temporary habitation, but, on one point, at least, it would be unjust to deny its due ; for I never, during my whole ex istence, heard such a noise ; Bedlam seemed broke loose all night ; and I was truly glad when we arrived, soon after one o'clock, at Antwerp ; and, leaving the luggage to be examined at the custom house, and conveyed to the railway, where we were to find it at four o'clock, we hastened to the cathedral. The town was in a great bustle, this being the last of the fifteen days devoted to the fete of Rubens. All the vessels had their colours flying, the people wore their gayest dresses, and crowds were assembling to crown the statue of the great"], [25, "CATFLEDRAL. 7 painter, of whom they are so justly proud. This ceremony only occurs once in a hundred years, and this is but the second time it has been cele brated. Fine triumphal arches had been erected ; but I was told the finest sight of all was the illu mination of the shipping with coloured lamps. This had cost the town .\u00a35000. The cathedral is a beautiful Gothic building, with a lofty tower and spire ; the second tower was never finished. Rubens's \" Descent from the Cross\" is a magnificent picture, and very superior to its companion, \" the Ascent.\" The Ascension is over the altar, and is also splendid, and as vie stood, the rays of the sun fell on it, and displayed it to the greatest advantage. From hence we hurried to the Musee, where the Crucifixion, also by Rubens, claims the tra veller's admiration. There are many other pic tures by the same master, and the collection is rich in Vandykes ; but unfortunately we had not time to examine them, or to go to the church of St. Jaques, which contains some splendid paintings. We paid a passing visit to Mr. Baillie, the great"], [26, "8 RAILWAY. shawl merchant, and bought some of the cele brated black silk for which Antwerp is famed. We then drove to the railway, where we found a scene of unequalled confusion. In consequence of the fete, 10,000 people required accommodation. The directors put on more carriages, and preached patience. We had great difficulty in getting places, and only succeeded after a smart contest between Lord L. and some insolent priest. The trains on this railway are not fast, and make four long stoppages between Brussels and Antwerp, a distance of thirty miles. The longest is at Mech lin, from whence all the railways branch. They are managed by the government, and said to be by no means so lucrative as when they were in the hands of the commercial and contracting parties. I was told that now they hardly pay their ex pences, whereas before the profits were immense. The old tower at Mechlin is very picturesque, though still unfinished. There are many fine pic tures in the church, but we could not remain long enough to see them. To me there is a great charm in Brussels, owing"], [27, "9 BRUSSELS. to its cleanliness, brightness, and gaiety, and the clear atmosphere and blue sky. The smart shops, wide streets, and regular buildings, always remind me of Paris, without its drawbacks of noise and confusion. When here four years ago we visited the Prince of Orange's palace, and explored all the curiosities of the place, but our stay this time was productive of little incident. I went over the lace-shops, and could not resist making some pur chases. The cookery of the hotel was so bad, that we had recourse to a restaurateur, where we how ever fared no better. The little carriages or flys, called \" vigilantes,\" are particularly convenient. After spending nearly a week at Brussels, we left it on Monday, the 31st, by the early train, which goes first to Mechlin, and thence by Tirle mont to Ans, a little distance from Liege. Here we were obliged to scramble into omnibuses of the worst description, that threatened dislocation to the bones and distraction to the head, as we jum bled on to the best inn (the Pavilion Anglais.) The railway travelling has the undoubted advantage of enabling one to move from place to place with"], [28, "TRAVELLING COMPANIONS. 10 great rapidity, but its inconveniences are innume rable ; such as the noise, the smell, the jar, and, above all, the being brought into contact with all kinds and conditions of people. On this occasion there was a large assemblage of priests, and a lady of not very refined appearance, who confided to me a plaintive story of her being too late for one train, and missing another, wliile she was drinking a glass of eau sucree, and finally declared that she had found herself at Brussels, meaning to be at Liege, without her sac de nuit, which she assured me contained 1500 francs. A picturesque-looking man, in a green costume, and Louis Quatorze boots, whose appearance was half Spanish brigand, half player, also accompanied us. On getting into the omnibus, the lady, with great glee, informed me, \" J'ai tout retrouve, jusqu'a mon ombrelle.\" We dined at Liege, and posted on to Aix-la- Chapelle, where we arrived late, having passed the Prussian frontier. The Custom-House officers were civil, and did not unpack or meddle with any thing we had except a ham, on which they enforced duty."], [29, "11 COLOGNE. The railroad is to be continued to Cologne, much to the convenience of travellers. We remained but one night at Aix, which was full of people. I tried one of the baths, but cannot say I liked the experiment. Napoleon's famous bath no longer exists. On arriving at Cologne, after a hot dusty drive, we immediately visited the cathedral, which has never been finished. There are numerous strange legends respecting this pile, one of which is, that the devil furnished the plan ; but in consequence of the architect having failed in his part of the compact, his satanic majesty destroyed the design, and nobody else has been able to complete it. The King of Prussia sent lately to have an estimate of the expense of finishing it, and the valuation amounted to four millions of thalers \u2014 about a million sterling. It is a fine specimen of Gothic architecture, and contains many objects of inte rest, amonff which is the shrine of the three kincfs of Cologne. The heart of Marie de Medicis is said to be buried within the walls of this church. The painted glass is beautiful."], [30, "12 STEAMING UP THE RHINE. We were next day picked up by the steamer, which brought the rest of our family from Rotter dam. These boats are long, narrow, and adapted to carry a great number of passengers. There were two hundred on this occasion ; but, as we oc cupied the pavilion, which is really a good-sized private room, we were well accommodated, en joyed plenty of air and light, and were not mo lested by strangers. The steamer was to have sailed at six, but of that we were not aware, and were, consequently, left behind. In fact, the vessel had left the place of embarkation, but, on seeing us arrive, the captain very civilly put back. We passed Bonn and Drachenfels, both of which disappointed me, and at four o'clock we arrived at Coblentz, which is finely situated. A picturesque bridge of boats connects it with the citadel of Ehrenbreitstein, bristling with its embrasures and lines of artillery, on the opposite side of the river. There are several fine large inns at Coblentz, looking towards the quay. We had good rooms at the Hotel du Geant, where we were to pass the night, the steamer remaining till seven o'clock the"], [31, "13 COBLENTZ. next morning. We took a walk in the evening, and, discovering an excellent bookseller's shop, purchased some books, and then crossed the bridge of boats. The effect of the scenery at night was very striking; \" the wide and winding Rhine,\" smooth as a mirror, gave back the thousand lights from the old Gothic windows and gable ends of the numerous edifices. The weather was worthy of a southern clime, not a breath of wind, not a vestige of damp ; and a clear full moon completed the charm of this lovely scene. Next morning, September 4th, we continued our progress. After Coblentz, the scenery becomes much more grand. We passed some old castles, and many picturesque crags and hills, feathered down to the water's edge with rich and luxuriant foliage. The prettiest seemed to be one belonging to Prince Frederic of Prussia. This castle has been repaired and rendered habitable, and must be in summer a delightful residence. It is situated halfway up a rocky hill, perched like an eagle's nest in a romantic situation, and commands no doubt a magnificent view."], [32, "14 MAYENCE. We landed at four o'clock at Mayence, which appeared a dismal old fortified town ; and, after getting our letters, we crossed the bridge of boats, which is here thrown over the Rhine, and found ourselves at the railway-office. Here, as usual, there seemed much confusion, and we discovered, when too late, that our carriages ought to have been landed at Biberach, and that they must now post to Wiesbaden. After waiting an hour in the travellers' room, almost suffocated by thick smoke from the persevering Germans' cigars, and after nearly taking the wrong train (which would have deposited us at Frankfort,), we were conveyed, during a tremendous thunderstorm and torrents of rain, to Wiesbaden, where we determined to rest a few days, and found tolerable rooms at the Hotel de la Rose. This town is larger than I expected, and remark ably clean and well built. It was very full, but we found no one of our acquaintance.

At six o'clock in the morning* the band begins to play, and all the people flock to the well, where they receive as many glasses of this nearly boiling water as they may think fit to swallow, walking ten minutes between each ; they then hurry to the baths, where they remain twenty minutes, and after their breakfast the day is spent in walking, loung ing-, and idling1 about. The walks at Wiesbaden are pretty, and there is a fine square, built of white stone, with a large room for play and reunion, and a range of shops on each side, under a colonnade. The shops appeared all of an inferior description, like stalls at a fair. The effect of the Bohemian glass is, however, very beautiful : the variety of shapes and hues gives the appearance of a garden of tulips. We made an excursion to Biberach, the summer palace of the Duke of Nassau, who has lately suc ceeded his father. The gardens are laid out in the"], [34, "16 EXCURSION TO BIBERACH. English style, and consist of three hundred acres ; the castle looks upon the Rhine, and has a fine broad Italian terrace, covered with magnificent orange trees. The views up and down the Rhine from hence are enchanting, and here we bid fare well to that noble river. The interior of the palace is in no way striking. The principal features are two galleries in white and gold, one on each side of a round room, with a dome supported by marble columns. We were shown the private apartments, and some vases which had been pre sented to the late Duke, by Napoleon and the Emperor Nicholas. Sunday 7- \u2014 We attended divine service in the fine old Lutheran chapel ; all the resident English were there, but I did not recognise any one. The weather had entirely changed since the thunder storm, and now became so cold that we almost longed for fires. On Wednesday 10th, we took our leave of Wies baden, and our britschka having been ingeniously converted into a carriage which would give us four inside places and the same number outside,"], [35, "17 FRANKFORT. the junior branches of the family were packed therein. The method of arranging* these little open carriages in Germany so that they may close for four persons when necessary, has great merit. It does not require above ten minutes to effect the metamorphosis. Having no travelling waggon or fourgon, our beds, canteens, and every thing not previously sent on by diligence, were packed on the carriages, and our great coach was tolerably well loaded. We passed through the fine free town of Frank fort, but having spent a week there four years ago, we did not delay above half an hour, while I drove to the brilliant and spacious shop of Monsieur Stiegewald, glittering with Bohemian glass of every form and hue. Frankfort is finely situated on the Maine ; it is built of white stone, has wide streets and good hotels. We crossed the bridge, and proceeded to As chaffenburg, where we were to pass the night. The approach to it is romantic ; a fine old red brick castle, with towers and turrets, stands on a height. We set out at nine o'clock the fol- c"], [36, "18 GERMAN POSTING AND POSTBOYS. lowing morning, and passed a large forest and some pretty scenery. Nothing can be more weari some than the German posting. The sluggishness and sang froid of the people, the delays, the hilly roads, the extreme slowness, and the impossibility of obtaining the smallest attention to your remon strances, beyond a puff of smoke in your face, are a continued trial of patience. The Bavarian post boys are dressed in light blue, with white feathers, and a horn, on which they sometimes play a pretty waltz, but more frequently only produce a cracked and disagreeable sound. A great deal of fuss is made about the passports, which are taken from you, and pored and mumbled over, in every town. Wiirzburg is a venerable old city, looking dull and deserted, but possessing great remains of its former splendour when under ecclesiastic rule. An ancient bridge, with colossal statues, is first passed. We spent the night at an hotel, which we found dear and dirty, and the eating beyond all description bad. Having discovered that the waiter and the master of the inn understood French, I derived considerable comfort from in-"], [37, "19 WURZBURG. forming them that we had meant to stay the next day, but finding every thing so bad, we should go on. Next morning we went to see the old palace, which is of great extent, and from its magnificence in gilding, marbles, &c, is called the German Ver sailles, nor is it wholly unworthy of the name. The chapel, into which we were first shown, is not very much inferior to the French one. The stair case is large, and particularly easy of ascent. There are various suites of apartments belonging to the king, the queen, the crown prince, and the queen mother. The rooms of the latter are filled with pictures of her numerous family, but there is nothing remarkable beyond the length of the vista, and the number of apartments, except an old chamber entirely composed of painted glass ; even the ceiling and shutters are of the brightest co lours, and the whole has a singular and pleasing effect, being like the finest enamel. We went to see the old cathedral, which is spacious and handsome, and was once richly gilt. After a hurried visit to a curiosity-shop, where china, glass, cabinets, old silver, and plate were c 2"], [38, "20 WURZBURG. displayed, we recommenced our journey. The dis tance from Wiirzburg to Nuremburg may be ac complished in twelve hours, but we determined to divide this, and sleep at Langenfeldt, a small dirty inn, where, nineteen years before, returning from Vienna, we bought and carried off all their china, of which they knew not the beauty, but which turned out to be the finest old Dresden, and once the property of the Margrave of Anspach. The landlord remembered us all, but was surprised when shown Seaham, as the baby then three months old. On arriving at Nuremburg the following day, after passing through a country where hop-gardens replaced the vineyard, we found the whole place in the greatest possible state of commotion and re joicing. The king held his court there, and the reviews were just over ; there had been 20,000 men. Many foreigners of distinction were still there, and several balls and concerts had been lately given. Every house was decorated with blue and white festoons, every window wreathed with garlands, and triumphal arches had been erected, flags were flying, and in short the city was"], [39, "ROYAL FORGETFULNESS. 21 one scene of gaiety. We found rooms prepared for us at the Hotel de Baviere, and here we deter mined to remain a few days. Lord L. wrote to the aide-de-camp in waiting, explaining our ignorance of the king's being at Nuremburg, our intention of proceeding to Miinich to pay our court, and also that Lord L.'s uniform had been sent on with the baggage, but that he trusted he would be allowed the gratification of an audience of his majesty. To this we received a cold and flat refusal, rendered the more ungracious and unkind, in Lord L.'s opinion, from the former inti macy that subsisted between the king, when crown prince, and Lord L., and the late Lord Castlereagh, at Vienna, during the Congress in 1814. We found Lord Combermere, who had met with a similar refusal. Prince Ernest of Saxe Coburg came to visit us. He had performed our last year's tour round Spain, had been to Lisbon and Tangiers, and expressed himself delighted with all he had seen. He was going off immediately to the camp near Manheim, where there were to be reviews of the German con-"], [40, "22 NUREMBURG. federation troops, consisting of about 60,000 men, commanded by the King of Wurttemberg. The weather being very wet during our stay at Nuremburg, we were unable to go out. The town of Fiirth, close to it, has lately sprung up, and is principally peopled with Jews. A railroad con nects it with Nuremburg, and a distance of four miles is accomplished in a quarter of an hour ; for even the railways in Germany partake of the na tional slowness. The canal that is to connect the Danube and the Rhine, and fulfill the great scheme of Charlemagne and the favourite project of Napo leon, will pass through this city. It is an immense work, and will cost twelve hundred thousand florins. It appears to be carried on in a noble manner, being formed with the finest and whitest stone. We were told it had been undertaken by the king, who was very eager about it, but that commercial men had no opinion of the speculation, and that the shares had fallen thirty per cent., from the idea that there never could be sufficient traffic to repay such an immense outlay. We were unwilling to leave Nuremburg without"], [41, "NUREMBURG. 23 seeing Fiirth ; we accordingly set out by the rail way, which runs close by the roadside, and appears to be placed there for the purpose of frightening all the horses that pass near it. I must not omit to record the singular fact that, as there is but one steam-engine, which is always going backwards and forwards, the alternate trips are performed by two miserable horses. Having missed the right train, by delaying too long at Mr. Pickert's, an old Jew, with all the commercial dexterity and acuteness of his tribe, who has an immense collec tion of antiques and curiosities of all sorts and de scriptions, we returned with the horses, and were half an hour on the road. We were informed that there is not a single English resident in all Nuremburg. It is a dull old town. We went over the exhibition, where in several rooms are displayed the various manufactures of the place. The furniture was the best, and rather in the French style ; but, in general, the things struck me as clumsy and uncouth. We also visited Bestel Meyer's, a sort of bazaar, where I was much struck with the beauty of the toys, every"], [42, "24 RATISBON. thing being executed in miniature, in gold and silver. Wednesday 16. \u2014 We left Nuremburg. The dis tance to Ratisbon, thirteen and a half German miles, or sixty-five English, was divided into two days, as the roads were hilly, the carriages heavy, and the posting indescribably slow and tedious. We slept at a clean new inn at Neumarkt, and pro ceeded next morning to Ratisbon. The scenery was wild, and we passed through a great extent of forest. There is a stone bridge at Ratisbon, the only one ou the whole course of the Danube down to the Black Sea. The inn at Ratisbon was noisy and dirty, though the best in the place ; but, as we only intended to stay one day, this was of little consequence. We determined to make the most of our time ; and, set ting out early, in a dirty fiacre, drove to Monsieur Kock's curiosity-shop. We found temptation only in some silver clasps for books, and, after making choice of a few, and offering nearly half what he demanded, we left him to reflect upon the matter, and pursued our drive. The Rathhaus, or Town"], [43, "THE WALHALLA. 25 Hall, has no merit in point of beauty, but is of great antiquity ; the barbarous and ancient me thods of torture are to be seen, but we declined the pressing invitation of our guide to visit them. Ratisbon is a curious old town, but melancholy and deserted ; the cathedral is a fine specimen of an cient Gothic architecture ; some of the windows are of old painted glass, but those put in by the present king nearly equal them in richness of colour. We drove to the Walhalla, which occupied about half an hour, through an ugly flat country. This fine Grecian temple is built on an eminence looking over the Danube, and has a very extensive and magnificent view. It was commenced in 1830, and is to be finished in 1842. The conception is grand, and too much praise cannot be bestowed on the King of Bavaria, for the liberality and public spirit with which it has been executed, with reve nues that otherwise he might have appropriated to himself. The proportions I regretted I could not obtain, but they are colossal.

Three stone terraces and a flight of steps lead down to the river. At the adjoining village is the summer residence of Prince Tour and Taxis. The gardens are on the Danube, and the stables and riding-school seemed well arranged ; but being pressed for time, we did not delay, but returned to Ratisbon. Here is the town palace of the same prince, who is said to pos sess immense wealth. It is yet in an unfinished state, and numbers of workmen are employed about it. Some Gothic passages and a small pri vate chapel have been completed, and are in good taste. The painted windows in the latter, though modern, are exquisitely finished, and a fine statue of Christ is here, in Carrara marble, by Dannecker. We saw a collection of modern pictures, and on returning home we found Monsieur Kock, who had decided on accepting our offer for the silver book clasps."], [45, "STEAMING ON THE DANUBE. 27 The journey from Ratisbon to Vienna being nearly sixty posts, and tedious and uninteresting, we determined to avail ourselves of the steamers down the Danube, which mode of travelling re duces the whole to a voyage of two days. The only drawback is the necessity of rising early, the vessel starting before five o'clock in the morning. On account of the difficulty of the navigation of the Danube, the boats are very long and narrow. Those to Lintz, which is the first day's halt, belong to a Bavarian company, and are certainly inferior to the Austrian. We passed the Walhalla, which, when the wooden shed in which it is now encased is re moved, will be a commanding object from the Danube. The scenery is in my opinion much more striking than the dressed and cultivated banks of the Rhine; the steep hills, the dark pine-forests, the high crags, are all bolder; nor are ruins and old castles wanting to complete the picturesque effect, while antique legends and traditions add to the in terest. We reached Lintz at seven o'clock in the even-"], [46, "28 LINTZ ing, and with great difficulty got some extremely bad garrets, at the inn called \"The White Goose,\" for which I was told we paid nearly double what we had previously given for good apartments. The carriage and baggage were removed to the Austrian steamer, and next morning at six, we went on board, in a most violent deluge of rain. The vessel was much larger than that of the pre ceding day, but we found it a scene of bustle and confusion, as several carriages, and between two and three hundred people of all nations, required accommodation. I was quite comfortable in a deck-cabin, with plenty of air and light, from whence I could gaze on the scenery, and, unseen, observe our fellow-pas sengers. A Tyrolese party, in their national dress, attracted attention ; their carriage was peculiar, and we were told that the head of the family was a chief in his own land. Turks, Germans, and a motley crew, completed the party. We made acquaintance with the Belgian mi nister, who was going to Vienna, and found him a gentlemanlike young man. The rain continued with-"], [47, "29 ARRIVAL AT VIENNA. out intermission the whole day. The scenery was much the same as yesterday, and the river, rushing like an angry torrent, bore us on rapidly. We passed Mblk, and admired its old Benedictine convent, which is of great size, and situated on a height overhanging the river. It is a noble object, and must command a magnificent view. At about four o'clock we reached Neusdorf, and the passengers rushed to the landing, to meet their expecting friends in the crowd assembled on shore. Prince Esterhazy had most kindly sent his in tendant and his carriage, to take us to the Swan Inn in Vienna, where we were to reside until his country-house at Maria-Hiilf, at a short distance from the town, could be prepared for our recep tion. We were driven by the coachman who had served us when we were last in Vienna, in 1823. The hotel was noisy, and, though the cookery was good, we had in no other respect reason to be pleased with our abode.

We asked permission to see our old house, now the residence of the French ambassador, and we walked through all the rooms, so interesting to us from former recollections. It is still one of the best houses in Vienna.

Wednesday 23. \u2014 We were at a great dinner at Monsieur Tatischeff, the Russian ambassador's. He has the spacious hotel belonging to Prince Louis Lichtenstein. The dinner was very magnificent, and I was afterwards shown the armoury, and an immense collection of bijouterie and vieilleries. We met Madame Narishkin, Count Woronzoff, Prince and Princess Kourakin, Countess Razo moffsky, and many whose names I did not know. After the dinner we drove to Prince Metternich's garden, where there was a \"reception,\" he and the"], [53, "PRINCE METTERNICH. 35 princess having just returned from their chateau at Konigswarth in Bohemia. I own I was curious to see once more this extraordinary man, who has so long exercised such an influence over European politics, and whose power here seems supreme. Eighteen years ago, I thought him old, but very agreeable ; he was then married to an amiable invalid, of his own age, and had four daughters and one son. Within short intervals he lost all but two daugh ters, one of whom is now married to Count Shan dor, a great Hungarian noble, who was in England, and for some time at Melton. The loss of his only son Victor was a severe blow ; and when his second daughter Clementine, a beautiful girl, who was painted by Lawrence as Hebe, faded aAvay, his af fliction was extreme. He was, however, in time consoled by a charming young wife, who was rather looked down on by the proud noblesse of Vienna, on account of her Jewish origin. Gentle and lovely, she lived but a year, and died, leaving one child, a boy. Soon afterwards, the prince again found comfort in a third choice, Countess Melanie Zichy, the present princess. She is an d 2"], [54, "36 PRINCE METTERNICII. agreeable, handsome woman, and has now three children, the eldest about eight years old. I found the prince's manner unchanged ; the same peculiar calmness still distinguished him. His form is yet erect, but his eye less brilliant ; the face had lengthened, the hair was silvered; in short, time had been at work. The expression, the mind were there, but the fire was abated. He embraced Lord L., and kissed my hand. \" Enchante de vous revoir, miladi, apres vingt J> ans. \" Eighteen,\" I replied. \" Ah, ce n'etait pas la peine de me corriger pour si peu de chose.\" In answer to our observation that he was not grown old, he observed, \" Non, on ne change pas, on ne vieillit plus, et je vais vous prouver cela.

We drove to Prince Metternich's garden, a lovely residence in the town, with all the quiet and charm of the country. The building is large, and has been augmented at different times, and as the prince said, \" Mes gens ont une maison, mes enfans ont la leur, et ma femme et moi nous sommes seuls dans celle-ci.\" There was a profusion of flowers, and the beds were laid out in the English fashion. The recep tion-rooms are charming, and being only divided by large sheets of plate-glass, the whole is visible at once ; the decorations are beautiful, and in the best possible taste.

I sat between Prince Metternich (who led me into dinner) and Prince Jablonowski, a former acquaintance. Some conversation arose respecting Pasta and David, then at Vienna ; and as to good masters, Prince Metternich observed, \" Selon moi, c'est comme la recette pour saire la soupe au lievre ; preinierenient il faut attraper votre lievre ; done premierement, pour chanter, il faut une belle voix.\" Talking of Cerito, he asked me what success she had in London.

In four years she had filled five large books with the portraits of all the sovereigns, ministers, heroes, and great men, or public characters, of different countries, of the day. As Prince Metternich said,"], [60, "42 THE PRATER. \" Cela a commence par les connaissances du sa lon, et puis cela s'est generalise.\" The pictures are well painted, and strikingly like ; they are mostly done in Vienna, by an artist named Daffinger ; some, however, have been sent out from other countries. This collection will become invaluable in time, as it is unique, for few are in the situation to have the opportunity and power of obtaining these pictures, even if they had the courage or the will to lay such a tax on their friends and acquaintances, by making a request, or rather giving a command, that cannot be disputed. I was surprised to find the lovely Prater aban doned and deserted. No capital possesses so fine a park ; none can boast of a wild forest in the heart of a great city ; but because it is not the fashion, no one goes there.

They now flock to Hitzing and Schbnbrunn, a short way from the town ; and in the evening Strauss's band generally plays there, or in the Volksgarten. With all their apathy and slowness, the Ger mans are a very gay, junketing nation, always dressing, dancing, and seeking amusement, and, as a Russian lady said to me, \" C'est le pays des chapeaux ; jusqu'a. la cuisi niere on les a couverts de fleurs.\" This passion for dress in the women adds to the brightness of the scene. The inconvenience of walking in Vienna is great, because in the streets, all are confounded together, there are no trottoirs, and the carriages frequently drive close to the houses, without any warning or apology, beyond a prolonged and mournful \" Oh !\" \u2014 something between a howl and a scream. Saturday, Oct. 3. \u2014 We started for Pottendorf,"], [62, "44 FORCHENSTEIN. on a visit to Prince Esterhazy. This residence is about thirty miles from Vienna, and prettily si tuated. The grounds are laid out a VAnglaise, and a piece of water runs through them. A pro fusion of flowers decorate the balustrades and the various little bridges ; the house is old, but has been altered and made very comfortable by the present possessor. It is not very large, only containing about six good lodging-rooms besides the suite we occupied. The party was small ; Princess Leo poldine Lichtenstein, sister to Prince Esterhazy, Prince Nicholas his son, Count Szcheny, and our selves, sat down to dinner at six o'clock. Next morning, at nine o'clock, we set out in an open carriage and four, followed by a chariot in case of bad weather, to Forchenstein, a curious old fortress belonging to the prince, about twenty seven miles off. A little river near Pottendorf divides Austria from Hungary. We passed through several villages, that were clean and whitewashed. The houses are placed rather distant from each other, on account of the frequent fires, and the"], [63, "FORCHENSTEIN. 45 streets are wide. The appearance of the pea santry was creditable \u2014 all comfortably and well clothed, and their manner respectful. Our road lay through a wild steppe, or plain, only inhabited by shepherds tending their flocks. A large portion of the prince's income is derived from the produce of the wool, which, as he said, is like the coals to us coal-owners. He has bought all the adjoining posts and post-horses, and carries on the traffic as the government does. We found our relays in readiness every where, and really the Hungarian driving was so rapid as to be more in the Russian than the Austrian style. We had already changed horses once, when, on arriving at the foot of the mountain, on the top of which the castle stands, we were met by the people of the village, when small strong horses, belonging to the peasantry, were attached to our carriage, and we commenced the winding ascent. Formerly the steep passage up was performed by oxen, but stout ponies are now considered as equally effective. The rocky heights, the background of the"], [64, "46 FORCHENSTEIN. mountains, and the forests of chestnut trees, are all very picturesque. As we passed onward, cannons were fired from the old fortress, the echoes repeated the sound, and the effect was like thunder. A military guard saluted us, and we entered this fine old chateau, which, though in perfect preservation, is not habitable. The view from the windows was enchanting ; the walls were covered with unframed portraits of all the ancestors of the family. After walking through the rooms, and examin ing the pictures (including one, where as some one observed, \" L'arbre genealogique de la famille Esterhazy sortait de l'estomac d'Adam \"), we de scended to some vaults, in one of which are pre served the papers, parchments, swords, horse trappings, &c, taken from the Turks in various wars.

Among other things I was particularly struck with two large mirrors, in solid frames of old embossed silver. There are besides, medals, coins, strings of old rings, &c. : in short, no description can convey an adequate impression of the variety and richness of this collection. After viewing the chateau, we partook of an excellent luncheon, and returned to Pottendorf. Next morning, Monday, was very unpropitious for our projected expedition to Esterhaz. The rain came down in torrents ; and the princess, having suffered all night from spasms, was too ill to move. The prince, however, insisted on our going, as all the preparations had been made, and the people were in readiness to receive us. He there fore set out en caleche, accompanied by his secre tary, and Lord L. and I followed in a small chariot. After four or five hours' shaking, we arrived about two o'clock at Esterhaz, an old palace or"], [66, "48 ESTERHAZ. chateau, in the Louis XIV. style. The great grand father of the prince had been ambassador at Paris during the reign of that monarch, and on his return he determined to build this luxurious and magnificent abode, and make himself independ ent of Vienna. The woods and alleys are very beautiful, but the situation is low and damp, and, I should fear, unwholesome. A great lake is on one side, and the Raab and Danube flow on the other. The prince's secretary told me that 200,000 acres of the estate required to be drained ; and that 50,000 were about to be thus improved. The building is of vast size ; and has a great facade, offices, stables, an orangery, and a theatre, where the founder, a singular old man, used to have an Italian opera, Haydn leading the orchestra. Having his own private society, he never invited any one ; but the more company came, and the longer they stayed, the better he was pleased. They were lodged and served, and carriages placed at their orders, to drive about in the day, and go to the theatre at night. In order to fill the latter, the peasants were made to attend, instead of being required to work."], [67, "ESTERHAZ. 49 An exterior flight of steps leads to the first or principal floor, where are two large and lofty saloons, beautifully painted and magnificently gilt, in the most perfect taste of the age in which the chateau was built. On one side are five or six rooms, which used to be inhabited by Marie Therese whenever she paid a visit here, and on the other side a similar apartment for the Emperor Joseph. The gilding, the carving, the paintings, the ornaments, and the old chairs and sofas, are all in the style that is now so much copied, and so universally admired. The parquets are all fine. The silk is worn and faded, but very little would make the house habitable and extremely enjoyable. Below is a curious old hall, where fountains played, and on each side are the apartments of the prince and princess. These rooms, with windows down to the ground, open into an old French garden, and in fine weather must be delightful. They are panelled en vieux laque, richly gilt, and fitted up with pea-green silk, embroidered in gold. I never heard such musical clocks as were placed in every room ; and in the prince's apartment is E"], [68, "50 SIEGENDORF. one with a canary, that sung every night, and this was the usual signal for his highness to go to the theatre. The accommodation for strangers is abundant, and the rooms are really very comfortable ; the whole is in perfect taste, and might easily be made a charming abode. In an old garde meuble are some curious things, and a great quantity of the finest old Dresden porcelain. I remained by the drawing-room fire while the prince showed Lord L. his large stud of horses. Monsieur Mayer, the secretary, meanwhile related to me a marvellous but true story of a wild boy having been found in the woods here. He could not speak, was per fectly savage, and ate raw fish. They kept him a year, and tried every means to tame him, but all in vain. He tore off the clothes that were put on him, refused to taste boiled meat, and finally escaped by jumping into the lake, and was never heard of afterwards. At four o'clock we left Esterhaz, and set out for Siegendorf, the residence of Count Stephan Szcheny, a Hungarian noble. It was arranged that"], [69, "SIEGENDORF. 51 we should dine here. We had formerly known him intimately, and he had been several times in England, having quite an Anglomania. He used to vow that nothing should ever induce him to marry ; but seven years ago he broke his resolu tion, and was united to a Countess Zichy, to whom he had been long attached. She had five children of her own, and some of her husband's by a former wife, and as they have now two little ones with beautiful eyes, there is a large family party. The count has built an odd but comfortable house, very much in the English fashion, and fitted it up with various chintzes. The great dining-room was lighted as for a ball ; the sideboards were covered with cups, &c, won at the Presburg, Pesth, and Vienna races. There was a great deal of heart and good feeling in the count's manner and reception, and it was evident that extraordinary efforts had been made to arrange every thing for our gratification. I rejoiced, therefore, that the rain had not prevented our day's expedition. I found the count as amusing and agreeable as ever. E 2"], [70, "52 EISENSTADT. We took our leave soon after dinner, and went on to Eisenstadt, where we arrived at about ten o'clock, very tired, and went to bed. This splen did possession is certainly the principal seat, and ought to be the principal residence, of Prince Esterhazy. The house is of immense size ; the gardens, drives, pleasure-grounds, stables, chasse, &c, are all centred here, and are in the most princely style. This spacious pile of buildings is capable of containing four hundred visiters, and we were shewn a baronial hall where six hundred had dined. A little carriage waited to take us over the grounds. The gardens are of great extent, and close to the house. The hothouse range is between six and seven hundred feet long ; three hundred and eighty large and healthy orange-trees had just been taken in, and, to give an idea of the profusion of plants, in one house there were two hundred and fifty different heaths. The gardener was a German, and spoke a little English ; and, after he had shewn us all his department, to my amazement, he mounted a long-tailed, prancing"], [71, "STATUE BY CANOVA. 53 black charger, and guided us through the grounds. Here and there we admired the beautiful views of Forchenstein and Esterhaz in the distance, surrounded by extensive vineyards. The Marie temple is in the grounds, situated on a com manding eminence ; but the Leopoldine temple near the house is more interesting, as it con tains an admirable statue of the Princess Leo poldine, executed by Canova, when she was only eighteen. It is graceful and lovely, though unfortunately there are some blemishes in the marble. Shortly after our return to Vienna, I went one evening to a small party at Princess Metternich's, to hear Thalberg play. The ladies formed a circle round him, and the men stood in a group by them selves. The piano was placed in the middle of the room ; and, after the performer, who seemed a gentlemanlike, shy young man, had been presented to me, the music began. He played three pieces; the last and most admired was the prayer in Rossini's \" Mose in Egitto,\" with extremely diffi cult variations. Prince Metternich said he pre-"], [72, "54 TIIALBERG'S PLAYING. ferred Thalberg to Lizst, though the latter did things that were more astounding. \" II fait,\" said the prince, \" des impossibilites, et il est romanesque ; tandis que Thalberg est tou jours classique.\" The princess's dress was singular, but very pretty. Her gown was black, and a Turkish shawl of black and gold was folded round her; on her neck immense emerald drops fell from a slender line of diamonds, and a flat Persian cap of gold and embroidery lay on one side of her head, while an enormous tassel of floss silk that hung from it served her as a plaything during the evening."], [73, "CHAPTER III.

CHAPTER III. As the time drew near for our departure from Vienna, I became very sad. We had spent nearly a month there, and had been treated with the greatest kindness ; and, although there was nei ther gaiety, grandeur, nor excitement, there was an absence of all worry and constraint; and we enjoyed so agreeable an existence, that, but for the remembrance that kind friends expected us elsewhere, I think our journey to Constantinople would have been given up, or at least delayed till the spring. Our fate, however, was sealed, the die cast, and the break-up of the party commenced by our son Seaham's going off, en courrier, to England, with a messenger who arrived suddenly from Constantinople on the 13th, and was again"], [76, "58 EMBARK ON THE DANUBE. despatched on the night of the 14th. The remain ing children moved to the apartments we had taken for them at the \" Stadt London,\" a clean, quiet inn near the ramparts ; and next day, at two o'clock, we embarked on board the Galatea, a small steamer that had arrived in consequence of the Danube being too low to admit of the regular one making the voyage. The place of embarkation is a pretty wild spot at the end of the Prater. Owing to the change of the boat, the company sent our carriage by land \u2014 rather an inconvenient arrangement, and a bad beginning for our expedition. The vessel was long and narrow. On each side we found a small deck-cabin arranged to receive us ; below was a ladies' cabin and a good saloon. The captain, an Italian, spoke all languages, German, French, English, &c. ; he was tall and handsome, and an extremely agreeable, gentlemanlike, well-informed man. The only persons of our acquaintance on board were Mr. Napier, a young Englishman, and Emir Pacha, a Turk, who was returning to his own"], [77, "BANKS OF THE DANUBE. 59 country, after spending five years in England, and some time at Cambridge. He was presented to us by the Turkish minister, who bade him farewell in the most affectionate manner, taking his head between his hands as one would a child's, and kissing both sides of his face. There was also Baron Taubenheim, a Wurttemberg officer, going to Syria to buy horses for his sovereign ; an Austrian colonel ; a Turkish doctor, who spoke all lan guages ; an old Countess de Maltzahn, mother to Countess Kbnigsmarck, the wife of the Prussian minister at Constantinople ; and many others whom I knew not even by name. Among the motley crowd was a French milliner, carrying Paris fashions to the east, and a Vienna lady going to marry the Austrian consul at Galatz. The weather was most unpropitious, and tor rents of rain fell unceasingly. The banks of the Danube were for the most part flat and desolate. We passed a picturesque ruin on a height, and arrived about five o'clock at Presburg, where there is a bridge of boats, and an old square castle on a hill. All the passengers hastened on shore, leaving"], [78, "60 PRESBURG. us in quiet possession of the vessel, for we declined landing, although we were told that there was an opera, \" La Sonnambula,\" and a great fete going on. Our dinner was rather a scramble, and we soon after retired to rest. My berth was so high I had some difficulty in getting in, and when there, in avoiding breaking my head. At five o'clock next morning, guns were fired to summon the passengers on board, and we once more got under weigh ; and at about ten o'clock we ar rived at the station where the carriage waited, and the captain had it immediately shipped, when, to our surprise and indignation, we found the locks had been broken and the things examined. This appeared to us a most unjustifiable act, and pecu liarly so, from the circumstance that it was in no way our fault that the carriage was sent by land, as it would have been more convenient to have had it with us, in which case there would have been no attempt to examine any thing. The day was even worse than the preceding, and we were annoyed with an unceasing deluge. We dined at six o'clock, and arrived at Pesth about"], [79, "PESTH. 61 seven. On landing we were conducted to a large, clean inn, called the Queen of England. The rooms were good, but I never was in a more noisy place. Here we remained a day. Pesth, the capital of Hungary, is a large old town on one side of the Danube ; Buda or Ofen being situated on the other. The latter has rather a desolate aspect; a large old castle stands on a height, and there is a background of mountains. A sus pension-bridge is constructing between the two cities, the engineer being the same who built the one at Hammersmith. This, when finished, will be of indescribable advantage, for at present the only means of communication for the people is by boats. The streets of Pesth are large and wide, but un paved; this evil, however, seems in some places in the act of being remedied : indeed Pesth appears altogether to be an improving city. I observed many large houses building. The steam-navigation of the Danube has greatly increased the commerce, by affording the inhabitants means of exporting their corn, wines, and other merchandize. The costume of the Hungarian peasantry is sin-"], [80, "62 HUNGARIAN PEASANTRY. gular. The long hair, large flap hat, and the fold ing pelisse lined with sheepskin, strongly reminded me of Russia, and the little horses are harnessed abreast, as in that country. One long line of shops appears to be their Bond Street ; and here, as in Vienna, the signs are very appropriate, and taste fully painted. A watchmaker had decorated his shop by a large figure of Time, with an hour-glass. Near windows filled with velvet caps, embroidered in gold, hangs a full-length picture of a smart hus sar, his charger richly caparisoned. A milliner is distinguished by a brilliant picture of the Em press, or some archduchess, in full dress. These signs, which are particularly Avell painted, and very superior to any I ever saw elseAA'here, give gaiety and splendour to the scene. The day Avas clear and fine, but the cold was so intense that I was soon obliged to come in-doors. I regretted not seeing the opposite city, but our stay being so short, it was impossible. The Hungarians are ATery proud of their Casino, or reading-rooms, which have been lately built on the plan, as they say, of an English club."], [81, "63 MOIIACZ. Sunday, the 18th, at six o'clock in the morning, Ave left Pesth, and embarked in the -Zryny steamer, of eighty-horse poAver, so called after the famous Austrian general who fought against the Turks. The captain, an Italian, gave me up his cabin, a small one on deck, and I went to bed for some hours. The continual trembling and shaking of the vessel prevent the possibility of writing, and the whole existence on board a steamer is so weari- some and monotonous, that it creates a listless feel ing of unwillingness to exert oneself. The AATeather Avas fine, and we discussed the pro ject of leaving the boat at Rustschuk, and travel ling by land to Constantinople, passing through Schumla and Adrianople. Some said it was feasible on horseback, as the couriers took that route, and the distance was not above three hundred miles ; but all agreed that for a lady to cross the Balkan in a carriage would be difficult, if not impossible. The days being short, and there being no moon, we were obliged to anchor for that night at Mohacs ; and next morning, Monday, a heavy fall of rain be gan, and continued all day. We started on Tues-"], [82, "64 SEMLIN. day with the earliest dawn, but the thick mists and adverse winds delayed us greatly. We met the packet coming from Constantinople, and stop ped ; the two vessels remaining about half an hour alongside for the interchange of letters, merchan dize, &c. This was the only event of a long, dreary, cold, wet day, until Ave anchored at Neusatz, a Avretched place, Avhere no one was even inclined to go ashore. The objections to the deck-cabins, which coun terbalance their merits of light and air, are their extreme cold, and the impossibility of keeping them dry. The AA-et poured in from the deck, and, though tarpaulins were nailed over the top, yet, despite every effort, the cold Avas intense and the damp extreme. Next day, Wednesday, at about tAvelve o'clock, we arrived at Semlin, and remained two hours while the passports were vises. This town is on the Austrian side of the frontier, and opposite to Belgrade, a Turkish fortress. Shortly after we had left the tOAvn, which still remained in sight, we unfortunately ran upon a sandbank, and were"], [83, "DRENCOVA. 65 delayed there for tAvo hours, and no sooner was the vessel got off than Ave floundered on another, and much time Avas lost before the steamer was fairly in the right channel of the river. We were considerably annoyed by this delay, and by the rain, which continued for three days without a moment's intermission. Every thing was com pletely soaked, and, darkness coming on, we Avere obliged to anchor for the night. Next day, at two o'clock, after passing an old Turkish fortress called Semandria, Ave came to Drencova, where the boat ought to have arrived eighteen hours sooner. We had imagined there Avould here have been an inn and a town, and, at least for one night, the means of getting rest on shore, and a temporary escape from our cold, damp habitation on the Danube ; but all these hopes were blighted on seeing this deplorable place. A SAvamp, on Avhich stood a church, a barn, and tAvo or three small huts, was all this station boasted ; and to reach this in a deluge of rain, and knee-deep in mud, was not an inviting prospect. We therefore decided on remaining on board till next morning, r"], [84, "66 SCENERY OF THE DANUBE. when we were to embark for OrsoAra, a passage Avhich can only be effected in boats, and requires daylight. Thursday, 22. \u2014 At an early hour, exactly a week after our departure from Vienna, the boats were rowed alongside the Zryny. A large one was filled AA'ith luggage, carriages, and merchandize ; a second took twenty-five passengers ; and lastly, one was reserved for us and our servants. The rain, as usual, fell incessantly. The boat had ten oars that were unequally used, and changed ac cording to the steersman's direction. There was also a sail when the wind was favourable, but sometimes it was entirely withdrawn, and at others the men rested on their oars, and Ave floated down the current. A small cabin, like a covered barge, sheltered us from the pitiless rain. The scenery on each side the Danube is very grand, much more so than that of the Rhine ; still there is a sameness in this succession of craggy heights, and the eye wearies of the feathered rocks, wild and picturesque as they are, clad in au tumnal colours. For miles and miles the same"], [85, "SINGULAR GROTTO. 67 scenery continues, and hardly a hut or the appear ance of a habitation breaks the solitude of these shores. The woods are full of wild boars, bears, and stags. We passed a grotto or cave, said to be large enough to contain thirty thousand persons, and the captain pointed out to us Trajan's table, a slab of marble with a Latin inscription. The old Ro man road runs along the cliff that bounds the river side. We did not, hoAvever, land from our boats. This extremely capricious river winds along, sometimes becoming very narroAv, at others sAvelling into wide channels, and ever rushing like an angry torrent. The boatmen were, in appearance, hardly human, so savage Avere their looks and attire, the latter consisting of black or Avhite sheepskin wrap ped round their persons, with caps of the same ma terial. The captain, a gentlemanlike, intelligent man, told me that, when the steam-navigation first commenced, these poor people Avere in a state of absolute barbarism. One of them had his fingers covered with strange rings he had obtained from the Zingari, or gipsies, who abound in Wallachia. f 2"], [86, "68 ORSOVA. He sold me one, and seemed enchanted with his bargain. The Hungarian flag floated at our stern, and I Avas struck with its peculiarity.

A magnificent road has been made from Dren cova to Orsova, and finished in a solid and perfect manner, with a Avail along the edge of the river. The Austrian company deserve great credit for the efforts they have made, as far as they go ; the un dertaking is gigantic, but as yet in its infancy ; much remains to be done ; still, by energetic per severance, it must ultimately succeed, and repay them ; and the commercial advantages to the coun try, as well as the benefit it will be to the civiliza tion of the people, are all too apparent to require a comment. At one o'clock Ave reached Orsova, Avhich is on the Wallachian side of the Danube, and has no communication Avith the opposite or Turkish shore."], [87, "69 ORSOVA. We Avere met by the agent of the company, who conducted us to a house where three or four little rooms Avere reserved for us, while the rest of the party repaired to some Avretched inn. Quarantine is performed here, on returning from Constanti nople, and there is a large Lazzaretto about a mile from the town. On an island opposite is a Turkish fortress. I walked doAvn to the waterside, and witnessed a curious scene. A small place is railed in, where the Turks are permitted to land, and buy or sell, but they are not suffered to pass the enclosure, and even their money is passed over in Avater, Avith a vieAv of arresting any infection of plague or fever. This scene had a strange aspect, interesting Iioav ever from its novelty. The Aveather at length relented and changed ; the rain ceased, the sun came out, and all once more looked bright.

After our week's imprisonment, inhaling the baneful damp and poisonous mists of the Danube, Ave were delighted to find ourselves in a hut on land. For the first time in my life, I enjoyed a stove, which I in general dislike, finding that the extreme heat it throAVS out ahvays causes headache. Next morning we left Orsova, and had a long walk to the shore, and of course Avere conducted by the most circuitous road.

The baths of Mehadia are near, and the quarantine, added to its being a station Avhere there must be a halt, will induce people to build and settle ; indeed, a good many houses are already commenced. At present, however, it is dismal enough, and nothing can be worse managed than the whole matter. Arriving as we did at one o'clock on Thursday, we might have re-embarked immediately, or proceeded by land, but for the foolish and absurd arrangements which require that the boatmen or conducteurs going to Skela Gladova, a distance of tAvo hours, should return to Orsova before sunset. A day is thus lost, and all the quarantine, however useful (if properly enforced), is now a complete farce and"], [90, "72 CUSTOM-HOUSE ANNOYANCES. absurdity ; so much communication unavoidably occurs, that it Avould be mere delusion to imagine there Avould be any safety if there were real infec tion. Monsieur Tomisch, the agent, a very pompous person, was not there, but another person attended, and saw the passengers and luggage deposited in three boats as before, with this difference, that they Avere smaller, more grotesque and barbarous, than the former ones. A place with seats, in the middle of each boat, is covered at the top, but open on all sides. Four oars are used at one end, and two at the other. A strange, half-clothed savage squatted at the stern, and steered with a pole. A dirty, heavy, important old German sat at the other end, with an enormous pipe hooked on to his teeth, in the approved Vienna fashion, a place for a wire being bored or filed in the loAver teeth.

Safety, hoAvever, certainly depends on skilful steering, for the slightest touch of the rocks Avould upset the boat, and then the best swimmer could have no chance of escape, so strong is the current among these rapids. We passed a Wallachian village, if a few mise rable huts can be so called, for such barbarous"], [92, "74 SKELA GLADOVA. and squalid misery I never beheld. The scenery changed, and the banks of the river became flat. A large magazine of wood, and a great fishery, were pointed out. Sturgeon is caught in the Danube, also the sterling, Avhich is much esteemed. The Wallachians shoot the bears, boars, and wolves, with which the woods abound, but the Servians never attempt to destroy them. At the end of two hours, Skela Gladova Avas in sight. On the SAvampy shore were a barn and a hut, and close at hand lay the Pannonia, a wretched little steamer, of thirty-six horse poAver. She saluted, the colours Avere hoisted, and I Avished to embark directly from the boats, but, as usual, these obstinate people Avould manage in their own way, and that of course was the most disagreeable and inconvenient. They therefore deposited us and our luggage on shore, on a piece of neutral ground ; the boxes, trunks, &c. were then picked up and carried into the steamer, by a tribe of wild-looking barbarians, consisting of Wallachs, Servians, and Turks ; and the captain, an Italian, was conducting me on board, Avhen he chanced to"], [93, "75 TROUBLES OF STEAMING. look round, and seeing the other passengers, and, farther behind, the luggage-boat Avith the carriages, he exclaimed, \" Ah, per Dio, e troppo !' The agent at Orsova not having informed him of Avhat was coming, he had already four carriages on board ; there was no room left for another, and none could be unshipped without unloading all the merchandize, which was piled up to half the height of the engine. In this dilemma he ordered a large boat to be attached, in which our carriage was placed, and also a tilbury from England, going out for Achmet Pacha. By this time all the passengers had arrived, and among the rest the Turkish doctor, carrying a box of pineapples for the sultan's sister, who was a bride. He said he watched the case like the apple of his eye. Emir Pacha also appeared with his usual sang froid, never seeming hurried, or discomposed. And now how shall I describe the Pannonia steamer?

This wretched little vessel had been twenty years on the station, and apparently all that time collecting its deposit of dirt. There is, hoAvever, a point of dirtiness which nothing can pass, and this, I think the Pannonia must have reached, for never was such a place seen, and I doubt if any abode destined for pigs could be Avorse. The ansAver to all complaints and remonstrances as to the discomfort of the navigation is, that the enterprise is yet in its infancy. But really, after enduring all the miseries of damp, dirt, delay, confinement, and mismanagement, this was a trial not to be patiently endured; and be it remem bered that I, Avho describe the state of the Pan nonia, never saw its lower regions, which I am told surpassed in abominations all the rest. Here"], [95, "77 THE PANNONIA STEAMER. forty passengers Avere stOAved in a place where tAvelve would have been badly off. JeAvs, Turks, and Christians Avere packed into the cabins, or rather holes, like herrings in a barrel. Cigars, AA'ith their attendant nuisances, were not wanting ; bugs, fleas, and vermin abounded ; in short, the horrors of this abode defy all description. Necessary evils must be borne ; but much of these might be avoided. Covered boats might be had, for crossing the rapids ; a fine iron steamer, of one hundred horse-poAver, drawing little water, should be established, for the Danube is deep enough to admit of one. Passengers should be pro perly accommodated, and the merchandize sent by different vessels. These discomforts are prin cipally owing to mismanagement and mistaken economy. On arriving on board the Pannonia, I asked to be shown my cabin. \" Mais, madame, il n'y en a pas, mais je me serai un plaisir de vous ceder le mien.\" I said that a private one had been bespoken and paid for three Aveeks before, at Vienna, and"], [96, "78 WRETCHED ACCOMMODATION. therefore I must have one ; upon which I Avas shown a den, full of the dirty captain's dirtier things. It Avas on deck, over the paddle-box, and close to the engine, and was more like a wooden box or dog-kennel than any thing else ; the only difference a well-bred Englisli mastiff would have found between it and his home was, that it was much more filthy, and perhaps a little larger. A similar hole, appertaining to the en gineer, was yielded to Lord L., and here we were expected to pass five days. Our sufferings, hoAvever, were not yet complete. The beautiful day gave us hopes that the weather would settle favourably for us, and a bright sun and blue sky afforded us courage to bear a great deal. We had not, however, passed tAvelve hours in our neAv abode when the deluge recommenced ; tor rents of rain fell, and soaked every thing; our only consolation, as the water poured into my wretched cabin, was the hope that it might drown the fleas ; but even of this comfort we were de prived by the dirty Wallachs, who, in mopping up the rain, probably brought in more."], [97, "79 THE CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS. We passed by the Carpathian mountains, covered with snow, and next day, Saturday, 24th, we Avere buoyed up in the tedious hours which Avere dragged through, by the hope of finding our selves at Rutschuk early. But we AA'ere doomed to be disappointed. We anchored at sunset, owing to the captain's fears of sand-banks, and all retired to rest, in anxious expectation of the morroAV. I spent a miserable night ; the cold and thick fog seemed to penetrate my Avretched abode, and I felt as if I inhaled fever and imbibed poison ; mental anxiety mingling with bodily suffering. Next morning we found ourselves, as the Turkish doctor termed it, \" assis sur un bane de sable.\" After three or four hours spent in knocking, thumping, casting out, and weighing anchors, we were for a moment clear, but the next moment we floundered again. The last \" fix\" was Avorse than the first, and it was one o'clock before we were fairly off, and the vessel went ahead. Certainly fortune frowned upon this expedition. Had Ave sailed by the preceding, or"], [98, "80 GIURGIVO. waited for the next steamer, Ave should have had the moon, an invaluable assistance at all times, and here more than anyAvhere. Our vessel also kept the Wallachian shore, Avhile the other side, which is taken in the alternate voyages, would have been more interesting, and, in our case, more convenient. The dreadful Aveather also multiplied all our ills. I find in that useful handbook of Murray's, which, as far as my experience and observation go, is usually correct, that tAvo or three days ought to suffice for the passage to Galatz in sum mer, and four in winter. We, alas, came on board the Pannonia on Friday the 23rd, and not till Monday the 26th did we reach Rutschiik, Avhich is but half the distance. I must correct myself, for the steamer did not stop there, it being on the Servian side, but at Giurgivo, oppo site, on the Wallachian coast. This place is only seven hours from Bucharest, the capital of the province, which is governed by the Hospodar, or hereditary Prince, appointed by the Porte.

At length we arrived at Giurgivo, and our miserable little steamer fired her cannon Avith as much pretension as if she had been a seventy-four gun ship. It was rather absurd in this Avretched habitation to see the display of the flags of Eng land and Turkey, and all this mockery of national colours. A more dismal place than Giurgivo cannot Avell be imagined. From the ceaseless tor rents of rain the Avhole place was a SAvamp, and tAvo open barns for merchandize Avere the only buildings in sight. The agent for the company, M. Stunde, Avas in attendance, and Ave found him a very obliging, intelligent man. We gave him our letters, un folded our plans, and told him of our project of crossing the Balkan. This he at once discounte nanced, saying it Avas impracticable for a lady. He informed us that there were neither roads nor houses, but small huts, \" oii le pere, la mere, les G"], [100, "82 CROSSING THE BALKAN. enfants, et les bestiaux\" lived together, and where no traveller could sleep ; that neither meat, bread, nor any thing but eggs, were to be got ; that all which could form a caravan must be taken with us, and that the loss of time and the expense were incalculable. Finally, he said that \" un milord Anglais\" had performed the journey in summer, and spent eight weeks on the roads, for that the horses Avere \" de mauvais petits animaux, grands comme des chiens, mourants sur la route.\" We then asked if we could reach Varna by land, and be picked up by the steamer there, as she passed to Constantinople. This he assured us Avas equally difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish in the time, and Ave Avere therefore compelled to abide our fate in the Pannonia. The agent very civilly offered us two rooms in his house ; and, too happy to be warm and dry on shore for a few hours, Ave accepted his hospitality. A Avretched carriage, with tAvo little wild horses, and driven by a savage-looking being, conveyed us rapidly over the three miles to the village.

On arriving, we took possession of our little rooms and a small kitchen, and, having brought every thing with us, prepared for our supper and a night's rest. I cannot say we were comfort able; bugs and fleas abounded, the smoke was suffocating, and the heat of the stoves intense. Still it was comparative luxury to be out of the confinement and damp of the Pannonia. Next morning we were obliged to be up at five, and make all haste to return on board again, the Austrian colonel having declared that, if the pas sengers Avere not ready at six, the vessel must proceed without them. This would not have had the effect of hurrying me, for I knew that he dared not, even if he had the power, put his threat into execution ; but, first, Ave were unwilling to make anybody wait ; and, secondly, Ave were ourselves most anxious to get on, and avoid fur ther delay.

At ten o'clock, however, our hopes Avere again blighted, for the rain recommenced more violently than ever ; it inundated the Avhole deck, and poured into my cabin.

HereAve left a considerable quantity of merchandize, and another hour brought us to Galatz, Avhere the steamer from Constantinople had not arrived. The Austrian consul, a very smart young man, immediately rushed on board to meet his bride. The river was so low that the vessel could not approach the shore ; but a rough bridge was soon constructed by the Wallachs, and the only difficulty now seemed to be how to find a lodging. This was pronounced impossible. The governor ofthe town sent word that a house should be found next day ; but, all impatient as Ave Avere to escape from the steamer, in which we had now been confined six days, this appeared too long to Avait. The English vice-consul, Mr. Cunningham, offered us two rooms, but as they were full of sick people, we declined them. The inn Avas only such by name, being nothing more than a hut. The Austrian consul most kindly placed his house at our disposition ; but, knoAving his situation, Ave were unAvilling to accept his offer, although he pressed"], [105, "87 WALLACHIAN HOSPITALITY. us, saying, \" Ma fiancee ue peut pas etre chez moi, parceque nous ne somiues pas encore maries.\" The only person Avho could have lodged us, would not \u2014 namely, the agent of the Austrian company, a sulky, ill-conditioned old man, Avith a fox-like expression of countenance.

While these negociations Avent on, a very civil message arrived from the major in command ofthe regiment quartered at Galatz, begging us to come to his house. Accordingly, we got into a primitive sort of vehicle, and were driven with great rapi dity in the dark, up hill and down dale, over un even ground ; and, after twenty minutes' shaking, Ave arrived at our destination, and were conducted up a ladder, by a young man in a fine uniform.

She begged me to make myself perfectly at home, assuring me she Avas quite accustomed to receive strangers, for, as there Avere no inns, she ahvays offered hospitality. She then left us, desiring us to ask for Avhatever Ave Avanted. Soon aftenvards, a Moldavian Avoman came in and burned perfumes. Her dress Avas poor, but national and becoming. A handkerchief was tied round her head like a turban, but knotted in front ; long hanging plaits fell upon her shoulders ; and she Avore a catzaveka, or jacket, with loose sleeves lined with fur.

I Avaited to see Avhat the little creature Avanted, for all the other visits had been under the pretence of fetching something out of the various draAvers ; but when at length the child seated itself, and there remained staring at me, this was not to be borne, and I was obliged to send a petition to the lady of the house, praying her to order that I might be left to myself. Thursday and Friday were spent in anxiously Avatching for the arrival of the steamer, which was so unaccountably delayed. We talked over the land journey, but found little encouragement to under take it, the loss of time and the difficulties attend ing it rendering it almost impossible. A ball Avas given for us, under the governor's di rection, by Monsieur Negrepont, a rich merchant. The most curious thing was the band of music that played alternately with the military band. It was composed of Zingari, or gipsies, and, considering the o-rotesque instruments they used, and that they never had learnt a note of music, I was surprised"], [108, "90 GALATZ. at hearing hoAv well they played a mazourka, which was danced with great spirit.

A more wretched spot than Galatz can hardly be imagined. Not a street is paved, the Avhole place is a swamp filled with ruts, and the people are, apparently, absolute barbarians. The old town consists of mere mud huts, and a large plain or encampment, covered with little carts laden with corn, and drawn by oxen. But the trade and commerce are increasing, and a new town is rising on a height, where the consuls have their houses. Even this, hoAvever, is very miserable, and it will be long ere this place can wear a habitable or civi lized appearance.

No place is more dependent on fine Aveather than Constantinople. It requires sunshine to beautify and light it up. We came, too, with overAvrought expectations. After reading Miss Pardoe's descriptions, and gazing on the lovely prints and drawings of Constantinople, \"on se fait un beau ideal,\" that can hardly be re alised, for in truth one is taught to expect a fairy land. To begin, the mountains are mere hills, and their appearance is neither grand nor sublime.

I expected to find the rich variety of form and colour Avhich is to be seen in the domes and cupolas of Moscow ; but here was neither gilding nor variegated hue ; the buildings Avere one glaring mass of whiteAvash. Still the scene, as a Avhole, is undeniably beautiful ; the enormous size, the prodigious masses of buildings, strike the stranger, who asks if it be not the largest city in the world, forgetting what London or Paris Avould be if taken in at one view, and presented before his eyes like a panorama. The Golden Horn is a kind of bay, surrounded by hills, which are covered with buildings, domes, and minarets, doAvn to the water's edge. The Seraglio Point, the dark tall cypresses, the delicious colour ing of an eastern sky, with the stir and gaiety of vessels of all sorts, steamers, traders, yachts, and myriads of graceful little caiques, all these, on a bright sunny day, form a scene beyond descrip tion enchanting."], [117, "99 AMBASSADORS. All Christians are denominated Franks, and none are alloAved to reside in Constantinople ; their principal residence is Pera, which is connected with Galata, and on the opposite side. It is therefore ne cessary to descend the hill, and cross the water, and make a circuitous journey to arrive at Constanti nople, where the bazaar, mosques, &c, are situated. The Austrian ambassador, Baron de Stunner, lives at Pera, in a charming house, Avith a beautiful garden, commanding a fine view of the Bosphorus ; but the approach is doAvn a long, narrow, craggy lane, AA'here scarcely carriage or horse can go, and I could only reach it on foot, or in the evening, when the baroness kindly sent me her sedan-chair, porters, &c. A fine palace is building for the Rus sian ambassador, so large and magnificent that ill-natured people pretend it is to be the residence of the emperor, AA'hen, in future time, he shall take possession of Constantinople. Here also the English government should build a palace to replace the one that was burnt ; but Lord Ponsonby prefers residing at Tarapia, that he may remain secluded and undisturbed. This arrangement is particularly h 2"], [118, "100 ARABAS. inconvenient to all who may have to transact busi ness at the embassy. One of the greatest draAvbacks to a residence here, is the difficulty of getting about ; in fact, it almost amounts to an impossibility : the narrow streets and steep, stony ascents are not calculated for any English carriage, and the jolting threatens dislocation of the bones. The carriages of the country are Avretched vehicles, light enough to be lifted out ofthe way Avhen necessary. I tried an araba, a sort of covered carriage, open at the sides, Avith curtains and a mattress, but Avithout steps or springs. Into this you climb, and lie down, but I found it perfectly intolerable. It is, however, the sole A-ehicle used by the ladies, and sometimes four or five pack in, Avhile occasionally an indolent beauty reclines in solitude. After the terrible descent from Pera to Tophana quay, from Avhence you cross the Golden Horn and land at Constantinople, a high hill is to be as cended, and for this purpose horses must be found.

Here a long range of embroidery and gay colours extends on each side, but the rest is dull and sombre. Then the dirt and the want of air and light, and the terrible pavement (if the uneven stones deserve the name), render walking painful, and riding dangerous. The furs appeared to me very inferior. I had expected to find magnificent sables, but I saw only piles of fox and Avolf-skins. It is, moreover, very difficult to make these Turkish shopkeepers exhibit any thing. They pull your sleeve, and arrest you AA'ith the greatest eagerness ; but, when once they have"], [120, "102 VARIOUS COSTUMES. fixed your attention, and made you stop, they will merely show what happens to be put out, and it is only Avhen you are going aAvay displeased, that they produce any thing likely to suit or meet your views ; and they ask double and sometimes treble the value of their merchandize.

The absence of all European remini scences, in the midst of this strange and novel scene, strikes the mind very much. But it is sur prise and astonishment that occupy you, rather than admiration ; and, indeed, nothing can be more curious than these bazaars. The extremes of poverty and magnificence, of refinement and bar barism, the mingled costumes, the noise, confu sion, and variety of the whole, form a scene totally different from any thing elseAvhere to be found.

All their dresses were of cotton ; some had jackets trimmed Avith fur ; and one enormous woman, Avho evidently considered herself a beauty, wore nothing but transparent muslin to her waist. Tavo slaves near the door sung, or rather howled, while another played on the tambourine. I was then led into the adjoining room, a sort of hall, covered with the finest mats, and from thence con ducted to the bath, the cooling-room, and the mar ble fountain, with the two sources for hot and cold water. The excessive heat made me pant, which amused them extremely ; they all ran and waddled about, with their long tails training after them, and AA'ithout shoes or slippers ; and, having shown me the house, which is quite new, and very hand some, they conducted me to a raised step at the top of the hall, and the slaves sung, and were be ginning to dance, when a sudden whisper and vio lent bustling about announced the return of Reschid Pacha. The neighbours immediately took flight and dis appeared, it being forbidden that a strange man"], [129, "RESCHID'S HOUSEHOLD. 111 should see their faces. The slaves and Reschid's own household remained at the farther end of the hall, and he took a chair near his wife, Madame Franchini, and me. The only person who ap proached us Avas an old Avoman, who came up the steps and squatted down. Reschid said : \u2014 \" C'est ma mere, c'est a. dire, ce n'est pas ina vraie mere, mais ma mere de lait.\" Reschid then commenced conversation ; and much mutual compliment passed among us all, according to Turkish fashion. Unfortunately it was discovered that one of my pearls had dropped, and, as it could not be found after a long search, much discomfort was created ; poor Madame Reschid declaring it was the only drawback to the enjoyment of her evening. My first attempt to take leave was resisted ; I was told I was \" trop pressee;\" I said I Avas afraid of intruding, and the answer Avas that the duty of re ceiving me became a pleasure, \" et que nos ames sympathisaient.\" At length I was alloAved to take my departure, and was conducted by the khanoun, the slaves sol-"], [130, "112 TURKISH WOMEN. lowing; and Reschid, aa-1io was evidently suffering from a severe cold, gave me his arm to the door, where the appearance of a man, in the shape of my English footman, who had arrived Avith my cloak, alarmed the slaves, who, after a moment's giggling and scuffling, disappeared. This visit was certainly curious, and very inte resting ; but I Avas greatly disappointed not to see any beauty of face or figure ; indeed the latter struck me as positively frightful, and none of the women looked young. Even the children had an old, set, parboiled, unhealthy look ; all seemed dirty, and the absence of any magnificence of cos tume gave them an insignificant appearance. I saw neither velvet, silk, nor embroidery ; all their dresses Avere made of coarse, coloured cotton, and possessed neither shape nor beauty.

Next day we roAved round the Seraglio Point, nearly to the Seven Towers, passing the Mosques of St. Sophia, and of Sultans Achmet, Bajazet, and Suleiman. The approach to Constantinople by the Sea of Marmora is decidedly the most advan tageous. I was delighted with the scenery, and the day was like one in summer. The following day Madame Franchini and I set out in the Seraskier's carriage, to visit his harem. The streets, as usual, Avere crowded, but at last we reached the residence of the Seraskier, Avho has a fine palace, and is commander-in-chief of all the land forces. The harem is in a retired corner, and, on the door being opened, only ourselves were admitted. On entering, we found several slaves, and a very beautiful odalisque. They took me by the elbows, and helped me to ascend the stairs, Avhich, as well as the floors, Avere covered Avith the finest matting. Soon after, Madame Moustapha, the chief lady, appeared.

She sat down by me on a Ioav divan, but, on the Seraskier's being announced, she jumped up and remained standing, with her arms crossed over her bosom. He is a finedooking man, betAveen fifty and sixty. He sat on a chair near me, but unfortunately could not speak a word of French. After many speeches and civilities, according to oriental usage, he invited me to dine a la Turque with the ladies.

The windows were gilt lattices ; it was completed Avithin a year, and is in very good taste. The room is like a large saloon, well fitted up and carpeted ; in the middle is the coffin, or catafalque, surrounded by railings of mother-of-pearl, and covered with red velvet richly embroidered in gold. Four magni- ficent cachemires were laid on the coffin, and the fez, or red cap, with the diamond aigrette and heron plume, hung over it. Crowds of women were there, their yashmacs tightly folded, and only their eyes visible. Men of various sects and costumes appeared praying on their carpets, and all Avere required to leave their slippers at the door.

This fashion was brought from Paris by Achmet Pacha, and is, I should imagine, little adapted to Turkish gravity. At length we returned, and, having ascended the stairs with the same ceremony as before, the party assembled, and the prepa rations for dinner began. The Seraskier has generally chosen and bought Circassians, and his harem is quite Eastern, and altogether unreformed by European fashions. Four of his wives were very beautiful, and all Avere good looking; their toilets were all in the same style, only varied in colours. Some had caftans of Avadded silk, Avith large, heavy, gold leaves.

Nothing can be harder than the situation of these unfor- tunate Avomen, as they are scarcely ever permitted to stir out. I discovered they had only been al lowed to breathe the open air twice in the year. The Seraskier told me he once took them to the SAA'eet Waters of Asia, and Avas amused at my ex pressive look of horror at such confinement. I could not help pitying their fate, all living toge ther, quarrelling and jangling for the Pacha's favour, \" a qui il jeterait le mouchoir.\" I did not count the children, but I think there were not fewer than twelve.

They sipped the latter, and, breaking off bits of bread from the pieces of roll placed before each person, dipped them into the various sauces. The Pacha's mother invited me to sit near her, and on the other side Avere the Khanoun and her boy ; next came the second Avife, a beautiful Cir cassian girl, Avith one of her children ; then an old Greek lady, Avho had come with her daughters to assist at the ceremony ; and then Madame Franchini.

They prefer a resting-place in Asia to Europe, fearing that Constantinople may at some future day fall into the hands of the giaour, who would disturb their ashes.

I ahvays pretended to practise the former, by merely discarding my clogs ; either alternative will do ; but some method or change must be adopted, as it offends them that Avhat they hold sacred should be trodden by dirty shoes. We found about twenty dervishes, with high, round, felt caps, and brown mantles. Tavo old men with silver beards were dressed in green, with white turbans. They walked round and round, boAving, and turning sloAvly several times. They then cast off their mantles, and appeared\" in full, bell-shaped petticoats and jackets, their feet being bare ; and they commenced dancing or"], [163, "145 SLAVE MARKET. whirling, for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, with the most surprising velocity. Wild music was played in a gallery above, and they kept perfect time ; no confusion or jostle occurred, and they seemed insensible to giddiness, though I felt my head turn while only gazing. It is a most eccen tric exhibition, as a religious ceremony, and is sup posed to have some connexion with the Avorship of the sun, though how, I could neither learn nor un derstand. I had been charged not to laugh ; but, really, I never felt disposed to do so. Still, it is sad mummery, and great absurdity to imagine their tAvisting and dancing can be acceptable to God. We then descended to Tophana ; and, reaching the other side, after a roAv over the Bosphorus, I mounted a horse, to go to the slave-market. It is not far from the bazaars, but on this occasion, the day being advanced, it was nearly empty.

One day we roAved doAvn the Bosphorus, to see some horses belonging to a pacha who lived near Tarapia. We landed, and were sIioavii to the house of Moustapha Pacha, and found some mistake had arisen, and that he was not at home, and had no stable. We inquired further, and found that the horses belonged to another pacha, Mehemet Ali, who had been a great man in Sultan Mahmoud's reign, but being now rather under a cloud, was consequently the more tenacious and proud. We received permission to see the stables, and the horses were paraded. We then returned to the boat, and Lord L. went to thank the pacha, who showed him his house, pictures, &c, and pressed him to stay for coffee and pipes. Being unwilling to make me wait, he declined, and avc aftenvards heard that this"], [169, "CLOSE OF THE BAIRAM. 151 gave mortal offence, and the pacha's indignation knew no bounds. He said he was as dirt, that dirt had been heaped upon him, and that we should not have any of his horses for five thousand guineas. After three days' firing and rejoicing, at length the Bairam ceased, and the confusion subsided ; and on Monday morning, November 30th, I was desired to proceed to the Tscheragan palace, for my audience of the sultan. Some difficulty occurred as to AA'hom I should select to accompany me. Madame Franchini Avas objected to by some, as too great a proof of the court arrangements being under Russian influence. Reschid Pacha undertook to interpret, and it Avas suggested I might go alone. This, however, seemed inconvenient. I therefore asked Mrs. Walker, the wife of Captain Walker, of the British navy, but who had recently been made a Turkish admiral, to go with me, and she gladly acceded. Accordingly, at eleven o'clock, on a cold, snowy morning, we packed ourselves into a small close carriage (the first covered one I had seen in Turkey, and kindly sent us by Reschid Pacha), and we set out, preceded as usual by guards and kee-"], [170, "152 PRELIMINARY CEREMONIES. vasses. The road, like all others in this country, Avas dreadful, and Ave were shaken to pieces, until, after a long descent down a steep declivity, we found ourselves at a palace presenting a long facade to the sea, on the Pera, or European side. Here we were shoAvn through an open court, the guard being turned out to receive us. In Turkey, the outward slippers are ahvays left at the door, the floors being covered Avith the finest mats, the rooms carpeted, and not a speck or particle of dust to be seen. We entered a small Avaiting-room, Avhere we found some Austrian officers, Avho Avere also aAvaiting their au dience. They informed me of what I had not dis covered, that the place appointed had been changed, and that I Avas not, as I imagined, in the Tschera gan palace, but in the Beshiktasch ; that they had already gone to the former, and found no one ; and that there appeared to be singular confusion in all the arrangements. Coffee Avas handed to us in tiny cups, not containing above a thimbleful, but placed in the most exquisite little jeAA'elled stands or egg-cups, of pink enamel and diamonds.

At length they all went away, leaving Mrs. Walker and me with the Austrian strangers, who were much amused at the sensation produced by the appearance of a Frank woman within these Avails ; it being, I belie\\Te, the first instance of a formal audience being granted to a lady. The Turks occasionally lifted up the curtain over the entrance into the room, and peeped in to gaze at me. I was in full court dress ; and this toilet, so unusual, especially to Turks, unaccustomed as they are to see any ladies in public, added to their astonishment. Mrs. W., the only lady who had ever been received, had been attired in a hat, and without jeAvels, having unfortunately left hers at Odessa.

A great step has been made in the approach to civilization, and probably this will continue, and perhaps, in a few years, ladies will be received at the Ottoman court in the same manner as at any other. At length, Reschid Pacha, the Marechal du Palais, and other attendants, returned, having put on their diamond decorations ; and after waiting again for some time (for nothing in Turkey is ever done in a hurry,) I was requested to folloAV them. I expected to enter some adjoining room, where the sultan would receive me, but, to my surprise, I was desired to put on my furs, my clogs, and my cloak, and I followed them down stairs, crossed an open court, and arrived at a long terrace or gar den, at the end of which stood the palace.

A shudder came over me, as I thought how readily that trap-door might close over its victims, and my blood ran cold while my imagination made the mute inquiry, who can tell on whom that barrier has closed ?

We were then ushered through long suites of apartments, expecting every moment to find our selves in the presence of the sultan. At length, on arriving at a small side ante-room, Avhen I was the least prepared for the meeting, Abdul Mehjid walked in quickly, and suddenly stood before us. The usual fez was on his head, a full military cloak hung round him, clasped at the throat AA'ith an agrafe of enormous diamonds. A large solitaire ring was on his little finger.

He did not bow to me, but immediately began talking to Reschid Pacha, who, having paid his homage, Avhich is done by appearing gracefully to pick up the dust from the feet, according to the expression, je baise la poussiere, interpreted to me the sultan's pleasure and satisfaction at seeing me, and his hope that I \"had recovered the fatigue of my journey.

I requested Reschid to express my admiration of Constantinople, my gratification at my visit and reception, and my thanks for having been allowed to see every thing that was curious and interest ing. The sultan inquired if I had visited the Tscheragan palace, and, on my ansAvering in the negative, he desired orders to be given that it might be shown to me. He then asked who was the lady that accompanied me, and being told her"], [176, "158 RESCHID PACHA. name, he desired Reschid Pacha to express the pleasure he felt at having an opportunity of telling her how highly he valued her husband's services. After a happily Avorded reply from her, that she had equal delight in being able to assure his ma jesty that he had not a more faithful servant than Admiral Walker, the sultan expressed his regrets at my intention of leaving Constantinople so soon, and then vanished as suddenly as he had appeared. I was re-conducted to the door of the palace by Reschid Pacha and the Marechal du Palais, who eagerly inquired Avhat I thought of their imperial master. They seemed pleased Avith the praise and admiration I expressed, and Reschid Pacha inter preted to the other all I said ; and mentioned also my having twice seen the sultan dismount from his horse on the Constantinople quay, and enter his beautiful caique, to return to his palace on the Pera side. I then took leave of Reschid, endea vouring to describe our gratitude for all his kind ness and protection. The troops lined the courts, and were under arms as I passed.

This singular person is by birth a Genoese, and his history is worth recording, though I regret many links are wanting in the chain. At ten years old, having run away from his parents, and AA'orked a passage, he found himself in the streets of Con stantinople Avithout shoes or stockings.

He gave most entertaining accounts of his search for pirates, who, he said, came, like the finest honey, from the island of Cerigo.

But I fear no description can do G. justice, or convey the least idea of his singular character. Next day, Tuesday 29 th, Ave anchored off Co rinth, at Leutrachi, in a small bay, surrounded by mountains, and scarcely a habitation visible. We found that to ride from thence to Athens by Me gara would take tAvo days, that there was only a bridle-road, and there were no inns ; while an hour Avould be sufficient to take us across the isthmus to Callimachi, where we hoped to find some vessel to convey us to the Pir\u00e6us.

The road was flat and good, the day lovely, and the scenery enchanting, and we had advanced about half way, Avhen we were met by Captain Lyon, who had preceded us, and returned to say that there was no place at Callimachi, the only station, where AA'e could possibly spend the night \u2014"], [197, "LEUTRACHI. 179 no inn, no provisions, no boats, in fact, nothing.

The officer began, \" Mais voulez vous m'expliquer pourquoi vous vous battez?\" \" Mais pour l'honneur,\" replied the Frenchman, \" et vous ?\" \" Pour l'argent,\" an swered the Austrian; \"chacun se bat pour ce qui lui manque.\" We determined, if the answer did not come the next day from Athens, that we would devote it to visiting Corinth, and climbing the Acropolis. Being fine weather, we set out, the captain dis liking the expedition, from his avoAved bad opinion of the country and the people. \" Voila trente ans,\" said he, \" que je suis dans ces parages, et je les connais, ces animaux.\" Then he told a story of the purser of a frigate who had lagged behind his companions in walking to Corinth, when all of a sudden they missed him, and though they imme diately turned back, and ten minutes had not elapsed since they lost sight of him, no trace n 2"], [198, "180 SIR EDMUND LYONS. of him was ever afterwards discovered. It is supposed he had been murdered for a large silver gilt chain he wore round his neck ; but neither he nor any thing belonging to him was ever again seen. Just as we were starting, a messenger arrived with a letter from Sir Edmund Lyons, saying that the Russian minister had, with great conside ration, sent us a fine man-of-Avar cutter to take us to Athens ; Ave therefore returned to the steamer to pack up, and at about three o'clock we all started as on the previous day. The distance be tween the two seas is hardly five miles, and a more romantic country cannot be imagined. Wild, un cultivated, and uninhabited, the descent into Cal limachi was beautiful ; the distant blue mountains, the sea like glass, and that peculiar colouring only seen in sunny southern climes. Even in winter, I am told, this favoured land has the myrtle and ole ander in full bloom in the open air. On reaching the shore, we found the cutter lying in the bay, and we immediately went on board. She was a man-of-war, with tAvelve guns, fifty men, and eight officers.

The only accommodation wras one very small cabin, with narroAv seats. An excellent dinner had been provided by the Russian minister, who most kindly had the attention to send his cook and servants. The difficulty, however, was Iioav to spend the night, repose for all parties being impossible. A sail was put up as a partition in the cabin, and my maid and I took possession of one side, Lord L., Captain Lyon, and Dr. Forbes, being on the other ; and here, without beds, we settled ourselves, and passed some uncomfortable hours till daylight, AA'hen, to our great regret, we found that at least twelve of the thirty miles remained to be accom- plished. In despair at the prospect of another day and night on board, I asked the captain if we might have the boats, as the day was fine, and there was no appearance of a breath of Avind. He most civilly assented ; three Avere speedily manned, and filled Avith people and luggage, and the eight-oared boat, in which we were, brought us in about three hours to the Pir\u00e6us."], [200, "182 THE ACROPOLIS. We found Sir Edmund Lyons's carriage wait ing for us, and the consul, Mr. Green, a very obliging person, ready to render all assistance. Rooms being taken at the Royal Hotel, Ma dame Cassali's, we at once drove there, and found a cold, straggling, Greek inn, where, however, two fireplaces were an unexpected luxury. We dined with Sir Edmund, a most hospitable, agreeable man. His house was com fortable, with a marble hall and stairs, and must in summer be very pleasant, as the rooms above are warm and quite English in Avinter. On our return home we were glad to find the baggage safely arrived, the cutter having profited by a little breeze to get in. The next day, January 1st, the weather was clear, the morning bright, and we commenced the neAv year by ascending the far-famed Acropolis. It is necessary to have a permission, but, being accompanied by the English minister, no questions were asked, and the little door opened and ad mitted us.

Still, even the unlearned beholder cannot fail to be struck with admiration at these stupendous and wonderful remains, the immense quantity and masses of mar- ble, as well as the magnificent situation. The first object that meets the eye is the propyl\u00e6a or entrance to the Parthenon. It increases the regret caused by the destruction before one, to think that when time had respected these Avorks, avarice, bar- barism, Avar, and the bad passions of mankind should have aggravated and extended the devastation and ruin ; for, although earthquakes have shaken and centuries have passed over them, the chief injuries have been done by the atrocities of war, shells, balls, and gunpoAvder. On the right, on entering, is the Temple of Victory Apteros, a graceful building, lately discovered under a Turkish bat- tery, and skilfully put together. The columns are fluted Ionic ; the wdiole is in miniature, being only twenty feet in length, but very beautiful, and is situated on a little eminence."], [202, "184 THE PARTHENON. Passing between this and the propyl\u00e6a, the Par thenon is before you. It stands on the highest spot of the hill ; and the only feeling that disturbs the mind, Avhile contemplating this unrivalled ruin, is regret and sorroAv that it is no longer the per fect fabric it was. After the first Avonder- stricken gaze, on a closer examination of these massive columns, and seemingly impregnable masonry, the stranger not only marvels how such an edifice could have been finished in seven years, but that it ever was completed at all. The immense Doric co lumns, above six feet in diameter, are fluted ; there are seventeen of a side ; the whole of this and the other buildings of the Acropolis are of Pentelic marble. It was 228 feet long and 100 feet broad. In the interior space a mosque has been built, AA7herein are deposited some remains of cornices and statues. The view from here over the olive plain, the Pir\u00e6us, and the distant mountains, is very extensive and fine. From here is also seen the Areopagus, and the place where Saint Paul was brought up the steps, and preached. I heard an anecdote of an English captain of a"], [203, "185 THE PARTHENON. merchant vessel, who came and entreated Mr. Hill, the American clergyman here, to show him this spot : he ascended it, and, pulling out his Bible, read some of the chapters, preached there, and, after a short prayer, turned to depart, saying he meant to sail that night. \" Will you not visit some of the temples on the hill ?\" said the minister. \" Oh no, sir,\" replied the captain, \" I came to see this place, and have no desire to approach those profane buildings.\" Nor could he be induced to change his decision. Lord L Avrote our names on one of the columns in front of the entrance of the Parthenon, to be perhaps read in after-years by our children, and children's children. We then turned to the Erechtheum, a beautiful building, and, until the last twelve years, quite perfect. During the Avar in 1827, a Greek chief, with all his family, took refuge in its interior. A ball having nearly struck it, they covered the roof with earth. Another shot reached still nearer, and made them pile on more. During the night, a tremendous rain caused the earth to swell, and thus the Aveight Avas so"], [204, "186 TEMPLE OF THESEUS. increased that the roof fell in and killed seventeen persons, and, amongst the rest, several females perished. The southern portico is supported by caryatides, of which three only remain. One has been carried off to St. Petersburg, and another went to London among Lord Elgin's spoils. The sacred olive tree greAV here, and the sup posed tomb of Cecrops is shown. Walking round the exterior, a spot where Lord Durham had climbed to cut his name was pointed out to us, but it was too high to be visible, even with glasses. We saw the Pnyx, or hill, the prison of Socrates. I was anxious to purloin a small bit of marble I had picked up, but the vigilant spies detected the theft, and took it from me as I descended the hill. We then drove to the Temple of Theseus, which stands by itself at the foot of the Acropolis. The walls, the roof, and thirty-four Doric columns, are perfect ; it now forms the museum of Athens. The whole is of white Pentelic marble, but has turned a deep yellow, partly the effect of time, though there is no doubt much has been painted."], [205, "TEMPLE OF JUPITER. 187 From thence we went to the Temple of Jupiter, the largest, finest, and last built of all the wonders of Athens. Only sixteen of 120 columns still exist, and these are indeed very fine. They are six feet and a half in diameter, fluted, and sixty feet high, with Corinthian capitals. The length ofthe building was 354 feet, the breadth 171, and the remains of the platform show the entire circuit must have been 2300 feet. The hills are full of inscriptions and classic recollections. It is to be regretted that King Otho takes little interest in all these triumphs of genius and art; and I Avas told the queen came but once to see the Acro polis. On the other hand, the King of Bavaria was well Avorthy of it ; he paid fifty-six visits, saw it at sunset, watched it through the moonlight, and waited for the sun rising ; but he was not suffered to carry any thing away.

The summer is dusty and Avithout shade, subject to fever and malaria, and the winter cold. On Sunday Ave attended divine service at Sir Edmund Lyons's ; the prayers were read by Mr. Leeves, and a long sermon Avas preached by Mr. Hill ; but both spoke so low that the effort of listening was most painful, and sometimes totally useless. In the afternoon we drove to a place of great public resort, where an excellent band plays, and crowds assemble. Wliile we were there, the royal procession arrived on horseback ; King Otho in the Greek dress, the queen in a most un becoming riding-habit, ugly hat, and green veil, and the Crown Prince of Bavaria, with their suites and attendants. Next day, Monday, 4th, was fixed for my pre sentation to the queen, who was a Princess of Oldenburg, and is a very pleasing person, only twenty-two years of age. Lady Lyons accom panied me, and we were received by a little old lady in blue, who mumbled out some civil speeches, and conducted us to the queen.

The dresses of the Albanians and Greeks but slightly differ from one another, and are very gay and gaudy : the jackets, vests, sleeves, and leggings, are of different coloured cloth or velvet, richly embroidered in gold or silver ; the fus tonella, or petticoat, which hangs like a kilt, is made on the principle of an umbrella, small at the top and full at the bottom, having between three aud four hundred seams. The dress of the women is not pretty, though I saw it on the famed and beautiful Mdle. Botzaris. Tuesday, being our last day, was of course a busy one ; and first I went to the banker's, Avhere I found au overpowering smell of tobacco, one clerk, and no money of any kind, not even dollars. He promised to procure some in an hour ; meanwhile I went to see the lantern of Lysicrates, an elegant little temple, with Corinthian pillars, extremely small ; but, when there was a series of them, (as it was customary for each person Avho won a prize to"], [208, "190 REVIEW. build a tripod to place it upon,) the effect must have been very beautiful.

The general presented me with a sketch of Cape Colonna. A great review was to take place, and to this I went with Lady Lyons, hoping to see some of the Greek costumes. There were about 500 men, partly infantry, partly lancers, dressed in imitation of the Bavarian troops. The general appearance of the crowd Avas picturesque. The Suliote fez, t\\xe fus tanella petticoat, the costume of the wild Palikari, all added to the novelty of the scene. A grand dinner and evening party at the Austrian minister's closed our stay at Athens, which we prepared to leave with extreme regret.

This vessel, as well as a Russian brig just arrived, had been kindly offered to take us to Callimachi, but, dread ing the uncertainty of the wind, we thankfully accepted King Otho's fine steamer. On going on board, we were saluted by the Russian brig, which was returned by the steamer, and our luggage, being all stowed, we started ; and, after a rough passage of five hours, arrived at Callimachi. The captain, who was a Greek, and a sailor from child hood, said he had never been at school, and he spoke nothing intelligible but a very little Italian. The lieutenant, a gentlemanlike young man, was a son of Admiral Miaulis, and, having been educated in England, spoke English well. At Callimachi we found the village quite alive, and no one sober, it being the 6th (old Christmas day), and with the Greeks kept as the true one. It was therefore with difficulty we succeeded in getting the gig and carts to convey us and our baggage across the isthmus.

We had seen the lions of Malta, and had suffi ciently deplored its barrenness and dullness : we likewise visited the cathedral of St. John, which, in days of yore, when the paintings were bright and the gildings fresh, must have been gorgeously magnificent. The pavement is of pietra dura, cover ing the tombs of the knights ; the altar has the rails and doors of solid silver, and was saved by being painted black during the time of the French, who committed various barbarous atrocities, pil laged every thing, and broke and defaced much of the fine pavement. On the lst of February we embarked on board the Dream, accompanied, as usual, by the Merlin, and joined by the Therese, Lord Desart's cutter. In the morning a bright sun and a fresh Avind gave o 2"], [214, "196 VOYAGE TO PALERMO. every hope of a favourable passage. We left the harbour filled with our gallant vessels of war, the Ganges, the Implacable, and the Edinburgh in quarantine ; the Hastings and the Asia ready, the latter preparing, for sea. When wre were outside, it was discovered that the wind would not serve so well for Messina as to go round the other side of the island of Sicily to Palermo, the principal ob ject of interest ; we therefore were obliged to give up the former. We were soon abandoned by Lord Desart, whose destination was Alexandria. The evening of the second day brought us within twenty miles of Palermo, in sight of a command ing, wild, bold coast. Here Ave lay becalmed, viewing the mountains we so anxiously wished to get round. While Ave Avere listlessly gazing on the glassy deep, a turtle was discovered asleep. Some of the sailors proposed trying to catch it ; accordingly the boat was lowered, and they ap proached so gently as not to disturb its slumbers, till with a boat-hook they turned it over on its back, before it had time to recover itself. It was a small one, of the haAvk-billed description, and,"], [215, "197 PALERMO AND ITS ENVIRONS. consequently, not of the best sort. Nevertheless, we put it in a bucket of water, and fed it with bread. Another Avas seen, but, being Avider aAvake than its companion, was not caught. Early on the morning of the 4th we entered the bay of Palermo. The weather was delicious, and as warm as July, and it was impossible to decide Avhich was the clearer and brighter, the sea or the sky, though both Avere of that deep blue never seen in our gloomy isle. The first impression at Palermo is that of finding oneself in a deserted place, sur rounded by faded grandeur, and remains of better days; but the beauty of the situation, and the picturesque appearance of the whole, baffle de scription. The churches, palaces, and houses are generally pretty good, and a quay, or raised ter race by the sea, called the Marina, is overlooked by fine buildings, ending Avith gardens much to be admired. Still I was disappointed, as I vainly sought the Asiatic minarets and eastern palm trees, described by Mrs. Starke.

The inn was straggling and dirty, combining the luxury of satin mattresses, with tiled floors and unwashed stone stairs. While our luggage was unpacking, we drove to La Favorita, the summer palace of the king. The road lay through an avenue of pepper trees, groves of orange and lemon, and olive woods. The distance is about four miles from Palermo ; roses and hyacinths were in full bloom, with a July day. The gardens are neglected and ill kept, but with little trouble might be restored to their pristine excellence. We passed a fountain surrounded by yew-trees of great size, and en tered this Chinese villa. We climbed to the top, and were repaid by a magnificent view of the high mountains, Monte Pellegrino, with its rugged as cent, and the distant city ; while the blue sea was likewise visible on three sides.

The chapel of the palace is remarkable ; it is not large, but in good taste, and lined with gold mosaic. This old style is both precious and costly, and the figures look like lapis lazuli, while the ground is the best ducat gold. Every thing is done in pietra dura ; twelve Egyptian marble columns support the roof, as well as others of valuable porphyry. In the time of the Saracens this church was a mosque. The doors are modern, only just finished ; they are handsome, of inlaid Avood, with tAvo pieces of elabo rate carving, one of \"Our Saviour's walking on the Sea,\" the other, \" Giving the Keys to Saint Peter.\" They were a year making, and cost \u00a3\\40. Near this church is the duomo, the exterior of which has great merit, but the inside is poor and cold, and struck me as out of proportion, and too long for its width. The shrine of St. Rosalia was by chance open, and we had thus au opportunity of seeing the famous sarcophagus, Avhich is of silver, and said to weigh between 1200 and 1300 pounds. Next day we visited some of the marble shops,"], [218, "200 MONTREAL!:. and, having purchased some tables of the different Sicilian specimens, finding the day cloudy, and the ascent to the top of Monte Pellegrino rugged and long, we abandoned the attempt, and drove to Montreale, a town about four miles off.

Our stay was too short for the exe cution of a bust, even had I been tempted to add mine to the collection. His price is i\u00a350. We next went to Gibson, the first artist in Rome, excepting Thonvaldsen. He is a Welshman, but has resided here for tAventy years. He declines executing busts and statues, and prefers fancy sub jects. We saw a beautiful groupe just finished for the Grand Duke of Russia, two colossal statues of Mr. Huskisson, a Shepherd Love for Lord Crewe, and a fine design of a Hunter holding his Dog. Most of the statues were priced at three or four hundred guineas. Mr. Gibson conducted us to Mr. Wyatt's studio, and here we saAV a beautiful piece of sculpture \u2014 a Nymph undressing for the Bath.

He un dertook to model my hand, and a most disagreeable operation I found it. At Terraciani's we saw busts and figures of Lord Abercorn's children ; but we had no time to undertake any thing. He shewed us a Flora just finished for Baron Rothschild, at Naples. Bien Aimee, another Italian sculptor, had some very admirable statues ; and here I bought some marble slabs for tables.

Our departure from Rome being fixed, the last day was a busy one. I did not attempt to enter St. Peter's on Palm Sunday, feeling weak and un equal to the exertion, consequently I lost a very interesting and imposing spectacle ; the procession of the Pope and the Cardinals, and the raising and blessing of the palms, take place on this occasion. Early on Monday morning we went to the Tor- Ionia Palace. It is to be finished in three or four years, and tAA'0 hundred workmen are constantly employed.

The third, the highest and last floor, was destined for the occupation of the family, who certainly do not appear to under stand the luxury of comfort, however much they may enjoy the advantage of wealth. Here Ave were first shown a beautiful little Gothic chapel, painted and gilt, and really a perfect gem.

The Corsini chapel contains much fine sculpture, several columns of verde antique, and a porphyry tomb of Agrippa, found in the Pantheon.

We saw the Pantheon, v\\'hich is the oldest church in Rome, and is ill kept and in a dilapi dated state, stripped, as it now is, of all its finest things. And thus ended our sight-seeing in Rome, which we prepared to leave next day, Tuesday, 6th, after a brief but most interesting residence of only ten days. We left Rome by the Piazza del Popolo, the finest entrance into the Holy City. Our first day was to Viterbo ; though only six posts and a half, we were nearly eleven hours toiling at it ; but in the Roman States every thing proves bad govern ment; and bad roads, bad horses, bad, insolent, postillions delayed us at every stage, while the cheating about the number of horses was quite unbearable.

But, although he declared Ave were right, and had been grossly cheated, the only change effected was that eight horses were attached, and we were expected to pay for only six.

We found it impossible to make the jour ney in less than four days, and we slept the last night at a wretched inn, at a small place called St. Chirico. I sliould not advise any one to follow our example. From Sienna to Florence, the road lies through a beautiful country ; the vine seems to flourish and to receive great care and cultivation.

Notwith standing, hoAvever, the shortness of our stay, and the multiplicity of his engagements, I succeeded in prevailing upon him to undertake a bust of my son, in which he succeeded with his usual skill.

I had always heard of Lisbon as a detestable residence, but the reality far surpassed my anticipations; the smell, the disturbances, and discomforts of all sorts, the impossibility of walking, driving, moving, breathing, Avithout having every sense offended, are"], [254, "236 LISBON. very annoying ; and the noise, day and night, pre cludes all rest and sleep. The Black Horse Square is the principal great place of parade, and has a fine equestrian statue of John V. From this place branch three streets, the Gold, the Silver, and the Cloth streets. Certainly the first two ill deserve their names, for the shops that are dignified by the title of jeAvellers' Avould be unworthy of figuring as booths at a fair. The filth and poverty of the people are very striking ; they are a miserable, decayed-looking population. The soldiers seen here and there give but an indifferent idea of what the troops must be at present : wliile ruins, heaps of rubbish and un finished buildings, attest the want of energy and slothful nature of the people. Nothing is completed \u2014 nothing is cleared aAvay. On one side, you see the mischief done by the earthquake ; on the other, the effects of the great fire; and, though years have rolled over the scene of destruction, the confusion remains the same. In some places, fine trottoirs have been made.

Tuesday, the 24th, being the anniversary of Don Pedro's death, high mass Avas performed at the Se, or great cathedral, and we were anxious to assist at the ceremony. We had brought letters for se veral people, and, among others, for the Duke de Terceira, who kindly came to us and offered his carriage, for which we Avere most grateful. It was an English chariot, drawn by two mules ; and, on arriving at the church, we found that places were provided for us near the altar. The archbishop took us into a vault adjoining, and showed us the coffin of Don Pedro, covered with black and gold, having on it the crowns of Portugal and Brazil ; also the catafalque of the ill-fated Prince of Leuch tenberg, aa-Iio Avas, for tAvo months only, the husband of the young queen.

Soon after the queen arrived, and was led into her tribune, which was more like a box at a theatre than a peAV in a church. She was dressed in black, and is very large, notAvithstanding her youth. Her present hus band, Prince Ferdinand of Coburg, is good-looking, fair, and so young that he appears quite boyish. The patriarch, a venerable old man, who, I was told, was the head of the Lusitauian church, was carried by the priests in an arm-chair, and placed opposite the queen. The service commenced ; the music was very good ; about twenty voices were accompanied by an orchestra of violins. This latter instrument is so associated with the idea of a theatre that it ap pears to me particularly ill-suited for a cathedral, Avhere, I think, none but an organ admissible ; though I still prefer the simple and solemn music of the Greek church, where multitudes of voices address their Creator, unaided by any instrument. I observed several dogs literally on the steps of the altar, where they ran about unreproved, nor did their appearance seem to create any surprise. After"], [257, "DUCHESS OF TERCEIRA. 239 the service, the king and queen, and all the great officers and ministers, entered the vault, where they remained about a quarter of an hour. We then went to call on the Duchess de Terceira, and had a hot drive of four miles to a pleasant house on the banks of the Tagus. It was fitted up in the English fashion, and looked deliciously cool, AA'ith its fresh chintzes and nice mats. This resi- dence is, I believe, attached to the duke's situation as Governor of Belem Castle. He is, besides, Master of the Horse to the Queen. He was very kind, and constantly placed his equipages at our disposal. It was arranged that we should dine there the following Saturday. For two days the heat was so oppressive that I remained at home. On the Friday, Sir John Om manney invited us to go on board the Donegal, a large man-of-war, anchored in the Tagus. We ac cepted the invitation, and were much gratified with the inspection.

She is not to be compared with the Britannia, of 120 guns, which had been shown me at Plymouth. The party at the Duke of Terceira's was small, and the dinner long. The conversation was gene rally carried on in Portuguese, though they ad dressed me in French. Nothing could be more amusing than the assemblage of different servants that Avaited at dinner, including, among other varieties, a Moor, and a small boy dressed like an English tiger, in boots and leathers. After a week's residence at Lisbon, the arrival of the English packet without letters for us, and the return of the Braganza from Gibraltar, we determined on making an excursion to Cintra, and accordingly, set out on Sunday afternoon. The baggage was sent on before in a cart, and the tAvo servants in a vehicle something like a cabriolet, high, hung very forward, and equally difficult to mount, descend from, or remain in. Lord L. and I followed in a chariot and four (Avhich sounds very grand), and I had promised myself a comfort able drive. We were informed it would require"], [259, "241 PENIIA VERDE. three hours to accomplish the sixteen miles. My expectations vanished on seeing our machine, which certainly Avas ill-fitted eA'en to contain tAvo per sons, much less make them comfortable. I knoAv not what to compare it to, except a small, hard, ill-made, old arm-chair, covered over, pitched for ward, and placed ATery high ; and into this we scrambled. The pavement and the jolting were beyond all description dreadful. It was impossible to converse ; the noise blunted every sense ; one could neither speak, hear, nor see; and found plenty of employment in the vain endeavour to steady oneself, so as to resist the jolts and jerks. Half way Ave stopped to feed the mules, which seemed to enjoy their bread and wine extremely, and we proceeded with renewed vigour. The face of the country strikes a stranger very much, as does also the mixture of barren and waste land Avith the luxuriance of vegetation. The aloe hedges form a good fence, but their beauty was destroyed by the heat and drought of summer, and they looked curled up like sea-Aveed. We passed several quintas, or villas, that seemed in a R"], [260, "242 CINTRA. fallen, ruinous state; but it appeared to me as if very little exertion would be requisite to make them not only habitable, but enjoyable. As Ave approached Cintra, the great range of craggy mountains became visible, and we could distinctly discover the convent on the top of the highest, called Penha Verde. We found our rooms and dinner ready in a small cottage, belonging to the same English person in whose hotel we lodged at Lisbon. I do not remember any description of Cintra, except Lord Byron's, that at all does justice to its singular beauty. The immense rocks, stones, and barren crags thrown about in wild confusion, the orange groves, the cork forests, the extent of view, the mountains that appear inaccessible, and the cool and quiet retreats, to Avhich people are glad to fly from the noise and heated air of Lisbon \u2014 all are grouped in beauty and harmony. \" Lo!

Here St. Honorius dug his OAvn grave, passing the rest of his days coiled up in it, and endeavouring, as Lord Byron truly says, \" To merit heaven by making earth a hell.\" A poor, lame old Portuguese, covered with rags and dirt, was our cicerone ; and as none of the party spoke his language, we Avere deprived of any information he might have given us. We sat on some rocks, and ate our luncheon ; the clear spring beside us afforded delicious water, and a heavy shower having fallen while we were under shelter, Ave set out again to reach the Penha Verde con vent. When I saAV it at a distance, it appeared to me wholly inaccessible, perched, like an eagle's nest, on the highest pinnacle of a craggy mountain"], [263, "245 PENHA VERDE. overlooking the sea ; and even when, after much winding and climbing, Ave approached, I still doubted the powers of my donkey to carry me there, and the skill of the guide to conduct us. HoAvever, at last Ave reached it, and were reAvarded by one of the most magnificent views imaginable. We waited some time, and when Ave gained ad mittance, entered a chapel, where the fine altar piece of carved white marble formed a strong contrast to the dirty leaden candlesticks placed before it.

The monks have long been banished ; and the building is now filled with workmen, as the king has bought it, is repairing the whole, and means to render it a delightful residence. The suite of rooms command beautiful vieAVS, and might be fitted up Avith the greatest luxury and comfort. In the middle of the building is a little Moorish court, paved in blue and white tiles, and sur rounded by small open arches. We climbed up a little winding stone staircase to the prison. Here ao-ain we gazed on the sea, and the surrounding mountains and plains. I did not add my name to"], [264, "246 queen's palace. the many I saw scrawled on the Avail, and we re-mounted our donkeys, and returned to Cintra. The descent is long, but the road is much better than the one from the Cork convent ; and a magnificent winding approach is now in progress, under the king's direction, who shews the best pos sible taste in restoring this old building ; and his project has the additional merit of giving employ ment to a number of people. Next day, the rain fell heavily, but Ave found a moment of fine Aveather to visit what is called the Queen's Palace ; a most uncouth-looking building, when contemplated from the exterior; part of it being Saracenic, and most of it any style of architec ture the gazer may choose to name it. We had some trouble to gain admittance, and, after ascending a great flight of steps, waited a little time at the door, till a dirty guide presented himself to do the honours. The palace is as miserable within as it is ugly outside. The suite of rooms occupied by the queen is uncomfortable, and badly furnished.

At the top of the building is a billiard room, and this is really pretty and original. The room is square, or nearly so, Avith AvindoAvs on three sides, and the arms of the more illustrious families of Portugal painted in compartments ; the Avails are entirely lined with antique blue and white tiles, formed into fantastic pictures and panels. A small bath-room is arranged in a similar manner ; and Avhile we AA'ere gazing, our guide touched some unseen spring, and the freshest and purest Avater streamed forth on every side. We made a rapid escape into the little court to which this cool re treat opened, and here again the small Moorish fountain began to play. We then went to the Marialva Palace, where the convention of Cintra was signed, and where Lord L. had resided during the Avar. We found the once beautiful lady to whom it now belongs, the Mar chioness de Lourical, and she kindly conducted us through the rooms, till she opened a door, and de sired us to look out. We beheld a most extensive prospect of hill and dale; on one side the Cintra"], [266, "248 MAFRA. mountains, on the other Mafra ; while magnificent groves of orange and citron trees lay at our feet. From hence Ave proceeded to Montserrat, a place created by Mr. Beckford, and said to have been perfectly beautiful, but iioav it is in a sad state of decay and ruin. It is difficult to conceive Iioav such havoc and desolation could have happened in so short a space of time. Next day being allotted for our pilgrimage to Mafra, the packing commenced at an early hour, and at eleven o'clock Ave set out ; some of the party walking, some on donkeys, and some con veyed by the carriages and baggage-cart ; and as there Avas hardly the appearance of a road, and Ave all Avent at a foot's pace, Ave were above five hours accomplishing the three leagues. We passed over hills and through valleys that seemed highly cultivated, and where the dusky green of the olive grounds (looking, as Landor somewhere prettily says, \" like an eternal cloud of dust\"), and the lighter tints of the vineyard, made a striking con trast. Arriving at Mafra, we found rooms prepared for us in a corner of this old palace, but neither"], [267, "THE ESCUR1AL OF PORTUGAL. 249 fire, furniture, nor food ; still, as it was impossible to get on that night to Lisbon, we bivouacked as well as we could, and the servants cooked the pro visions we had brought with us. This enormous pile of building, called the Es curial of Portugal, was founded in the last century by King John V., and is said to be chiefly of marble. It is of surprising size, and has above five thousand Avindows. In the centre is the great church ofthe convent, with a cupola, the whole of which is lined with marble of various colours, grey, Avhite, black, and yelloAV, highly polished, though not perhaps of the finest sort. Being very tired after our jolting, broiling day, we postponed seeing more till the morrow, and, after a frugal repast, retired to rest. This immense edifice is completely destitute of furniture ; nor are there any remains of carving and gilding. There is a great deal of rough mar ble, of various sorts, but the rooms generally are of the rudest and coarsest decoration, if such high sounding title may be given to the whitewashed walls and raftered ceiling of the suites Ave passed"], [268, "250 THE CORK CONVENT. through. The corridors, galleries, and rooms seemed endless, and we were told by the in tendant Avho accompanied us, that a person might walk here for tAvo days, without retracing his steps. There is a great convent within the Avails, and a fine library, 226 feet long, Avith a floor of varie gated marble, a dome, and galleries. Here, it is said, are 60,000 volumes; and though the palace is utterly deserted and uninhabited, for I saw but tAvo old men Avhile there, the books seem in the best state of preservation, and not a vestige of dust or damp was to be found. It is only by Avalking over the roofs, that the colossal size of this vast building can be appre ciated. These are almost flat, and tiled for the purpose of promenading, with steps and balus trades ; and are more like terraces or ramparts than housetops. It is, hoAvever, very sad to see this fine palace, which must have cost so much money, time, and labour, now neglected, deserted, tenantless, and falling into decay. \" This is Avhat ought to have been our fleet /\" once observed a"], [269, "RETURN TO LISBON. 251 Portuguese minister of state, to an English envoy, who was lamenting the profitless expense Avhich this gigantic edifice had occasioned.

A more unpleasant and disagreeable residence than Lisbon can hardly be found. The very air is poi soned by pestilential odours ; the noises never cease by day or by night, and all those that belong to town or country are blended together in dread ful harmony, or rather discord.

I spent a mise rable night, though the sea was not very rough, and after passing Cape St. Vincent, it became quite calm. About two o'clock next day, the fair city of Cadiz appeared in sight, and lovely as it is ahvays described and painted, the reality, for once, equal led one's expectation.

There is no harbour, and there being a great many rocks, Avhich are, someAvhat unpoetically, called the Hogs and the Pigs, we anchored two miles from the town, among several other vessels. Captain Coffin, commanding an English brig-of war, the Trinculo, instantly sent off a boat to offer to land us, after the usual ceremony of being boarded and examined by the health and police officers. A very pretty schooner yacht, the Merlin, lay near, and her boat, with Captain Lyon, came alongside. The consul likeAvise sent his son to as sist us. But the prettiest sight of all, was a most picturesque Spanish pilot boat, gaily painted and ornamented, and with a sail placed across it. On landing and walking up to our lodging, Ave Avere instantly struck with the great contrast to Lisbon, the last being, without exception, the dirtiest and most disgusting town I had ever seen, while Cadiz appears as if just built and freshly painted. Outside the walls, Ave passed stalls filled with the whitest bread, in all shapes and forms, and piles of the"], [275, "CADIZ 257 finest fruit. On entering the town we found the shops shut, being Sunday, but it is impossible to describe the brightness and cleanliness of this lovely place. The cool and narrow streets, the neat trottoirs, the Avhite houses Avith green verandas, and with shutters and balconies painted in the gayest colours, are very striking. Here we found our letters, and we settled ourselves in a clean com fortable lodging kept by an Englishman. The shops in Cadiz are good, particularly for gloves, which are said to surpass the French, and are often richly embroidered in gold, silver, or colours. With the assistance of the Misses Brack enbury, daughters of the Consul, I succeeded in making some purchases of silk, &c, and, leaving a large order for gloves, I bought a mantilla, a costume perfectly necessary while residing in Spain, where a bonnet is never seen, and where the ladies promenade with nothing else to defend their heads from the sun.

We dined there, and found an excellent dinner ; but no sooner had the ladies left the room, than, as I was informed, the cigars appeared. There are no carriages at Cadiz ; the distances are short, the streets narrow, and the trottoirs good. I had an opportunity of ascertaining that walking was perfectly practicable in an hour after a torrent of rain. Our lodging looked into the Alameda, or public Avalk ; and so mild is this climate, that, at eleven o'clock at night, neither cold nor damp was to be felt ; and I was told that the moon made it nearly as light as day, and that it was possible to read small print by it.

In one of the chapels, Ave were shewn a small Murillo ; but it was hung too high, and there was not sufficient light, to judge of it. Having heard that fetes, illuminations, balls, and a bull-fight were announced at Seville, to celebrate the inglorious termination of the war, by Don Carlos's betrayal, we determined on hastening to that inter esting city : and on Wednesday, at eight o'clock in the morning, Mr. Brackenbury drove me down to the water's edge, where we found the Trinculo's boats, which took us on board a steamer called the Peninsula, that professed to make her passage to Seville in ten hours. Here we discovered a large party already in possession, clouds of smoke from the different cigars, and the usual smell of oil so universally used for cooking. The morning was delicious, wind and tide favoured us, and we glided on almost imperceptibly. The country was not pretty, and the banks of the Gua dalquivir flat and marshy, and I should think un healthy. The waters looked dirty and troubled, very different from the azure sea near Cadiz. Within tAvo hours of Seville, we met with a small s 2"], [278, "260 SEVILLE. steamer, into which the passengers and luggage were transferred. The plains on each side seemed to be covered with large droves of oxen. As we approached the city, the Avindings of the river per mitted us noAV and then to catch a glimpse of the fine old Gothic cathedral ; the country improved, groves of orange and lemon trees appeared, mixed Avith pomegranates, aloes, and, here and there, a graceful palm tree. At length we landed at a curious old tower, and the usual delay and trouble took place as to the examination of the baggage. Nothing can be more vexatious or worse managed than this ceremony in Spain. One would have supposed that, as every thing had been searched at Cadiz, the same opera tion might have been dispensed with at Seville ; but, on the contrary, it was more rigorous, and repeated again at the gates of the town, as well as on the pier ; and they actually opened my pillow, to see if, of all things in the world, I had filled it with tobacco, the great object of their jealousy, and my aversion !

Next morning we went to high mass, and to hear a Te Deum in the cathedral, and were not disap pointed in our expectations of the beauty of this ancient edifice. The music was very inferior, but the architecture, the carvings, the marbles, and the old stained glass, are beyond all praise. We walked round after the service, and Avished much to see the famous Murillos ; but the chapels were closed, and, being a fete, we could not get them opened. We visited the tomb of Christopher Co lumbus. On his escutcheon, two vessels are re presented, with the expressive motto, \" To Castile and Leon, Columbus gave another world.\" At night the city was illuminated. A singular custom is observed here; in the large piazza, or"], [280, "262 A CHARACTER. square, in the balcony of the palace, the full-length portraits of the two queens are put under a crim son velvet canopy, and sentinels are placed ; the same is done at the theatre. The pavement here is very inferior to that of Cadiz, and the distances greater ; we procured a carriage, however, to drive about. The theatre is small, and the music bad, the smell of the cigars most oppressive, and the general effect spoiled by the ladies having very unwisely abandoned their own beautiful costume to imitate French fashions. The gallery here is entirely set apart for ladies, and it seemed crowded. Men are forbidden to ap proach this sanctuary ; and, while we were at Se ville, much scandal Avas caused by the appearance of two Englishmen, who, in all innocence and igno rance, wandered up, and, unchecked by the usual sentinel, who happened to be absent, transgressed the rule, and were accordingly shown up in the neAvspapers next day.

Returning, \\Are passed by the dome of the cathedral, which, being illuminated to the top, had a brilliant effect. Friday, 11th, being the day of the bull-fight, we secured two balconies, and at three o'clock pro ceeded there ; unfortunately, we were rather late, and the ceremony had commenced ; one bull was already struggling in the agonies of death. The amphitheatre is large, and, I was told, had held thirteen or fourteen thousand persons, at four o'clock in the morning, when the mob was admit ted without payment, to see the bulls which AA'ere driven in from the neighbouring plains. One man had been killed that morning, or, as an American called it, \" a human had been used up.\" The go vernor's box, containing several persons in uniform, was situated in the middle of the building. The"], [282, "264 BULL-FIGHT AT SEVILLE. bulls were not as furious or as strong as I expected, and the horses were most wretched. The dresses of the Picadors and the Matador are variegated and tasteful ; the latter is the person who kills the animal, and is the only one privileged to bear a scarlet flag. There is much interest and excitement in this exhibition ; and, hoAvever great the disgust and horror one must feel at the cruelty and brutality exhibited, it is almost impossible to withdraw one's eyes from the scene before them. It is, in fact, a strange and painful fascination. One of the bulls killed three horses in a very short time. There is great dexterity in the way the Banderilleros rush in, and stick ornamented darts into the sides or head of the animal, for the purpose of enraging him. Sometimes these are made to explode with rockets. On one occasion, the bull not being suf- ficiently savage, the people cried out for the dogs, but the cry was disregarded.

In an enormous room, five hundred feet long, we saw, seated at little tables, two thousand nine hun dred women and girls, all employed in making and tying-up cigars. It was the most curious and novel sight I ever beheld ; the noise was deafening, and the smell poisonous, but the scene was one for a painter : all ages were here, though but few pretty faces ; one poor girl, exhausted by fatigue, lay sleeping with her head on the table her companions"], [285, "267 MURILLO. worked round. We were told they came from the neighbouring country, and were paid by the hun dred cigars they tAvisted. We next went to the great hospital in the church, where are the three chefs d'\u0153uvre of Murillo; two are hung so high, and in so bad a light, that it is hardly possible to see their beauty.

We were shown all the treasure ; and there is a surprising quantity of plate, and great riches in jewels and old gold and silver; large candlesticks, vases, cups, chalices, &c, of the finest work, very ancient, and extremely costly. A small and curi ously worked ornament is to be seen there, made of the first gold from the NeAv World, encrusted with unpolished emeralds and sapphires.

On that day in the year it is paraded with great pomp and ceremony through the tOAvn, by men in magnificent dresses. We had projected an expedition to Cordova, but this was discovered to be at that time impracticable, even for gentlemen, and of course utterly impossible for a lady to undertake. The want of inns and all accommodation Avould have added discomfort to danger and difficulty. We therefore gave this up with regret, though we were consoled by being assured we lost nothing in foregoing it, as the old Mosque there was the only thing really worth seeing. It is described as being in a bad state ; as a Moorish relic, it ranks after the Alhambra, and next to the Alcazar at Seville. During the occupation of Cordova by the Moors, Cordova is stated to have contained two hundred thousand houses, nine hundred public baths, and six hun dred mosques. As a great favour, we were allowed to inspect a convent, and the one we selected AA-as the poorest, but a very interesting and extremely ancient one \u2014 that of St. Inez de Coronella.

She in formed us there were tAventy-eight nuns, all of whom Avere very poor, the government having taken their revenues under promise of paying them so much per day, but for twenty months, this had been neglected, and consequently they were in great distress, and lived on charity and the bounty of strangers."], [289, "ST.

The birds sang sAveetly, and the flowers were most fragrant. These appeared to be all the amuse ment and recreation of these poor recluses, who however declared themselves perfectly happy. They were all very old, but we were told there were a few young ones : on this occasion, Iioav - ever, they were locked up. We saw the dor mitory, a long gallery fitted up with little white beds ; and the refectory, with a pulpit from Avhich one of the sisterhood reads during the repast. They seemed delighted with our visit, asked the most silly and childish questions, and repeated the same words a dozen times over. Every thing was in a state of extreme and careful cleanliness, not an atom of dust or dirt was visible, and their dress, though of the coarsest materials, AA'as equally neat, composed of a purple stuff gown, and thick black veil. A scourge and rosary hung from the girdle, and a medallion of their patroness was suspended by a ribbon round the neck. One old nun, after"], [290, "272 SEVILLE. some secret negociation, with the aid of an inter preter, consented to part with hers for four dol lars, and thus I Avas enabled to carry away an interesting remembrance of my visit. Mr. Standish, a rich English gentleman settled in Seville, Avas so good as to give me a concert ; and I Avas also present at another at the \" Lonja,\" a great public room. The music was loud and bad : the president read a speech or oration ; in answer to which not a word Avas said ; and being very tired, and finding the whole thing extremely dull, I went away early. They have in Spain a c urious word to indicate any great fete ; they call it a \" funcion ;\" and they apply the same word to any assemblage of personages of consideration. The day arrived when we were to bid adieu to Seville, where so much is to be seen that is new and strange, that we altogether forgot the incon venience and the privations we endured in being un comfortably accommodated and indifferently pro vided. The flowers here are remarkably beautiful and abundant. Even in this advanced month, I had every day large bouquets of the finest roses,"], [291, "CADIZ 273 myrtle, and a profusion of the sweetest jessamine. The streets are narrow and ill paved, and the houses do not appear to advantage, the best part of them, namely the Patio, or court, being at the back. There, during summer, the ladies hold their tertulias, or evening parties, and, till the month of October, live entirely on the ground floor. We found a great difference in the climate, Seville being much warmer than Cadiz. On Tuesday, the 15th, we returned by the Gua dalquivir, in a small steam-boat, and fortunately escaped sticking in the mud, a very common oc currence in this shallow river. We heard of one vessel which had remained there ten days, and we saw one that seemed to have little chance of moving. Arriving late at Cadiz, we went to dine on board Mr. Bentinck's yacht, the Antelope ; and as the Governor was kind enough to allow the gates of the city to be opened, we landed late, and returned to our inn. Next day being devoted to rest after my fatigues, I went on Thursday on board Captain Lyon's schooner yacht, the Merlin, and saw a race r"], [292, "274 XERES between his boat and that of the Trinculo, com manded by Captain Coffin ; the latter was vic torious. Friday, the 18th, we started very early on an expedition to Xeres. We arrived at the pier just in time to see the steamer depart without us. We therefore hired a Spanish felucca, or small sailing boat, which, as the wind was favourable, took us over to Port St. Mary's in an hour and a half. It is a large town. We found here a very extra ordinary vehicle, a sort of open carriage, to AAdiich six mules were attached ; it had been sent for us by Mr. Gordon, the great Scotch wine mer chant. His two sons in a cabriolet, accompanied by an armed outrider, escorted us. Unfortunately the rain fell in torrents, and prevented us from seeing the country and the vineyards, from which the famous sherry is made. It was too wet to visit the convent in the neighbourhood, but we were most kindly and hospitably received by Mr. Gordon. The cellars where his wine is kept are built on the dimensions of the cathedral at Seville, and in them are placed between four and five"], [293, "CADIZ 275 thousand butts of sherry, varying in price, from \u00a330 to \u00a3200 each. At this place I was fortunate enough to meet with a very curious fan, which I selected from se veral old ones brought me to look at. After dinner, we were escorted back to Port St. Mary's by Mr. Gordon's sons, and being driven at a wonderful pace, we accomplished the ten miles much under the hour. Xeres is a large rich toAvn, with 45,000 inhabitants. I learned from Mr. Gordon that my father had once spent a year here. Land is of very great value ; an acre, highly cultivated, may produce \u00a3250 a-year; and each olive tree is calculated at about 12s. annually.

On the morning of the 19th, we prepared to take our departure from Cadiz for Tangiers. The sea was rough, the yachts lay far out, and the little boat danced on the Avater till I became ex- tremely nervous. At last, I was deposited safely on board the Antelope ; and the Xarifa, with Lord and Lady Wilton, coming into the bay, they paid me a visit. They advised delay, and wanted us to remain till they returned from Seville. We were, hoAvever, unwilling to lose time, and our friends, Mr. Bentinck and Captain Lyon, deciding for us, we weighed anchor, and aAvay we Avent. We had hardly left the bay, when the Aveather changed ; rain, fog, and haze, with tremendous sea and swell, came on ; and the gay party that was"], [298, "280 TANGIERS. to meet at dinner at six o'clock was completely broken up. Blue lights were burnt, that we might keep near the Merlin, but, at last, we lost her in the dark. As night advanced, the pitching in creased, and Lord L. proposed returning to Cadiz ; but this Mr. Bentinck decidedly negatived ; and, after a dreadful night of suffering and misery, we made the African coast; and, after tAventy-four hours from Cadiz, anchored in Tangiers bay. The Merlin soon folloAved ; and, as there was a great deal of rolling, notwithstanding a change of weather, it was settled that I should land, the English consul, Mr. Drummond Hay, having kindly offered to give me a room in his house. The boat shot on the sand, and tAvo old, barelegged, tur baned Arabs, having Avaded through the water, and carried me out on a chair, deposited me on a donkey, and we set off. Arriving first at the consul's house, we proceeded to see the fair on a hill outside the town. The scene was most curious and interest ing.

The reason they gave Avas, that the angel of death was expecting, and, if made to wait long, would return to heaven Avithout the deceased. Not a Christian was to be seen ; but on all sides, Jews and Moors, the latter having ahvays the long lock of hair by which they are to be drawn or pulled into paradise. Some unfortunate, half naked, miserable beings that I saw huddled up to gether, I was told were considered as saints, be cause they were out of their mind. We passed a beautiful old Moorish mosque, which was open, and we peeped in ; some tall forms Avrapped in their haicks were visible, but it is death for a Christian to enter therein. We also"], [300, "282 TANGIERS. passed by a bazaar for tobacco and other merchan dize. It is not safe for strangers to go about without a guard, as the Moors believe that the murder of a Christian is a step toAvards heaven. They never do harm to a cat, as they consider them evil spirits, and as having the means of revenge ; and they are, consequently, to be seen in great numbers. The Consul's son killed fifty in one day, and, looking over the tops of the houses, which are quite flat without chimneys, I saw a prodigious number. At length vA-e arrived at the top of the hill, on the side of which several tents Avere pitched, and a more curious scene can hardly be conceived. We were much struck with the wildness and novelty of these strange beings, some of whom were huddled up in groupes, some marching about in solitary state. Here were crowds of Jews, oxen, asses, and camels \u2014 some of the latter were kneeling, others heavily laden with fruit, and most vicious brutes they seemed. Not a female was to be seen, ex cept, now and then, some frightful old woman, very closely and most unnecessarily veiled.

They do not alloAV them to be taken out of the country. The climate is perfectly charming. We found ourselves near the end of October, with a bluer sky, a Avarmer air, a brighter sun than Ave had known during even the dog-days in England, sur rounded by the richest vegetation, and almost all the finest tropical plants. We saw every where growing in wild luxuriance the floAvers and shrubs we had hitherto knoAvn only as nurselings of a hothouse.

The geranium hedges, the beds of tuberoses, the pepper tree \u2014 a most beautiful and graceful plant \u2014 the tobacco, the palm-tree, were all to be found here, with many others ; while, in the open country, the aloes, and the cactus or prickly pear, asto-"], [302, "284 TANGIERS. nished us by their wonderful size. The grapes are the finest in the Avorld, being the size of small eggs, and of excellent flavour. We returned by another road, passing a manu factory of the famous morocco leather, and re entered the walls of the town : the gates are closed at sunset, and during the hours of prayer. The Consul was extremely hospitable in re ceiving all the party at dinner, and we found his family most amiable and agreeable. His house was very comfortable, with a large wooden balcony overhanging the garden, and looking over the beau tiful bay, Avithout taking in any of the horrors of the town. I was told that the vegetation had suffered much from a tremendous visitation of locusts that had blighted and destroyed every thing, and that it was only just beginning to recover. They had been obliged to keep an immense number of men employed in sweeping the walls and gar dens to prevent their coming into the house. It was said the poor people ate them, and that they tasted like shrimps : I also heard that a lion had come doAvn among them some years ago, Avhich"], [303, "285 TANGIERS. the natives considered as a presage of the cholera. Being very much fatigued, and the Consul kindly pressing our stay, we determined on remaining another day, and sailing early next morning. Some Moorish merchants brought their stores of haicks, embroidered cushions, slippers, purses, and pocket books. By giving them six dollars of pure gold, you may have a ring made and curiously worked with any name, in Arabic. Of these I ordered several, as remembrances for friends at home \u2014 and directed that some should be engraved AA'ith the word Tangiers. In the evening four Moorish musicians came, and squatted in a half-circle at the farthest end of the room. The first had some indescribable old in- strument with two strings ; the second, a sort of guitar ; the third, who Avas a Jew, played the fiddle ; and the fourth jingled an ancient tambou rine. All sung, or rather hoAvled, and only agreed in one point \u2014 namely, in producing a medley of noise and discord, more barbarous and wild than any exhibition I ever before witnessed. Dr."], [304, "286 TANGIERS. Forbes, (the Englisli physician who accompanied us) Avas much consulted here, and especially by a beautiful JeAvess with Avhom he lodged ; and, on holding out hopes to her of a family after five years' expectation, the husband gratefully embraced him ; and all the toAvn flocked to see the pro phetic Hakim. We were very desirous of an audience of the Basha, who fixed ten o'clock on the Tuesday morning to receive us, thereby compelling us to delay for some hours our departure. At the ap pointed time, the whole party set forth. The gen tlemen proceeded on foot, having made themselves as smart as circumstances would permit. I was mounted on a small white horse, and felt conscious of being a most extraordinary figure ; the Consul having desired that I should put on jeAA'els (as a mark of respect to the Basha), which certainly were ill-suited to my travelling gown and old straw poke-bonnet. We Avere accompanied by an aged fat interpreter, and a beautiful Jewess, in the rich cos tume of her nation ; her black eyelashes and broAvs were deeply dyed ; she wore double ear-rings, and"], [305, "THE BASHA OF TANGIERS. 287 one pair were as thick and as large as Indian bangles or bracelets. Her little feet were bare, AA'ith the exception of red velvet and gold slippers, and even these she was obliged to take off in Moorish pre sence. Passing the mosque with her slippers on, and hearing herself cursed, she darted forward, turned very pale, and then informed us that this malediction Avas in consequence of her not being barefooted while on holy ground. We ascended a very steep hill, on the top of which stands the old Moorish castle. The courts were filled with Arabs and extraordinary-looking beings. After waiting a few minutes, we were ushered into the marble patio, where, AA'ithout attendants, the Basha received us. Three carpets, each less than the one below it, and a folded blanket, formed the seat on which he sat, or rather squatted, holding his feet, and apparently counting his toes. He was wrapped in white muslin and a haick. His turban was white as driven snow ; his eye fine ; his countenance in telligent, and his skin salloAV. A small semicircle of chairs was phiced, to which he pointed, and de-"], [306, "288 TANGIERS. sired us to take possession ; and we were intro duced by the Consul, attended by the interpreter. According to the Eastern fashion of bringing a gift in the hand, as a mark of respect and honour, Ave had understood that an offering to the amount of forty dollars was to be made in the shape of a robe, a turban, or tea and sugar : but this the Basha declined with some little pique, saying, that as the English, in consequence of orders from their government, had declined his presents, he could not receive any from that nation. Some conversation on Eastern politics arose ; and assuredly he did not express flattering opinions as to France. After a little time, a black boy conducted Miss Hay, myself, and the beautiful Jewess, to a garden, where, in a small summer-house, we found the Basha's three wives and two children crouching on the ground. The JeAvess kissed them, and seated herself beside them ; and two chairs were placed for us, the black boy, Hadjee, standing by. Any thing so hideous as these ladies I never beheld. We were told that the Basha Avas very proud,"], [307, "289 LADIES OF TANGIERS. and had chosen his Avives more with regard to high birth than good looks. The first was a most frightful old woman, with a salloAV skin, half closed eyes, and a figure that could be compared to nothing but a badly-made feather-bed ; the second was painted like a savage, and equally shapeless ; the third was black, and adorned with silver anclets and bracelets. It was really a daring figure of speech to call the children human. All were dressed in coarse muslin, and wore coloured glass beads. Their manners were bold, and their questions childish and absurd. There was a feeling of humi liation at witnessing such utter degradation of one's own species. The JeAvess translated Avhat they said into Spanish, and Miss Hay explained it to me. They inquired our Christian names, and whether we were married ; they asked Miss Hay whether she did not wish for this event, and were told it was likely to take place soon. They in quired how many children I had, and how many boys \u2014 and said it was very wrong for a married woman to sheAv her hair. After many mutual civil speeches, we rose to U"], [308, "290 GIBRALTAR. depart, but were invited to remain, that they might still have the pleasure of looking at us, and the old lady, tuning her guitar, began to sing, what they told us was a pathetic love-romance, but what appeared to us most repulsive discord. They said they had expected that we should remain till sun set. I replied they could see the ships in the bay waiting to carry us aAvay, and that, if I delayed, we should be out all night, and, perhaps, ship wrecked ; besides, my husband would be very angry with me for making him wait. The black boy then conducted us, through some strange old corridors and stairs, to the top of the house, to see the prospect ; and here we met the basha, who cursed the poor Jewess for having dared to put on her slippers in his house. We then took our leave, and descended to the AA'aterside, AA'here, after seeing some cavalry exer cised, and bidding adieu to our kind and hospitable friends, we embarked, and after less than four hours' sail, anchored off Gibraltar. The Merlin and the Antelope were moored by the New Mole, and Ave landed, and Avere most kindly received by"], [309, "291 GIBRALTAR. the Governor, Sir Alexander Woodford, who had sent his carriage for us. We found rooms prepared for us at the Eng lish club-house, and our children all well. The Braganza steamer came in soon after us, and we had the pleasure of receiving a large packet of letters. On the folloAving day we called on Lady Woodford, and found Prince Henry of Orange ; a revieAV was fixed for ten o'clock the following day, and a great dinner at the Governor's after wards. We then went on board the Merlin, AA'here we had a very merry party at dinner. The garrison now consists of 2,500 men ; the population of the town is said to be about 14,000. The weather was fine, the ground chosen was beau tiful, and the scene gay and pretty ; although an infantry review of a small number of men is rather a dull exhibition. The blue Mediterranean lay before us, and the stupendous Rock tOAvered above. We had a large dinner-party in the evening at the Governor's, whose delightful house was un fortunately under repair.

Some curious arms, French clocks, &c. were in other parts of the room. The Jew merchant, Mr. Levi, was the interpreter. Little tables, a foot high, were brought in, and he and an old Moor sat down to make tea, one in the English, the other in the Moorish fashion. Ac cording to the latter, the sugar is put in the tea pot, and I found it excellent, even without milk. A large boAvl of cream, piles of cakes, dates, and sugared almonds, were brought in on large brass waiters. The Basha is old and grey-headed, his appearance venerable, and his manner courteous. Inquiries were made after the Sultan ; and, in return, offers of service, and the town placed at our disposal. We were then shewn over the house, which is old and very curious, with tiled stairs and Avails, and elaborate ceilings, in the style of the Alcazar at Seville. In the recess of a marble patio, or court, sat the Basha's wife ; and near her, the wife of his eldest son, a little creature of sixteen, who had been married five years. Her face was flat and like a Calmuck's, but her dark eyes and long"], [321, "TETUAN. 303 lashes were beautiful, and she had taken some pains to deepen the colour by black dye. Round the court, we saAV cages Avith singing birds sus pended in every direction. The Basha's second son conducted us over the palace. Five or six black girls laughed immoderately at my appearance. One held in her arms a child, which I discovered to belong to the young bride above described ; but it appeared to be considered as general property, and, I thought, ran some risk of suffocation from kissing and kindness. From the roof of the house, we overlooked the toAvn and surrounding country, the view of which was very extensive. We then returned to take leave of the Basha, and were conducted over a large unin habited house, or palace, of the Sultan's. In the garden, one of the young men picked some jes samine, and gallantly presented the bouquet to me. We ate some excellent grapes of a peculiar form and long shape, called ladies' fingers. Lastly, we were conducted to the stables, AA'here a few miserable horses stood tethered, without straAV or manger, and one of these unfortunate animals had"], [322, "304 GIBRALTAR. had his tail shaved, by way of adding to his beauty. We were informed that we ought to leave forty dollars with the black boy, as a present to the Basha, to be distributed among his attendants. We afterwards heard he had only given them ten, and buried the remaining thirty. Our next visit was to the family of Levi, where we were shown some splendid Jewish dresses. The sash worn by the women is particularly mag nificent ; it is above three yards long, and richly woven in gold. I bought some velvet-embroidered pocket-books from some of the merchants, whom I found as anxious to cheat as their brethren at Tangiers; however, I succeeded in getting these things for exactly half the price asked at Gib raltar. November 3rd. \u2014 The weather having cleared and the yachts having returned to their anchorage, we took leave of our hospitable host and hostess, Mr. and Mrs. Butler.

They"], [323, "305 MALAGA. have a fine family of nine children. The daugh ters never stir out of the house ; not a teacher is to be had, nor can they speak any language but Spanish. We rode back, found the boats on the beach, and embarked. The wind was fair and the water smooth to the Almeira point. It became then rather rough on crossing the straits. We arrived at Gibraltar in the evening, and after some little difficulty in getting pratique, landed at the New Mole. The Club House Hotel Avas very full ; however, we succeeded in getting rooms, and remained there for three days to receive and answer our letters. We dined with the Governor, and on Thursday the 7th, went on board the Antelope, which, with the Merlin, sailed for Malaga. The day Avas so calm that our progress was scarcely perceptible ; but after a night that, in England, Avould have been thought warm and fine, even in July, AA'e anchored close to the Mole at Malaga. Soon after, the English Consul came on board, and announced that Lord and Lady Wilton x"], [324, "306 MALAGA. not only had not started, but had delayed their journey that Ave might all travel to Granada to gether, as they had secured the escort, and we had ordered the carriages. We doubted at the time the wisdom of this scheme, as we suspected the larger the party the worse the accommodation would be ; however, we agreed to the proposal, and accordingly, every thing was arranged for setting out the next day. We landed and walked about the town. They make here some very spirited figures in clay, represent ing the various national costumes and amusements. I desired that an entire bull-fight might be made for me and sent to England. The cathedral un fortunately was closed, and, to my regret, I did not see it, as it is very handsome, though modern. We dined on board the Xarifa, and next morn ing, Saturday, November 9th, our procession set forth. We had a large English coach with six mules, an omnibus, and a baggage-cart, each with the same number, laden mules, riding-horses, muleteers, servants, and an escort of lancers with a corporal ; so that altogether, the long string of"], [325, "307 EL COLMENOR. equipages and imposing number of people, (between thirty and forty) made us hope to be tolerably se cure from robbers. We were told rather an absurd story of the coach and horses of a plebeian meeting the car riage and mules of an aristocrat ; much confusion arose as to precedence, the mules declining to yield the pas to the horses belonging to an infe rior master; at last, the coachmen unharnessed the animals, and (as the story goes) the carriages remained in the street, until Time, by annihilating them, settled the question of precedency, or rather, left it exactly as it was. The torrent of rain in which our journey com menced increased. The ascent of the mountains was severe, the roads bad, the baggage could not advance, and altogether our progress AA'as so un propitious, that Ave were glad to stop at a hovel in a wretched village, called, I believe, El Colmenor. There were not two rooms, for one was only a small loft, and the Avhole place was filled with people. The Alcalde, or judge, however, came, and soon cleared it. In this uncomfortable abode x 2"], [326, "308 LOJA Ave passed the night, thankful for shelter from the Avind and rain. Next morning early Ave set out ; and, after breakfasting at the Venta, tAvo leagues on, (where we ought to have slept, if the mules had not been utterly exhausted by the fatigue and bad Aveather of the preceding day,) Ave proceeded to Loja, a considerable town, about half Avay to Granada. Here Ave found a very good posada, and spent the night; starting next morning at six o'clock, in the hope of reaching Granada the same day. The scenery here was beautiful, but the roads or rather tracks were almost impassable, and the rain continued unabated. We toiled on for many weary miles, till at seven o'clock in the evening the mules could proceed no farther, though we had only ac complished half of our intended journey. We re monstrated with the muleteers, and much discus sion arose ; but the dreadful state of the roads, the complete exhaustion of the animals, and the warn ings of robbery (said to have been frequent in an olive wood which we had to pass) compelled the party to submit to necessity, and we bivouacked at a farm of the Duke of Wellington's."], [327, "AL ACHAT. 309 It is hardly possible to describe how wearying and fatiguing a journey may be rendered by accidental circumstances, and very bad weather. Eighty miles in England, the task of an easy day, became, in Spain, hard work for four ; and on an average, we advanced little beyond one mile and a half in an hour, alloAving for the various delays of muleteers and mules, the latter falling, and waiting to be dragged up by the former ; and the harness constantly breaking and to be repaired, besides innumerable other accidents. Two of our escort rode on to examine the country, and took one man prisoner, who was armed, and skulking behind a hedge ; he endea voured to escape, but failed. The diligence pas sing soon after, explained what his plans had been. It appeared that the house we were in at Al Achat was not an inn.

Close adjoining is the Ioav door of the Moorish"], [332, "314 WASHINGTON IRVING. palace, which we entered, and found ourselves in one ofthe little courts so often described,but so little capable of being imagined beforehand. I know not how other travellers are affected by what they see : I only know for myself, that I came with an eager imagination. From childhood the idea of the Al hambra had been to me (as Washington Irving so truly says) \" what Mecca is to the Moslem.\" I had read and treasured its romances, gazed on its pic tures, and dreamed and fancied the scene, until I almost believed myself one of the heroines of yore. I had seen in my mind's eye the thickets of roses and the groves of myrtle, and, though I came in November, and found the sear and yellow leaf, I almost expected to see the Lindoraxas and Zo raydas appear. In short, I arrived in a breathless state of excitement, with my spirits and imagina tion so over-wrought that I almost felt that even the reality would be disappointment. The weather was bright, clear, and sunny, as it ever is, even in winter, in this glorious southern clime. We were fortunate in having the well-known guide, Mateo Ximenes, \" a son of the Alhambra.\""], [333, "LORD PORCHESTER. 315 He led my mule, and, having helped me to dis mount, watched my face to see the impression the first vieAV would make upon me. I hope he was gratified, for, if my countenance at all expressed my feelings, he could not mistake the admiration and surprise with which I gazed on the enchant ing scene. This was the court of the Alberca; it was paved with marble, and in the centre was an immense fish-pond, or reservoir, one hundred and thirty feet in length, by thirty in breadth, bor dered by a trelliswork of roses. It opens through a Moorish arch, into the Court of Lions, which is opposite to the Hall of the Abencerrages. Lord Porchester admires Florian's description of this beautiful place, and, perhaps, he is most exact in the dimensions and proportions he gives. But Washington Irving conveys to my mind the most poetic and touching idea of the Alhambra. He lived in, and appears to me to have lived on, its loveliness ; at least, no one seems to have felt it in his inmost soul as he has done. He says, speaking of the renowned Court of Lions : \u2014 \" There is no part of the edifice that gives a"], [334, "316 COURT OF LIONS. more complete idea of its original beauty and mag nificence than this ; for none has suffered so little from the ravages of time. In the centre stands the fountain famous iu song and story. The alabaster basins still shed their diamond drops, and the tAvelve lions which support them cast forth their crystal streams, as in the days of Boabdil. The court is laid out in floAver-beds, and surrounded by light Arabian arcades of open filagree work, sup ported by slender pillars of white marble. The architecture, like that of all the other parts of the palace, is characterised by elegance rather than grandeur; bespeaking a delicate and graceful taste, and a disposition to indolent enjoyment. When one looks upon the fairy tracery of the pe ristyles, and the apparently fragile fretwork of the walls, it is difficult to believe that so much has survived the wear and tear of centuries, the shocks of earthquakes, the violence of war, and the quiet, though no less baneful pilferings of the tasteful traveller. It is almost sufficient to excuse the po pular tradition, that the Avhole is protected by a magic charm.\""], [335, "317 HALL OF THE TWO SISTERS. Here I gathered a branch of myrtle, to bring away as a remembrance; and Mateo, observing this, brought me a beautiful carnation, saying, \"El unico, Sefiora.\" The Governor presented me with a large tuberose, which was deliriously fragrant. On one side of the Court of Lions is the Hall of the Two Sisters, so called from two large slabs of marble in the pavement. The glazed and highly polished tiles are in a perfect state. The ceil ings are of surpassing beauty; and the labour, taste, ingenuity, and patience of the Moors, are here displayed in every form. The general state of preservation is surprising, and, here and there, remains of the brilliant colouring are seen, such as the lapis lazuli, or Tyrian blue, of which ancient secret these people alone possessed the knoAvledge ; bright scarlet, and, occasionally, patches of gold, relieving the various tints. On the other side of the Court of Lions is the Hall of the Abencerrages. Mateo pointed out the place of the massacre, and the indelible stains of blood. We proceeded to the Ambassador's hall, which is very grand. Here Columbus was received in state on his return from his voyage."], [336, "318 THE ALHAMBRA. The ceiling is of cedar, inlaid with mother-o' pearl, enriched with gilding, painting, and the brightest colours. \" Oh ! given to song, and revelry, and light, Alhambra's halls were beautiful that night ; Her cedar roof, Avith precious pearl inlaid, Her walls transparent, seem'd of crystal made.1 Certainly the Alhambra is one of the few ob jects in the world which do not disappoint even highfloAvn and ovenvrought expectations ; and yet it is impossible to describe its beauty or its charm. It is not large, not magnificent, but it is unique. The perfection of its proportions, the lightness of its architecture, the transparency of its fretAvork, must be seen to be duly appreciated ; and when among the small, low, Moorish arches you see such elaborate work and delicate tracery, you marvel how any thing so fragile has lived through centuries. It is true that some writers have felt and done partial justice to the beauty, the poetry, the romance of the whole ; but I doubt whether any author or painter has ever succeeded in placing the scene before the comprehension of any one who has not gazed on the reality ; at least, I feel that no description can do it justice."], [337, "THE ALHAMBRA. 319 The traveller wanders through the courts and halls, sighing that one cannot \"From the long cheerless night of ages raise The festive image of those splendid days. And bid Alhambra echo to the strain Her mouldering walls shall never hear again.\" We proceeded to the Tocador, or Queen's dressing room, which commands an enchanting view. Its frescoes however are grievously defaced by bar barous hands, who have registered in rude charac ters their names, unknown to fame. It is impossible adequately to express one's ad miration of this fairy palace, graceful, lovely, singular, and placed in so unrivalled a position. It is sufficiently high to look doAvn on Granada and Santa Fe, and over the whole of the Vega, or plain, which is literally a garden of sixty miles long, and in some places thirty wide, marked by the richest soil and the finest cultivation, and irri gated by numerous watercourses.

But the magnificent background Avhich ren ders the scenery of Granada so picturesque, must be wanting in the Eastern picture. The fine range of mountains, or Sierra Nevada, is crowned even in the dog-days with continual snow ; and yet, during the broiling heat of summer, this ap pears so near, that it seems only requisite to put out one's hand to reach the dazzling surface. We were all worn and harassed with our jour ney and the hardships we had undergone ; but so Avell Avere Ave repaid by Avhat we saw, that not one of the party regretted the past, but all agreed they were amply reAvarded. It must also be borne in mind that AA'e saw this spot under every dis advantage of season, in the middle of November, with a clear frost, and clad in autumnal tints, and not in the month of May, Avith its thickets of roses and myrtle, and its groves of orange and citron, when it must indeed be an earthly paradise.

The great cathedral of Granada is very fine ; it is comparatively modern, of Grecian architecture, and profusely decorated in white and gold. The dome is of peculiar richness, and the painted glass extremely ancient. The chapels are curious ; and here lie the remains of Ferdinand and Isabella, in two marble tombs of the most elaborate and highly wrought sculpture. The Alameda, or public walk, is cheerful and pretty, and in its shades one may forget the neigh bourhood of a great town. The inn was as dirty as a Spanish posada can be ; the corridors were filled with the muleteers and guides, who literally bivouacked in them, huddled over braseros filled with charcoal. The weather was seasonable, a fine clear frost ; but the want of fireplaces in every room was severely felt. The Governor of the town, General Mier, was very attentive to us, and called several times; but, unfortunately, as he spoke nothing A"], [340, "322 CONVENT NEAR GRANADA. but Spanish, we were unable to have much con versation with him. We went to an old Carthusian convent, about two miles from Granada, and were greatly struck with the magnificent chapel belonging to it. The fine Murillos that once adorned the walls were carried off by the French, avIio, hoAvever, affected to replace them by copies. The sacristy is beau tiful. The marbles are of the country, and take the finest polish, having the appearance of agate. The drawers for the priest's vestments, and the doors, are of the most costly Avork, red tortoise shell inlaid with ivory and silver, so far surpassing the most gorgeous cabinets and armoires I had ever seen, that it was difficult to look without eiiA'ying. There had been a splendid silver shrine for the Host, equal if not superior to the one at Seville, but it had been taken a\\vay by the French, and was replaced by one made in painted wood. The whole of the building was in the highest state of preservation ; the architecture Grecian, and it had probably been built above three hundred years. Nothing could be finer"], [341, "THE GENERALIFFE. 323 than the elaborate stucco-work of the walls and ceilings. The Zacatin, an old street filled with shops, is curious ; narrow as an alley, no carriages can enter, and all the wares are displayed outside of the shops. In Granada, as in all Spanish towns, the SAveetmeats, preserved fruits, and bons-bons are excellent, and there is a great display of baskets of sugar-candy, temples of barley-sugar, and other confectionary. We devoted a day to wandering over the hills and gardens of the Generaliffe. This is a sort of second Alhambra, situated higher than the first, and was the abode of the Moorish sovereigns, whenever the courts of the former failed to offer a cool retreat. Here they repaired during the burn ing heats of summer to inhale the fresh breezes from the Sierra Nevada. Our friend Mateo guided us to the top of the building, from whence the view was magnificent. We saw the plain of the Vega, watered by the Xenil and the Daro, and gazed on the fair city beloAv. In the Daro are Y 2"], [342, "324 MOTRIL. said to be found particles of gold; and in the Xenil, of silver. We wandered through the gardens and trelliced arcades ; Mateo presented me with a large bouquet, and some bunches of delicious grapes. I explained to him that I Avanted some more lasting memorial of the Generaliffe ; and, as we passed through one of the courts where the finest and largest cy presses greAV, he drew out his knife and cut off some pieces of scented Avood, Avhich I carried aAvay. On Sunday, 1 7th, we left Granada, and having determined not to return by Malaga, we dismissed the carriages, carts, &c, and putting the luggage on mules, took the road to Motril, the nearest sea point, where Lord Wilton's and Mr. Bentinck's yachts were to meet us. We had been informed that a fine new chaussee had been made by the convicts, and we saw here and there some of this work ; but after the first four leagues, nothing of the sort was visible. The day was lovely, the scenery magnificent, and the heat excessive, though we looked on the snoAvy top of the Sierra.

Next morning, Ave again set off on horseback. The sce nery now became wilder; and, at last, we entered the mountain pass, and lost all sign of human habitation. The ascent and descent over broken rocks Avithout a vestige of a path made me so nervous that I was glad to exchange my fine black horse, with a long floAving mane and tail, for a humble white donkey. We crossed tbe rocky lied of a river, and continued"], [344, "326 PICTURESQUE SCENERY. winding along our mountain track. We did not meet a creature ; indeed, the path was so narrow that, excepting here and there, in some places there was not room for another to pass. The air was perfumed with rosemary, wild lavender, and thyme ; the sun was scorching, and the heat exces sive, but the scenery was magnificent. Our escort of lancers accompanied us, two riding on in ad vance for fear of any ambuscade, while the others remained in the rear to bring up the baggage, which was divided among twelve or fourteen mules. The English Consul, Mr. Mark, our guide Manuel (so well known to all visitors to Malaga), and our muleteers, added to our already large party of servants, formed a long train, and it was curious to look back and mark it winding round, and up and down, these mountainous and craggy paths. From Granada to Motril is eleven leagues, or forty-four miles. At length, we reached a river with a rapid current. Here we found men pre pared to protect us, should the stream prove too strong for our beasts, which they guided.

I should have men tioned that we had already discovered that, in this liberal country, our best plan was to apply to the judge, or alcalde, who was all-powerful, and made no ceremony of clearing a venta or even a private house, by immediate or forcible ejectment. At one place, El Colmenor, he had come to our assistance unasked, and, in a feAv minutes, had turned out every body out of the kitchen, and every mule out of the stable; kicking and cuffing all Avho came in his way, and knocking doAvn any individual who wore a hat in his pre sence.

We were, however, assured that there was no cause for alarm, and after a most comfortless night, we were truly thankful when daylight came, and though the heavy sea still rolled, the wind moderated. Such, hoAvever, is the caprice of the tideless Mediteranean, and such the uncertainty of the winds here, which appear to blow sometimes from every point of the compass in rapid succession, and then cease entirely, that we had the mortification and disappointment of pas sing the day becalmed, about twenty miles from Barcelona. The trysail was taken down and the mainsail set ; in doing which the main boom got adrift, and was very nearly sprung, and a more dis agreeable effect than this produced in the motion of the vessel to those beloAv cannot be imagined.

We lay-to that night close to Barcelona, and got into the harbour early on Saturday morning, the 30th. The Consul, Mr. Annesley, an Irish gen tleman, married to a Prussian lady, Mademoiselle Brockhausen, came on board, and offered his ser vices. He told us there had been a severe storm, that chimneys had been bloAvn doAvn, houses un roofed, aud much damage done in the port ; and that at Tarragona H. M.S. the Tribune, and thirty tAvo other vessels, had been driven on shore. Barcelona is a large city, with a noble and spa cious harbour, fine ramparts, and a beautiful Alameda. The great fortress of Montjuic, on the high hill on the north entrance to the bay, is ex tremely picturesque. Many handsome stone houses were building in Avhat is called the new town, and there appeared more traffic and commerce than Ave had observed in any other place in Spain ; it is in deed only second to Madrid. The governor of the city and the governor of the fort called on us ; and, after some difficulty, we were alloAved to land our things, without the usual ceremony of having them unpacked on the pier, for the edification of z"], [356, "338 BARCELONA. all the idlers usually collected there. We had much trouble in procuring a lodging, and at last suc ceeded in getting some wretched rooms up three pair of stairs at the posada \" de las Quatro Naciones.\" The cold Avas noAV excessive, and there were no fireplaces or means of warming our selves, but by brasieros, which are extremely op pressive and uiiAvholesome. Tavo days after, the Xarifa came in. Lord and Lady Wilton had been residing on shore at Valencia during the gale, and escaped it. They described the toAvn as attractive, and its manufac tories of tiles und damasks as well worth seeing. Provisions were scarce and dear at Barcelona ; thirty thousand unfortunate people driven in from the mountains had increased the population ; and although numbers were sent off daily to the army, the country was described as being in such a state, that the governor dared not stir out of the gates without a strong escort. We re mained here a week, much interested, and very AA'ell amused.

The Spanish ladies have committed a great error in abandoning their oavii beautiful costume, for second rate French and English fashions. There is a long street here composed of jeAvellers' shops. I was greatly struck Avith the earrings made for the peasantry ; they are heavy and sliOAvy, enriched with stones, and cost from twenty to fifty pounds. On my expressing my astonishment at their being able to purchase such expensive orna ments, I was told that they were extremely rich on this northern coast, and especially about the Bay of Rosas ; which we regretted excessively that want of time and the lateness of the season prevented our seeing. The black satin in this town is considered excel lent. There is also a great manufactory for thread stockings, and silver plate is cheap, and prettily wrought. The bad weather continuing, filled the harbour Avith ships, for none of the vessels could put to sea, and many came in, so that the situa tion of the yachts was by no means without anxi-"], [358, "340 MARSEILLES. ety : however, fortunately our fears were without cause, for no accident occurred. Two French vessels Avere here, La Surprise and La Fleche, and their captains visited and admired, perhaps envied, the yachts. On Saturday, 7th, Ave sailed ; the Xarifa having taken her departure on the preceding Thursday. We were most fortunate in having fine weather and a fair wind. We soon got round the Cape ; and, after tAventy six hours' run from Barcelona, made the French land and the Plania lighthouse, but un fortunately too late to get into Marseilles harbour till daylight. Our usual ill luck, however, did not desert us. No sooner had it been decided that we must lie-to till morning, than the weather, which had been thickening all around, got worse. Squalls with rain and a heavy sea made the night very dis agreeable, and we were not sorry next day to find ourselves anchored among thirteen hundred vessels in this busy port. The Xarifa came up with us in the course of the night, having had constant bad Aveather, in which she had sprung her jib-boom.

Marseilles is by no means an agreeable residence ; the climate is changeable, with cold winds and frequent fogs. The inn was detestable, and neither society nor amusement was to be found. There is a curious chapel here on a height near the town ; it is dedicated to the Virgin, and is filled with various offerings from mariners. The walls are covered with pictures of all sorts and sizes, representing every varied scene of danger and distress. This is an old and classical custom, dating from the most remote antiquity. There is a fine view from this spot of the harbour and sur rounding hills. During our stay at Marseilles, Ave Avent for tAvo days to Toulon, and saw the magnificent harbour, the land-locked bay, and the dockyard.

We strolled about the orange groves and gardens, admired the beautiful view, and returned to Marseilles, enchanted with our expedition. Our intention had been to proceed to Naples, but Ave received intelligence that altered our plans, and obliged us to return to England.
